    <ol>
            <li>The shaves with this head are marginal at best.  </li>
            <li>Great price!  </li>
            <li>Delivery was excellent and ahead of schedule.</li>
            <li>Works Great and delivered on time.</li>
            <li>Fits well in the unit but not as good as the original!!!</li>
            <li>The one that came with My razor is twice as good as this one.</li>
            <li>The item does not give a good cut at all.  </li>
            <li>The replacement head for Norelco RQ-10 Shaver fit perfectly and performS better than the Norelco replacement heads ever did.</li>
            <li>If you own a sensitouch 3D shaver, do not buy this replacement head.</li>
            <li>Design appears to be equivalent or superior to the original equipment heads.  </li>
            <li>- I should have known better.</li>
            <li>Since Amazon was no longer able to supply the RQ12 razor head for my Norelco razor, which I also bought from Amazon, I had to but this substitute replacement head.</li>
            <li>Better than the RQ10.  </li>
            <li>Shaves as well or better than Norelco&#x27;s replacement.  </li>
            <li>I bought a new shaver and am now happy.  </li>
            <li>Get a new razor from another company, it&#x27;ll serve you better!!</li>
            <li>Better than original</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t  give clean shave at all ,,had to throw it for safe disposal ,</li>
            <li>my husband says it works fine</li>
            <li>Cheap knock-off.</li>
            <li>said it would fit my razor.  </li>
            <li>Which is primarily what I wanted</li>
            <li>This head was cheaply made, the cutter blade was too flexable to cut well, and the perforated head would not cut longer whiskers.</li>
            <li>Does not shave nearly as smooth as original head.  </li>
            <li>The replacement works but is thicker than the original.</li>
            <li>i can not use it.&lt;br /&gt;i have to buy original one by philips</li>
            <li>Thought I was ordering an original Norelco replacement head</li>
            <li>This replacement head looks and fits like the original, but that were the similarities stop.</li>
            <li>I guess if you don&#x27;t take it apart to clean it</li>
            <li>Does not give a clean shave.  </li>
            <li>Cheap version much too large even though it kind of fits</li>
            <li>While mine did fit, it pinched and pulled and didn&#x27;t shave at all as well as the original, now over a year old.</li>
            <li>Has deeper whisker collection well and cleans MUCH easier than the original.  </li>
            <li>The positive: it shipped quickly and it was cheap.&lt;br</li>
            <li>this assembly is slightly larger than the original one which means your razor won&#x27;t fit in it&#x27;s travel case.  </li>
            <li>Not what I expected ,I thought they were original equipment replacements,but they will be ok</li>
            <li>This product, when examined compared to a genuine Philips replacement head, is clearly an inferior knockoff and should not be sold as a replacement part.  </li>
            <li>Save your $$ and buy a real replacement!</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t know about the rq12 problems, but I&#x27;m very pleased with mine at roughly half the cost.</li>
            <li>In the past, we have always ordered the Norelco replacement and it has always been good.</li>
            <li>The new head blade cutter did not cut as if it were new, I have had many new cutter heads and all worked very well.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Do not  buy this cheaply made head cutter for sensotouch 3d shaver simply  </li>
            <li>I hope that the proper replacement head will become available soon.</li>
            <li>Plus whenever I would shave, after shaving, my Norelco shaver would light up &#x27;three head&#x27; in red giving the appearance the heads were not on correctly or something.  </li>
            <li>Its designed differently than the original razor head.</li>
            <li>This generic replacement head did not work like the original.</li>
            <li>This product was unsatisfactory, the blades pull my boyfriends facial hair and irritate his skin and doesn&#x27;t match the size or blade type of the original razor.</li>
            <li>After about two months, I have yet to get a shave that was equal to the ones I was getting with the original.  </li>
            <li>After cleaning it once or twice, one of the heads that can be popped/swung open to clean and rinse broke.  </li>
            <li>What I found to be the most trouble is taking it apart to clean and putting it back together.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m waiting on how long this shaving head lasts as compared to the original Phillips product.  </li>
            <li>I am surprised Amazon would send out a inferior product without checking because I have purchased many Norelco razor heads as well as other product from Amazon Prime with no problems</li>
            <li>Does not give a close shave right out of the box, I would not recommend this product, Chinese made.</li>
            <li>Will definitely go with original replacement next time.</li>
            <li>First time we have ordered a generic razor replacement for the razor.  </li>
            <li>Would definitely be interested in sending it back.</li>
            <li>Not as sharp as the original equipment.</li>
            <li>It apears to be new but it pulls the beard and doesn&#x27;t cut as well as the old one.</li>
            <li>I am now using my old razor head and am trying how to find out how to get a RQ10 from Norelco without paying an arm and a leg that is not a clone I need help because I like my razor and this one you sent me</li>
            <li>So far, holding up well.  </li>
            <li>It is nowhere near the quality of the R12 head.</li>
            <li>Lesser rotory blades.does not shave as new</li>
            <li>(no more using a needle to clean).  </li>
            <li>They clearly are not the same as the originals.  </li>
            <li>I put the year old unit back on and it shaved :</li>
            <li>Luckily, I kept the old (dull) head which I use on trips.</li>
            <li>Hard to clean  </li>
            <li>It fit my razor but the shave was so poor that  I went back to the old shaving head.</li>

            <li> Blades did not fit properly in the holder.</li>
            <li> The product performs as expected.  </li>

            <li> This is not original equipment.  </li>
            <li> The shaver head did not fit my razor.</li>
            <li> It is larger than the factory RQ-10 replacement heads (will not fit in the case); however, it is less expensive than the factory RQ-10 Head.</li>
            <li> Unbelievable  works excelent</li>
            <li> : I hate to send things back, but I will be sending this back!</li>

            <li> It is a real waste of money I use them one time.</li>
            <li> I used the new shaver blade replacement head for the 1st time today and was sorely disappointed.</li>
            <li> does not fit the intended razor properly and a very poor shave&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s a knockoff made in china and very poor quality</li>
            <li> The blades I bought must have been used and attempted to be &amp;#34;RE-SHARPENED&amp;#34; to failure.</li>
            <li> This is a clone razor head and is absolutely no good  </li>
            <li> Subpar quality, irritating to the skin, does not remove hair.  </li>
            <li> Performance was poor.</li>
            <li> Not impressed with the quality of the replacement head.</li>

            <li> Very tough on beard and pulls.  </li>
            <li> Very poor substitute.</li>
            <li> Quality of this product was very poor.  </li>
            <li> It was horrible, if I could give it minus stars, I would.</li>
            <li> You could tell why it isn&#x27;t cutting whiskers and you could feel the mechanism coming apart as you shave.</li>
            <li> unhappy.</li>
            <li> terrible product, it scrape and irritate the skin, I would not want to ever waste my money on it</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is not original equipment.  It is not close.  The one that came with My razor is twice as good as this one. I will not not buy it again.</li>
            <li> Subpar quality, irritating to the skin, does not remove hair.  This product, when examined compared to a genuine Philips replacement head, is clearly an inferior knockoff and should not be sold as a replacement part.  It does not work.</li>
            <li> Not impressed with the quality of the replacement head. Will definitely go with original replacement next time.</li>
            <li> Its designed differently than the original razor head.It apears to be new but it pulls the beard and doesn&#x27;t cut as well as the old one.I don&amp;#34;t blame the seller but the manufacture.</li>
            <li> While mine did fit, it pinched and pulled and didn&#x27;t shave at all as well as the original, now over a year old. Shouldn&#x27;t be sold as a replacement part. Very poor substitute.</li>
            <li> Did not perform anything like the one made by Norelco, had to return for a refund, would never buy again.</li>
            <li> The positive: it shipped quickly and it was cheap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The negative: it was cheap because it was a lousy Chinese knockoff part.  The blades are made of cheap tin and has a hard enough time cutting through air, let alone whiskers.  Definitely not a real norelco part.  My advice...save some $$ and try shaving with a spoke.</li>
            <li> It is different what I had before</li>
            <li> This is junk and it does not cut my beard. Please,do not buy this.</li>
            <li> Cheap version much too large even though it kind of fits</li>
            <li> he said it doesn&#x27;&#x27;t cut sharp, it actually pulls and &amp;#34;bites&amp;#34;. He would not recommend this.</li>
            <li> First time we have ordered a generic razor replacement for the razor.  In the past, we have always ordered the Norelco replacement and it has always been good. The item does not give a good cut at all.  Would definitely be interested in sending it back.</li>
            <li> Design appears to be equivalent or superior to the original equipment heads.  Too early to tell if the blades will stay sharp as long as Norelco&#x27;s.  Warning: this assembly is slightly larger than the original one which means your razor won&#x27;t fit in it&#x27;s travel case.  Luckily, I kept the old (dull) head which I use on trips.</li>
            <li> Better than original *****</li>
            <li> Terrible. I went for price instead of quality - I should have known better. My husband said it doesn&#x27;t cut well, and it pulls the hair.</li>
            <li> This is a clone razor head and is absolutely no good  I am now using my old razor head and am trying how to find out how to get a RQ10 from Norelco without paying an arm and a leg that is not a clone I need help because I like my razor and this one you sent me is terrible not even in a Norelco box  I am surprised Amazon would send out a inferior product without checking because I have purchased many Norelco razor heads as well as other product from Amazon Prime with no problems</li>
            <li> I agree with ALL the negative comments about this replacement head. What I found to be the most trouble is taking it apart to clean and putting it back together. You could tell why it isn&#x27;t cutting whiskers and you could feel the mechanism coming apart as you shave. I guess if you don&#x27;t take it apart to clean it you&#x27;ll just have to throw it away after 2-3 weeks of use. Shame on Norelco-Phillips for charging $119.99 for a replacement!!! This one is a bad replacement, Don&amp;#34;t buy it!! Get a new razor from another company, it&#x27;ll serve you better!!</li>
            <li> on time and as promised</li>

            <li> Not as sharp as the original equipment.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected ,I thought they were original equipment replacements,but they will be ok</li>
            <li> Do not  buy this cheaply made head cutter for sensotouch 3d shaver simply  it doesn&#x27;t  give clean shave at all ,,had to throw it for safe disposal ,</li>
            <li> said it would fit my razor.  does not. unhappy.</li>
            <li> bad quality. i can not use it.&lt;br /&gt;i have to buy original one by philips</li>
            <li> Head looks great....but no blades. Which is primarily what I wanted</li>
            <li> I am not a fan of &amp;#34;aftermarket&amp;#34; products, whether car wiper blades or anything. I used the new shaver blade replacement head for the 1st time today and was sorely disappointed. I put the year old unit back on and it shaved :better&amp;#34;!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can I not get a OEM unit through Norelco?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS: I hate to send things back, but I will be sending this back!</li>
            <li> These are the worst shaver blade replacement I have ever purchased. I would not recommend this to anyone and less they were my enemy. It is a real waste of money I use them one time.</li>
            <li> Thought I was ordering an original Norelco replacement head this is not.  It is a knockoff.  Does not shave nearly as smooth as original head.  Very tough on beard and pulls.  Won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> This product was unsatisfactory, the blades pull my boyfriends facial hair and irritate his skin and doesn&#x27;t match the size or blade type of the original razor. Misleading and upsetting.</li>
            <li> This replacement head looks and fits like the original, but that were the similarities stop. I bought this shaving head because it was about 25% the cost of others offered.  After about two months, I have yet to get a shave that was equal to the ones I was getting with the original.  The shaves with this head are marginal at best.  Frankly if I had realized the cost involved with replacement of the shaving head; I probably would have bought a different razor.</li>
            <li> It is larger than the factory RQ-10 replacement heads (will not fit in the case); however, it is less expensive than the factory RQ-10 Head.</li>
            <li> not a true replacement for the head I was looking for&lt;br /&gt;pictuer was not clear as to the heads</li>
            <li> poor quality; shaver cover doesn&#x27;t fit.</li>
            <li> Fits well in the unit but not as good as the original!!! It&#x27;s allright for the money.</li>
            <li> This deserves a ZERO. Save your $$ and buy a real replacement! Horrible!</li>
            <li> Unbelievable  works excelent</li>
            <li> does not fit the intended razor properly and a very poor shave&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s a knockoff made in china and very poor quality</li>
            <li> Works Great and delivered on time.</li>
            <li> Since Amazon was no longer able to supply the RQ12 razor head for my Norelco razor, which I also bought from Amazon, I had to but this substitute replacement head. It was horrible, if I could give it minus stars, I would. This head was cheaply made, the cutter blade was too flexable to cut well, and the perforated head would not cut longer whiskers. I hope that the proper replacement head will become available soon. If you own a sensitouch 3D shaver, do not buy this replacement head. It works, but it works badly.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work.  Can I get my money back?</li>
            <li> Blades did not fit properly in the holder. Performance was poor.</li>
            <li> my husband says it works fine and it&#x27;s a quarter of the price of the name brand one.</li>
            <li> The product performs as expected.  I&#x27;m waiting on how long this shaving head lasts as compared to the original Phillips product.  So far, holding up well.  Great price!  Delivery was excellent and ahead of schedule.</li>
            <li> One word Junk.  Does not give a clean shave.  Hard to clean  Tried to get just replacement foil and blades but are dscontiued,, Seems to be just another way to get ripped off</li>
            <li> They do not work well at all. I will never buy another one.</li>
            <li> It fit my razor but the shave was so poor that  I went back to the old shaving head.</li>
            <li> The replacement head for Norelco RQ-10 Shaver fit perfectly and performS better than the Norelco replacement heads ever did.</li>
            <li> Quality of this product was very poor.  It did not work properly on my Norelco Razor.  After cleaning it once or twice, one of the heads that can be popped/swung open to clean and rinse broke.  The spring mechanism that holds it in place popped out and I was unable to fix it.  Plus whenever I would shave, after shaving, my Norelco shaver would light up &#x27;three head&#x27; in red giving the appearance the heads were not on correctly or something.  I would not recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> Does not give a close shave right out of the box, I would not recommend this product, Chinese made.</li>
            <li> The new head blade cutter did not cut as if it were new, I have had many new cutter heads and all worked very well.&lt;br /&gt;I almost felt like this head was either defective or reconditioned.</li>
            <li> did not work properly</li>
            <li> If you are looking to replace your R12 razor head skip this.  It is nowhere near the quality of the R12 head.</li>
            <li> fit fine, quality of shave was terrible.  It pulled my whiskers and didn&#x27;t cut them.  I bought a new shaver and am now happy.  The blades I bought must have been used and attempted to be &amp;#34;RE-SHARPENED&amp;#34; to failure.</li>
            <li> terrible product, it scrape and irritate the skin, I would not want to ever waste my money on it</li>
            <li> Better than the RQ10.  Has deeper whisker collection well and cleans MUCH easier than the original.  (no more using a needle to clean).  Shaves as well or better than Norelco&#x27;s replacement.  Don&#x27;t know about the rq12 problems, but I&#x27;m very pleased with mine at roughly half the cost.</li>
