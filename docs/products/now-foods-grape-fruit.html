            <li>Sooo in love with this oil.</li>
            <li>I love that I have nothing to worry about.</li>
            <li>It makes the whole house smell good not just the laundry.</li>
            <li>clothes and washer smell great,  Works better than an essential oil diffuser.  </li>

            <li>students can&#x27;t get enough :)  </li>
            <li>Great smelling and very concentrated Oil , be careful not to use this oil without dilution and even when you dilute it dont use it any plastic containers it will eat the plastic immediately on contact - ruined two water cups at work with only one drop of this concentrated oil in the 250 ml of water in plastic cup .otherwise</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too strong and mixes well, would definitely buy again!</li>
            <li>I add a few drops to my household cleaning products and it makes my house smell so fresh.  </li>
            <li>Very nice fragrance, I&#x27;m just disappointed it doesn&#x27;t last longer in a scent burner.  </li>

            <li> I add a few drops to my household cleaning products and it makes my house smell so fresh.  I love the unexpected grapefruit smell over your average fake lemon scented cleaners.  Can also be used to keep spiders away, just dab it around your windows.  I&#x27;ve heard it can also be used to keep cats off furniture, but mine don&#x27;t seem to mind it.</li>
            <li> This oil has worked wonders for me and my mom!!! In just a week sniffing and adding it to my water I have lost a lot of water weight and I have gotten compliments. I even use it as aromatherapy at work for those who need it I would definitely recommend this to everyone eapecially since I cannot stand the taste of grapefruit. This works best!</li>
            <li> Now is my favorite EO brand!!</li>
            <li> The grapefruit is great!!!! It was a excellent buy and came on time. It mixes well with the other oils. Absolutely perfect for aromatherapy. I definitely recommend purchasing this item.</li>
