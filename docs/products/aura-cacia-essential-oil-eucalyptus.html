            <li> The quality of the Eucalyptus oil from Aura Cacia is much better than the cheap crap I got off ebay.</li>
            <li> I spray my carpet and vacuum.  </li>
            <li> This happens to other people who are near it too.</li>
            <li> Their prices are higher than NOW brand and other competitors, but I&#x27;m a firm believer that you get what you pay</li>
            <li> I add this to the humidifer in my daughter&#x27;s room when she has a cold or congestion and it helps her sleep better.</li>
            <li> They sent it to me 2 days earlier than expected.  </li>
            <li> A half ounce bottle has more power than this 2 oz fake.</li>
            <li> It would be acceptable if it were a good fake, but this one is a watered-down fake.</li>
            <li> The other use is before you are going to move your bowels</li>
            <li> I use this oil in my nebulizer along with compatible oils to relieve my sinus congestion due to seasonal allergies.</li>
            <li> Not only is this clearly a fake, because the label was printed in black and white when all other Aura Cacia labels are in color, but also the strength of the drops don&#x27;t hold a candle to the last Aura Cacia Eucalyptus Oil I had.</li>
            <li> We have never been let down with Aura Cacia.  </li>
            <li> If I read other reviews I will know before I waste my money.</li>
            <li> And dab a little on my shirt when my nose is stuffy.</li>

            <li> I use eucalyptus and mint oils in sauna inhalation / aroma therapy for the past 30 years.</li>
            <li> Fake product, looks different than picture, homemade label.</li>
            <li> I bought this to use in my homemade bug repellent and other potions.  </li>

            <li> Great price for how much you get and smells great!!! I recommend this product. I like to use it when I am stuffed or my kids are.</li>
            <li> Love these oils but a lil expensive to keep repurchasing</li>
            <li> Aura Cacia is the best brand of oils that I have used and they don&#x27;t disappoint.  The 2oz is always nice to give you that extra if you use a lot.</li>

            <li> I use it in my bath.  And dab a little on my shirt when my nose is stuffy.</li>
            <li> love, love, love, eucalyptus, but not as long lasting as aura caria i purchased in stores</li>
            <li> I make the water and use it every day. 20 drops per spray bottle of distilled water. I spray my carpet and vacuum.  My house smells great!</li>
            <li> The only essential oil I purchase is Aura Cacia either lavender or eucalyptus...both are great and at a decent price!</li>
            <li> This is a great smelling oil that I use almost every night to help me breathe.  I put some on a cotton ball in a glass cup, and sleep great without feeling stuffy and waking up during the night to blow my nose.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell as great as my other oils ( I normally purchase from Native American or YL) but I use this one in a diffuser instead of therapeutic use because of that.</li>
            <li> I purchased several bottles of this essential oil to use in making bath salts.  It is an excellent product, one that I will purchase again.</li>
            <li> I use eucalyptus and mint oils in sauna inhalation / aroma therapy for the past 30 years. This is a best brand for this purpose.&lt;br /&gt;Do not buy other chipper ones.</li>

            <li> Fake product, looks different than picture, homemade label. Do not buy this product. If I read other reviews I will know before I waste my money.</li>
            <li> I am a fan of Aura Cacia essential oils. I think this Eucalyptus might be my favorite. Great quality. I have used it several different ways. Would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> Excellent packing, great item, everything I could have asked for!</li>
            <li> received timely and intact</li>
            <li> I love more organic smell of Eucalyptus but most people will never know the difference in smell. Its good to have</li>
            <li> We buy this oil for many reasons, if you love the smell of the spa and you go to the gym and use the sauna, steam room but a few drops on a wash cloth and place it over where the steam comes out and you will love it. You can also place a few drops in the shower on a wash cloth and let the steam in the shower deliver that spa like smell.&lt;br /&gt;The aroma from the Eucalyptus is fantastic!, this brand is vey good high quality and very concentrated. The other use is before you are going to move your bowels put a drop or two in the toilet and there will be almost no oder except the beautiful smell of eucalyptus.</li>
            <li> I recently ordered this product and I love it.  The price is great but the product is excellent.  I use it daily in my home.  We are breathing much better, as well as sleeping better.  I use it in massage oil.  It has a very healing effect on the body.  The shipping company is SB Natural Products.  They sent it to me 2 days earlier than expected.  Will I order this product again?  Definitely.  Thank you Amazon for great customer service.</li>
            <li> First:  I did not buy this product to plump my lips like everyone else.  I bought this to use in my homemade bug repellent and other potions.  I found it to be the perfect strength and scent.  It works great for everything I need it for.</li>
            <li> I only buy Aura Cacia essential oils.  You can trust that you are getting a high quality product as they test all of they oils for purity.  I use this oil in my nebulizer along with compatible oils to relieve my sinus congestion due to seasonal allergies.</li>
            <li> We use this in our humidifier/diffuser to help with my allergies. It smells good and seems to help open up my sinuses a bit.</li>
            <li> Whenever I use this essential oil (and only now brand!) I cannot sleep all night. I don&#x27;t know why kind of chemical they add to the oil during the process or if they don&#x27;t use organic herbs but that is what happens. This happens to other people who are near it too. Oh, and even if I use it in the morning it still has that effect by night</li>
            <li> Not only is this clearly a fake, because the label was printed in black and white when all other Aura Cacia labels are in color, but also the strength of the drops don&#x27;t hold a candle to the last Aura Cacia Eucalyptus Oil I had. Don&#x27;t buy from ATL Warehouse. It would be acceptable if it were a good fake, but this one is a watered-down fake. A half ounce bottle has more power than this 2 oz fake.</li>
