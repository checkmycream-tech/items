            <li>I love this stuff</li>
            <li>Love this Lip Gloss.</li>
            <li>More like lipstick than gloss.</li>
            <li>Slicks Gloss Sticks are a great product and very beneficial, whether used alone or over a lip color.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it for years now and am always well satisfied.</li>
            <li>Excellent product, if only CoverGirl would offer in stores again.  </li>
            <li>I discovered Lip Slicks about 3 months ago and when I returned to the store to purchase more, I could not find them in any store, pharmacy or grocery store.  </li>
            <li>It is light and easy to apply throughout the day without a mirror.  </li>
            <li>It was no longer available in the drug stores, but I found it on line and ordered 2.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t really know why, but I love this lipstick.  </li>
            <li>am very grateful for being able for the 2 I purchased and will use sparingly.  </li>
            <li>just love this product because it keeps my lips moist and I am older.  </li>
            <li>love this clear gloss.</li>
            <li>unlike many, many other lip gloss is not sticky</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve read many a review where the woman loved the product and was confused as to why it wasn&#x27;t made any longer.  </li>
            <li>It also arrived quickly and was reasonably priced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Have used for many years but have had difficulty finding it in the last couple of years.  </li>
            <li>Leaves a clean clear gloss.  </li>
            <li>I searched a long time to find it, and it is everything I love in a lip gloss.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very light ... not hard and thick like most lip balms.  </li>
            <li>I like that it doesn&#x27;t have a strong color and appears basically clear and natural.  </li>
            <li>There r so many other exact lipstick colors out there like this.</li>
            <li>It goes on and stays really shiny.</li>
            <li>Really keeps moisture in, and is not sticky or tacky.</li>
            <li>Has production really been stopped by the manufacturer?  </li>
            <li>It keeps my lips moisturized and really helps prevent chapped lips.  </li>
            <li>I originally ordered this 2-pack in May 2014; I&#x27;m just now about to finish the 2nd tube.  </li>
            <li>Obviously I like it very much!</li>
            <li>It seemed terribly expensive to me (compared to store prices - when it was stocked) at $26.00/pkg of 2, but I know a buyer has to pay MORE for something that has a finite amount available.</li>
            <li>Makes no sense to me because Cover Girl Clear Lip</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure this was a fake product.</li>
            <li>had left if price was normal.  </li>
            <li>This product has been discontinued from the general marketplace which is a shame because it is a very nice lip gloss.  :(</li>

            <li> We can vote to reinstate it (and other discontinued CG items) at: [...]</li>
            <li> This is just sad..</li>
            <li> I also found it was expensive.  </li>
            <li> I am so sorry Cover Girl choose to not carry it anymore.</li>
            <li> I like that it doesn&#x27;t have some weird added fruity flavor.  </li>
            <li> Sorry!</li>
            <li> :-(  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m very sad to see it was discontinued! :(</li>

            <li> Since Cover Girl stopped production of this, customers are up in arms.  Hopefully, they&#x27;ll bring it back.  According to customer service at Cover Girl, a hue and cry has been raised.  Hopefully, Cover Girl is listening.</li>

            <li> I love this stuff and I&#x27;m very sad to see it was discontinued! :( Please bring it back cover girl!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> saw these were discontinued so I stocked up via amazon. clear is a great moisturizer, good price, wears well and unlike many, many other lip gloss is not sticky</li>
            <li> love this clear gloss. I am so sorry Cover Girl choose to not carry it anymore.</li>
            <li> My mother was thrilled.  We could no longer find this in local stores.</li>
            <li> I bought 6 of these because it seems cover girl discontinued it and is no longer found in stores.  Leaves a clean clear gloss.  Perfect since I don&#x27;t wear makeup</li>
            <li> This product has been discontinued from the general marketplace which is a shame because it is a very nice lip gloss.  :(</li>
            <li> Love this Lip Gloss. Really keeps moisture in, and is not sticky or tacky.</li>
            <li> I have 4 of these in the drawer...don&#x27;t want to run out.  Best gloss ever!</li>
            <li> More like lipstick than gloss.</li>
            <li> Have used for many years but have had difficulty finding it in the last couple of years.  When it can be located, it&#x27;s quite expensive, but I like the product so much, I&#x27;ve paid the price.  Has production really been stopped by the manufacturer?  Makes no sense to me because Cover Girl Clear Lip Slicks Gloss Sticks are a great product and very beneficial, whether used alone or over a lip color.  Sigh...</li>
            <li> I use this as a lip gloss in the winter.  It keeps my lips moisturized and really helps prevent chapped lips.  It&#x27;s very light ... not hard and thick like most lip balms.  I&#x27;ve used it for years now and am always well satisfied.</li>
            <li> It is no longer sold in stores, but I&#x27;m delighted to have found it here.  I originally ordered this 2-pack in May 2014; I&#x27;m just now about to finish the 2nd tube.  (It is May 2016 as I write this.)  It seemed terribly expensive to me (compared to store prices - when it was stocked) at $26.00/pkg of 2, but I know a buyer has to pay MORE for something that has a finite amount available. It is approximately double the cost of in a store.  Excellent product, if only CoverGirl would offer in stores again.  I&#x27;ve read many a review where the woman loved the product and was confused as to why it wasn&#x27;t made any longer.  I join that group. :-(  We can vote to reinstate it (and other discontinued CG items) at: [...]</li>
            <li> I discovered Lip Slicks about 3 months ago and when I returned to the store to purchase more, I could not find them in any store, pharmacy or grocery store.  So, I went online and discovered through Amazon that they were not being made anymore so I purchased the last 2 that were for sale.&lt;br /&gt;I just love this product because it keeps my lips moist and I am older.  I do not like lipsticks or lip gloss and thought I had finally found the pefect moisturizer.  I am so dismayed and wonder why Cover Girl stopped making this product!&lt;br /&gt;I am very grateful for being able for the 2 I purchased and will use sparingly.  Don&#x27;t know what I will use after these are gone.</li>
            <li> I love this lip gloss!  I like that it doesn&#x27;t have some weird added fruity flavor.  I like that it doesn&#x27;t have a strong color and appears basically clear and natural.  I like that it moisturizes my lips without feeling too thick or too sticky.  I hate the feel of most lipsticks that either feel too heavy, or too glossy and wet.  It is light and easy to apply throughout the day without a mirror.  It also arrived quickly and was reasonably priced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, I understand it has been discontinued!  I have used this lip gloss for years and I don&#x27;t know what I will do without it!  I searched a long time to find it, and it is everything I love in a lip gloss.  I haven&#x27;t found anything like it, so if anyone knows of a similar product, PLEASE let me know!</li>
            <li> I love this lipgloss!! So upset when they stopped making it! I am so happy that I can still get it from Amazon!!</li>
            <li> This is the kind of lipstick that I like. I can put it on without showing mistakes. That to me works. Thank you.</li>
