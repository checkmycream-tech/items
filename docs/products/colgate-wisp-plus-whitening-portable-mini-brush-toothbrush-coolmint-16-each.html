            <li>It&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li>, so easy to use and dispose of.  </li>
            <li>Perfect for on the go or in my case a 4 day hospital stay where I needed my mouth to feel fresh &amp; clean, unlike the standard hospital gunk you are given.</li>
            <li>If you have never tried a Colgate Wisp, you are missing out on a wonderful product.</li>
            <li>Her mouth is very small &amp; those are perfectly sized for her :)</li>

            <li> A handy item to have in my purse.  Small, easy to use, and freshens the breath while giving a quick clean of the teeth. My only complaint is that they are a bit pricey to use everyday.</li>
            <li> Perfect for when I need to brush on the go or at work. Wish they hadn&#x27;t stopped selling these in Australia but they&#x27;re worth the shipping fees!</li>
            <li> These are great.  The bristles are pretty strong, so if you have irritated or bleeding gums this may not be for you.  Definitely gets all the plaque off my molars that my regular brush doesn&#x27;t quite get.  Seriously leaves me feeling like I just left the dentist.</li>
            <li> Great!  Nice to have at work, so easy to use and dispose of.  Brings back that confidence when you&#x27;re mouth isn&#x27;t feeling/tasting/smelling top notch</li>

            <li> Wonderful to carry with you.</li>
            <li> just what I wanted - My husband &amp; I like them for &amp;#34;on the go&amp;#34; &amp; then our Maltese, Chanel, can have her teeth brushed too! Her mouth is very small &amp; those are perfectly sized for her :)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok my son said they are very hard bristles and I purchased these for him to take to school for after lunch because he has braces. He didn&#x27;t use them it hurt his teeth and gums.</li>
            <li> Perfect for on the go or in my case a 4 day hospital stay where I needed my mouth to feel fresh &amp; clean, unlike the standard hospital gunk you are given. Clean teeth &amp; fresh breath!</li>
            <li> great,no need for water,very convient and practical, best jimmy mack</li>
            <li> If you have never tried a Colgate Wisp, you are missing out on a wonderful product. I carry Wisps at all times in my car to help when I want to freshen my mouth &amp; breath. These have become impossible to find in my local stores &amp; I must now buy them online but am so glad they are available.</li>
            <li> I use these all the time. Great for travel, work or anywhere you need to freshen up.</li>
            <li> Colgate Wisps are useless, they are so stiff you can&#x27;t &amp;#34;brush&amp;#34; with them. I purchased them because I have Invisalign and need to brush after every meal. I can&#x27;t with these because they are stiff bristles that don&#x27;t move. The only thing that is good on them is the taste and the closer on the end.</li>
            <li> PERFECT! Happy I got them they are awsome!! Buying morre!!</li>
