            <li>/&gt;About 10 years ago I noticed a co-worker always had really great makeup that lasted</li>
            <li>I am 67 and my skin is in great shape for my age.</li>
            <li>There are so many colors of foundation and blushes and the mineral veil is the best!  </li>
            <li>When they say that this product is good for your skin, they know what they are talking about.</li>
            <li>light weight, perfect!</li>
            <li>Good buy</li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>The first of the &amp;#34;no make-up make-ups&amp;#34; is still the best.</li>
            <li>Its amazing.  </li>
            <li>Good pricing on one of my favorite products.</li>
            <li>Covers very well - gives my freckled face a more flawless look.</li>
            <li>best benefit is that it&#x27;s natural and I am 48 and don&#x27;t do all the facials, etc.</li>
            <li>It just adds a finished step to your face that really looks good!</li>
            <li>I love this product, but the advertisement said &#x27;full-size&#x27;, and it was not.</li>
            <li>Guess it&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>I used to use the pressed powders on top of my foundation and it would just look like I had a powder mask.  </li>
            <li>I love this.</li>
            <li>I love how it feels on my face</li>
            <li>The new &amp;#34;slide-shut&amp;#34; container is very nice for stopping messes, too.</li>
            <li>I has great coverage and is not heavy and does not cake up on face.</li>
            <li>I do not understand what happened with this product; it used to be wonderful, I kept buying it for a few years.</li>
            <li>some days I would forget to wash before I went to bed because it is so comfortable to wear and doesn&#x27;t get greasy or slimy feeling at all.  </li>
            <li>The issue I have is it was not advertised as \\&quot;illuminating\\&quot; mineral veil, it was advertised as original.</li>
            <li>As long as the product isn&#x27;t damaged in any way when I receive it I will be extremely happy with my purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I buy it from different sellers and I was glad I found an &#x27;Original&#x27;.</li>
            <li>Easy to use, lasts all day, looks fresh and natural.</li>
            <li>I have been using Bare Escentuals Mineral veil and also the foundation for many years</li>
            <li>I have been using Bare Escentuals for 3 years now and love their products.</li>
            <li>I love the Bare Escentuals line of products.</li>
            <li>thanks!</li>
            <li>This is so light and just brushing it on with the Bare Minerals brush and you are done.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if this vendor is trying to pull a fast one on us or what,</li>
            <li>Product came in 9gm container, but was only 1/3 full.  </li>
            <li>Please be more specific on the description on future ads.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve enjoyed using Bare Minerals for several years now, and the order I placed recently came in a very timely manner.</li>
            <li>The foundation and the blusher are the main stays of the Bare Escentuals, but this mineral veil puts a finishing touch on your whole face.  </li>
            <li>Heard so much about the Bare Minerals Veil, so I ordered it.  </li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s so easy to carry it with you and when you feel a little oily</li>
            <li>The primer I went to use today  should be  clear in color</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not bad, but it&#x27;s noticeable, and I usually have to gently break it up with my makeup brush before I apply it.</li>
            <li>Think I will just stick with the Bare Minerals Face Color.</li>
            <li>The Bare Minerals</li>
            <li>that I have found Bare Escentuals.</li>
            <li>Mineral Veil gives a soft finish to my skin and is the final step that I take to make it appear that I am wearing no makeup.</li>
            <li>I always used to have issues with my face looking too greasy by the end of the day, but whenever I use this product, I have a very NATURALLY matte face regardless of how long I&#x27;ve had it on.</li>
            <li>I have been using bare minerals for years and ordered this and also the primer and the powder is NOT of bare minerals quality and is to white!!!  </li>
            <li>I have used Bare Minerals Mineral Veil for several years now.  </li>
            <li>I use mineral veil over regular liquid foundation or bare minerals foundation.  </li>
            <li>I am so upset that someone would try to sell this as the Bare Minerals brand when it obviously is NOT!!!</li>

            <li> I love this product, but the advertisement said &#x27;full-size&#x27;, and it was not. However, I would buy again, just because it is a wonderful product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve enjoyed using Bare Minerals for several years now, and the order I placed recently came in a very timely manner. The issue I have is it was not advertised as \\&quot;illuminating\\&quot; mineral veil, it was advertised as original. The last thing I need at the age of 44 is to look like someone who is 20. Sparkles are for teenagers. Please be more specific on the description on future ads. $20 plus shipping down the crapper.</li>
            <li> Heard so much about the Bare Minerals Veil, so I ordered it.  It&#x27;s too white looking when I apply it.  Think I will just stick with the Bare Minerals Face Color.</li>
            <li> Guess it&#x27;s okay. Gave it to my daughter.</li>
            <li> I have used Bare Minerals Mineral Veil for several years now.  Don&#x27;t want to be without it.  It just adds a finished step to your face that really looks good!</li>
            <li> I do not understand what happened with this product; it used to be wonderful, I kept buying it for a few years. This is the 3rd time (and last time) I buy it from different sellers and I was glad I found an &#x27;Original&#x27;. But this product also looks like corn starch on my face when I use it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years, but buying it from places like Sephora, etc. What I purchased from this vendor is NOT mineral veil. The packaging looks the same, but its much thicker and it coats your face in a thick white - not the typical sheer, lightweight coverage I&#x27;m used to with this product. I don&#x27;t know if this vendor is trying to pull a fast one on us or what, but I&#x27;m pretty angry I paid $30 for something that is not what it says it is. Amazon shouldn&#x27;t work with this vendor any longer.</li>
            <li> I have been using Bare Escentuals Mineral veil and also the foundation for many years and I always get compliments about my skin.  I recommend it.</li>
            <li> This particular container of mineral veil seems a little clumpy to me. It&#x27;s not bad, but it&#x27;s noticeable, and I usually have to gently break it up with my makeup brush before I apply it.</li>
            <li> the swivel part doesn&#x27;t seem to seal as snugly as other ones that I&#x27;ve had before.</li>
            <li> This powder makes my skin look like I have no pores.  Its amazing.  The color is perfect and lasts all day.</li>
            <li> Covers very well - gives my freckled face a more flawless look.</li>
            <li> Good pricing on one of my favorite products.</li>
            <li> Have used this for years.  Haven&#x27;t received the product yet, but I will not be buying from Ulta anymore.  $25 to $30 a pop there depending on what product you buy.  As long as the product isn&#x27;t damaged in any way when I receive it I will be extremely happy with my purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About 10 years ago I noticed a co-worker always had really great makeup that lasted and I had problems since I have an oily t-zone with dry cheeks and I had gone through the mousse foundations, pressed powders, liquid foundations, etc. from the drug store and department stores.  It just felt like I was wearing a really gross mask on my face and I could not wait to run to the bathroom sink and wash it off at the end of the day.  The Bare Minerals some days I would forget to wash before I went to bed because it is so comfortable to wear and doesn&#x27;t get greasy or slimy feeling at all.  There are so many colors of foundation and blushes and the mineral veil is the best!  I used to use the pressed powders on top of my foundation and it would just look like I had a powder mask.  This is so light and just brushing it on with the Bare Minerals brush and you are done.  No work trying to blend it into your foundation.  And it&#x27;s so easy to carry it with you and when you feel a little oily just brush it on quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best benefit is that it&#x27;s natural and I am 48 and don&#x27;t do all the facials, etc. and half the time even forget to properly wash my face in the morning and evening, but people are always complementing me for my skin and that I don&#x27;t look as old as I am.  That&#x27;s part genetics, but I also think it&#x27;s how you take care of yourself too.  I will not go back to the other kinds of make-up ever again.  I love this.</li>
            <li> I have been using Bare Escentuals for 3 years now and love their products. I am 67 and my skin is in great shape for my age. When they say that this product is good for your skin, they know what they are talking about. I can not bear the thought of applying liquid to my face now that I have found Bare Escentuals. Mineral Veil gives a soft finish to my skin and is the final step that I take to make it appear that I am wearing no makeup.</li>
            <li> The foundation and the blusher are the main stays of the Bare Escentuals, but this mineral veil puts a finishing touch on your whole face.  I&#x27;d recommend this for people that have been using or just trying the foundation mineral product.</li>
            <li> I love this product! It makes my makeup last ALL day! I always used to have issues with my face looking too greasy by the end of the day, but whenever I use this product, I have a very NATURALLY matte face regardless of how long I&#x27;ve had it on. The new &amp;#34;slide-shut&amp;#34; container is very nice for stopping messes, too.</li>
            <li> I use mineral veil over regular liquid foundation or bare minerals foundation.  It adds perfect amount of \\&quot;extra\\&quot; coverage and makes your skin look flawless.</li>
            <li> I have been using bare minerals for years and ordered this and also the primer and the powder is NOT of bare minerals quality and is to white!!!  The primer I went to use today  should be  clear in color and this was yellow and had an oily fill to it!!!  I am so upset that someone would try to sell this as the Bare Minerals brand when it obviously is NOT!!! This company is a fraud plain and simple!!!</li>
            <li> I love the Bare Escentuals line of products. Have used them for over 10 years.  Mineral Veil is one of my must haves. Great, Great Product!!</li>
            <li> Awesome product, awesome seller!</li>
            <li> light weight, perfect! I love how it feels on my face, it&#x27;s like not wearing makeup at all. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> The first of the &amp;#34;no make-up make-ups&amp;#34; is still the best. Easy to use, lasts all day, looks fresh and natural.</li>
            <li> delivered and correct!  thanks!</li>
            <li> I was so disappointed....your description stated 9gm.  Product came in 9gm container, but was only 1/3 full.  I will never buy from you again and will inform my friends that use this same product not to also.</li>
            <li> I use this makeup all the time. I has great coverage and is not heavy and does not cake up on face. Good buy</li>
