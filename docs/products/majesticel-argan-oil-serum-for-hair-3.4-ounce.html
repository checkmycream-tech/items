            <li>Argan Oil is all around fabulous.</li>
            <li>It is fabulous just like it comes.    </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always loved organ oil for this exact reason since it always seems to do such a great job keeping my hair very well moisturized.</li>
            <li>I was so excited how this product worked for</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m excited to continue using this to help keep it healthier.</li>
            <li>First of all, it comes in a pump dispenser which is so much more convenient than others that have the dropper dispensing system.  </li>
            <li>But so far I love it!  </li>
            <li>I got this at a special promo discount to try and test out.</li>
            <li>I love the Argan Oil, made styling much easier.</li>
            <li>I ordered this because I love the Argan lotion so much.</li>
            <li>Full of not water soluble CONS....</li>
            <li>It comes out thin which is perfect for putting into hair because it can spread so easily.</li>
            <li>Moroccan Argan Oil has helped my hair tremendously.</li>
            <li>I received a free sample of this product and really like it!</li>
            <li>I love coloring my hair a new shade almost every two months.</li>
            <li>I have super curly hair, lots of it, but fine, and this really seems to work.  </li>
            <li>I have dry fine hair and this stuff keeps it nice and shiny.</li>
            <li>Makes my hair shiny without looking oily and maintains my frizzy hair in hot humid weather!</li>
            <li>Lovely oil and made my hair super soft and shiny.  </li>
            <li>I use just a little bit from the roots to the ends of my hair and it makes my hair silky smooth, shiny and completely free from static electricity!</li>
            <li>Worth a try for the price point.</li>
            <li>I got it for a promotional price, but it wasn&#x27;t even worth that.</li>
            <li>Quickly absorbed.</li>
            <li>Worth purchasing.</li>
            <li>Argan oil for the hair will make your hair soft, shiny, manageable and healthy.</li>
            <li>worth messing your hair up.</li>
            <li>I use it in my hair to protect it from the heat of the blowdryer and also to tame fly way hair.</li>
            <li>Yeah right</li>
            <li>i received my Magestic Argan Oil a couple days ago and used it right away.</li>
            <li>It doesnt have a smell and leaves the skin smooth and hair looking brand new</li>
            <li>Hopefully, in a few more weeks, I will see some more hair growth as well.</li>
            <li>My hair was also left looking very silky and it has a nice smell to it.  </li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t used it enough to really give an honest report.</li>
            <li>This is overall a great product, I would definitely purchase it again.</li>
            <li>I mix it in with my conditioner because I don&#x27;t like the smell of this product  very much.</li>
            <li>My dry colored hair is no longer under a hat or up in a pony tail, it is down and bouncy and wonderful!  </li>
            <li>Love the smell and am I definitely adding this to my hair care products and will be ordering it again!</li>
            <li>Fast shipping too!</li>
            <li>I only use this on my ends, but it does seem to keep them healthy and really seal in the moisture!</li>
            <li>Def recommend this product for those who are looking to bring life back to their hair:)</li>
            <li>I sprayed my hair first with leave in conditioner and then followed up with this oil.</li>
            <li>( I have about 20-30 hair products) in my hair and this is the first one that helped with detangling and moisturizing.</li>
            <li>I fell in love with this product the instant it arrived.</li>
            <li>Great quality and pretty thick oil.</li>
            <li>Made my hair feel like silk first time I used it.</li>
            <li>The color is back to normal and my hair is soft and healthy looking once more.  </li>
            <li>This Oil has a different consistency then most of the Argon Oils out there.  </li>
            <li>Moroccan Argan Oil for hair has helped sooo much!</li>
            <li>I only wish it had a better scent.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!!</li>
            <li>It was fun and exciting to try something new.</li>
            <li>It smells really nice and makes my hair super soft after I blow dry it or curl it.</li>
            <li>So far loving it, I lighten my hair regularly</li>
            <li>I definitely recommend this product for anyone who wants to give their hair some love.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a hair straightener addict, but I would never want my dependence on a flat iron to cause me to have anything less than perfectly touchable soft hair.</li>
            <li>My hair has been pretty much every color under the sun, which has wound up making my hair feel brittle and look frizzy.</li>
            <li>The only thing I like about this product is that it&#x27;s got a pump and it dispenses easily.</li>
            <li>This oil keeps my hair feeling super soft, and strong even with regular bleachings.</li>
            <li>Although it isn&#x27;t pure Argan oil, I would buy this again because of how well it goes on her hair.</li>
            <li>What a difference a few weeks make, I love this serum!</li>
            <li>It is the new staple in my hair care regiment and I will definitely purchase more when this is gone.  </li>
            <li>My hair was left feeling very silkly and easy to comb, and I may use this as a pre-treatment for straightening my hair</li>
            <li>It is good on hard todo hair</li>
            <li>My usually wild and frizzy hair is now soft, smooth, and manageable.</li>
            <li>Has left my hair smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li>This is a quality product that is very versatile.</li>
            <li>well they are just conditioning really well.  </li>
            <li>and this product really helped with the dryness of her hair....</li>
            <li>Fast ship, I thought it would make my hair oily, I used 2 pumps and it feels softer and shinier ,  not oily what so ever</li>
            <li>This went straight into the trash.</li>
            <li>I was losing hair so much</li>
            <li>haha.</li>
            <li>I have the type of hair that does whatever it wants to do.</li>
            <li>I had to use 3-4 pumps for my whole head.</li>
            <li>My hair is really curly</li>
            <li>I hope they go out of business real soon.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair smooth, I can feel the different.</li>
            <li>but it was really oily</li>
            <li>And thanks.</li>
            <li>YOU SO MUCH.</li>
            <li>my hair feels now so much softer and it gives my hair shine.</li>
            <li>It has the same smell and texture but so much better because it&#x27;s all natural.</li>
            <li>I have only been using this a short time, but already my hair is straightening so quickly and is smooth.  </li>
            <li>and like I said I have a ton of long, fine hair</li>
            <li>Love it, my hair is soft and long.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d rather just spend a little more and get the pure product, which is why I returned It.</li>
            <li>It tames the frizz and makes my hair smell fantastic all day long.  </li>
            <li>My hair was shinny than normal and it was much easier to style.</li>
            <li>I even tried the hot oil treatments you can buy at department stores, but nothing completely worked.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I live in an extreme climate where the temperatures are below zero for most of the winter.</li>
            <li>I put a little bit more on my hands (i have super thick hair) and used it on the top layer of hair as well.</li>
            <li>The argan oil is thicker than expected for an oil making it easy to apply because it stayed on my fingers</li>
            <li>The scent is over-powering and it&#x27;s a scent I associate with older gentlemen.</li>
            <li>they are high quality</li>
            <li>I got a high discount code, then I tried buy it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this if you have frizzy hair.</li>
            <li>This product was too highly scented for me.</li>
            <li>It is very strong smell and not appealing for women.</li>
            <li>I always brush my hair out in the morning but by evening, there are lots of little tangles and again when I wake up in the morning there are more tangles.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it only once so far - a drop &amp; 1/2 as a leave in conditioner on my clean damp hair...  </li>
            <li>My hair is soft shiny and very manageable.</li>
            <li>Naturally penetrates the hair to help moisturize each layer of the hair strand for long-term hair repair so your hair actually looks and feels healthier, silkier, and extraordinarily shiny.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Moroccan Argan Oil has helped my very dry ends and there has been a significant increase in breakage.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I bet when I apply it to my hair right after washing it will have the same effect and I am hoping add a bit of volume.</li>
            <li>This is more of a plain scent</li>
            <li>Love that it doesn&#x27;t have a heavy scent, and doesn&#x27;t weigh my (fine) hair down or make it look greasy.</li>
            <li>I immediately purchased a new bottle.</li>
            <li>Live what it&#x27;s done to my split ends</li>
            <li>Since argan is considered a dry oil, it absorbs quickly and is not greasy.</li>
            <li>Even after using very sparingly, it still left my hair very greasy, and I don&#x27;t have greasy hair.</li>
            <li>I have only recently discovered how fabulous argan oils are.  </li>
            <li>Some new hair products can leave my skin with an irriation rash as I am very sensitive, but this had no side effects what so ever.</li>
            <li>my hair has never felt so soft!</li>
            <li>My hair looks so much better: shinier and no more</li>
            <li>It was very straight and blindly always and was nice and shiny and soft.</li>
            <li>I received this argan oil serum in the mail today and I am so far very pleasantly surprised!</li>
            <li>Also, argon oil isn&#x27;t even the main ingredient, or even one of the main ingredients-it&#x27;s fourth on the list!</li>
            <li>My hair gets dry and hard to deal with sometimes, so this oil is perfect for helping tame my hair.</li>
            <li>frizzy(which was hard to believe) and it was shiny and looked healthy.</li>
            <li>So far I like the oil a lot, its not greasy.</li>
            <li>Wow</li>
            <li>My frizzy hair is now on controle for the forest tI&#x27;m in nearly 2 decades.</li>
            <li>It tames my hair from the humidity and leaves it soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>This oil worked very well on my daughter&#x27;s mixed textured hair.</li>
            <li>I have a sensitive nose.</li>
            <li>It made my hair so soft and shiny, with no frizz.</li>
            <li>This product makes my hair extremely soft.</li>
            <li>Definately controls frizz while leaving your hair soft.</li>
            <li>I applied a little more trying to distribute it evenly and flat ironed each section.</li>
            <li>My hair is long and extremely frizzy, it tangles easy</li>
            <li>My hair has been so dry and extremely frizzy, this has really calmed down the frizzy and feels shiny clean again!!</li>
            <li>I have a lottt of fine hair and usually oils make my hair appear greasy.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair super shiny and makes my hair less frizzy.</li>
            <li>but I later realized it had a bunch of polymers as the main ingredients (the argan is listed 4th).</li>
            <li>I have very frizzy hair and have tried many products to tame it down.</li>
            <li>Definitely needed something natural that would not give me any reactions and this is it!!</li>
            <li>My hair is always free from frizz after applying a small amount.</li>
            <li>I had a long hair , but I chopped it into jaw length because It was very damaged from bleach..</li>
            <li>I was even able to skip a pedi since my heels were so soft and not their usual dry, cracked selves.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t make our hair oily and we have curly, thick, and fine hair in our family.</li>
            <li>The issue with this Argan oil is that if you read the ingredients, there are many other things in the list and Argan oil is the 3rd or 4th down.</li>
            <li>The argan oil left my hair very soft, and not dry at the ends, and not with the  brittleness always causes it to break.</li>
            <li>I use it on my daughters naturally curly mixed hair and it tames her mane!</li>
            <li>My hair looks younger, feels healther, soft and supple.  </li>
            <li>The thing I love about this serum is that it&#x27;s thick, but still thin enough to feel like I can still spread it easily.</li>
            <li>This requires only a few drops to disperse in your hair and it absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>I normally let my hair air dry in a braid.</li>
            <li>But, after today when applying this oil to my dry hair my blonde hair looks shiny now and feels so soft and natural!</li>
            <li>I have tried to many different shampoos, conditioners, sprays and other hair care product to tame my hair and give it the softness and shine</li>
            <li>This one was by far the most affordable and worked just as well as expensive salon products.</li>
            <li>Serums I&#x27;ve used in the past have been so thick that I end up using way more than I really need to, but that is definitely not a problem with this one!</li>
            <li>I don’t really know how to describe the scent other than your hair smells like you just left the spa.</li>
            <li>My hair is super dry, the ends look horrible and it is full of static electricity all the time.</li>
            <li>Since I bleached my hair having soft hair has been hard to achieve without putting different heavy products in my already natural fine staight hair.</li>
            <li>It is not as dry or frizzy, and leaves my hair soft, silky and shiny.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I like to have my hair soft and shiny, but I like my hair blonde and being blonde leaves my hair dry and feeling like a wig sometimes.</li>
            <li>I flat iron it as often as I can as I found it tangles less when it is straight.</li>

            <li> The pump bottle is fantastic too.&lt;br /&gt;Majestical</li>
            <li> Argan Oil is all around fabulous.</li>
            <li> It is fabulous just like it comes.    </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always loved organ oil for this exact reason since it always seems to do such a great job keeping my hair very well moisturized.</li>
            <li> I was so excited how this product worked for</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m excited to continue using this to help keep it healthier.</li>
            <li> First of all, it comes in a pump dispenser which is so much more convenient than others that have the dropper dispensing system.  </li>
            <li> But so far I love it!  </li>
            <li> I got this at a special promo discount to try and test out.</li>
            <li> I love the Argan Oil, made styling much easier.</li>
            <li> I ordered this because I love the Argan lotion so much.</li>
            <li> Full of not water soluble CONS....</li>
            <li> It comes out thin which is perfect for putting into hair because it can spread so easily.</li>
            <li> Moroccan Argan Oil has helped my hair tremendously.</li>
            <li> I received a free sample of this product and really like it!</li>
            <li> I love coloring my hair a new shade almost every two months.</li>
            <li> I have super curly hair, lots of it, but fine, and this really seems to work.  </li>
            <li> I have dry fine hair and this stuff keeps it nice and shiny.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair shiny without looking oily and maintains my frizzy hair in hot humid weather!</li>
            <li> Lovely oil and made my hair super soft and shiny.  </li>
            <li> I use just a little bit from the roots to the ends of my hair and it makes my hair silky smooth, shiny and completely free from static electricity!</li>
            <li> Worth a try for the price point.</li>
            <li> I got it for a promotional price, but it wasn&#x27;t even worth that.</li>
            <li> Quickly absorbed.</li>
            <li> Worth purchasing.</li>
            <li> Argan oil for the hair will make your hair soft, shiny, manageable and healthy.</li>
            <li> worth messing your hair up.</li>
            <li> I use it in my hair to protect it from the heat of the blowdryer and also to tame fly way hair.</li>
            <li> Yeah right</li>
            <li> i received my Magestic Argan Oil a couple days ago and used it right away.</li>
            <li> It doesnt have a smell and leaves the skin smooth and hair looking brand new</li>
            <li> Hopefully, in a few more weeks, I will see some more hair growth as well.</li>
            <li> My hair was also left looking very silky and it has a nice smell to it.  </li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used it enough to really give an honest report.</li>
            <li> This is overall a great product, I would definitely purchase it again.</li>
            <li> I mix it in with my conditioner because I don&#x27;t like the smell of this product  very much.</li>
            <li> My dry colored hair is no longer under a hat or up in a pony tail, it is down and bouncy and wonderful!  </li>
            <li> Love the smell and am I definitely adding this to my hair care products and will be ordering it again!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping too!</li>
            <li> I only use this on my ends, but it does seem to keep them healthy and really seal in the moisture!</li>
            <li> Def recommend this product for those who are looking to bring life back to their hair:)</li>
            <li> I sprayed my hair first with leave in conditioner and then followed up with this oil.</li>
            <li> ( I have about 20-30 hair products) in my hair and this is the first one that helped with detangling and moisturizing.</li>
            <li> I fell in love with this product the instant it arrived.</li>
            <li> Great quality and pretty thick oil.</li>
            <li> Made my hair feel like silk first time I used it.</li>
            <li> The color is back to normal and my hair is soft and healthy looking once more.  </li>
            <li> This Oil has a different consistency then most of the Argon Oils out there.  </li>
            <li> Moroccan Argan Oil for hair has helped sooo much!</li>
            <li> I only wish it had a better scent.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> It was fun and exciting to try something new.</li>
            <li> It smells really nice and makes my hair super soft after I blow dry it or curl it.</li>
            <li> So far loving it, I lighten my hair regularly</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend this product for anyone who wants to give their hair some love.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a hair straightener addict, but I would never want my dependence on a flat iron to cause me to have anything less than perfectly touchable soft hair.</li>
            <li> My hair has been pretty much every color under the sun, which has wound up making my hair feel brittle and look frizzy.</li>
            <li> The only thing I like about this product is that it&#x27;s got a pump and it dispenses easily.</li>
            <li> This oil keeps my hair feeling super soft, and strong even with regular bleachings.</li>
            <li> Although it isn&#x27;t pure Argan oil, I would buy this again because of how well it goes on her hair.</li>
            <li> What a difference a few weeks make, I love this serum!</li>
            <li> It is the new staple in my hair care regiment and I will definitely purchase more when this is gone.  </li>
            <li> My hair was left feeling very silkly and easy to comb, and I may use this as a pre-treatment for straightening my hair</li>
            <li> It is good on hard todo hair</li>
            <li> My usually wild and frizzy hair is now soft, smooth, and manageable.</li>
            <li> Has left my hair smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li> This is a quality product that is very versatile.</li>
            <li> well they are just conditioning really well.  </li>
            <li> and this product really helped with the dryness of her hair....</li>
            <li> Fast ship, I thought it would make my hair oily, I used 2 pumps and it feels softer and shinier ,  not oily what so ever</li>
            <li> This went straight into the trash.</li>
            <li> I was losing hair so much</li>
            <li> haha.</li>
            <li> I have the type of hair that does whatever it wants to do.</li>
            <li> I had to use 3-4 pumps for my whole head.</li>
            <li> My hair is really curly</li>
            <li> I hope they go out of business real soon.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair smooth, I can feel the different.</li>
            <li> but it was really oily</li>
            <li> And thanks.</li>
            <li> YOU SO MUCH.</li>
            <li> my hair feels now so much softer and it gives my hair shine.</li>
            <li> It has the same smell and texture but so much better because it&#x27;s all natural.</li>
            <li> I have only been using this a short time, but already my hair is straightening so quickly and is smooth.  </li>
            <li> and like I said I have a ton of long, fine hair</li>
            <li> Love it, my hair is soft and long.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d rather just spend a little more and get the pure product, which is why I returned It.</li>
            <li> It tames the frizz and makes my hair smell fantastic all day long.  </li>
            <li> My hair was shinny than normal and it was much easier to style.</li>
            <li> I even tried the hot oil treatments you can buy at department stores, but nothing completely worked.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I live in an extreme climate where the temperatures are below zero for most of the winter.</li>
            <li> I put a little bit more on my hands (i have super thick hair) and used it on the top layer of hair as well.</li>
            <li> The argan oil is thicker than expected for an oil making it easy to apply because it stayed on my fingers</li>
            <li> The scent is over-powering and it&#x27;s a scent I associate with older gentlemen.</li>
            <li> they are high quality</li>
            <li> I got a high discount code, then I tried buy it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this if you have frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> This product was too highly scented for me.</li>
            <li> It is very strong smell and not appealing for women.</li>
            <li> I always brush my hair out in the morning but by evening, there are lots of little tangles and again when I wake up in the morning there are more tangles.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it only once so far - a drop &amp; 1/2 as a leave in conditioner on my clean damp hair...  </li>
            <li> My hair is soft shiny and very manageable.</li>
            <li> Naturally penetrates the hair to help moisturize each layer of the hair strand for long-term hair repair so your hair actually looks and feels healthier, silkier, and extraordinarily shiny.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Moroccan Argan Oil has helped my very dry ends and there has been a significant increase in breakage.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I bet when I apply it to my hair right after washing it will have the same effect and I am hoping add a bit of volume.</li>
            <li> This is more of a plain scent</li>
            <li> Love that it doesn&#x27;t have a heavy scent, and doesn&#x27;t weigh my (fine) hair down or make it look greasy.</li>
            <li> I immediately purchased a new bottle.</li>
            <li> Live what it&#x27;s done to my split ends</li>
            <li> Since argan is considered a dry oil, it absorbs quickly and is not greasy.</li>
            <li> Even after using very sparingly, it still left my hair very greasy, and I don&#x27;t have greasy hair.</li>
            <li> I have only recently discovered how fabulous argan oils are.  </li>
            <li> Some new hair products can leave my skin with an irriation rash as I am very sensitive, but this had no side effects what so ever.</li>
            <li> my hair has never felt so soft!</li>
            <li> My hair looks so much better: shinier and no more</li>
            <li> It was very straight and blindly always and was nice and shiny and soft.</li>
            <li> I received this argan oil serum in the mail today and I am so far very pleasantly surprised!</li>
            <li> Also, argon oil isn&#x27;t even the main ingredient, or even one of the main ingredients-it&#x27;s fourth on the list!</li>
            <li> My hair gets dry and hard to deal with sometimes, so this oil is perfect for helping tame my hair.</li>
            <li> frizzy(which was hard to believe) and it was shiny and looked healthy.</li>
            <li> So far I like the oil a lot, its not greasy.</li>
            <li> Wow</li>
            <li> My frizzy hair is now on controle for the forest tI&#x27;m in nearly 2 decades.</li>
            <li> It tames my hair from the humidity and leaves it soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> This oil worked very well on my daughter&#x27;s mixed textured hair.</li>
            <li> I have a sensitive nose.</li>
            <li> It made my hair so soft and shiny, with no frizz.</li>
            <li> This product makes my hair extremely soft.</li>
            <li> Definately controls frizz while leaving your hair soft.</li>
            <li> I applied a little more trying to distribute it evenly and flat ironed each section.</li>
            <li> My hair is long and extremely frizzy, it tangles easy</li>
            <li> My hair has been so dry and extremely frizzy, this has really calmed down the frizzy and feels shiny clean again!!</li>
            <li> I have a lottt of fine hair and usually oils make my hair appear greasy.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair super shiny and makes my hair less frizzy.</li>
            <li> but I later realized it had a bunch of polymers as the main ingredients (the argan is listed 4th).</li>
            <li> I have very frizzy hair and have tried many products to tame it down.</li>
            <li> Definitely needed something natural that would not give me any reactions and this is it!!</li>
            <li> My hair is always free from frizz after applying a small amount.</li>
            <li> I had a long hair , but I chopped it into jaw length because It was very damaged from bleach..</li>
            <li> I was even able to skip a pedi since my heels were so soft and not their usual dry, cracked selves.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t make our hair oily and we have curly, thick, and fine hair in our family.</li>
            <li> The issue with this Argan oil is that if you read the ingredients, there are many other things in the list and Argan oil is the 3rd or 4th down.</li>
            <li> The argan oil left my hair very soft, and not dry at the ends, and not with the  brittleness always causes it to break.</li>
            <li> I use it on my daughters naturally curly mixed hair and it tames her mane!</li>
            <li> My hair looks younger, feels healther, soft and supple.  </li>
            <li> The thing I love about this serum is that it&#x27;s thick, but still thin enough to feel like I can still spread it easily.</li>
            <li> This requires only a few drops to disperse in your hair and it absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> I normally let my hair air dry in a braid.</li>
            <li> But, after today when applying this oil to my dry hair my blonde hair looks shiny now and feels so soft and natural!</li>
            <li> I have tried to many different shampoos, conditioners, sprays and other hair care product to tame my hair and give it the softness and shine</li>
            <li> This one was by far the most affordable and worked just as well as expensive salon products.</li>
            <li> Serums I&#x27;ve used in the past have been so thick that I end up using way more than I really need to, but that is definitely not a problem with this one!</li>
            <li> I don’t really know how to describe the scent other than your hair smells like you just left the spa.</li>
            <li> My hair is super dry, the ends look horrible and it is full of static electricity all the time.</li>
            <li> Since I bleached my hair having soft hair has been hard to achieve without putting different heavy products in my already natural fine staight hair.</li>
            <li> It is not as dry or frizzy, and leaves my hair soft, silky and shiny.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I like to have my hair soft and shiny, but I like my hair blonde and being blonde leaves my hair dry and feeling like a wig sometimes.</li>
            <li> I flat iron it as often as I can as I found it tangles less when it is straight.</li>
            <li> Lately it&#x27;s been super dry.</li>
            <li> Leaves hair very shiny with no frizz just a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> so I simply put a couple pumps of oil in my hands and run it through my hair after drying and before curing or flat ironing.  </li>
            <li> Makes our hair soft without weighing it down and making it look sticky.</li>
            <li> this bottle will last a long time!</li>
            <li> my daughter did a new hair color with her hair that dried it out</li>
            <li> Bleach blonde hair tends to be very dry and brittle.</li>
            <li> have also used this in my dry hair before I use my flat iron</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my daughter who has long, color treated hair.  </li>
            <li> I use a dime size squirt of it and it has lasted me a long time.</li>
            <li> I have long hair</li>
            <li> Its not pure Argan oil which I thought it was (I didn&#x27;t read the ingredients properly which is my fault, but I wish the ingredients were in the description on not on the box label which I had to enlarge to see).</li>
            <li> I also really love the container and packaging - it just makes it feel so regal and expensive!</li>
            <li> : Just a pump or two of this product goes a long way!</li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t make hair greasy when you add some touch ups on dry hair.</li>
            <li> Then I proceeded to blow dry my hair.</li>
            <li> I applied it to my already dry hair.</li>
            <li> It adds moisture and shine to my frizzy and dry hair.</li>
            <li> and after I blow dry and style.</li>
            <li> My hair is slightly dry its not oily.</li>
            <li> Before using this argan oil, I had dry, frizzy and unmanageable hair.</li>
            <li> so it tenfs to get extremely dry.  </li>
            <li> dry .not</li>
            <li> And, my little fly away hairs are tamed down and no looking crazy!</li>
            <li> The scent of this product is overwhelming and, to me, unpleasant.</li>
            <li> Would recommend &amp; buy again when it runs out--which won&#x27;t be for awhile considering I only need a half pump</li>
            <li> my skin has gotten so dry, my hands would just feel so rough, but not anymore, the Moroccan Argon Oil I put in my hair has helped with my dry winter hands as well!</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair that its very wavy and frizzy.</li>
            <li> It is very thick and it doesn&#x27;t take much.</li>
            <li> I apply it to my hair when it&#x27;s still damp but not dropping wet.</li>
            <li> For me,  I apply it when it&#x27;s wet</li>
            <li> I washed and dried my hair, followed the directions and applied it as a deep steamer treatment.</li>
            <li> then I expected.</li>
            <li> I have only been using this for a few weeks.</li>
            <li> Sorry for my late review I had to use it many time</li>
            <li> Makes my hair soft, but does have a weird old lady smell.</li>
            <li> I use it on damp hair prior to drying and after flat ironing to tame a few flyaways.  </li>
            <li> There is absolutely no reason argon oil would need dyes or any of the other additives.</li>
            <li> and I am always using a flat iron on my hair, which has dried it out.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> It also has red and yellow dye in it which is not good for your hair.</li>
            <li> Little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way and baby...</li>
            <li> I received this the other day.</li>
            <li> But it means nothing when I can&#x27;t get past the scent to actually use it on my hair.</li>
            <li> I extremely recommend this product</li>
            <li> I usually add essential oils to argan oils</li>
            <li> Does not make hair greasy like a lot of the other oils</li>
            <li> A little goes a very long way so you can use it sparingly.</li>
            <li> No odor and does add mousture without weighing my hair down.</li>
            <li> So I read the directions and since my hair was already dry, I put  a small pump onto my hand, rubbed my hands together and then went for my roots.</li>
            <li> It is winter here in Indiana and my hair is a frizzy mess after blow drying.  </li>
            <li> I applied just a little to my hair before blow drying it and could see a difference in the feel of my hair.</li>
            <li> Have been telling and sharing with everyone I know (just a little bit</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t even a little bit greasy on her hair</li>
            <li> I have a few friends who use this for there hair.</li>
            <li> This is why I heavily condition.</li>
            <li> Once I had it blow dried</li>
            <li> Not as heavy as some.</li>
            <li> so I can pump a few drops onto my fingers.</li>
            <li> And it isn&#x27;t heavy on my hair.</li>
            <li> Dont waste money on this product.</li>
            <li> Unless you use a harsh shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;And to return this was a nightmare.  </li>
            <li> but, it comes in a small glass bottle.</li>
            <li> :/</li>
            <li> but I couldn&#x27;t get past the scent.</li>
            <li> and it made my hair straighter than it usually does</li>
            <li> No more fighting with my comb to get the knots and tangles out of my hair!&lt;br /&gt;Tip</li>
            <li> Its lightweight and gives crazy shine when I apply to wet hair and blow dry.</li>
            <li> My hair seems to be frizzy a lot here lately.</li>
            <li> I have thick curly hair and it tends to get a bit frizzy after a color process.</li>
            <li> I have thick hair that is somewhat frizzy</li>
            <li> If I use a drop too much, my hair is oily and I hate that!&lt;br</li>
            <li> (Mom black and dad is Hispanic) and tends to tangle badly and run on the dry side.</li>
            <li> That doesn&#x27;t mean it will not work for you.</li>
            <li> Ive seriously bought dozens of argan oils for my hair.</li>
            <li> This product is very thick.  </li>
            <li> It is very thick.  </li>

            <li> I was wrong</li>
            <li> and it proved that I was wrong.</li>

            <li> Received this via promotion to try...love it! It smells great and works fantastic...I use it on my daughters naturally curly mixed hair and it tames her mane! Love the smell and am I definitely adding this to my hair care products and will be ordering it again!</li>
            <li> Ive seriously bought dozens of argan oils for my hair. The others would leave my hair oily and dirty looking. With this brand ive never had that problem. My hair looks and feels amazing. I get compliments all the time. I have this argan oil to thank for my healthy amazing looking hair.</li>
            <li> Has left my hair smooth and shiny. Great product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many Argan Oils and this ranks up there with one of the best. It has a luxurious scent. The pump and stylish bottle are an added bonus. I use it after every shower to my hair, hands, and feet. My hair is always free from frizz after applying a small amount. My cuticles are supple and healthy looking. I am a &amp;#34;picker&amp;#34; and if my cuticles are dry I chew and pick until they look horrible. With Best Argan Oil Serum I was able to pick at bigger issues at hand. My nail technician even commented on how much better my hands look. I was even able to skip a pedi since my heels were so soft and not their usual dry, cracked selves. This is a quality product that is very versatile. Its a must for any girl!</li>
            <li> Fantastic stuff! Smells amazing and makes my hair like silk. I&#x27;ve tried many and this one is the best so far. I love the glass bottle with pump dispenser too. Great product!</li>
            <li> Very good customer service. Product arrived in time and well packed. So far I like the oil a lot, its not greasy. Worth a try for the price point.</li>
            <li> Works great ~~~ My hair has never been better ---- A &amp;#34;Must Have&amp;#34; for your beauty arsenal! Fast shipping too!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a hair straightener addict, but I would never want my dependence on a flat iron to cause me to have anything less than perfectly touchable soft hair. I&#x27;ve always loved organ oil for this exact reason since it always seems to do such a great job keeping my hair very well moisturized. This argan oil serum definitely lives up to the expectation. I also really love the container and packaging - it just makes it feel so regal and expensive! The thing I love about this serum is that it&#x27;s thick, but still thin enough to feel like I can still spread it easily. Serums I&#x27;ve used in the past have been so thick that I end up using way more than I really need to, but that is definitely not a problem with this one! I only use this on my ends, but it does seem to keep them healthy and really seal in the moisture!</li>
            <li> I love this product! I add it to my homemade shampoo!</li>
            <li> I received this the other day. I have a few friends who use this for there hair. I thought Yeah right this works that well they are just conditioning really well.  I found I could get this under a great promotional rate and I thought what the heck I can do that and if I dont like it what am I out?Now I want to share my experience with everyone with the same issues I have with my hair.  So once it came I had to try it. Wow what a difference. I was wrong it is the Argon oil. So glad I tried this and it proved that I was wrong. Love it. My hair is soft shiny and very manageable. My hair when it dries out tangles so easily. This is why I heavily condition. This is really awesome! I have shared this with famly and friends and now i want everyone else to know how good this product is. Once this is out I plan on purchasing more.</li>
            <li> AWESOME!  My hair is silky and smooth! Forget frizz...haven&#x27;t  had a problem  since I started  use this.  Now my daughter is hooked!!!&lt;br /&gt;☆☆☆☆☆</li>
            <li> I am very happy with the product but, it comes in a small glass bottle. I found that out when it fell into the shower and broke in the tub. Oil was everywhere and glass cut my foot. It took a while to get the greasy oil and shards of glass up. I will keep it out of the shower with the next bottle.</li>
            <li> Remember Cousin It From the Adam&#x27;s Family? Sometimes I think I could pass for that frizzy haired cousin. My hair is long and extremely frizzy, it tangles easy and I have to stay on it or the tangles get unmanageable. I flat iron it as often as I can as I found it tangles less when it is straight. I got the Moroccan Argan Oil for Hair at an awesome price and was excited to share my experience. I applied just a little to my hair before blow drying it and could see a difference in the feel of my hair. Once I had it blow dried I applied a little more trying to distribute it evenly and flat ironed each section. My hair was shinny than normal and it was much easier to style. I love the Argan Oil, made styling much easier.</li>
            <li> this works wonders ...my daughter did a new hair color with her hair that dried it out and this product really helped with the dryness of her hair....she was happy thanks</li>
            <li> Amazing oil!  As a former hairdresser I can honestly say that this product is one of the best on the market.  The smell is fabulous, the consistency is silky smooth, and it leaves my hair looking lustrous.  I use it on damp hair prior to drying and after flat ironing to tame a few flyaways.  Love it!</li>
            <li> It seemed to work ok, but the smell reminds me of something a man should be wearing. It is very strong smell and not appealing for women.</li>
            <li> My frizzy hair is now on controle for the forest tI&#x27;m in nearly 2 decades.</li>
            <li> It Stinks really bad. If you don&#x27;t want your hair to stink by hugging someone or getting it on your pillowcase, just wear it at home if your not going anywhere then wash it off. :/</li>
            <li> I love love this product and will buy again. Makes my hair shiny without looking oily and maintains my frizzy hair in hot humid weather!</li>
            <li> Fast ship, I thought it would make my hair oily, I used 2 pumps and it feels softer and shinier ,  not oily what so ever and it smells amazing .</li>
            <li> It does wonders for my hair! I mix it in with my conditioner because I don&#x27;t like the smell of this product  very much. It smells a bit musky. Almost like it&#x27;s a male scent.</li>
            <li> Hair and skin have seen a big difference. Love this Argan Oil Serum</li>
            <li> I love it!! I will be buying again this month</li>
            <li> Since argan is considered a dry oil, it absorbs quickly and is not greasy. Naturally penetrates the hair to help moisturize each layer of the hair strand for long-term hair repair so your hair actually looks and feels healthier, silkier, and extraordinarily shiny. Argan Oil is a superior source of antioxidants, vitamin E, and moisture as it nourishes and protects skin and hair from the environment.</li>
            <li> I have only been using this a short time, but already my hair is straightening so quickly and is smooth.  I have super curly hair, lots of it, but fine, and this really seems to work.  Hopefully, in a few more weeks, I will see some more hair growth as well.</li>
            <li> This is such a great Product! It is light and not greasy. My hair also feels stronger and healthier since I&#x27;ve been using it!</li>
            <li> This is not &#x27;argon oil&#x27;, this is &#x27;argon oil with a ton of nasty additives&#x27;. There is absolutely no reason argon oil would need dyes or any of the other additives. Also, argon oil isn&#x27;t even the main ingredient, or even one of the main ingredients-it&#x27;s fourth on the list! This went straight into the trash. Thank goodness I got it for a promotional price, but it wasn&#x27;t even worth that.</li>
            <li> I love this product. My usually wild and frizzy hair is now soft, smooth, and manageable.</li>
            <li> Love it, my hair is soft and long.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my daughter who has long, color treated hair.  The Argan oil gives her hair a beautiful shine and softness.  Love it!</li>
            <li> When I do my hair I have to use nice shampoo and some sort of serum to straighten my hair. It was fun and exciting to try something new. My hair turned it great. It was very straight and blindly always and was nice and shiny and soft. Argon oil is some good stuff.</li>
            <li> Love the magic this works on my hair. My hair has been processed so many times to the point that I have lost track. I love coloring my hair a new shade almost every two months. Lately it&#x27;s been super dry. I tried this product and loved it. It smells really nice and makes my hair super soft after I blow dry it or curl it. Def recommend this product for those who are looking to bring life back to their hair:)</li>
            <li> This serum reminds of Chi silk fusion. serum. It has the same smell and texture but so much better because it&#x27;s all natural. It tames my hair from the humidity and leaves it soft and shiny. I absolutely love it!!</li>
            <li> This oil worked very well on my daughter&#x27;s mixed textured hair.</li>
            <li> Nothing is better than argan oil for hair and skin.</li>
            <li> My hair has never felt better</li>
            <li> I have thick curly hair and it tends to get a bit frizzy after a color process. This oil is great to repair my split ends and to add shine to my hair.&lt;br /&gt;The smell isn&#x27;t heavy at alll !!! Itdoesn&#x27;t bother me .. and let me tell u I have a sensitive nose. Overall its a great product. I will keep repurchasing!</li>
            <li> This works perfectly for smoothing hair and making it soft and manageable. Love that it doesn&#x27;t have a heavy scent, and doesn&#x27;t weigh my (fine) hair down or make it look greasy.</li>
            <li> Sorry for my late review I had to use it many time so I will find out what&#x27;s effect on me..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s the thing I can share to those looking a product similarity of this or ..&lt;br /&gt;This one is great product me its Increases my hair strength and speeds growth  I was losing hair so much and they don&#x27;t grow after..&lt;br /&gt;But since i tried this ARGAN OIL just amazing solution.</li>
            <li> It is good on hard todo hair</li>
            <li> I have a lottt of fine hair and usually oils make my hair appear greasy. However, this stuff is the BEST! Its lightweight and gives crazy shine when I apply to wet hair and blow dry. It also doesn&#x27;t make hair greasy when you add some touch ups on dry hair. Would recommend &amp; buy again when it runs out--which won&#x27;t be for awhile considering I only need a half pump and like I said I have a ton of long, fine hair haha.</li>
            <li> I am always looking for things that make managing my hair easier and this argan oil definitely does the trick.  I always brush my hair out in the morning but by evening, there are lots of little tangles and again when I wake up in the morning there are more tangles.  It is an ongoing thing and sometimes they can be quite difficult to brush out.  I applied this argan oil in the morning from the roots to the ends as directed and I cannot believe how easy my hair was to brush.  My hair was also left looking very silky and it has a nice smell to it.  It comes in a nice pump bottle for easy use.  The argan oil is thicker than expected for an oil making it easy to apply because it stayed on my fingers so I could apply it instead of running all over the place.  I am so glad I was able to participate in this promo and provide my honest opinion.  This is definitely a five star product.</li>
            <li> I have the type of hair that does whatever it wants to do.I have used different types of products on my hair but still it doesn&#x27;t look like I want it to.&lt;br /&gt;I was given the opportunity to try this argon oil during a promotional period and I would like to share with you how it affected my hair.&lt;br /&gt; I have never used this type of oil before on my hair.My hair seems to be frizzy a lot here lately.After washing my hair I applied about 2-3 pumps in my hands and massaged it throughout my hair.I left in as a leave conditioner.Then I proceeded to blow dry my hair. I have to say that my hair was not frizzy(which was hard to believe) and it was shiny and looked healthy.I was so excited how this product worked for me.&lt;br /&gt; You can use it as a conditioner, it helps as a heat protector while using styling tools.It leaves that great shine to you hair also. I would definitely purchase this product.</li>
            <li> Love Argan oil for both myself and my oldest son. Makes our hair soft without weighing it down and making it look sticky. Smells great too. Not all girly smelling so my son actually lets me use it on him 👍</li>
            <li> I love it! Non greasy and has a pleasant smell.</li>
            <li> I received this argan oil serum in the mail today and I am so far very pleasantly surprised! I applied it to my already dry hair. I had already planned on using it for daily use as I have bleach blonde hair. Bleach blonde hair tends to be very dry and brittle. I like to have my hair soft and shiny, but I like my hair blonde and being blonde leaves my hair dry and feeling like a wig sometimes. Since I bleached my hair having soft hair has been hard to achieve without putting different heavy products in my already natural fine staight hair. But, after today when applying this oil to my dry hair my blonde hair looks shiny now and feels so soft and natural! I bet when I apply it to my hair right after washing it will have the same effect and I am hoping add a bit of volume. I am also hoping it will help with hair growth, I am growing my hair out from a short crop cut. I will see and update this review. But so far I love it!  Smells great, is not heavy on my hair, adds shine to dry hair, and the bottle is cute with a good size amount. I give this an A+++!!</li>
            <li> I have ordered several of these. they are high quality and i Love how many ways i can use it too</li>
            <li> Keeps hair fritz free</li>
            <li> I use this in my hair after getting out of the shower.  I sprayed my hair first with leave in conditioner and then followed up with this oil. I had to use 3-4 pumps for my whole head. My hair is really curly (Mom black and dad is Hispanic) and tends to tangle badly and run on the dry side. I normally let my hair air dry in a braid. the next day I release the braids and my hair is curly. I then detangled my hair. The oil made it easy to detangle. I&#x27;m so happy with my hair.  I&#x27;ve tried a bunch of different oils ( I have about 20-30 hair products) in my hair and this is the first one that helped with detangling and moisturizing. I immediately purchased a new bottle. The oil feels nice in the hair and it smells good.  Not strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 26 Aug 2015///I&#x27;m so glad I purchased 3 more bottles of this stuff.  I tried to order some more and Amazon is out of the product.  Just as I found found a product that agrees with my hair...I no longer can find the oil on Amazon.  Amazon folks---please please please get some more of this product.  My hair will love you. I tried looking on line elsewhere for this product, the closest I came was to Sear. They are selling the stuff for $24 per bottle and the shipping cost is $20. Sears can kiss my grits.  I hope they go out of business real soon. They have always overcharged for their crap.  AMAZON please head my plea.  Get this stuff back in the store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;14 Jan 2017; please please please stock this hair product. I cant believe Amazon is out of this product.</li>
            <li> Got this for promotional value to try and review, but I can&#x27;t use it. The scent is over-powering and it&#x27;s a scent I associate with older gentlemen. I tried to use it on my hair but I couldn&#x27;t get past the scent. Also, I was under the impression that this is 100% Argan oil, which it is not. The only thing I like about this product is that it&#x27;s got a pump and it dispenses easily. But it means nothing when I can&#x27;t get past the scent to actually use it on my hair.</li>
            <li> Great on my hair. Its not pure Argan oil which I thought it was (I didn&#x27;t read the ingredients properly which is my fault, but I wish the ingredients were in the description on not on the box label which I had to enlarge to see). Nonetheless still feels and smells very nice.</li>
            <li> Smells great and leaves my hair very soft and easy to manage! My hair gets dry and hard to deal with sometimes, so this oil is perfect for helping tame my hair. I apply it to my hair when it&#x27;s still damp but not dropping wet. Great stuff!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been putting this on my hair and it has helped with the dryness.  Leaves hair shiny and smoother.</li>
            <li> I have dry fine hair and this stuff keeps it nice and shiny. Smells great too.</li>
            <li> This product is very thick.  I use it on my scalp and skin.  Thank you.  Unfortunately the bottle fell and broke.  I will order again.</li>
            <li> I have only used once but I really liked it when I used it.</li>
            <li> I love it. I got a high discount code, then I tried buy it. After used it, I become more and more like it. It makes my hair smooth, I can feel the different.</li>
            <li> This argan oil smells good and I like that it is a pump bottle. It adds moisture and shine to my frizzy and dry hair. I also put it on my daughter&#x27;s hair to help with tangles.  For me,  I apply it when it&#x27;s wet and after I blow dry and style. My hair looks moisturized and not greasy.</li>
            <li> I fell in love with this product the instant it arrived. Not only was the bottle gorgeous, making me feel fancy, but the product inside is amazing. It smells great and my hair soaked it up, leaving it feeling so soft and healthy. I bleach my hair on a regular basis so I&#x27;m excited to continue using this to help keep it healthier. Have been telling and sharing with everyone I know (just a little bit so they get an idea bc I don&#x27;t want everyone using it all up) lol.</li>
            <li> I received a free sample of this product and really like it! There are several ways to use it, but I use it after I&#x27;ve washed my hair, I rub it on the ends of my hair. I use a dime size squirt of it and it has lasted me a long time.</li>
            <li> Leaves hair very shiny with no frizz just a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Lovely oil and made my hair super soft and shiny.  Great quality and pretty thick oil.</li>
            <li> this is the best stuff for my hair</li>
            <li> I tend to have dry,frizzy hair, so thought this would be perfect for me. Item arrived in a padded envelope, and was in perfect condition when I opened package. I always like to smell things before using, and this had a very pleasant smell. I washed and dried my hair, followed the directions and applied it as a deep steamer treatment. The argan oil left my hair very soft, and not dry at the ends, and not with the  brittleness always causes it to break.I recieved this as part of  promo for providing my honest  and unbiased opinion. Some new hair products can leave my skin with an irriation rash as I am very sensitive, but this had no side effects what so ever. My hair was left feeling very silkly and easy to comb, and I may use this as a pre-treatment for straightening my hair</li>
            <li> My hair is super fine and has never been as crazy as it is since moving to Florida!  I have tried so many things for the frizz. This product is okay for me but if I use too much it weighs heavy on my hair. That doesn&#x27;t mean it will not work for you. I however, will not purchase again.</li>
            <li> Love my Argan Oil Serum!  My hair looks younger, feels healther, soft and supple.  My dry colored hair is no longer under a hat or up in a pony tail, it is down and bouncy and wonderful!  What a difference a few weeks make, I love this serum!</li>
            <li> Fantastic product- how did I survive without it?  I use it on my hair and my daughter&#x27;s.  Doesn&#x27;t make our hair oily and we have curly, thick, and fine hair in our family.</li>
            <li> I love the way this oil make my skin feel.</li>
            <li> This works fantastically! I have very frizzy hair and have tried many products to tame it down. This one was by far the most affordable and worked just as well as expensive salon products. I highly recommend this if you have frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> Quickly absorbed. You only need a tiny bit, so this will last a loong time. I like the fragrance a lot, it reminds me of perfume. Not a floral perfume, like a Chanel perfume. Just FYI, some people have issues with fragrance. It made my hair so soft and shiny, with no frizz. Yet didn&#x27;t make my hair oily.</li>
            <li> This product makes my hair extremely soft. I am very happy with this product. It makes my hair super shiny and makes my hair less frizzy. I extremely recommend this product</li>
            <li> This oil is awesome for any hair type. Myself and my husband use it. I also use it in my childrens hair. I bleach my hair often as well as a ton of heating products I use on my hair. This oil keeps my hair feeling super soft, and strong even with regular bleachings.</li>
            <li> I just got my argan oil a couple of days ago and I&#x27;ve already noticed a difference. My hair feels softer! A little goes a very long way so you can use it sparingly. I used it with my flatiron and it made my hair straighter than it usually does when I just use the flatiron so they get rave reviews from me on that! Also, it has a pleasant smell that didn&#x27;t overpower the shampoo and conditioner I used. It also gave me hair a very nice shine which is great because sometimes my hair looks dull to me and this took care of that!</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used it enough to really give an honest report.</li>
            <li> Not as heavy as some. No odor and does add mousture without weighing my hair down. I only use it on the roots so it works for me.</li>
            <li> I have thick hair that is somewhat frizzy and I am always using a flat iron on my hair, which has dried it out.&lt;br /&gt;This Moroccan Argan Oil has helped my hair tremendously. It is not as dry or frizzy, and leaves my hair soft, silky and shiny.&lt;br /&gt;Moroccan Argan Oil has helped my very dry ends and there has been a significant increase in breakage.&lt;br /&gt;I use a fee drops on my hair after washing it, it does not leave my hair oily or greasy looking, but leaves it with a wonderful silky soft feel and very shiny and healthy looking.&lt;br /&gt;I have also used this in my dry hair before I use my flat iron and it smells wonderful. The pump bottle is fantastic too.&lt;br /&gt;Majestical Argan Oil is all around fabulous. I have even used it on my face as a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Wow am so glad I was given the opportunity to try this!! Been using it daily and such a big difference!! I never tried but my hair was in desperate need of help!! Definitely needed something natural that would not give me any reactions and this is it!! In exchange my honest opinion is it is the best!! My hair has been so dry and extremely frizzy, this has really calmed down the frizzy and feels shiny clean again!! Definitely will be continuing this daily, no bad smells, leaves great feeling and works wonderful on my hair!! Especially great for anyone my age that dyes their hair as much as I do, The gray will no longer win, I can continue with dyes without killing my hair!! Truly &amp;#34;Liquid Gold&amp;#34;!!!</li>
            <li> Live what it&#x27;s done to my split ends</li>
            <li> Best argan oil I&#x27;ve used. My hair looks and feels amazing. Worth purchasing.</li>
            <li> This product was kind of nice but it was really oily it got all over my hands</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how it works yet; just received it. But HELP! I don&#x27;t know how to get the dispenser pump open so I can pump a few drops onto my fingers. I&#x27;m having to unscrew the cap and touch my fingers to the tube of the pump, which could eventually introduce bacteria into the fluid. Can anyone there HELP ME WITH HOW TO TURN/OPEN THE DISPENSER PUMP????? And thanks.</li>
            <li> The scent of this product is overwhelming and, to me, unpleasant. I can&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li> Puts a shine to my dry-looking permed hair and it might be my imagination, but my hair feels thicker since I&#x27;ve started using it.  I ordered this because I love the Argan lotion so much.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t think my bleached and destroyed hair was salvageable. This stuff saved my head.</li>
            <li> Made my hair feel like silk first time I used it. can&#x27;t wait to see it repair the damage!</li>
            <li> This product was too highly scented for me. It had more unnatural ingredients then I expected. I gave it to a friend and she likes it.</li>
            <li> I tried it for a while and it seemed fine, but I later realized it had a bunch of polymers as the main ingredients (the argan is listed 4th). Plus it has artificial colors and it&#x27;s made in China. I&#x27;d rather just spend a little more and get the pure product, which is why I returned It.</li>
            <li> I thought a &amp;#34;bad perm&amp;#34; had ruined my hair.  I saw this product on Amazon and ordered it.  I&#x27;ve used it only once so far - a drop &amp; 1/2 as a leave in conditioner on my clean damp hair...  After air drying my hair - it has been transformed.  The color is back to normal and my hair is soft and healthy looking once more.  I am sold on this product.  It also is great on my skin and nails.  If you are suffering from dry frizzy hair, please give this a try - you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> I am very happy with the results after using daily.&lt;br /&gt;Fr. Jude, S.J.P.</li>
            <li> Yuck! Even after using very sparingly, it still left my hair very greasy, and I don&#x27;t have greasy hair.</li>
            <li> I have only been using this for a few weeks. I use it on my skin as a moisturizer along with Rosemary Essential Oil and the C Essential Oil. It has made a great change for the better in the texture and tone of my skin. I use it in my hair to protect it from the heat of the blowdryer and also to tame fly way hair. you only need a tiny bit.</li>
            <li> Argan oil for the hair will make your hair soft, shiny, manageable and healthy. This requires only a few drops to disperse in your hair and it absorbs quickly. Once you go argan, you will use it often. It promotes hair growth and makes your hair healthier. This is a wonderful product and I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> I love this oil! It smells so good! And it isn&#x27;t heavy on my hair. LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> This serum works like magic! my hair has never felt so soft!</li>
            <li> My hair has never looked better</li>
            <li> This is amazing. I have very thick hair that its very wavy and frizzy. My hair is slightly dry its not oily. This serum makes my hair managable and mind. It&#x27;s so awesome for my hair.</li>
            <li> nice product. i like the smell</li>
            <li> I tried this at the recommendation of a friend.  I&#x27;ve used it once and am pleased with it.</li>
            <li> Dont waste money on this product. Sticky oil. I would not recommend it.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best leave in conditioner one could use, smells great does not weigh your hair down and it smells awesome!&lt;br /&gt;Tom&#x60;s wife</li>
            <li> Smells wonderful. Gives softness,  shine,  and manageability to my hair. Will purchase this item again.</li>
            <li> Oh my goodness, Moroccan Argan oil is simply amazing! Before using this argan oil, I had dry, frizzy and unmanageable hair. I have tried to many different shampoos, conditioners, sprays and other hair care product to tame my hair and give it the softness and shine I wanted. I even tried the hot oil treatments you can buy at department stores, but nothing completely worked.&lt;br /&gt;I found Moroccan Argan Oil at a great price and decided to give it a whirl. I have been using this argan oil for almost a week now. My hair looks so much better: shinier and no more frizz! Unlike before, combing my hair isn&#x27;t a chore. No more fighting with my comb to get the knots and tangles out of my hair!&lt;br /&gt;Tip: Just a pump or two of this product goes a long way! After washing your hair, massage the oil with your fingertips from root to tip. Comb it through to make sure it&#x27;s evenly distributed.</li>
            <li> I have only recently discovered how fabulous argan oils are.  I have tried several and have come to this conclusion:  this is the mother of all argan oils!  First of all, it comes in a pump dispenser which is so much more convenient than others that have the dropper dispensing system.  And the aroma.  I cannot put into words how wonderful this product smells.  I usually add essential oils to argan oils as they either have no smell or have a smell that is not too pleasant.  No need to do anything with this Majesticel Argan Oil.  It is fabulous just like it comes.    It is winter here in Indiana and my hair is a frizzy mess after blow drying.  I have long hair so I simply put a couple pumps of oil in my hands and run it through my hair after drying and before curing or flat ironing.  It tames the frizz and makes my hair smell fantastic all day long.  My hair is sleek and shiny and feel silky.  I am so glad I was given the opportunity to test this argan oil for quality during a promotional period and share how great my experience has been with others.  It is the new staple in my hair care regiment and I will definitely purchase more when this is gone.  You will not be disappointed if you choose this product.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair soft, but does have a weird old lady smell. The smell does go away in an hour or so.</li>
            <li> Used this product for 1 week.  So far loving it, I lighten my hair regularly so it tenfs to get extremely dry.  1 or 2 pumps on damp hair is all I need.  Does not make hair greasy like a lot of the other oils do.  It also smells fabulos and is a huge bottle.</li>
            <li> The issue with this Argan oil is that if you read the ingredients, there are many other things in the list and Argan oil is the 3rd or 4th down. It also has red and yellow dye in it which is not good for your hair. The smell is not so pleasant either. I think getting 100% argan oil makes a lot more sense and is much better for your hair.</li>
            <li> I love Argan oil an any chance I get I will try to order it. It doesnt have a smell and leaves the skin smooth and hair looking brand new</li>
            <li> Very great product I put it in my hair before I blow dry gets rid of frizzy hair!</li>
            <li> Feels good in my hair. Smells nice too!</li>
            <li> hair has stopped receading and its been a month</li>
            <li> This Oil is amazing!  I have used Argon Oil before, but I have never used this kind or used it as conditioner.  This Oil has a different consistency then most of the Argon Oils out there.  It is very thick.  I happen to run out of condition, and was a bit fearful of using this, because I have to be very careful with using Oil in my hair.  If I use a drop too much, my hair is oily and I hate that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was perfect.  It not only did not leave my hair oily, but worked as a conditioner! I will definitely be buying this again!</li>
            <li> Smells like heaven. It doesn&#x27;t make my hair look oily which is great.</li>
            <li> IT IS DEFINITELY THE BEST OIL TREATMENT FOR HAIR!! STRONGLY RECOMMEND IT !!!</li>
            <li> i received my Magestic Argan Oil a couple days ago and used it right away. My hair stylist has been urging me to get Argan Oil  to use on my hair. When I was offered this Argan Oil to try at a great deal and share my honest opinion about it, I couldn&#x27;t refuse. So I read the directions and since my hair was already dry, I put  a small pump onto my hand, rubbed my hands together and then went for my roots. I put a little bit more on my hands (i have super thick hair) and used it on the top layer of hair as well. to my surprise, my hair wasn&#x27;t all greasy and oily! And, my little fly away hairs are tamed down and no looking crazy! I definitely recommend this product for anyone who wants to give their hair some love.</li>
            <li> Love this for my hair. Little goes a long way. Love the smell too!</li>
            <li> Definately controls frizz while leaving your hair soft.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way and baby... this bottle will last a long time! :) My hair has been pretty much every color under the sun, which has wound up making my hair feel brittle and look frizzy. Moroccan Argan Oil for hair has helped sooo much! My hair looks hydrated and healthy! Helps keep my hair protected while I straighten it! I freakin love this stuff! It has helped so much especially with frizz! I even started to notice my hands becoming softer after using the Moroccan Argon Oil for my hair (gotta put the oil in somehow! so of course it would get on my hands!)&lt;br /&gt;Its still *ugh..* winter and my skin has gotten so dry, my hands would just feel so rough, but not anymore, the Moroccan Argon Oil I put in my hair has helped with my dry winter hands as well! 2 thumbs..WAYYY wayy up! :)</li>
            <li> I use this on my hair every time I wash it. It is very thick and it doesn&#x27;t take much. I only wish it had a better scent. I like my hair to have a floral or Girly smell. This is more of a plain scent but, it does the job and I love the pump. I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE YOU SO MUCH.</li>
            <li> Full of not water soluble CONS....LIKE SILICON.&lt;br /&gt;another words they WANT WASH OUT. Unless you use a harsh shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;And to return this was a nightmare.  Thank God amazon had my back.&lt;br /&gt;It absorbs into your hair leaves your hair great but after a while it well coat your hair not allowing moisture in. Need I say crack break dry .not worth messing your hair up.</li>
            <li> very good my hair is much better after using this product</li>
            <li> I had a long hair , but I chopped it into jaw length because It was very damaged from bleach..And since I started using this Moroccan argon oil &#x27; my hair feels now so much softer and it gives my hair shine. Love this product !!! Highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> I live in an extreme climate where the temperatures are below zero for most of the winter. With that said you can about imagine what that type of weather does to my hair, skin and nails. My hair is super dry, the ends look horrible and it is full of static electricity all the time. I was elated to be able to get this product at a promotional price and be able to share my experience with it here with you because it did wonders for my hair, skin and nails! I was so happy to find a product that works, not just claim to work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Majesticel Argan Oil arrived in a really attractive box. The color was beautiful. The product itself smells wonderful. I don’t really know how to describe the scent other than your hair smells like you just left the spa. I use just a little bit from the roots to the ends of my hair and it makes my hair silky smooth, shiny and completely free from static electricity! I also rub this into my hands, feet, and elbows at night before bed. I’ve also used this product for my cuticles. Its works great for that as well! This is overall a great product, I would definitely purchase it again. This product would also make a great gift idea for Mother’s Day coming up, a teacher gift or a Birthday gift.</li>
            <li> I use this stuff on my daughters hair and it works great! Although it isn&#x27;t pure Argan oil, I would buy this again because of how well it goes on her hair. When I&#x27;ve finished growing out my own hair, I can&#x27;t wait to use it on mine too. It isn&#x27;t even a little bit greasy on her hair yet it give her hair moisture and shine like nothing else. It has a pleasant smell. It comes out thin which is perfect for putting into hair because it can spread so easily. I got this at a special promo discount to try and test out. I would definitely recommend this to anyone. This is a great hair leave in treatment and I cant wait to use it on my own hair.</li>
