            <li>The lavender before bed is an added bonus for a good night sleep.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This really is a good product.</li>
            <li>It makes good bubbles but does not contribute to skin moisturizing.</li>

            <li>It wasn&#x27;t a huge deal, and it smells great, but i haven&#x27;t used it.</li>
            <li>This bubble bath is amazing.</li>
            <li>Really nice a body wash too.</li>
            <li>It is a really nice combination.  </li>
            <li>And of course the aroma is wonderful and helps create a very relaxing experience.  </li>
            <li>The smell is nice and not overpowering.  </li>
            <li>Foams up nicely, smells great and creates a very relaxing bath.  </li>
            <li>Great smell and lots of bubbles, was very happy with the product, wish bubbles would last longer, but overall, very nice product.</li>
            <li>Most bath bubbles suck, but this one takes one cap-full and it fills my entire bathtub with a wonderful lavender aroma.</li>
            <li>and I love it.  </li>
            <li>I honestly love this stuff makes my bath time my spa time.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I was able to find this at Amazon.</li>
            <li>one more thing ...</li>
            <li>Having it there makes me think I should rinse off real good afterward for the fear that if I don&#x27;t I might start smelling like cheese later on.  </li>
            <li>It might be an OK shower scrub, but that&#x27;s not why I bought it</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I found it on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I love baths and bubble baths.  </li>
            <li>But it generates some nice bubbles and also makes my skin feel smooth.  </li>
            <li>Based on the name of this, I am sure you can guess it&#x27;s quite a relaxing mixture.</li>
            <li>Goodness I love this product.</li>
            <li>My skin feels lovely after each use.</li>
            <li>I love the bath salt as well.</li>
            <li>4.5 stars would be better...</li>
            <li>I love</li>
            <li>I bought this for my daughter hoping it wouldn&#x27;t react with her eczema (since most bubble baths do).</li>
            <li>i thebath, relaxing, i am glad i got it</li>
            <li>Came without  seal on the top when unscrewed..</li>
            <li>Been using this bath item for over 15 yrs, and its quality has not changed/ my skin has not suffered from  yrs of using it, no drying out effect , most bubble bath do, and it does not allow a bath tub ring.  </li>
            <li>Glad I bought it for her.</li>
            <li>Love the bottle too.</li>
            <li>scent is lovely.</li>
            <li>The bubbles are very rich and foamy - like something you&#x27;d see in a movie.</li>
            <li>It helps keep my skin healthy and soft, not to mention it feels really great to use an hour or two before bed.</li>
            <li>It smells heavenly - very light, clean scent, makes a great lather - and leaves my skin really soft!  </li>
            <li>Love this, makes my skin feel so smooth.</li>
            <li>Other than that, it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li>Glad it is still available as I don&#x27;t like any of the cheap kid stuff.</li>
            <li>particular milk bath has a very respectable lavender scent.</li>
            <li>The scent is quite light - smells good and natural in the bottle</li>
            <li>She works in a stressful job and having a warm bath soak is very soothing to her.</li>
            <li>I tend to be a big bath reader - reading for hours at a time in the bath, so I am always on the lookout for great bubble baths.</li>
            <li>The scent is mild and soothing and leaves skin silky and smooth.  </li>
            <li>Makes good bubbles, but I don&#x27;t feel any moisture afterwards, drys me out actually.</li>
            <li>Perfect for a relaxing soak; the bubbles last and last.</li>
            <li>I tried many others but none that will let your skin feel smooth soft and smelling good all day long.</li>
            <li>I usually use Mr. Bubbles from the drug store because it&#x27;s easy to find and has great bubbles.  </li>
            <li>My family and friends are also keenly aware that I love lavender and find it very relaxing.</li>
            <li>The bubblebath works fine - it bubbles up a lot, the bubbles last for my whole bathtime, it smells nice, and it is inexpensive.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s almost no fragrance (an important feature in a relaxing bath!), and it doesn&#x27;t soften the bath water or the skin as the old product did.</li>
            <li>lavender and the lavender smell is really nice, but there is a touch of something else that has a sweet/powdery smell that just makes it off a tiny bit.  </li>
            <li>Nice big bottle for the price.</li>
            <li>I love the smell, it&#x27;s also soft on the skin.</li>
            <li>I loved it soo much that this is the third one I have bought.</li>
            <li>its worth trying.</li>
            <li>If there is a problem which there was, someone should have made it right.  </li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s funny</li>
            <li>As someone who takes a hour-long soaking bath at the end of each day to relax mind and body, I have sought long and hard, unsuccessfully, for a perfect soaking solution.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried several bubble baths before, this one is very outstanding, especially for the price.</li>
            <li>I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT!</li>
            <li>I probably just used too much, so I took that into account in my rating.  </li>
            <li>although I don&#x27;t worry about this as much as the ladies might.</li>
            <li>and it was very affordable..</li>
            <li>I also don&#x27;t like really smelly bath</li>
            <li>Who says a guy can&#x27;t enjoy a bubble bath...and without female company (we can&#x27;t always get what we want)</li>
            <li>She is very picky</li>
            <li>It really does make foamy bubbles that you see in television ads that are trying to advertise a luxurious bath.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t smell it in the bath much.</li>
            <li>The smell is just like &amp;#34;old lady&amp;#34; and it was too intense.</li>
            <li>but I couldn&#x27;t take the intense smell.</li>
            <li>It does leave the bottom of the tub VERY slippery</li>
            <li>Normally, there would be a foil seal under the cap!</li>
            <li>Since the total cost through Amazon is now considerably higher, you&#x27;re better off checking out local stores.</li>
            <li>When I got around to reviewing this, I saw that the packaging had changed from an old-fashioned jug to a streamlined container more typical of liquid soaps.</li>
            <li>This item was intended to be a gift, and the actual packaging looked much more like standard shampoo and not the bottle that&#x27;s shown.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a sickening smell either, unlike some other kinds of bath stuff</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>; getting lost in the bubbles is high priority with me.  </li>
            <li>Bottle lasts for a long time and ships quickly.</li>
            <li>I thought this item merely had new packaging, since the name is exactly the same as that of a product I&#x27;ve been happily using for years -</li>
            <li>now amazon is my new store,easy shop</li>
            <li>If Amazon gets the total cost back down to $6, this milk bath becomes a good deal again, and I will buy more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>As other reviewers have noted, it doesn&#x27;t take a tremendous amount to get a lot of bubbles.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m one of those guys, and I&#x27;m too old to worry what someone else might think of this.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin feel soft</li>
            <li>The smell is not overpowering at all, so if you hve a sensitive nose this will still work for you.  </li>
            <li>But I love the long long lasting bubbles</li>
            <li>but it was changed back after we let the company know we did not like the modern type container, so</li>
            <li>This fits the bill completely.</li>
            <li>The Milk Bath makes my skin and hair feel incredibly soft.</li>
            <li>The smell of lavender is very soothing after a long finals week or after you get rear-ended.</li>
            <li>Finally, a liquid foaming bath that has a pleasant, relaxing, and subtle lavendar aroma, does not dry my skin, and is affordable enough for daily use.    </li>
            <li>This won&#x27;t last that long but holds up pretty well.</li>
            <li>I did not actually use this product however I am rating this product at 3 stars because it has animal by product in it (milk protein derivitives) when it was clearly advertised as having no animal products.</li>
            <li>I will be sending it back due to their misadvertisement: &amp;#34;This product produces bubbles and is not intended for use in hot tubs or whirlpools.</li>
            <li>it took to much to get enough bubble&#x27;s, and didn&#x27;t last very long...</li>
            <li>Seriously, when I read the reviews for this product, I thought lightly of them...</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several bubble baths before, this one is very outstanding, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT!</li>
            <li> I probably just used too much, so I took that into account in my rating.  </li>
            <li> although I don&#x27;t worry about this as much as the ladies might.</li>
            <li> and it was very affordable..</li>
            <li> I also don&#x27;t like really smelly bath</li>
            <li> Who says a guy can&#x27;t enjoy a bubble bath...and without female company (we can&#x27;t always get what we want)</li>
            <li> She is very picky</li>
            <li> It really does make foamy bubbles that you see in television ads that are trying to advertise a luxurious bath.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t smell it in the bath much.</li>
            <li> The smell is just like &amp;#34;old lady&amp;#34; and it was too intense.</li>
            <li> but I couldn&#x27;t take the intense smell.</li>
            <li> It does leave the bottom of the tub VERY slippery</li>
            <li> Normally, there would be a foil seal under the cap!</li>
            <li> Since the total cost through Amazon is now considerably higher, you&#x27;re better off checking out local stores.</li>
            <li> When I got around to reviewing this, I saw that the packaging had changed from an old-fashioned jug to a streamlined container more typical of liquid soaps.</li>
            <li> This item was intended to be a gift, and the actual packaging looked much more like standard shampoo and not the bottle that&#x27;s shown.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a sickening smell either, unlike some other kinds of bath stuff</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> ; getting lost in the bubbles is high priority with me.  </li>
            <li> Bottle lasts for a long time and ships quickly.</li>
            <li> I thought this item merely had new packaging, since the name is exactly the same as that of a product I&#x27;ve been happily using for years -</li>
            <li> now amazon is my new store,easy shop</li>
            <li> If Amazon gets the total cost back down to $6, this milk bath becomes a good deal again, and I will buy more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> As other reviewers have noted, it doesn&#x27;t take a tremendous amount to get a lot of bubbles.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m one of those guys, and I&#x27;m too old to worry what someone else might think of this.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin feel soft</li>
            <li> The smell is not overpowering at all, so if you hve a sensitive nose this will still work for you.  </li>
            <li> But I love the long long lasting bubbles</li>
            <li> but it was changed back after we let the company know we did not like the modern type container, so</li>
            <li> This fits the bill completely.</li>
            <li> The Milk Bath makes my skin and hair feel incredibly soft.</li>
            <li> The smell of lavender is very soothing after a long finals week or after you get rear-ended.</li>
            <li> Finally, a liquid foaming bath that has a pleasant, relaxing, and subtle lavendar aroma, does not dry my skin, and is affordable enough for daily use.    </li>
            <li> This won&#x27;t last that long but holds up pretty well.</li>
            <li> I did not actually use this product however I am rating this product at 3 stars because it has animal by product in it (milk protein derivitives) when it was clearly advertised as having no animal products.</li>
            <li> I will be sending it back due to their misadvertisement: &amp;#34;This product produces bubbles and is not intended for use in hot tubs or whirlpools.</li>
            <li> it took to much to get enough bubble&#x27;s, and didn&#x27;t last very long...</li>
            <li> Seriously, when I read the reviews for this product, I thought lightly of them...</li>
            <li> By the way I am new to black soap and was amazed how non-drying it is.  </li>
            <li> It calms me down and makes me so soft!</li>
            <li> Only a small amount created lots of bubbles and they lasted the whole soak.  </li>
            <li> Only a small amount created lots of bubbles and they lasted the whole soak.</li>
            <li> the bubble last long time...</li>
            <li> For that I use African Black Soap, because it is the only soap that does not dry my skin.  </li>
            <li> Not only get lots of bubbles with a small amount of liquid, it leaves the skin soft and silky</li>
            <li> I have to rate this one higher than the other one (called Vanilla Amber) because at least this one has a noticeable scent.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m limited on the items I can use on my skin.</li>
            <li> The cap was loose when I opened the package and some of the product had leaked out.</li>
            <li> The scent is subtle yet relaxing, and it creates lots of lush bubbles that last awhile.</li>
            <li> My b/f spent an hour looking for it online</li>
            <li> Exactly as expected.  </li>
            <li> When I say a little goes a long way</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why this company doesn&#x27;t seal their products, especially liquids!</li>
            <li> I will not buy any other product.</li>
            <li> If you are not taking regular bubble baths you are seriously missing out!</li>
            <li> Need to try out other scents.</li>
            <li> But the black soap kills the bubbles in bubble bath.  </li>
            <li> And they last a ridiculous amount of time.</li>
            <li> What a mess.  </li>
            <li> take the edge off the lavender scent a little bit.  </li>
            <li> The scent was not very appealing, and it arrived leaking.</li>
            <li> In fact, it might be a little too noticeable, at least for a guy ...</li>
            <li> sorta had an urge to dab a little gasoline behind my ears after this bath.  </li>
            <li> I MEAN IT.</li>
            <li> Not good PR.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for years and the past couple years it has been difficult to find where I used to buy it.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately she couldn&#x27;t use it because it irritated her skin.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with this one!</li>
            <li> And I hate it when they make mixtures so opaque that you can&#x27;t see what&#x27;s in there.  </li>
            <li> - I&#x27;m very disappointed, and will not be ordering it again.</li>
            <li> This was awful!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> It smells heavenly - very light, clean scent, makes a great lather - and leaves my skin really soft!  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT!</li>
            <li> I did not actually use this product however I am rating this product at 3 stars because it has animal by product in it (milk protein derivitives) when it was clearly advertised as having no animal products. I bought this for my daughter who is vegan. I will be sending it back due to their misadvertisement: &amp;#34;This product produces bubbles and is not intended for use in hot tubs or whirlpools. We never test on animals or use animal-derived ingredients&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Very nice product for a great price. This stuff is really great. I used it as a bubble bath and a body wash. For the bubble bath I poured about 1/3 of the bottle in. I like a lot of bubbles. Really nice a body wash too. For the price I don&#x27;t mind buying it often. Oh and it smells awesome too!</li>
            <li> Most bath bubbles suck, but this one takes one cap-full and it fills my entire bathtub with a wonderful lavender aroma. It calms me down and makes me so soft! I love it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why this company doesn&#x27;t seal their products, especially liquids! The cap was loose when I opened the package and some of the product had leaked out. It wasn&#x27;t a huge deal, and it smells great, but i haven&#x27;t used it. I purchased this as a gift and i can&#x27;t help but think that the giftee might think that I opened it already? Normally, there would be a foil seal under the cap! No such thing!</li>
            <li> I have been using this bubble bath for over seven years and I love it.  I can&#x27;t take a bath without it.  When they changed the look they also changed which department it was in in the stores.  My b/f spent an hour looking for it online but I was freaking thinking they quit making it.  I honestly love this stuff makes my bath time my spa time.</li>
            <li> Great price, smells nice, bubbles well. I will definately get this product again. The lavender before bed is an added bonus for a good night sleep.</li>
            <li> Very good product.  Foams up nicely, smells great and creates a very relaxing bath.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Finally, a liquid foaming bath that has a pleasant, relaxing, and subtle lavendar aroma, does not dry my skin, and is affordable enough for daily use.    As someone who takes a hour-long soaking bath at the end of each day to relax mind and body, I have sought long and hard, unsuccessfully, for a perfect soaking solution.  Now I have found it!  Thanks!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite. I&#x27;m glad I was able to find this at Amazon. I&#x27;ve used it for years and the past couple years it has been difficult to find where I used to buy it. Couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere else either. Glad it is still available as I don&#x27;t like any of the cheap kid stuff.</li>
            <li> Not only get lots of bubbles with a small amount of liquid, it leaves the skin soft and silky</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several bubble baths before, this one is very outstanding, especially for the price. The scent is subtle yet relaxing, and it creates lots of lush bubbles that last awhile. Can&#x27;t go wrong with this one! I&#x27;ll definitely be buying again.</li>
            <li> This is the second bubble bath I&#x27;ve tried from Village Naturals.  I have to rate this one higher than the other one (called Vanilla Amber) because at least this one has a noticeable scent.  In fact, it might be a little too noticeable, at least for a guy ... sorta had an urge to dab a little gasoline behind my ears after this bath.  You know, to sorta take the edge off the lavender scent a little bit.  It&#x27;s probably me, though -- I probably just used too much, so I took that into account in my rating.  Cain&#x27;t help it, though; getting lost in the bubbles is high priority with me.  Oh! ... before I forget ... one more thing ... I wish they would take \\&quot;Milk\\&quot; out of the name.  Having it there makes me think I should rinse off real good afterward for the fear that if I don&#x27;t I might start smelling like cheese later on.  And I hate it when they make mixtures so opaque that you can&#x27;t see what&#x27;s in there.  Must be hiding something in there somewhere.  I&#x27;ll find out when I get to the bottom.  Maybe that&#x27;s there marketing plan -- hurry up and use it so I can see what the prize is.</li>
            <li> Great smell and lots of bubbles, was very happy with the product, wish bubbles would last longer, but overall, very nice product.</li>
            <li> I thought this item merely had new packaging, since the name is exactly the same as that of a product I&#x27;ve been happily using for years - NOT SO! It&#x27;s entirely different, the only similarity being that it bubbles in the bath. There&#x27;s almost no fragrance (an important feature in a relaxing bath!), and it doesn&#x27;t soften the bath water or the skin as the old product did. It might be an OK shower scrub, but that&#x27;s not why I bought it - I&#x27;m very disappointed, and will not be ordering it again. NO stars!</li>
            <li> When I got around to reviewing this, I saw that the packaging had changed from an old-fashioned jug to a streamlined container more typical of liquid soaps. I enlarged the photo above enough to see that Village Naturals claims that only the packaging has changed. I will take them at their word on this, but I know some reviewers feel that the bath milk formula has been altered (for the worse).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes guys like bubble baths and lavender, just like the ladies. I&#x27;m one of those guys, and I&#x27;m too old to worry what someone else might think of this. My family and friends are also keenly aware that I love lavender and find it very relaxing. When it comes to aromatherapy, this is the scent I prefer the most.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This particular milk bath has a very respectable lavender scent. It bubbles up very nicely. It also feels very nice as a skin moisturizer although I don&#x27;t worry about this as much as the ladies might. When I bought this, the total cost to me was about $6 (shipping included). Since the total cost through Amazon is now considerably higher, you&#x27;re better off checking out local stores. If Amazon gets the total cost back down to $6, this milk bath becomes a good deal again, and I will buy more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This really is a good product. It&#x27;s just not priced well at this time. I hope this helps.</li>
            <li> This product is perfect for a relaxing and refreshing soak.  The scent is mild and soothing and leaves skin silky and smooth.  Bottle lasts for a long time and ships quickly.</li>
            <li> It makes good bubbles but does not contribute to skin moisturizing. For that I use African Black Soap, because it is the only soap that does not dry my skin.  By the way I am new to black soap and was amazed how non-drying it is.  But the black soap kills the bubbles in bubble bath.  Oh well cannot have it all.  The Village Naturals I just received does not look like this pictured.  It says \\&quot;ultra moisturizing\\&quot; so I will see how that works.  By the way no animal testing.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t  care for village naturals it took to much to get enough bubble&#x27;s, and didn&#x27;t last very long... I also, bought Avon bubble delight I prefer Avon.</li>
            <li> i like the smell it is very nicely scented, and the bubble last long time...and it was very affordable..</li>
            <li> Seriously, when I read the reviews for this product, I thought lightly of them... When I say a little goes a long way... I MEAN IT. The smell of lavender is very soothing after a long finals week or after you get rear-ended. I enjoyed it throughly and would buy again! (but of course, not for a while... because I still have about 85% of it left after four or five baths!)</li>
            <li> Good stuff, but it&#x27;s $3 at Kroger.</li>
            <li> I only buy this product to use for me. I will not buy any other product. I tried many others but none that will let your skin feel smooth soft and smelling good all day long.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. My Walgreen&#x27;s used to sell it but they don&#x27;t anymore. I&#x27;m so glad I found it on Amazon. I have Excema and I&#x27;m limited on the items I can use on my skin. This works great. It makes my skin feel soft and I do not have any outbreaks afterwards.</li>
            <li> This item was intended to be a gift, and the actual packaging looked much more like standard shampoo and not the bottle that&#x27;s shown. The scent was not very appealing, and it arrived leaking. Went to the store and bought something nicer (though smaller) for the same price.</li>
            <li> Received this as a present from my hubby.  I love baths and bubble baths.  I usually use Mr. Bubbles from the drug store because it&#x27;s easy to find and has great bubbles.  I also don&#x27;t like really smelly bath products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is great.  It is milky and I figured it would make my bath greasy.  But it generates some nice bubbles and also makes my skin feel smooth.  It is a really nice combination.  The smell is not overpowering at all, so if you hve a sensitive nose this will still work for you.  I also got the mango scented milk bath (it has a stronger smell).  I use both and recommend both.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have any cons, unless you want bubbles to last 20+ minutes.  This won&#x27;t last that long but holds up pretty well.</li>
            <li> Who says a guy can&#x27;t enjoy a bubble bath...and without female company (we can&#x27;t always get what we want) LOL?  Only a small amount created lots of bubbles and they lasted the whole soak.  And of course the aroma is wonderful and helps create a very relaxing experience.  This is one great product.</li>
            <li> I like using it once or twice a week during my resting days. It helps keep my skin healthy and soft, not to mention it feels really great to use an hour or two before bed. Based on the name of this, I am sure you can guess it&#x27;s quite a relaxing mixture. It&#x27;s not a sickening smell either, unlike some other kinds of bath stuff I used (like vanilla stuff, yuck).</li>
            <li> My daughter loves this stuff and I buy some every year for her Christmas gift.  She works in a stressful job and having a warm bath soak is very soothing to her.</li>
            <li> The bubblebath works fine - it bubbles up a lot, the bubbles last for my whole bathtime, it smells nice, and it is inexpensive.</li>
            <li> Makes good bubbles, but I don&#x27;t feel any moisture afterwards, drys me out actually.</li>
            <li> Nice scent and good deal for the price.</li>
            <li> Goodness I love this product. The bubbles last and it smells wonderful. My skin feels lovely after each use. I love the bath salt as well.</li>
            <li> 4.5 stars would be better...I love lavender and the lavender smell is really nice, but there is a touch of something else that has a sweet/powdery smell that just makes it off a tiny bit.  But I love the long long lasting bubbles and I mostly love the smell!</li>
            <li> Soo great! It&#x27;s funny I bought this for my daughter hoping it wouldn&#x27;t react with her eczema (since most bubble baths do). Unfortunately she couldn&#x27;t use it because it irritated her skin. So I started using it and loved it, even got my husband hooked!</li>
            <li> Exactly as expected.  Perfect</li>
            <li> This is a great buy. If you are not taking regular bubble baths you are seriously missing out! This one has lavender and is a great relaxer for those stressful days or when you just feel like submerging yourself in some bubbly water.</li>
            <li> Be transported with this lovely foaming milk bath!  I look forward to it every evening.</li>
            <li> Got this for my granddaughter so I haven&#x27;t tried it but it smells really good. Nice big bottle for the price.</li>
            <li> I like this one the best, the scent stays longer in the bubbles and lathers up better will use again</li>
            <li> Wonderful product and feels great i thebath, relaxing, i am glad i got it and yes i would recommend this to all others</li>
            <li> I love the smell, it&#x27;s also soft on the skin. I loved it soo much that this is the third one I have bought.</li>
            <li> Came without  seal on the top when unscrewed.. Dont know if it is used or been tampered with?&lt;br /&gt; Should i still use it?</li>
            <li> Been using this bath item for over 15 yrs, and its quality has not changed/ my skin has not suffered from  yrs of using it, no drying out effect , most bubble bath do, and it does not allow a bath tub ring.  The bottle was change from the jug type but it was changed back after we let the company know we did not like the modern type container, so I can now get the jug again. its worth trying.</li>
            <li> I bought this Foaming Milk Bath for my stepmom who is in her 80&#x27;s.  She is very picky but she loved this product.  Produced a lot of bubbles and had a great fragrance.  Glad I bought it for her.</li>
            <li> Creates lots of bubbles and they last quite a while.  The smell is nice and not overpowering.  I&#x27;ll buy it again when this bottle is gone.</li>
            <li> Only a small amount created lots of bubbles and they lasted the whole soak. \\&quot; found it always in local stores now amazon is my new store,easy shop no hassle no lines and the best price</li>
            <li> Great product.  It smells great, bubbles up nicely and you don&#x27;t have to use a lot!!!  Should have ordered 4 instead of  2.</li>
            <li> This bubble bath is amazing. It really does make foamy bubbles that you see in television ads that are trying to advertise a luxurious bath. And they last a ridiculous amount of time. I tend to be a big bath reader - reading for hours at a time in the bath, so I am always on the lookout for great bubble baths. This fits the bill completely. The scent is quite light - smells good and natural in the bottle but I don&#x27;t smell it in the bath much. It leaves the water silky and nourishing feeling. Can&#x27;t recommend the product enough. Love the bottle too. Need to try out other scents.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product, taking a bath is made more enjoyable with this product and i  would recommend this to any friend or family member.  Thank you</li>
            <li> The Milk Bath makes my skin and hair feel incredibly soft.</li>
            <li> Thank you, I needed for my bath to relax, and releave the pain, wonderful product, Lavender is wonderful for body relaxation</li>
            <li> This was awful!! The smell is just like &amp;#34;old lady&amp;#34; and it was too intense. I got it for the kids and thought it would be a great value but I couldn&#x27;t take the intense smell. My grandmother loved it and so it is now at her house!</li>
            <li> As other reviewers have noted, it doesn&#x27;t take a tremendous amount to get a lot of bubbles. The bubbles are very rich and foamy - like something you&#x27;d see in a movie. If you&#x27;re like me, you may just find yourself building bubble sculptures. :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is lovely. Sometimes lavender can be overpowering, but not in this case. Perfect for a relaxing soak; the bubbles last and last. It does leave the bottom of the tub VERY slippery so use caution getting in and out! Other than that, it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li> Love this, makes my skin feel so smooth.</li>
            <li> The milk bath came and the entire package was soaked from the product.  What a mess.  A simple seal would have prevented the leakage that occured.  Amazon asked me before (shortly after it arrived) about if I received it and I noted the problem but didn&#x27;t hear anything from them.  Not good PR.  If there is a problem which there was, someone should have made it right.  A customer shouldn&#x27;t have to deal with a soggy package.</li>
