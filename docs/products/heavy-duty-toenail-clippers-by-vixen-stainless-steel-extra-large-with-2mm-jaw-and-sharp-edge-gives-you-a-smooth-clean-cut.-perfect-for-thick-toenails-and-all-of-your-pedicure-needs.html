            <li>Absolutely worth it!</li>

            <li>I use personally and believe will be good for others.</li>
            <li>I was able to clip my nails straight across without any breaks whatsoever.</li>
            <li>that not only looks good but also prevents rust.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not really understanding all the good reviews except maybe those people had strong hands.</li>
            <li>They are made of stainless steel so they will not be easily breakable.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend these clippers to anyone!!!</li>
            <li>These clippers are very sharp and cut very nicely.  </li>
            <li>They are made very sturdy and do not feel cheap at all</li>
            <li>That is why I prefer to groom my own nails instead of going to a salon because I simply cannot take any risks.</li>
            <li>They made a clean cut and the great thing for me is the&lt;br /&gt;wide jaw because I have thick toenails and with these I was able to cut them nicely and straight not like with other toenail clippers that I have tried I broke them</li>
            <li>just* right,</li>
            <li>Used these right away.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s wide handle provides increased leverage and control , it is made of brushed stainless steel for to prevent rust and tarnish There is a large built-in nail file,and holes for a key ring insert, this is a attractive design,that is convenient for travel, or as a great gift .&lt;br</li>
            <li>They are very round in shape, and this makes them easy to hold in your hand and get a nice grip.</li>

            <li>These are pretty sturdy and they clip nails well.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>received one or more of the products mentioned above for review purposes.</li>
            <li>Also, I must say these toenail clippers are quite pretty ...</li>

            <li>When I went to clip my toenail at first</li>
            <li>but then I moved my fingers back towards the end more</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t clip them the first time.</li>
            <li>However, thesẽ clippers cut them with the first clip.</li>
            <li>but this one is good and heavy.</li>
            <li>Great heavy duty clippers!!  </li>

            <li>They are also pretty sharp which helps with those who have very strong nails.</li>

            <li>&gt; The directions to use the product is clearly stated in the package of the product.</li>
            <li>I was worried about how well they cut, since the last pair of clippers I bought did not work very well.  </li>

            <li>Most are too curved if you have thick toe nails.  </li>
            <li>I know not very attractive or appealing toes to share with the world.</li>
            <li>The Vixen heavy duty toenail clipper did not leave a clean cut.  </li>
            <li>The clippers, while pretty, are smooth, stainless steel - a slippery surface that&#x27;s hard to grab, so your fingers slip on and off while trying to bear down.</li>
            <li>I am so glad to finally have found a pair of toenail clippers that will last me a long, long time.  </li>

            <li>Overall they are a high quality clipper and can see them lasting for years.</li>
            <li>Of coarse we still did soak his feet to get the nail soft.</li>
            <li>Not overly big or anything, but just larger than your normal &amp;#34;large&amp;#34; size clippers.</li>
            <li>These are very sturdy and sharp.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It should not be that difficult to produce a suitable pedicure nail clipper.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>and they were not wide enough.</li>
            <li>They are exactly what they claim to be (heavy duty toenail clippers).</li>
            <li>Now we are using the Large Heavy Duty Toenail Clipper from Vixen Supply which I received to review.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>This is the large heavy duty toe nail clipper by Vixen.</li>

            <li> When I went to clip my toenail at first</li>
            <li> but then I moved my fingers back towards the end more</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t clip them the first time.</li>
            <li> However, thesẽ clippers cut them with the first clip.</li>

            <li> and I appreciate reading and giving honest feedback about products that regular people like me use on a daily basis or consider buying.</li>
            <li> After attempting to fit the pieces back together, I found I could not, since, being an older person, I did not have the strength.</li>
            <li> I love this heavy duty toenail clipper by VIxen because it makes grooming my feet a whole lot easier!</li>
            <li> It is highly recommended to trim nail straight across not in a curvy position to avoid ingrown toe nail.</li>
            <li> They are wide enough to clip your toenails fast and effectively.</li>
            <li> After using these toenail clippers, I can honestly say that these clippers are strong, sharp and long lasting.  </li>
            <li> She also found the ergonomic handle harder, but that could just be she&#x27;s not as strong as she used to be.</li>
            <li> highly recommend this product , I received this product for a discount for an unbiased review .</li>

            <li> The toenail clipper looks very chic and the ergonomic curve handle makes it easy to get a firm grip.</li>
            <li> They come in their own little package with some usage instructions on the back.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s heavy duty, but easy to use.</li>
            <li> This nail clipper is large and very sturdy than the other normal nail clipper.</li>
            <li> &gt; The directions to use the product is clearly stated in the package of the product.</li>
            <li> I was worried about how well they cut, since the last pair of clippers I bought did not work very well.  </li>
            <li> &amp; I like the look of the brushed stainless steel.</li>
            <li> is a sturdy toenail clipper that should last for years &amp; because it is stainless steel it won&#x27;t rust.</li>
            <li> It gives a professional pedicure look to your toes.</li>
            <li> The brushed stainless steel finish  </li>
            <li> Also these clippers were able to cut through my thick toenails with ease.</li>
            <li> Most are too curved if you have thick toe nails.  </li>
            <li> I know not very attractive or appealing toes to share with the world.</li>
            <li> The Vixen heavy duty toenail clipper did not leave a clean cut.  </li>
            <li> The clippers, while pretty, are smooth, stainless steel - a slippery surface that&#x27;s hard to grab, so your fingers slip on and off while trying to bear down.</li>
            <li> I am so glad to finally have found a pair of toenail clippers that will last me a long, long time.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a 3.3&amp;#34; long, super sharp nail clipper for  a clean  cut for fingernails or toenails, this is a heavy duty nail clipper.</li>
            <li> This heavy duty toenail clipper is large and very sharp it cuts thick toenails cleanly and easily.</li>
            <li> This heavy duty toenail clipper is large and very sharp it cuts thick toenails cleanly and easily.</li>
            <li> I miss not having a small file with the unit to clean under the nails.</li>
            <li> My husband has been loving it too - having tough nails that just won&#x27;t quit!</li>
            <li> Overall they are a high quality clipper and can see them lasting for years.</li>
            <li> Of coarse we still did soak his feet to get the nail soft.</li>
            <li> Not overly big or anything, but just larger than your normal &amp;#34;large&amp;#34; size clippers.</li>
            <li> These are very sturdy and sharp.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It should not be that difficult to produce a suitable pedicure nail clipper.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> and they were not wide enough.</li>
            <li> They are exactly what they claim to be (heavy duty toenail clippers).</li>
            <li> Now we are using the Large Heavy Duty Toenail Clipper from Vixen Supply which I received to review.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> This is the large heavy duty toe nail clipper by Vixen.</li>
            <li> A little intense though.</li>
            <li> These are made out of high quality stain less steel</li>
            <li> The edge of the jaw in the nail clipper is very sharp which trims even the hardest and thick toe nail easily.</li>
            <li> I have found less than a handful of these types of nail clippers that live up to my expectations.</li>
            <li> Much easier to handle than those small ones you purchase in drug stores.</li>
            <li> It measures 3.5&amp;#34; long &amp; the jaws of the clipper open 2 millimeters.</li>
            <li> These toenail clippers will not rust and will last a very long time.  </li>
            <li> Would be a 5 if packaging wasnt partially opened and possibly returned/used.</li>
            <li> bigger than the regular clipper and blade very sharp .</li>
            <li> The brushed metal makes it a bit easier to get a solid grip than with the typical shiny metal you see on nail clippers.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone who is looking for clippers that actually clip and not rip your nails, and stay sharp after 2 clippings.</li>
            <li> These are larger than any other nail clippers I have ever used in my life.</li>
            <li> so it helps to trim  very large toe nail which is actually very difficult when we use the normal toe clippers.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this high quality nail clipper to anyone with very thick toenails.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this high quality nail clipper to anyone with very thick toenails.</li>
            <li> This one allows you to cut at angles and shape big toe nail and cut away a little at a time.</li>
            <li> It seems a bit silly to write a lengthy review on clippers, but anyone with nails like mine will know that finding clippers that won&#x27;t break -- or that have a blade opening large enough -- can be difficult.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two</li>
            <li> Misread description as wide opening for lg.</li>
            <li> It has a wide jaw</li>
            <li> This Heavy Duty Toenail Clippers By Vixen is definitely a must have!</li>
            <li> blade is plenty sharp, though, and once I held my mouth and hand</li>
            <li> They cut extremely well and clip through the nail effortlessly.  </li>
            <li> The design is sleek and the clipper is sharp.</li>
            <li> My toe nails have always been on the thicker side (if only my fingernails were thick as well), and these clippers had no problem trimming them.</li>
            <li> Very sharp to cut even the thickest of toenails.</li>
            <li> I received a previously returned product though.</li>
            <li> ; as those of us with thick, stiff nails need, maybe a brushed metal or rubber coating would help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It does not include the little nail file that some clippers do</li>
            <li> I have very thick toe nails and regular clippers</li>
            <li> I wanted straight cutting nail clippers</li>
            <li> They feel heavy and durable.</li>
            <li> my husband&#x27;s toenails had always been a pain with other clippers because his toenails are so thick and haRd to clip.  </li>
            <li> but what I can tell you is that these heavy duty toenail clippers by Vixen are officially my go to toenail clippers!</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I may be a product reviewer but my thoughts are real and none of the things I say on my reviews are made up or fake - they are all based on my experience/s with whatever product I am reviewing.</li>
            <li> If held at the end it is hard (for me anyway) to guide where on the toenail to cut.</li>
            <li> Average-no different than any other nail clipper--little disappointed</li>
            <li> They were longer then I expected and I was unable to hold it in the middle without my hand sliding down to the cutting edge, which is useless.</li>
            <li> Small piece flew off causing the handle to fall off!  </li>

            <li> These toenail clippers are amazing.  The first thing I noticed about the clippers were the curved design when you opened them.  They fit nicely in your hand and the curve makes it easy to grip when you are working on cutting.  I was worried about how well they cut, since the last pair of clippers I bought did not work very well.  I tried them out on my fingernails and was impressed with how well they actually cut.  They did not rip my nails like many clippers do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The true test came when I had my husband try them out on his toenails, and he was even impressed with how well they work.  It was nice not having his sharp toenails dig into me.  I would recommend this product to anyone who is looking for clippers that actually clip and not rip your nails, and stay sharp after 2 clippings.</li>
            <li> Unlike probably most people, I have toenails like granite, so my case may be unusual. It seems a bit silly to write a lengthy review on clippers, but anyone with nails like mine will know that finding clippers that won&#x27;t break -- or that have a blade opening large enough -- can be difficult.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two issues prevent the 5-star rating for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) The clippers, while pretty, are smooth, stainless steel - a slippery surface that&#x27;s hard to grab, so your fingers slip on and off while trying to bear down. If they&#x27;re &amp;#34;heavy duty,&amp;#34; as those of us with thick, stiff nails need, maybe a brushed metal or rubber coating would help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) In order to get any leverage on the blade, you have to squeeze the clippers from almost the very edge (farthest away from the blade). With the &amp;#34;heavy duty&amp;#34; condition of my nails, I couldn&#x27;t get enough pressure, and twice (with the help of the ultra-smooth metal) the clippers sprang out of my hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The blade is plenty sharp, though, and once I held my mouth and hand *just* right, everything worked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And there you go: TMI about clippers. :-)</li>
            <li> These are pretty sturdy and they clip nails well.&lt;br /&gt;I like that they aren&#x27;t cheap looking and they do what they ate suppose to.&lt;br /&gt;The only problem would be the packaging. The packaging looks cheap. , but the clippers are great.</li>
            <li> A great pair of toenail clipper is something that everyone needs in their bathroom medicine cabinet or toiletry kit. We&#x27;ve had several pairs over the years but most of them were not quality products so they didn&#x27;t work well or broke. Now we are using the Large Heavy Duty Toenail Clipper from Vixen Supply which I received to review.&lt;br /&gt;This is an attractive toenail clipper. It looks very sleek &amp; ergonomic. It has a curved design which makes it easier to grip &amp; I like the look of the brushed stainless steel. It measures 3.5&amp;#34; long &amp; the jaws of the clipper open 2 millimeters. Because of the curved design, you can get better leverage when using it &amp; it won&#x27;t slip.&lt;br /&gt;Both my husband &amp; I have used this toenail clipper. It works really well for both of us. This clipper is sharp &amp; cuts easily without tearing or breaking our toenails. It leaves a clean smooth edge &amp; I find that I don&#x27;t need to use a nail file after I use this clipper.&lt;br /&gt;This is a sturdy toenail clipper that should last for years &amp; because it is stainless steel it won&#x27;t rust. The only thing that I don&#x27;t like is that it is made in Pakistan. I prefer buying &amp; using products that are made in the US.</li>
            <li> These Toenail clippers are VERY strong and very well crafted! I let my hubby use them as he has really thick nails- very difficult to trim! These made easy work of it. No rips, no tears, just clean cuts. He was very happy!</li>
            <li> I wanted straight cutting nail clippers but these are curved...my fault.  The person I bought them for won&#x27;t use them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will test it out and see how it holds up.</li>
            <li> The Old Mountain Goat knows when I find something really good - 5 Stars for Vixen!!</li>
            <li> I love these toenail clippers works great I just got them and had to try them out. They made a clean cut and the great thing for me is the&lt;br /&gt;wide jaw because I have thick toenails and with these I was able to cut them nicely and straight not like with other toenail clippers that I have tried I broke them lol but with these I actually cut my toenails not broke the clippers. You have thick nails or need something that can cut your toenails nicely where here it is. The last toenail clipper that you will ever need</li>
            <li> Good size for toe nails!  Strong and sturdy!  Nice clippers!!</li>
            <li> These are nice and strong. My husband likes them for his toenails</li>
            <li> heavy duty clippers and very sturdy</li>
            <li> Works really well. Large size which is perfect. Works as described. Clips nails very easily and quickly. These guys are sharp so take it easy.</li>
            <li> Awesome clipper!&lt;br /&gt;Both my son and husband have the thickest toenails..with this clipper it&#x27;s quick and easy</li>
            <li> Great clippers. Would buy them over any others!</li>
            <li> bigger than the regular clipper and blade very sharp . Good quality .. it&#x27;s the best i have so far</li>
            <li> Hands down the best fingernail clippers I&#x27;ve ever had. They are made very sturdy and do not feel cheap at all</li>
            <li> Must return. Misread description as wide opening for lg. nails. It&#x27;s a tiny opening.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and easy to grip. 5 stars.</li>
            <li> These are definitely some great Heavy Duty Toenail clippers.&lt;br /&gt;Clipping my husband&#x27;s toenails had always been a pain with other clippers because his toenails are so thick and haRd to clip.  I saw these clippers being offered at a great promotional price so I wanted to get them and give them a try.&lt;br /&gt;Let&#x27;s just say, these have made clipping his nails so much easier.  They even have a curve to them that makes them easier to hold on to.&lt;br /&gt;These are definitely a great investment to have.</li>
            <li> I love this nail clipper. It&#x27;s heavy duty, but easy to use. Does a quick, clean cut without having to use a lot of pressure. 100% recommend</li>
            <li> Nice item. Great design. Shipped promptly. Thanks much!</li>
            <li> Diabetic feet are always tricky. That is why I prefer to groom my own nails instead of going to a salon because I simply cannot take any risks. I love this heavy duty toenail clipper by VIxen because it makes grooming my feet a whole lot easier! My husband has been loving it too - having tough nails that just won&#x27;t quit! Lol. I love purchasing high quality nail grooming products because I use them regularly and I want ones that will last. Two thumbs up for this clipper!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for review purposes. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for others. I refuse to review or endorse products that I have not or will not personally try. Needless to say, I may be a product reviewer but my thoughts are real and none of the things I say on my reviews are made up or fake - they are all based on my experience/s with whatever product I am reviewing. I’m just a regular consumer and I appreciate reading and giving honest feedback about products that regular people like me use on a daily basis or consider buying. My views and opinions are from a customer/end user’s standpoint.</li>
            <li> This toenail clipper is perfect for my husbands toenails. This toenail clipper is made of stainless steel it will not rust it&#x27;s also very strong, durable and easy to use. This heavy duty toenail clipper is large and very sharp it cuts thick toenails cleanly and easily. The toenail clipper looks very chic and the ergonomic curve handle makes it easy to get a firm grip. I would definitely recommend this high quality nail clipper to anyone with very thick toenails.</li>
            <li> I no sooner opened the package when this item literally fell apart in my hand. After attempting to fit the pieces back together, I found I could not, since, being an older person, I did not have the strength. So how did a nail clipper of all things fall apart? That&#x27;s what I want to know.</li>
            <li> I bought these for my husband and they really do cut those thick..thick nails. Of coarse we still did soak his feet to get the nail soft. These are the best clippers I&#x27;ve  found!</li>
            <li> Used these right away. They have a nice curve to them which make it easy to fit comfy in your hand. They are well made and are stainless steel. They cut extremely well and clip through the nail effortlessly.  Received this product for review.</li>
            <li> This clipper is all that! My former clipper would fly out of my hand while using but this one is good and heavy. I was able to clip my nails straight across without any breaks whatsoever. Superior quality is in this product.</li>
            <li> What an amazing toe nail clipper. This product came really well packaged and the build quality is great. I&#x27;m very happy with this product, the item description was right on and i&#x27;m pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I have tried a lot of clippers but these are the best i have ever used.  They really give all the control i need to do a great job on my toenails.  Work fine for fingers as well.  Very very satisfied with these clippers!</li>
            <li> Would be a 5 if packaging wasnt partially opened and possibly returned/used.I soaked in antiseptic and tried and they worked good.Dissapointing to have to worry bout possibilty I received a previously returned product though.</li>
            <li> After using these toenail clippers, I can honestly say that these clippers are strong, sharp and long lasting.  They are made of stainless steel so they will not be easily breakable.  Also these clippers were able to cut through my thick toenails with ease. Also, I must say these toenail clippers are quite pretty ... well for toenail clippers.  LOL  They are sleek and easy to hold.  I am so glad to finally have found a pair of toenail clippers that will last me a long, long time.  I was given this product in return for my testing and review and unbiased opinions.</li>
            <li> This is the large heavy duty toe nail clipper by Vixen. This nail clipper is large and very sturdy than the other normal nail clipper. It is made out of strong stainless steel which has a nice matte look to it also very strong. The product is slightly curved which makes it easy to handle the nail clipper and also gives a nice classy look to it . These are made out of high quality stain less steel so you need not worry of the product getting rusted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; It has a wide jaw so it helps to trim  very large toe nail which is actually very difficult when we use the normal toe clippers. The edge of the jaw in the nail clipper is very sharp which trims even the hardest and thick toe nail easily. It gives a professional pedicure look to your toes. This is very easy to use and easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The directions to use the product is clearly stated in the package of the product. It is highly recommended to trim nail straight across not in a curvy position to avoid ingrown toe nail.This is a great addition to my grooming tools . I am sure it is gonna stay very long in my home. Toe nail clippers are the once which we use regularly so quality is very important this nail clipper full fills every aspects that a perfect toe nail clipper needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I am very satisfied with this product and recommend this product to my family, friends and all others who are in search of a good toe nail clipper. I received this product complimentary in return for a honest review. I used this product and my opinion are 100% true and it is my own .</li>
            <li> These work great on thick and overgrown toenails . The metal is durable and doesn&#x27;t seem to be flimsy at all.  I am impressed with the overall design. It&#x27;s stylish and it works better than the toenail clippers I  have use. These toenail clippers will not rust and will last a very long time.  I love the easy grip on these. These get the job done the first time. Very easy to use. Very sharp to cut even the thickest of toenails.</li>
            <li> The Vixen heavy duty toenail clipper did not leave a clean cut.  The handle on top kept shifting and was difficult to maneuver.&lt;br /&gt;The item was returned.</li>
            <li> Very sturdy durable toenail clippers.  The cut is precise and it doesn&#x27;t leave any rough edges on the nail.  You don&#x27;t have to cut too many times to get the nail to look right.  Best clippers I&#x27;ve had in a long time.</li>
            <li> Strong clippers for toe nails. I miss not having a small file with the unit to clean under the nails. Otherwise, great.</li>
            <li> Best toenail clippers I ever owned.  Most are too curved if you have thick toe nails.  This one allows you to cut at angles and shape big toe nail and cut away a little at a time.</li>
            <li> Worked good for toenails. A little intense though. If you want some serious clippers then these are for you, handle with caution!</li>
            <li> Works well fast shipping A+++</li>
            <li> Same as others that you buy at the corner drugstore.  Disappointing.&lt;br /&gt;It should not be that difficult to produce a suitable pedicure nail clipper.&lt;br /&gt;The picture is deceiving.</li>
            <li> This Heavy Duty Toenail Clippers By Vixen is definitely a must have! I can&#x27;t tell you how many clippers I have in my house but what I can tell you is that these heavy duty toenail clippers by Vixen are officially my go to toenail clippers! They are made of stainless steel which means no rust and they will last for quite awhile. They are also pretty sharp which helps with those who have very strong nails. I love the way this toenail clipper has a curve to it and like that it&#x27;s bigger than most toenail clippers I&#x27;ve seen. It&#x27;s very easy to grip without having your hands slip and it cuts toenails without much force! I absolutely love these toenail clippers and would definitely recommend!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**I received a discount on this product for testing and reviewing purposes and this is my honest and unbiased opinion**</li>
            <li> I finally had to throw these away.. I&#x27;m not really understanding all the good reviews except maybe those people had strong hands. I found these very awkward to use. They were longer then I expected and I was unable to hold it in the middle without my hand sliding down to the cutting edge, which is useless. If held at the end it is hard (for me anyway) to guide where on the toenail to cut. Honestly I have no idea if these things cut well of not, I couldn&#x27;t manage to get any nail to cut.  My advise is to think twice before ordering.</li>
            <li> First time I have had toenail clippers break. The item snapped in half after two uses, very disappointed in the quality and will not purchase this brand again.</li>
            <li> Hey folks, I know it&#x27;s not a sexy topic, but these are really some darn good toenail clippers. They work as advertised and are easy to use. Even for the old ladies and their nasty toenails. Yes, recommended. Good value.</li>
            <li> The Toenail clippers were delivered in sealed packaging&lt;br /&gt;and were exactly as described on product page.  We&lt;br /&gt;purchased the clippers in a promotion for testing and&lt;br /&gt;review.  These are very sturdy and sharp.  Excellent&lt;br /&gt;construction, made of stainless steel.</li>
            <li> Great heavy duty clippers!!  Much easier to handle than those small ones you purchase in drug stores. Great buy, great service, great product.</li>
            <li> These really are heavy-duty. As for cutting thick nails, I had my mother test these on her caveman toes and they were not wide enough. She also found the ergonomic handle harder, but that could just be she&#x27;s not as strong as she used to be. I rather liked the shape of the handle. They really do cut straight and I haven&#x27;t had any jagged edges. Overall, I like these clippers. I&#x27;ve included a picture that shows the ergonomic shape and the clipper spacing. I hope that helps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Item received in exchange for review. All reviews, whether self-purchased or provided for review, will be completely honest.</li>
            <li> Perfect size, perfectcut, perfect tool.</li>
            <li> This toenail clipper is perfect for my husbands toenails. This toenail clipper is made of stainless steel it will not rust it&#x27;s also very strong, durable and easy to use. This heavy duty toenail clipper is large and very sharp it cuts thick toenails cleanly and easily. The toenail clipper looks very chic and the ergonomic curve handle makes it easy to get a firm grip. I would definitely recommend this high quality nail clipper to anyone with very thick toenails.</li>
            <li> These work great! They are exactly what they claim to be (heavy duty toenail clippers). The brushed metal makes it a bit easier to get a solid grip than with the typical shiny metal you see on nail clippers. The design is sleek and the clipper is sharp. My toe nails have always been on the thicker side (if only my fingernails were thick as well), and these clippers had no problem trimming them. Overall they are a high quality clipper and can see them lasting for years.</li>
            <li> I gotta say, these are the best and the best looking toenail clippers that I&#x27;ve ever owned. Absolutely worth it!</li>
            <li> Average-no different than any other nail clipper--little disappointed</li>
            <li> Great nail clippers. Easy to grip and hold on to.</li>
            <li> Very nice clippers.  Best that I&#x27;ve had.</li>
            <li> The toenail clippers I received look exactly as shown in the picture. They come in their own little package with some usage instructions on the back. When trying them for the first time they feel very smooth and have a sleek shape. They feel heavy and durable. It does not include the little nail file that some clippers do but that&#x27;s not something I needed. When I went to clip my toenail at first I thought that it wasn&#x27;t going to be able to clip my nail but then I moved my fingers back towards the end more and they worked perfect. They are wide enough to clip your toenails fast and effectively.</li>
            <li> Small piece flew off causing the handle to fall off!  Never got to use it.  Maybe for the best as the blade is &#x27;curved&#x27; &amp; I prefer clippers that cut nails straight across.</li>
            <li> These clippers are very sharp and cut very nicely.  These are probably the best clippers I have ever owned.</li>
            <li> I was fortunate to receive these nail clippers to test out. I have very thick toe nails and regular clippers don&#x27;t clip them the first time. I would have to try a couple of times. I know not very attractive or appealing toes to share with the world. However, thesẽ clippers cut them with the first clip. Which is a great relief!  I highly recommend these clippers to anyone!!!</li>
            <li> I have what you might call a nail clipper fetish! I have a good 20 nail clippers around my home. Some that I love, and others that I save just for use with my pets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am always trying to find a nail clipper that is comfortable in the hand, cuts well, and just is overall a great nail clipper. I have found less than a handful of these types of nail clippers that live up to my expectations. These do. These are larger than any other nail clippers I have ever used in my life. Not overly big or anything, but just larger than your normal &amp;#34;large&amp;#34; size clippers. They are very round in shape, and this makes them easy to hold in your hand and get a nice grip. You have a great amount of control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used these both on my hands and toes, and they are great to use for both. I really liked using them as apart of my pedicure for my feet. Clipping my toenails was so easy, and I got nice clean even cuts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are fantastic, and something I would definitely recommend to my family and friends!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note that I was sent this product complimentary to try out in my home in order to share my honest experience, thoughts and review.</li>
            <li> This is a awesome nail clipper it came just as described and was here very quickly , this is a product we all need to have in our bathrooms or toiletries kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a 3.3&amp;#34; long, super sharp nail clipper for  a clean  cut for fingernails or toenails, this is a heavy duty nail clipper. It&#x27;s wide handle provides increased leverage and control , it is made of brushed stainless steel for to prevent rust and tarnish There is a large built-in nail file,and holes for a key ring insert, this is a attractive design,that is convenient for travel, or as a great gift .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The larger nail clipper  makes it easy to handle so you can get a precision cut every time you use it. The wider handle  improve s grip and prevents finger slippage..The brushed stainless steel finish  that not only looks good but also prevents rust.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried this clipper out and it did a great job I have very hard toe nails but this did the job with ease and did not break , which I have done many times before .This is a great clipper that everyone should have .I highly recommend this product , I received this product for a discount for an unbiased review .</li>
