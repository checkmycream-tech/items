            <li> I love this polish, the color is awesome!!&#x27; And it was so easy to use with my led light! Going to buy a new color that changes soon.</li>
            <li> A comment for those below me giving 1 star because it won&#x27;t dry.&lt;br /&gt;The polish is a gel polish and will only cure under Uv or LED nail lamps.&lt;br /&gt;If left alone without the lamps, you can sit there for months and it still won&#x27;t dry for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please rewrite your reviews and stop 1 starring because you don&#x27;t know how to use a product.</li>
            <li> This crap doesn&#x27;t dry! Wipes off with tissue paper.</li>
            <li> Very fast shipping~it came in three days~good quality~both light pink and passion pink are very nice~color change fleetly! Sometimes the color becomes gradual changing color! Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> This nail polish is awesome!!! Last long, looks wonderful in every mood shade, will def. try more colors!</li>
            <li> Love it!!...two weeks and counting! Must use gel base and top coat w/polish and cure between each coat (coat color 2x).</li>
            <li> The colors really pretty and it&#x27;s fun because it&#x27;s constantly changing. The guys at work say they know I&#x27;m pissed when they turn white.</li>
            <li> Went on kinda chalky. Chipped in just a few days, did not have that &amp;#34;gel&amp;#34; finish that it is supposed to have</li>
            <li> I love this one, I use it as a base with other color changing polishes, like a French manicure and it is perfect.</li>
            <li> The polish lasts a long time and changes colors with cold and hot hand temperatures. The mood color changed all the way up till my next polish change.</li>
            <li> This is the perfect color</li>
            <li> Live it one of my new favorite.. along with a few others. .. I&#x27;m addicted to the color changing:-) thank you</li>
            <li> Love it greatest nail polish ever,but I was expecting it lighter I thought it was charry blosom just tryed hevenly angle on a nail but the nail Solon had charry blossom</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product twice since receiving it and both times after curing my nails when I wiped them with the cleaning pads all the polish comes off.  I have used gel polish before so I don&#x27;t know what is going on with this one.</li>
            <li> It literally does NOT dry on your nails. I held my nails in front of a fan for 20 minutes (seriously, I timed it) and they were still wet as the ocean. Total WASTE.</li>
            <li> This is a perfect gel color. It was very easy to apply thin coats. I selected to apply 3 coats for full coverage. The timer on my UV lamp is 120 seconds, and that seemed to work best for each coat (base, color 3 x&#x27;s, and top coat). When you are warm the color is a pale blush pink, almost white, and the color when you&#x27;re cold is a hot pink similar to a fuchsia. It certainly was a good purchase and I would definitely get this brand again. I&#x27;m a happy customer.</li>
            <li> Matte color.  Goes from white with a hint of pink to bright pink almost fuchsia.  Would like the light color to be a little more pink.</li>
            <li> I have natural nails and it doesn&#x27;t change colors on the tips as shown. The base color is not a very attractive pink. The pink it changes to is pretty. I would not buy this again.</li>
            <li> Before you give this 1 star: THIS IS A GEL POLISH!!!!!! YOU MUST USE A UV LAMP TO CURE IT!!!!!OTHERWISE IT WILL NOT DRY!!!!!!! You also need to cure it for 2 light cycles, or 2-4 minutes. If used PROPERLY, it will work and last for at least 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> Love it! So fun to watch my nails change color throughout the day. It&#x27;s very light, almost white, pink when warm and pretty fushia pink when cold. Will be buying more colors!</li>
            <li> More then expected I love me some pin and always change my colors so this is worth it all the way</li>
            <li> Amazing. I cannot stop showing off my nails. Everyone loves them. Washing my hands is so fun! I would buy this again, and again and again. Luckily, the bottle lasts so long, I won&#x27;t have to...But, I would!</li>
            <li> I am super happy! I love this product and have gotten so many compliments on it. Thank you!</li>
            <li> umm  yea would be nice to ALERT customers that they need a special expensive LIGHT to dry this stuff!! Waste of my money NOW!</li>
            <li> Awesome product, worked perfectly</li>
            <li> I like the color changing polishes and have tried a few. Warm color is the palest pink and cold color is almost a hot pink. I tend to look better in frosted colors, but this one has a creme finish and is quite pretty.It should have been named Cherry Blossom instead of the one that was named that.&lt;br /&gt;  In fact, I think I will try 1 coat of Cherry Blossom over 1 coat of Heavenly Angel and see what it looks like.</li>
            <li> Love this nail polish!</li>
            <li> I put this polish on and it looks great.  Problem-------IT DOES NOT DRY!!!!.  I waited for 45 minutes and it wasn&#x27;t dry.  To top it off ,&lt;br /&gt;it wiped right off with a Kleenex and didn&#x27;t even need polish remover.  Do not waste your money.</li>
            <li> super fun polish.  I have loved using it.</li>
            <li> I love this polish.  It is the perfect nude color and changes to a pretty Barbie pink when cold.  This can give you a French tip effect sometimes so just your tips are pink.  I love the mood changing polish as I am indecisive on when color to do, so this way it&#x27;s like two-in-one!  I bring this polish to my nail salon for them to apply it for me.  Love it!</li>
