            <li>They feel good, they work wonderfully!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think I would use this to style my hair as I&#x27;m blow drying, but it works beautifully when I&#x27;m brushing hair oil through as an overnight conditioner.</li>
            <li>I was so happy to find these brushes on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Great buy, great product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for curls and detangling.</li>
            <li>Great detangler.  </li>

            <li>Great Brush...</li>
            <li>This is a great brush.  </li>
            <li>It is a great feeling when I use it.</li>
            <li>This is a great brush.</li>
            <li>A great brush</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d mourn greatly if denman ever stopped making this brush.</li>
            <li>Denman boar bristle brushes are also great.</li>
            <li>that has great slip to it.</li>
            <li>Changing that is a HUGE difference!!!</li>
            <li>Made in UK is impressive when most items are from China.</li>
            <li>does it comb through nicely!</li>
            <li>The most awesome brush EVER!</li>
            <li>The price of $13.48 on Amazon is good, I paid $17 +</li>
            <li>I grease/oil my scalp because it feels so good against it.</li>
            <li>Good product</li>
            <li>it is good for styling and brushing my hair.</li>
            <li>so I need a good brush when I am detangling and washing my hair.  </li>
            <li>but this, as it turns out is a superior design.  </li>
            <li>For blowdrying, the brush provides plenty of tension for blowdrying, and does a good job of reaching the scalp.</li>
            <li>The weight is noticeable but the bristles feel so good on the scalp.</li>
            <li>It was also at a good price on Amazon.</li>
            <li>It was a good brush</li>
            <li>I have never owned a good hairbrush in my life.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good brush</li>
            <li>Anyway, the brush IS good.</li>
            <li>I am someone who likes the feel of pressure on my scalp and after running this brush all over it (over the sides, underneath, over the top) my scalp has never felt so good!</li>
            <li>Great  hair brush for any type of hair :  )</li>
            <li>I was very pleased to find this product via Amazon and now I have one brush and will soon be buying a spare.</li>
            <li>I love this brush, and I was so happy I could get it on line and did not have to go looking for it in the stores.</li>
            <li>I have been very pleased with the 9-row brush.  </li>
            <li>I love my Denman brush!</li>

            <li>Had to get him one of his own.</li>
            <li>I used to own this brush but lost it during a move.  </li>

            <li>/&gt;it was worth the wait!!!</li>
            <li>My daughter is very tender headed and this brush has made both of our lives more enjoyable during hair time!!!  </li>
            <li>Best brush for natural hair.</li>
            <li>If you have 4b/c-nap hair this is the best brush on the market you can buy by far.  </li>
            <li>The Best Hair Brush for my Natural 4c/4d hair.  </li>
            <li>i almost didnt want to finish it because this is by far the best brush that i have ever ever had in my 44 years of living .</li>
            <li>It makes detangling sooooo EASY!</li>

            <li>Great quality and very sturdy!</li>
            <li>Easy to clean &amp; feels so good on your scalp.</li>
            <li>Now we have wonderful Amazon and the net where you can find anything</li>
            <li>and today I am ordering two more.</li>
            <li>I LOVE these brushes.</li>
            <li>On top of all of this,there are areas where my hair is thicker and coarser than others.</li>
            <li>I was using a brush I got through Moroccan Oil, this is much better.</li>
            <li>I am so glad I purchased this.</li>
            <li>but it dang sure had the bristles I was looking for.</li>
            <li>and I found it to work perfect on short hair.  </li>
            <li>Completely satisfied.</li>
            <li>I love this brush.  </li>
            <li>and I see no reason why you wouldn&#x27;t love it.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>and I just love it.</li>
            <li>So glad I decided to purchase this.</li>
            <li>Love the weight that it has to it.  </li>
            <li>Its advertised as static resistant, and they weren&#x27;t kidding.  </li>
            <li>What more could you ask?  </li>
            <li>I still prefer the Denman ones over others, because the bristle tips are smooth, nicely rounded and gentler to one&#x27;s scalp than cheaper ones.</li>
            <li>it be styling or defining curls or detangling love it and want more</li>
            <li>He hasn&#x27;t seen it yet, but I am sure he will like it.</li>
            <li>Such a shame - used to be the best brush ever.</li>
            <li>I love the weight and feel of the brush.</li>
            <li>I love this brush &amp; have used Denman Brushes for years &amp; haven&#x60;t found anything better, although I have tried others in between.</li>
            <li>I love the way this detangles and had my curls poppin&#x27;.</li>
            <li>Love this brush&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I will continue to use this brush, but I think it&#x27;s just okay.</li>
            <li>No brush has ever been able to accomplish this without getting stuck or ripping out my hair.</li>
            <li>more durable rubber and came from Amazon as well.</li>
            <li>Was I ever glad to see it here</li>
            <li>Absolutly love this brush.</li>
            <li>20 more years of use to go.</li>
            <li>There simply isn&#x27;t a better brush on the market.</li>
            <li>Best brush for most uses back in the sixties......still is.  </li>
            <li>BETTER</li>
            <li>My mom and I love this brush, but I love it the most.</li>
            <li>I am so glad I will never see a 3&amp;#34; hair ball again.</li>
            <li>I love to use it for detangling, which is why I should have a lot of conditioner in my hair anyway.</li>
            <li>I love this brush even though I&lt;br /&gt;received</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pleased to say after phoning&lt;br /&gt;my</li>
            <li>over all great quality and for normal healthy hair</li>
            <li>also four teeth out of my goodly brush and the denman brushed my hair with a lot ease than my goodly.</li>
            <li>Very easy to keep clean.</li>
            <li>I just got this brush after reviewing all of the positive reviews on Amazon, and I just love love love this brush!  </li>
            <li>I cant say enough how happy i am about this brush, I love love love it.</li>
            <li>Here are the most important results I&#x27;ve noticed:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great styling tool for my natural hair</li>
            <li>Great brush, but not if you want baby soft bristles.</li>
            <li>and it cleansed easily because of the removable&lt;br /&gt;base and rows.</li>
            <li>It makes detangling sooo easy and does NOT snag or tare my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***Update</li>
            <li>It stimulates hair growth, decreases static and frizz in the hair because of the red rubber material, great for the toughest of tangles.</li>
            <li>The bristles are every strong and do not break.</li>
            <li>I have been using this brush 4 months strong</li>
            <li>This brush has weight and it is strong.</li>
            <li>This is hands down the best brush I have ever used!</li>
            <li>It is important to note I have been \\&quot;growing my hair</li>
            <li>Great brush and will buy shampoo brush next.</li>
            <li>The flexible bristles also make it easy to clean.</li>
            <li>I was surprised with the condition since most items from Amazon.com (versus third party sellers) arrive in excellent condition.</li>
            <li>easy to clean and wash.</li>
            <li>Overall this is a really great brush</li>
            <li>It feels well-built and feels comfortable in your hands.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean system.</li>
            <li>I love this brush and it is worth the price to have it.</li>
            <li>Feels good on my scalp, will definitely buy more.</li>
            <li>I thought this would have been a good detangling tool for my natural hair</li>
            <li>This brush is flexible, washable, dries quickly, comfortable to use, good for gentle scalp massage, and certainly  composed of hygienic materials.  </li>
            <li>It arrived in the time promised and in it&#x27;s original packaging.</li>
            <li>Great brush for LONG HAIR --- of which I am lacking...</li>
            <li>Totally worth it!</li>
            <li>This is the original Denman Brush.  </li>
            <li>Strong Bristles, heavy handle and a good price!  </li>
            <li>Makes hair super smooth and shiny when blow drying.</li>
            <li>Eases tangles, massages my scalp, it&#x27;s easy to clean and is not expensive.</li>
            <li>I have thick hair, so this brush is perfect for me.</li>
            <li>Best brush for my thick hair ever</li>
            <li>The quality is as good as it was back then.  </li>
            <li>So far I am loving it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just glad to have hair still, really.  </li>
            <li>I love this brush very much it is very well built, sturdy and durable.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s tried and true.  </li>
            <li>The brush is very nice and easy to clean, but, as it says it is Heavy Weight......</li>
            <li>Eventually the red rubber part comes apart but it does take many, many years to do it.</li>
            <li>I am a guy growing my hair to donate it and just needed something that wouldn&#x27;t fall apart on me like the pieces I saw at the super market.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t have to purchase another in the future so buying a 9 row to change it to a 5 row and eventually adding them back once my hair gets longer is a great investment!</li>
            <li>It is my 4th one and the only problems I&#x27;ve ever had is that the handle broke on 2 of my first ones (which fit perfectly in my purse without the handle so not that big a problem) and that my husband likes to take it, use it and put it away in his drawer.</li>
            <li>Wet or dry, LOVE, LOVE, LOVE my Denman!!</li>
            <li>Smooths my curls down and it works great for detangling.</li>
            <li>So yes,  the brush is worth the money and my hair is worthy of the brush.</li>
            <li>Very happy with these brushes, though I wish there were more colors offered, but black is universal ;-)</li>
            <li>It is strong and sturdy and clearly very well made.</li>
            <li>I can honestly say I&#x27;ve never loved a hair brush so after reading such wonderful reviews I had to try this one.</li>
            <li>After the first year, the rubber in mine gave out!</li>
            <li>But with this brush, I am able to get a nice ponytail without all of the harsh brushing and pulling.</li>
            <li>Is it worth $16 for a hairbrush?</li>
            <li>I am a woman of color with natural hair and have so many hair textures on my head.</li>
            <li>2015 Mistress Susan Secret Stuff Awards Winner for Best Detangling Brush.</li>
            <li>As my natural hair grew and became thicker and more fuller . . .</li>
            <li>If you want a brush to last and give your a nice feeling on every stroke of the way, this is it.</li>
            <li>Well worth the cost.</li>
            <li>that it&#x27;s all worth it.</li>
            <li>This brush is nice and heavy and I am sure I will not experience the break.</li>
            <li>Also love this brush to just smooth my hair back out after wind blown etc.  </li>
            <li>For the naturally kinky women out there, please be sure that you use plenty conditioner (or your product of choice)</li>
            <li>Other pluses are out gives a nice scalp massage,  removes shed hair and gives me a smooth wrap.  </li>
            <li>DID GET THE RIGHT ONE</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m between hair styles right now, so I am just safety braiding my hair in quarters at night after scalp treating, hair conditioning, and brushing.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is the first detangling brush that I have ever used that hasn&#x27;t broken in my hair, even the bristles are still in perfect condition.</li>
            <li>(nice little head massage as the bristles are strong too).  </li>
            <li>Works great with fine, curly hair as well as on thick, curly or straight hair.</li>
            <li>have a super mixed range of hair, mostly 4b/4c,</li>
            <li>Very heavy duty and can easily go through a good amount of hair - more likely to rip your hair out before brush gives out.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The older Denman brush&#x27;s (exact same one) tips are much more pliable and was always so comfortable.  </li>
            <li>The last Denman brush I had was very light weight and kept flying out of my hand while I was styling or blow drying.  </li>
            <li>I often use my denman on wet hair which clumps my curls together, putting significant more strain on the brush.</li>
            <li>I am so happy that Amazon is out there where I can buy hard to find items like the Denman Brush.  </li>
            <li>This brush is ok, I think it would br better without the rubber cushion, it pulls on my hair a little too much.</li>
            <li>The first one I bought in London - maybe at Sassoons (?)</li>
            <li>When the first one wore out, we didn&#x27;t have the internet then</li>
            <li>I think I&#x27;ve used this type of Denman brush almost 40 years as I think I bought that first one in 1972...</li>
            <li>I read many reviews about this brush prior to purchasing.</li>
            <li>sure enough did.</li>
            <li>I find that one of those curves brushes works better for my short hair.</li>
            <li>It evidently wore out.</li>
            <li>I purchased the first in a neighborhood beauty supply store about twenty years ago.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure I will continue to use for the next 25+ years.</li>
            <li>and it is great for getting through thick or curly hair.  </li>
            <li>The nine row has a solid handle giving it more weight and allowing the brush to do the work rather than the user forcing it.</li>
            <li>I use it primarily to detangle my 3b/3c natural hair and to encourage curl formation for wash and go styling.  </li>
            <li>Maybe even for a man with thick wavy hair (this will be a great gift to someone like this that I have in mind).</li>
            <li>This one is good and heavy, hopefully this one won&#x27;t break</li>
            <li>Best brush for super long and thick hair.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>But good weight and quality brush if a stiff bristle is your preference.</li>
            <li>The plastic bristles are kind of sharp to start with</li>
            <li>did, if not I can keep this 9-row heavy one because it is super easy to clean with just hot water &amp; my nails against the rubber pad.</li>
            <li>The Denman is a high quality brush and well worth the investment.</li>
            <li>my hair is super thick and curly, I&#x27;ve gone natural in the last year and this is probably the best product i purchased</li>
            <li>Necessity usually dictates I do this to keep the ends looking good</li>
            <li>I thought maybe the brush was&lt;br /&gt;helping to release shed hair, until I switched back to my large&lt;br /&gt;wide-toothed combed and experienced less hair loss.</li>
            <li>It is great to use on my wet or dry hair.</li>
            <li>So glad I found it on Amazon and was able to get another one for less than in the local beauty supply.  </li>
            <li>I am learning as I get older that quality DOES make a difference!</li>
            <li>It is also great for distributing conditioners and other products through my super curly, super thick (3c/4a) hair.</li>
            <li>i liked that little added decoration.</li>
            <li>I have used Denman brushes since the late 70&#x27;s :) I have tried other brands, but I am done with that because, in my opinion, this is the best brush on the market for my long, curly/very wavy hair.</li>
            <li>so I had to really do some searching</li>
            <li>for real.  </li>
            <li>no matter how much I brush.</li>
            <li>But it does wonders and really allows each curl to be defined and curled.</li>
            <li>haha</li>
            <li>In the shower or out it doesn&#x27;t take much effort to detangle my hair with this brush.</li>
            <li>it really does work wonders in de-tangling my hair.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this brush!</li>
            <li>This brush is much heavier than it looks.</li>
            <li>Detangles my hair gently and efficiently.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery.</li>
            <li>Use gently.</li>
            <li>Makes brushing her curly hair so much easier.</li>
            <li>really?</li>
            <li>would highly recommend this brush!</li>
            <li>The &amp;#34;smooth, round-edged pins&amp;#34; are not so gentle on my scalp.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t comb my hair using the handle as that puts too much pressure on the pins which press into my scalp.</li>
            <li>SO MUCH EASIER.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this brush!  </li>
            <li>, I figured there couldn&#x27;t be much of a difference between it and the Denman.  </li>
            <li>I used it on my mom&#x27;s hair too and she wants one.</li>
            <li>After using, my hair is SO much easier to manage.</li>
            <li>This is very upsetting to me&amp;#34;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Curls are always popped, haha.</li>
            <li>although i am gentle with my hair, it still ripped my hair out but that bc</li>
            <li>It makes detangling so much easier.</li>
            <li>I bought this brush from Sally&#x27;s because I saw it on a few YouTube videos &amp; I liked the bristles on the brush.</li>
            <li>heavy but still handy.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t recall, since I&#x27;ve been natural, being able to see the different curls patterns I have.</li>
            <li>I purchased the lighter weight version and that is not for me - this one is good for a thick head of hair.</li>
            <li>They last a very long time, are easy to clean and untangle my hair with the first stroke.  </li>
            <li>I also like that the bristles are stiff as they give a nice massage while brushing.</li>
            <li>I bought several other Denmans&#x27; and this one is a good one too.</li>
            <li>Because it&#x27;s nylon rather than plastic, you don&#x27;t get the static you would from other products and the rubber head</li>
            <li>This is firm and great for long, straight hair.</li>
            <li>The bristles on this brush are much sharper than an older model we have.  </li>
            <li>Years ago an old friend gave me my first Denman brush.</li>
            <li>I would of course never use it on dry or even lightly dampened curly curly hair.</li>
            <li>I use it primarily to blow dry my hair and detangle after washing.</li>
            <li>actually it came really quick...</li>
            <li>This is a high quality and well made brush from the UK.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>i highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&amp;#34;I mean its a good brush with the bristles and the top, but the handle is too small it hurts.</li>
            <li>This little guy will blow your mind and leave you sex and satisfied.</li>
            <li>and i LOVEEE using this on my wet hair to detangle and smooth out my ends.</li>
            <li>It may cost extra but it is worth every cent.</li>
            <li>I love this brush, it is nice and stiff, just what I need for my curly thick hair.  </li>
            <li>blow dry my long medium curly hair straight with this one and love how it feels on my head</li>
            <li>In fact, &amp;#34;on&amp;#34; is the right word --- they simply cannot penetrate into the hair.</li>
            <li>so I wanted to buy a new one, plus I bought one for each of my Granddaughters.</li>
            <li>I live on the island of Barbados</li>
            <li>Hers still looks new like the day that we purchased it.</li>
            <li>This is a live account of her feedback</li>
            <li>I have been using this brush for over 20 ears and it is the only one I will use on my wet, baby fine, brittle, straight hair.</li>
            <li>The 9 row Denman brush has a strong handle and is a much heavier brush then other brushes that look similar.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s only noticeable the first week or so.</li>
            <li>so I decided to finally ordered this one nd like most of the other reviews I took four teeth out of this and</li>
            <li>when i first brushed though my hair</li>
            <li>Next time I may spend a little more on the Denman brush.</li>
            <li>I use this for natural, curly black/AA hair to detangle and style.</li>
            <li>I believe this brush helps distribute my hair&#x27;s natural oil because my hair feels softer and looks shiner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am a natural girl</li>
            <li>I have 3c/4a natural hair &amp; I</li>
            <li>The light handle and heavy weight brush are unbalanced in my hand.</li>
            <li>I have natural hair</li>
            <li>however within&lt;br /&gt;there are 3c and 4a hair textures, and well as just some spots of&lt;br /&gt;loosely textured &amp;#34;frizz&amp;#34; with no curl near my forehead and crown.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>My hair is natural.</li>
            <li>Works well with natural hair.</li>
            <li>My cousin, a natural hair stylist, recommended it</li>
            <li>a must have for all natural ;choose your style</li>
            <li>I got it to supplement a 20 year old one that I still use every day.</li>
            <li>I had to replace my old one because the rubber split.</li>
            <li>This is an outstanding hairbrush for anyone with thick hair.</li>
            <li>Styling brush successfully detangle my hair, but I have seen less breakage and hair loss using it these last few days than any comb or brush</li>
            <li>The other aspect of this brand is that you can take the brush apart for a super thorough cleaning if need be and it lasts a LONG time so well worth the initial investment.</li>
            <li>I had so many brushes it was ridiculous</li>
            <li>its hardy heavy brush just is not for regular use for my more very fragile transiting to natural hair.  </li>
            <li>This brush is quite heavy and would be great for thick-ish, long hair since the hair does tend to stay smoothed down once brushed with this.  </li>
            <li>I went right through my thick 4/c hair; I was absolutely amazed!</li>
            <li>, there is very little breakage and the brush itself is holding up fabulously.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is well made and works very well on long hair</li>
            <li>I have natural thick curls and this brush can handle my hair just fine.</li>
            <li>And forget cheap brushes with plastic handles that break in two, followed by that distinctive &amp;#34;plop&amp;#34; as the head splashes down in the toilet.</li>
            <li>The bristles are longer on the new brush but they almost look like they&#x27;re made of a different type of plastic, not a sturdy.</li>
            <li>The Denman brand holds up very well to daily use with a hair dryer and always last for years.</li>
            <li>Heavy weighted brush is designed great for pulling through long thick hair.</li>
            <li>This brush feels so good on my scalp and is made very well considering others I have bought and broken in the past.</li>
            <li>It is not to be used on very wet hair though, damp is fine but it might rip some hair out if it is too wet.</li>
            <li>With my short hair thin hair the &amp;#34;Smooth, round-ended pins for gentle, snag-free styling&amp;#34; do dig into my my scalp more than my last brush that had larges pin ends.</li>
            <li>Hard to comfortably brush.</li>
            <li>I use the heavy duty one as my hair is very thick; that one is black and white but this is perfect for medium thick to fine hair.</li>
            <li>My old one is starting to show signs of wear (after 20 years!)</li>
            <li>I have had a different model Denman for 15 years and it was looking so old and ratty that I wanted to replace it.  </li>
            <li>I used to have to wash it once or twice a week due to excessive dandruff and itching (drying the hair strands and my scalp excessively), now I have been able to reduce it to once a month and my hair stays clean.</li>
            <li>Right now, it reaches a little more than half way down the back of my neck.  </li>
            <li>My cousin who is a guy and had absolutely bo idea abt comb or even the brand also said he prefers using the denman over my other brush</li>
            <li>Thanks to this brush, I don&#x27;t need combs for anything other than making parts.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t done the whole &#x27;remove every other row&#x27; trick yet, but if there isn&#x27;t a lot of conditioner in my hair</li>
            <li>After using the imitation brush 2x, I logged on to Amazon like the sensible woman I am and replaced the pretender with the real thing.  </li>
            <li>My hair is kinky curly, soft, short ( from big chop 9 months ago)</li>
            <li>My daughter&#x27;s hair had broken many brushes and combs but this brush is sturdy enough for that not to happen.</li>
            <li>I have thick, curly hair which makes it more difficult to find strong grooming products.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve owned these types of Denman brushes with the regular handles for years, and they never fail at the black handle.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this brush or any other Denman brush.</li>

            <li> I have been using a Denman brush for about 25 years now on the recommendation from a friend, they are the best.  </li>
            <li> The very best features are it&#x27;s construction.</li>

            <li> It detangles beautifully.</li>
            <li> They feel good, they work wonderfully!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I would use this to style my hair as I&#x27;m blow drying, but it works beautifully when I&#x27;m brushing hair oil through as an overnight conditioner.</li>
            <li> I was so happy to find these brushes on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Great buy, great product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for curls and detangling.</li>
            <li> Great detangler.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for de-tangling  and smoothing the hair.</li>
            <li> Great Brush...</li>
            <li> This is a great brush.  </li>
            <li> It is a great feeling when I use it.</li>
            <li> This is a great brush.</li>
            <li> A great brush</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d mourn greatly if denman ever stopped making this brush.</li>
            <li> Denman boar bristle brushes are also great.</li>
            <li> that has great slip to it.</li>
            <li> Changing that is a HUGE difference!!!</li>
            <li> Made in UK is impressive when most items are from China.</li>
            <li> does it comb through nicely!</li>
            <li> The most awesome brush EVER!</li>
            <li> The price of $13.48 on Amazon is good, I paid $17 +</li>
            <li> I grease/oil my scalp because it feels so good against it.</li>
            <li> Good product</li>
            <li> it is good for styling and brushing my hair.</li>
            <li> so I need a good brush when I am detangling and washing my hair.  </li>
            <li> but this, as it turns out is a superior design.  </li>
            <li> For blowdrying, the brush provides plenty of tension for blowdrying, and does a good job of reaching the scalp.</li>
            <li> The weight is noticeable but the bristles feel so good on the scalp.</li>
            <li> It was also at a good price on Amazon.</li>
            <li> It was a good brush</li>
            <li> I have never owned a good hairbrush in my life.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good brush</li>
            <li> Anyway, the brush IS good.</li>
            <li> I am someone who likes the feel of pressure on my scalp and after running this brush all over it (over the sides, underneath, over the top) my scalp has never felt so good!</li>
            <li> Great  hair brush for any type of hair :  )</li>
            <li> I was very pleased to find this product via Amazon and now I have one brush and will soon be buying a spare.</li>
            <li> I love this brush, and I was so happy I could get it on line and did not have to go looking for it in the stores.</li>

            <li> Had to get him one of his own.</li>
            <li> I used to own this brush but lost it during a move.  </li>
            <li> bristles glide really nicely through my hair</li>
            <li> /&gt;it was worth the wait!!!</li>
            <li> My daughter is very tender headed and this brush has made both of our lives more enjoyable during hair time!!!  </li>
            <li> Best brush for natural hair.</li>
            <li> If you have 4b/c-nap hair this is the best brush on the market you can buy by far.  </li>
            <li> The Best Hair Brush for my Natural 4c/4d hair.  </li>
            <li> i almost didnt want to finish it because this is by far the best brush that i have ever ever had in my 44 years of living .</li>
            <li> It makes detangling sooooo EASY!</li>
            <li> I love this brush, it detangles and smooths my natural hair perfectly in preparation for styling.</li>
            <li> Great quality and very sturdy!</li>
            <li> Easy to clean &amp; feels so good on your scalp.</li>
            <li> Now we have wonderful Amazon and the net where you can find anything</li>
            <li> and today I am ordering two more.</li>
            <li> I LOVE these brushes.</li>
            <li> On top of all of this,there are areas where my hair is thicker and coarser than others.</li>
            <li> I was using a brush I got through Moroccan Oil, this is much better.</li>
            <li> I am so glad I purchased this.</li>
            <li> but it dang sure had the bristles I was looking for.</li>
            <li> and I found it to work perfect on short hair.  </li>
            <li> Completely satisfied.</li>
            <li> I love this brush.  </li>
            <li> and I see no reason why you wouldn&#x27;t love it.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> and I just love it.</li>
            <li> So glad I decided to purchase this.</li>
            <li> Love the weight that it has to it.  </li>
            <li> Its advertised as static resistant, and they weren&#x27;t kidding.  </li>
            <li> What more could you ask?  </li>
            <li> I still prefer the Denman ones over others, because the bristle tips are smooth, nicely rounded and gentler to one&#x27;s scalp than cheaper ones.</li>
            <li> it be styling or defining curls or detangling love it and want more</li>
            <li> He hasn&#x27;t seen it yet, but I am sure he will like it.</li>
            <li> Such a shame - used to be the best brush ever.</li>
            <li> I love the weight and feel of the brush.</li>
            <li> I love this brush &amp; have used Denman Brushes for years &amp; haven&#x60;t found anything better, although I have tried others in between.</li>
            <li> I love the way this detangles and had my curls poppin&#x27;.</li>
            <li> Love this brush&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I will continue to use this brush, but I think it&#x27;s just okay.</li>
            <li> No brush has ever been able to accomplish this without getting stuck or ripping out my hair.</li>
            <li> more durable rubber and came from Amazon as well.</li>
            <li> Was I ever glad to see it here</li>
            <li> Absolutly love this brush.</li>
            <li> 20 more years of use to go.</li>
            <li> There simply isn&#x27;t a better brush on the market.</li>
            <li> Best brush for most uses back in the sixties......still is.  </li>
            <li> BETTER</li>
            <li> My mom and I love this brush, but I love it the most.</li>
            <li> I am so glad I will never see a 3&amp;#34; hair ball again.</li>
            <li> I love to use it for detangling, which is why I should have a lot of conditioner in my hair anyway.</li>
            <li> I love this brush even though I&lt;br /&gt;received</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pleased to say after phoning&lt;br /&gt;my</li>
            <li> over all great quality and for normal healthy hair</li>

            <li> I cant say enough how happy i am about this brush, I love love love it.</li>
            <li> Here are the most important results I&#x27;ve noticed:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Great styling tool for my natural hair</li>
            <li> Great brush, but not if you want baby soft bristles.</li>
            <li> and it cleansed easily because of the removable&lt;br /&gt;base and rows.</li>
            <li> It makes detangling sooo easy and does NOT snag or tare my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***Update</li>
            <li> It stimulates hair growth, decreases static and frizz in the hair because of the red rubber material, great for the toughest of tangles.</li>
            <li> The bristles are every strong and do not break.</li>
            <li> I have been using this brush 4 months strong</li>
            <li> This brush has weight and it is strong.</li>
            <li> This is hands down the best brush I have ever used!</li>
            <li> It is important to note I have been \\&quot;growing my hair</li>
            <li> Great brush and will buy shampoo brush next.</li>
            <li> The flexible bristles also make it easy to clean.</li>
            <li> I was surprised with the condition since most items from Amazon.com (versus third party sellers) arrive in excellent condition.</li>
            <li> easy to clean and wash.</li>
            <li> Overall this is a really great brush</li>
            <li> It feels well-built and feels comfortable in your hands.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean system.</li>
            <li> I love this brush and it is worth the price to have it.</li>
            <li> Feels good on my scalp, will definitely buy more.</li>
            <li> I thought this would have been a good detangling tool for my natural hair</li>
            <li> This brush is flexible, washable, dries quickly, comfortable to use, good for gentle scalp massage, and certainly  composed of hygienic materials.  </li>
            <li> It arrived in the time promised and in it&#x27;s original packaging.</li>
            <li> Great brush for LONG HAIR --- of which I am lacking...</li>
            <li> Totally worth it!</li>
            <li> This is the original Denman Brush.  </li>
            <li> Strong Bristles, heavy handle and a good price!  </li>
            <li> Makes hair super smooth and shiny when blow drying.</li>
            <li> Eases tangles, massages my scalp, it&#x27;s easy to clean and is not expensive.</li>
            <li> I have thick hair, so this brush is perfect for me.</li>
            <li> Best brush for my thick hair ever</li>
            <li> The quality is as good as it was back then.  </li>
            <li> So far I am loving it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just glad to have hair still, really.  </li>
            <li> I love this brush very much it is very well built, sturdy and durable.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s tried and true.  </li>
            <li> The brush is very nice and easy to clean, but, as it says it is Heavy Weight......</li>
            <li> Eventually the red rubber part comes apart but it does take many, many years to do it.</li>
            <li> I am a guy growing my hair to donate it and just needed something that wouldn&#x27;t fall apart on me like the pieces I saw at the super market.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t have to purchase another in the future so buying a 9 row to change it to a 5 row and eventually adding them back once my hair gets longer is a great investment!</li>
            <li> It is my 4th one and the only problems I&#x27;ve ever had is that the handle broke on 2 of my first ones (which fit perfectly in my purse without the handle so not that big a problem) and that my husband likes to take it, use it and put it away in his drawer.</li>
            <li> Wet or dry, LOVE, LOVE, LOVE my Denman!!</li>
            <li> Smooths my curls down and it works great for detangling.</li>
            <li> So yes,  the brush is worth the money and my hair is worthy of the brush.</li>
            <li> Very happy with these brushes, though I wish there were more colors offered, but black is universal ;-)</li>
            <li> It is strong and sturdy and clearly very well made.</li>
            <li> I can honestly say I&#x27;ve never loved a hair brush so after reading such wonderful reviews I had to try this one.</li>
            <li> After the first year, the rubber in mine gave out!</li>
            <li> But with this brush, I am able to get a nice ponytail without all of the harsh brushing and pulling.</li>
            <li> Is it worth $16 for a hairbrush?</li>
            <li> I am a woman of color with natural hair and have so many hair textures on my head.</li>
            <li> 2015 Mistress Susan Secret Stuff Awards Winner for Best Detangling Brush.</li>
            <li> As my natural hair grew and became thicker and more fuller . . .</li>
            <li> If you want a brush to last and give your a nice feeling on every stroke of the way, this is it.</li>
            <li> Well worth the cost.</li>
            <li> that it&#x27;s all worth it.</li>
            <li> This brush is nice and heavy and I am sure I will not experience the break.</li>
            <li> Also love this brush to just smooth my hair back out after wind blown etc.  </li>
            <li> For the naturally kinky women out there, please be sure that you use plenty conditioner (or your product of choice)</li>
            <li> Other pluses are out gives a nice scalp massage,  removes shed hair and gives me a smooth wrap.  </li>
            <li> DID GET THE RIGHT ONE</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m between hair styles right now, so I am just safety braiding my hair in quarters at night after scalp treating, hair conditioning, and brushing.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is the first detangling brush that I have ever used that hasn&#x27;t broken in my hair, even the bristles are still in perfect condition.</li>
            <li> (nice little head massage as the bristles are strong too).  </li>
            <li> Works great with fine, curly hair as well as on thick, curly or straight hair.</li>
            <li> have a super mixed range of hair, mostly 4b/4c,</li>
            <li> Very heavy duty and can easily go through a good amount of hair - more likely to rip your hair out before brush gives out.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The older Denman brush&#x27;s (exact same one) tips are much more pliable and was always so comfortable.  </li>
            <li> The last Denman brush I had was very light weight and kept flying out of my hand while I was styling or blow drying.  </li>
            <li> I often use my denman on wet hair which clumps my curls together, putting significant more strain on the brush.</li>
            <li> I am so happy that Amazon is out there where I can buy hard to find items like the Denman Brush.  </li>
            <li> This brush is ok, I think it would br better without the rubber cushion, it pulls on my hair a little too much.</li>
            <li> The first one I bought in London - maybe at Sassoons (?)</li>
            <li> When the first one wore out, we didn&#x27;t have the internet then</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;ve used this type of Denman brush almost 40 years as I think I bought that first one in 1972...</li>
            <li> I read many reviews about this brush prior to purchasing.</li>
            <li> sure enough did.</li>
            <li> I find that one of those curves brushes works better for my short hair.</li>
            <li> It evidently wore out.</li>
            <li> I purchased the first in a neighborhood beauty supply store about twenty years ago.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure I will continue to use for the next 25+ years.</li>
            <li> and it is great for getting through thick or curly hair.  </li>
            <li> The nine row has a solid handle giving it more weight and allowing the brush to do the work rather than the user forcing it.</li>
            <li> I use it primarily to detangle my 3b/3c natural hair and to encourage curl formation for wash and go styling.  </li>
            <li> Maybe even for a man with thick wavy hair (this will be a great gift to someone like this that I have in mind).</li>
            <li> This one is good and heavy, hopefully this one won&#x27;t break</li>
            <li> Best brush for super long and thick hair.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> But good weight and quality brush if a stiff bristle is your preference.</li>
            <li> The plastic bristles are kind of sharp to start with</li>
            <li> did, if not I can keep this 9-row heavy one because it is super easy to clean with just hot water &amp; my nails against the rubber pad.</li>
            <li> The Denman is a high quality brush and well worth the investment.</li>
            <li> my hair is super thick and curly, I&#x27;ve gone natural in the last year and this is probably the best product i purchased</li>
            <li> Necessity usually dictates I do this to keep the ends looking good</li>
            <li> I thought maybe the brush was&lt;br /&gt;helping to release shed hair, until I switched back to my large&lt;br /&gt;wide-toothed combed and experienced less hair loss.</li>
            <li> It is great to use on my wet or dry hair.</li>
            <li> So glad I found it on Amazon and was able to get another one for less than in the local beauty supply.  </li>
            <li> I am learning as I get older that quality DOES make a difference!</li>
            <li> It is also great for distributing conditioners and other products through my super curly, super thick (3c/4a) hair.</li>
            <li> i liked that little added decoration.</li>
            <li> I have used Denman brushes since the late 70&#x27;s :) I have tried other brands, but I am done with that because, in my opinion, this is the best brush on the market for my long, curly/very wavy hair.</li>
            <li> so I had to really do some searching</li>
            <li> for real.  </li>
            <li> no matter how much I brush.</li>
            <li> But it does wonders and really allows each curl to be defined and curled.</li>
            <li> haha</li>
            <li> In the shower or out it doesn&#x27;t take much effort to detangle my hair with this brush.</li>
            <li> it really does work wonders in de-tangling my hair.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this brush!</li>
            <li> This brush is much heavier than it looks.</li>
            <li> Detangles my hair gently and efficiently.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> Use gently.</li>
            <li> Makes brushing her curly hair so much easier.</li>
            <li> really?</li>
            <li> would highly recommend this brush!</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;smooth, round-edged pins&amp;#34; are not so gentle on my scalp.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t comb my hair using the handle as that puts too much pressure on the pins which press into my scalp.</li>
            <li> SO MUCH EASIER.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this brush!  </li>
            <li> , I figured there couldn&#x27;t be much of a difference between it and the Denman.  </li>
            <li> I used it on my mom&#x27;s hair too and she wants one.</li>
            <li> After using, my hair is SO much easier to manage.</li>
            <li> This is very upsetting to me&amp;#34;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Curls are always popped, haha.</li>
            <li> although i am gentle with my hair, it still ripped my hair out but that bc</li>
            <li> It makes detangling so much easier.</li>
            <li> I bought this brush from Sally&#x27;s because I saw it on a few YouTube videos &amp; I liked the bristles on the brush.</li>
            <li> heavy but still handy.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t recall, since I&#x27;ve been natural, being able to see the different curls patterns I have.</li>
            <li> I purchased the lighter weight version and that is not for me - this one is good for a thick head of hair.</li>
            <li> They last a very long time, are easy to clean and untangle my hair with the first stroke.  </li>
            <li> I also like that the bristles are stiff as they give a nice massage while brushing.</li>
            <li> I bought several other Denmans&#x27; and this one is a good one too.</li>
            <li> Because it&#x27;s nylon rather than plastic, you don&#x27;t get the static you would from other products and the rubber head</li>
            <li> This is firm and great for long, straight hair.</li>
            <li> The bristles on this brush are much sharper than an older model we have.  </li>
            <li> Years ago an old friend gave me my first Denman brush.</li>
            <li> I would of course never use it on dry or even lightly dampened curly curly hair.</li>
            <li> I use it primarily to blow dry my hair and detangle after washing.</li>
            <li> actually it came really quick...</li>
            <li> This is a high quality and well made brush from the UK.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> i highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&amp;#34;I mean its a good brush with the bristles and the top, but the handle is too small it hurts.</li>
            <li> This little guy will blow your mind and leave you sex and satisfied.</li>
            <li> and i LOVEEE using this on my wet hair to detangle and smooth out my ends.</li>
            <li> It may cost extra but it is worth every cent.</li>
            <li> I love this brush, it is nice and stiff, just what I need for my curly thick hair.  </li>
            <li> blow dry my long medium curly hair straight with this one and love how it feels on my head</li>
            <li> In fact, &amp;#34;on&amp;#34; is the right word --- they simply cannot penetrate into the hair.</li>
            <li> so I wanted to buy a new one, plus I bought one for each of my Granddaughters.</li>
            <li> I live on the island of Barbados</li>
            <li> Hers still looks new like the day that we purchased it.</li>
            <li> This is a live account of her feedback</li>
            <li> I have been using this brush for over 20 ears and it is the only one I will use on my wet, baby fine, brittle, straight hair.</li>
            <li> The 9 row Denman brush has a strong handle and is a much heavier brush then other brushes that look similar.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s only noticeable the first week or so.</li>
            <li> so I decided to finally ordered this one nd like most of the other reviews I took four teeth out of this and</li>
            <li> when i first brushed though my hair</li>
            <li> Next time I may spend a little more on the Denman brush.</li>
            <li> I use this for natural, curly black/AA hair to detangle and style.</li>
            <li> I believe this brush helps distribute my hair&#x27;s natural oil because my hair feels softer and looks shiner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am a natural girl</li>
            <li> I have 3c/4a natural hair &amp; I</li>
            <li> The light handle and heavy weight brush are unbalanced in my hand.</li>
            <li> I have natural hair</li>
            <li> however within&lt;br /&gt;there are 3c and 4a hair textures, and well as just some spots of&lt;br /&gt;loosely textured &amp;#34;frizz&amp;#34; with no curl near my forehead and crown.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> My hair is natural.</li>
            <li> Works well with natural hair.</li>
            <li> My cousin, a natural hair stylist, recommended it</li>
            <li> a must have for all natural ;choose your style</li>
            <li> I got it to supplement a 20 year old one that I still use every day.</li>
            <li> I had to replace my old one because the rubber split.</li>
            <li> This is an outstanding hairbrush for anyone with thick hair.</li>
            <li> Styling brush successfully detangle my hair, but I have seen less breakage and hair loss using it these last few days than any comb or brush</li>
            <li> The other aspect of this brand is that you can take the brush apart for a super thorough cleaning if need be and it lasts a LONG time so well worth the initial investment.</li>
            <li> I had so many brushes it was ridiculous</li>
            <li> its hardy heavy brush just is not for regular use for my more very fragile transiting to natural hair.  </li>
            <li> This brush is quite heavy and would be great for thick-ish, long hair since the hair does tend to stay smoothed down once brushed with this.  </li>
            <li> I went right through my thick 4/c hair; I was absolutely amazed!</li>
            <li> , there is very little breakage and the brush itself is holding up fabulously.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is well made and works very well on long hair</li>
            <li> I have natural thick curls and this brush can handle my hair just fine.</li>
            <li> And forget cheap brushes with plastic handles that break in two, followed by that distinctive &amp;#34;plop&amp;#34; as the head splashes down in the toilet.</li>
            <li> The bristles are longer on the new brush but they almost look like they&#x27;re made of a different type of plastic, not a sturdy.</li>
            <li> The Denman brand holds up very well to daily use with a hair dryer and always last for years.</li>
            <li> Heavy weighted brush is designed great for pulling through long thick hair.</li>
            <li> This brush feels so good on my scalp and is made very well considering others I have bought and broken in the past.</li>
            <li> It is not to be used on very wet hair though, damp is fine but it might rip some hair out if it is too wet.</li>
            <li> With my short hair thin hair the &amp;#34;Smooth, round-ended pins for gentle, snag-free styling&amp;#34; do dig into my my scalp more than my last brush that had larges pin ends.</li>
            <li> Hard to comfortably brush.</li>
            <li> I use the heavy duty one as my hair is very thick; that one is black and white but this is perfect for medium thick to fine hair.</li>
            <li> My old one is starting to show signs of wear (after 20 years!)</li>
            <li> I have had a different model Denman for 15 years and it was looking so old and ratty that I wanted to replace it.  </li>
            <li> I used to have to wash it once or twice a week due to excessive dandruff and itching (drying the hair strands and my scalp excessively), now I have been able to reduce it to once a month and my hair stays clean.</li>
            <li> Right now, it reaches a little more than half way down the back of my neck.  </li>
            <li> My cousin who is a guy and had absolutely bo idea abt comb or even the brand also said he prefers using the denman over my other brush</li>
            <li> Thanks to this brush, I don&#x27;t need combs for anything other than making parts.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t done the whole &#x27;remove every other row&#x27; trick yet, but if there isn&#x27;t a lot of conditioner in my hair</li>
            <li> After using the imitation brush 2x, I logged on to Amazon like the sensible woman I am and replaced the pretender with the real thing.  </li>
            <li> My hair is kinky curly, soft, short ( from big chop 9 months ago)</li>
            <li> My daughter&#x27;s hair had broken many brushes and combs but this brush is sturdy enough for that not to happen.</li>
            <li> I have thick, curly hair which makes it more difficult to find strong grooming products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned these types of Denman brushes with the regular handles for years, and they never fail at the black handle.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this brush or any other Denman brush.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t even realize I was ordering the &#x27;heavy weight&#x27; model, but I&#x27;m so glad I did because that was the exact reason I was ordering another denman; because the handle on my previous one had broken off.</li>
            <li> This and other Denman products from Amazon have arrived in open packaging and appear to be returns or old stock.</li>
            <li> I feel a bit silly leaving such a long review for --- of all things --- a hairbrush, but it really is an outstanding product.</li>
            <li> Bought my first in the late 70&#x27;s from my stylist.  </li>
            <li> The way these prongs run across your scalp is enough to write a book rivaling 50 shades of grey.</li>
            <li> Instant curls for medium to long hair...</li>
            <li> My hair natural and is of course tangled when worn down.</li>
            <li> After extensive use, either the white plastic bristles start to break or the pink rubber degenerates.  </li>
            <li> Everything about this brush is made for thick hair, be it short or long, curly or straight.</li>
            <li> Especially when you&#x27;re holding it for a long time to blow dry your hair&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I dry and flat</li>
            <li> Although this model is a little heavier than the regular 9-row denman it is well worth it if you have really thick, curly, Afro textured hair.</li>
            <li> but now I just need to decide how long do I want to go. :</li>
            <li> I recommend using it through really wet hair and combing through deep conditioned hair, it gets through all the tangles in a breeze!</li>
            <li> have been using this brush for a long time and got this one for my daughter</li>
            <li> but it didn&#x27;t last as I had expected it too.</li>
            <li> I get the same result with a wide tooth comb.</li>
            <li> brushing my hair and braiding it every night will make it grow longer, I will do it as long as this brush continues to be manufactured.</li>
            <li> It is very sturdy and it doesn&#x27;t pull my thick hair.</li>
            <li> tried removing every other row, I tried only using 3 rows, I tried 5,&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
            <li> This purchase was replacement for a smaller size Denman lost during travel some time ago and endless searches turned up nothing.  </li>
            <li> I did modify the brush and remove every other row, it definitely made detangling my kinky hair</li>
            <li> I expect to have this brush for a very long time.</li>
            <li> I know that I will have this brush for a very long time.</li>
            <li> Heavy weight handle is not worth the additional cost over normal Denman handle, for me.  </li>
            <li> It is heavy, but I wouldn&#x27;t say it makes brushing or blowdrying my hair more difficult.</li>
            <li> I initially bought an imitation brush to replace it</li>
            <li> Every single piece in this brush is removable for sterilization.  </li>
            <li> I have 3 Denmans,  one fell apart after maybe 3 years (which is not normal at all) and they shipped a replacement.  </li>
            <li> Women with loose curls/waves will have no problem with this brush as-is.</li>
            <li> I finally broke down and got a Denman Brush.</li>
            <li> They last for about 10 years before the rubber starts to break down.</li>
            <li> You can use it on wet or dry hair.  </li>
            <li> and I was shocked by how quickly it arrived and the fact that the supplier shipped it directly to me.</li>
            <li> This brush slips through wet tangled hair faster than a comb, without causing damage.</li>
            <li> brushing my hair in sections when its wet after</li>
            <li> I use this brush on my wet, coily hair.</li>
            <li> But I must say that it does accumulate a lot of the dead hair, so it is essential to keep cleaning it.  </li>
            <li> with soaking wet hair and conditioner, damp hair with leave-in, but</li>
            <li> It is made out of a harder...</li>
            <li> I use it in the shower on my wet hair</li>
            <li> I rather stick to my wide tooth comb.</li>
            <li> i was curious about the fuss of a denman brush , so i researced it .to</li>
            <li> This was money well spent.</li>
            <li> Not only does the Denman Heavy Duty, 9-Row</li>
            <li> everyone must get this brush if you have thick, natural hair.</li>
            <li> Even though my hair is short I decided to purchase the 9 row heavy duty so that I could remove every other row and have 5 remaining rows so it could comb through my hair with ease and boy</li>
            <li> (Mine is also long and slightly wavy, not at all kinky or curly.)</li>
            <li> I have spent tons of money on other brushes that just ended up pulling my hair out after 6 months of use.</li>
            <li> I was considering getting one of those alternated bristle brushes, but I won&#x27;t have any other brush to my hair now.</li>
            <li> the glowing reviews this brush received by other Naturally&lt;br /&gt;kinky textured ladies on youtube.</li>
            <li> I modified the brush by taking out every other row, leaving me with 5 rows.</li>
            <li> I modified the brush by taking out every other row of the brush</li>
            <li> I will not use any other brush.</li>
            <li> Less hair loss after shampoo or wet</li>
            <li> so this particular brush (heavy weight), is heavy, which means it can handle my thick hair and the bristles doesn&#x27;t damage my hair.  </li>
            <li> let me just say that i have very thick course natural hair</li>
            <li> Less snagging and breakage than with other combs or brushes.</li>
            <li> I decided to our purchase a new one and the tips are hard HARD</li>
            <li> Thanks to my current hair products (Fantasia Naturals Tea Tree Oil line, and an essential oil mixture (Tea Tree Oil, Peppermint Oil, Aloe Vera Oil) with a Fractionated Coconut Oil base)</li>
            <li> Therefore money down the drain.</li>
            <li> I kept reading reviews on this and hearing a lot about it on black hair websites.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t stop detangling in the shower because I have so much less breakage  </li>
            <li> and this brush, I have found myself needing to wash my hair less and less.</li>
            <li> My hair has never been healthier and I am seeing less split ends.</li>
            <li> Bristles are too stiff and sharp for my head.  </li>
            <li> I have long thick hair</li>
            <li> The flexible brush bristles have reduced hair breakage and there is a lot less hair left behind in the brush and down the drain after shampooing.&lt;br /&gt;2)</li>
            <li> so I ordered the \\&quot;Heavy Weight 9-row\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I bought this one because it was heavy weight handle.  </li>
            <li> I needed a Heavy Weight Denman Brush.</li>
            <li> I wanted just one brush and a heavy duty one</li>
            <li> Its heavy</li>
            <li> The brush is surprisingly heavy</li>
            <li> Heavy duty version lasts years as it is well made and holds up to years of heavy use.</li>
            <li> I am also buying a few to make care packages for my aunts.</li>
            <li> is in another few years as well, but this is THE brush.</li>
            <li> If you have thin hair, you don&#x27;t need this brush, it&#x27;s way too much brush for thin hair.</li>
            <li> I have owned this brand for 20 years now and was afraid they had stopped making the heavy duty version as all I could find was a much cheaper one in the stores.</li>
            <li> The pins are really stiff if you&#x27;re looking for a stiff brush...</li>
            <li> but two were immediately confiscated by my teenaged son who also has long, very thick hair.</li>
            <li> Natural bristle brushes are aesthetically pleasing, but utterly useless on thick hair.</li>
            <li> No static electricity</li>
            <li> and i use to to break combs and brushes in the past.</li>
            <li> I had a small purse like Denman Brush</li>
            <li> My goal is to grow my hair past my shoulder blades.</li>
            <li> handle is just too small.</li>
            <li> but the handle is just too small.</li>
            <li> The bristles are very stiff</li>
            <li> but it felt a bit hard on my hair</li>
            <li> This is one hard working brush.</li>
            <li> I know, hard to believe.</li>
            <li> This sucker has weight to it and I am not worried about losing it.  </li>
            <li> I understand that the company recently was sold so I am guessing they are cutting corners.  </li>
            <li> it 2 weeks late because&lt;</li>
            <li> I have thick, curly hair</li>
            <li> I have thick, medium length 4B/C hair.</li>
            <li> I would recomend it for anyone with thick hair</li>
            <li> I mean c&#x27;mon</li>
            <li> again, to only experience painful breaking and pulling of my hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> If you have thick hair, this is your secret weapon.</li>
            <li> This brush makes detangling my daughters thick curly hair a breeze!</li>
            <li> so all in all you will not regret buying this brush if you have a very thick hair</li>
            <li> but my hair is very thick.</li>
            <li> This brush is heavy!!!  </li>
            <li> No bristle has broken off either.</li>
            <li> my hair is  very weak.  </li>
            <li> I am so angry because it took a lot for me to buy a brush at that price.</li>
            <li> The component the bristles stick into moves in and out of the handset when I brush my hair which makes it difficult to brush my hair continuously.</li>
            <li> And it was a really expensive brush.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and it was a Denman FAKE,</li>
            <li> but i thought wrong.</li>
            <li> After I used 3 times with dryer the brush became useless.</li>
            <li> Is it fake?</li>
            <li> I was wrong.  </li>
            <li> Can NEVER go wrong with the Denman hair styling tools.</li>
            <li> I looked around town for a replacement and they were very expensive.</li>
            <li> I bought this brush for my son because they are almost impossible to find anywhere else.</li>
            <li> And mt ponytail would still look bad.</li>
            <li> : the denman gold lettering has began to smudge off :(</li>
            <li> I somehow lost my Denman and was desperate!</li>
            <li> /&gt;:(</li>
            <li> 7-22-15***&lt;br /&gt;Soooo, just got my brush in today and I am completely disappointed.</li>
            <li> I guess I will have to go to a nearby Sally&#x27;s beauty supply to ensure I get what I want :-(</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t be mad at that!</li>
            <li> the rubber base cracks and you have to buy another one.  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> If you have thick hair, this is your secret weapon. It detangles well and smooths hair nicely.</li>
            <li> I love my Denman brush! I am learning as I get older that quality DOES make a difference! I expect to have this brush for a very long time. It detangles and does NOT pull out my hair.</li>
            <li> This brush is ok, I think it would br better without the rubber cushion, it pulls on my hair a little too much.</li>
            <li> My mom always used Denman brushes &amp; I&#x27;ve started using them as well.  Love them!  Easy to clean &amp; feels so good on your scalp.</li>
            <li> I have thick hair, so this brush is perfect for me. The 9 row Denman brush has a strong handle and is a much heavier brush then other brushes that look similar. I&#x27;ve used knock-off brands of this brush before, but the knock-offs aren&#x27;t made as well - I either break the handle while brushing through my hair or the rubber part of the brush comes apart. The Denman brand holds up very well to daily use with a hair dryer and always last for years. The plastic bristles are kind of sharp to start with but it&#x27;s only noticeable the first week or so. This brush slips through wet tangled hair faster than a comb, without causing damage. Everything about this brush is made for thick hair, be it short or long, curly or straight. If you have thin hair, you don&#x27;t need this brush, it&#x27;s way too much brush for thin hair. The price of $13.48 on Amazon is good, I paid $17 + tax from a beauty supply store at the mall.</li>
            <li> Is it worth $16 for a hairbrush? I use this for natural, curly black/AA hair to detangle and style. It has 9 rows of bristles and heavier than the D3/7 row. I also used it detangle my wet,  conditioned short hair &amp; for my sister&#x27;s waist length natural hair with equal results. It detangles beautifully. Other pluses are out gives a nice scalp massage,  removes shed hair and gives me a smooth wrap.  Of course the rubber Pad and  teeth are  removable  to be cleaned and sanitized,  and they have great customer service to boot! I have 3 Denmans,  one fell apart after maybe 3 years (which is not normal at all) and they shipped a replacement.  Can&#x27;t be mad at that! So yes,  the brush is worth the money and my hair is worthy of the brush.</li>
            <li> The bristles on this brush are much sharper than an older model we have.  Hard to comfortably brush.</li>
            <li> Best brush for natural hair.</li>
            <li> This brush helps detangle, but the part with the bristles keeps sliding off the part with the handle. Therefore money down the drain. I am so angry because it took a lot for me to buy a brush at that price.</li>
            <li> Eventually the red rubber part comes apart but it does take many, many years to do it. The first one I bought in London - maybe at Sassoons (?) - and I&#x27;ve been hooked ever since. When the first one wore out, we didn&#x27;t have the internet then so I had to really do some searching and then I ordered four but two were immediately confiscated by my teenaged son who also has long, very thick hair. My Mom (same hair) also took one. Now we have wonderful Amazon and the net where you can find anything and today I am ordering two more. I LOVE these brushes. They feel good, they work wonderfully! I think I&#x27;ve used this type of Denman brush almost 40 years as I think I bought that first one in 1972...</li>
            <li> If you have 4b/c-nap hair this is the best brush on the market you can buy by far.  for real.  do yourself the favor.</li>
            <li> I was so happy to find these brushes on Amazon. My hair stylist and friend recommended this brand over twenty years ago, I bought one for myself and each of my girls back then. My old one is starting to show signs of wear (after 20 years!) so I wanted to buy a new one, plus I bought one for each of my Granddaughters. Very happy with these brushes, though I wish there were more colors offered, but black is universal ;-)</li>
            <li> Best brush for my thick hair ever</li>
            <li> I can honestly say I&#x27;ve never loved a hair brush so after reading such wonderful reviews I had to try this one. I have long thick hair so I ordered the \\&quot;Heavy Weight 9-row\\&quot;. Here are the most important results I&#x27;ve noticed:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) The flexible brush bristles have reduced hair breakage and there is a lot less hair left behind in the brush and down the drain after shampooing.&lt;br /&gt;2) I color my hair regularly. I dry and flat iron  my hair daily and I have no split ends to speak of. It is important to note I have been \\&quot;growing my hair out\\&quot; for some time now and I&#x27;ve lost track when I had my last trim. Necessity usually dictates I do this to keep the ends looking good but now I just need to decide how long do I want to go. :o)&lt;br /&gt;3) No static electricity no matter how much I brush. (I also recommend Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply Ion Leave-in Conditioner.)&lt;br /&gt;4) I believe this brush helps distribute my hair&#x27;s natural oil because my hair feels softer and looks shiner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this brush!</li>
            <li> This is the best brush ever. I am a woman of color with natural hair and have so many hair textures on my head. On top of all of this,there are areas where my hair is thicker and coarser than others. This brush feels so good on my scalp and is made very well considering others I have bought and broken in the past. Great brush and will buy shampoo brush next. It arrived in the time promised and in it&#x27;s original packaging.</li>
            <li> Came just as promised...actually it came really quick...two days later I had the brush...I was using a brush I got through Moroccan Oil, this is much better. Can actually see the result while blow drying</li>
            <li> Great styling tool for my natural hair</li>
            <li> I have been using Denman brushes for about 35 years.  The quality is as good as it was back then.  I think it&#x27;s the best brush on the market.</li>
            <li> I am a natural girl and i LOVEEE using this on my wet hair to detangle and smooth out my ends. I would of course never use it on dry or even lightly dampened curly curly hair. But it does wonders and really allows each curl to be defined and curled. it&#x27;s sturdy and feels like it will never break ever...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS: the denman gold lettering has began to smudge off :( i liked that little added decoration. haha</li>
            <li> Have used this brush for over 20 years and it was still wonderful... but I lost it!!! Replacement just as good :)</li>
            <li> I read many reviews about this brush prior to purchasing. I have spent tons of money on other brushes that just ended up pulling my hair out after 6 months of use. I am so glad I purchased this. I bought one for me and my daughter and she loves it as well!</li>
            <li> The Best Hair Brush for my Natural 4c/4d hair.  Great quality and very sturdy!</li>
            <li> The component the bristles stick into moves in and out of the handset when I brush my hair which makes it difficult to brush my hair continuously.</li>
            <li> Always a great brush! And a great price!</li>
            <li> This brush is great! I have natural thick curls and this brush can handle my hair just fine. In the shower or out it doesn&#x27;t take much effort to detangle my hair with this brush. I was considering getting one of those alternated bristle brushes, but I won&#x27;t have any other brush to my hair now. Great buy, great product.</li>
            <li> I bought this brush from Sally&#x27;s because I saw it on a few YouTube videos &amp; I liked the bristles on the brush. I didn&#x27;t know the name of the brush but thought I could find it at Sally&#x27;s just by the bristles &amp; I sure enough did. It wasn&#x27;t the same color I kept seeing on the videos but it dang sure had the bristles I was looking for. When I watched another video I heard the girl say \\&quot;my denman brush\\&quot; &amp; I said with enthusiasm \\&quot;I DID GET THE RIGHT ONE, ITS JUST ALL BLACK!!\\&quot; Lol, this brush is AMAZING!! I just â™¥ brushing my hair in sections when its wet after I grease/oil my scalp because it feels so good against it. I have 3c/4a natural hair &amp; I plan on probably getting the paddle brush for when my hair is in a wrap, if I can prove that the nylon pins won&#x27;t come off of it like a different brand did, if not I can keep this 9-row heavy one because it is super easy to clean with just hot water &amp; my nails against the rubber pad.</li>
            <li> honestly, this brush is the truth!!! it really does work wonders in de-tangling my hair.  let me just say that i have very thick course natural hair and i use to to break combs and brushes in the past. so this particular brush (heavy weight), is heavy, which means it can handle my thick hair and the bristles doesn&#x27;t damage my hair.  everyone must get this brush if you have thick, natural hair.</li>
            <li> I have below-shoulder-length curly hair - and lots of it. This brush is sturdy enough to power-stroke through roots to end without separating from the handle and without losing bristles. Very happy with this brush.</li>
            <li> 2015 Mistress Susan Secret Stuff Awards Winner for Best Detangling Brush. I use this brush on my wet, coily hair. It is very sturdy and it doesn&#x27;t pull my thick hair. No bristle has broken off either.</li>
            <li> This is my 2nd brush. I bought this one because it was heavy weight handle.  I like the weight and feel of this brush.</li>
            <li> When I was thinking about buying this brush I thought people were just giving hype for just a regular brush so I went to walmart and bought a similar brush for the same price as this but it felt a bit hard on my hair so I decided to finally ordered this one nd like most of the other reviews I took four teeth out of this and also four teeth out of my goodly brush and the denman brushed my hair with a lot ease than my goodly. My cousin who is a guy and had absolutely bo idea abt comb or even the brand also said he prefers using the denman over my other brush so all in all you will not regret buying this brush if you have a very thick hair</li>
            <li> Once you have purchased a Denman brush you will probably never purchase another brand. It&#x27;s great for curls and detangling. I swear by mine.</li>
            <li> This is hands down the best brush I have ever used! I have thick, curly hair which makes it more difficult to find strong grooming products. The bristles are every strong and do not break. The flexible bristles also make it easy to clean. I know that I will have this brush for a very long time. I highly recommend this brush!</li>
            <li> I love this Denman Brush!!!  I had a small purse like Denman Brush and I found it to work perfect on short hair.  As my natural hair grew and became thicker and more fuller . . . I needed a Heavy Weight Denman Brush. AWESOME BRUSH!!!</li>
            <li> This brush is much heavier than it looks. I bought several other Denmans&#x27; and this one is a good one too.</li>
            <li> Detangles my hair gently and efficiently. Feels good on my scalp, will definitely buy more.</li>
            <li> Quality made in UK brush with substantial heft. Made in UK is impressive when most items are from China. I&#x27;d like a weightier handle to balance out the heft of the brush head. The light handle and heavy weight brush are unbalanced in my hand. With my short hair thin hair the &amp;#34;Smooth, round-ended pins for gentle, snag-free styling&amp;#34; do dig into my my scalp more than my last brush that had larges pin ends. This is a high quality and well made brush from the UK. This and other Denman products from Amazon have arrived in open packaging and appear to be returns or old stock. I was surprised with the condition since most items from Amazon.com (versus third party sellers) arrive in excellent condition.</li>
            <li> Just as advertised. No problems at all.</li>
            <li> Completely satisfied. Didn&#x27;t even realize I was ordering the &#x27;heavy weight&#x27; model, but I&#x27;m so glad I did because that was the exact reason I was ordering another denman; because the handle on my previous one had broken off. Although this model is a little heavier than the regular 9-row denman it is well worth it if you have really thick, curly, Afro textured hair. I often use my denman on wet hair which clumps my curls together, putting significant more strain on the brush. This brush is holding up well. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t even know what a Denman brush was until a month ago. This is an excellent product for my thick/nappy hair.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery. Good product</li>
            <li> I somehow lost my Denman and was desperate! I have been using a Denman for over 20 years! So glad I found it on Amazon and was able to get another one for less than in the local beauty supply.  Because it&#x27;s nylon rather than plastic, you don&#x27;t get the static you would from other products and the rubber head the bristles are in create &amp;#34;give&amp;#34; rather than tearing through your hair.  Wet or dry, LOVE, LOVE, LOVE my Denman!!</li>
            <li> I am a guy growing my hair to donate it and just needed something that wouldn&#x27;t fall apart on me like the pieces I saw at the super market.</li>
            <li> heavy but still handy. it is good for styling and brushing my hair. easy to clean and wash. for me, it is perfect.</li>
            <li> I have natural hair (I don&#x27;t believe in categorizing A, B, C etc) but my hair is very thick. My hair was eating all of the paddle brushes I was buying (goody, con air, etc). I have been using this brush 4 months strong and It is still in 1 sturdy piece. Would recommend!</li>
            <li> I love this brush.  The last Denman brush I had was very light weight and kept flying out of my hand while I was styling or blow drying.  This sucker has weight to it and I am not worried about losing it.  I am African American so I need a good brush when I am detangling and washing my hair.  My last one also melted so I am hoping this one can withstand the heat.  So far I am loving it.  hopefully this one will last years instead of months.</li>
            <li> Great brush for LONG HAIR --- of which I am lacking... I find that one of those curves brushes works better for my short hair. Heavy weighted brush is designed great for pulling through long thick hair.</li>
            <li> Great  hair brush for any type of hair :  )</li>
            <li> My hair has never felt so stimulated. The way these prongs run across your scalp is enough to write a book rivaling 50 shades of grey. This little guy will blow your mind and leave you sex and satisfied.</li>
            <li> Great detangler.  Use gently.</li>
            <li> I cant say enough how happy i am about this brush, I love love love it. If you want a brush to last and give your a nice feeling on every stroke of the way, this is it.</li>
            <li> I love this brush, it detangles and smooths my natural hair perfectly in preparation for styling. It is strong and sturdy and clearly very well made. I live on the island of Barbados and I was shocked by how quickly it arrived and the fact that the supplier shipped it directly to me. It is not to be used on very wet hair though, damp is fine but it might rip some hair out if it is too wet. However, once you moisturize well and take your time with the brush, it shouldn&#x27;t rip your hair out and I see no reason why you wouldn&#x27;t love it.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I have been buying Denman Brushes for close to 30 years and nothing compares to their quality.</li>
            <li> I kept reading reviews on this and hearing a lot about it on black hair websites. My hair is kinky curly, soft, short ( from big chop 9 months ago) I am so glad I purchased this! Even though my hair is short I decided to purchase the 9 row heavy duty so that I could remove every other row and have 5 remaining rows so it could comb through my hair with ease and boy does it comb through nicely! I wanted just one brush and a heavy duty one so I don&#x27;t have to purchase another in the future so buying a 9 row to change it to a 5 row and eventually adding them back once my hair gets longer is a great investment! I recommend using it through really wet hair and combing through deep conditioned hair, it gets through all the tangles in a breeze!</li>
            <li> I have used Denman brushes since the late 70&#x27;s :) I have tried other brands, but I am done with that because, in my opinion, this is the best brush on the market for my long, curly/very wavy hair. It does not break my hair nor does it tangle my hair in the bristles. I also like that the bristles are stiff as they give a nice massage while brushing. The other aspect of this brand is that you can take the brush apart for a super thorough cleaning if need be and it lasts a LONG time so well worth the initial investment. I hope this helps anyone wondering about this brand of brush.</li>
            <li> This is The Best Brush I have ever owned...Its heavy and I just love it.You can&#x27;t buy a bush like this at any store It may cost extra but it is worth every cent.</li>
            <li> This one is good and heavy, hopefully this one won&#x27;t break</li>
            <li> My daughter is very tender headed and this brush has made both of our lives more enjoyable during hair time!!!  But I must say that it does accumulate a lot of the dead hair, so it is essential to keep cleaning it.  I got the Denman brush cleaner which works perfectly.</li>
            <li> I wanted to like this brush. I tried multiple times because&lt;br /&gt;of the glowing reviews this brush received by other Naturally&lt;br /&gt;kinky textured ladies on youtube. I thought maybe the brush was&lt;br /&gt;helping to release shed hair, until I switched back to my large&lt;br /&gt;wide-toothed combed and experienced less hair loss. Tried again,&lt;br /&gt;and again, to only experience painful breaking and pulling of my hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a super mixed range of hair, mostly 4b/4c, however within&lt;br /&gt;there are 3c and 4a hair textures, and well as just some spots of&lt;br /&gt;loosely textured &amp;#34;frizz&amp;#34; with no curl near my forehead and crown.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried removing every other row, I tried only using 3 rows, I tried 5,&lt;br /&gt;and the results stayed the same. Hair breakage. I tried using it in the&lt;br /&gt;shower with soaking wet hair and conditioner, damp hair with leave-in, but&lt;br /&gt;NOPE! This wasn&#x27;t the brush for me.  I&#x27;ll stick with my wide-toothed comb&lt;br /&gt;and finger detangling and keep my hair. Ultimately, after 9 months of attempts,&lt;br /&gt;this brush found itself in the trash. And it was a really expensive brush.&lt;br /&gt;I do have to say it is a sturdy brush and it cleansed easily because of the removable&lt;br /&gt;base and rows. However, this brush just wasn&#x27;t for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;:(</li>
            <li> So glad I decided to purchase this. It&#x27;s great for de-tangling  and smoothing the hair.</li>
            <li> Great Brush... You can use it on wet or dry hair.  Love the weight that it has to it.  It can brush through anything!</li>
            <li> Years ago an old friend gave me my first Denman brush. It evidently wore out. I looked around town for a replacement and they were very expensive. I was very pleased to find this product via Amazon and now I have one brush and will soon be buying a spare.</li>
            <li> I had so many brushes it was ridiculous but now that I have this one i tossed majority of the others. My stylist used this on my hair at the salon, so i purchased one for personal use. Im very happy with this brush. i highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Instant curls for medium to long hair...</li>
            <li> Best brush for super long and thick hair.&lt;br /&gt;I have used this product for over 30 years.&lt;br /&gt;I use it in my salon</li>
            <li> Its advertised as static resistant, and they weren&#x27;t kidding.  The brush is surprisingly heavy but this, as it turns out is a superior design.  Well worth the cost.</li>
            <li> My daughter Loves this brush. Makes brushing her curly hair so much easier. Defines her curls!</li>
            <li> My hair is natural. And this brush has saved my life. I used to struggle with regular brushes for countless hours. And mt ponytail would still look bad. But with this brush, I am able to get a nice ponytail without all of the harsh brushing and pulling.</li>
            <li> The brush is very nice and easy to clean, but, as it says it is Heavy Weight......I misunderstood THAT statement!!  This brush is heavy!!!  It would be perfect if it were lighter.</li>
            <li> Strong Bristles, heavy handle and a good price!  What more could you ask?  I had one of these for 15 years and it finally started to wear out so I looked and looked for another one.  Glad I found it on Amazon!</li>
            <li> This brush makes detangling my daughters thick curly hair a breeze! My daughter&#x27;s hair had broken many brushes and combs but this brush is sturdy enough for that not to happen.</li>
            <li> I ordered this and it was a Denman FAKE, I mean c&#x27;mon really? I guess everyone is trying to get a buck.</li>
            <li> Heavy weight handle is not worth the additional cost over normal Denman handle, for me.  I&#x27;ve owned these types of Denman brushes with the regular handles for years, and they never fail at the black handle.  After extensive use, either the white plastic bristles start to break or the pink rubber degenerates.  I still prefer the Denman ones over others, because the bristle tips are smooth, nicely rounded and gentler to one&#x27;s scalp than cheaper ones.</li>
            <li> Bristles are too stiff and sharp for my head.  But good weight and quality brush if a stiff bristle is your preference.</li>
            <li> The best for any type of hair weather it be styling or defining curls or detangling love it and want more</li>
            <li> I have the heavy-weight 9-row brush. It is heavy, but I wouldn&#x27;t say it makes brushing or blowdrying my hair more difficult. In fact, I think it encourages softer brushing since you can sort of let gravity take control instead of ripping the brush through your hair. For blowdrying, the brush provides plenty of tension for blowdrying, and does a good job of reaching the scalp. Overall this is a really great brush and I look forward to years of use!</li>
            <li> I purchased it for my husband for the the holidays.  He hasn&#x27;t seen it yet, but I am sure he will like it.</li>
            <li> This purchase was replacement for a smaller size Denman lost during travel some time ago and endless searches turned up nothing.  This brush is flexible, washable, dries quickly, comfortable to use, good for gentle scalp massage, and certainly  composed of hygienic materials.  Great find!</li>
            <li> I have used Denman brushes for 25+ years.  I decided to our purchase a new one and the tips are hard HARD and it hurts and snags my hair.  The older Denman brush&#x27;s (exact same one) tips are much more pliable and was always so comfortable.  I understand that the company recently was sold so I am guessing they are cutting corners.  Such a shame - used to be the best brush ever.</li>
            <li> I love the weight and feel of the brush. Also, it works well for my hair. I will purchase again.</li>
            <li> This is the best damn brush ever! Eases tangles, massages my scalp, it&#x27;s easy to clean and is not expensive. This is one hard working brush.</li>
            <li> The weight is noticeable but the bristles feel so good on the scalp. This brush was recommended by my stylist and I love it! It was also at a good price on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I love this brush &amp; have used Denman Brushes for years &amp; haven&#x60;t found anything better, although I have tried others in between.</li>
            <li> These brushes last for years and years. Great brush, but not if you want baby soft bristles. This is firm and great for long, straight hair. Holds up to hairdryer heat with no problem.</li>
            <li> I recently bought my second Denman hairbrush. I purchased the first in a neighborhood beauty supply store about twenty years ago. Yes, twenty years ago! Only recently a couple of the bristles broke off and a couple others wanted to recede into the rubber bed. So I splurged and bought a replacement --- it&#x27;s of the very same quality and I expect it will last another twenty years. This is an outstanding hairbrush for anyone with thick hair. (Mine is also long and slightly wavy, not at all kinky or curly.) Natural bristle brushes are aesthetically pleasing, but utterly useless on thick hair. In fact, &amp;#34;on&amp;#34; is the right word --- they simply cannot penetrate into the hair. And forget cheap brushes with plastic handles that break in two, followed by that distinctive &amp;#34;plop&amp;#34; as the head splashes down in the toilet. I feel a bit silly leaving such a long review for --- of all things --- a hairbrush, but it really is an outstanding product.</li>
            <li> I finally broke down and got a Denman Brush. The Denman is a high quality brush and well worth the investment. I grew up using a brush so it&#x27;s not something I&#x27;m opposed to using. I love the way this detangles and had my curls poppin&#x27;. I can&#x27;t recall, since I&#x27;ve been natural, being able to see the different curls patterns I have. I did modify the brush and remove every other row, it definitely made detangling my kinky hair easier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this brush!</li>
            <li> Love this brush&lt;br /&gt;It is well made and works very well on long hair&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this brush for a long time and got this one for my daughter and she is happy with it!</li>
            <li> This brush lives to it&#x27;s weight description. It feels well-built and feels comfortable in your hands. The &amp;#34;smooth, round-edged pins&amp;#34; are not so gentle on my scalp. I can&#x27;t comb my hair using the handle as that puts too much pressure on the pins which press into my scalp. Instead I have to hold the brush by the head and use it that way so that I can adjust the pressure while combing. The pins are really stiff if you&#x27;re looking for a stiff brush...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I will continue to use this brush, but I think it&#x27;s just okay.</li>
            <li> Best brushes ever!  I&#x27;ve been using Denman brushes for 3/4 of my life.  Bought my first in the late 70&#x27;s from my stylist.  I&#x27;m just glad to have hair still, really.  I bought this brush for my son because they are almost impossible to find anywhere else.</li>
            <li> Works well with natural hair.</li>
            <li> I like the brush, it does the job of detangling.  I should have gone for a smaller one for my short hair though.</li>
            <li> The most awesome brush EVER! Makes hair super smooth and shiny when blow drying. It is also great for distributing conditioners and other products through my super curly, super thick (3c/4a) hair. No brush has ever been able to accomplish this without getting stuck or ripping out my hair.</li>
            <li> My daughter now can stand me to comb her hair.  This is a great brush.  Wish I had purchased it years ago.  Would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I love this brush, and I was so happy I could get it on line and did not have to go looking for it in the stores. It is a great feeling when I use it.</li>
            <li> I bought this brush after hearing that some had theirs for 20 + years. After the first year, the rubber in mine gave out! It was a good brush but it didn&#x27;t last as I had expected it too. I purchased a Denman as a xmas gift for my sister. It is made out of a harder...more durable rubber and came from Amazon as well. Hers still looks new like the day that we purchased it. The photos of both brushes look the same and the titles are the same but the rubber is different.</li>
            <li> THIS WAS BEFORE MY SECOND PURCHASE: I would recommend this brush to any African American woman. My hair natural and is of course tangled when worn down. This is my go to brush for detangling my hair. I modified the brush by taking out every other row, leaving me with 5 rows. I use it in the shower on my wet hair and I use it when I&#x27;ve sprayed my hair with water. It makes detangling sooooo EASY! No snags at all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I remembered this brush from growing up.....and YEP, it&#x27;s the same as you&#x27;d remember it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***UPDATE 11-03-14*** over three months later and I LOVE this brush still! It makes detangling sooo easy and does NOT snag or tare my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***Update 7-22-15***&lt;br /&gt;Soooo, just got my brush in today and I am completely disappointed. Prefix: I use my brush to detangle in the shower. Because of this the rubber that holds the bristles loosens over time. I won&#x27;t stop detangling in the shower because I have so much less breakage  that it&#x27;s all worth it. This ware and tare causes me to have to purchase again.&lt;br /&gt;So, I have this brush and it just is NOT the same brush. They&#x27;ve taken this brush from having 22 bristles in each row to only 11 in each row. Changing that is a HUGE difference!!! I have a lot of hair and I need those &amp;#34;fingers&amp;#34; going through it when detangling. The bristles are longer on the new brush but they almost look like they&#x27;re made of a different type of plastic, not a sturdy. I am sooo dissappointed. I haven&#x27;t used it, but will give it a try. I guess I will have to go to a nearby Sally&#x27;s beauty supply to ensure I get what I want :-(</li>
            <li> Perfect brush for curly to kinky hair. It is great to use on my wet or dry hair. My cousin, a natural hair stylist, recommended it and I couldn&#x27;t be happier. It doesn&#x27;t pull but miraculously gets the knots out. Spread the word about this brush!</li>
            <li> I thought this would have been a good detangling tool for my natural hair but i thought wrong. I modified the brush by taking out every other row of the brush and i still couldn&#x27;t get it through my hair. I rather stick to my wide tooth comb. This brush almost ripped my hair out even when i was detangling with loads of conditioner in my hair.</li>
            <li> I have been using a Denman brush for about 25 years now on the recommendation from a friend, they are the best.  They don&#x27;t tangle in your hair, even when using while blow drying.  I&#x27;m sure I will continue to use for the next 25+ years.</li>
            <li> This is a great brush. I have thick, curly hair and it worked!</li>
            <li> i was curious about the fuss of a denman brush , so i researced it .to my surprise amazon have all my needs . when my Denman came i was in the middle of doing my thich curly hair. when i first brushed though my hair i almost didnt want to finish it because this is by far the best brush that i have ever ever had in my 44 years of living . a must have for all natural ;choose your style</li>
            <li> I love this brush very much it is very well built, sturdy and durable. I plan on purchasing another again.</li>
            <li> I have owned this brand for 20 years now and was afraid they had stopped making the heavy duty version as all I could find was a much cheaper one in the stores. Was I ever glad to see it here and YES it is the same one I have had for 20 years. It is my 4th one and the only problems I&#x27;ve ever had is that the handle broke on 2 of my first ones (which fit perfectly in my purse without the handle so not that big a problem) and that my husband likes to take it, use it and put it away in his drawer. Had to get him one of his own. They last for about 10 years before the rubber starts to break down. Absolutly love this brush. Very easy to keep clean. Ordered 2 so I will never have to worry about finding it again (hopefully). 20 more years of use to go.</li>
            <li> News flash...A great brush and it&#x27;s NOT made in China. I know, hard to believe. Easy to clean system. You can remove the bristles for cleaning.</li>
            <li> I have had a different model Denman for 15 years and it was looking so old and ratty that I wanted to replace it.  I have been very pleased with the 9-row brush.  The heft of this brush is really amazing and it is great for getting through thick or curly hair.  I highly recommend this brush or any other Denman brush.</li>
            <li> This is my third Denman in 30 years.  They last a very long time, are easy to clean and untangle my hair with the first stroke.  I&#x27;ve bought look-a-likes, but they don&#x27;t hold up longer than a year and the rubber base cracks and you have to buy another one.  I am so happy that Amazon is out there where I can buy hard to find items like the Denman Brush.  Love it!</li>
            <li> I have never owned a good hairbrush in my life. This was money well spent. Next time I may spend a little more on the Denman brush. I went right through my thick 4/c hair; I was absolutely amazed! I recommend to all.</li>
            <li> There simply isn&#x27;t a better brush on the market. It&#x27;s tried and true.  It stimulates hair growth, decreases static and frizz in the hair because of the red rubber material, great for the toughest of tangles. The very best features are it&#x27;s construction. It&#x27;s ingenious! My mother has had the same denman for over ten years. It&#x27;s basically indestructible. Unless you torch it lol! Every single piece in this brush is removable for sterilization.  I&#x27;d mourn greatly if denman ever stopped making this brush. I use the heavy duty one as my hair is very thick; that one is black and white but this is perfect for medium thick to fine hair. Get a denman. Every house should have one, especially mixed race children. Parents you&#x27;ll bless the day you purchased it!</li>
            <li> Best brush for curly hair</li>
            <li> Less hair loss after shampoo or wet n go style</li>
            <li> I read about this brush in a magazine - a dermatologist was saying that she used this on her hair every night.  When I received it, I was stunned at its weight...that handle is solid metal.  The bristles are very stiff BUT, I have never had a brush make my scalp feel the way this one does.  I am someone who likes the feel of pressure on my scalp and after running this brush all over it (over the sides, underneath, over the top) my scalp has never felt so good! If your scalp is tender, this may not be the brush for you, if you like scalp massages, etc, this is the brush for you. You also can&#x27;t beat the price.  I might even be giving this to all my friends for Christmas.  I don&#x27;t think I would use this to style my hair as I&#x27;m blow drying, but it works beautifully when I&#x27;m brushing hair oil through as an overnight conditioner. Totally worth it!</li>
            <li> my hair is super thick and curly, I&#x27;ve gone natural in the last year and this is probably the best product i purchased</li>
            <li> This is the original Denman Brush.  I got it to supplement a 20 year old one that I still use every day.</li>
            <li> Detangles well enough. I get the same result with a wide tooth comb.</li>
            <li> Best brush for most uses back in the sixties......still is.  The nine row has a solid handle giving it more weight and allowing the brush to do the work rather than the user forcing it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s all about the brush! I can&#x27;t stop brushing my hair!  I just got this brush after reviewing all of the positive reviews on Amazon, and I just love love love this brush!  It massages my scalp, detangles my hair, no snags, no snarled.  I had another brush I had for about 10 years with nylon bristles but there is no comparison to the denman brush.  On a scale ofb1 to 10 I give it a 15.</li>
            <li> After I used 3 times with dryer the brush became useless. Looking your announcement picture the Denman Mark is different. In your picture the crowne is above Denmark mark; in mine the crowne on in the left besides Denman mark with R of trademark. Is those brushes different? Why? Is it fake?</li>
            <li> I USE THIS TO BRUSH MY HAIR IN THE SHOWER AND IT MAKES MY LIFE SO MUCH EASIER. THIS IS MY SECOND BRUSH AND I LIKE THIS ONE BETTER BECAUSE IT HAS A NON SLIP GRIP HANDLE AND IT IS BIGGER</li>
            <li> I have been using this brush for over 20 ears and it is the only one I will use on my wet, baby fine, brittle, straight hair. Less snagging and breakage than with other combs or brushes. Heavy duty version lasts years as it is well made and holds up to years of heavy use. Works great with fine, curly hair as well as on thick, curly or straight hair. I will not use any other brush. Denman boar bristle brushes are also great.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this brush!  I use it primarily to detangle my 3b/3c natural hair and to encourage curl formation for wash and go styling.  I used to own this brush but lost it during a move.  I initially bought an imitation brush to replace it, I figured there couldn&#x27;t be much of a difference between it and the Denman.  I was wrong.  After using the imitation brush 2x, I logged on to Amazon like the sensible woman I am and replaced the pretender with the real thing.  Just be careful, don&#x27;t drag this brush through your hair, be gentle.</li>
            <li> My mom and I love this brush, but I love it the most. I have thick, medium length 4B/C hair. This brush has weight and it is strong. I have used it every day since I received it earlier this week. I brush each quarter-section of my hair with it 50x, there is very little breakage and the brush itself is holding up fabulously. This is the first detangling brush that I have ever used that hasn&#x27;t broken in my hair, even the bristles are still in perfect condition. I used it on my mom&#x27;s hair too and she wants one. I am also buying a few to make care packages for my aunts. I tried looking for this same brush at my local beauty store tonight, and they had nothing by Denman. Not even the local Target, Walmart, Rite Aid, CVS, or Walgreens had it either. I love this brush and it is worth the price to have it. Just for the heck of it, I am getting an extra one for my use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Back to the use. Not only does the Denman Heavy Duty, 9-Row Styling brush successfully detangle my hair, but I have seen less breakage and hair loss using it these last few days than any comb or brush I have used before. The massage it gives my scalp is invigorating and delightful,. I continue to feel the tingling sensations for 30-60 minutes after. The design evenly distributes oil to every strand of hair, and the strong-non scratchy- bristles uplift any dandruff from the scalp, relieving itching. After using, my hair is SO much easier to manage. I&#x27;m between hair styles right now, so I am just safety braiding my hair in quarters at night after scalp treating, hair conditioning, and brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If brushing my hair and braiding it every night will make it grow longer, I will do it as long as this brush continues to be manufactured. My goal is to grow my hair past my shoulder blades. Right now, it reaches a little more than half way down the back of my neck.  Thanks to my current hair products (Fantasia Naturals Tea Tree Oil line, and an essential oil mixture (Tea Tree Oil, Peppermint Oil, Aloe Vera Oil) with a Fractionated Coconut Oil base) and this brush, I have found myself needing to wash my hair less and less. I used to have to wash it once or twice a week due to excessive dandruff and itching (drying the hair strands and my scalp excessively), now I have been able to reduce it to once a month and my hair stays clean. My hair has never been healthier and I am seeing less split ends. Thanks to this brush, I don&#x27;t need combs for anything other than making parts. I am so glad I will never see a 3&amp;#34; hair ball again.</li>
            <li> I bought this brush after my smaller 7 row brush broke at the neck after 4 years of service. This brush is nice and heavy and I am sure I will not experience the break. I use it primarily to blow dry my hair and detangle after washing.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my girlfriend 2 days ago. We received it today. My girlfriend is currently in our bathroom drying her hair while using this brush and keeps stopping the hair dryer to tell me her thoughts.. This is a live account of her feedback&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;The handle is just too small. My hand is cramping. This is very upsetting to me&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;I need a brush with a larger rounder handle&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;The bristles glide really nicely through my hair but the handle is just too small&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;Me: &amp;#34;Babe, lets just return it.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;I dont think we can do that. Let me just finish here and I&#x27;ll decide&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;*Finishes*&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;I mean its a good brush with the bristles and the top, but the handle is too small it hurts. Especially when you&#x27;re holding it for a long time to blow dry your hair&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So there you have it. It&#x27;s a good brush but the handle is just too small.</li>
            <li> Love this brush!  This is a replacement for one I had for maybe 8+ years?  Handle finally broke - snapped actually.  Very heavy duty and can easily go through a good amount of hair - more likely to rip your hair out before brush gives out.&lt;br /&gt;I blow dry my long medium curly hair straight with this one and love how it feels on my head (nice little head massage as the bristles are strong too).  Also love this brush to just smooth my hair back out after wind blown etc.  I purchased the lighter weight version and that is not for me - this one is good for a thick head of hair.</li>
            <li> For the naturally kinky women out there, please be sure that you use plenty conditioner (or your product of choice) that has great slip to it. I haven&#x27;t done the whole &#x27;remove every other row&#x27; trick yet, but if there isn&#x27;t a lot of conditioner in my hair then I KNOW there will be some snapping. Women with loose curls/waves will have no problem with this brush as-is. I love to use it for detangling, which is why I should have a lot of conditioner in my hair anyway. Anyway, the brush IS good. It also helps with defining if I put my wash and go in a puff. Curls are always popped, haha.</li>
            <li> I love this brush, it is nice and stiff, just what I need for my curly thick hair.  I would recomend it for anyone with thick hair</li>
            <li> This is not working for me personally . My husband uses it+i likes it. I used  when rinsing my hair sometimes. i stopped!!  its hardy heavy brush just is not for regular use for my more very fragile transiting to natural hair.  although i am gentle with my hair, it still ripped my hair out but that bc my hair is  very weak.  over all great quality and for normal healthy hair</li>
            <li> Can NEVER go wrong with the Denman hair styling tools.</li>
            <li> Smooths my curls down and it works great for detangling.</li>
            <li> This is the only brush I use for my hair. I had to replace my old one because the rubber split. I expect I&#x27;ll have to replace this is in another few years as well, but this is THE brush.</li>
            <li> This brush is quite heavy and would be great for thick-ish, long hair since the hair does tend to stay smoothed down once brushed with this.  Maybe even for a man with thick wavy hair (this will be a great gift to someone like this that I have in mind).</li>
            <li> This is the only brush I will use on my daughters hair. It makes detangling so much easier. This is a sturdy brush.</li>
            <li> I love this brush even though I&lt;br /&gt;received it 2 weeks late because&lt;br /&gt;my mail lady forgot to deliver it&lt;br /&gt;but I&#x27;m pleased to say after phoning&lt;br /&gt;my post office 3 different times...&lt;br /&gt;.......I FINALLY got my brush and&lt;br /&gt;it was worth the wait!!!</li>
