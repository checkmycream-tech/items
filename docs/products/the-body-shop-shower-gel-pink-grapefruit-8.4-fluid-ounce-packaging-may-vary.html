            <li> I love the smell of grapefruit and few products</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s either too short for its width, or to wide for its height.  </li>
            <li> is about $4.00 less than a comparable amount if bought at the Body Shop store (especially when factoring in tax).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> At times I&#x27;m lazy and purchase something else at the store or bath and body works, but always come back to this in the end.</li>
            <li> She loves the scent but said it was a bit thin compared to other shower gels she normally uses.</li>
            <li> Very bitter.</li>
            <li> Not a sweet scent like I expected.</li>
            <li> It is sour smelling</li>
            <li> once you get past the chemical smell, it does leave a scent of pink grapefruit -</li>
            <li> Pink grapefruit very hard to find.  </li>
            <li> I love their coconut scent but this scent is nasty</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s too hard for me!</li>
            <li> However, this in-between sized bottle is irritating.  </li>
            <li> Lathers well &amp; doesnt leave a overpowering scent behind.</li>
            <li> Was shocked because I&#x27;ve never had a bad &amp;#34;The Body Shop&amp;#34; item before.</li>

            <li> Great Service and great product.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> I have used this shower gel for years. At times I&#x27;m lazy and purchase something else at the store or bath and body works, but always come back to this in the end. It&#x27;s a great product and I love the light grapefruit scent with just the right amount of moisturizing.</li>
            <li> Love live love this product. It has an amazing fragrance and is one of my shower stables.</li>
            <li> I thought the scent would be refreshing, however, it&#x27;s slightly bitter. Wont reorder this one!</li>
            <li> I love the smell &amp; amount of lather this gel provides.  It&#x27;s right up there with its sister product the Satsuma shower gel,  in my opinion.  However, this in-between sized bottle is irritating.  it&#x27;s either too short for its width, or to wide for its height.  i couldn&#x27;t say exactly which, but it&#x27;s weighted precisely right to always be off-balance in the shower.  On the upside, dropping it on my feet every morning does help me wake up...</li>
            <li> Love the smell of grapefruit!</li>
            <li> Not a sweet scent like I expected. Very bitter. Cancelled my future orders. I love their coconut scent but this scent is nasty</li>
            <li> Does not smell like grapefruit. My family couldn&#x27;t stand the smell, so I had to stop using it. Smells for like cat pee to me, and rotten citrus to everyone else. Was shocked because I&#x27;ve never had a bad &amp;#34;The Body Shop&amp;#34; item before.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my wife.  She loves the scent but said it was a bit thin compared to other shower gels she normally uses.</li>
            <li> Love, love this shower gel. Pink grapefruit very hard to find.  So happy found it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> This body wash is very moisturizing. Has a fresh summer scent that is not too overwhelming. Ordered from Nanna&#x27;s Southern Comfort. Fast delivery. Would definitely order agin.</li>
            <li> once you get past the chemical smell, it does leave a scent of pink grapefruit - but it&#x27;s too hard for me!</li>
            <li> This stuff smells great! I love the smell of grapefruit and few products REALLY have that fresh grapefruit scent. This is absolutely delicous. Thanks!</li>
            <li> I happen to love this scent from Body Shop...but my boyfriend hates it.  He prefers the Satsuma/Clementine orange body wash.  He won&#x27;t use my grapefruit one because he says it &amp;#34;smells sour&amp;#34;...like a grapefruit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I happen to really like it and the price here on Amazon is about $4.00 less than a comparable amount if bought at the Body Shop store (especially when factoring in tax).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t know for sure if you like grapefruit scented things just be mindful that it has a &amp;#34;sour&amp;#34; smell to some people.  I think it&#x27;s invigorating, but that&#x27;s just my opinion.  You can&#x27;t beat the price on this though.</li>
            <li> The smell is wonderful.  The consistency is perfect for only using enough for a shower.  The only problem was the size of the bottle.  Last time I ordered there was a large bottle which was a better value for me.</li>
            <li> Wonderful grapefruit scent and lathers up quite nice, very refreshing.</li>
            <li> This is a refreshing body wash. The only reason I dont give it 5 stars is it could smell a little more grapefruit like &amp; should be a smidge sweet. It is sour smelling but I love it. Lathers well &amp; doesnt leave a overpowering scent behind.</li>
            <li> Love the scent and how clean I feel after using it.  Would like a bit more lather, but even still, I feel clean and the smell is a wonderful pick me up in the mornings.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a fan of grapefruit, but this scent is lovely. Invigorating and clean, makes for a pleasant scent in the shower! Love the body shop!</li>
