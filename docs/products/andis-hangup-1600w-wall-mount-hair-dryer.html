            <li>GREAT dryer for the price...</li>
            <li>It is a great product and does a great job.   </li>

            <li>Also is great to hang in bathroom.</li>
            <li>They work great for a nightlight, have lots of power and are rather compact.</li>
            <li>This is a great hair dryer.</li>

            <li>Great Product.</li>
            <li>Very nice hair blowers.  </li>
            <li>Makes it very handy to use and there is no need for a place to store when you are done.</li>
            <li>Perfect for RV - compact, mounts easily, light a benefit, great price for great product</li>
            <li>wall mounting bracket is great and keeps the dryer conveniently stowed and still looks good.  </li>
            <li>in the beginning it seemed bright</li>
            <li>The nightlight is amazingly bright and suffices on</li>
            <li>She is equally delighted by this dryer&#x27;s speed.</li>
            <li>I found this one and have been delighted with it.</li>
            <li>And the night light is a great plus!</li>
            <li>no need to strech when mounted at optimum hight.</li>
            <li>looks good, but stopped working after 3 months</li>
            <li>The hair dryer is in a bathroom without a window, so the night light is perfect.</li>
            <li>I am delighted with the hang-up feature.</li>
            <li>Works good</li>
            <li>I was very happy with the power and the night light feature is nice also</li>
            <li>Night light is very bright.</li>
            <li>the light may be just a bit too bright, but if you need a nightlight, its&#x27; great.</li>
            <li>Love this!</li>
            <li>I really love it!</li>
            <li>Great product, easy to mount.  </li>
            <li>It works great, has the night light for night in the guest bathroom.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t read the description closely and thought it was the kind of dryer I was replacing that wired into the wall.  </li>
            <li>nice features...</li>
            <li>However, my wife says the heat setting is not that warm so factor that in.  </li>
            <li>This is the best gift my sis says she loves it thanks for this product</li>
            <li>This is the smallest unit of its kind I&#x27;ve seen.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own.  </li>
            <li>Mounts to the wall in it&#x27;s own holder, so</li>
            <li>The nightlight is a nice touch too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So, I was happy to find that they still make this model,  very powerful and doesn&#x27;t clutter  up the bathroom with the wall mount and the way the cord is attached.  </li>
            <li>Good compact hair dryer to mount in the bathroom for easy reach.  </li>
            <li>Very strong drier.</li>
            <li>Dryer works great and it easy to use and the built in night light in really a nice addition.  </li>
            <li>My guests love not having to bring their own on trips to our home.</li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t want to fill screw holes, so I was delighted to find it still available on Amazon.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy storage!</li>
            <li>I have very fine hair</li>
            <li>They are easy to install, work well, and the night light is nice and bright (but not obnoxious).  </li>
            <li>It is a bit bright though as I already purchased one of these a couple of yrs ago and the light was better.</li>
            <li>I originally paid $40.00 and thought that was a high price, but after years of faultless performance, I&#x27;d pay that price again.  </li>
            <li>The dryer itself works fine snd is handy being located on a wall and not in a drawer.</li>
            <li>Now it&#x27;s always handy to grab, and it doubles as a night light.</li>
            <li>A bit of a challenge, but the result looks OK.</li>
            <li>and so we were pleased.    </li>
            <li>If you want something greater than lukewarm air then look at another model.  </li>
            <li>Thanks for a great experience.</li>
            <li>I have owned one of these for over 5 years and couldn&#x27;t be more satisfied.  </li>
            <li>Works okay.</li>
            <li>I substituted a better pair I had sitting around in my toolbox.    </li>
            <li>we love these dryer and glad to find them</li>
            <li>I love this unit.</li>
            <li>Has a night light in handle which is nice.</li>
            <li>but we are both enjoying it.</li>
            <li>We love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks,</li>
            <li>Had to disconnect night light, so bright, could be used as a street light.</li>
            <li>I have used this dryer for many years and decided to purchase another one for travel.  </li>
            <li>The light is a nice feature.</li>
            <li>I have been purchasing Andis hair dryers for many years.</li>
            <li>I have been purchasing this product for more than 10 years.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had dryers that lasted many years</li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s mounted on the wall and out of the way.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;First of all I love the convenience of having it mounted within easy reach.  </li>
            <li>It is a good buy at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>Perfect ARRIVED quickly but thought I ordered 2 only received1</li>
            <li>Easy to attach to bathroom wall.  </li>
            <li>Mounting can be easy depending....</li>
            <li>Compact, easy to hang and reliable.</li>
            <li>All in all, this product does what it is supposed to very well and, despite a couple of one-time installation issues, I am very pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li>This hair dryer was easy to mount to the wall, it&#x27;s light in weight, and  it dries hair.</li>
            <li>It is better than the first because the cord to the wall plug is better designed to run through the hanger.   </li>
            <li>We own a new condo in St. Maarten and because we will be renting it, we felt that having a secure and space saving hair dryer would be most practical yet beneficial to our guests.</li>
            <li>This was just what I was looking for, a hair dryer that hangs up and a night light, the hair dryer works fine, the night light lasted one day,</li>
            <li>but the 2nd was great.</li>
            <li>I liked it so much</li>
            <li>Is there a night light and a hook for hanging the cord up so it doesn&#x27;t lie on the counter?  </li>
            <li>Night light quit working after a week.</li>
            <li>It is a space saver, always ready and handy when you need it and never in the way when you do not need it.</li>
            <li>This wall-mounted hair dryer was the smallest one available, and that is why I selected it.</li>
            <li>The hair dryer still ran, but it filled my hair with the smell of an electrical fire.</li>
            <li>Fabulous - had one before that lasted 9 years.  </li>
            <li>It does not seem nearly as secure.</li>
            <li>The first one lasted about 15 years using two times a day!!</li>
            <li>Very powerful for the size.</li>
            <li>The dryer is very powerful however on the high setting the air is not as warm as I would like.  </li>
            <li>We are enjoying this wall mounted hair dryer very much.</li>
            <li>I blow dry my hair every morning after my shower, works great,   light weight in my hand...</li>
            <li>The dryer is powerful, not extremely noisy, and appears to be of good quality contruction.</li>
            <li>Overall a good product.  </li>
            <li>I have always loved the andis hairdryer but paid thirty some dollars for this and it only lasted couple months</li>
            <li>I find the light is a useful addition and can be turned off by clicking the test button on the power cord.  </li>
            <li>Night light is an added feature that is useful in the bathroom.</li>
            <li>Overall good product though.</li>
            <li>The new blue nightlight is very bright</li>
            <li>I was so impressed with how fast it dried my hair that I bought one and mounted it on the wall in my bathroom at home.</li>
            <li>Had a different brand for five years before, that was perfect, should have re-ordered the same.</li>
            <li>It is better than the old one as this model has an led night light built in.</li>
            <li>They have lasted more than three years and are still running like new.</li>
            <li>This is a great little hair dryer.  </li>
            <li>The ANDIS 30925 Hangup hair dryer is a great little product.  </li>
            <li>It is small but very powerful and dries even the longest hair evenly and quickly with a nice strong flow of air without scorching.  </li>
            <li>Powerful blower.  </li>
            <li>Blow dryer is compact yet powerful.  </li>
            <li>It was okay while it lasted, but just short of two years after I bought it, it won&#x27;t work (the night light still works).  </li>
            <li>Small size, lots of heat and easy mounting, cord length good</li>
            <li>Other than that, it&#x27;s a good hair dryer.</li>
            <li>This one was priced right and it works without all the night lights.</li>
            <li>Was thrilled to find the exact same one.</li>
            <li>Buy this; you&#x27;ll own it for a LONG time.</li>
            <li>It may be better for the hair not to have such hot air, but I do not like drying my hair with only warm air.</li>
            <li>- Fits well in hand and is easily maneuverable  - Puts out high volumes of air at a high-enough temperature  - Very compact; fits in a very small space  - Night light is surprisingly useful; it lights the way to the bathroom without being so bright as to be distracting    </li>
            <li>I first tried this dryer at a time share.</li>
            <li>the image looks exactly like what I had.  </li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>so big fingers may find it challenging.  </li>
            <li>Has a powerful motor in a very compact form.  </li>
            <li>Sure enough, I just checked it out.</li>
            <li>Thanks again!</li>
            <li>So when the first one died, I bought another.</li>
            <li>My wife&#x27;s habit of leaving her non-hanging dryer and tangle of cords all over the sink and vanity motivated me to get a replacement fast!    </li>
            <li>First, the power cord length cannot be adjusted.  </li>
            <li>the enclosed mounting screws and wall anchors are pretty flimsy.  </li>
            <li>When ours stopped working, I was worried that I couldn&#x27;t find them again, so I went on line with Amazan and was pleased to find the same brand.  </li>
            <li>Is much better than larger dryers.</li>
            <li>I went back and bought more for each bathroom.</li>
            <li>the switch quit working and the dryer would get so hot would shut off before</li>
            <li>We first used one in a hotel we stayed</li>
            <li>and my commented that exactly what we need for home.</li>
            <li>Previous one was used every day for over 5 years - exceptional value for money.</li>
            <li>I expect a hair dryer to last more than a year</li>
            <li>This smaller version was easy to mount and just as powerful although a bit noisier.</li>
            <li>While it&#x27;s loud on high, it&#x27;s not bad on low, and I love that it doesn&#x27;t get so hot that it would frazzle your hair (or</li>
            <li>The night light feature is really not something that would really be considered a night light</li>
            <li>The handle design is simple and grasping it is easy.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s powerful for its size and the heat isn&#x27;t blast-furnace hot like my old hair dryer.</li>
            <li>So easy just to grap off the wall instead of searching through drawers for regular hair dryers.</li>
            <li>The dryer is effective enough for guests, but lacks the extra features to make it a first choice dryer.</li>
            <li>Gets the hair dried more quickly than others.  </li>
            <li>The compact handset is easy to maneuver and it puts out a surprisingly high volume of air at the right temperature, which is a must for those with long or extra-thick hair.    </li>
            <li>On high, this thing really BLOWS!</li>
            <li>If you want real heat, this may not be unit for you.</li>
            <li>When you purchase a product, you expect it work for a much longer period of time.</li>
            <li>No need to have a separate night light to take up valuable outlet space (there is never enough outlets in a bathroom).</li>
            <li>The dryer does its job -- drying -- very well.  </li>
            <li>Shipped fast.</li>
            <li>I am updating only because of the night light.</li>
            <li>I really like this item</li>
            <li>It works very well, too --it</li>
            <li>Really like the hairdryer with the wall mount.</li>
            <li>Really like it</li>
            <li>I really like this product because it keeps the dryer in place and organized.  </li>
            <li>Hotel style - very convenient.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I don&#x27;t have to because now the price has really come down.  </li>
            <li>Sometimes it never gets back up to full speed.</li>
            <li>Most recent one only 4 months.  </li>
            <li>The night light is kind of cheesy too.</li>
            <li>The plastic piece that attaches to the wall is cheaper quality that the older dryers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would highly recemmond it.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this dryer.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this unit if you do not mind the noise level.</li>
            <li>is quite powerful for such a petite dryer.</li>
            <li>I purchased two new ones with night lights and just a few days after using the first one the night light didn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li>It was easy to do, took minutes and is a low enough profile to not be in the way.  </li>
            <li>biggest complaint, however, is that this dryer does not blow HOT air, only warm.</li>
            <li>Sold my RV and needed a new one.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t get very hot, take longer to dry hair</li>
            <li>and I really like the hair dryer, but it appears to me that the night light is just not ready for prime time and may actually constitute a fire hazard.</li>
            <li>Low air on the first</li>
            <li>but it IS hot enough.</li>
            <li>This one only has high heat on the high speed, which is very loud.</li>
            <li>Kind of weak.</li>
            <li>I am always running late, so being able to \\&quot;grab and dry\\</li>
            <li>The \\&quot;telephone\\&quot; type cord is rugged and will stretch as far as 10 feet.    </li>
            <li>The only downside is there are no heat settings (at least in the old model I own).</li>
            <li>I think it is because of the very compact design - not enough plastic material to absorb the fan noise.</li>
            <li>Unlike my others, this dryer does not attach to a metal plate that is screwed into the wall, which allows for you to remove the whole thing, if necessary.</li>
            <li>This one attaches directly to the wall with two screws that go through the plastic casing.</li>
            <li>It is a bit noisy due to the high volume of air it moves, but is very fast, compact, and lightweight.</li>
            <li>However, I&#x27;ve used blow dryers for many more years than this, so I am disappointed that it quit working so early.</li>
            <li>There are high and low settings, but that is for the blast of air, not the heat.</li>
            <li>This new hair dryer replaced an older larger model which I had for years and finally packed it in.  </li>
            <li>But after 6 months of normal use it died and I now need a third one.</li>
            <li>The new fans look and works the same way.</li>
            <li>It is a powerful little dryer and dries my hair quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>There are only 2 settings, 1 low and no heat, and 1 high with heat.  </li>
            <li>One finally burned out, and since I could not find the exact one I had previously, I ordered this one.</li>
            <li>Not long after that it died altogether.  </li>
            <li>I love the size and convenience of this dryer for a small bath with little storage.</li>

            <li> Great product, easy to mount.  </li>
            <li> It works great, has the night light for night in the guest bathroom.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t read the description closely and thought it was the kind of dryer I was replacing that wired into the wall.  </li>
            <li> nice features...</li>
            <li> However, my wife says the heat setting is not that warm so factor that in.  </li>
            <li> This is the best gift my sis says she loves it thanks for this product</li>
            <li> This is the smallest unit of its kind I&#x27;ve seen.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s own.  </li>
            <li> Mounts to the wall in it&#x27;s own holder, so</li>
            <li> The nightlight is a nice touch too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So, I was happy to find that they still make this model,  very powerful and doesn&#x27;t clutter  up the bathroom with the wall mount and the way the cord is attached.  </li>
            <li> Good compact hair dryer to mount in the bathroom for easy reach.  </li>
            <li> Very strong drier.</li>
            <li> Dryer works great and it easy to use and the built in night light in really a nice addition.  </li>
            <li> My guests love not having to bring their own on trips to our home.</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t want to fill screw holes, so I was delighted to find it still available on Amazon.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy storage!</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair</li>
            <li> They are easy to install, work well, and the night light is nice and bright (but not obnoxious).  </li>
            <li> It is a bit bright though as I already purchased one of these a couple of yrs ago and the light was better.</li>
            <li> I originally paid $40.00 and thought that was a high price, but after years of faultless performance, I&#x27;d pay that price again.  </li>
            <li> The dryer itself works fine snd is handy being located on a wall and not in a drawer.</li>
            <li> Now it&#x27;s always handy to grab, and it doubles as a night light.</li>
            <li> A bit of a challenge, but the result looks OK.</li>
            <li> and so we were pleased.    </li>
            <li> If you want something greater than lukewarm air then look at another model.  </li>
            <li> Thanks for a great experience.</li>
            <li> I have owned one of these for over 5 years and couldn&#x27;t be more satisfied.  </li>
            <li> Works okay.</li>
            <li> I substituted a better pair I had sitting around in my toolbox.    </li>
            <li> we love these dryer and glad to find them</li>
            <li> I love this unit.</li>
            <li> Has a night light in handle which is nice.</li>
            <li> but we are both enjoying it.</li>
            <li> We love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks,</li>
            <li> Had to disconnect night light, so bright, could be used as a street light.</li>
            <li> I have used this dryer for many years and decided to purchase another one for travel.  </li>
            <li> The light is a nice feature.</li>
            <li> I have been purchasing Andis hair dryers for many years.</li>
            <li> I have been purchasing this product for more than 10 years.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had dryers that lasted many years</li>
            <li> I love that it&#x27;s mounted on the wall and out of the way.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;First of all I love the convenience of having it mounted within easy reach.  </li>
            <li> It is a good buy at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Perfect ARRIVED quickly but thought I ordered 2 only received1</li>
            <li> Easy to attach to bathroom wall.  </li>
            <li> Mounting can be easy depending....</li>
            <li> Compact, easy to hang and reliable.</li>
            <li> All in all, this product does what it is supposed to very well and, despite a couple of one-time installation issues, I am very pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> This hair dryer was easy to mount to the wall, it&#x27;s light in weight, and  it dries hair.</li>
            <li> It is better than the first because the cord to the wall plug is better designed to run through the hanger.   </li>
            <li> We own a new condo in St. Maarten and because we will be renting it, we felt that having a secure and space saving hair dryer would be most practical yet beneficial to our guests.</li>
            <li> This was just what I was looking for, a hair dryer that hangs up and a night light, the hair dryer works fine, the night light lasted one day,</li>
            <li> but the 2nd was great.</li>
            <li> I liked it so much</li>
            <li> Is there a night light and a hook for hanging the cord up so it doesn&#x27;t lie on the counter?  </li>
            <li> Night light quit working after a week.</li>
            <li> It is a space saver, always ready and handy when you need it and never in the way when you do not need it.</li>
            <li> This wall-mounted hair dryer was the smallest one available, and that is why I selected it.</li>
            <li> The hair dryer still ran, but it filled my hair with the smell of an electrical fire.</li>
            <li> Fabulous - had one before that lasted 9 years.  </li>
            <li> It does not seem nearly as secure.</li>
            <li> The first one lasted about 15 years using two times a day!!</li>
            <li> Very powerful for the size.</li>
            <li> The dryer is very powerful however on the high setting the air is not as warm as I would like.  </li>
            <li> We are enjoying this wall mounted hair dryer very much.</li>
            <li> I blow dry my hair every morning after my shower, works great,   light weight in my hand...</li>
            <li> The dryer is powerful, not extremely noisy, and appears to be of good quality contruction.</li>
            <li> Overall a good product.  </li>
            <li> I have always loved the andis hairdryer but paid thirty some dollars for this and it only lasted couple months</li>
            <li> I find the light is a useful addition and can be turned off by clicking the test button on the power cord.  </li>
            <li> Night light is an added feature that is useful in the bathroom.</li>
            <li> Overall good product though.</li>
            <li> The new blue nightlight is very bright</li>
            <li> I was so impressed with how fast it dried my hair that I bought one and mounted it on the wall in my bathroom at home.</li>
            <li> Had a different brand for five years before, that was perfect, should have re-ordered the same.</li>
            <li> It is better than the old one as this model has an led night light built in.</li>
            <li> They have lasted more than three years and are still running like new.</li>
            <li> This is a great little hair dryer.  </li>
            <li> The ANDIS 30925 Hangup hair dryer is a great little product.  </li>
            <li> It is small but very powerful and dries even the longest hair evenly and quickly with a nice strong flow of air without scorching.  </li>
            <li> Powerful blower.  </li>
            <li> Blow dryer is compact yet powerful.  </li>
            <li> It was okay while it lasted, but just short of two years after I bought it, it won&#x27;t work (the night light still works).  </li>
            <li> Small size, lots of heat and easy mounting, cord length good</li>
            <li> Other than that, it&#x27;s a good hair dryer.</li>
            <li> This one was priced right and it works without all the night lights.</li>
            <li> Was thrilled to find the exact same one.</li>
            <li> Buy this; you&#x27;ll own it for a LONG time.</li>
            <li> It may be better for the hair not to have such hot air, but I do not like drying my hair with only warm air.</li>
            <li> - Fits well in hand and is easily maneuverable  - Puts out high volumes of air at a high-enough temperature  - Very compact; fits in a very small space  - Night light is surprisingly useful; it lights the way to the bathroom without being so bright as to be distracting    </li>
            <li> I first tried this dryer at a time share.</li>
            <li> the image looks exactly like what I had.  </li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> so big fingers may find it challenging.  </li>
            <li> Has a powerful motor in a very compact form.  </li>
            <li> Sure enough, I just checked it out.</li>
            <li> Thanks again!</li>
            <li> So when the first one died, I bought another.</li>
            <li> My wife&#x27;s habit of leaving her non-hanging dryer and tangle of cords all over the sink and vanity motivated me to get a replacement fast!    </li>
            <li> First, the power cord length cannot be adjusted.  </li>
            <li> the enclosed mounting screws and wall anchors are pretty flimsy.  </li>
            <li> When ours stopped working, I was worried that I couldn&#x27;t find them again, so I went on line with Amazan and was pleased to find the same brand.  </li>
            <li> Is much better than larger dryers.</li>
            <li> I went back and bought more for each bathroom.</li>
            <li> the switch quit working and the dryer would get so hot would shut off before</li>
            <li> We first used one in a hotel we stayed</li>
            <li> and my commented that exactly what we need for home.</li>
            <li> Previous one was used every day for over 5 years - exceptional value for money.</li>
            <li> I expect a hair dryer to last more than a year</li>
            <li> This smaller version was easy to mount and just as powerful although a bit noisier.</li>
            <li> While it&#x27;s loud on high, it&#x27;s not bad on low, and I love that it doesn&#x27;t get so hot that it would frazzle your hair (or</li>
            <li> The night light feature is really not something that would really be considered a night light</li>
            <li> The handle design is simple and grasping it is easy.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s powerful for its size and the heat isn&#x27;t blast-furnace hot like my old hair dryer.</li>
            <li> So easy just to grap off the wall instead of searching through drawers for regular hair dryers.</li>
            <li> The dryer is effective enough for guests, but lacks the extra features to make it a first choice dryer.</li>
            <li> Gets the hair dried more quickly than others.  </li>
            <li> The compact handset is easy to maneuver and it puts out a surprisingly high volume of air at the right temperature, which is a must for those with long or extra-thick hair.    </li>
            <li> On high, this thing really BLOWS!</li>
            <li> If you want real heat, this may not be unit for you.</li>
            <li> When you purchase a product, you expect it work for a much longer period of time.</li>
            <li> No need to have a separate night light to take up valuable outlet space (there is never enough outlets in a bathroom).</li>
            <li> The dryer does its job -- drying -- very well.  </li>
            <li> Shipped fast.</li>
            <li> I am updating only because of the night light.</li>
            <li> I really like this item</li>
            <li> It works very well, too --it</li>
            <li> Really like the hairdryer with the wall mount.</li>
            <li> Really like it</li>
            <li> I really like this product because it keeps the dryer in place and organized.  </li>
            <li> Hotel style - very convenient.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I don&#x27;t have to because now the price has really come down.  </li>
            <li> Sometimes it never gets back up to full speed.</li>
            <li> Most recent one only 4 months.  </li>
            <li> The night light is kind of cheesy too.</li>
            <li> The plastic piece that attaches to the wall is cheaper quality that the older dryers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would highly recemmond it.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this dryer.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this unit if you do not mind the noise level.</li>
            <li> is quite powerful for such a petite dryer.</li>
            <li> I purchased two new ones with night lights and just a few days after using the first one the night light didn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li> It was easy to do, took minutes and is a low enough profile to not be in the way.  </li>
            <li> biggest complaint, however, is that this dryer does not blow HOT air, only warm.</li>
            <li> Sold my RV and needed a new one.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t get very hot, take longer to dry hair</li>
            <li> and I really like the hair dryer, but it appears to me that the night light is just not ready for prime time and may actually constitute a fire hazard.</li>
            <li> Low air on the first</li>
            <li> but it IS hot enough.</li>
            <li> This one only has high heat on the high speed, which is very loud.</li>
            <li> Kind of weak.</li>
            <li> I am always running late, so being able to \\&quot;grab and dry\\</li>
            <li> The \\&quot;telephone\\&quot; type cord is rugged and will stretch as far as 10 feet.    </li>
            <li> The only downside is there are no heat settings (at least in the old model I own).</li>
            <li> I think it is because of the very compact design - not enough plastic material to absorb the fan noise.</li>
            <li> Unlike my others, this dryer does not attach to a metal plate that is screwed into the wall, which allows for you to remove the whole thing, if necessary.</li>
            <li> This one attaches directly to the wall with two screws that go through the plastic casing.</li>
            <li> It is a bit noisy due to the high volume of air it moves, but is very fast, compact, and lightweight.</li>
            <li> However, I&#x27;ve used blow dryers for many more years than this, so I am disappointed that it quit working so early.</li>
            <li> There are high and low settings, but that is for the blast of air, not the heat.</li>
            <li> This new hair dryer replaced an older larger model which I had for years and finally packed it in.  </li>
            <li> But after 6 months of normal use it died and I now need a third one.</li>
            <li> The new fans look and works the same way.</li>
            <li> It is a powerful little dryer and dries my hair quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> There are only 2 settings, 1 low and no heat, and 1 high with heat.  </li>
            <li> One finally burned out, and since I could not find the exact one I had previously, I ordered this one.</li>
            <li> Not long after that it died altogether.  </li>
            <li> I love the size and convenience of this dryer for a small bath with little storage.</li>
            <li> Blows hard and hot if needed.</li>
            <li> I have owned two of these and both didn&#x27;t last long.  </li>
            <li> The relatively minor disadvantages have to do with the installation.  </li>
            <li> I could hear that the fan had started to struggle, so I was not surprised when it died.  </li>
            <li> Hope this one lasts as long.  </li>
            <li> The small size makes it a little noisier than a larger one, but all the other convienances make this worth it for me.</li>
            <li> The night light on the second unit again immediately failed, although without the odor of the other one.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately that was high speed which was such a loud pitch, it hurt our ears to use it.  </li>
            <li> The mounting bracket is barely wider than the dryer, which makes putting it into tight places a snap.    </li>
            <li> I thought the hanger would have a plug, but no, the dryer had the plug and a very long cord.  </li>
            <li> could get my hair dry</li>
            <li> Installed this in a guest bath with limited counter and storage space about 4 months ago.  </li>
            <li> Hope to have the second set as long as the previous one.</li>
            <li> My wife likes the power of this small dryer, but if you ask me they seem a bit on the loud side.  </li>
            <li> My previous wall-mounted hair dryer was a Sunbeam that I bought at Phar Mor about 15 years ago, before it finally died.</li>
            <li> Be careful that you are selecting what you want.  </li>
            <li> I use it everyday and my last one lasted me 3-4 years.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, I would like to see the nightlight go back to a softer Green color.  </li>
            <li> Sadly, it was not heavily used - I usually air dry my long hair and my husband has short hair that takes all of 5 minutes to dry if that.  </li>
            <li> so it was never used for long periods of time and didn&#x27;t have to work hard to dry my hair.</li>
            <li> It is one continuous cord from the bottom of handset, through the mounting bracket, and down to the GFCI power plug.  </li>
            <li> We eventully bought a picture frame, put scrapbook paper in it and bolted the dryer mounting to the frame and the frame to the wall to cover the previous dryer&#x27;s footprint.  </li>
            <li> The dryer&#x27;s base is small enough that it fits in the narrow area between the medicine cabinet and an outside corner of the wall, which is why I chose this particular blow dryer.  </li>
            <li> , It&#x27;s beyond producr return time, so I cannot return and waste of money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve thrown away the box and won&#x27;t go to the trouble to return it, but I will replace it as soon as I find another.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re looking for something efficient, practical and convenient, this is the little dryer for you!</li>
            <li> This dryer is small, compact and has plenty of power.</li>
            <li> Would recommend this to anyone needing a small hair dryer.</li>
            <li> It fits perfectly in a small space, and it is as inconspicuous as a wall-mounted dryer could be.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why they dont make a 1800w model.</li>
            <li> The new unit came with a novel night-light feature, which failed immediately, leaving an unpleasant smell of burnt plastic and an oily black soot deposit on the handle.</li>
            <li> I really hated the night light, though, which seemed to bathe the bathroom in an eerie, green glow, so I put a piece of duct tape over it and that helped.  </li>
            <li> I have been disappointed in the last few years because I&#x27;ve had two of them burn up.  </li>
            <li> This one plugs in to an outlet and it has been a challenge to mount since the footprint of the base is smaller than the one I had previously.  </li>
            <li> The switch is up almost against the blower body and very small in footprint</li>
            <li> As of December, although been doing this for about 2 months now, the hair dryer puts off a spark when the switch is flipped and it starts off real slow and slowly builds up speed.</li>
            <li> I have wanted a hang up hair dryer for years and thought they were too expensive for me.  </li>
            <li> Too bad they don&#x27;t make hair dryers as well as they make the Andis clippers I&#x27;ve used for years as a dog groomer.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed with this dryer.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Low air on the first but the 2nd was great. It is in the guest bath so know one evr has to pack the monster blow dryer.</li>
            <li> We had this dryer for 1 year before it died.  Sadly, it was not heavily used - I usually air dry my long hair and my husband has short hair that takes all of 5 minutes to dry if that.  Initially it defaulted to just one speed.  Unfortunately that was high speed which was such a loud pitch, it hurt our ears to use it.  Not long after that it died altogether.  I&#x27;ll try another wall mounted dryer, just not Andis.  Too bad they don&#x27;t make hair dryers as well as they make the Andis clippers I&#x27;ve used for years as a dog groomer.</li>
            <li> I first tried this dryer at a time share. I was so impressed with how fast it dried my hair that I bought one and mounted it on the wall in my bathroom at home. Now it&#x27;s always handy to grab, and it doubles as a night light. It just plugs in; no wiring involved. This is my second purchase; it was a birthday gift for a girlfriend. She is equally delighted by this dryer&#x27;s speed.</li>
            <li> Very nice hair blowers.  Easy to attach to bathroom wall.  Makes it very handy to use and there is no need for a place to store when you are done.</li>
            <li> Be careful that you are selecting what you want.  I didn&#x27;t read the description closely and thought it was the kind of dryer I was replacing that wired into the wall.  This one plugs in to an outlet and it has been a challenge to mount since the footprint of the base is smaller than the one I had previously.  My fault, not theirs, but the image looks exactly like what I had.  We eventully bought a picture frame, put scrapbook paper in it and bolted the dryer mounting to the frame and the frame to the wall to cover the previous dryer&#x27;s footprint.  A bit of a challenge, but the result looks OK.</li>
            <li> GREAT dryer for the price...nice features...the light may be just a bit too bright, but if you need a nightlight, its&#x27; great.</li>
            <li> This hair dryer was easy to mount to the wall, it&#x27;s light in weight, and  it dries hair. Mounting requires the ability to drill two holes in the wall where the mounting plate goes. A template is provided. There must be an electrical outlet within reach of the mounting location.</li>
            <li> We own a new condo in St. Maarten and because we will be renting it, we felt that having a secure and space saving hair dryer would be most practical yet beneficial to our guests. The night light feature is really not something that would really be considered a night light so that&#x27;s why I did not give it 5 stars.  It serves it&#x27;s purpose and so we were pleased.    [...]</li>
            <li> I had recently been on vacation, and the hotel had this hair dryer in their bathrooms.  I liked it so much I decided I wanted one for my bathroom, found it, and purchased it!  I have no regrets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all I love the convenience of having it mounted within easy reach.  I am always running late, so being able to \\&quot;grab and dry\\&quot; is wonderful.  It is a powerful little dryer and dries my hair quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know others complain about the nightlight... in the beginning it seemed bright so I would simply pull the bathroom door to.  Now I don&#x27;t even notice it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for something efficient, practical and convenient, this is the little dryer for you!</li>
            <li> I have wanted a hang up hair dryer for years and thought they were too expensive for me.  I found this one and have been delighted with it.</li>
            <li> This dryer is small, compact and has plenty of power. Gets the hair dried more quickly than others.  It is a great product and does a great job.   I would highly recemmond it.</li>
            <li> Is there a night light and a hook for hanging the cord up so it doesn&#x27;t lie on the counter?  None of the reviews mentioned these two features so before I buy 2 of these dryers I need to find out.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> The dryer arrived promptly.  The dryer is very powerful however on the high setting the air is not as warm as I would like.  If you need a ton of air then this is the one.  If you want something greater than lukewarm air then look at another model.  The switch is up almost against the blower body and very small in footprint so big fingers may find it challenging.  The handle design is simple and grasping it is easy.  Again its biggest plus is a massive volume of air.  Overall its a keeper.</li>
            <li> I love the size and convenience of this dryer for a small bath with little storage. It&#x27;s powerful for its size and the heat isn&#x27;t blast-furnace hot like my old hair dryer.</li>
            <li> Overall a good product.  Has a powerful motor in a very compact form.  No problems installing holder and have had no problems with unit.  There are only 2 settings, 1 low and no heat, and 1 high with heat.  However, my wife says the heat setting is not that warm so factor that in.  If you want real heat, this may not be unit for you.</li>
            <li> Yes. I like it. I just wish it was even hotter but it IS hot enough. I like the nightlight too. Mounting can be easy depending....</li>
            <li> I blow dry my hair every morning after my shower, works great,   light weight in my hand...</li>
            <li> This is my second Andis Hangup dryer. It is better than the first because the cord to the wall plug is better designed to run through the hanger.   It keeps the cord neater.</li>
            <li> Perfect for RV - compact, mounts easily, light a benefit, great price for great product</li>
            <li> The product was efficient when it worked, however after one year it ceased to function. When you purchase a product, you expect it work for a much longer period of time.</li>
            <li> This is a great little hair dryer.  I have one in each bathroom.  It is compact, powerfull and out of the way.</li>
            <li> The purchase was expediant and the product was received promptly.  Thanks for a great experience.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this dryer. It frees up space on my counter since it is a hang-up, and yet has great blowing power. And the night light is a great plus! No need to have a separate night light to take up valuable outlet space (there is never enough outlets in a bathroom).</li>
            <li> I have these fans in both my bathrooms. Finally, after 12-13 years we decided to replace both of them. The new fans look and works the same way. Hope to have the second set as long as the previous one.</li>
            <li> We purchased this item January 3, 2011 for my daughter&#x27;s bathroom. We installed it the following week. She uses a hairdryer infrequently, about once or twice a week.  She informed us tonight that the nightlight stopped working last week and when she uses the hairdryer it smells like plastic melting. Sure enough, I just checked it out. No nightlight -- plastic burning smell when turned on. Our return period window for Amazon is now expired. I just wrote Andis an email explaining what happened and will be waiting for a response. I will update what (if anything) customer service does about this situation. Until then, I am giving this item one star.</li>
            <li> I have owned one of these for over 5 years and couldn&#x27;t be more satisfied.  I originally paid $40.00 and thought that was a high price, but after years of faultless performance, I&#x27;d pay that price again.  I&#x27;m glad I don&#x27;t have to because now the price has really come down.  This small hairdryer has more air force than all the big clunky ones I&#x27;ve used in the past.  The \\&quot;telephone\\&quot; type cord is rugged and will stretch as far as 10 feet.    Excellant product in every category.</li>
            <li> Works okay. Just wish I got the one that had a separate switch for the heat and speed. This one only has high heat on the high speed, which is very loud. Other than that, it&#x27;s a good hair dryer. Kids like that it is lightweight. Nightlight is a joke though.     As of December, although been doing this for about 2 months now, the hair dryer puts off a spark when the switch is flipped and it starts off real slow and slowly builds up speed. Sometimes it never gets back up to full speed. Big piece of junk!!!!!!    My previous wall-mounted hair dryer was a Sunbeam that I bought at Phar Mor about 15 years ago, before it finally died.</li>
            <li> This is the best gift my sis says she loves it thanks for this product it is a winner. Thanks again!</li>
            <li> Great product, easy to mount.  Powerful blower.  Excellent price.</li>
            <li> I used one of these for 6 years &amp; it worked well. So when the first one died, I bought another. But after 6 months of normal use it died and I now need a third one. Will try a different brand this time!</li>
            <li> Pros:  - Fits well in hand and is easily maneuverable  - Puts out high volumes of air at a high-enough temperature  - Very compact; fits in a very small space  - Night light is surprisingly useful; it lights the way to the bathroom without being so bright as to be distracting    Cons:  - Power cord length is not adjustable  - Included mounting screws/anchors are flimsy    I bought this Andis dryer to replace a similar type Conair unit that died after about a year&#x27;s use.  My wife&#x27;s habit of leaving her non-hanging dryer and tangle of cords all over the sink and vanity motivated me to get a replacement fast!    The dryer does its job -- drying -- very well.  The compact handset is easy to maneuver and it puts out a surprisingly high volume of air at the right temperature, which is a must for those with long or extra-thick hair.    This is the smallest unit of its kind I&#x27;ve seen.  The mounting bracket is barely wider than the dryer, which makes putting it into tight places a snap.    The relatively minor disadvantages have to do with the installation.  First, the power cord length cannot be adjusted.  It is one continuous cord from the bottom of handset, through the mounting bracket, and down to the GFCI power plug.  Some competing dryers have an electrical junction in the bracket which allows you to shorten the wire running from the bracket to the wall outlet and makes for a neater, tangle-free installation.  Second, and this is a quibble, the enclosed mounting screws and wall anchors are pretty flimsy.  I substituted a better pair I had sitting around in my toolbox.    All in all, this product does what it is supposed to very well and, despite a couple of one-time installation issues, I am very pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> It works great, has the night light for night in the guest bathroom.  My guests love not having to bring their own on trips to our home.</li>
            <li> My husband and I have used Andis hair dryer for years.  When ours stopped working, I was worried that I couldn&#x27;t find them again, so I went on line with Amazan and was pleased to find the same brand.  we love these dryer and glad to find them again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks&lt;br /&gt;Ruth O&#x27;Dell</li>
            <li> This is a great hairdryer. Don&#x27;t let the size fool you. Is much better than larger dryers. Also is great to hang in bathroom. I went back and bought more for each bathroom. Shipped fast.</li>
            <li> I have always loved the andis hairdryer but paid thirty some dollars for this and it only lasted couple months the switch quit working and the dryer would get so hot would shut off before could get my hair dry</li>
            <li> I have owned an Andis hair fryer for 10+ years and it has yet to overheat or burn out. I am updating only because of the night light. I don&#x27;t think the unit is any noisier than a regular hair dryer. The only downside is there are no heat settings (at least in the old model I own). Buy this; you&#x27;ll own it for a LONG time.</li>
            <li> Night light quit working after a week. The dryer itself works fine snd is handy being located on a wall and not in a drawer.</li>
            <li> I have one of these hair dryers in each bathroom.  They are easy to install, work well, and the night light is nice and bright (but not obnoxious).  My wife likes the power of this small dryer, but if you ask me they seem a bit on the loud side.  I think it is because of the very compact design - not enough plastic material to absorb the fan noise.</li>
            <li> Love this! Very strong drier. Night light is very bright.</li>
            <li> Perfect ARRIVED quickly but thought I ordered 2 only received1</li>
            <li> I love this unit. It is a space saver, always ready and handy when you need it and never in the way when you do not need it.</li>
            <li> Installed this in a guest bath with limited counter and storage space about 4 months ago.  It was easy to do, took minutes and is a low enough profile to not be in the way.  The nightlight is amazingly bright and suffices on it&#x27;s own.  The dryer is effective enough for guests, but lacks the extra features to make it a first choice dryer. It is a good buy at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I bought 5 of these (with nightlight) to put in each bathroom of my home.  I find the light is a useful addition and can be turned off by clicking the test button on the power cord.  The dryer is powerful, not extremely noisy, and appears to be of good quality contruction.</li>
            <li> I have had this dryer for several years and it finally gave out. Was thrilled to find the exact same one. We have it up in the bathroom and everyone loves it. Not that noisy. Has a night light in handle which is nice.</li>
            <li> Compact, easy to hang and reliable. Very powerful for the size. Would recommend this to anyone needing a small hair dryer.</li>
            <li> Dryer works great and it easy to use and the built in night light in really a nice addition.  I really like this item</li>
            <li> I have owned two of these and both didn&#x27;t last long.  Most recent one only 4 months.  Save your money.</li>
            <li> I have had a couple of these and would recommend it. I use it everyday and my last one lasted me 3-4 years.</li>
            <li> This is the best hair dryer I have ever owned.  It is a bit noisy due to the high volume of air it moves, but is very fast, compact, and lightweight. &lt;br /&gt;The wall mounting bracket is great and keeps the dryer conveniently stowed and still looks good.  I have owned two Andis hair dryers of similar construction and they have lasted about 5-6 years with daily use.  I highly recommend this unit if you do not mind the noise level.</li>
            <li> This wall-mounted hair dryer was the smallest one available, and that is why I selected it. It fits perfectly in a small space, and it is as inconspicuous as a wall-mounted dryer could be. It works very well, too --it is quite powerful for such a petite dryer. I really love it!</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed with this dryer.  It essentially was a hand-held dryer with a hanger.  The hanger was completely independent of the dryer.  I thought the hanger would have a plug, but no, the dryer had the plug and a very long cord.  I thought the hanger would turn the dryer off when the dryer was placed in the hanger--no, you just turned the dryer off as you would any hand held.  Save your money and buy a hook to hang your dryer on.</li>
            <li> We are enjoying this wall mounted hair dryer very much. It was a gift but we are both enjoying it.</li>
            <li> This is my second purchase of this Model Hair dryer..  The first one lasted about 15 years using two times a day!! So, I was happy to find that they still make this model,  very powerful and doesn&#x27;t clutter  up the bathroom with the wall mount and the way the cord is attached.  FIVE  STARS FOR SURE!!!!!!</li>
            <li> This product burned out after about 7 months of once a day, short usage. it is not reliable as this is the second (and last) one I have owned.</li>
            <li> We first used one in a hotel we stayed and my commented that exactly what we need for home. So I did a search and found them on Amazon and the rest is history.  We love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks,</li>
            <li> This is my second of the same model.  Previous one was used every day for over 5 years - exceptional value for money.</li>
            <li> Small size, lots of heat and easy mounting, cord length good no need to strech when mounted at optimum hight.</li>
            <li> I was dismayed when my Andis Hang-Up died because I had screwed it to the wall and I didn&#x27;t want to fill screw holes, so I was delighted to find it still available on Amazon. The new unit came with a novel night-light feature, which failed immediately, leaving an unpleasant smell of burnt plastic and an oily black soot deposit on the handle. The hair dryer still ran, but it filled my hair with the smell of an electrical fire. I sent it back to Amazon who promptly replaced it. The night light on the second unit again immediately failed, although without the odor of the other one. I&#x27;m still using it and I really like the hair dryer, but it appears to me that the night light is just not ready for prime time and may actually constitute a fire hazard.</li>
            <li> Blows hard and hot if needed. Had to disconnect night light, so bright, could be used as a street light. Also, loud enough to be used on a train, will wake everyone in the house with the door closed. Had a different brand for five years before, that was perfect, should have re-ordered the same.</li>
            <li> Sold my RV and needed a new one. This one was priced right and it works without all the night lights.</li>
            <li> looks good, but stopped working after 3 months, It&#x27;s beyond producr return time, so I cannot return and waste of money.</li>
            <li> I buy these for my vacation rental property. They work great for a nightlight, have lots of power and are rather compact. The wall hanger also works well. They have lasted more than three years and are still running like new. These are just back ups in case the others go out and I already have the wall mounted holder installed.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t get very hot, take longer to dry hair</li>
            <li> This was just what I was looking for, a hair dryer that hangs up and a night light, the hair dryer works fine, the night light lasted one day,</li>
            <li> Really like the hairdryer with the wall mount. The hair dryer is in a bathroom without a window, so the night light is perfect. The small size makes it a little noisier than a larger one, but all the other convienances make this worth it for me. Really like it</li>
            <li> Good compact hair dryer to mount in the bathroom for easy reach.  Blow dryer is compact yet powerful.  Night light is an added feature that is useful in the bathroom.</li>
            <li> I have used this dryer for many years and decided to purchase another one for travel.  Lightweight and a good airflow!</li>
            <li> This new hair dryer replaced an older larger model which I had for years and finally packed it in.  This smaller version was easy to mount and just as powerful although a bit noisier.</li>
            <li> On high, this thing really BLOWS! (Couldn&#x27;t resist.)  While it&#x27;s loud on high, it&#x27;s not bad on low, and I love that it doesn&#x27;t get so hot that it would frazzle your hair (or your dog&#x27;s fur or skin!).  The dryer&#x27;s base is small enough that it fits in the narrow area between the medicine cabinet and an outside corner of the wall, which is why I chose this particular blow dryer.  I really hated the night light, though, which seemed to bathe the bathroom in an eerie, green glow, so I put a piece of duct tape over it and that helped.  UPDATE:  It was okay while it lasted, but just short of two years after I bought it, it won&#x27;t work (the night light still works).  I could hear that the fan had started to struggle, so I was not surprised when it died.  However, I&#x27;ve used blow dryers for many more years than this, so I am disappointed that it quit working so early.</li>
            <li> This is a great hair dryer. The light is a nice feature. It is a bit bright though as I already purchased one of these a couple of yrs ago and the light was better.</li>
            <li> These are always great and arrive in a timely manor and they have the power needed by our guests at our Inn.,</li>
            <li> I am delighted with the hang-up feature. It&#x27;s easy storage!</li>
            <li> just like the one in the motel ! !!!  my wife uses  it each day for the last several years still works well</li>
            <li> We replaced a similar unit with this. Works good</li>
            <li> I have been purchasing Andis hair dryers for many years. I have been disappointed in the last few years because I&#x27;ve had two of them burn up.  I purchased two new ones with night lights and just a few days after using the first one the night light didn&#x27;t work.  I really like this product because it keeps the dryer in place and organized.  I have been purchasing this product for more than 10 years.</li>
            <li> The ANDIS 30925 Hangup hair dryer is a great little product.  Mounts to the wall in it&#x27;s own holder, so it is up out of the way.  It is small but very powerful and dries even the longest hair evenly and quickly with a nice strong flow of air without scorching.  The nightlight is a nice touch too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I would like to see the nightlight go back to a softer Green color.  The new blue nightlight is very bright and I had to put a piece of tape over it to mute it down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product, buy it for your house.</li>
            <li> We have used this hairdryer for years now and its the best we have found for a wall mount.</li>
            <li> Kind of weak. I&#x27;m not sure why they dont make a 1800w model. The night light is kind of cheesy too. Overall good product though. I&#x27;m very happy with it.</li>
            <li> Fabulous - had one before that lasted 9 years.  Hope this one lasts as long.  So easy just to grap off the wall instead of searching through drawers for regular hair dryers. Hotel style - very convenient.</li>
            <li> Received on time and as descried.</li>
            <li> I was very happy with the power and the night light feature is nice also but it only lasted one year. I&#x27;ve had dryers that lasted many years and I would not purchase this brand again. I have very fine hair so it was never used for long periods of time and didn&#x27;t have to work hard to dry my hair.I expect a hair dryer to last more than a year and this one didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> One of these is in the employee bathroom at work and I&#x27;d used it and decided I wanted one at home.  I love that it&#x27;s mounted on the wall and out of the way.  Works well for what I need.</li>
            <li> Googled hair dryer, found it at Amazon.com one of my trusted sites. Ordered it and got it 4 days ago. It is better than the old one as this model has an led night light built in. Great Product. Working fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks&lt;br /&gt;Amazon</li>
            <li> I have ordered Andis hangup dryers for every bath in every place I have lived for years. One finally burned out, and since I could not find the exact one I had previously, I ordered this one. Unlike my others, this dryer does not attach to a metal plate that is screwed into the wall, which allows for you to remove the whole thing, if necessary. This one attaches directly to the wall with two screws that go through the plastic casing. It does not seem nearly as secure. The plastic piece that attaches to the wall is cheaper quality that the older dryers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My biggest complaint, however, is that this dryer does not blow HOT air, only warm. There are high and low settings, but that is for the blast of air, not the heat. It may be better for the hair not to have such hot air, but I do not like drying my hair with only warm air. I&#x27;ve thrown away the box and won&#x27;t go to the trouble to return it, but I will replace it as soon as I find another.</li>
