            <li>I have natural hair and its perfect for an up</li>
            <li>I love my twist</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>That would be okay for dreads.  </li>
            <li>You&#x27;re better off going to the beauty store  </li>
            <li>i love everything about the hair, i would recommend this hair to every one.</li>
            <li>I really love the hair, it came with in 2-3 days of purchase.</li>
            <li>I so love the hair....</li>
            <li>so there aren&#x27;t many styles I can wear to change how my hair looks.</li>
            <li>Good price, arrive at a reasonable time, will be ordering more</li>
            <li>I use this hair for my buns on natural hair and it has worked out great.</li>
            <li>The picture is an accurate rendition of what it will look like.  </li>
            <li>This hair is soft and looks great as twists but the package doesn&#x27;t give you very much.</li>
            <li>I received many compliments and no one could tell that it wasn&#x27;t my real hair.</li>
            <li>good quality, standard hair.</li>
            <li>I love the hair so much ....</li>
            <li>I actually used this hair to do Faux locs and it came out amazing.</li>
            <li>I love the hair, I have bought it 3 times, fast delivery and very gold customer care.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found that using this type of hair blends really nicely when I make a faux bun and flat twist braids.</li>
            <li>Soft and easy to use.</li>
            <li>However the packs font contain a lot of hair so order up a pack to make sure its enough.</li>
            <li>this is exactly what I ordered.</li>
            <li>its the exact color that I order..</li>
            <li>I twist my hair frequently,  so I am aware of the number of bundles needed for my head.</li>
            <li>feels ok to the touch, but quickly dries out and feels like straw in a matter of a few days.  </li>
            <li>I received my order.. FAST.</li>
            <li>I like the length, the texture, not so much.  </li>
            <li>asked me if it was my really hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used other brands of hair and the packs were always super full.</li>
            <li>do bun, I would highly recommend and it blended very well with the wave pattern of my hair</li>
            <li>I brought this to try out some &#x27;high bun&#x27; hair  styles I saw on You Tube.</li>
            <li>it blends very well with my natural hair, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to be a lot of hair in the bag BOY, does it tangle.  </li>
            <li>It certainly is better than a brand I bought before that felt coarse and dry.</li>
            <li>But I wanted soft,</li>
            <li>if there&#x27;s one near you where it&#x27;s cheaper anyway.</li>
            <li>Blends well with my natural hair for a faux bun</li>
            <li>exactly what i expected and needed</li>
            <li>The twists turned out okay, but looked dried and almost like dreads after a few days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hair</li>
            <li>The hair was exactly what I expected and came faster than the expected delivery date.</li>
            <li>exactly what was expected and got to me even earlier than I expected.</li>

            <li> I brought this to try out some &#x27;high bun&#x27; hair  styles I saw on You Tube. It matched my natural hair perfectly. I received many compliments and no one could tell that it wasn&#x27;t my real hair.</li>
            <li> exactly what was expected and got to me even earlier than I expected.</li>
            <li> Purchased last year for 4.50 a pack, went to buy again only to find out its now 11??? Absolutely not worth it</li>
            <li> The quality, length and color are all perfect. Very easy to work with and looks great. Very easy to maintain.</li>
            <li> The hair was exactly what I expected and came faster than the expected delivery date. However the packs font contain a lot of hair so order up a pack to make sure its enough.</li>
            <li> The price is a rip off.</li>
            <li> I love the hair, I have bought it 3 times, fast delivery and very gold customer care. I had an issue with shipping and they handled it immediately!  Totally suggest this product and user.</li>
            <li> loved it! very satisfied and i plan to buy again. good quality, standard hair. exactly what i expected and needed</li>
            <li> This hair was way to rough and course. My hair is a kinky curly texture and it kept unraveling out of the Marley hair.  That issue is not fault of the Marley hair. The issue was that the hair was way to rough and course.</li>
            <li> great marley hair. I love my twist</li>
            <li> Bought the hair it&#x27;s okay. The picture is an accurate rendition of what it will look like.  It WILL NOT look like Havana Hair twists after you do them. That is what I used them for.  The twists turned out okay, but looked dried and almost like dreads after a few days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hair feels ok to the touch, but quickly dries out and feels like straw in a matter of a few days.  That would be okay for dreads.  But I wanted soft, Havanah Like twists.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Packaging says &amp;#34;feels like human hair.&amp;#34;  It does not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;YES - for Dreads and box braids&lt;br /&gt;NO - Havana Twists</li>
            <li> This hair is soft and looks great as twists but the package doesn&#x27;t give you very much. I bought nine and ended up needing 13 to finish my hair.  You&#x27;re better off going to the beauty store  if there&#x27;s one near you where it&#x27;s cheaper anyway.</li>
            <li> Good braiding hair. Soft and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Good price, arrive at a reasonable time, will be ordering more</li>
            <li> this is exactly what I ordered. I love the hair so much .... its the exact color that I order.. the hair is long just like the picture. I received my order.. FAST.</li>
            <li> The Afro Marley hair is awesome i love everything about the hair, i would recommend this hair to every one.</li>
            <li> Second time ordering . Really impressed . Blends well with my natural hair for a faux bun</li>
            <li> I like that it blends very well with my natural hair, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to be a lot of hair in the bag BOY, does it tangle.  Other than the tangles and the small amount you receive in the pack, I have no other complaints.</li>
            <li> I actually used this hair to do Faux locs and it came out amazing. Check out my YT video to see what they look like ---&amp;#62; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;HNfSeiBdvLk&amp;list&#x3D;UUWatGJzwR0HvQJPh-DOpDPQ</li>
            <li> I have natural hair and its perfect for an up do bun, I would highly recommend and it blended very well with the wave pattern of my hair</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve not use it yet. I like the length, the texture, not so much.  It certainly is better than a brand I bought before that felt coarse and dry.</li>
            <li> Used this for a crochet roller set and dipped in steaming water luke on YouTube turned out great.</li>
            <li> Ew.  No, don&#x27;t get it</li>
            <li> The bundles of hair that I received were very thin. I twist my hair frequently,  so I am aware of the number of bundles needed for my head. I was very disappointed.  I would not recommend.</li>
            <li> The bags were a little small but I order 10 pack ...I used all 10  for jumbo Marley twist</li>
            <li> I really love the hair, it came with in 2-3 days of purchase. I installed Marley Braids and a lot of people (who didn&#x27;t know me) asked me if it was my really hair. If your looking for something that gives off the impression of dreads than this product is great.</li>
            <li> I so love the hair....</li>
            <li> Awesome. I use this hair for my buns on natural hair and it has worked out great. Good quality product. Tangles some but that is to be expected. Tangles loosen with finger combing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other brands of hair and the packs were always super full. When I got this one, I was greatly disappointed. I felt like half the pack of hair was missing, or never made it.&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, the hair is great. I have a TWA so there aren&#x27;t many styles I can wear to change how my hair looks. I&#x27;ve found that using this type of hair blends really nicely when I make a faux bun and flat twist braids. The 1B I ordered matches my hair perfectly...I am 3 stars happy about my purchase.</li>
