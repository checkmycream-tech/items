            <li> This really works,  I&#x27;ve gone from caramel to a few shades shy of fair after a few uses (5-7). It&#x27;s instant. But when I stop using it seems like I get dark all over again which sucks</li>
            <li> This product works very well!! I will be ordering it agian!!!!</li>
            <li> The product doesn&#x27;t live up to the hype.</li>
            <li> I found this product very helpful and with good results for the first time application however, although the product acknowledges subsequent usage  after the recommend time from when the first application was used. It did not recommend storage options to extend the potency of the product therefore, I suspect that might account for the 2nd usage was not as effective as the first resulting in a less effective results which was what I achieved the second and third time usage. Overall the initial results were the more favorable in addition, to lengthy, date of delivery. If I would reorder this product again I might consider selecting a speedy mailing option and order 2 .</li>
            <li> Excellent, can save others thousands on bleach or fade products!</li>
            <li> Is not like what they saying on comertiol . I don&#x27;t see any deferent on my face , I am you right is not woursed to buy it</li>
            <li> Wonderful works well, can&#x27;t wait to get more!!!</li>
            <li> Made my skin darker and bleached my hair.</li>
            <li> Worst product ever bought. Wast of time and money. Never should be sold</li>
            <li> NOT TOO GOOD.YOUR SKIN IS TOO ITCHY.</li>
            <li> It came early it was a great price but didn&#x27;t  see any results yet</li>
            <li> Love this product.....just wish it wouldnt take forever to arrive!!!!</li>
            <li> I wish measurements were not in metric.</li>
            <li> This is just a hair bleaching cream it does not work on dark spots.</li>
            <li> all it did is bleach the hairs in the Area.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t even deserve a star, it did nothing it said it would do except lightened my facial hair. I&#x27;ll definitely not buy again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a black mixed with Hispanic male. Who has always had a light Carmel skin with a red under tone. For the past two years working out in the sun my face had gotten so dark my body looked like it belong to another person. So when I was told about this product I was happy to see my old self again. But after using it for the first time today. I can say that this product just bleached the hair in the areas where I place the product. No results of lighting and spots. But again its only been one application. Every one has different skin. Some products work well with others. But for now I&#x27;m going to give this product one star. But will use it again to see if anything changes I will keep you updated</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work it only bleached the hair on my face and now I have blonde facial hair and it looks crazy</li>
            <li> It does not lighten. Only lightens the hair</li>
            <li> It took a long time to get here, and when I opened it up, the instructions are so small that I can&#x27;t read it. So I am going to have to go online to see if I can get the instructions on how to use it or see if I can scan it at home and make the instructions bigger.</li>
            <li> I am a 43 year old AA female. After using this product one time, I immediately noticed a difference. My skin was a shade brighter, I notice a 50% pore reduction and my skin texture looks 10 years younger.</li>
