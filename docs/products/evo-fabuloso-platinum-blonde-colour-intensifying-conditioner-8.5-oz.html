            <li>Great for blondes!</li>
            <li>THE BEST PRODUCT EVER!!!!</li>
            <li>Great product for my bleach blond highlights!</li>
            <li>The fact that I&#x27;ve used 2 bottles proves that it&#x27;s really great!</li>
            <li>Its soooo much better!</li>
            <li>I love this!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d buy again for sure!</li>
            <li>It smells nice too</li>
            <li>I really blot the water out of my hair before applying it, it seems to work best</li>
            <li>it rinses off very easily from your hands.  </li>
            <li>Very happy with product will purchase more in future when needed.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>but I think these work better.</li>
            <li>Will re order forever :)</li>
            <li>I immediately fell in love with it and wanted to buy it.  </li>
            <li>It works like magic on platinum hair (hence the name, I know)</li>
            <li>I love that it doesn&#x27;t have propylene glycol in it, because I&#x27;m allergic to that.  </li>
            <li>This is better than the one product of purple conditioner could find at the salon without propylene glycol.  </li>
            <li>It requires way more product then it says its supposed too.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t imagine how quick this would be gone for someone who has thicker longer hair!</li>
            <li>It makes my hair light and reduces the time I have to get it touched up.</li>
            <li>I have silver hair and it was always turning yellowish but this conditioner keeps me shinny and free of any color.</li>
            <li>After I do my roots, I usually have to wait a couple weeks while using purple shampoo to balance it out but one condition with this made it perfect!</li>
            <li>Delivered very fast!</li>
            <li>but the boliage just does a better job at natural highlights!</li>
            <li>right</li>
            <li>My stylist recommended this to me and used it on my hair the first time I ever went to her.  </li>
            <li>The product has a nice smell and It´s extremely purple, just what I need for platinum shades.</li>
            <li>At first I really didn&#x27;t care for the smell, but then it grew on me.</li>
            <li>My hair is dyed med blonde with very light cool blonde highlights.  </li>
            <li>This really takes the brassiness out and helps tone.</li>
            <li>I really like this product for myself and have given as gifts to others.  </li>
            <li>I go very brassy.  </li>
            <li>I really like it</li>
            <li>It was still kind of yellow, so she used the Evo Fabuloso and it made the roots ashy grey.  </li>
            <li>If you bleach your hair and you don&#x27;t own this, you&#x27;re missing out!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think I can live without this conditioner!</li>
            <li>I HIGHLY RECOMMEND</li>
            <li>my hair REALLY  well and leaves it feeling soft.  </li>
            <li>Quite honestly, I haven&#x27;t been using for a few weeks and my hair doesn&#x27;t look much different then before.</li>
            <li>After reading all the rave reviews, I had high expectations for this product to remove the brassoness that had developed in my highlights.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend and I will keep using as I have not come across any other product that even comes close to fixing the brassiness I get right after coloring my hair.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Store bought toners don&#x27;t do much for me for some reason, my bleach still looks yellow.</li>
            <li>really easily being far from a natural blonde, and it keeps it cooled down when i mix it into my hair routine about twice a week.</li>
            <li>the entire reason i bought it was to make my hair look less yellow and more platinum blond.</li>
            <li>Well, she bleached it with some blue-ish bleach and used a toner to calm the hair down</li>
            <li>It makes my hair so soft and not dry.</li>
            <li>Both of which I highly suggest) when I made the plunge of going a white ash blonde.</li>
            <li>I used like 12 pumps because my hair is about 26 inches long and the whole thing is bleached blonde.  </li>
            <li>but my stylist didn&#x27;t want to lift my hair drastically from black roots to platinum on the first session.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty expensive for how much I have to use &amp; how fast I went through it.</li>

            <li> it&#x27;s natural white and was having a hard time finding a shampoo and conditioner that would remove the yellow tinge that I get due to our hard, mineral rich water.  </li>

            <li> This is a must have. I don&#x27;t think I can live without this conditioner! It makes my hair light and reduces the time I have to get it touched up. Before using this conditioner my hair would become yellow after a few weeks after highlights. With this conditioner they stay platinum blond and I only have to go touch up my roots when they grow out. Oh, and look into boliage instead of foils. Its soooo much better! Although you would still need to alternate between foils and boliage but the boliage just does a better job at natural highlights!</li>
            <li> The best toning conditioner of my life!!!</li>
            <li> Love it. I have curly frizzy hair and it leaves my hair feeling nourished compared to other toning treatments.  I get brassy really easily being far from a natural blonde, and it keeps it cooled down when i mix it into my hair routine about twice a week.</li>
            <li> this conditioner makes my hair darker, but still leaves yellowish hew in it. the entire reason i bought it was to make my hair look less yellow and more platinum blond. room for improvement.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get any other purple conditioner. This is the ONE and ONLY!</li>
            <li> Great for blondes! This really takes the brassiness out and helps tone. At first I really didn&#x27;t care for the smell, but then it grew on me. It makes my hair so soft and not dry.</li>
            <li> If you bleach your hair and you don&#x27;t own this, you&#x27;re missing out! My stylist used it on me when I got my last haircut and I had to come home and order it right away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Store bought toners don&#x27;t do much for me for some reason, my bleach still looks yellow. After I do my roots, I usually have to wait a couple weeks while using purple shampoo to balance it out but one condition with this made it perfect! I will buy this forever!</li>
            <li> Delivered very fast! The product has a nice smell and It´s extremely purple, just what I need for platinum shades. I recommend it</li>
            <li> I recently let my hair grow out to it&#x27;s natural white and was having a hard time finding a shampoo and conditioner that would remove the yellow tinge that I get due to our hard, mineral rich water.  This combined with Shiny Silver shampoo do the trick.  I tried the Sally&#x27;s purple products but I think these work better.</li>
            <li> Faster shipping then stated on the shipping info. Will re order forever :)</li>
            <li> This product CHANGED MY LIFE!!  My stylist recommended this to me and used it on my hair the first time I ever went to her.  I have asian thick black hair and wanted to be bleached blonde.  I wanted to be platinum blonde but my stylist didn&#x27;t want to lift my hair drastically from black roots to platinum on the first session.  I just did the roots by the way.  Well, she bleached it with some blue-ish bleach and used a toner to calm the hair down so it didn&#x27;t look brassy (saxophone gold color).  It was still kind of yellow, so she used the Evo Fabuloso and it made the roots ashy grey.  NO YELLOW AT ALL!  I immediately fell in love with it and wanted to buy it.  The salon was selling it for $38, so I looked online and found the cheapest on Amazon for $18 and bought it ASAP.  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS if you just bleached your hair and the brassyness is still there.  It&#x27;s not permanent, but will last through about 2 weeks.  It did for me anyway.  It says to use 4-8 pumps I think, but I used like 12 pumps because my hair is about 26 inches long and the whole thing is bleached blonde.  It works so well I don&#x27;t need to go in the salon to touch up my hair for toner sessions.  Just for roots only now since it&#x27;s not going to make my roots blonde.  But yeah...I will use this product for ever until I go back to black hair again.  This works so well I don&#x27;t trust any other brand!  It smells nice too and I feel so pampered when using this.  THE BEST PRODUCT EVER!!!!</li>
            <li> I really like this product for myself and have given as gifts to others.  It works like magic on platinum hair (hence the name, I know) but it also works on just brassy blonde hair like mine.  Highly recommend and I will keep using as I have not come across any other product that even comes close to fixing the brassiness I get right after coloring my hair.</li>
            <li> I love this!  My hair is dyed med blonde with very light cool blonde highlights.  I go very brassy.  This tones my hair REALLY  well and leaves it feeling soft.  I really blot the water out of my hair before applying it, it seems to work best if my hair is towel dried (I still do the whole thing in the shower).  I love that it doesn&#x27;t have propylene glycol in it, because I&#x27;m allergic to that.  This doesn&#x27;t bother my scalp at all.  This is better than the one product of purple conditioner could find at the salon without propylene glycol.  I really like it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the entire bottle of this and my overall feelings for it are mixed. Pros: It DOES help with brassiness. I incorporated it into my usual routine (Lush Daddy-O purple shampoo &amp; Organix Coconut Milk conditioner. Both of which I highly suggest) when I made the plunge of going a white ash blonde. I noticed I can go a few weeks longer on a toning appointment while using this so I guess technically it does what its supposed too. CONS: It requires way more product then it says its supposed too. The directions say two or three pumps... I have to use about 12 and I have shoulder length thin damaged hair! I can&#x27;t imagine how quick this would be gone for someone who has thicker longer hair! It&#x27;s pretty expensive for how much I have to use &amp; how fast I went through it. I only used it about 2 or 3 times a week. I also feel like it dries out your hair (worse then it already will be if you&#x27;re hair is light enough to require this product). Quite honestly, I haven&#x27;t been using for a few weeks and my hair doesn&#x27;t look much different then before. I don&#x27;t regret buying it but I&#x27;m definitely not re-purchasing it.</li>
            <li> Whitens and brightens my grey/silver hair</li>
            <li> I have silver hair and it was always turning yellowish but this conditioner keeps me shinny and free of any color.</li>
            <li> After reading all the rave reviews, I had high expectations for this product to remove the brassoness that had developed in my highlights. I carefully followed the inztructions and could see no noticeable results. As far as I&#x27;m concerned it was a waste of $20. It also failed as a conditioner. My hair was not soft and silky as advertised.</li>
            <li> Great product for my bleach blond highlights! You don&#x27;t have use gloves, as it suggests...it rinses off very easily from your hands.  It does however, stain towels! I&#x27;d buy again for sure!</li>
            <li> The fact that I&#x27;ve used 2 bottles proves that it&#x27;s really great! Although I think it&#x27;s kinda of pricy. It makes my deeply damaged hair &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; looking and I think it removes the yellow color well. Definitely recommend it!</li>
