            <li>One of the best things I ever bought.</li>
            <li>The best part is that it doesn&#x27;t hurt to get the tangles out.</li>
            <li>so this product isn&#x27;t best for that because the water gets inside of the brush.  </li>
            <li>I won best grandma of the month.  </li>

            <li>Not as good as I was hoping for</li>

            <li>The longer your hair, the more you&#x27;ll notice how great this brush works.</li>
            <li>It so nice on my hair</li>
            <li>It works much better if you use a good conditioner or detangling spray along with it.</li>
            <li>And she might even brush her own hair, now.</li>
            <li>All Soft got the best results with the brush.</li>
            <li>It was also virtually pain free which I loved.</li>
            <li>The brush is okay, but wasn&#x27;t as effective as I had hoped.  </li>
            <li>She has very fine hair</li>
            <li>and I can easily brush through it!</li>
            <li>Love love love this brush!</li>

            <li>Really well made and works great on my hair.</li>
            <li>but how many words can you write about a hairbrush?</li>
            <li>Thank you for this most efficient brush.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s an ok brush,</li>
            <li>I was able to brush her hair without tears or a fight.</li>
            <li>They love it.</li>
            <li>I love this brush.</li>
            <li>We love this brush</li>
            <li>This was a gift for my grand daughter and she loves it.</li>
            <li>and I gladly paid for it.</li>
            <li>I have and will try ANYTHING to make the process a more enjoyable experience for the both of us.</li>
            <li>Now I don&#x27;t hear that frightful sound!</li>
            <li>So gentle and amazing at detangling!</li>
            <li>This brush works pretty good.</li>
            <li>it has pretty good reviews).  </li>
            <li>at giving the look of more body and fullness without pulling or breaking her hair like many other brushes she&#x27;s tried, She is very happy with it.</li>
            <li>So my cats got a great new brush...</li>
            <li>I really love the entangling brush for fine hair.  </li>
            <li>For long fine hair they are the best I have ever had</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy so far</li>
            <li>Works great in natural hair also.</li>
            <li>Great hair brush, I am 55 years young and always have had problems after washing my hair</li>
            <li>There is nothing special about this except it will pull your hair out and hurts!</li>
            <li>Plus the brushes were full of hair!</li>
            <li>I looked at reviews for this and other supposed detangling brushes and decided this one probably had the best chance of working.  </li>
            <li>The tips of the bristles are a bit sharp, however, it does a wonderful job of removing the tangles.  </li>
            <li>and my hair is easy to comb with them.</li>
            <li>So easy, my eight year old is doing her own curly hair!</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to anyone with fine hair.</li>
            <li>they both have fine hair and get up every morning with tangles</li>
            <li>This grabs my daughter&#x27;s fine hair and won&#x27;t let go.  </li>
            <li>for my Schnauzer dog...seems to work on his fine hair</li>
            <li>Just the thing for fine hair.</li>
            <li>I bought the brushes, one for fine hair and one for medium hair, after my kids begged me for them for about a year.  </li>
            <li>I have 2 daughters with fine hair that is often tangled.</li>
            <li>She has tangled fine hair that cannot be combed even with fingers.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This is one amazing brush that gets her to comb her own hair and quietly!  </li>
            <li>Brush feels cheap, plastic.</li>
            <li>Seems cheaply made but my daughters prefer this brush</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not going to be completely smooth or painfree</li>
            <li>She says, this morning, &amp;#34;My hair is so smooth, and it didn&#x27;t even hurt!&amp;#34; She LOVES the brush.</li>
            <li>Her hair is smooth and neat.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t leave your hair silky smooth like brushing with a &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; brush or this would have been a 5 star.</li>
            <li>The brush quality itself feels extremely cheap yet the prince is nothing but cheap.  </li>
            <li>i bought it because the wife and my 5 years old daughter loved how its comfortable when they using it</li>
            <li>really be surprized !!!</li>
            <li>got it at a decent price, works fine on my baby but bristles feel very cheap bend easily just by playing with it</li>
            <li>I can brush my hair, which gets very tangled as It is very fine.  </li>
            <li>So, in order to do a really good job of brushing hair, you must brush the top of the hair and then brush underneath on the other side also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, no screaming and being able to just remind my daughter to brush her own hair, which she is able to do in less than 1 minute by herself....</li>
            <li>I have long hair and the ends tend to tangle quickly - this brush is great for quick untangling.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair that easily tangles and a tender head, so I really dig this brush.</li>
            <li>All people shed hair so it was no surprise that it was full of hair.</li>
            <li>First of all, there&#x27;s no noticeable difference between the fine and medium hair brush.  </li>
            <li>As always, the commercial made it look awesome, but that couldn&#x27;t be further from the truth.</li>
            <li>Had high hopes for &amp;#34;no more tears&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t work any better then a normal brush.</li>
            <li>It is made of cheap plastic that had to be put together when I first got it.</li>
            <li>I just wanted 1 normal one and 1 fine one, thus the buy one get one free.  </li>
            <li>He loves this brush (previous kinds were not so welcome).</li>
            <li>&amp; it&#x27;s my daughter&#x27;s favorite brush thus far!</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t really de-tangle my daughter&#x27;s fine hair as well as advertised.</li>
            <li>straight and baby fine.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t have to be fast or leave their hair looking salon fabulous, just didn&#x27;t have to hurt and cause \\&quot;brushing squirm.\\</li>
            <li>Worth every penny</li>
            <li>Still useful, but not as it was.  </li>
            <li>So I got this brush for a seven year old with more hair than anyone I know.</li>
            <li>Hurts my daughter even more than her old brush.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The brush worked by: easily brushing thru my daughters fine hair; smoothing out any potential knots and made a 40 minute process of brushing into 5 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>We bought two of these brushes: one for fine one for normal.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t even use it because it doesn&#x27;t really reach my scalp, so I guess I&#x27;ll clean it and offer it to someone</li>
            <li>Great for long fine hair, but stupendous for folks with arthritis in their shoulders who want to keep their hair long.</li>
            <li>I actually bought this to try on my Maltese that has fine hair and tangles easy, this brush works very well without pulling!</li>
            <li>This brush is exquisite; glides right through wet hair after shower, and dry hair first thing in the morning --then windblown or hat-hair.</li>
            <li>She has long fine hair that tangles easily.  </li>
            <li>it arrived on time just doesnt take out  tangles much easier than a regular brush, It doesnt pull on them just kind of skips over them</li>
            <li>It is rather light weight plastic, and buying it at BB&amp;B, we didn&#x27;t get a second free.  </li>
            <li>I have thick fine hair and was full of gorgeous knots when I tried this out and WOW!</li>
            <li>it really does work!</li>
            <li>The first being, I like to wash my brushes once a week</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t seem to untangle much better than my regular hair brush.</li>
            <li>/&gt;She cried more in the first two minutes of taking the brush out of the box and to her hair than she ever did with a regular brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I should have come here and read the reviews first.</li>
            <li>My daughter has tried so many different types of brushes.  </li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t do any better than my regular brush.</li>
            <li>Since we have gotten this brush she is constantly brushing her own hair, and does not have a problem with us brushing her hair because it does not pull and hurt like normal brushes do.</li>
            <li>We own this brush, the wet brush and the knot genie.</li>
            <li>Definitely helps detangle my very fine, tangly hair without getting stuck or causing too much pain.</li>
            <li>but I don’t believe the brush actually goes through as much hair, definitely more work.</li>
            <li>In recent years reducing use of chemicals, so fineness is truly silky and easily tangled.</li>
            <li>I manage to get my hair into astonishing tangles with some of my messy up-dos and super curly hairstyles.</li>
            <li>It got out 99% of the tangles (a few stubborn ones kept re-tangling after brushing) but overall it was a win.</li>
            <li>Works really well.  </li>
            <li>My daughter has long naturally curly hair that is super fine</li>
            <li>So much for the claim that \\&quot;no hair is in the brush\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>We did like the brush because it does not hurt her as much on that part</li>
            <li>It really decreases hair loss from tangles that tear your hair apart.</li>
            <li>my kid, not so much.</li>
            <li>broke very soon after purchase.</li>
            <li>My wife says this really works.  </li>
            <li>It really hurt her</li>
            <li>so when you use it actually makes a sort of thudding sound as you brush through your hair.  </li>
            <li>Heck, the wife likes it so much that we will be ordering her one as well.</li>
            <li>The Wet brush is much better.</li>
            <li>I never feel like I am really getting all the way through their hair when I&#x27;m brushing.</li>
            <li>ouch less....wonderful product, and I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>She actually brushes her own hair now after her shower, before school and even several times in-between.</li>
            <li>brush has saved me a good 30 mins a day of delicate hair brushing and heartbreaking tears.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s going in our rather large box of other products that were sure to be the answer to our problem.</li>
            <li>My daughter has very knotty hair due to static from her school uniform</li>
            <li>Works great detangling my long over bleached tangled mess of hair.</li>
            <li>but the results are better than the other stuff out there.  </li>
            <li>These brushes are great and we usually don&#x27;t need the detangler; some mornings - some detangler is still necessary.</li>
            <li>My hair is medium length and straight with a decent amount of tangles</li>
            <li>long, fine hair.</li>
            <li>I got this for my granddaughter, who has long fine hair.  </li>
            <li>She has long, fine hair.</li>
            <li>Its very gentle, but its loud</li>
            <li>Works just like s regular brush, nothing special.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m not sure if there was some kind of film on the bristles that eventually wore off or what.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s true that there are lots and lots of bristles of different lengths</li>
            <li>The hairbrush worked well for tangles, but the commercial said it would not be full of hair.</li>
            <li>(less s&amp;h I&#x27;m sure).  </li>
            <li>If I had another, I&#x27;d probably run a bead of viscous super glue around the perimeter before the inevitable drop.</li>
            <li>My hair is thinning as I get older.</li>
            <li>, I live in a dry area and my hair is normally fine</li>
            <li>Plastic feels super cheap, so I&#x27;m not sure how durable this product is - time will tell -</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>My overall thought on the brush is it would be great on fine shorter hair but not meant for tough knots or tangles on long hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like a normal brush that pulls and hurts.</li>
            <li>I also tend to put my hair up in a messy bun and am able to comb it in the morning and have no problems or pulling.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a miracle brush, but it helps enough to have made it worth the price.</li>
            <li>This is probably my least favorite of the three (the wet brush is my favorite).</li>
            <li>My teen daughter swears it goes right through her tangles.</li>
            <li>original review of the pink Micheal Mercier brush is below.</li>
            <li>Works great Not really for thick hair though</li>
            <li>It was far better than the crying she did before</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>It completely worked!</li>
            <li>I have fine hair that is a tangled mess-</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t brush my hair very differently, it worked well both starting near the bottom and working up AND brushing regularly from the top.</li>
            <li>Yes, it is true that the brush does not go all the way through to the other side.  </li>
            <li>I have long fine hair, it tangles when I blow dry it, this brush didn&#x27;t help detangle it.</li>
            <li>I also have naturally curly hair but thicker.</li>
            <li>This worked well for my 10 year old daughter. . .</li>
            <li>My 7 year old daughter loves this brush</li>
            <li>Got it for my 5 year old, 30 dollars at a salon.</li>
            <li>With an ordinary brush, she gives screaming matches but honestly the first few brushes through her hair with this brush, she says &amp;#34;not bad!!&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>I got this for my six year old daughter that has straight long hair and</li>
            <li>It is a tiny bit frizzy when she gets out, but a quick once over with a wide tooth comb and the frizziness is gone.  </li>
            <li>Works very well with my long hair</li>
            <li>My wife has thin, very fine hair and this brush works</li>
            <li>The hairbrush is made of cheap, hard pressed plastic</li>
            <li>My 4 yrs old daughter now tolerates having her hair brushed/detangled without screaming the entire time.</li>
            <li>just not what I expected really.</li>
            <li>My 10 year old daughter wanted this for a birthday present.</li>
            <li>Well that&#x27;s because it barely brushes the hair.</li>
            <li>My $1 paddle brush from the Dollar Tree works way better than this piece of thin plastic junk.</li>
            <li>It does comb through hair nicely but the bristles are very weak and many on the outside layer have already broken off.  </li>
            <li>Actually the $1.00 hairbrush works much better - less pulling and less hair pulled.</li>
            <li>My 6 year old daughter has really fine hair that tangles and knots very easy making for difficult and painful hair brushing, especially in the winter whenthe climate is very dry adding to static in the air and hair</li>
            <li>My four year old daughter actually saw this commercial and told me that we should get this.</li>
            <li>I wish I hadn’t spent so much money on it as I could have gotten a cheaper brush that does the same thing.</li>
            <li>I saw one of these at my local store (different color but same brand and brush type - for fine hair) hoping to finally have something that would help tame my tangles</li>
            <li>Combing it results in major meltdowns on a daily basis.</li>
            <li>Also, it has strict limitations about not using when wet or to dry your hair so a brush for only one purpose kind of sucks</li>
            <li>I was skeptical at first, but the very first time I used it was effortless.</li>
            <li>For myself I can get directly out of shower and brush my long hair without pulling all of my hair out.  </li>
            <li>I have struggled all my life with tangles in thin fine hair.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> One of the best things I ever bought.</li>
            <li> The best part is that it doesn&#x27;t hurt to get the tangles out.</li>
            <li> so this product isn&#x27;t best for that because the water gets inside of the brush.  </li>
            <li> I won best grandma of the month.  </li>

            <li> Not as good as I was hoping for</li>
            <li> She has gorgeous, spiral curly hair and this brush</li>
            <li> The longer your hair, the more you&#x27;ll notice how great this brush works.</li>
            <li> It so nice on my hair</li>
            <li> It works much better if you use a good conditioner or detangling spray along with it.</li>
            <li> And she might even brush her own hair, now.</li>
            <li> All Soft got the best results with the brush.</li>
            <li> It was also virtually pain free which I loved.</li>
            <li> The brush is okay, but wasn&#x27;t as effective as I had hoped.  </li>
            <li> She has very fine hair</li>
            <li> and I can easily brush through it!</li>
            <li> Love love love this brush!</li>
            <li> Loved my brush so much bought 3 more as gifts!</li>
            <li> It have dropped it many times and it hasn&#x27;t broke at all.  </li>
            <li> Really well made and works great on my hair.</li>
            <li> but how many words can you write about a hairbrush?</li>
            <li> Thank you for this most efficient brush.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s an ok brush,</li>
            <li> I was able to brush her hair without tears or a fight.</li>
            <li> They love it.</li>
            <li> I love this brush.</li>
            <li> We love this brush</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my grand daughter and she loves it.</li>
            <li> and I gladly paid for it.</li>
            <li> I have and will try ANYTHING to make the process a more enjoyable experience for the both of us.</li>
            <li> Now I don&#x27;t hear that frightful sound!</li>
            <li> So gentle and amazing at detangling!</li>
            <li> This brush works pretty good.</li>
            <li> it has pretty good reviews).  </li>
            <li> at giving the look of more body and fullness without pulling or breaking her hair like many other brushes she&#x27;s tried, She is very happy with it.</li>
            <li> So my cats got a great new brush...</li>
            <li> I really love the entangling brush for fine hair.  </li>
            <li> For long fine hair they are the best I have ever had</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy so far</li>
            <li> Works great in natural hair also.</li>
            <li> Great hair brush, I am 55 years young and always have had problems after washing my hair</li>
            <li> There is nothing special about this except it will pull your hair out and hurts!</li>
            <li> Plus the brushes were full of hair!</li>
            <li> I looked at reviews for this and other supposed detangling brushes and decided this one probably had the best chance of working.  </li>
            <li> The tips of the bristles are a bit sharp, however, it does a wonderful job of removing the tangles.  </li>
            <li> and my hair is easy to comb with them.</li>
            <li> So easy, my eight year old is doing her own curly hair!</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone with fine hair.</li>
            <li> they both have fine hair and get up every morning with tangles</li>
            <li> This grabs my daughter&#x27;s fine hair and won&#x27;t let go.  </li>
            <li> for my Schnauzer dog...seems to work on his fine hair</li>
            <li> Just the thing for fine hair.</li>
            <li> I bought the brushes, one for fine hair and one for medium hair, after my kids begged me for them for about a year.  </li>
            <li> I have 2 daughters with fine hair that is often tangled.</li>
            <li> She has tangled fine hair that cannot be combed even with fingers.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This is one amazing brush that gets her to comb her own hair and quietly!  </li>
            <li> Brush feels cheap, plastic.</li>
            <li> Seems cheaply made but my daughters prefer this brush</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not going to be completely smooth or painfree</li>
            <li> She says, this morning, &amp;#34;My hair is so smooth, and it didn&#x27;t even hurt!&amp;#34; She LOVES the brush.</li>
            <li> Her hair is smooth and neat.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave your hair silky smooth like brushing with a &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; brush or this would have been a 5 star.</li>
            <li> The brush quality itself feels extremely cheap yet the prince is nothing but cheap.  </li>
            <li> i bought it because the wife and my 5 years old daughter loved how its comfortable when they using it</li>
            <li> really be surprized !!!</li>
            <li> got it at a decent price, works fine on my baby but bristles feel very cheap bend easily just by playing with it</li>
            <li> I can brush my hair, which gets very tangled as It is very fine.  </li>
            <li> So, in order to do a really good job of brushing hair, you must brush the top of the hair and then brush underneath on the other side also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, no screaming and being able to just remind my daughter to brush her own hair, which she is able to do in less than 1 minute by herself....</li>
            <li> I have long hair and the ends tend to tangle quickly - this brush is great for quick untangling.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair that easily tangles and a tender head, so I really dig this brush.</li>
            <li> All people shed hair so it was no surprise that it was full of hair.</li>
            <li> First of all, there&#x27;s no noticeable difference between the fine and medium hair brush.  </li>
            <li> As always, the commercial made it look awesome, but that couldn&#x27;t be further from the truth.</li>
            <li> Had high hopes for &amp;#34;no more tears&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work any better then a normal brush.</li>
            <li> It is made of cheap plastic that had to be put together when I first got it.</li>
            <li> I just wanted 1 normal one and 1 fine one, thus the buy one get one free.  </li>
            <li> He loves this brush (previous kinds were not so welcome).</li>
            <li> &amp; it&#x27;s my daughter&#x27;s favorite brush thus far!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really de-tangle my daughter&#x27;s fine hair as well as advertised.</li>
            <li> straight and baby fine.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t have to be fast or leave their hair looking salon fabulous, just didn&#x27;t have to hurt and cause \\&quot;brushing squirm.\\</li>
            <li> Worth every penny</li>
            <li> Still useful, but not as it was.  </li>
            <li> So I got this brush for a seven year old with more hair than anyone I know.</li>
            <li> Hurts my daughter even more than her old brush.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The brush worked by: easily brushing thru my daughters fine hair; smoothing out any potential knots and made a 40 minute process of brushing into 5 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> We bought two of these brushes: one for fine one for normal.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t even use it because it doesn&#x27;t really reach my scalp, so I guess I&#x27;ll clean it and offer it to someone</li>
            <li> Great for long fine hair, but stupendous for folks with arthritis in their shoulders who want to keep their hair long.</li>
            <li> I actually bought this to try on my Maltese that has fine hair and tangles easy, this brush works very well without pulling!</li>
            <li> This brush is exquisite; glides right through wet hair after shower, and dry hair first thing in the morning --then windblown or hat-hair.</li>
            <li> She has long fine hair that tangles easily.  </li>
            <li> it arrived on time just doesnt take out  tangles much easier than a regular brush, It doesnt pull on them just kind of skips over them</li>
            <li> It is rather light weight plastic, and buying it at BB&amp;B, we didn&#x27;t get a second free.  </li>
            <li> I have thick fine hair and was full of gorgeous knots when I tried this out and WOW!</li>
            <li> it really does work!</li>
            <li> The first being, I like to wash my brushes once a week</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to untangle much better than my regular hair brush.</li>
            <li> /&gt;She cried more in the first two minutes of taking the brush out of the box and to her hair than she ever did with a regular brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I should have come here and read the reviews first.</li>
            <li> My daughter has tried so many different types of brushes.  </li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t do any better than my regular brush.</li>
            <li> Since we have gotten this brush she is constantly brushing her own hair, and does not have a problem with us brushing her hair because it does not pull and hurt like normal brushes do.</li>
            <li> We own this brush, the wet brush and the knot genie.</li>
            <li> Definitely helps detangle my very fine, tangly hair without getting stuck or causing too much pain.</li>
            <li> but I don’t believe the brush actually goes through as much hair, definitely more work.</li>
            <li> In recent years reducing use of chemicals, so fineness is truly silky and easily tangled.</li>
            <li> I manage to get my hair into astonishing tangles with some of my messy up-dos and super curly hairstyles.</li>
            <li> It got out 99% of the tangles (a few stubborn ones kept re-tangling after brushing) but overall it was a win.</li>
            <li> Works really well.  </li>
            <li> My daughter has long naturally curly hair that is super fine</li>
            <li> So much for the claim that \\&quot;no hair is in the brush\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> We did like the brush because it does not hurt her as much on that part</li>
            <li> It really decreases hair loss from tangles that tear your hair apart.</li>
            <li> my kid, not so much.</li>
            <li> broke very soon after purchase.</li>
            <li> My wife says this really works.  </li>
            <li> It really hurt her</li>
            <li> so when you use it actually makes a sort of thudding sound as you brush through your hair.  </li>
            <li> Heck, the wife likes it so much that we will be ordering her one as well.</li>
            <li> The Wet brush is much better.</li>
            <li> I never feel like I am really getting all the way through their hair when I&#x27;m brushing.</li>
            <li> ouch less....wonderful product, and I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> She actually brushes her own hair now after her shower, before school and even several times in-between.</li>
            <li> brush has saved me a good 30 mins a day of delicate hair brushing and heartbreaking tears.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s going in our rather large box of other products that were sure to be the answer to our problem.</li>
            <li> My daughter has very knotty hair due to static from her school uniform</li>
            <li> Works great detangling my long over bleached tangled mess of hair.</li>
            <li> but the results are better than the other stuff out there.  </li>
            <li> These brushes are great and we usually don&#x27;t need the detangler; some mornings - some detangler is still necessary.</li>
            <li> My hair is medium length and straight with a decent amount of tangles</li>
            <li> long, fine hair.</li>
            <li> I got this for my granddaughter, who has long fine hair.  </li>
            <li> She has long, fine hair.</li>
            <li> Its very gentle, but its loud</li>
            <li> Works just like s regular brush, nothing special.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure if there was some kind of film on the bristles that eventually wore off or what.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s true that there are lots and lots of bristles of different lengths</li>
            <li> The hairbrush worked well for tangles, but the commercial said it would not be full of hair.</li>
            <li> (less s&amp;h I&#x27;m sure).  </li>
            <li> If I had another, I&#x27;d probably run a bead of viscous super glue around the perimeter before the inevitable drop.</li>
            <li> My hair is thinning as I get older.</li>
            <li> , I live in a dry area and my hair is normally fine</li>
            <li> Plastic feels super cheap, so I&#x27;m not sure how durable this product is - time will tell -</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> My overall thought on the brush is it would be great on fine shorter hair but not meant for tough knots or tangles on long hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like a normal brush that pulls and hurts.</li>
            <li> I also tend to put my hair up in a messy bun and am able to comb it in the morning and have no problems or pulling.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a miracle brush, but it helps enough to have made it worth the price.</li>
            <li> This is probably my least favorite of the three (the wet brush is my favorite).</li>
            <li> My teen daughter swears it goes right through her tangles.</li>
            <li> original review of the pink Micheal Mercier brush is below.</li>
            <li> Works great Not really for thick hair though</li>
            <li> It was far better than the crying she did before</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> It completely worked!</li>
            <li> I have fine hair that is a tangled mess-</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t brush my hair very differently, it worked well both starting near the bottom and working up AND brushing regularly from the top.</li>
            <li> Yes, it is true that the brush does not go all the way through to the other side.  </li>
            <li> I have long fine hair, it tangles when I blow dry it, this brush didn&#x27;t help detangle it.</li>
            <li> I also have naturally curly hair but thicker.</li>
            <li> This worked well for my 10 year old daughter. . .</li>
            <li> My 7 year old daughter loves this brush</li>
            <li> Got it for my 5 year old, 30 dollars at a salon.</li>
            <li> With an ordinary brush, she gives screaming matches but honestly the first few brushes through her hair with this brush, she says &amp;#34;not bad!!&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I got this for my six year old daughter that has straight long hair and</li>
            <li> It is a tiny bit frizzy when she gets out, but a quick once over with a wide tooth comb and the frizziness is gone.  </li>
            <li> Works very well with my long hair</li>
            <li> My wife has thin, very fine hair and this brush works</li>
            <li> The hairbrush is made of cheap, hard pressed plastic</li>
            <li> My 4 yrs old daughter now tolerates having her hair brushed/detangled without screaming the entire time.</li>
            <li> just not what I expected really.</li>
            <li> My 10 year old daughter wanted this for a birthday present.</li>
            <li> Well that&#x27;s because it barely brushes the hair.</li>
            <li> My $1 paddle brush from the Dollar Tree works way better than this piece of thin plastic junk.</li>
            <li> It does comb through hair nicely but the bristles are very weak and many on the outside layer have already broken off.  </li>
            <li> Actually the $1.00 hairbrush works much better - less pulling and less hair pulled.</li>
            <li> My 6 year old daughter has really fine hair that tangles and knots very easy making for difficult and painful hair brushing, especially in the winter whenthe climate is very dry adding to static in the air and hair</li>
            <li> My four year old daughter actually saw this commercial and told me that we should get this.</li>
            <li> I wish I hadn’t spent so much money on it as I could have gotten a cheaper brush that does the same thing.</li>
            <li> I saw one of these at my local store (different color but same brand and brush type - for fine hair) hoping to finally have something that would help tame my tangles</li>
            <li> Combing it results in major meltdowns on a daily basis.</li>
            <li> Also, it has strict limitations about not using when wet or to dry your hair so a brush for only one purpose kind of sucks</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first, but the very first time I used it was effortless.</li>
            <li> For myself I can get directly out of shower and brush my long hair without pulling all of my hair out.  </li>
            <li> I have struggled all my life with tangles in thin fine hair.</li>
            <li> they had it at $12.99 by mistake usually $14.99 but gave me the lower marked price and got a bag of chips to complete minimum of $15 to use coupon,</li>
            <li> I have THICK naturally curly hair and a very sensitive scalp.</li>
            <li> My wife like the brush help her tangling hair but hair brush do not last long.</li>
            <li> The bristles are too short and it doesn&#x27;t do anything different from any other brush.</li>
            <li> Do not hesitate to buy, but do know it&#x27;s not perfect in the sense your kid will be free from snags.  </li>
            <li> If your hand is the tiniest bit wet from a styling product, the handle is so short that you will have to hold onto the head of the brush instead.</li>
            <li> My daughter saw this on tv and had to have for her tangled long hair.  </li>
            <li> My daughter had long hair and it always takes me a long time to brush her hair.</li>
            <li> She had long hair and her girl friend had this brush.  </li>
            <li> (it&#x27;s long and she wakes up with it</li>
            <li> She has always had problems with tangles, especially when wet.  </li>
            <li> Our daughter has long hair, and trying to get her to let it be brush was a chore because of the tangles she would get in it.</li>
            <li> She only uses it in the shower while her hair is wet.  </li>
            <li> My daughter has long hair.</li>
            <li> Feels like a cheap pet grooming brush and doesn&#x27;t work on wet, dry, thin, thick or normal hair.</li>
            <li> My daughter is mixed race (black and white).  </li>
            <li> I purchased the pink brush for fine hair and am not impressed.  </li>
            <li> It felt the same as any other brush I would use.</li>
            <li> i was disappointed as the brush is missing one bristle very noticeable on top.</li>
            <li> Secondly, the handle doesn&#x27;t fit well in my hand, and holding the brush is awkward.  </li>
            <li> but  when my hair is dry I use another brush</li>
            <li> The only down side is that it is not too well made she accidentally dropped it on the floor</li>
            <li> Got it at bed bath and beyond today actually they only carty green and blue at store got the green , used $5 coupon discount</li>
            <li> I kept it but only because I was too lazy to send it back!  </li>
            <li> and I can get the brush through her hair with less pulls than a standard brush, but if I then pick up a comb to run through her hair, it&#x27;s as if I had done nothing--plenty of snags still in her hair that this brush just bypassed.  </li>
            <li> I saw this brush in a store, but only for thick hair, which is not her hair type, so I went home and immediately ordered it online as a last resort (after a litany of different conditioners, leave-ins, and other brushes).</li>
            <li> The bristles are already breaking (I&#x27;ve had it for only 2 weeks), my daughter&#x27;s hair is a little easier to get through</li>
            <li> Feels a little harsh on the skin like they could put some soft knobs on the ends.</li>
            <li> not sure how long it will last</li>
            <li> This was not a great brush, she cried the whole time we were brushing her hair, would not recommend.</li>
            <li> My kid has straight , thin hair</li>
            <li> What a total waste of money.  </li>
            <li> As I expected it didn&#x27;t work like advertised.  </li>
            <li> I use it  when detangling my wet hair it works wonders</li>
            <li> I was really hoping it would help because I’m tired of pulling out my hair trying to brush it.</li>
            <li> The Wet Brush]]-</li>
            <li> so you have to press harder to draw the brush through your hair.  </li>
            <li> My 9 year old was so hoping this would be the answer to her thick tangled hair.</li>
            <li> I have a 3 year old with hair down past her butt.</li>
            <li> Gave it 3 stars only because it is pretty flimsy and lightweight - and the handle is awkward when using.</li>
            <li> ; knot in little girls long hair is a &amp;#34;no win&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Im not loseing all my hair like in all the other brushes Ive tried ya gotta get one and try it yourself  </li>
            <li> her hair is not thick or too thin..</li>
            <li> It bends and makes my hair extremely staticy hair</li>
            <li> and once she starts brushing she does not stop which tends to make us later than usual.  </li>
            <li> They need to say does not work on other nationalalities.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s nothing compared to other brushes</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t do what it is suppose to at all the bristles are to small / short</li>
            <li> I will probably try the other size.</li>
            <li> The only criticism I have is that the handle is pretty wide which makes it a little awkward to hold.</li>
            <li> My nine-year-old daughter has very long hair (by her choice), and I was at my end with all the screaming and crying every morning trying to brush it.</li>
            <li> Her hair is so fine that it snarles and tangles badly and this brush works without any pulling and hurting her head.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money, use a brissle brush to comb out the knots....</li>
            <li> &quot; But sadly it did not do even that much.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Short and to the point, NOT worth buying.</li>
            <li> For years, we argue and tussle about brushing her hair and brushed with lots of screaming, taking at least 10minutes of torture for both of us each time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It does not perform any better than a hairbrush I bought for $1.00 which has a flexible base for the bristles.  </li>
            <li> Every other brush we have used for our little girl pulled and hurt her head.  </li>
            <li> She has dark think black hair that gets tangled all the time.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m practically an expert at removing tangles (always brush when dry, from the bottom, small sections, etc) but having a brush accomplish what can take a lot of time appealed to me</li>
            <li> it the bristles are to short to really brush bad knots.  </li>
            <li> the bristles started breaking in half and falling off.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a sad return of the red teary eyes and constant \\&quot;ouches\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I agree there seems to be less breakage</li>
            <li> After bath time and waking up from sleeping or naps leaves their hair a tangled mess.</li>
            <li> The bristles are super super thin, this brush can&#x27;t even brush through thin hair, leave alone untangle!!!!  </li>
            <li> Not even a little</li>
            <li> Detangles with little effort</li>
            <li> I would say the bristles could be just a little bit longer</li>
            <li> Within a few uses a lot of the bristles broke.</li>
            <li> but it darted to break after a few weeks</li>
            <li> This brush makes the crying minimum.</li>
            <li> It was still too harsh for her head.  </li>
            <li> Tried it a few times and it does not do what it promises.  </li>
            <li> I was using a detangling spray for a while, but disliked using chemicals to get the job</li>
            <li> so it SOUNDS harsh if that makes sense.</li>
            <li> Just a waste of money</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> just doesn&#x27;t  work a waste of money</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I was Hoping this brush would help my autistic daughtter where she has head sensitivity</li>
            <li> It was a waste</li>
            <li> but now that&#x27;s missing the bristle I&#x27;ll keep to my self.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sad that a 7 yr old has already learned this harsh lesson.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was very curious to see if it worked, but you know what they say, &amp;#34;curiosity killed the cat&amp;#34;!!</li>
            <li> 7 yr old daughter used to hate getting her hair brushed.</li>
            <li> Putting it back together and getting all the bristles to go back through their respective holes is a nasty exercise in futility.  </li>
            <li> The bristles are small plastic bristles</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed on the money I spent &amp; hoping to get half of it back</li>
            <li> My 6 year old daughter has tight curls that often get badly tangled.</li>
            <li> This was a big disappointment for such an expensive brush.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s basically hard plastic.</li>
            <li> Hopefully, with use, the tips of the bristles will dull a bit.</li>
            <li> I was sceptical when receiving this brush because I noticed that the bristles looked a little flimsy but it works!!</li>
            <li> but at least it rocks the one thing it does.</li>
            <li> Anything to help!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am sorry that I spent the money on it.</li>
            <li> My daughter has thick hair that has always been a battle to take care of.</li>
            <li> have really thick wavy hair and have never had a tangle issue, but my twins are 2 and their hair is stick</li>
            <li> I mean...</li>
            <li> She was very disappointed to learn that I was right.</li>
            <li> My daughter saw commercial for this product and wanted it soooo bad.</li>
            <li> Bought this off the tv and so sorry I wasted my money.  </li>
            <li> I was babysitting her while she was sick at home, and a commercial came up  </li>
            <li> I would expect for $20 that the brush bristles would NOT break after a few uses and that it would work as advertised!!!</li>
            <li> No more tears!!</li>
            <li> I even switched to brushing her hair in thin sections</li>
            <li> This brush is absolute crap!</li>
            <li> This brush does not help either one of these issues and this was a waste of money and a disappointment.</li>
            <li> Alas though this brush did NOTHING to quell my tangled mane.</li>
            <li> All she got was a lesson in false advertising and things not always being what they seem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It does NOT detangle, it pulls your hair, its design is awkward and hard to grip.</li>
            <li> This is by far the worst brush I have ever owned.</li>
            <li> Very difficult to hold the brush, the handle is very small and uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical but my wife wanted it.</li>
            <li> Lame product.</li>
            <li> I am not impressed with this &#x27;detangling brush&#x27;.  </li>
            <li> If I had a to pick something wrong with it</li>
            <li> Sorry</li>
            <li> If anyone has tips on using it please share them with me, perhaps I am using it wrong?</li>
            <li> Now... anyone with a daughter knows how difficult it is to brush their hair whatever length it may be.</li>
            <li> This brush was the worst 15 bucks I have ever spent.</li>
            <li> Another disappointment from &amp;#34;as seen on TV&amp;#34; don&#x27;t bother with it.  </li>
            <li> but it tangles like crazy..</li>
            <li> Disappointing.</li>
            <li> It is horrible like trying to brush hair with a steel wool doesn&#x27;t go through thick hair.</li>
            <li> I am disappointed in quality and performance.</li>
            <li> its sad!!</li>
            <li> Worthless doesn&#x27;t work at all</li>
            <li> My child wanted this brush so very bad.</li>
            <li> and it is terrible to get a comb/brush through her hair.</li>
            <li> This product is horrible.</li>
            <li> but this brush made it horrible.</li>
            <li> Worst purchase I have ever made!!</li>
            <li> Horrible product.</li>
            <li> and I felt horrible</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> LOVE IT!! One of the best things I ever bought. I would recommend this to anyone with fine hair.</li>
            <li> I have THICK naturally curly hair and a very sensitive scalp. I have always used a wide-toothed comb and a regular brush...combing my hair had always been a NIGHTMARE!!! I purchased this brush 2 weeks ago and absolutely love it!! I was skeptical at first, but the very first time I used it was effortless. Absolutely amazing product!</li>
            <li> Works really well.  It have dropped it many times and it hasn&#x27;t broke at all.  Really well made and works great on my hair.</li>
            <li> It works as advertised. I was skeptical but my wife wanted it. Worth every penny but how many words can you write about a hairbrush?</li>
            <li> We bought two of these brushes: one for fine one for normal. My daughter has long naturally curly hair that is super fine but a lot of it. Within a few uses a lot of the bristles broke. It would get snagged on the knots. Plus the brushes were full of hair! So much for the claim that \\&quot;no hair is in the brush\\&quot;. That only works if you have already brushed the hair. I even switched to brushing her hair in thin sections so it took 15 minutes just to brush out her hair and there was still a lot of hair in the brush. I also have naturally curly hair but thicker. My hair does not tangle into knots like hers but even my brush came out with lots of hair. I would expect for $20 that the brush bristles would NOT break after a few uses and that it would work as advertised!!!</li>
            <li> prefect saves a lot of time going though those tangles</li>
            <li> it really does work! (from my 6yr.old!)</li>
            <li> This worked well for my 10 year old daughter. . . until it was dropped.  Putting it back together and getting all the bristles to go back through their respective holes is a nasty exercise in futility.  Now it&#x27;s at perhaps 60%.  Still useful, but not as it was.  If I had another, I&#x27;d probably run a bead of viscous super glue around the perimeter before the inevitable drop.</li>
            <li> The brush did work on untangled my sis hair but it darted to break after a few weeks but it did the job I bought it for</li>
            <li> Where have you been all my life?  The best part is that it doesn&#x27;t hurt to get the tangles out. I have fine hair that easily tangles and a tender head, so I really dig this brush. I see that some reviews say it stops working in two months, but I haven&#x27;t had that problem. The only criticism I have is that the handle is pretty wide which makes it a little awkward to hold.</li>
            <li> This brush is absolute crap! Feels like a cheap pet grooming brush and doesn&#x27;t work on wet, dry, thin, thick or normal hair. If your hand is the tiniest bit wet from a styling product, the handle is so short that you will have to hold onto the head of the brush instead. Both of my daughters complain that the &amp;#34;TV commercial lied to them&amp;#34;.  Lesson learned.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really de-tangle my daughter&#x27;s fine hair as well as advertised. It&#x27;s like a normal brush that pulls and hurts.</li>
            <li> Lame product. Another disappointment from &amp;#34;as seen on TV&amp;#34; don&#x27;t bother with it.  The bristles are too short and it doesn&#x27;t do anything different from any other brush.</li>
            <li> So I got this brush for a seven year old with more hair than anyone I know. Her hair is constantly tangled after having it up in a pony tail or braid. It&#x27;s great to get the knots out without hurting, or using a lot lot of force to get the knots out. I do need suggestions on a stay in conditioner if anyone has any?</li>
            <li> Product as described. Works great Not really for thick hair though</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work AT ALL. Hurts my daughter even more than her old brush.</li>
            <li> Wow! I bought this for my dog. He loves this brush (previous kinds were not so welcome). I bought a second one for my son&#x27;s dog, who hates to get brushed, and she stood still for it. I know it&#x27;s a people brush, but ought to be marketed for pets also.</li>
            <li> My daughter has very knotty hair due to static from her school uniform so we thought this brush would \\&quot;brush\\&quot; through the knots. Not even a little it the bristles are to short to really brush bad knots.  We did like the brush because it does not hurt her as much on that part it is a good brush.  My overall thought on the brush is it would be great on fine shorter hair but not meant for tough knots or tangles on long hair.</li>
            <li> hey this brush works! Im not loseing all my hair like in all the other brushes Ive tried ya gotta get one and try it yourself  ya  really be surprized !!!</li>
            <li> Had high hopes for &amp;#34;no more tears&amp;#34;.  Still that constant &amp;#34;bedHead&amp;#34; knot in little girls long hair is a &amp;#34;no win&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I was losing an exorbitant amount of hair and this brush has helped to reduce the amount of hair loss. Thank you for this most efficient brush.</li>
            <li> My daughter saw this on tv and had to have for her tangled long hair.  It is horrible like trying to brush hair with a steel wool doesn&#x27;t go through thick hair.</li>
            <li> It does what it says it would do.  I gave the product a four for two reasons. The first being, I like to wash my brushes once a week so this product isn&#x27;t best for that because the water gets inside of the brush.  The second,  after a month or two of use the bristles started breaking in half and falling off.</li>
            <li> My 7 year old daughter loves this brush</li>
            <li> My 4 yrs old daughter now tolerates having her hair brushed/detangled without screaming the entire time. Detangles with little effort &amp; it&#x27;s my daughter&#x27;s favorite brush thus far!</li>
            <li> I am not impressed with this &#x27;detangling brush&#x27;.  It does not perform any better than a hairbrush I bought for $1.00 which has a flexible base for the bristles.  Actually the $1.00 hairbrush works much better - less pulling and less hair pulled.</li>
            <li> I bought 2 of these; one for each granddaughter. they both have fine hair and get up every morning with tangles and they scream when you try to brush even if you use a detangler spray. These brushes are great and we usually don&#x27;t need the detangler; some mornings - some detangler is still necessary.</li>
            <li> Great for long fine hair, but stupendous for folks with arthritis in their shoulders who want to keep their hair long.</li>
            <li> Brush feels cheap, plastic. Doesn&#x27;t seem to untangle much better than my regular hair brush. I use it though, it&#x27;s an ok brush, just not what I expected really.</li>
            <li> Works very well with my long hair</li>
            <li> My four year old daughter actually saw this commercial and told me that we should get this. She has very fine hair and it is terrible to get a comb/brush through her hair. This was not a great brush, she cried the whole time we were brushing her hair, would not recommend.</li>
            <li> It so nice on my hair</li>
            <li> My 10 year old daughter wanted this for a birthday present. I explained to her nothing ever works like it does in the commercials, but she insisted. She was very disappointed to learn that I was right. This product is horrible. I can see why it says it makes it so there are no tangles. Well that&#x27;s because it barely brushes the hair. My kid has straight , thin hair but this doesn&#x27;t go through it. I have a niece who bought one too and it was for thicker hair and same thing. Doesn&#x27;t do anything it says it does. Do not recommend</li>
            <li> For long fine hair they are the best I have ever had and my hair is easy to comb with them.</li>
            <li> My hair is medium length and straight with a decent amount of tangles so I thought this brush would help that and my hair being pulled out while brushing it. This brush does not help either one of these issues and this was a waste of money and a disappointment.</li>
            <li> I really love the entangling brush for fine hair.  It really decreases hair loss from tangles that tear your hair apart.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves it. Got it for her birthday - she&#x27;s 4 and asked for this. It works without hurting as advertised.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work well at all.  Pulled hair rather than detangling. Daughter cried. We are using it on the horses Instead</li>
            <li> My daughter had long hair and it always takes me a long time to brush her hair. This brush makes the crying minimum.</li>
            <li> Seems cheaply made but my daughters prefer this brush</li>
            <li> I have struggled all my life with tangles in thin fine hair. In recent years reducing use of chemicals, so fineness is truly silky and easily tangled. This brush is exquisite; glides right through wet hair after shower, and dry hair first thing in the morning --then windblown or hat-hair. Woohoo!</li>
            <li> What a total waste of money.  This grabs my daughter&#x27;s fine hair and won&#x27;t let go.  I am disappointed in quality and performance.</li>
            <li> This brush is amazing!!  Every other brush we have used for our little girl pulled and hurt her head.  Her hair is so fine that it snarles and tangles badly and this brush works without any pulling and hurting her head.</li>
            <li> I got this for my six year old daughter that has straight long hair and her hair is not thick or too thin.. but it tangles like crazy.. it worked wonders..  I was able to brush her hair without tears or a fight. The only down side is that it is not too well made she accidentally dropped it on the floor and it spilt in two and that was that... I gave it five stars for its ability to do what it says.. but I would not give it that for the quality of how it is made.</li>
            <li> I was sceptical when receiving this brush because I noticed that the bristles looked a little flimsy but it works!! My 6 year old daughter has tight curls that often get badly tangled. With an ordinary brush, she gives screaming matches but honestly the first few brushes through her hair with this brush, she says &amp;#34;not bad!!&amp;#34;. Only brush I use now.</li>
            <li> What I like about this product: it has a handle.  It does comb through hair nicely but the bristles are very weak and many on the outside layer have already broken off.  I will be ordering another tangle teezer instead.</li>
            <li> This was a joke! It bends and makes my hair extremely staticy hair, I live in a dry area and my hair is normally fine but this brush made it horrible.</li>
            <li> Got it at bed bath and beyond today actually they only carty green and blue at store got the green , used $5 coupon discount they had it at $12.99 by mistake usually $14.99 but gave me the lower marked price and got a bag of chips to complete minimum of $15 to use coupon, got it at a decent price, works fine on my baby but bristles feel very cheap bend easily just by playing with it not sure how long it will last I&#x27;m happy so far</li>
            <li> This is by far the worst brush I have ever owned. I paid $20 for this at Walgreens. My daughter has thick hair that has always been a battle to take care of. That being said we bought this brush thinking it would help our lives and it does nothing out pull her hair out of her head. Worst purchase I have ever made!!</li>
            <li> My child wanted this brush so very bad. They had advertised it over and over and over... She has long fine hair that tangles easily.  I had my doubts but found one at a local store&#x27;s &amp;#34;as seen on TV display&amp;#34;, so we tried it.  As I expected it didn&#x27;t work like advertised.  It was still too harsh for her head.  It&#x27;s basically hard plastic. But, my cats will follow me anywhere if I have this brush. They love it. So my cats got a great new brush...my kid, not so much.</li>
            <li> Tried it a few times and it does not do what it promises.  I kept it but only because I was too lazy to send it back!  Not worth the money, use a brissle brush to comb out the knots....long, fine hair.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t even deserve one star!! Should be a zero. My 9 year old was so hoping this would be the answer to her thick tangled hair. All she got was a lesson in false advertising and things not always being what they seem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She cried more in the first two minutes of taking the brush out of the box and to her hair than she ever did with a regular brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SAVE YOUR MONEY!!!</li>
            <li> I love this brush. I can brush my hair, which gets very tangled as It is very fine.  I pull the brush through my hair and it doesn&#x27;t hurt!! This is a really big plus.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t like it. Doesn&#x27;t work any better then a normal brush.</li>
            <li> for my Schnauzer dog...seems to work on his fine hair</li>
            <li> Worthless doesn&#x27;t work at all</li>
            <li> not as good as it shows on tv</li>
            <li> Does as it promised! Does not knot up my hair and I can easily brush through it!</li>
            <li> So gentle and amazing at detangling!</li>
            <li> Might be a great brush for some, but it didn&#x27;t work for me. I have long fine hair, it tangles when I blow dry it, this brush didn&#x27;t help detangle it. And it isn&#x27;t inexpensive either.</li>
            <li> I got this for both myself and my daughter.  She is only 5 and once she starts brushing she does not stop which tends to make us later than usual.  For myself I can get directly out of shower and brush my long hair without pulling all of my hair out.  I also tend to put my hair up in a messy bun and am able to comb it in the morning and have no problems or pulling.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t buy mine off Amazon, but grabbed it off the shelf at a store after seeing it on TV. I should have come here and read the reviews first. They never let you down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have really thick wavy hair and have never had a tangle issue, but my twins are 2 and their hair is stick straight and baby fine. They don&#x27;t have a lot of it, either. After bath time and waking up from sleeping or naps leaves their hair a tangled mess. I was using a detangling spray for a while, but disliked using chemicals to get the job done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I tried this brush. All I was hoping was to not hurt their heads while I brushed their hair. It didn&#x27;t have to be fast or leave their hair looking salon fabulous, just didn&#x27;t have to hurt and cause \\&quot;brushing squirm.\\&quot; But sadly it did not do even that much. I can&#x27;t even use it because it doesn&#x27;t really reach my scalp, so I guess I&#x27;ll clean it and offer it to someone else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Back to the drawing board.</li>
            <li> Just the thing for fine hair. Bought this for my daughter to use with her wig (cancer) and it takes all the tangles out. Works great in natural hair also.</li>
            <li> My niece to whom I gave thinks it&#x27;s miraculous.</li>
            <li> This works really good.  I am not tearing my hair out any longer.  The longer your hair, the more you&#x27;ll notice how great this brush works.</li>
            <li> Works great detangling my long over bleached tangled mess of hair. Would highly recommend. If I had a to pick something wrong with it I would say the bristles could be just a little bit longer but it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li> Must only work on white people hair. They need to say does not work on other nationalalities.</li>
            <li> Love love love this brush! Got it for my 5 year old, 30 dollars at a salon. Its very gentle, but its loud so it SOUNDS harsh if that makes sense. We love this brush</li>
            <li> Truly does not pull hair as advertised.</li>
            <li> Definitely helps detangle my very fine, tangly hair without getting stuck or causing too much pain.</li>
            <li> It scratches the scalp, not massages as advertised.</li>
            <li> Out of the box this product worked! My 6 year old daughter has really fine hair that tangles and knots very easy making for difficult and painful hair brushing, especially in the winter whenthe climate is very dry adding to static in the air and hair knotting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We tried: different brushes and combs; brushing the hair before and after shower; spray in conditione. Nothing worked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush worked by: easily brushing thru my daughters fine hair; smoothing out any potential knots and made a 40 minute process of brushing into 5 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Emson!</li>
            <li> broke very soon after purchase.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my grand-daughter who is 9.  She had long hair and her girl friend had this brush.  She tried it and loved it.  I was babysitting her while she was sick at home, and a commercial came up  She raved about it, and I bought it on the spot on my phone without her knowledge.  I won best grandma of the month.  lol</li>
            <li> I bought the brushes, one for fine hair and one for medium hair, after my kids begged me for them for about a year.  First of all, there&#x27;s no noticeable difference between the fine and medium hair brush.  Secondly, the handle doesn&#x27;t fit well in my hand, and holding the brush is awkward.  And what&#x27;s with the \\&quot;replace every 8 months\\&quot;? That wasn&#x27;t anywhere on the website.  Why would I replace something like this?  I have brushes in my drawer from 10 years ago...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Short and to the point, NOT worth buying.</li>
            <li> My daughter has tried so many different types of brushes.  She has dark think black hair that gets tangled all the time.  Out of all the ones she tried this is the only one she tolerates.  It&#x27;s not going to be completely smooth or painfree but the results are better than the other stuff out there.  Do not hesitate to buy, but do know it&#x27;s not perfect in the sense your kid will be free from snags.  Once she gets use to the lessen pain level then she wont complain it is a good buy.  It was far better than the crying she did before so I am happy.</li>
            <li> Bought this off the tv and so sorry I wasted my money.  The bristles are already breaking (I&#x27;ve had it for only 2 weeks), my daughter&#x27;s hair is a little easier to get through (it&#x27;s long and she wakes up with it looking like it&#x27;s been in the blender all night) but it&#x27;s not what it promised on the tv.  I&#x27;m disappointed on the money I spent &amp; hoping to get half of it back (less s&amp;h I&#x27;m sure).  I got stuck ordering 2 sets by accident since it lets you pick your brushes with a quantity but no where on the website did it state that each quantity you order, you&#x27;ll get a set of the same brush.  I just wanted 1 normal one and 1 fine one, thus the buy one get one free.  I ended up with 2 of both plus I paid for express shipping and didn&#x27;t get it in the timeframe they stated I would.  Just a waste of money and I still have my daughter upset with brushing her hair in the morning.  I&#x27;m going to give the Smoobie Brush a try &amp; pray that this one will do the \\&quot;job\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I use it  when detangling my wet hair it works wonders but  when my hair is dry I use another brush</li>
            <li> This brush works pretty good. It works much better if you use a good conditioner or detangling spray along with it. I found using my Redkin All Soft got the best results with the brush. It&#x27;s not a miracle brush, but it helps enough to have made it worth the price.</li>
            <li> Why pay $30 when you can go to the official no tangle brush  website [...] and get two for 14.95 plus 5.98 s&amp;H So 2 for $21 or order here one for $30. Sorry Im getting two and saving ten bucks.</li>
            <li> My nine-year-old daughter has very long hair (by her choice), and I was at my end with all the screaming and crying every morning trying to brush it. I saw this brush in a store, but only for thick hair, which is not her hair type, so I went home and immediately ordered it online as a last resort (after a litany of different conditioners, leave-ins, and other brushes). She says, this morning, &amp;#34;My hair is so smooth, and it didn&#x27;t even hurt!&amp;#34; She LOVES the brush. Her hair is smooth and neat. And she might even brush her own hair, now. Phew!</li>
            <li> The bristles are super super thin, this brush can&#x27;t even brush through thin hair, leave alone untangle!!!!  Don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> It still rips some of your hair out but it&#x27;s nothing compared to other brushes</li>
            <li> came on time and wprk great.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I didn’t find that this brush worked any better with helping my knotty hair. It felt the same as any other brush I would use. I was really hoping it would help because I’m tired of pulling out my hair trying to brush it. My sons use this brush too and they don’t even like it for their short hair. I wish I hadn’t spent so much money on it as I could have gotten a cheaper brush that does the same thing. Maybe it will work for some, but it hasn’t worked for me. If anyone has tips on using it please share them with me, perhaps I am using it wrong?</li>
            <li> Does not go through the hair as it was said it was suppose to! I was very curious to see if it worked, but you know what they say, &amp;#34;curiosity killed the cat&amp;#34;!!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care for the brush I bought 2 different ones and it doesn&#x27;t do what it is suppose to at all the bristles are to small / short and it doesn&#x27;t detangel it gets the same amount of hair on the brush and over all just doesn&#x27;t  work a waste of money</li>
            <li> it arrived on time just doesnt take out  tangles much easier than a regular brush, It doesnt pull on them just kind of skips over them</li>
            <li> I actually bought this to try on my Maltese that has fine hair and tangles easy, this brush works very well without pulling!</li>
            <li> Horrible product. It does not work.</li>
            <li> Disappointing. Did not work like it did on the video. Works just like s regular brush, nothing special. Do not recommend.</li>
            <li> i bought it because the wife and my 5 years old daughter loved how its comfortable when they using it</li>
            <li> I manage to get my hair into astonishing tangles with some of my messy up-dos and super curly hairstyles. I&#x27;m practically an expert at removing tangles (always brush when dry, from the bottom, small sections, etc) but having a brush accomplish what can take a lot of time appealed to me so I bought one. I have thick fine hair and was full of gorgeous knots when I tried this out and WOW! It completely worked! It got out 99% of the tangles (a few stubborn ones kept re-tangling after brushing) but overall it was a win. It was also virtually pain free which I loved. I didn&#x27;t brush my hair very differently, it worked well both starting near the bottom and working up AND brushing regularly from the top. It doesn&#x27;t leave your hair silky smooth like brushing with a &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; brush or this would have been a 5 star. Also, it has strict limitations about not using when wet or to dry your hair so a brush for only one purpose kind of sucks but at least it rocks the one thing it does.</li>
            <li> The brush is okay, but wasn&#x27;t as effective as I had hoped.  It didn&#x27;t do any better than my regular brush.</li>
            <li> My wife says this really works.  She doesn&#x27;t have the problems with pulling and tugging that she had with a regular brush.  Recommended!</li>
            <li> I got this for my granddaughter, who has long fine hair.  She has always had problems with tangles, especially when wet.  She loves this brush.</li>
            <li> My wife has thin, very fine hair and this brush works well  at giving the look of more body and fullness without pulling or breaking her hair like many other brushes she&#x27;s tried, She is very happy with it.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my grand daughter and she loves it.</li>
            <li> I had to edit my review as it just doesn&#x27;t work as well anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the packaging it says to replace every 8 months... what!?! I don&#x27;t remember reading that anywhere in the description posted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It worked fantastically for about 2 months (as noted by another reviewer) but now it&#x27;s just an oversized brush that hurts her when brushing again.  It&#x27;s a sad return of the red teary eyes and constant \\&quot;ouches\\&quot;. She&#x27;s since begged me to look for another detangling brush... something not from the tv. It&#x27;s sad that a 7 yr old has already learned this harsh lesson.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure if there was some kind of film on the bristles that eventually wore off or what.  For $15, it should do what it says for longer than 2 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found another brush to try ([[ASIN:B000L596FE The Wet Brush]]- it has pretty good reviews).  I just ordered it today (Mar 3/13).  I&#x27;ll post a review after a month of using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*******************************************&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My original review of the pink Micheal Mercier brush is below. I gave it 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My 7 yr old daughter used to hate getting her hair brushed. I&#x27;ll never know how her hair gets so knotty while sleeping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Her eyes would always get red and occasionally a tear would escape while I was brushing as carefully as possible. It really hurt her and I felt horrible everytime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When she saw the infomercial for Michel Mercier&#x27;s Ultimate Detangler she begged me to order it. She even insisted she use her birthday money to pay for it. I was hesitant since I don&#x27;t trust infomercials.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Low and behold, it works fantastically! She actually brushes her own hair now after her shower, before school and even several times in-between. She never has \\&quot;homeless person\\&quot; hair anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brush has saved me a good 30 mins a day of delicate hair brushing and heartbreaking tears.</li>
            <li> My hair is thinning as I get older. This brush  detangles without pain and hair loss. Best brush I ever owned.</li>
            <li> My daughter runs from me every time I pick up a hair brush to brush her hair.  She saw the commercial for this and wanted one immediately.  I looked at reviews for this and other supposed detangling brushes and decided this one probably had the best chance of working.  Well, it doesn&#x27;t.  It&#x27;s true that there are lots and lots of bristles of different lengths and I can get the brush through her hair with less pulls than a standard brush, but if I then pick up a comb to run through her hair, it&#x27;s as if I had done nothing--plenty of snags still in her hair that this brush just bypassed.  I&#x27;ve taken to using this to start brushing her hair, and then use a regular brush afterwards to get out the snags this one ignored. This was a big disappointment for such an expensive brush.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I purchased the pink brush for fine hair and am not impressed.  The bristles are small plastic bristles so you have to press harder to draw the brush through your hair.  The hairbrush is made of cheap, hard pressed plastic so when you use it actually makes a sort of thudding sound as you brush through your hair.  I agree there seems to be less breakage but I don’t believe the brush actually goes through as much hair, definitely more work.</li>
            <li> I was Hoping this brush would help my autistic daughtter where she has head sensitivity but it hurt her so i no longer use it . It was a waste o money for me.</li>
            <li> Our daughter has long hair, and trying to get her to let it be brush was a chore because of the tangles she would get in it. Since we have gotten this brush she is constantly brushing her own hair, and does not have a problem with us brushing her hair because it does not pull and hurt like normal brushes do. Heck, the wife likes it so much that we will be ordering her one as well.</li>
            <li> Not as good as I was hoping for</li>
            <li> My daughter is mixed race (black and white).  We bought the blue brush.  It is rather light weight plastic, and buying it at BB&amp;B, we didn&#x27;t get a second free.  She has gorgeous, spiral curly hair and this brush has made detangling it a breeze!  She only uses it in the shower while her hair is wet.  It is a tiny bit frizzy when she gets out, but a quick once over with a wide tooth comb and the frizziness is gone.  So easy, my eight year old is doing her own curly hair!</li>
            <li> This brush was the worst 15 bucks I have ever spent. Don&#x27;t bother buying it. As always, the commercial made it look awesome, but that couldn&#x27;t be further from the truth. This brush ripped my freakin hair out (when its main selling point is that it  supposedly pulls less hair out while brushing) It does NOT detangle, it pulls your hair, its design is awkward and hard to grip. All around crappy product. Thankfully Amazon refunded my money. I&#x27;d give this product - 5 stars if I could. My $1 paddle brush from the Dollar Tree works way better than this piece of thin plastic junk.</li>
            <li> Very difficult to hold the brush, the handle is very small and uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> The hairbrush worked well for tangles, but the commercial said it would not be full of hair. All people shed hair so it was no surprise that it was full of hair. I probably should have used the one for thicker hair. Feels a little harsh on the skin like they could put some soft knobs on the ends. I will probably try the other size.</li>
            <li> My daughter has long hair. Now... anyone with a daughter knows how difficult it is to brush their hair whatever length it may be. I mean...its sad!! This was the best purchase EVER!!! No more tears!! Yay!!</li>
            <li> It is made of cheap plastic that had to be put together when I first got it. it does not work well at all. The Wet brush is much better.</li>
            <li> I have long hair and the ends tend to tangle quickly - this brush is great for quick untangling. Gave it 3 stars only because it is pretty flimsy and lightweight - and the handle is awkward when using.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with this brush, yea no tangles in my hair.</li>
            <li> The tips of the bristles are a bit sharp, however, it does a wonderful job of removing the tangles.  Hopefully, with use, the tips of the bristles will dull a bit.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair that is a tangled mess- it&#x27;s always been tangly and knotted since I was a child- to the point that I use to run and hide when it came time to brush my hair.  I saw one of these at my local store (different color but same brand and brush type - for fine hair) hoping to finally have something that would help tame my tangles and I gladly paid for it. Anything to help!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am sorry that I spent the money on it. The brush quality itself feels extremely cheap yet the prince is nothing but cheap.  Still- I held out hope that I had a cure to my tangled problem.  Alas though this brush did NOTHING to quell my tangled mane. I definitely do NOT recommend.</li>
            <li> Great brush! Works as advertised!</li>
            <li> Excellent product !!!!</li>
            <li> I have a 3 year old with hair down past her butt. Combing it results in major meltdowns on a daily basis. I have and will try ANYTHING to make the process a more enjoyable experience for the both of us. This brush is not the answer. It&#x27;s going in our rather large box of other products that were sure to be the answer to our problem. Save your money and your daughter the pain!!!</li>
            <li> I have 2 daughters with fine hair that is often tangled. We own this brush, the wet brush and the knot genie. This is probably my least favorite of the three (the wet brush is my favorite). I never feel like I am really getting all the way through their hair when I&#x27;m brushing.</li>
            <li> i was disappointed as the brush is missing one bristle very noticeable on top. I was planing to sent it as a gift but now that&#x27;s missing the bristle I&#x27;ll keep to my self. Anyway the brush is confortable to detangle the hair.</li>
            <li> My teen daughter swears it goes right through her tangles. She has long, fine hair. Used to rip through it with another brush. Now I don&#x27;t hear that frightful sound! Plastic feels super cheap, so I&#x27;m not sure how durable this product is - time will tell - but it does what it says it will for now!</li>
            <li> Great hair brush, I am 55 years young and always have had problems after washing my hair I had tangles, this brush does the trick for getting out tangles and no hair pulling...ouch less....wonderful product, and I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Loved my brush so much bought 3 more as gifts!</li>
            <li> My wife like the brush help her tangling hair but hair brush do not last long.</li>
            <li> My daughter saw commercial for this product and wanted it soooo bad. I bought it for her, as soon as she tried to use it, it pulled at her hair. Stick with regular brushes. There is nothing special about this except it will pull your hair out and hurts!</li>
            <li> Exceptional product, great value</li>
            <li> My 8yo daughter has always screamed from hair brushing since the age of 2yo.  She has tangled fine hair that cannot be combed even with fingers.  For years, we argue and tussle about brushing her hair and brushed with lots of screaming, taking at least 10minutes of torture for both of us each time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is one amazing brush that gets her to comb her own hair and quietly!  Yes, it is true that the brush does not go all the way through to the other side.  So, in order to do a really good job of brushing hair, you must brush the top of the hair and then brush underneath on the other side also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, no screaming and being able to just remind my daughter to brush her own hair, which she is able to do in less than 1 minute by herself....this brush rates 5 stars from a grateful mom!!!!</li>
