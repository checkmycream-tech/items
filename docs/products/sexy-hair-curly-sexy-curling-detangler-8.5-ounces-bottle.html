            <li>This is a great product for wavy or curly hair.</li>
            <li>some reason, I tend to get knots in my hair at the nape of my neck, and this works great as a detangler.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It is great at undoing tangles and improves hair&#x27;s feel.  </li>
            <li>This is a great product.</li>
            <li>This product is absolutley amazing!  </li>
            <li>It smells good and does detangle</li>
            <li>I sure hope not because these products work the best on my hair....much better than Paul Mitchell.</li>
            <li>then but it&#x27;s MUCH better!</li>
            <li>This detangler works great and is worth the price to me.</li>
            <li>I am very glad to have found it available through Amazon.</li>
            <li>It also softens, defrizzes and eliminates static electricity.</li>
            <li>My hair is already sexy and curly, so I thought this might make it even better.  </li>
            <li>I love getting it on Amazon Prime,</li>
            <li>I LOVE it.</li>
            <li>its ok, cant find it in stores anymore  but does well for detangles of curly hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad to have that option.</li>
            <li>I heard that the Curly Sexy Hair line was being discontinued....</li>
            <li>Only reason I didn&#x27;t give this detangler 5 stars is because it would be nice if it could have a more pleasant fruity or flowery scent.</li>
            <li>You will love this product if you have fine hair that tangles.</li>
            <li>perfect for my daughters super curly and long hair.</li>
            <li>I have fine, curly hair that tangles so easily.</li>
            <li>Love the light mist and smells nice, does not leave hair stick or looking like layered in product and curls and soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>Nothing special about the scent.</li>
            <li>I can comb right through it!</li>
            <li>It smells good and does detangle, but I would recommend using only with conditioner.</li>
            <li>Now her hair is pretty easy to brush.</li>
            <li>The scent is not bad, it&#x27;s just kind of similar to the scent of hairspray type products.</li>
            <li>right to my door.</li>
            <li>Light leave in, but still leaves hair frizzy in high humidity.</li>
            <li>It allows me to easily comb through my hair while keeping it soft and manageable.  </li>
            <li>I have long, curly hair that tangles very easily.</li>
            <li>However, this new spray bottle is WAY better than the old one!</li>
            <li>Price on Amazon was better than local drug store.  </li>
            <li>It smells great, does an amazing job at detangling the crazy knots I have in my thick curly hair, and makes the curls look nice and soft and frizz free!</li>
            <li>I love this stuff for my long, permed hair.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li>My 2.5 year old mixed daughter has really curly hair, and myself I don&#x27;t have as much as a wave in my own hair.</li>
            <li>But again not what I was really looking for.  </li>
            <li>My hair gets very tangled no matter how much shampoo/conditioner I use in the shower so this leave in detangler is a must for me.</li>
            <li>Thanks for providing a source for it.</li>
            <li>It really didn&#x27;t enhance my hair type in any way.  </li>
            <li>Even though it&#x27;s a detangler, I noticed that it doesn&#x27;t really detangle unless I already used conditioner.</li>
            <li>May be better for other hair types.  </li>
            <li>First of all, I have naturally curly hair</li>
            <li>I often ride in my Jeep Wrangler with the top down</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t particularly like the smell of the product either.  </li>
            <li>Several years ago I found this detangler in a CVS store and was amazed at how quickly it detangles hair - practically instantaneously.</li>
            <li>Love this product, it detangles easily and makes hair feel soft but doesn&#x27;t have a cloying, strong or unpleasant scent.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s great and unfortunately seems to be discontinued.</li>
            <li>I have very fine, very dry, very curly hair that grows very long and tangles if you look at it.</li>
            <li>I curl my straight hair using a little spray before curling it at night and it keeps my curls done; and they last more tan one day after.  </li>
            <li>It is light and doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down.</li>
            <li>If this describes your hair, I would highly recommend trying this product to keep it tame, moisturized, tangle free, and under control.</li>
            <li>I had hoped that it would work on my 6 year old granddaughter as a detangler.  </li>
            <li>I started using this after every wash, in addition to another leave in spray from Pravana, and my hair really does feel different now.  </li>
            <li>the tangles come right out with a wide tooth comb.</li>
            <li>I use it on wet hair right after shampooing to get out any tangles.</li>
            <li>Spray works ok, less tangles, but also less curls.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> I don&#x27;t brush my hair because it will only get fuzzy and about 2 feet wide.</li>
            <li> A few sprays of this product after a shower and WOW</li>
            <li> At night I use it sparingly on dry hair, brush through to moisturize, and get out any tangles that happened during the day.</li>
            <li> Not new to this product</li>
            <li> I will never live without this spray and would recommend it to all who ride cycle, boat and ride in convertibles or just have snarly hair.</li>
            <li> I perm my hair to get some life,volume and loose curls.  </li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;m letting it grow and wearing it loose every day.</li>
            <li> For several years I was not able to buy this detangler because it was no longer being sold through my local stores.</li>
            <li> I was about to cut my 6 year old&#x27;s long thick wavy hair until I tried this, combined with the Chi dentangling brush.</li>
            <li> If you want curls, I would suggest combing it through wet hair and leaving your hair loose to dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> When I spritz this detangler in my hair, it only takes a few minutes to comb out my tangles.</li>
            <li> It is less curly and frizzier then when I use other detangling sprays or curl products.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t grease my hair down like some products do.</li>
            <li> With this product, however, I washed my daughter&#x27;s hair, sprayed it with the detangler, and combed thru her hair with little to no snags..</li>
            <li> We still have a few screams now and</li>
            <li> I often wear it in a messy bun which encourages snarls.</li>
            <li> and I wear it curly everyday.</li>
            <li> but I find that there are less expensive products out there that does the same thing.</li>
            <li> This has drastically improved the feel of my hair which had been dried out from excessive highlighting/coloring.  </li>
            <li> It was a failure on her thick curly hair.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I was very disappointed!</li>

            <li> This is a great product for wavy or curly hair. Love the light mist and smells nice, does not leave hair stick or looking like layered in product and curls and soft and smooth. Best product out there I have tried for wavy hair.</li>
            <li> Price on Amazon was better than local drug store.  Spray works ok, less tangles, but also less curls.  I don&#x27;t notice any additional softness after using it.  Nothing special about the scent.</li>
            <li> perfect for my daughters super curly and long hair.</li>
            <li> But again not what I was really looking for.  Didn&#x27;t particularly like the smell of the product either.  Thus I will not purchase again</li>
            <li> Love this product, it detangles easily and makes hair feel soft but doesn&#x27;t have a cloying, strong or unpleasant scent.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff for my long, permed hair.&lt;br /&gt;For some reason, I tend to get knots in my hair at the nape of my neck, and this works great as a detangler.&lt;br /&gt;I simply spritz after washing my hair and comb through with a rake.  It also softens, defrizzes and eliminates static electricity.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t do it for me or my daughter.  We have two different hair textures.  Not sure why the ratings are so high.</li>
            <li> It smells great, does an amazing job at detangling the crazy knots I have in my thick curly hair, and makes the curls look nice and soft and frizz free!</li>

The scent is not bad, it&#x27;s just kind of similar to the scent of hairspray type products. I prefer a lighter scent.</li>
            <li> You will love this product if you have fine hair that tangles.</li>
            <li> THIS WORKS AWESOME!!!</li>
            <li> In love with all their products!!!! Recommend it to all curly haired girls!!</li>
            <li> Light leave in, but still leaves hair frizzy in high humidity.</li>

            <li> Product arrived on time, as promised.  I&#x27;m very satisfied!</li>
            <li> My hair is already sexy and curly, so I thought this might make it even better.  I was disappointed.  It really didn&#x27;t enhance my hair type in any way.  May be better for other hair types.  I had hoped that it would work on my 6 year old granddaughter as a detangler.  It was a failure on her thick curly hair.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for two years and my local Walmart salon doesn&#x27;t carry it. I love getting it on Amazon Prime, right to my door. I was a bit concerned to see this particular bottle, as it is different than the ones I have used in the past. However, this new spray bottle is WAY better than the old one! I only need a couple of pumps to do the job. I have long wavy hair. I often wear it in a messy bun which encourages snarls. I don&#x27;t brush my hair because it will only get fuzzy and about 2 feet wide. I often ride in my Jeep Wrangler with the top down and we boat on the river and so my hair takes a beating. A few sprays of this product after a shower and WOW I can comb right through it! I will never live without this spray and would recommend it to all who ride cycle, boat and ride in convertibles or just have snarly hair.</li>
            <li> This has drastically improved the feel of my hair which had been dried out from excessive highlighting/coloring.  When I&#x27;d shampoo, my fingers would get stuck in my hair from the gnarly tangles and damage (felt like broomstick hay).  I started using this after every wash, in addition to another leave in spray from Pravana, and my hair really does feel different now.  It is great at undoing tangles and improves hair&#x27;s feel.  I LOVE it.</li>
            <li> I perm my hair to get some life,volume and loose curls.  This product is absolutley amazing!  It allows me to easily comb through my hair while keeping it soft and manageable.  Doesn&#x27;t grease my hair down like some products do.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my daughter&#x27;s hair and although it does help with the tangles, I do not like the way her hair curls afterward. It is less curly and frizzier then when I use other detangling sprays or curl products. I was very disappointed!</li>
            <li> A bit too pricey.  It smells good and does detangle but I find that there are less expensive products out there that does the same thing.</li>
            <li> First of all, I have naturally curly hair and I wear it curly everyday. Even though it&#x27;s a detangler, I noticed that it doesn&#x27;t really detangle unless I already used conditioner. It smells good and does detangle, but I would recommend using only with conditioner.</li>
            <li> I have fine, curly hair that tangles so easily. This detangling spray is awesome, I use after every shower and the tangles come right out with a wide tooth comb. It is light and doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down. I will be ordering another bottle soon!</li>
            <li> its ok, cant find it in stores anymore  but does well for detangles of curly hair. will buy again soon</li>
            <li> I curl my straight hair using a little spray before curling it at night and it keeps my curls done; and they last more tan one day after.  I also like the smell of this spray.</li>
            <li> My 2.5 year old mixed daughter has really curly hair, and myself I don&#x27;t have as much as a wave in my own hair. I&#x27;ve tried dozens of detanglers and conditioners, and it has still been a struggle to get the knots out of my daughter&#x27;s hair. With this product, however, I washed my daughter&#x27;s hair, sprayed it with the detangler, and combed thru her hair with little to no snags.. she didn&#x27;t even complain!!! I am so very happy!!</li>
            <li> I have long, curly hair that tangles very easily. This detangler works great and is worth the price to me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried all the 5-star rated curly hair detanglers I could find on Amazon, and I&#x27;m sticking with this one. I have very fine, very dry, very curly hair that grows very long and tangles if you look at it. If this describes your hair, I would highly recommend trying this product to keep it tame, moisturized, tangle free, and under control. I use it on wet hair right after shampooing to get out any tangles. I leave it in. At night I use it sparingly on dry hair, brush through to moisturize, and get out any tangles that happened during the day. I leave it in, pin up my hair, and in the morning, it&#x27;s wavy, shiny, and tangle free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product does tend to straighten out your hair if you leave it in and pull your hair back or pin it up. If you want curls, I would suggest combing it through wet hair and leaving your hair loose to dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wash my hair once a week with WEN then use Curling Detangler the rest of the week. Before I found this product, I used to wear my hair up all the time or cut it short. Now I&#x27;m letting it grow and wearing it loose every day. I&#x27;m glad to have that option.</li>
            <li> Not like the product I&#x27;m used to buying</li>
            <li> This is a great product. I heard that the Curly Sexy Hair line was being discontinued....I sure hope not because these products work the best on my hair....much better than Paul Mitchell.</li>
