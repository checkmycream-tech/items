            <li>I&#x27;ve wanted something that would help me make a really good easy bun like the one In the picture.</li>
            <li>But  this is the best thing I have come across so far.</li>
            <li>They are sturdy and easy to use, really nicely made and they arrive nicely packaged.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love these.</li>
            <li>It was more money than the one I got at TJ Maxx</li>
            <li>I seriously love this thing.</li>
            <li>Would like to have seen better instructions.</li>
            <li>These are okay...</li>
            <li>I just got it and it doesn&#x27;t even stay on top of your head.</li>
            <li>It was my first time to use this bun maker but it seemed very easy to use!</li>
            <li>It would be nice if detailed instructions were included, along with recommendations for getting snug, smooth results.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>Easy to use product.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so easy to use.</li>
            <li>I have fine layered shoulder length or a bit longer hair</li>
            <li>[[VIDEOID:2692025b7236c0b005104f02c6a68259]]Hey guys, I ordered this bun maker without certainty that it would be perfect for my little girl.</li>
            <li>Also, the bun was secure and held up all day.</li>
            <li>Much easier though than a sock!!!</li>
            <li>My mom has a similar product that is made out of a spongey material and it&#x27;s much more effective.</li>
            <li>I LOVE it making a bun never been so easy I highly recommend this item.</li>
            <li>If you would like to have a beautiful and different hairstyle today, highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Love this product it really works</li>
            <li>Here is my quick review of this bun maker.</li>
            <li>It was fun for my daughters to play with</li>
            <li>I tried it, slips right out when I try to roll it in my hair</li>
            <li>but love this one cuz it&#x27;s easy, fast and simple.</li>
            <li>Works best on a high ponytail vs one that is lower or towards the back of the neck if your hair is long.</li>
            <li>However, upon taking it out of the package and trying it for the first time - the snap detached from the fabric...making this unusable.  </li>
            <li>Exactly as described  in product details.</li>
            <li>The snap broke when I first tried to use it.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;ve tried many different things.</li>
            <li>FAST SHIPPPING !</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li>I will say that in HER hair it works great, and she likes that it has the clasp, but if you have thick hair stay away.</li>
            <li>the only cons about this item is that the metal or rod is very cheap quality didn&#x27;t really hold my hair till I twist the rod.</li>
            <li>The product is covered in some shiny, smooth fabric which makes it look nice, but makes it very hard for hair to stay put.</li>
            <li>Very helpful if you have layers but</li>
            <li>I really like the clip on it.</li>
            <li>I have straight hair and have tried a lot of things to make a bun.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t use them much now.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t work very well.</li>
            <li>The button doesn&#x27;t really work, kept on falling from my hair</li>
            <li>If you have normal thickness of hair, this is the product for you!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, the quality was decent.</li>
            <li>even my 8 years older daughter can&#x27;t used,</li>
            <li>I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li>Works better than the donuts, especially since my hair is 30 inches long.</li>
            <li>These work better than any other similar item I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>It looks great in her long (but thin) hair and when I tried to use it in my thicker hair it didn&#x27;t hold (even with the clasp)  </li>
            <li>Got here fast, but not what I expected, really.</li>
            <li>I would say you need a bit thicker hair than mine to completely cover the bun maker.</li>
            <li>These are really well make and should last a life time.</li>
            <li>Really easy to use except for the snap, I have such a hard time getting it to snap.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t think that is strong enough for my thick hair.</li>
            <li>The first time I got them for my little girl and</li>
            <li>Though it takes a little bit to get used to it, I think that it stays put pretty well during a longer day.</li>
            <li>On top of everything My hair is fine and layered, very bad combination for this product.</li>

            <li> I suggest buying these only if you have long hair.</li>
            <li> I have long hair and it did not work for long hair if you have hair till shoulder Length</li>
            <li> it might work but for long hair it&#x27;s a no</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work for long &amp; thickhair.</li>
            <li> I really wanted these to work: I have thick, wavy hair</li>
            <li> Maybe my hair is too thick, but it just doesn&#x27;t seem to hold it very well.</li>
            <li> After reading some reviews some others said that this product really works with thick hair.</li>
            <li> Good for people who has less hair, but not for me, I have a lot of hair and this is not enough for me :(,</li>
            <li> Works really well, but after using it a few times the little threads ripped.  </li>
            <li> Not sure if it&#x27;s my layers, if my hair is not long enough or if it&#x27;s too slippery...but I can&#x27;t get this to work at all.</li>
            <li> It is a little hard to use at first</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it didn&#x27;t work on my straight Asian hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Definitely gonna try to get my wasted money back</li>
            <li> Not a huge deal because I can sew it back together, but a bummer.  </li>
            <li> It is supposed to work on short hair ( mines like 6 inches past my collarbones ) but</li>
            <li> The only thing that holds them together is one small button</li>
            <li> Even the small piece was to heavy to stay on my head and after an hour it slides down completely.</li>
            <li> Money down the drain for me.</li>
            <li> Not very easy to use. /:</li>
            <li> but) I&#x27;m black and for that&#x27;s now</li>
            <li> It was a waste of money on my part.</li>
            <li> I work in a kitchen and use this everyday to do my hair.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> I recommend this product to anyone who has trouble with making a bun.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> im not sure it works with long thick hair.</li>
            <li> There are other people commenting stating it is hard to use it.</li>
            <li> but I used the small one on my daughter and it kept the bun in place all day.</li>
            <li> The smaller one is a little useless unless you have really thin hair.</li>
            <li> Also, the wire in the product is very stiff and makes it hard to bend and snap ends together.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work for thick hair at all</li>
            <li> Not medium length thick curly hair.</li>
            <li> these didn&#x27;t do well with my thick layered hair.</li>
            <li> I have yet to find a product like this that will work with thick hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> you have thick hair like mine, save your money.</li>
            <li> It was so hard &amp; uncomfortable to use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;ll probably work will for thin hair.</li>
            <li> I have thin hair.</li>
            <li> If you have thin hair, go with a bun maker that&#x27;s made of the foam material.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, my hair is still too thick for this product to work.</li>
            <li> A bit difficult to find the button once you have rolled up your hair and need to close the clip.&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li> but it didn&#x27;t stay in place and was somewhat uncomfortable for them.</li>
            <li> Horrible for long hair!</li>
            <li> Horrible fabric doesn&#x27;t keep rolling to make bun waste of money</li>
            <li> Very difficult to use</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed.</li>
            <li> The clip part is terrible.</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s a great product! Very helpful if you have layers but the only cons about this item is that the metal or rod is very cheap quality didn&#x27;t really hold my hair till I twist the rod.</li>
            <li> Works best on a high ponytail vs one that is lower or towards the back of the neck if your hair is long. Overall - it does work!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it didn&#x27;t work on my straight Asian hair. Even the small piece was to heavy to stay on my head and after an hour it slides down completely. On top of everything My hair is fine and layered, very bad combination for this product. It might work if you have a different type of hair</li>
            <li> I purchased this because it got great reviews.  However, upon taking it out of the package and trying it for the first time - the snap detached from the fabric...making this unusable.  I am very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I really wanted these to work: I have thick, wavy hair and I put it up a lot out of frustration. These appeared to be the miracle solution to putting up hair up without having to use one of those hideous scrunchies, clips, or damaging rubber bands. So, back to the drawing board.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work for thick hair at all</li>
            <li> I really like the clip on it. It held my hair in place. Fits really nice.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described  in product details. Good quality. Easy to use.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it&#x27;s my layers, if my hair is not long enough or if it&#x27;s too slippery...but I can&#x27;t get this to work at all. It was a waste of money on my part. Such is life!</li>
            <li> I returned this. It was so hard &amp; uncomfortable to use. Never again.</li>
            <li> I tried it, slips right out when I try to roll it in my hair</li>
            <li> Easy to use product. A bit difficult to find the button once you have rolled up your hair and need to close the clip.&lt;br /&gt;Good product but too overpriced.</li>
            <li> Got here fast, but not what I expected, really. Maybe my hair is too thick, but it just doesn&#x27;t seem to hold it very well. I gave it to a friend, and she has no problem with it, but she also has thinner hair.</li>
            <li> I suggest buying these only if you have long hair. Not medium length thick curly hair.</li>
            <li> The snap broke when I first tried to use it. It&#x27;ll probably work will for thin hair.</li>
            <li> These work better than any other similar item I&#x27;ve tried. I have fine layered shoulder length or a bit longer hair and they work for me. I only use them around the house as my hair doesn&#x27;t cover the back of the bun. I sleep in them and wake up with beautiful curls the neck day. I have blond hair but doesn&#x27;t matter to me which color I get as I only use them around the house. I would say you need a bit thicker hair than mine to completely cover the bun maker.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve tried many different things. but love this one cuz it&#x27;s easy, fast and simple. and looks great! ))</li>
            <li> I LOVE it making a bun never been so easy I highly recommend this item.</li>
            <li> The snaps broke off, before I had a chance to use it.</li>
            <li> FAST SHIPPPING ! GREAT PRODUCT ! CURLS YOUR HAIR REALLY GOOD OVERNIGHT !</li>
            <li> Do not spend 10$ on this I bought mine for 4 bucks at Walmart ... Save your money and time comes with clips and everything</li>
            <li> Still havent.received it</li>
            <li> These are really well make and should last a life time. Easy to use.</li>

            <li> It was fun for my daughters to play with but it didn&#x27;t stay in place and was somewhat uncomfortable for them. They don&#x27;t use them much now.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these. I had one that I got at TJ Maxx and needed another one after using it a million times it broke. I was so happy to find it on here. It was more money than the one I got at TJ Maxx but it&#x27;s awesome and worth it. It is so easy to use and your bun looks so great. It&#x27;s my go to when I don&#x27;t know what to do with my hair.</li>
            <li> It did not work for me. I have long hair and it did not work for long hair if you have hair till shoulder Length it might work but for long hair it&#x27;s a no</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work for long &amp; thickhair.</li>
            <li> This is the second time I have bought these and they are awesome. The first time I got them for my little girl and this time I got them for myself! They are sturdy and easy to use, really nicely made and they arrive nicely packaged. I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> Horrible for long hair!</li>
            <li> I like this bun maker a lot. Though it takes a little bit to get used to it, I think that it stays put pretty well during a longer day. The smaller one is a little useless unless you have really thin hair.</li>
            <li> This seems to work. No idea if the bun will withstand a days activities yet. It would be nice if detailed instructions were included, along with recommendations for getting snug, smooth results.</li>
            <li> You have to have a lot of hair to cover up the hair piece.</li>
            <li> It does not work like it supposed to. I could not use it at all.</li>
            <li> I wish I could give - stars! It is supposed to work on short hair ( mines like 6 inches past my collarbones ) but&lt;br /&gt;IF YOU HAVE LAYERS DONT BUY THIS PRODUCT&lt;br /&gt;I couldn&#x27;t even get Mt hair to wrap around it.&lt;br /&gt;If it isn&#x27;t supposed to work for mid length hair you should probably clarify that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely gonna try to get my wasted money back</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:2692025b7236c0b005104f02c6a68259]]Hey guys, I ordered this bun maker without certainty that it would be perfect for my little girl. There are other people commenting stating it is hard to use it. Here is my quick review of this bun maker. I hope this was helpful. It was my first time to use this bun maker but it seemed very easy to use! Also, the bun was secure and held up all day. If you would like to have a beautiful and different hairstyle today, highly recommend! Definitely I will buy it again.</li>
            <li> I bought this product after a recommendation from my sister.  It looks great in her long (but thin) hair and when I tried to use it in my thicker hair it didn&#x27;t hold (even with the clasp)  I will say that in HER hair it works great, and she likes that it has the clasp, but if you have thick hair stay away.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work very well. I have thin hair. If you have thin hair, go with a bun maker that&#x27;s made of the foam material.</li>
            <li> I tried several times to use these and they just don&#x27;t work like they are shown. The only thing that holds them together is one small button and I don&#x27;t think that is strong enough for my thick hair. You cannot return them either. Money down the drain for me.</li>
            <li> I seriously love this thing. It&#x27;s so easy to use.</li>
            <li> these didn&#x27;t do well with my thick layered hair. but I used the small one on my daughter and it kept the bun in place all day.</li>
            <li> Very difficult to use and it doesn&#x27;t stay in my hair. im not sure it works with long thick hair.</li>
            <li> My Fav perfect bun hair clip. Works better than the donuts, especially since my hair is 30 inches long. A must buy for longer haired people.</li>
            <li> Enjoyed this a lot!  Her hair looked great.</li>
            <li> Horrible fabric doesn&#x27;t keep rolling to make bun waste of money</li>
            <li> Love this product it really works</li>
            <li> Would like to have seen better instructions.</li>
            <li> The button doesn&#x27;t really work, kept on falling from my hair and even I use the biggest one, still doesn&#x27;t work!</li>
            <li> These are okay... After reading some reviews some others said that this product really works with thick hair. Unfortunately, my hair is still too thick for this product to work. I have yet to find a product like this that will work with thick hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, the quality was decent. I haven&#x27;t tried the smaller one that was included as I know it wouldn&#x27;t even function in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have thick hair like mine, save your money. If you have normal thickness of hair, this is the product for you! It&#x27;s great quality.</li>
            <li> Works great for price</li>
            <li> The product is covered in some shiny, smooth fabric which makes it look nice, but makes it very hard for hair to stay put. My mom has a similar product that is made out of a spongey material and it&#x27;s much more effective. Also, the wire in the product is very stiff and makes it hard to bend and snap ends together.</li>
            <li> great and easy to use!</li>
            <li> Works really well, but after using it a few times the little threads ripped.  Not a huge deal because I can sew it back together, but a bummer.  Much easier though than a sock!!! Would buy it again despite the rip.</li>
            <li> Not very easy to use. /:</li>
            <li> Good for people who has less hair, but not for me, I have a lot of hair and this is not enough for me :(, even my 8 years older daughter can&#x27;t used,</li>
            <li> Waste of money. (No racist but) I&#x27;m black and for that&#x27;s now I&#x27;ve wanted something that would help me make a really good easy bun like the one In the picture. I just got it and it doesn&#x27;t even stay on top of your head. The clip part is terrible. And your hair doesn&#x27;t even wrap around it.</li>
