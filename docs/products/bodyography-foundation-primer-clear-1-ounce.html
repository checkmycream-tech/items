            <li>First thing that impressed me was the size of the bottle.  </li>

            <li>So glad I could find it on Amazom.</li>
            <li>sure what the problem was, I have seen this happen before&lt;</li>
            <li>I just love this stuff and can&#x27;t imagine not using it under my foundation ever again.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li>I love bodyography veil foundation primer.  </li>
            <li>I have to use more because it does not spread evenly</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I would give this a 5 because I love the smoothness the way it goes on, feels on all day, evens out once I put the powder on</li>
            <li>This provides a wonderful feel to your skin applying prior to makeup.  </li>
            <li>Absolutely love this product.  </li>
            <li>There was no straw connected to pump so it wouldn&#x27;t even come out at the top.  </li>
            <li>It is so silky and makes your make-up go on so much better.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m glad I found it on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I love this primer.  </li>
            <li>I just love this primer.</li>
            <li>Seems to work OK.</li>
            <li>My eyeshadow went on much better after using this.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>I have used Bodyography Boost under and over my foundation and was pleased.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve given it to many friends and family and now order in bulk to support all the converts.</li>
            <li>I was so relieved to be able to find it</li>
            <li>AND at such a great price!</li>
            <li>This glossed on easily and the foundation following went on flawlessly.  </li>
            <li>Bodyography is an easy to apply product with its pump dispenser</li>
            <li>This makes your skin silky smooth and makes for easy smooth foundation application.</li>
            <li>foundation goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li>It goes on so smoothly and makes your skin feel like satin.</li>
            <li>When you apply your foundation your face will glow and your skin will look so smooth.</li>
            <li>I love this primer clear the way it gives my skin so smooth and flawless look that last all day.  </li>
            <li>This is such a great product, but I could no longer find it in the stores.  </li>
            <li>My sister gave me a bottle of this product couple years ago to try and I fall in love with it right away.  </li>
            <li>Leaves a nice clean sheen on my skin ready to put on foundation and eyeshadow.  </li>
            <li>So after several uses when its still full it works great.</li>
            <li>and it isn&#x27;t worth the money!</li>
            <li>I followed with my favorite powder and must say, this is the best possible combination possible for me,  </li>
            <li>Worth a try!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s watery and doesn&#x27;t seem to do much at all...does not create a velvety smooth priming layer for sure.</li>
            <li>Words cannot describe my love for this primer; I love everything about it â€“ the way it feels on my skin, how it absorbs quickly, and most importantly, how it makes my foundation go on flawlessly and last ridiculous amounts of time.</li>
            <li>but this is fantastic and allows your make up to glide on so much easier!!</li>
            <li>After I use my Clarisonic Mia to cleanse and follow with toner, moisturizer and this product, it is amazing how soft and tender my face is to receive concealer and foundation.</li>
            <li>I would imagine that it might do that if too much were used, but I don&#x27;t know for sure.</li>
            <li>because I love this product so so much, which is why I&#x27;ve reordered it.</li>
            <li>Once it&#x27;s on, makeup application goes on really smooth and helps to keep makeup fresh all day.</li>
            <li>Not bad for the price.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not bad particularly, but it&#x27;s not my favorite either.</li>
            <li>So I&#x27;m gonna go with the one that feels less oily and is overall better for my skin with its impressive herbal ingredients!</li>
            <li>I just bought 3 more bottles at this same price today, 1 for my mom, 2 for me to keep it in stock to make sure I don&#x27;t run out of this primer.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Yes, the consistency was nice and it did help with my foundation, but I thought that it took too long to set.</li>
            <li>Helps a lot with oily skin, and further more I have sensitive skin and this works on me just fine.</li>
            <li>I have used it for about 3 years, it makes your makeup go on smoothly and makes your skin feel so soft.  </li>
            <li>This is the first time I used a primer</li>
            <li>Not only does this extend the wear time of my foundation, but my skin seems to love the stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>When this is applied, your skin will most definitely feel like there&#x27;s primer hanging out on your face.</li>
            <li>makeup will look better and last longer</li>
            <li>so it keeps the tiny tube filled for quick access.</li>
            <li>This is just as good if not better.  </li>
            <li>The company I sold skin care products for carried a product called &amp;#34;Foundation Silk&amp;#34; and I immediately fell in love with it and could not live without it.  </li>
            <li>Make sure to let it dry, when it is it works really well.</li>
            <li>was leaning towards smashbox primer but really didn&#x27;t appreciated the price.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>Very silky.</li>
            <li>Thanks for carrying the product.</li>
            <li>Nothing to brag about--didn&#x27;t smooth out wrinkles like Sheer Cover does-</li>
            <li>I also didn&#x27;t really notice the difference between which one lasts longer anyways.</li>
            <li>The primer covers each of the areas very well.</li>
            <li>This Bodyography Foundation Primer works very well.  </li>
            <li>ready  </li>
            <li>If this stuff is the real thing, I don&#x27;t care for it at all.</li>
            <li>This by far is as good if not better for a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li>Bodyography&#x27;s primer has that certain silky consistency that I love in a primer and sets a great base for my foundation.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Needless to say, I quickly found my way back</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>The smooth feeling that it brings to your skin really helps any other product just glide on</li>
            <li>Item was exactly as described, not an imitation product, is true the Bodyography brand.</li>
            <li>I am new to the Bodyography line and read the reviews of both the radiance boost and primer</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>It is okay, not like what I have used in the past.</li>
            <li>There is such a difference in the look of my foundation when I don&#x27;t apply this first.</li>
            <li>Even though it&#x27;s only an ounce it lasts a long time and makes your skin feel so so smooth.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the Bodyography clear primer for almost 2 years now.</li>
            <li>I have recommended this product to several of my friends who have also been very please with this product.  </li>
            <li>I use Estee Lauder cream makeup in a tube and the primer makes one tube of that last so much longer than without it.</li>
            <li>It leaves your skin feeling so soft and</li>
            <li>Was surprised to find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li>It goes on so smoth and doesn&#x27;t cause problems with my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>the skin soft  </li>
            <li>I was surprised at the consistency when I squirted it out.  </li>
            <li>I am in my early sixities and do not have problem skin,</li>
            <li>I am a professional cosmetologist, so I have access to alot of products.</li>
            <li>Personally, I think I look the exact same with or without it.</li>
            <li>That was a huge detriment to the overall experience with the product because I have to store it upside down</li>
            <li>I found this on Amazon and it feels just the same as the high dollar brand but at a fraction of the cost.</li>
            <li>After applying moisturizer and before applying makeup just two small squirts is all it takes to make my skin smooth.  </li>
            <li>My face couldn&#x27;t possibly get any clearer and you can barely tell that I have any make-up</li>

            <li> I also didn&#x27;t really notice the difference between which one lasts longer anyways.</li>
            <li> The primer covers each of the areas very well.</li>
            <li> This Bodyography Foundation Primer works very well.  </li>
            <li> ready  </li>
            <li> If this stuff is the real thing, I don&#x27;t care for it at all.</li>
            <li> This by far is as good if not better for a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li> Bodyography&#x27;s primer has that certain silky consistency that I love in a primer and sets a great base for my foundation.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Needless to say, I quickly found my way back</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> The smooth feeling that it brings to your skin really helps any other product just glide on</li>
            <li> Item was exactly as described, not an imitation product, is true the Bodyography brand.</li>
            <li> I am new to the Bodyography line and read the reviews of both the radiance boost and primer</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> It is okay, not like what I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> There is such a difference in the look of my foundation when I don&#x27;t apply this first.</li>
            <li> Even though it&#x27;s only an ounce it lasts a long time and makes your skin feel so so smooth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Bodyography clear primer for almost 2 years now.</li>
            <li> I have recommended this product to several of my friends who have also been very please with this product.  </li>
            <li> I use Estee Lauder cream makeup in a tube and the primer makes one tube of that last so much longer than without it.</li>
            <li> It leaves your skin feeling so soft and</li>
            <li> Was surprised to find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> It goes on so smoth and doesn&#x27;t cause problems with my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> the skin soft  </li>
            <li> I was surprised at the consistency when I squirted it out.  </li>
            <li> I am in my early sixities and do not have problem skin,</li>
            <li> I am a professional cosmetologist, so I have access to alot of products.</li>
            <li> Personally, I think I look the exact same with or without it.</li>
            <li> That was a huge detriment to the overall experience with the product because I have to store it upside down</li>
            <li> I found this on Amazon and it feels just the same as the high dollar brand but at a fraction of the cost.</li>
            <li> After applying moisturizer and before applying makeup just two small squirts is all it takes to make my skin smooth.  </li>
            <li> My face couldn&#x27;t possibly get any clearer and you can barely tell that I have any make-up</li>
            <li> Perhaps the other users of this product do not have sensitive, break-out prone skin.</li>
            <li> Moderately oily in some areas, extra dry around the nose and under the eyes, with the occasional hormonal breakout.</li>
            <li> When I ran out of the sample and tried some other primers, I noticed that my skin seemed to be steadily growing a bit rough around the edges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Whether it&#x27;s real or a knock-off, don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> having trouble getting out with the new packaging sprayer</li>
            <li> /&gt;People commented on how smooth my skin looked while I was using it, and I had one of those weird moments where you look in the mirror and notice a big change in your appearance.</li>
            <li> other than my skin is a little dryer as I get older and in winter.</li>
            <li> I like this primer and am continuing to use it, however, the pump broke not too long after I received it.  </li>
            <li> One of the minor downsides to it would have to be the smell.</li>
            <li> Very velvety and thick.</li>
            <li> and I found it on Amazon for less than $15.00 dollars each, I immediately bought 2 bottles last August, it does last a very long time</li>
            <li> Keeps your face dry.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t let it dry</li>
            <li> it will look odd mixed with make judo</li>
            <li> Not only does it help the foundation stay on longer, but it also requires you to use less foundation.</li>
            <li> When our company closed its doors, I knew I had to find a product just like it.  </li>
            <li> I started searching online when my bottle got almost empty</li>
            <li> No real complaints about this transaction</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way</li>
            <li> A little does go a long way, by the way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> once I have very little left.</li>
            <li> In the past I have purchased other similar products but they do not compare to Bodyography.</li>
            <li> Never tried the other varieties that it comes in -</li>
            <li> Only a small amount is needed.  </li>
            <li> I saw this in other reviews too</li>
            <li> Produces a very smooth base for foundation.  </li>
            <li> It flakes big time, I learned that the hard way.</li>
            <li> I just have to get the product out of the bottle by turning upside down &amp; tapping it onto my fingers.  </li>
            <li> As it lowers, I just now have to store it upside down</li>
            <li> Not true.  </li>
            <li> some others, I found this primer did not mix well with foundation, and was coming off in little pieces on the  applicator sponge</li>
            <li> It makes it a little tougher to keep both my mom and myself in stock.</li>
            <li> but don&#x27;t want to waste the product.  </li>
            <li> so it was a waste of money...</li>
            <li> Not easy to find in my area.  </li>
            <li> Used to buy in a local store, but found it significantly less expensive on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> I put very little on now to avoid the flaking off.</li>
            <li> Takes very little to cover and silky feel.  </li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not sure why they have not done something about it.</li>
            <li> put a small amount, about 1/4 inch on my fingers, rub it together with my fingers then blot all over my face.  </li>
            <li> Thought I would try this product since it is cheaper than what I usually buy.</li>
            <li> and when I went back to buy some it was outrageously expensive.</li>
            <li> Used in appearance, hardly, anything in bottle.</li>
            <li> Just sitting there, slowly setting.</li>
            <li> This will seriously transform how you feel about your foundation and how your skin looks.</li>
            <li> For me, I think this primer works as well as Arbonne and DHC primers and much less expensive.</li>
            <li> Sad</li>
            <li> It is very thin and slimy.  </li>
            <li> was disappointed when I went to reorder this makeup, as the response said could not ship to my location,but it has been shipped previously, :(</li>
            <li> Otherwise it&#x27;ll drive you mad having to wait for it when you&#x27;re in a hurry.</li>
            <li> The smell is very unpleasant.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Love the product. having trouble getting out with the new packaging sprayer</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s a great yet affordable product.&lt;br /&gt;I was leaning towards smashbox primer but really didn&#x27;t appreciated the price.&lt;br /&gt;This primer is feel similar.&lt;br /&gt;I been wearing it underneath my makeup foundation and compering it to another brands - this one didn&#x27;t cause me to brake out.</li>
            <li> Love this face primer, feels like silk on your face.</li>
            <li> arrived in a damaged box and no seal or invoice. Used in appearance, hardly, anything in bottle. Sad</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for over a year now and absolutely love it. In the past I have purchased other similar products but they do not compare to Bodyography. I have recommended this product to several of my friends who have also been very please with this product.  Renee  Texas</li>
            <li> Very velvety and thick. Keeps your face dry. Love the feeling when it&#x27;s put on. Very silky.</li>
            <li> I love this primer!! Never tried the other varieties that it comes in - but this is fantastic and allows your make up to glide on so much easier!! Makes my skin feel like silk!!</li>
            <li> One must try this product to see how wonderful it is.  Not easy to find in my area.  So glad I could find it on Amazom.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product, could not make your application of foundation any eaiser, your make-up glides on and it evens everything out.  Will continue to purchase and always have on hand.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews and it seemed like a good deal.&lt;br /&gt;I am forever in search of the perfect primer.&lt;br /&gt;Like some others, I found this primer did not mix well with foundation, and was coming off in little pieces on the  applicator sponge&lt;br /&gt;not sure what the problem was, I have seen this happen before&lt;br /&gt;back to the drawing board&lt;br /&gt;No problem with the seller&lt;br /&gt;Was packaged well and arrived in a timely manner</li>
            <li> This makes your skin silky smooth and makes for easy smooth foundation application. I love it! It also seems as though the product never runs out.</li>
            <li> My suppliers  quit handling  this product. Happy to be  able to get  it  again</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Bodyography clear primer for almost 2 years now. Each time I purchase, I get 2...one for my mom and one for myself. A little goes a long way and I&#x27;ve never seen the stuff peel off or flake. I would imagine that it might do that if too much were used, but I don&#x27;t know for sure. I just love this stuff and can&#x27;t imagine not using it under my foundation ever again. I use Estee Lauder cream makeup in a tube and the primer makes one tube of that last so much longer than without it. My makeup just glides on over the primer. Recently though, I have noticed that the price has gone up and the size of the bottle has shrunk. It makes it a little tougher to keep both my mom and myself in stock.</li>
            <li> Make sure to let it dry, when it is it works really well. If you don&#x27;t let it dry it will look odd mixed with make judo</li>
            <li> Once you start to use this product, you will never want to be without it!  Only a small amount is needed.  It leaves your skin feeling so soft and foundation goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product. I order 2 at a time so I will NEVER run out. Thanks for carrying the product.</li>
            <li> I love bodyography veil foundation primer.  I have used it for about 3 years, it makes your makeup go on smoothly and makes your skin feel so soft.  I think it is wonderful.  I will continue using it. Was surprised to find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I like this primer and am continuing to use it, however, the pump broke not too long after I received it.  I just have to get the product out of the bottle by turning upside down &amp; tapping it onto my fingers.  A pain but don&#x27;t want to waste the product.  Would have returned if it would have happened within 30 days.</li>
            <li> Great for under your makeup evens  skin tone and makes a smooth finish to your face not greasy leaves a powder finish</li>
            <li> It is okay, not like what I have used in the past. I have to use more because it does not spread evenly</li>
            <li> Nothing to brag about--didn&#x27;t smooth out wrinkles like Sheer Cover does-</li>
            <li> I love this product. It goes on so smoothly and makes your skin feel like satin. When you apply your foundation your face will glow and your skin will look so smooth. There is such a difference in the look of my foundation when I don&#x27;t apply this first.</li>
            <li> The company I sold skin care products for carried a product called &amp;#34;Foundation Silk&amp;#34; and I immediately fell in love with it and could not live without it.  When our company closed its doors, I knew I had to find a product just like it.  The &amp;#34;Bodyography Foundation Primer&amp;#34; was just what I was looking for.  I&#x27;m loving it! :)</li>
            <li> This is the first time I used a primer so I can&#x27;t compare several brands for you. Personally, I think I look the exact same with or without it. I bought it because that&#x27;s what the makeup experts say to do. It flakes big time, I learned that the hard way. I put very little on now to avoid the flaking off.</li>
            <li> Words cannot describe my love for this primer; I love everything about it â€“ the way it feels on my skin, how it absorbs quickly, and most importantly, how it makes my foundation go on flawlessly and last ridiculous amounts of time. This will seriously transform how you feel about your foundation and how your skin looks. One of the minor downsides to it would have to be the smell. It&#x27;s not bad particularly, but it&#x27;s not my favorite either. It&#x27;s bearable nonetheless! Another thing is that it arrived without the tube that goes on the inside and connects with the pump. That was a huge detriment to the overall experience with the product because I have to store it upside down and I don&#x27;t know how it&#x27;s going to dispense the product once I have very little left. I didn&#x27;t have the heart to give it four stars, however, because I love this product so so much, which is why I&#x27;ve reordered it. If you&#x27;re on the fence about buying this product, fathom no longer: this will change your life.</li>
            <li> My sister gave me a bottle of this product couple years ago to try and I fall in love with it right away.  I started searching online when my bottle got almost empty and I found it on Amazon for less than $15.00 dollars each, I immediately bought 2 bottles last August, it does last a very long time and I use it daily ever since my sister got me hook on this primer I can&#x27;t imagine going out a day without it. I love this primer clear the way it gives my skin so smooth and flawless look that last all day.  I just bought 3 more bottles at this same price today, 1 for my mom, 2 for me to keep it in stock to make sure I don&#x27;t run out of this primer.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> I would give this a 5 because I love the smoothness the way it goes on, feels on all day, evens out once I put the powder on but the flaw is theres no straw inside for the pump! I saw this in other reviews too so I&#x27;m not sure why they have not done something about it. So after several uses when its still full it works great. As it lowers, I just now have to store it upside down so it keeps the tiny tube filled for quick access. Otherwise it&#x27;ll drive you mad having to wait for it when you&#x27;re in a hurry. I do hope they fix this issue before I need to buy my next bottle!</li>
            <li> Item was exactly as described, not an imitation product, is true the Bodyography brand. No real complaints about this transaction</li>
            <li> This provides a wonderful feel to your skin applying prior to makeup.  Once it&#x27;s on, makeup application goes on really smooth and helps to keep makeup fresh all day.</li>
            <li> Love this primer!  I have very sensitive skin and this causes no irritation. Not only does it help the foundation stay on longer, but it also requires you to use less foundation.</li>
            <li> Feels too greasy. I prefer Palladio, because it has that silky feel on your fingers like those pricey primers do! I also didn&#x27;t really notice the difference between which one lasts longer anyways. So I&#x27;m gonna go with the one that feels less oily and is overall better for my skin with its impressive herbal ingredients!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this product.  I have a group of friends that I travel with - we all prefer this primer to any we have ever used.  Would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This stuff SUCKED!  There was no straw connected to pump so it wouldn&#x27;t even come out at the top.  You have to open it up and shake the primer onto your hand.  Also it look as if what I got had already been used.  I tried it and it didn&#x27;t hold my makeup at all and it isn&#x27;t worth the money!</li>
            <li> My mother and I have used this product for years! It works great over moisturizer, fills large pores and fine lines to ensure that foundation looks smooth and skin looks flawless!</li>
            <li> Using about 12 years.  A wonderful product!</li>
            <li> I have been using this for awhile now and I must say it&#x27;s the best primer I have ever used. It is so silky and makes your make-up go on so much better. The store I get it from is no longer carrying it so I&#x27;m glad I found it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> This is the best primer i have ever used.I have tried a couple of others from QVC and this has always been ths best.</li>
            <li> I love this primer.  It goes on so smoth and doesn&#x27;t cause problems with my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I just love this primer. I also bought at the same time another primer by Chanel for $70. This by far is as good if not better for a fraction of the price. I put it on every day prior to putting on my foundation. I let it set on my face for about 2 minutes before applying my foundation. My skin feels like a piece of the finest silk. My foundation stays put all day, something that never happens if I don&#x27;t use the primer. I would estimate that this bottle will last me about 6 months with applying every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put a small amount, about 1/4 inch on my fingers, rub it together with my fingers then blot all over my face.  I do not rub this in but simply blot.</li>
            <li> This is junk...I loved the product itself...But after about a week the dispenser cap doesn&#x27;t work...so it was a waste of money...</li>
            <li> This primer does good things for my makeup and my skin. Bodyography&#x27;s primer has that certain silky consistency that I love in a primer and sets a great base for my foundation. Not only does this extend the wear time of my foundation, but my skin seems to love the stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I initially tried the primer through a monthly subscription box. Taking the price into consideration, I wasn&#x27;t all that impressed at first. Yes, the consistency was nice and it did help with my foundation, but I thought that it took too long to set. When this is applied, your skin will most definitely feel like there&#x27;s primer hanging out on your face. Just sitting there, slowly setting. When it sets, it&#x27;s glorious. However, it&#x27;s the one thing that I still don&#x27;t like about this product. Thankfully, I ended up just summoning up an ounce of patience and used the (generous) sample in its entirety over the course of a month or so. A little does go a long way, by the way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;People commented on how smooth my skin looked while I was using it, and I had one of those weird moments where you look in the mirror and notice a big change in your appearance. When I ran out of the sample and tried some other primers, I noticed that my skin seemed to be steadily growing a bit rough around the edges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Needless to say, I quickly found my way back and I&#x27;m currently on my second bottle. I will be repurchasing again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Extra Information:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have combination skin. Moderately oily in some areas, extra dry around the nose and under the eyes, with the occasional hormonal breakout. The primer covers each of the areas very well.</li>
            <li> It goes on well, very smooth. Seems to work OK. The smell is very unpleasant. Smells like liquefied kitty litter.</li>
            <li> Bodyography is an easy to apply product with its pump dispenser The smooth feeling that it brings to your skin really helps any other product just glide on</li>
            <li> Thought I would try this product since it is cheaper than what I usually buy. Perhaps the other users of this product do not have sensitive, break-out prone skin. I do, and my skin instantly broke out all over. Also the product flakes off of the skin when I try to apply my foundation over -- even when I wait several minutes for the primer to set. Everyone is different -- this product does not work well for me personally.</li>
            <li> This Bodyography Foundation Primer works very well.  Leaves a nice clean sheen on my skin ready to put on foundation and eyeshadow.  My eyeshadow went on much better after using this.</li>
            <li> Works wonders and smells good.</li>
            <li> To be used  BEFORE  the moisturizer.  Leaves  the skin soft  ready  for  the next face cream and make up. I love it.</li>
            <li> I got a sample of foundation primer in a gift bag and when I went back to buy some it was outrageously expensive. I found this on Amazon and it feels just the same as the high dollar brand but at a fraction of the cost. Even though it&#x27;s only an ounce it lasts a long time and makes your skin feel so so smooth.</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for. If this stuff is the real thing, I don&#x27;t care for it at all. It&#x27;s watery and doesn&#x27;t seem to do much at all...does not create a velvety smooth priming layer for sure. Whether it&#x27;s real or a knock-off, don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> Very happy indeed. Helps a lot with oily skin, and further more I have sensitive skin and this works on me just fine. No itchiness, no irritation. Very kind to skin, and I find that my skin is a bit clearer because the primer helps with the oiliness.</li>
            <li> I received this yesterday and tried it this morning.  First thing that impressed me was the size of the bottle.  Not bad for the price.  I was surprised at the consistency when I squirted it out.  It is very thin and slimy.  I was used to a thicker primer thinking you needed a plaster to primer for good foundation coverage.  Not true.  This glossed on easily and the foundation following went on flawlessly.  I followed with my favorite powder and must say, this is the best possible combination possible for me,  My face couldn&#x27;t possibly get any clearer and you can barely tell that I have any make-up on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried a Sephora brand for which I paid $68.00.  This is just as good if not better.  BTW, I am 50.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  I just received my second bottle.  The pump does not work and I cannot get any of the primer out of the bottle.  It comes out in spits and I have to pump it 50 times to get enough.  I won&#x27;t be ordering this again.</li>
            <li> This works as described.  Prepares the skin for the foundation and it does go on smoother.  Would buy again.,</li>
            <li> Love it.  Takes very little to cover and silky feel.  Produces a very smooth base for foundation.  Lessens wrinkles and hides pores.</li>
            <li> Great primer - goes on silky, doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;roll&amp;#34; off.</li>
            <li> I have used Bodyography Boost under and over my foundation and was pleased.  I am new to the Bodyography line and read the reviews of both the radiance boost and primer (Radiance Boost is what I was initially looking for) and read on and found Primer product! For me, I think this primer works as well as Arbonne and DHC primers and much less expensive. I put it over my moisturizer, or wear it as a moisturizer. Amazing smoothness to receive flawless foundation. I do mix brands and found that Bodyography received my Merle Norman liquid foundation great. I am in my early sixities and do not have problem skin, other than my skin is a little dryer as I get older and in winter. After I use my Clarisonic Mia to cleanse and follow with toner, moisturizer and this product, it is amazing how soft and tender my face is to receive concealer and foundation. I have not had any skin reaction to product. Economically priced and for me, a great product. I will reorder!</li>
            <li> This is the best and the silkiest primer I have ever used. I am a professional cosmetologist, so I have access to alot of products. I used to retail it in my salon until my suppliers could no longer get it. Glad I found it through Amazon!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for several years now and swear by it.  After applying moisturizer and before applying makeup just two small squirts is all it takes to make my skin smooth.  It works well with the mineral makeup that I use and helps my makeup last longer.  It creates a perfect smooth canvas for applying makeup.  I&#x27;ve given it to many friends and family and now order in bulk to support all the converts. Used to buy in a local store, but found it significantly less expensive on Amazon.  Worth a try!</li>
            <li> Use this before your foundation .your makeup will look better and last longer&lt;br /&gt;I was disappointed when I went to reorder this makeup, as the response said could not ship to my location,but it has been shipped previously, :(</li>
            <li> This is such a great product, but I could no longer find it in the stores.  I was so relieved to be able to find it AND at such a great price!</li>
            <li> Been using for a couple years - it smooths the skin for foundation.</li>
