            <li>This is a nice oil skin ointment.  </li>
            <li>the ointment is also great for ingrown hairs anywhere on the body, and makes my armpits silky soft and beautiful looking after i shave hehe</li>
            <li>The smell is also very strong.</li>
            <li>very easy way to apply to cut&#x27;s and etc</li>
            <li>I love tea tree oil, and now I love this ointment!  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff, I have been using it for months now</li>
            <li>&#x3D;)</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>I thought it would be more like a lotion, or maybe like an antibiotic cream consistency.</li>
            <li>I have tried many things to control the itching.  </li>
            <li>I only have been using this product for a couple days now and my skin feels wonderful!</li>
            <li>my best girlfriend popped a pimple above her lip, i let her borrow this for two or three days and told her to rub it on twice a day,</li>
            <li>when i wash my face before bed i put a coating on and my skin has never been better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pleased with that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>good, but the pure oil still better.</li>
            <li>This product is great for anyone looking to calm down razor burn of the thighs, smooth and happy legs!</li>
            <li>I use many Desert Essence products and I tried to use the Desert Essence Day Cream but something about it made my face react strongly against it and had to wash it off.</li>
            <li>if you arent familiar with tea tree the scent can be a bit overwhelming but the jojoba oil and lavender helps minimize it.</li>
            <li>Amazon easily refunded my money afterwards, though.</li>
            <li>For face, cuts, irritations, it&#x27;s perfectly fine.</li>
            <li>So, if this is your first time buying please make sure to test it first!</li>
            <li>Dessert Essence skin care is my absolute favorite.  </li>
            <li>It does have a strong tea tree oil smell when you first put it on</li>
            <li>Reminds me of menthol, but not as powerful.</li>
            <li>Love this product, use it almost daily.</li>
            <li>Is exactly what it says.</li>
            <li>I use this as my &#x27;go to&#x27; for pretty much everything, scrapes, itchy skin, even hangnails.  </li>
            <li>Also does not have a very strong fragrance, compared to other Tea Tree oil products I have used.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t help with acne, scarring, skin roughness, deodorizing or really anything I could take note of.</li>
            <li>if i blow my nose too much</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not unpleasant to me, but it&#x27;s definitely an ointment smell, which is why I just wear it to bed.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Highly Recommended</li>
            <li>The other reviews sound promising</li>
            <li>No negative effects, but nothing helpful either.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t see any new benefits to my skin.</li>
            <li>However, I just wanted to review it so far as I think it&#x27;s important for customers to know this is not really the consistency I would imagine an \\&quot;ointment\\&quot; to be.</li>
            <li>Again, this is just an initial review, and it&#x27;s not a HUGE problem, I was just hoping for something more like a lotion to spread easily on large areas of the body.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s brought such relief and healing in just the first week.</li>
            <li>You really don&#x27;t want to put too much on during the day because it is not absorbed easily or as fast and it leaves your face looking shiny</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more like a hard balm.</li>
            <li>i nanny and yesterday morning the three year old</li>
            <li>This is perfectly fine for small patches.</li>
            <li>after doing a little research i started putting it on my lips, it healed cracks in the corners of my mouth completely in less than 36 hours, and had them feeling silky smooth the whole time.</li>
            <li>but I strongly suggest doing a small skin test before putting it on a larger area.</li>
            <li>My skin is very sensitive and I can&#x27;t use anything that is not completely natural.  </li>
            <li>i love this stuff and after using half of my first jar i think ill be a customer for life.</li>

            <li> You can only get so much on your fingers unless you carve a chunk out, and then it&#x27;s hard to spread.  </li>
            <li> especially if you have dry skin.</li>
            <li> I was a little cautious at first because it looked a little greasy</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m hoping it will help with dry skin patches and acne.</li>
            <li> bought the two pack, so I believe I&#x27;m well stocked for now, but despite my misgivings with spending so much on such small containers, I would buy this again if necessary.</li>
            <li> Also great for lips- especially badly chapped, cracked or blistered ones!</li>
            <li> I have a rash of unknown origin (idiopathic uticaria).  </li>
            <li> but a little goes a long way with this item.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> When used after waxing or epilating I use a very small amount, just enough for one pass on the treated area</li>
            <li> , ice helped lower the swelling about half way</li>
            <li> She has gone from a mess of itchy twitchy fur to a tea-tree scented wonder.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I need something a little thicker than oil</li>
            <li> A few days of applying to my winter cracked heels and hands</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s a small container</li>
            <li> but i rubbed this on his boo boo about three times a day for the past two days and the bump is hardly noticeable.</li>
            <li> Dries you out and stinks horribly *plus the smell is very strong.</li>
            <li> Works, doesn&#x27;t smell too bad and will wait see the long term moisturizing effects.</li>
            <li> My husbands feet have terrible sores.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> A friend recommended tea tree oil to me for my itchy dog&#x27;s itchy skin. I tried this stuff and while she&#x27;s not fond of the scent, she is fond of the results. She has gone from a mess of itchy twitchy fur to a tea-tree scented wonder.</li>
            <li> Have used Desert Essence products for 30+ yrs.  Excellent quality &amp; price.  I use this as my &#x27;go to&#x27; for pretty much everything, scrapes, itchy skin, even hangnails.  Have even used it on our toy rat terrier, who has a dermatitis issue on his rump.  Works excellent for both me &amp; him.  Will order again, unless I can find this 2-pck cheaper elsewhere.</li>
            <li> Love this product, use it almost daily.</li>
            <li> I did not keep this product but did return it.  I use capsules as opposed to ointments</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, I have been using it for months now and it&#x27;s great for after waxing or epilating. It does have a strong tea tree oil smell when you first put it on but it fades away soon after. And it&#x27;s a small container but a little goes a long way with this item. You really don&#x27;t want to put too much on during the day because it is not absorbed easily or as fast and it leaves your face looking shiny (i use it instead of moisturizer twice a week on my face before going to bed). When used after waxing or epilating I use a very small amount, just enough for one pass on the treated area and i then wait for it to absorb (about a minute or so) before putting on my sunscreen or lotion. It really is a good product but I strongly suggest doing a small skin test before putting it on a larger area. I use many Desert Essence products and I tried to use the Desert Essence Day Cream but something about it made my face react strongly against it and had to wash it off. I ended up giving it to my sister who had no problems. So, if this is your first time buying please make sure to test it first! Good luck &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> This is a nice oil skin ointment.  My husband likes it too and I would recommend it to anyone.  It has a pleasant name too.  :)</li>
            <li> Dessert Essence skin care is my absolute favorite.  Will not use anything else on my face.  Helps with my oily skin.</li>
            <li> My husbands feet have terrible sores. We&#x27;ve tried everything. I bought two of the tea tree ointments. It&#x27;s brought such relief and healing in just the first week. He said to order it again before it runs out.</li>
            <li> Very happy with the product!</li>
            <li> I love tea tree oil, and now I love this ointment!  Sometimes I need something a little thicker than oil and this does the trick!</li>
            <li> Excellent product will be buying more</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had this product long enough to write a review of its effects on the skin. The other reviews sound promising and I&#x27;m hoping it will help with dry skin patches and acne. However, I just wanted to review it so far as I think it&#x27;s important for customers to know this is not really the consistency I would imagine an \\&quot;ointment\\&quot; to be. I thought it would be more like a lotion, or maybe like an antibiotic cream consistency. It&#x27;s more like a hard balm. You don&#x27;t take it out of the container, you can only rub your fingers on it and then rub your fingers on your skin. This is perfectly fine for small patches. I, however, purchased this to cover my back with and it takes several minutes, several positions, and what feels like a million rubs of the solid balm. You can only get so much on your fingers unless you carve a chunk out, and then it&#x27;s hard to spread.  The smell is also very strong. I find it pleasant, but for those who are on the fence, know it&#x27;s quite fragrant.&lt;br /&gt;  Again, this is just an initial review, and it&#x27;s not a HUGE problem, I was just hoping for something more like a lotion to spread easily on large areas of the body. For face, cuts, irritations, it&#x27;s perfectly fine. I will update if I find the product does or does not help my skin.&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: Used two of these until finished. I don&#x27;t see any new benefits to my skin. It didn&#x27;t help with acne, scarring, skin roughness, deodorizing or really anything I could take note of.No negative effects, but nothing helpful either.</li>
            <li> I have a rash of unknown origin (idiopathic uticaria).  I have tried many things to control the itching.  Recently, nothing I had been trying worked.  I searched Tea Tree oil products on Amazon and found this.  I thought I was in heaven when this arrived.  The itching quit immediately and stayed away.  Now after two months, I have to apply it 2 or 3 times a day to control the itching, but this product continues to work well.</li>
            <li> good, but the pure oil still better.</li>
            <li> Works, doesn&#x27;t smell too bad and will wait see the long term moisturizing effects.</li>
            <li> Great transaction ... Highly Recommended</li>
            <li> Great substitute for a Neosporin</li>
            <li> very easy way to apply to cut&#x27;s and etc</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, great for all skin types.</li>
            <li> Is exactly what it says. Also does not have a very strong fragrance, compared to other Tea Tree oil products I have used.</li>
            <li> Dries you out and stinks horribly *plus the smell is very strong. Amazon easily refunded my money afterwards, though.</li>
            <li> This stuff has worked great for me in clearing up fungal infections. Also great for lips- especially badly chapped, cracked or blistered ones!</li>
            <li> This product is great for anyone looking to calm down razor burn of the thighs, smooth and happy legs!</li>
            <li> I have been using this for years.  My skin is very sensitive and I can&#x27;t use anything that is not completely natural.  The perfect thing for my skin.</li>
            <li> good stuff works great</li>
            <li> I only have been using this product for a couple days now and my skin feels wonderful! I was a little cautious at first because it looked a little greasy but it feels great and my face just soaks it up. My face is loving it!</li>
            <li> i nanny and yesterday morning the three year old i watch got a bump on his forehead the size of my thumb, ice helped lower the swelling about half way but i rubbed this on his boo boo about three times a day for the past two days and the bump is hardly noticeable. my best girlfriend popped a pimple above her lip, i let her borrow this for two or three days and told her to rub it on twice a day, when i started having ointment withdrawls three days later there wasnt even a red mark above her lip where the open pimple had been. when i wash my face before bed i put a coating on and my skin has never been better. after doing a little research i started putting it on my lips, it healed cracks in the corners of my mouth completely in less than 36 hours, and had them feeling silky smooth the whole time. if you arent familiar with tea tree the scent can be a bit overwhelming but the jojoba oil and lavender helps minimize it. it works just like vicks vapor rub too. if i blow my nose too much i put it on the inside of my nostrils. i love this stuff and after using half of my first jar i think ill be a customer for life. id recommend getting the 2oz jar because it is a bit misleading in its size. the ointment is also great for ingrown hairs anywhere on the body, and makes my armpits silky soft and beautiful looking after i shave hehe</li>
            <li> Great product at an amazing price. A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> this stuff is a really good moisturizer. especially if you have dry skin.</li>
            <li> I had the feeling that it would work for me, otherwise I wouldn&#x27;t have taken the chance with the price as it is, but was not expecting how well it worked. A few days of applying to my winter cracked heels and hands and they&#x27;re already smoothing out, so I&#x27;m pleased with that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know what I thought that it would smell like. Lavender oil was listed as an ingredient so I was imagining something similar to my incense or air fresheners, but the scent is actually like a weaker Vick&#x27;s scent. Reminds me of menthol, but not as powerful. It&#x27;s not unpleasant to me, but it&#x27;s definitely an ointment smell, which is why I just wear it to bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought the two pack, so I believe I&#x27;m well stocked for now, but despite my misgivings with spending so much on such small containers, I would buy this again if necessary.</li>
