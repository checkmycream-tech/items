            <li>, I am making sure that I follow the suggested usage, I believe that is real important.</li>
            <li>, I guess when they said get on the truck to receive your breasts I kind of missed it.....:)</li>
            <li>Wow, so impressed with Naturaful.....</li>
            <li>having now go get surgery done to make me feel better.</li>
            <li>Naturaful has provided excellent customer service and I would definitely recommend them based on it.</li>
            <li>They look more rounded.</li>
            <li>realise this review isn&#x27;t the most helpful at the moment</li>
            <li>Hopefully I will see more gain going forward</li>
            <li>The customer service team seems to really follow up with you once you reach out to them to make sure you are happy.</li>
            <li>I will try to post a follow up once I have used it more.</li>
            <li>Oh well, guess I just got to love with what I got.</li>
            <li>As many of you may be, I was somewhat hesitant about the ability of a cream to enhance one&#x27;s breast size.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s okay with me.  </li>
            <li>I also made sure to get under the breast and up towards your collar bone.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m more than content with this product.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m just overall really happy with the product!</li>
            <li>If you do buy this product MAKE SURE</li>
            <li>I contacted the company NATURAFUL directly and they made sure I was satisfied and offered great tips and help.</li>
            <li>Safe and easy cream to use once or twice a day.</li>
            <li>Happy results so far!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m also really happy because it&#x27;s all natural</li>
            <li>but hopefully it would work it could easily but</li>
            <li>and they were very quick to answer and send it to me.</li>
            <li>I used it mainly for estrogen factor and loved the smell.</li>
            <li>Also some nights once after I have applied the cream I use a warm hot pack to help blood flow to my breast n massage them twice a week.</li>
            <li>It has not made a huge difference.  </li>
            <li>The formula is also not parabin free.</li>
            <li>, I also find Naturaful a company genuinely cares about its customers.&lt;br</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s not like a chemical substance that lifts your bust and then stops, it actually works with your body naturally safe and effectively :)</li>
            <li>and they are so light</li>
            <li>But .... so far, so slowly good.</li>
            <li>worth your time or money, but it is a very good lotion if you don&#x27;t want dry skin, but that&#x27;s not what I purchased it for...</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with the results so far and will continue to use this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll update after my full nine months is up.</li>
            <li>months, I have gained a full cup size.</li>
            <li>, I am just asking for a full B cup..</li>
            <li>I can definitely say it&#x27;s a lot better than many other companies I&#x27;ve experienced on the internet.</li>
            <li>The size has increased slightly, but I&#x27;m happy I don&#x27;t have to look at a couple of prunes every morning.</li>
            <li>Ive used this 5 jars worth</li>
            <li>After breast feeding and breast pumping for a full year for each of 2 kids my breasts had definitely seen better days.</li>
            <li>Only after that time period ends will I be able to make a full assessment.  </li>
            <li>They are saying results takes more than 3 to 6 months, then how would one know if their return policy is only for two months.</li>
            <li>should have gotten implants in the first place..</li>
            <li>It was an absolute pleasure to do business with the people of Naturaful!</li>
            <li>It is still too soon to judge, but in my opinion (I underline &amp;#34;in my opinion&amp;#34;) it is working.</li>
            <li>I have used it exactly how directed &amp; nothing.</li>
            <li>Breasts are larger, firmer, more</li>
            <li>, the pot really is tiny and they don&#x27;t even fill the pot to the top.</li>
            <li>and I personally would not give over this much cash again when I could buy something more meaningful and longer lasting, like a new pair of heels!!</li>
            <li>So I&#x27;m excited to say that after nearly 3 months of naturaful the girls are looking more young and perky rather than old and shriveled up.</li>
            <li>I am happy to recommend Naturaful to everyone!&lt;br /&gt;After having three babies, my breasts were seriously sagging.</li>
            <li>One last thing ladies, please make sure you use it had directed and get the instructional video from the seller because you really need to follow that.</li>
            <li>When I brought it directly from the Naturaful website the cream was more of a clear consistency, from amazon</li>
            <li>Hi, I was real skeptic of this at first has there are a lot of creams on the market that say they increase you breast size</li>
            <li>I am excited to see what a few more months of naturaful will do.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use and I am back to the firmness that feels like me!!</li>
            <li>I had very high hopes for this product, but after using 4 out of the 5 jars I bought I have yet to see any results.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;ve been using this product along with suddenly fem breast booster and solaray female hormones and i&#x27;m getting amazing results</li>
            <li>Dont really see any difference.</li>
            <li>50ml really isn&#x27;t a month supply.</li>
            <li>This didn&#x27;t work at all for me and made me really sticky.</li>
            <li>After contemplating for awhile I decided to give this a shot after really reading up on the product.</li>
            <li>Thanks, Jennifer.</li>
            <li>fast delivery.&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it to women of all ages to enhance your breasts!</li>
            <li>This whole are is your breast tissue.</li>
            <li>so that does seem promising</li>
            <li>but he said your boobs got bigger and all I could do was smile with excitement!</li>
            <li>this difference is due to normal hormonal changes in my cycle, as I appreciate that 2 weeks isn&#x27;t a good enough trial.</li>
            <li>Slow and steady may work better for me than fast and quick.  </li>
            <li>Not sure it is effective or not, I must wait for longer</li>
            <li>but when it comes down to it most just want you money.</li>
            <li>but you have to be realistic with the results.</li>
            <li>/&gt;You do have to have your pores be open for this product to work well, If you can&#x27;t take a hot shower, use a washcloth and get it hot and lay it on your chest.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it twice a day almost every day, with the blow dryer and after showers just like the instructions say to, and I have noticed that my breasts are a little rounder, but nothing worth getting excited over.  </li>
            <li>They are overall both more full and firm then they have been.</li>
            <li>all woman have results like others&amp;#34; cause theres a high chance that can be you</li>
            <li>TO APPLY IT PROPERLY you must use a hot towel or take a hot bath or shower to make sure you open up your pores and glands then apply it and then blow dry or apply a heating pad.</li>
            <li>and she has noticed more fullness\firmness and will continue for a few months to maximize her results.  </li>
            <li>I bought a 3 month supply and right now im on my second week.</li>
            <li>I have now used it for about a month and a week and have seen a significant increase in the fullness not exactly the size yet though I&#x27;ll have to wait</li>
            <li>One way to tell you used enough hot water on your breasts is when they become veiny.</li>
            <li>IT helps dry the cream and sticks to your skins so it can be absorbed by the body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>yet I&#x27;ve nearly finished my first jar and onto my second</li>
            <li>So naturally have your significant other (or yourself)</li>
            <li>and i hardly have anything going on up top.</li>
            <li>Ive used it for 2 months so far and LOST a cup size.</li>
            <li>always busy working two jobs and with my daughter</li>
            <li>I am 21 years old</li>
            <li>Please do not waste your time or money!!!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I finally fit fully into a 34 B and both my breasts have evened out(one use to be slightly smaller than the other).</li>
            <li>First of all let me just say this, if you have SMALL breasts as in an A cup or smaller then this product is right for you.</li>
            <li>If youre too busy to apply it twice daily like me what I do is I apply it after a hot bath or shower, blow dry and reapply and blowdry again.</li>
            <li>When researching, I noticed most the negative reviews were by people who only used it for a month or 2.</li>
            <li>Awwful I used this product exactly as instructed and had absolutely NO results!</li>
            <li>If you have small breast like I do it&#x27;s not a big problem however someone with bigger breast may need more the just a dime of cream per use.</li>
            <li>Their 60 days money back guarantee is a complete joke.</li>
            <li>But so far that is my only complaint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>they actually promote growth naturally</li>
            <li>Only reason I gave the cream a 4 because I&#x27;m still in the early stages of use of the product.</li>
            <li>Also they were accurate about the side affects(swollen feeling) which left me with no doubt about anything negative happening.</li>
            <li>I tried Naturaful and was pleasantly surprised, not only with the value, but the results after a short while.</li>
            <li>It is the first product that works, just a little bit, but it works.</li>
            <li>It works somewhat, I guess a little more time is needed, only been using it for a few months.</li>
            <li>Not to get to graphic here, but my boyfriend barely had a handful before using it, now they are at the point where they are larger than a handful for him.</li>
            <li>My smaller breast is the same size as my other one, which is the main reason why I wanted to try this cream.</li>

            <li> TO APPLY IT PROPERLY you must use a hot towel or take a hot bath or shower to make sure you open up your pores and glands then apply it and then blow dry or apply a heating pad.</li>
            <li> and she has noticed more fullness\firmness and will continue for a few months to maximize her results.  </li>
            <li> I bought a 3 month supply and right now im on my second week.</li>
            <li> I have now used it for about a month and a week and have seen a significant increase in the fullness not exactly the size yet though I&#x27;ll have to wait</li>
            <li> One way to tell you used enough hot water on your breasts is when they become veiny.</li>
            <li> IT helps dry the cream and sticks to your skins so it can be absorbed by the body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> yet I&#x27;ve nearly finished my first jar and onto my second</li>
            <li> So naturally have your significant other (or yourself)</li>
            <li> and i hardly have anything going on up top.</li>
            <li> Ive used it for 2 months so far and LOST a cup size.</li>
            <li> always busy working two jobs and with my daughter</li>
            <li> I am 21 years old</li>
            <li> Please do not waste your time or money!!!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I finally fit fully into a 34 B and both my breasts have evened out(one use to be slightly smaller than the other).</li>
            <li> First of all let me just say this, if you have SMALL breasts as in an A cup or smaller then this product is right for you.</li>
            <li> If youre too busy to apply it twice daily like me what I do is I apply it after a hot bath or shower, blow dry and reapply and blowdry again.</li>
            <li> When researching, I noticed most the negative reviews were by people who only used it for a month or 2.</li>
            <li> Awwful I used this product exactly as instructed and had absolutely NO results!</li>
            <li> If you have small breast like I do it&#x27;s not a big problem however someone with bigger breast may need more the just a dime of cream per use.</li>
            <li> Their 60 days money back guarantee is a complete joke.</li>
            <li> But so far that is my only complaint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> they actually promote growth naturally</li>
            <li> Only reason I gave the cream a 4 because I&#x27;m still in the early stages of use of the product.</li>
            <li> Also they were accurate about the side affects(swollen feeling) which left me with no doubt about anything negative happening.</li>
            <li> I tried Naturaful and was pleasantly surprised, not only with the value, but the results after a short while.</li>
            <li> It is the first product that works, just a little bit, but it works.</li>
            <li> It works somewhat, I guess a little more time is needed, only been using it for a few months.</li>
            <li> Not to get to graphic here, but my boyfriend barely had a handful before using it, now they are at the point where they are larger than a handful for him.</li>
            <li> My smaller breast is the same size as my other one, which is the main reason why I wanted to try this cream.</li>
            <li> So anyways if you have small breasts I think YOU WILL see a difference if you have medium not so much.</li>
            <li> I bought my first set of Naturaful jars 3 months ago, and I am starting to see a subtle change in my breast shape.</li>
            <li> So far I have been using this cream for 2 and a half weeks.</li>
            <li> only complaint really is the amount of cream you get in a jar.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe I spent so much money on a product that guarantees your boobs to enlarge and get firm.</li>
            <li> oh and the other reviews said that after you use the cream they go back the same size</li>
            <li> i stop for a long period  </li>
            <li> It does all it says as long as you follow the directions.</li>
            <li> also one is up further then the other one.</li>
            <li> I will use my last jar but I am not expecting too see any results, I just simply don&#x27;t want to waste it &amp;</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say that my cup size seems any bigger than when I first started, but the change in shape gives me hope that at least they&#x27;ll round out some!</li>
            <li> I usually put the cream on twice a day but with my busy work schedule</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a pretty poor amount of cream they give you</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll have to update this review further down the line in case</li>
            <li> Before, I had triangular shaped breasts from a profile stance, but I&#x27;m starting to see some roundness on the lower half.</li>
            <li> BUT I only notice a SLIGHT change.</li>
            <li> I do feel soreness and tenderness but as for size and perkiness it&#x27;s only slightly.</li>
            <li> Ladies be careful about the warning &amp;#34;not</li>
            <li> While it does firm, which gives the illusion of enlargement, it does not actually increase breast size.</li>
            <li> a try harder to fallow im setting my alarm to remind me as im typing</li>
            <li> then I expected.</li>
            <li> and I believe I am seeing a minimal gain</li>
            <li> Only complaint so far is the small amount of cream.</li>
            <li> Take a chance if you want from the other opinions</li>
            <li> I followed the instructions very carefully.  </li>
            <li> They only negative I have is that my breast are somewhat sore feeling but nothing that is intolerable.</li>
            <li> Either way, waste of money, thought I saw progress in the first 3 months, nope, I was wrong.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> also my boobs went down one size</li>
            <li> You must also use this product forever just to get a slight result.</li>
            <li> I have already used a jar and a half, and I have not yet seen any results, almost two months already.</li>
            <li> and they are a lot firmer and less pointy in a sense.</li>
            <li> I have been using the product for a little over 3 weeks now</li>
            <li> A little over scented.</li>
            <li> and it still gets a little tinglely....</li>
            <li> Dont waste your money.</li>
            <li> WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY.</li>
            <li> This was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> it got firm</li>
            <li> Wasted a lot of money hoping this would work, it still hasn&#x27;t after 5 months</li>
            <li> It has helped me firm up my ta-tas</li>
            <li> and i still have to shop in the little girls section, its embarrasing!</li>
            <li> Was initially a little disappointed at not seeing much of a difference</li>
            <li> Waste your money!</li>
            <li> wearing swim suits are embarassing to cause there are not many padded swim suits out there.</li>
            <li> I used to have very heavy periods</li>
            <li> I am really disappointed, I really do feel like there&#x27;s no hope in making them grow just one cup size</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s too late to return it.</li>
            <li> (at least for me)&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m</li>
            <li> massage them at least once a day besides the 2 applications.</li>
            <li> Just gives a subtle fullness.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a small 32a bra size and have always been unhappy with my size and thought I should give it a go as an alternative to surgery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> While I have not noticed dramatic size increase, I have noticed measured improvement in the fullness of my breasts.  </li>
            <li> my boobs now feel raw painful and squishy</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a little disappointed.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t purchase again &amp; unfortunately that&#x27;s what has happened.</li>
            <li> well I can tell you that&#x27;s wrong</li>
            <li> Just a test to see if any random person that didn&#x27;t buy the cream can leave a review.  </li>
            <li> The 5 star reviews seem extremely fake.  </li>
            <li> *** are fake.</li>
            <li> Disappointing.</li>
            <li> This product is very expensive for no reason at all...  </li>
            <li> It feels like glue and smells so bad.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed for not paying close attention to the reviews.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed and unhappy!</li>
            <li> Terrible don&#x27;t buy!</li>
            <li> /&gt;You will be highly disappointed!!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Awesome product and quick receipt of product.</li>
            <li> Dont waste your money. Ive used it for 2 months so far and LOST a cup size. Not only did it do nothing to help get back boobs i lost from lifting weights, it threw my cycles way off track.</li>
            <li> Awwful I used this product exactly as instructed and had absolutely NO results! Ladies be careful about the warning &amp;#34;not all woman have results like others&amp;#34; cause theres a high chance that can be you</li>
            <li> For breast enlargement, it works some what but you have to be realistic with the results. It&#x27;s not a breast implant as some may think. Just gives a subtle fullness. I used it mainly for estrogen factor and loved the smell.</li>
            <li> After turning 44ish, I noticed a change and lost some of my breast firmness. I tried Naturaful and was pleasantly surprised, not only with the value, but the results after a short while. It is easy to use and I am back to the firmness that feels like me!! Thank you!</li>
            <li> It works somewhat, I guess a little more time is needed, only been using it for a few months.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product over a month! I can  already see the result!</li>
            <li> DO NOT!!!! Waste your money! I used 5 jars, applying twice a day and my breast size DID NOT change at all. Contains paraben that causes cancer. Their good reviews must be biased or paid. Their 60 days money back guarantee is a complete joke. You cannot return any open jars and need to be before 60 days which contradicts everything. They are saying results takes more than 3 to 6 months, then how would one know if their return policy is only for two months. Very disappointed and unhappy! Stop scamming people Naturalful!!!!</li>
            <li> NOT EVEN A ONE STAR. I can&#x27;t believe I spent so much money on a product that guarantees your boobs to enlarge and get firm. my boobs now feel raw painful and squishy also my boobs went down one size also one is up further then the other one. I went to the doctors and said It wasn&#x27;t a allergic reaction to the cream but it was the cream that did it. and they give you only 60 days. I did this product for 9 months and still nothing. WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY. having now go get surgery done to make me feel better. should have gotten implants in the first place.. CRAPPY PRODUCT!!! DON&amp;#34;T BUY. for your own self confidence</li>
            <li> I bought my first set of Naturaful jars 3 months ago, and I am starting to see a subtle change in my breast shape. Before, I had triangular shaped breasts from a profile stance, but I&#x27;m starting to see some roundness on the lower half. I can&#x27;t say that my cup size seems any bigger than when I first started, but the change in shape gives me hope that at least they&#x27;ll round out some! I&#x27;ll update after my full nine months is up.</li>
            <li> Excellent customer service, my needs were listened to and met. It was an absolute pleasure to do business with the people of Naturaful!</li>
            <li> While it does firm, which gives the illusion of enlargement, it does not actually increase breast size. You must also use this product forever just to get a slight result. Once you stop it&#x27;s back to what you started with. By the time you&#x27;ve reached a couple of years using this you could have had implants in one shot.  Only nature or breast implants will give you the results you&#x27;re looking for. This was a waste of money. Take a chance if you want from the other opinions but this is mine and I personally would not give over this much cash again when I could buy something more meaningful and longer lasting, like a new pair of heels!!</li>
            <li> It is still too soon to judge, but in my opinion (I underline &amp;#34;in my opinion&amp;#34;) it is working. Let&#x27;s see in two months.</li>
            <li> Dont really see any difference.</li>
            <li> Has not grown yet well for me but my friends say they see a difference all i see is it got firm but hopefully it would work it could easily but its my fault im not fallowing the schedule at times i stop for a long period  i forget sometimes since im always busy working two jobs and with my daughter but ima try harder to fallow im setting my alarm to remind me as im typing this lol hopefully it works lets see</li>
            <li> Very happy with all the results of the three month supply I got! I will definitely continue to use it!</li>
            <li> Great product with a nice smell. Works well and has a calming feel when applying. Have used this product for awhile and went up 2 cup sizes. Very Happy!</li>
            <li> I had very high hopes for this product, but after using 4 out of the 5 jars I bought I have yet to see any results. I have used it exactly how directed &amp; nothing. When researching, I noticed most the negative reviews were by people who only used it for a month or 2. That&#x27;s why I decided to get a 5 month supply. I was hopeful for results but I figured after all those jars if I saw no change I wouldn&#x27;t purchase again &amp; unfortunately that&#x27;s what has happened. Also, I don&#x27;t believe the reviews that say they saw results in a couple weeks, everyone&#x27;s body is different, yes, but I just don&#x27;t believe them now that I&#x27;ve used them product. I will use my last jar but I am not expecting too see any results, I just simply don&#x27;t want to waste it &amp; it&#x27;s too late to return it. I will not purchase again. The formula is also not parabin free.</li>
            <li> I am happy to recommend Naturaful to everyone!&lt;br /&gt;After having three babies, my breasts were seriously sagging. I stumble&lt;br /&gt;across this product while surfing and thought I should give it a try. After&lt;br /&gt;4 months, I have gained a full cup size. Breasts are larger, firmer, more lifting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a very good product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition, I also find Naturaful a company genuinely cares about its customers.&lt;br /&gt;So, all in all, I a very happy experience in using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am still continuing with the product. Hopefully, will get further improvements.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy anonymous NZ customer</li>
            <li> I am 21 years old and i hardly have anything going on up top. Im about a 32 a cup and i still have to shop in the little girls section, its embarrasing! wearing swim suits are embarassing to cause there are not many padded swim suits out there. Surgery isnt an option!! I have tried the bust boom pills and they didnt work and now im am trying naturaful. I bought a 3 month supply and right now im on my second week. I havent seen changes yet but i know it takes a while to see results. I am hoping this will work!</li>
            <li> My breasts have two different sizes and I keep using this product for almost three months and now they are almost the same size!!! I will keep using it to enlarge my breasts more!</li>
            <li> Naturaful has provided excellent customer service and I would definitely recommend them based on it. I can definitely say it&#x27;s a lot better than many other companies I&#x27;ve experienced on the internet.</li>
            <li> So far I have been using this cream for 2 and a half weeks. And I can honestly say that I believe it has improved my breasts already. Whilst there has been no increase in actual measurements, they just seem to look fuller and they feel firmer. I took pictures of myself to compare and there is quite a difference in the fullness. They look more rounded. I&#x27;ll have to update this review further down the line in case this difference is due to normal hormonal changes in my cycle, as I appreciate that 2 weeks isn&#x27;t a good enough trial. I&#x27;m a small 32a bra size and have always been unhappy with my size and thought I should give it a go as an alternative to surgery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint really is the amount of cream you get in a jar. I&#x27;ve been using pretty small amounts twice a day yet I&#x27;ve nearly finished my first jar and onto my second yet it&#x27;s meant to be a 3 month supply. For the amount you pay it&#x27;s a pretty poor amount of cream they give you, the pot really is tiny and they don&#x27;t even fill the pot to the top. 50ml really isn&#x27;t a month supply. But so far that is my only complaint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I realise this review isn&#x27;t the most helpful at the moment but I shall update in a months time.</li>
            <li> I have now used it for about a month and a week and have seen a significant increase in the fullness not exactly the size yet though I&#x27;ll have to wait but I think by the end of month 2 and beginning of month 3 I&#x27;ll start to see a change, praying and hoping it works, oh and the other reviews said that after you use the cream they go back the same size well I can tell you that&#x27;s wrong they actually promote growth naturally overtime I read it from another review and it makes perfect sense because it&#x27;s all natural ingredients so it&#x27;s not like a chemical substance that lifts your bust and then stops, it actually works with your body naturally safe and effectively :)</li>
            <li> One month and one jar later have not seen any results.</li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t work at all for me and made me really sticky. It feels like glue and smells so bad.</li>
            <li> Hi, I was real skeptic of this at first has there are a lot of creams on the market that say they increase you breast size but when it comes down to it most just want you money. After contemplating for awhile I decided to give this a shot after really reading up on the product. (brought 3 jars) It arrived a day earlier then I expected. I also followed up with the seller to get the instructional video and they were very quick to answer and send it to me. I have been using the product for a little over 3 weeks now and I believe I am seeing a minimal gain, I am making sure that I follow the suggested usage, I believe that is real important. I was not born with bigger breasts and I think it runs in my family, I guess when they said get on the truck to receive your breasts I kind of missed it.....:) Hopefully I will see more gain going forward has I keep using the product. The customer service team seems to really follow up with you once you reach out to them to make sure you are happy. One last thing ladies, please make sure you use it had directed and get the instructional video from the seller because you really need to follow that. I will try to post a follow up once I have used it more. Thanks, Jennifer.</li>
            <li> I have already used a jar and a half, and I have not yet seen any results, almost two months already. I am really disappointed, I really do feel like there&#x27;s no hope in making them grow just one cup size, I am just asking for a full B cup.. Oh well, guess I just got to love with what I got.</li>
            <li> It is the first product that works, just a little bit, but it works.</li>
            <li> One month in and nothing. I use a dryer and use it twice a day. I was hoping to get back to my pre-baby boobs, I guess it&#x27;s  surgery.</li>
            <li> I have been using the cream for almost a month now.. My smaller breast is the same size as my other one, which is the main reason why I wanted to try this cream. They are overall both more full and firm then they have been. I am very pleased with the results so far and will continue to use this product. They only negative I have is that my breast are somewhat sore feeling but nothing that is intolerable.</li>
            <li> I have been using this cream for 5 months now &amp; my breasts look a lot fuller &amp; feel softer &amp; I have gained an inch in size.  Was initially a little disappointed at not seeing much of a difference but around month 4 my breasts were a sore &amp; tender then I started noticing a difference in fullness.  Going to keep using it &amp; hopefully gain another inch.</li>
            <li> Im a guy for starter. Ive used this 5 jars worth and I feel off in the end but whe. I was using it twice aday after shower and adding heat as I apply it to open pore to allow it to soak in I want to an a cup from nothing</li>
            <li> I did not see any change even after using 4 jars. I&#x27;m disappointed for not paying close attention to the reviews.</li>
            <li> On my second bottle but changes in appearance and/or tingling sensation yet to be noted. Still hopeful.</li>
            <li> After breast feeding and breast pumping for a full year for each of 2 kids my breasts had definitely seen better days. So I&#x27;m excited to say that after nearly 3 months of naturaful the girls are looking more young and perky rather than old and shriveled up. The size has increased slightly, but I&#x27;m happy I don&#x27;t have to look at a couple of prunes every morning. I am excited to see what a few more months of naturaful will do.</li>
            <li> Disappointing. Wasted a lot of money hoping this would work, it still hasn&#x27;t after 5 months and I will not be wasting anymore money on it. When I brought it directly from the Naturaful website the cream was more of a clear consistency, from amazon it&#x27;s white and feels and looks like a lotion. Either way, waste of money, thought I saw progress in the first 3 months, nope, I was wrong. Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> this is a must buy it you need this.. it&#x27;s a process but it works and you must follow instructions!!</li>
            <li> It has not made a huge difference.  I began using it back in November, and I&#x27;m almost done with my second jar.  I&#x27;ve been using it twice a day almost every day, with the blow dryer and after showers just like the instructions say to, and I have noticed that my breasts are a little rounder, but nothing worth getting excited over.  I&#x27;m a little disappointed.</li>
            <li> Terrible don&#x27;t buy! They rip you off in every way possible! Charging just to return their lotion!</li>
            <li> fast delivery.&lt;br /&gt;Good Product.</li>
            <li> As many of you may be, I was somewhat hesitant about the ability of a cream to enhance one&#x27;s breast size.  I&#x27;ve now been using this product as directed for  5 weeks.  While I have not noticed dramatic size increase, I have noticed measured improvement in the fullness of my breasts.  It seems as if improvement for me will take time.  That&#x27;s okay with me.  Slow and steady may work better for me than fast and quick.  I will likely continue using this product for the recommended time period.  Only after that time period ends will I be able to make a full assessment.  But .... so far, so slowly good.</li>
            <li> Just a test to see if any random person that didn&#x27;t buy the cream can leave a review.  The 5 star reviews seem extremely fake.  I didn&#x27;t buy the cream and it seems I can leave a review.</li>
            <li> A little over scented. Definitely seeing results with regards to firming.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product!  Safe and easy cream to use once or twice a day. I highly recommend it to women of all ages to enhance your breasts!</li>
            <li> lol the reviews for this s*** are fake. click on the people who reviewed it and rated it five stars. it&#x27;s the only thing they&#x27;ve reviewed.</li>
            <li> I will not advise anyone to use this product because it doesn&#x27;t work is like throwing your money away. Nothing changed after using it for three months so please don&#x27;t allow yourself to be fooled like I was.</li>
            <li> I followed the instructions very carefully.  I am currently on a diet and feared of losing my cup size.  This product didn&#x27;t help to enhance my size let alone maintain it.  I&#x27;ve lost weight and it seems to all have been from my boobs.</li>
            <li> This product is very expensive for no reason at all...  I work out a lot so I wanted a cream that would help in the upper body area..&lt;br /&gt;Not worth your time or money, but it is a very good lotion if you don&#x27;t want dry skin, but that&#x27;s not what I purchased it for... After 3 months I didn&#x27;t see anything, so I went for month 4, 5, 6... To my surprise NOTHING!!!! I applied it morning and night, then I added on Morning, noon, and Night.. To my surprise NOTHING!!! Please do not waste your time or money!!!&lt;br /&gt;You will be highly disappointed!!!</li>
            <li> This stuff gave me dizziness and headaches, but the customer service was A+!</li>
            <li> I am a mom of 2 at the age of 32.  It does all it says as long as you follow the directions. (at least for me)&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m on my 8th week and on my 3rd jar. I&#x27;m a larger woman and was at a 40B....Now I am at a 38C! It has helped me firm up my ta-tas and I have lost about 10 lbs. from using it! I used to have very heavy periods and now they only last about 3 days and they are so light I almost don&#x27;t need feminine products! My libido has surely increased too! Not to get to graphic here, but my boyfriend barely had a handful before using it, now they are at the point where they are larger than a handful for him. He noticed it and he loves it too! In fact I told him and he&#x27;s buying my second batch for me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You do have to have your pores be open for this product to work well, If you can&#x27;t take a hot shower, use a washcloth and get it hot and lay it on your chest. Open them, up and then use an ample amount of cream. I used it liberally. And I followed directions and rubbed in, in a circle motion. I also made sure to get under the breast and up towards your collar bone. This whole are is your breast tissue. That it says to rub often to increase blood flow. So naturally have your significant other (or yourself) massage them at least once a day besides the 2 applications. And definitely use the hair dryer method. IT helps dry the cream and sticks to your skins so it can be absorbed by the body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m still using after 8 weeks and it still gets a little tinglely....it&#x27;s still working after all this time!</li>
            <li> The wife is going on 3 months of use and she has noticed more fullness\firmness and will continue for a few months to maximize her results.  Happy results so far!</li>
            <li> Hi everyone, I&#x27;m 21 and I decided to use naturaful for 3 months. It&#x27;s only been 2 weeks and I started at 32 1/2 inches and now I am 33 1/2. I was amazed at how I&#x27;ve already grown in that short period of time. I usually put the cream on twice a day but with my busy work schedule I sometimes only do it once. Also some nights once after I have applied the cream I use a warm hot pack to help blood flow to my breast n massage them twice a week. I didn&#x27;t tell my boyfriend what I was doing but he said your boobs got bigger and all I could do was smile with excitement! I have notice they are rounder at the bottom of my breast and they are a lot firmer and less pointy in a sense. Only reason I gave the cream a 4 because I&#x27;m still in the early stages of use of the product. Only complaint so far is the small amount of cream. If you have small breast like I do it&#x27;s not a big problem however someone with bigger breast may need more the just a dime of cream per use. I hope this helps!</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve been using this product along with suddenly fem breast booster and solaray female hormones and i&#x27;m getting amazing results</li>
            <li> Not sure it is effective or not, I must wait for longer</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m more than content with this product. This is the second time I&#x27;ve ordered this and each time I&#x27;ve seen results. I finally fit fully into a 34 B and both my breasts have evened out(one use to be slightly smaller than the other). Also they were accurate about the side affects(swollen feeling) which left me with no doubt about anything negative happening. Each time the shipping has gotten to me sooner than they said it would arrive. I&#x27;m also really happy because it&#x27;s all natural and it&#x27;s not a pill. Its really simple to apply to your breasts and I&#x27;m just overall really happy with the product!</li>
            <li> First of all let me just say this, if you have SMALL breasts as in an A cup or smaller then this product is right for you. If you&#x27;re like me and you have a B cup and you want to become a C cup or D cup than this product MIGHT NOT work. Now DO NOT quote me on this because I only been using this for a month or so...BUT I only notice a SLIGHT change. HOWEVER...there IS hope for me...BECAUSE... I do feel soreness and tenderness but as for size and perkiness it&#x27;s only slightly. Let&#x27;s hope this works out for me when the 3 months are up they say it takes up to 3 months to have affects. If you do buy this product MAKE SURE TO APPLY IT PROPERLY you must use a hot towel or take a hot bath or shower to make sure you open up your pores and glands then apply it and then blow dry or apply a heating pad. One way to tell you used enough hot water on your breasts is when they become veiny. You must do this atleast once or twice a day. If youre too busy to apply it twice daily like me what I do is I apply it after a hot bath or shower, blow dry and reapply and blowdry again. Anyways I do feel soreness like I did in puberty so that does seem promising and my boyfriend said it&#x27;s working but he could just be saying that to make me happy...who knows. So anyways if you have small breasts I think YOU WILL see a difference if you have medium not so much.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see no change of anything</li>
