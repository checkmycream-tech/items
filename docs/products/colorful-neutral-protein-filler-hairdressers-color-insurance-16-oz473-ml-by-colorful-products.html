            <li>Very good restorer!</li>
            <li>I am very happy with this product.</li>
            <li>Amazon sells it for a very good price.</li>
            <li>Good buy!  </li>
            <li>My color looks great and always has.  </li>
            <li>This is a GREAT product.</li>
            <li>Works great when coloring hair at home to give even coverage.</li>
            <li>but when I did worked great to give even color coverage and now gives great protien boost to my hair when used just alone.</li>
            <li>It also makes a great between-coloring conditioner to retain color.</li>
            <li>and i have great result.</li>
            <li>OMG this stuff works and is fantastic just after one use!!!</li>
            <li>Fantastic!!!  </li>
            <li>This is this the best conditioner - put this on your hair for as many hours as you have time for - it makes your hair silky smooth and keeps color well - buy this!!!</li>
            <li>Amazing!</li>
            <li>Also, it does work as an amazing conditioner... try it!</li>
            <li>My son has been colouring his hair with bright demi permanent colours after bleaching it for 2 years.</li>
            <li>I did follow up with a good moisturizing conditioner afterwards to balance it out.</li>
            <li>The results were that good.</li>
            <li>I was very pleased with this product.  </li>
            <li>Anyways, heard great reviews from tons of people with hair that was wayyyy more damaged than mine</li>
            <li>Great for keeping hair healthy.</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>Amazing product.</li>
            <li>We are thrilled with the results.</li>
            <li>honestly believe this was the reason my hair turned out just how I wanted it.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it helps with my dye jobs, according to my own judgment.  </li>
            <li>After using color remover, I used this neutral protein filler with my hair color and it made my color very even and awesome!</li>
            <li>Love, love, love it!!</li>
            <li>I think it works better than aphogee&#x27;s and Dudley&#x27;s DRC protein treatment in my opinion and those both cost MORE than this one</li>
            <li>I was hoping that using this before Manic Panic would help the color be more even, but I don&#x27;t think it helped.</li>
            <li>It is my favorite hair product.</li>
            <li>I researched, researched and researched more.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it might work better with a perm dye.  </li>
            <li>The results were SO MUCH BETTER than before.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This didn&#x27;t help my hair hold dye any better.</li>
            <li>You will get many uses out of it.</li>
            <li>so I thought if this stuff worked for them, it will surely work for me</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>so the hair dye sticks better to your hair.</li>
            <li>But I bought it anyway because I figured if it makes the color stick better, than why not.</li>
            <li>Fantastic!</li>
            <li>Love it and will order again:-)</li>
            <li>and she was satisfied with the outcome.</li>
            <li>My hair came out strong and healthy looking after.</li>
            <li>Great product , work in my hair leave very soft and shine and not damage</li>
            <li>I tried the aphogee 2 step and the 2 minute reconstructor which helped somewhat manage it but this colorful neutral protein filler did more for my hair than the aphogee system, coconut and olive oil!</li>
            <li>so I needed something strong that will help repair it.</li>
            <li>It made my hair feel so strong and healthier after coloring.</li>
            <li>Love, love, love it - can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li>I read about this product online and decided to order &amp; give it a try because I have fine hair that is damaged</li>
            <li>but I really feel compelled to spread the word about this Neutral Protein Filler because it is truly an amazing hair product.</li>
            <li>If you have bleached your hair or if you have some gray, this is essential for a successful DIY hair coloring experience.</li>
            <li>This is available elsewhere in smaller sizes but this one on Amazon is by far the best value.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair nice and soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>(I used Vidal Sassoon&#x27;s Medium Cool Brown).  </li>
            <li>One sprayed on application of the protein filler and the improvement was extraordinary.</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m glad I can get a bigger bottle for a better price.</li>
            <li>This is by far hands down the best protein treatment I have ever used.</li>
            <li>This product fixed my hair so it took color very well, and the transition in color between the new growth and old growth was the best I have ever had.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the best kept secret treatment for brittle and/or damaged hair.</li>
            <li>worth it for me.</li>
            <li>This is something you need to make a messy dye job look near perfect.</li>
            <li>I had two-toned hair:  brown on the bottom, and light blonde on top.  </li>
            <li>I read articles, I gathered pictures (to find the right shade for me) and asked questions.</li>
            <li>when I straightened it, the color came right out</li>
            <li>It helps the hair to be stronger, helps with frizzies, and makes your hair healthy in general.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t usually post reviews, but I&#x27;m really happy with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Helped me go from bleached blonde to a gorgeous natural auburn.</li>
            <li>This is my new religion and if it helped save my over processed, fried hair and prevented me from going bald, then it can save your hair too!!!</li>
            <li>My hair is a very light sand blonde now.</li>
            <li>My hair has improved so very much.</li>
            <li>the rest of us don&#x27;t - use this every week or every other week and your hair will be stronger and thicker - even my hairdresser was surprised at the great condition my hair was in</li>
            <li>I dyed my hair with permanent dye for the first time in my life (30 years) a bit ago</li>
            <li>product is an absolute must buy!</li>
            <li>Thanks for nothing!</li>
            <li>This is a generous size that will last many colorings.</li>
            <li>I applied color after, and it exactly matched the box.  </li>
            <li>EXACTLY,</li>
            <li>and it was very evenly distributed!  </li>
            <li>I now use it every time I do a touchup of any kind (other than my regular color depositing conditioner) just to make sure everything stays even.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have bleached my hair so many times &amp; have changed colors from purple to blue which caused so much damage but the cherry on top was my attempt to go platinum blonde to get silver hair...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been highlighting my thinning and very fine hair for awhile and even without lightening there are sections that are always frizzy and dry, regardless of which conditioners I try.</li>
            <li>It puts protein back in the hair shaft and makes the hair look healthy and keep the color much longer.</li>
            <li>It is sooooo effective and makes at home hair coloring a success, rather than a mess!</li>
            <li>When I first died over bleach the color did not stick to the hair but the filler really helps.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s really long - and it is not expensive!!!</li>
            <li>I believe this product helps that bit of hair grab the dye initially, but I find that the dye still fades very quickly, faster than the rest of my hair.  </li>
            <li>Enter Colorful Neutral Protein Filler, with &amp;#34;bio-active protein,&amp;#34; a product that is meant to &amp;#34;equalize hair porosity for even color absorption&amp;#34; by &amp;#34;repairing previously damaged protein bonds.&amp;#34; This stuff is MAGIC</li>
            <li>My hair is fine and relaxed so this will definitely be a sample for me.</li>
            <li>Maybe this is the only think that actually works for my porous and super damaged hair, It contains mostly protein, without silicones and additives,.</li>
            <li>so I bought and used it before applying L&#x27;oreal preference mega red light intense copper.  </li>
            <li>This Neutral Protein Filer makes my hair feel so much stronger than it did before I started using it.</li>
            <li>and I was really nervous.</li>
            <li>but it doesn&#x27;t fix the porosity that much.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really know what to make of this product.  </li>
            <li>It really works.</li>
            <li>I wanted then went out and bought every light copper hair dye from every brand known to man with always the same result.  </li>
            <li>Really cannot tell a difference.</li>
            <li>I have one particular section of hair that is very damaged from having been bleached a while ago.  </li>
            <li>I used this for the first time yesterday and WOW....</li>
            <li>main concern with this product was that it was going to make my hair toooo even</li>
            <li>I recommend this product to anyone who double (or more) processes their hair on a regular basis to counteract the porosity.</li>
            <li>I bleached my hair twice last year to the exact light copper blonde</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it for people with fine hair that is breaking and/or damaged due to relaxing and/or coloring.</li>
            <li>The colour no longer stayed more than a few days.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I just had my hair cut yesterday with a new stylist.  </li>
            <li>I recently damaged most of my hair by processing, so that without conditioners it feels like straw when wet.</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>I order from Amazon often and usually get free shipping, so I really didn&#x27;t pay attention to the shipping costs when I ordered this.  </li>
            <li>I paid dearly for shipping and purchased a large bottle so if need be we would have it for the future.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, half the bottle spilled out during shipping, but nonetheless, worth the money!</li>
            <li>not doing much to keep the color in my dyed hair, maybe a day or two longer only</li>
            <li>My hair was very over-processd and this stuff brought it back to life.  </li>
            <li>Professional salon application included, permanent color is gone within weeks.</li>
            <li>Your hair color goes on evenly and your hair feels so soft.  </li>
            <li>I used it twice so far.</li>
            <li>My hair was all a uniform white-blonde with not a single lavender streak and was very soft as well.</li>
            <li>As many other women, I&#x27;ve dyed and re-dyed my hair numerous times, which made my hair dry and brittle.</li>
            <li>I towel dried and applied Protein Filler using a spray bottle, making sure to fully saturate the pesky streaky areas, then let it dry for 20-30 minutes, applied the T18 toner and when I rinsed it out-PERFECTION!</li>
            <li>after my 3rd dye job attempt and my hair becoming various shades of black cherry, I learned about this filler.  </li>
            <li>I followed the instructions that both companies themselves say to do regarding their products and got the same old same old!  </li>
            <li>Until recently I always had everything done professionally, but not one pro ever suggested protein filler, either in the salon or at home.</li>
            <li>Therefore my natural highlights are still there only in a redder shade.</li>
            <li>My natural lowlights are visible but in a red shade.</li>
            <li>My hair is multidimensional and I barely had to try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Then I remove the excess with a towel and blow-dry my hair until barely damp.  </li>
            <li>My hair feels soft again and it actually moves when I flip my hair!!</li>
            <li>My hair naturally pulls red</li>
            <li>I last dyed my hair a dark golden brown two weeks ago, and by today that patch of hair has already faded to a medium reddish brown.  </li>
            <li>I also treat my hair with a pure coconut oil about every other week</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Enter Colorful Neutral Protein Filler, with &amp;#34;bio-active protein,&amp;#34; a product that is meant to &amp;#34;equalize hair porosity for even color absorption&amp;#34; by &amp;#34;repairing previously damaged protein bonds.&amp;#34; This stuff is MAGIC</li>
            <li> My hair is fine and relaxed so this will definitely be a sample for me.</li>
            <li> Maybe this is the only think that actually works for my porous and super damaged hair, It contains mostly protein, without silicones and additives,.</li>
            <li> so I bought and used it before applying L&#x27;oreal preference mega red light intense copper.  </li>
            <li> This Neutral Protein Filer makes my hair feel so much stronger than it did before I started using it.</li>
            <li> and I was really nervous.</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t fix the porosity that much.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really know what to make of this product.  </li>
            <li> It really works.</li>
            <li> I wanted then went out and bought every light copper hair dye from every brand known to man with always the same result.  </li>
            <li> Really cannot tell a difference.</li>
            <li> I have one particular section of hair that is very damaged from having been bleached a while ago.  </li>
            <li> I used this for the first time yesterday and WOW....</li>
            <li> main concern with this product was that it was going to make my hair toooo even</li>
            <li> I recommend this product to anyone who double (or more) processes their hair on a regular basis to counteract the porosity.</li>
            <li> I bleached my hair twice last year to the exact light copper blonde</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it for people with fine hair that is breaking and/or damaged due to relaxing and/or coloring.</li>
            <li> The colour no longer stayed more than a few days.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I just had my hair cut yesterday with a new stylist.  </li>
            <li> I recently damaged most of my hair by processing, so that without conditioners it feels like straw when wet.</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> I order from Amazon often and usually get free shipping, so I really didn&#x27;t pay attention to the shipping costs when I ordered this.  </li>
            <li> I paid dearly for shipping and purchased a large bottle so if need be we would have it for the future.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, half the bottle spilled out during shipping, but nonetheless, worth the money!</li>
            <li> not doing much to keep the color in my dyed hair, maybe a day or two longer only</li>
            <li> My hair was very over-processd and this stuff brought it back to life.  </li>
            <li> Professional salon application included, permanent color is gone within weeks.</li>
            <li> Your hair color goes on evenly and your hair feels so soft.  </li>
            <li> I used it twice so far.</li>
            <li> My hair was all a uniform white-blonde with not a single lavender streak and was very soft as well.</li>
            <li> As many other women, I&#x27;ve dyed and re-dyed my hair numerous times, which made my hair dry and brittle.</li>
            <li> I towel dried and applied Protein Filler using a spray bottle, making sure to fully saturate the pesky streaky areas, then let it dry for 20-30 minutes, applied the T18 toner and when I rinsed it out-PERFECTION!</li>
            <li> after my 3rd dye job attempt and my hair becoming various shades of black cherry, I learned about this filler.  </li>
            <li> I followed the instructions that both companies themselves say to do regarding their products and got the same old same old!  </li>
            <li> Until recently I always had everything done professionally, but not one pro ever suggested protein filler, either in the salon or at home.</li>
            <li> Therefore my natural highlights are still there only in a redder shade.</li>
            <li> My natural lowlights are visible but in a red shade.</li>
            <li> My hair is multidimensional and I barely had to try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Then I remove the excess with a towel and blow-dry my hair until barely damp.  </li>
            <li> My hair feels soft again and it actually moves when I flip my hair!!</li>
            <li> My hair naturally pulls red</li>
            <li> I last dyed my hair a dark golden brown two weeks ago, and by today that patch of hair has already faded to a medium reddish brown.  </li>
            <li> I also treat my hair with a pure coconut oil about every other week</li>
            <li> I bleach first and then use Wella hair color with purple undertones to get that ugly cheap bleach blonde look out of my hair.</li>
            <li> So, personally, this product may work for some, like if you have short hair (mine is long), but it did not go well with MY hair.</li>
            <li> All the processing has left my hair substantially damaged and porous and the main problem is/was that I have these random hyper-porous streaks all over my hair that absorb way too much of any purple-toned product I use such as the T18 or any toning shampoo, conditioner, etc.</li>
            <li> The Wella color charm hair color tones it down completely.</li>
            <li> From my personal experience, I followed the instructions on the bottle and it made my hair soooooo DRY and unmanagable</li>
            <li> Like way, WAY too much, the rest of my hair will be white and I&#x27;ll have these icky purple streaks that will not wash out with any product, not even Dawn dish soap.</li>
            <li> Uneven absorption and complete fade out after a week!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been dying my hair at home for years, and unfortunately, the color started collecting at my tips while my roots were really light.  </li>
            <li> I tried it the last time I retouched my black regrowth and was amazed by the results.</li>
            <li> I debated over actually dying it myself or forking over cash to get it done in a salon (at least for the initial color</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not really noticing a difference.</li>
            <li> If you have any broken ends this will help so much.</li>
            <li> but it never really worked out.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s only been a few weeks</li>
            <li> My hair was not very damaged at all</li>
            <li> Follow the directions carefully.</li>
            <li> so I didn&#x27;t order this from Amazon bc its less expensive at the site the last customer put up (thanks for that btw</li>
            <li> /&gt;I ended up using this twice during my dye process (initially for the 20 minute set-in period and then again mixed in with the second color I put on my head for my two step process dye job... had to go dark first to even out my head from the stupid sun&#x27;s highlights and lighter ends and then went all-over</li>
            <li> After using the small size, I ordered this larger bottle.</li>
            <li> I had used semi-permanent brown dye before to &amp;#34;go dark&amp;#34; from my usual blonde</li>
            <li> I do this about every week or every other.</li>
            <li> About me, I have typical Latin hair naturally- extremely thick, coarse, curly, and dark brown, almost black, just below the shoulders that I have been bleaching full-on white for over a year now with bleach and Wella T18 toner.</li>
            <li> I let it set for 30 minutes in a towel, then dried my hair to about 80% dry.  </li>
            <li> For several months my hair would not take hair coloring hardly at all, leaving me looking whitish.  </li>
            <li> , it felt like I just sprayed an entire bottle of hair spray on my hair that makes it sticky and hard to comb thru.</li>
            <li> Whether it&#x27;s damage from constant coloring, age, or hard well water, my hair will no longer hold any color.</li>
            <li> Sad, really.</li>
            <li> I can tell it immediately strengthen my hair and made it feel 100 xs stronger, fuller with LOTS of body and less prone to breakage once I rinsed and roller</li>
            <li> I read about porosity and all that and was worried I would completely mess up my hair.</li>
            <li> it was a mess</li>
            <li> A little pricey compared to places i have seen it</li>
            <li> Have been using this since I heard about it years ago and buying the little bottles at Sally</li>
            <li> Uneven hair color absorption and 1 week fade out of every hair color brand I bought.  </li>
            <li> Massively dried out my hair.  </li>
            <li> Used on my daughters hair that was over processed and unevenly colored.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been platinum for a couple years and wanted to go allot darker, Loreal&#x27;s black Cherry!  </li>
            <li> My hair is porous due to coloring and was beginning to look dried out and thin.</li>
            <li> couldn&#x27;t brush it without a ridiculous amount breaking off, it was so stiff when I tried to style it-</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t hard to work with</li>
            <li> /&gt;After all that research, this product seemed to be a common theme among reviewers, commenters, advice columnists and YouTubers.</li>
            <li> But that doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s not goog</li>
            <li> and I was a sad and depressed little girl.</li>
            <li> I also use this as a protien filler if my hair is feeling weak.</li>
            <li> and I was left with platinum hair again :(</li>
            <li> only annoying thing is that I had to discover this product while reading these Amazon reviews of a color product I was researching.</li>
            <li> Like everyone said it&#x27;s really expensive here</li>
            <li> Upkeep was getting to be too expensive, and too damaging.</li>
            <li> and I was going to end up with flat, boring color</li>
            <li> the shipping on Amazon for this is ridiculous!!!</li>
            <li> When I started coloring my hair, it was impossible to even comb it because of this protein filler.</li>
            <li> It was a bad look that I&#x27;d been battling for months.</li>
            <li> The texture was terrible.</li>
            <li> (It was awful!)</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Wow! This Protein Filler is wonderful.  I&#x27;ve been platinum for a couple years and wanted to go allot darker, Loreal&#x27;s black Cherry!  after my 3rd dye job attempt and my hair becoming various shades of black cherry, I learned about this filler.  I used it and recolored my hair. It didn&#x27;t fade. I love it!</li>
            <li> My son has been colouring his hair with bright demi permanent colours after bleaching it for 2 years. The colour no longer stayed more than a few days. I did some research and discovered that in order for the colour to stay, we had to repair his cuticle. For some reason this product is not sold anywhere in Canada. I paid dearly for shipping and purchased a large bottle so if need be we would have it for the future. We are thrilled with the results. His demi permanent colour has now lasted 3 weeks and doesn&#x27;t seem to be fading. Yay!</li>
            <li> OMG this stuff works and is fantastic just after one use!!! I read about this product online and decided to order &amp; give it a try because I have fine hair that is damaged so I needed something strong that will help repair it. I used this for the first time yesterday and WOW....Love, love, love it!! I can tell it immediately strengthen my hair and made it feel 100 xs stronger, fuller with LOTS of body and less prone to breakage once I rinsed and roller set. The results exceeded my expectations. This is by far hands down the best protein treatment I have ever used. I think it works better than aphogee&#x27;s and Dudley&#x27;s DRC protein treatment in my opinion and those both cost MORE than this one so go figure!! I was using aphogee but that has now been replaced with this!! I will continue to use this weekly because my hair loves protein. I did follow up with a good moisturizing conditioner afterwards to balance it out. My hair came out strong and healthy looking after. My hair is fine and relaxed so this will definitely be a sample for me. It&#x27;s the best kept secret treatment for brittle and/or damaged hair. Highly recommend it for people with fine hair that is breaking and/or damaged due to relaxing and/or coloring. Like everyone said it&#x27;s really expensive here so I didn&#x27;t order this from Amazon bc its less expensive at the site the last customer put up (thanks for that btw) bc the shipping on Amazon for this is ridiculous!!! This product is definitely the TRUTH!!!!</li>
            <li> This Neutral Protein Filer makes my hair feel so much stronger than it did before I started using it. When I color my hair it helps to even out the color all the way through my head of hair.</li>
            <li> For several months my hair would not take hair coloring hardly at all, leaving me looking whitish.  This product fixed my hair so it took color very well, and the transition in color between the new growth and old growth was the best I have ever had.  After using the small size, I ordered this larger bottle.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not really noticing a difference. I was hoping that using this before Manic Panic would help the color be more even, but I don&#x27;t think it helped. It also claims to be conditioning, which I didn&#x27;t notice.</li>
            <li> When I started to color my hair at home, my hair dresser told me to add this to my hair color so that it wouldn&#x27;t be streaked.  My color looks great and always has.  I use equal parts of the developer, the color and the protein filler.  I order from Amazon often and usually get free shipping, so I really didn&#x27;t pay attention to the shipping costs when I ordered this.  They almost DOUBLED the price of the product.  I should have ordered it at the local beauty supply, which normally only carries the smaller size.  This is a GREAT product.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love it - can&#x27;t live without it! As many other women, I&#x27;ve dyed and re-dyed my hair numerous times, which made my hair dry and brittle. This protein filler, when used before color application, conditions the hair, repairs it and lets hair color grab on evenly and without the dreaded oversaturation. It is sooooo effective and makes at home hair coloring a success, rather than a mess!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very impressed with this product! I&#x27;ve been highlighting my thinning and very fine hair for awhile and even without lightening there are sections that are always frizzy and dry, regardless of which conditioners I try. One sprayed on application of the protein filler and the improvement was extraordinary. I now use before any highlighting and even between times if needed. It looks fuller, healthier and shinier than it has in 30 years!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only annoying thing is that I had to discover this product while reading these Amazon reviews of a color product I was researching. Until recently I always had everything done professionally, but not one pro ever suggested protein filler, either in the salon or at home. Sad, really.</li>
            <li> My hair dresser told me years ago to mix this with my hair color before putting it on my hair. I never color my hair without adding this. It makes my hair nice and soft and smooth. If you have any broken ends this will help so much. It is my favorite hair product. If you use this once you will never do without it again.</li>
            <li> Hairdressers know about this protein filler but the rest of us don&#x27;t - use this every week or every other week and your hair will be stronger and thicker - even my hairdresser was surprised at the great condition my hair was in and it&#x27;s really long - and it is not expensive!!!</li>
            <li> If you color or bleach your hair, you need this product.  It helps the hair to be stronger, helps with frizzies, and makes your hair healthy in general.</li>
            <li> Great product , work in my hair leave very soft and shine and not damage&lt;br /&gt;after use coloring creme , come on time</li>
            <li> Amazing! I bleached the ever living out of my hair recently. Upkeep was getting to be too expensive, and too damaging. Used this to aid in my journey going back to a brunette. Helped distribute colour evenly, and locked it in. Unfortunately, half the bottle spilled out during shipping, but nonetheless, worth the money!</li>
            <li> A must have for anyone who dyes their hair at home! I dyed my hair with permanent dye for the first time in my life (30 years) a bit ago and I was really nervous. I read about porosity and all that and was worried I would completely mess up my hair. I had used semi-permanent brown dye before to &amp;#34;go dark&amp;#34; from my usual blonde but it never really worked out. It turns out I definitely didn&#x27;t know what I was doing back then.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This time I was going to &amp;#34;go red&amp;#34; and do it permanently. I needed all the help, advice, etc. that I could get. I researched, researched and researched more. I read articles, I gathered pictures (to find the right shade for me) and asked questions. I debated over actually dying it myself or forking over cash to get it done in a salon (at least for the initial color change).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After all that research, this product seemed to be a common theme among reviewers, commenters, advice columnists and YouTubers. I just had to purchase this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ended up using this twice during my dye process (initially for the 20 minute set-in period and then again mixed in with the second color I put on my head for my two step process dye job... had to go dark first to even out my head from the stupid sun&#x27;s highlights and lighter ends and then went all-over light).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I honestly believe this was the reason my hair turned out just how I wanted it. I now use it every time I do a touchup of any kind (other than my regular color depositing conditioner) just to make sure everything stays even.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My main concern with this product was that it was going to make my hair toooo even and I was going to end up with flat, boring color but it doesn&#x27;t fix the porosity that much. It just helps it. Therefore my natural highlights are still there only in a redder shade. My natural lowlights are visible but in a red shade. My hair is multidimensional and I barely had to try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is an absolute must buy!</li>
            <li> Works great when coloring hair at home to give even coverage. A little pricey compared to places i have seen it but it has the two day prime shipping. I also use this as a protien filler if my hair is feeling weak. I don&#x27;t color my hair anymore but when I did worked great to give even color coverage and now gives great protien boost to my hair when used just alone.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really know what to make of this product.  I don&#x27;t think it helps with my dye jobs, according to my own judgment.  For reference, I have only used this product with demis and perm dye combined with 10 vol developer to make it behave like a demi (both Ion brand), so I don&#x27;t know if it might work better with a perm dye.  I have used it by spraying it into my hair until the hair is saturated, then letting it process for the recommended 20 minute.  Then I remove the excess with a towel and blow-dry my hair until barely damp.  I also add some of this product to the dye mixture.  I have one particular section of hair that is very damaged from having been bleached a while ago.  I believe this product helps that bit of hair grab the dye initially, but I find that the dye still fades very quickly, faster than the rest of my hair.  I last dyed my hair a dark golden brown two weeks ago, and by today that patch of hair has already faded to a medium reddish brown.  I suppose I will simply have to keep using coconut oil to rejuvenate that bit of hair or else just grow it out.  Of course, by then I will essentially have no need for this product, unless I use it as a protein treatment, which I haven&#x27;t done, so I can&#x27;t comment on its efficacy in that regard.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with this product.  It made my hair feel so strong and healthier after coloring.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually post reviews, but I&#x27;m really happy with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been dying my hair at home for years, and unfortunately, the color started collecting at my tips while my roots were really light.  It was a bad look that I&#x27;d been battling for months. I used this before my last dye job.  (I used Vidal Sassoon&#x27;s Medium Cool Brown).  The results were SO MUCH BETTER than before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just had my hair cut yesterday with a new stylist.  He said, \\&quot;You don&#x27;t color your hair, right?\\&quot;  The results were that good.</li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t help my hair hold dye any better. I guess if your hair is as damaged as mine, nothing can help it.</li>
            <li> I have bleached my hair so many times &amp; have changed colors from purple to blue which caused so much damage but the cherry on top was my attempt to go platinum blonde to get silver hair...I did go platinum alright but had to cut off 70% of my hair because it was so gummy &amp; fried! I dyed it silver but it was so porous, when I straightened it, the color came right out and I was left with platinum hair again :( my hair was fried to the max and I couldn&#x27;t dye my hair, couldn&#x27;t brush it without a ridiculous amount breaking off, it was so stiff when I tried to style it- it was a mess and I was a sad and depressed little girl. I tried the aphogee 2 step and the 2 minute reconstructor which helped somewhat manage it but this colorful neutral protein filler did more for my hair than the aphogee system, coconut and olive oil! I put it on my fried, hay looking hair for 20 min and then put 1 ounce of it in the silver dye, left it for another 20 minutes and my fried hair improved by 80%! My hair feels soft again and it actually moves when I flip my hair!! I can run my fingers through it without them getting stuck and I don&#x27;t have anymore bird nests in my hair, it feels silky!?!? I&#x27;m so happy!! This is my new religion and if it helped save my over processed, fried hair and prevented me from going bald, then it can save your hair too!!!</li>
            <li> I bought a small bottle for a one time use at a beauty supply store first.  I bleached henna out of my hair so my hair was severely damaged. The texture was terrible. I heard about protein fillers so I thought I would give this a try. My hair is a very light sand blonde now. My hair naturally pulls red so I need a dye with purple undertones. I bleach first and then use Wella hair color with purple undertones to get that ugly cheap bleach blonde look out of my hair. The Wella color charm hair color tones it down completely. Anyway so this is how I take care of my bleached hair. I mix the protein filler with water and spray it on my hair and leave it on for 30 mins then I wash my hair with regular shampoo and conditioner. I do this about every week or every other. When I dye my hair I pour some of this protein filler in my hair dye to make the dye attach the the hair shaft. It really works. When I first died over bleach the color did not stick to the hair but the filler really helps. I also treat my hair with a pure coconut oil about every other week and I use a deep conditioner from Aussie ( 3 minute miracle). My hair has improved so very much. I recommend this product. Amazon sells it for a very good price. You will get many uses out of it. It lasts me several months!</li>
            <li> This product is awesome! My hair is porous due to coloring and was beginning to look dried out and thin. I read about this product, used it, and what a difference it makes! It puts protein back in the hair shaft and makes the hair look healthy and keep the color much longer. I never color my hair without using this product!</li>
            <li> I bought this filler to use before I dyed my hair.  It&#x27;s only been a few weeks so I can&#x27;t tell how well it works yet.</li>
            <li> I  was so hopeful and exited... for nothing!  I bleached my hair twice last year to the exact light copper blonde I wanted then went out and bought every light copper hair dye from every brand known to man with always the same result.  Uneven hair color absorption and 1 week fade out of every hair color brand I bought.  My hair was not very damaged at all so I didn&#x27;t understand what the problem was.  Anyways, heard great reviews from tons of people with hair that was wayyyy more damaged than mine so I thought if this stuff worked for them, it will surely work for me so I bought and used it before applying L&#x27;oreal preference mega red light intense copper.  I followed the instructions that both companies themselves say to do regarding their products and got the same old same old!  Uneven absorption and complete fade out after a week!  So since I&#x27;ve been going through this roller coaster for almost 6 months now, I&#x27;ve decided to give up and Neutral protein filler?  Thanks for nothing!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pleased with this product. I recently damaged most of my hair by processing, so that without conditioners it feels like straw when wet. I added this to my colorant and then to my conditioner and left it in for a while. When I rinsed (and since then) my hair definitely had an uptick in health, shine, and feel. Very good restorer! worth it for me.</li>
            <li> Only gave it 3 stars because it didn&#x27;t work for me. But that doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s not goog</li>
            <li> not doing much to keep the color in my dyed hair, maybe a day or two longer only</li>
            <li> Fantastic!!!  Helped me go from bleached blonde to a gorgeous natural auburn.</li>
            <li> This is something you need to make a messy dye job look near perfect. It works well. All hair stylist should use this but they don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Had to throw it away after one use.  Massively dried out my hair.  YMMV</li>
            <li> If you have bleached your hair or if you have some gray, this is essential for a successful DIY hair coloring experience. Follow the directions carefully. This is available elsewhere in smaller sizes but this one on Amazon is by far the best value. It also makes a great between-coloring conditioner to retain color.</li>
            <li> My hair was very over-processd and this stuff brought it back to life.  I&#x27;m using as a conditioner after my regular shampooing and it improoves with each use.  I&#x27;m sold and have made it a regular part of my hair care routine.  Wow!</li>
            <li> My hair became too porous, so it gripped onto the undertones on the ends and I had lighter roots than the rest of my hair. (It was awful!) After using color remover, I used this neutral protein filler with my hair color and it made my color very even and awesome! I am very happy with this product. I will not color without it! This is a generous size that will last many colorings.</li>
            <li> I got this product after watching a video clip on YouTube where the girl who was dying her hair red said to get this protein filler so the hair dye sticks better to your hair. Though when I went to Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply store, the woman did NOT mention at all about this product for me to buy it. But I bought it anyway because I figured if it makes the color stick better, than why not. From my personal experience, I followed the instructions on the bottle and it made my hair soooooo DRY and unmanagable, it felt like I just sprayed an entire bottle of hair spray on my hair that makes it sticky and hard to comb thru. So, personally, this product may work for some, like if you have short hair (mine is long), but it did not go well with MY hair. When I started coloring my hair, it was impossible to even comb it because of this protein filler. I am definitely NOT gonna use it again!</li>
            <li> Amazing product. Hair color went on evenly and retained the color longer. Would highly recommend. Used on my daughters hair that was over processed and unevenly colored. Can&#x27;t believe the results. Try this product.</li>
            <li> Great for keeping hair healthy.</li>
            <li> Whether it&#x27;s damage from constant coloring, age, or hard well water, my hair will no longer hold any color. Professional salon application included, permanent color is gone within weeks. I was hoping this would make a different and saw no improvement at all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not one to review beauty products but I really feel compelled to spread the word about this Neutral Protein Filler because it is truly an amazing hair product. About me, I have typical Latin hair naturally- extremely thick, coarse, curly, and dark brown, almost black, just below the shoulders that I have been bleaching full-on white for over a year now with bleach and Wella T18 toner. All the processing has left my hair substantially damaged and porous and the main problem is/was that I have these random hyper-porous streaks all over my hair that absorb way too much of any purple-toned product I use such as the T18 or any toning shampoo, conditioner, etc. Like way, WAY too much, the rest of my hair will be white and I&#x27;ll have these icky purple streaks that will not wash out with any product, not even Dawn dish soap. Enter Colorful Neutral Protein Filler, with &amp;#34;bio-active protein,&amp;#34; a product that is meant to &amp;#34;equalize hair porosity for even color absorption&amp;#34; by &amp;#34;repairing previously damaged protein bonds.&amp;#34; This stuff is MAGIC I tell ya! I tried it the last time I retouched my black regrowth and was amazed by the results. I followed the directions on the bottle-after I shampooed the bleach out I towel dried and applied Protein Filler using a spray bottle, making sure to fully saturate the pesky streaky areas, then let it dry for 20-30 minutes, applied the T18 toner and when I rinsed it out-PERFECTION! My hair was all a uniform white-blonde with not a single lavender streak and was very soft as well. I recommend this product to anyone who double (or more) processes their hair on a regular basis to counteract the porosity. It can also be used as an &amp;#34;active protein reconstructing conditioner&amp;#34; by diluting with 1/3 water which I&#x27;m going to try next wash. The bottle says to REFRIGERATE any leftover filler because it contains bio-active proteins and once diluted may spoil. I&#x27;m guessing those bio-active guys are what make this product work so well. TRY THIS PRODUCT!so well. TRY THIS PRODUCT!</li>
            <li> Fantastic! My review must have got lost.  As I said before, this is the thing everyone should use before coloring your hair.  Your hair color goes on evenly and your hair feels so soft.  Love it and will order again:-)</li>
            <li> Really cannot tell a difference.</li>
            <li> I did a lot of research prior to using this product.  I had two-toned hair:  brown on the bottom, and light blonde on top.  I added the filler with a bit of water (2/2 for water and product), and sprayed it on with a squirt bottle.  I let it set for 30 minutes in a towel, then dried my hair to about 80% dry.  I applied color after, and it exactly matched the box.  EXACTLY, and it was very evenly distributed!  I know that would not have happened if I had not used a filler.  Good buy!  Also, it does work as an amazing conditioner... try it!</li>
            <li> Maybe this is the only think that actually works for my porous and super damaged hair, It contains mostly protein, without silicones and additives,. 10 min under the dryer and i have great result. I would recommend this product definitely!</li>
            <li> My wife wanted to do her hair and I got elected. Wasn&#x27;t hard to work with and she was satisfied with the outcome.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see any difference with this product. In fact I think hair is getting drier every time I use it.</li>
            <li> This is this the best conditioner - put this on your hair for as many hours as you have time for - it makes your hair silky smooth and keeps color well - buy this!!!</li>
            <li> I used it twice so far. Can&#x27;t see any results. It is not doing any harm either. So I will every week add the protein step in between.</li>
            <li> I always use this on my hair before I color it and the color always turns out even and deep.  Have been using this since I heard about it years ago and buying the little bottles at Sally, I&#x27;m glad I can get a bigger bottle for a better price.</li>
