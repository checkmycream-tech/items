            <li> Not great quality, but the zipper is nice (so the pillow doesn&#x27;t fall out).  Decent value.</li>
            <li> Comfy and beautiful, just what I needed for my curly hair!</li>
            <li> I have natural hair and I have been searching for a satin pillow, so this pillow cover has been a joy to find this pretty satin pillow!&lt;br /&gt;I use it to sleep on and for decoration!</li>
            <li> Love this pillowcase. Noticed that my extensions aren&#x27;t getting matted like before, seems to be true to their word. Wasn&#x27;t a fan of the print, but got so many compliments on it, that now it&#x27;s growing on me. So happy it has a zipper and you can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
            <li> I bought this to help make my crazy morning &amp;#34;bed head&amp;#34; more manageable. I didn&#x27;t really think that a pillow case could help, but I was proven wrong. It really has made a big difference in my hair. I don&#x27;t know if its it because I toss and turn so much or what but when I would wake up my hair would just be one big rats nest. Now I am able to brush and go!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping I sleep on it lol it dose the job of protecting my hair without wearing a head wrap at night</li>
            <li> I was excited to get my pillowcase in the mail.  I washed and used it right away.  I am satisfied but not overjoyed with it.  It doesn&#x27;t feel as comfy as the satin pillowcase I had before this one.</li>
            <li> I love the way it feels on my skin and I&#x27;m happy I can just go to bed without tying my hair down, which I&#x27;m always to lazy to do.</li>
            <li> great pillow case wrinkle free after washing also love that!</li>
            <li> I have no complaints. Cute leopard print and silky to protect my hair from getting all tangled while I sleep. It&#x27;s a very generous size and has a zipper on the side. I&#x27;d recommend this. :)</li>
            <li> I only bought these as a suggestion from a friend. Glad I did, it helps keep my hair in place.</li>
            <li> I was a little bit confused on my part about the satin feel of pillows and I was thinking of soft and a little fur to it. But i was wrong, It is silky and when I sleep on it.. I just cant focus on me sleeping especially since im a side sleeper and when i breathe i just hear the movement of my head rubbing on the pillow case and its annoying. I really like the leopard case Im still going to use it once in a while.. It doesnt tangle your hair which is also nice.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t feel like real satin. Acetate? For the price it&#x27;s a pretty good pillow cover. DO like the nice looking zipper.</li>
            <li> This has been perfect as a healthier surface for my hair while I sleep. I&#x27;ve since changed my decor, though, and will be getting rid of it-- will likely be looking for another, just like it, that matches...</li>
            <li> nice, very cute, i like that it has a zipper so you can lock your pillow in there. does what its mean to do.</li>
            <li> I Love the pillow case. It is larger than a standard case. Very Nice. Will order more of these. Good quality.</li>
            <li> very smooth and does not snag like others. it has a zip enclosure and it fits the king size pillows, though barely</li>
            <li> Good price and great quality.</li>
            <li> This is a great pillow case, especially if you have naturally curly hair.  When going to bed, no need to worry what your hair will look like in the morning.  This case protects your do!</li>
            <li> Print came just like in the picture...bought to keep my hair from being pulled out fit perfect over my pillow.</li>
            <li> I really like this pillowcase! It&#x27;s comfy, makes it easy to slide my hair out from under my head, and I don&#x27;t wake up with pillowcase lines on my face anymore.</li>
            <li> Love these! It was recommended to me when my husband was experiencing hair loss from chemotherapy. The satin is gentler because is allows the hair to slide when you move. We&#x27;ve continued to use them because they feel better than anything!</li>
