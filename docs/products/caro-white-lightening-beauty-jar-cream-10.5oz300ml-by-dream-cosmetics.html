            <li>so far i love it already</li>
            <li>Saw results right away.</li>
            <li>Goes on smoothly and leaves the skin feeling very soft.</li>
            <li>But I love it, it smells nice, but the price could be a bit less, the container is kind of small for a lotion.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been able to use this for over a month and still have some left over.</li>
            <li>at first it lightened my skin like 3 shades and then it darkened me darker</li>
            <li>So it&#x27;s pretty much like a lotion.</li>
            <li>The skin tone of my thighs has significantly improved and I finally feel confident enough to wear shorts!</li>
            <li>my skin feels amazing everyday that i use it.</li>

            <li>I would recommend it because it worked really fast.</li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVE the smell of it as it does not smell like the typical skin lightening creams.</li>
            <li>Also lightened under my armpits after one use, I just put a huge glob under both armpits, slept with it on and in about a week the dark skin on my armpits started to peel off.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Caro White for 1 month and the product really works!</li>
            <li>The basic regimen plan that i have really helped with achieving the results.</li>
            <li>I would have been better off going to my local African store n buying the big jar for the same price!!</li>
            <li>, it is too thick, it is too strong for my skin,</li>
            <li>The inside seal was broken due to handling I think, but it was in good condition otherwise.</li>

            <li> , it is too thick, it is too strong for my skin,</li>
            <li> The inside seal was broken due to handling I think, but it was in good condition otherwise.</li>
            <li> My son had some black spots on his back, and the product did what it said it lightened several shades and he did not used it all the time.</li>
            <li> i just put this on my elbows because there really freaking dark ,(blk female ) and its getting-lighter , ill come bk in a week for an update</li>
            <li> Now, as for actually lightening the skin, i am not sure if it does that</li>
            <li> After I shower, I put it on my thighs, knees and elbows to lighten the dark skin.</li>
            <li> I have brightened up drastically in less than 2 months.</li>
            <li> Not good for my skin, leaves white dots on my skin so stopped using it</li>
            <li> but  may burn a little</li>
            <li> I usually use it after I go to the beach because my skin gets patches of brown spots from the sun.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually write a review</li>
            <li> If you want to use this product, at least give it 4 weeks and follow a regimen.</li>
            <li> works on my belly button scar but slowly</li>
            <li> After I used it for 4 months it made my skin DARKER seriously after like 2 minutes my face turned about 4 shades darker and stayed like that for 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> Smell is not good.</li>
            <li> I m not happy</li>
            <li> I have tried skin lightening products years ago and they all failed.</li>
            <li> /&gt;So sad</li>
            <li> I have to take a cold bath after using it..</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> it works but i do not like the smell, it is too thick, it is too strong for my skin,</li>
            <li> Product is a great moisturizing that helps light without burning or redness. Used it after show 1-2 times per day. Saw results right away.</li>
            <li> Smell is not good. I don&#x27;t like cargo white lightening cream . I m not happy</li>
            <li> work very good me love it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been able to use this for over a month and still have some left over. It doesn&#x27;t lighten, just makes your skin smooth. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend if you&#x27;re trying to lighten your skin. So it&#x27;s pretty much like a lotion. Save your money or just go buy a lotion.</li>
            <li> Works great with me &amp; smells good. Like candy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Caro White for 1 month and the product really works! After I shower, I put it on my thighs, knees and elbows to lighten the dark skin. The skin tone of my thighs has significantly improved and I finally feel confident enough to wear shorts! Knees and elbows take longer to lighten so I&#x27;m going to keep using this product and wait to see the results.</li>
            <li> I fist bought this C W Lightening a couple of months ago and posted an ok review because I didn know it was going to work. It worked for me after three to four weeks. I usually use it after I go to the beach because my skin gets patches of brown spots from the sun. It moisturize your skin and at the same time it does a nice job</li>
            <li> Not good for my skin, leaves white dots on my skin so stopped using it</li>
            <li> my skin feels amazing everyday that i use it. i will definitely be purchasing this product again. a really great buy.</li>
            <li> This  cream have a warm sensation to my skin.  I have to take a cold bath after using it.. I can&#x27;t even sleep.. The heating sensation  is unbearable. .. Is it just me alone??????</li>
            <li> I used this for a about 2 years I used the lotion and I got a lot more compliments and more dates ijs.</li>
            <li> My son had some black spots on his back, and the product did what it said it lightened several shades and he did not used it all the time. Great product. I have repurchased it for him.</li>
            <li> works on my belly button scar but slowly</li>
            <li> Love the smell, use this product on my aging arms and hands!</li>
            <li> I like the scent and the glow it gives as it moisturizes my skin however I have not seen any lightening of the skin😩</li>
            <li> Great product to use on your skin and it does the job.</li>
            <li> Even if this didn&#x27;t lighten. It sure does feel and smell AMAZING. This cream is like a soul mate to brown skin. If you put just the right amount you will have an instant, bright glow that you will be very satisfied with. Now, as for actually lightening the skin, i am not sure if it does that for I have been using this product for 4+ weeks. No significant change in skin complexion, but the product smells, feels and makes your skin look very healthy that you will forget about lightening its almost like make up! haha.</li>
            <li> really great but  may burn a little</li>
            <li> I like this product! I saw results almost instantly, but only on my face, it didn&#x27;t work on my arms or the rest of my body.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery. Love this cream and the way it feels on my skin. I broke out in a rash when I used the &amp;#34;Small Whitening Oil&amp;#34; . Relieved I didn&#x27;t break out with this cream.  Have not noticed any lightening yet.</li>
            <li> I have tried skin lightening products years ago and they all failed. My mom purchased Caro White cream for me and i absolutely love it. I started seeing results after 3 weeks. I use it every night after I take a shower. Now my skin is about 3 shades lighter. I am truly happy with my results. The basic regimen plan that i have really helped with achieving the results. It takes time and patients. If you want to use this product, at least give it 4 weeks and follow a regimen.</li>
            <li> good!!!&lt;br /&gt;i very like it...thanks</li>
            <li> It has a very strong scent! But it is a great product. Works very quickly. I have brightened up drastically in less than 2 months. Only use it once a day. Goes on smoothly and leaves the skin feeling very soft.</li>
            <li> Nice product....Will recommend...</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking to lighten, make sure you buy the oil because it works even better while using both, Great product.</li>
            <li> Good product if you wanna have a nice and glowing skin just like your favourite celebrity buy it, it works like no others cream</li>
            <li> Works wonderful I will continue to purchase this product for my husband it goes on smoothly, has a grate smell and gives even skin tone results</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as effective as the sister product. Caro light. I didn&#x27;t notice any difference in my complexion while using it. So I stopped and ordered caro white instead.</li>
            <li> I believe that this is working for me. I do not use it as often as I should (I only use it once per day) but I have noticed that my skin tone is about 2 shades lighter. I use it all over my body and I have had no side effects. I absolutely LOVE the smell of it as it does not smell like the typical skin lightening creams. I will be ordering another jar.&lt;br /&gt;The packaging could have been better. The inside seal was broken due to handling I think, but it was in good condition otherwise.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work! Have been using for a month now not a difference on my body</li>
            <li> Great products, does what it says it&#x27;ll do but overpriced! The jar is tinny. I would have been better off going to my local African store n buying the big jar for the same price!!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually write a review but I decided to write on this.  Honestly this cream works really good. U will get results within one week of using it especially when you use it 2 times a day. Good product!</li>
            <li> It only makes you lighter when you mix it with the oil. But I love it, it smells nice, but the price could be a bit less, the container is kind of small for a lotion.</li>
            <li> Nice products. I have used it for years.</li>
            <li> love how this smells and its working great so far. i use it 2x per day and i am seeing the changes. very pleased</li>
            <li> I just received this cream and tried it once.  Don&#x27;t know if it works</li>
            <li> Awesome stuff! Lightened my skin on my face probably one shade. Also lightened under my armpits after one use, I just put a huge glob under both armpits, slept with it on and in about a week the dark skin on my armpits started to peel off.</li>
            <li> After I used it for 4 months it made my skin DARKER seriously after like 2 minutes my face turned about 4 shades darker and stayed like that for 2 weeks. I threw it away..&lt;br /&gt;So sad at first it lightened my skin like 3 shades and then it darkened me darker then I was...</li>
            <li> It work very well I like it</li>
            <li> ok im so not playing i just put this on my elbows because there really freaking dark ,(blk female ) and its getting-lighter , ill come bk in a week for an update so far i love it already</li>
            <li> It Doesn&#x27;t work. Plus it Caused me to breakout in an itchy rash</li>
            <li> Did what it say it would do .But u have to use the oil also .</li>
            <li> Cleared up my melasma on my face really fast though I broke out quite a but when I started using it. I would recommend it because it worked really fast.</li>
            <li> Love the product great results.</li>
