            <li>For the price, these are amazing.  </li>
            <li>My wife liked it a lot</li>
            <li>It looks really nice</li>
            <li>it gets tangled very easily and after wearing it one time the hair started coming of</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s fine!</li>
            <li>This is actually cute and the clips hold well in very fine hair.  </li>
            <li>the Jessica Simpson bangs look a lot better</li>
            <li>It works great and gives my bangs a much needed addition.</li>
            <li>, I wish they have more or dufferents hair cuts, and the deliver</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok for a costume party.</li>
            <li>and I want to say that I&#x27;m in love with this bangs.</li>
            <li>This product in a 1b is more like a 2.</li>
            <li>I REALLY don&#x27;t have the face for bangs, so I can&#x27;t say if they look good, sturdy though.</li>
            <li>At 10 I would look for a free shipping offer only because there are SO many wonderful bang pieces out there for the same price and no shipping charges.</li>
            <li>I tried to shampoo it but it retained the shine; however, it did blow dry very nicely.</li>
            <li>I think if I can find a way to make the cut look a little more natural they&#x27;d be perfect.</li>
            <li>super plastic/fake looking as well.</li>
            <li>the hair is soft but too shiny, I will love it if the hair was more opaque like real hair.</li>
            <li>#34;this is brown&amp;#34; I put it under the light and as I thought, it is very brown!  </li>
            <li>I got the natural black shade and it looks great!</li>
            <li>it has a natural look to it, I put it on and it just looks fabulous!</li>
            <li>The only thing is that I think I need to use a headband to hide the division where the extension and real hair meet, but other than that they are perfect.</li>
            <li>The product was very affordable and came quicker than I thought it would!</li>
            <li>Looks totally real!</li>
            <li>Fast shipping!</li>
            <li>They are a little bit shiny but look way more real than any hair pieces I&#x27;ve had before, I think after a couple of washes they will have a more natural shine.</li>
            <li>Overall this is a great little piece to add to your hair</li>
            <li>this hair really sucked when I tried to comb through it</li>
            <li>Looks absolutely unnatural and very itchy</li>
            <li>I really like this product</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this to ya!</li>
            <li>The post office lost my package but the seller was nice enough to mail me another one with nm extra charge.</li>
            <li>I bought them in natural black and they are full, shiny enough without looking fake and the color matches my own hair perfectly.  </li>
            <li>so i am a woman writing this review ,anyhow this almost looks realistic</li>
            <li>I put a head band over it its actually cute a little shiny but not too shiny</li>
            <li>A little shiny but better than those ones you find in groceries stores.</li>
            <li>Also, the quality is nice as the clips are sturdy and the product is well made however, the hair is super shiny which gives a fake look.  </li>
            <li>but it is more deep brown than black</li>
            <li>I ordered the natural black and I was excited to get them!&lt;br /&gt;but</li>
            <li>I was surprised by it.  </li>
            <li>It was smooth, tangle free and wasn&#x27;t &#x27;fake shiny&#x27; at all and blends well with my natural hair.</li>
            <li>This piece is so much lighter and softer than my current bang piece.</li>
            <li>, i looks natural</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little bit darker but you can&#x27;t really tell the difference!</li>
            <li>When I wear my hair up I like to pull the long side pieces up into my hair to help it blend in and look natural.</li>

            <li> When I wear my hair up I like to pull the long side pieces up into my hair to help it blend in and look natural.</li>
            <li> Color is a little darker than I hoped (I got black), but it&#x27;s still fun to play with.</li>
            <li> Looks fake wayyy too shiny and no way to easily clip in.</li>
            <li> when they arrived they did not match my natural black hair at</li>
            <li> so I ordered the natural black.  </li>
            <li> They do look a little fake just because they are way more blunt than the one the girl is wearing.</li>
            <li> Now it does come very long in the bang area</li>
            <li> I returned not worth buying for his junk in way too long much of a giant fore head</li>
            <li> &amp; it is a little shinny for my hair type, even with my hair flat iron (mixed hair).</li>
            <li> its not super shiny either which is a big plus because I can wear it all day without people asking me if its a wig.</li>
            <li> all!&lt;br /&gt;augh now I want to dye them with black fabric dye because they look more like a dark brown instead of a really natural black color :(</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m asian with the typical dark brown/almost black hair</li>
            <li> if anything it&#x27;s bigger than small</li>
            <li> My hair is jet black and this will not work for me.  </li>
            <li> My hair color is brown black</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little tricky getting it to match your face shape</li>
            <li> I wasted my money on this one</li>
            <li> waste of money.</li>
            <li> I should have just bought another one of those I cut my other ones into Bettie Page bangs and also wanted a normal pair dont buy this hair its bad</li>
            <li> Just a little bit to thick.</li>
            <li> i mean it came off in clumps i had to throw it a way it was so poorly made</li>
            <li> this sucks!</li>
            <li> Also, you can&#x27;t tell if it&#x27;s fake.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t look fake AT ALL.</li>
            <li> it looks totally fake  </li>
            <li> it looked so fake, everyone could notice:( I decided to try X&amp;Y ANGEL&#x27;s hair extension</li>
            <li> it looks very fake</li>
            <li> disappointed</li>

    <ol>
            <li> My wife liked it a lot</li>
            <li> Took forever to get it but I do like it 😊</li>
            <li> the hair is soft but too shiny, I will love it if the hair was more opaque like real hair.</li>
            <li> this hair really sucked when I tried to comb through it a lot of the hair would fall out it looks very fake the Jessica Simpson bangs look a lot better I should have just bought another one of those I cut my other ones into Bettie Page bangs and also wanted a normal pair dont buy this hair its bad</li>
            <li> my husband ordered me this im on his account now lol so i am a woman writing this review ,anyhow this almost looks realistic I put a head band over it its actually cute a little shiny but not too shiny</li>
            <li> Dont look as pictured</li>
            <li> Was not the hair piece when I got it, it look different</li>
            <li> I bought this because I didn&#x27;t want to cut my bangs and they were great! I wore it in public and no one noticed they were clip ons! There a bit shiny and the color was a bit different from mine but that&#x27;s fine!</li>
            <li> This is actually cute and the clips hold well in very fine hair.  I was surprised by it.  Now it does come very long in the bang area so if you are looking for bangs above the brow just know you will need to trim this up.  Overall this is a great little piece to add to your hair collection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I paid 1.99 plus shipping from X &amp; Y Angel. I value this at anywhere from 5 to 10 range.  At 10 I would look for a free shipping offer only because there are SO many wonderful bang pieces out there for the same price and no shipping charges.</li>
            <li> I got the natural black shade and it looks great! I&#x27;m asian with the typical dark brown/almost black hair and it matched perfectly. It was smooth, tangle free and wasn&#x27;t &#x27;fake shiny&#x27; at all and blends well with my natural hair. It&#x27;s a little tricky getting it to match your face shape and I had to trim mine a bit but that&#x27;s not a problem at all, we all have different face shapes! Very happy with the purchase not to mention that the shipping was incredibly fast!</li>
            <li> Looks absolutely unnatural and very itchy I wasted my money on this one</li>
            <li> LOVE this hairpiece! It works great and gives my bangs a much needed addition. The product was very affordable and came quicker than I thought it would! Very nice product!</li>
            <li> These work great.had to trim it.</li>
            <li> This piece is so much lighter and softer than my current bang piece. They do look a little fake just because they are way more blunt than the one the girl is wearing. I think if I can find a way to make the cut look a little more natural they&#x27;d be perfect. When I wear my hair up I like to pull the long side pieces up into my hair to help it blend in and look natural. They are a little bit shiny but look way more real than any hair pieces I&#x27;ve had before, I think after a couple of washes they will have a more natural shine.</li>
            <li> I really like this product, i looks natural And i like the Hair cut, I wish they have more or dufferents hair cuts, and the deliver it was awesome, I defenely recomend this product and seller</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok for a costume party. You get what you pay for. A little shiny but better than those ones you find in groceries stores.</li>
            <li> I just receive my delivered 2 days ago and I want to say that I&#x27;m in love with this bangs. They are easy to put them on and perfect for any occasion. I don&#x27;t have too cut my hair court anymore. And the shipping was faster that I was expecting it.</li>
            <li> It looks great on my wife. It&#x27;s a little bit darker but you can&#x27;t really tell the difference! Also, you can&#x27;t tell if it&#x27;s fake. Looks totally real! I would highly recommend this to ya!</li>
            <li> Product as described. Fast shipping! Color is a little darker than I hoped (I got black), but it&#x27;s still fun to play with. Looks passable if I wear a knit cap.</li>
            <li> I had ordered a clip extension from another seller and it was horrendous! it looked so fake, everyone could notice:( I decided to try X&amp;Y ANGEL&#x27;s hair extension and I am so happy I did! This doesn&#x27;t look fake AT ALL. it has a natural look to it, I put it on and it just looks fabulous! its not super shiny either which is a big plus because I can wear it all day without people asking me if its a wig. I recommend it 100%!</li>
            <li> I REALLY don&#x27;t have the face for bangs, so I can&#x27;t say if they look good, sturdy though. All in all, a good product... probably.</li>
            <li> Looks fake wayyy too shiny and no way to easily clip in.</li>
            <li> I ordered the natural black and I was excited to get them!&lt;br /&gt;but when they arrived they did not match my natural black hair at all!&lt;br /&gt;augh now I want to dye them with black fabric dye because they look more like a dark brown instead of a really natural black color :( disappointed</li>
            <li> For the price, these are amazing.  I bought them in natural black and they are full, shiny enough without looking fake and the color matches my own hair perfectly.  The only thing is that I think I need to use a headband to hide the division where the extension and real hair meet, but other than that they are perfect.</li>
            <li> waste of money. Does not even clip</li>
            <li> This product in a 1b is more like a 2. The minute that I took it out of the bag, I started frowning and thinking to myself that &amp;#34;this is brown&amp;#34; I put it under the light and as I thought, it is very brown!  My hair is jet black and this will not work for me.  Also, the quality is nice as the clips are sturdy and the product is well made however, the hair is super shiny which gives a fake look.  I will stick with  the more expensive human hair bangs.  You get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> this sucks! do not get it, looks like a mob of hair! super plastic/fake looking as well.</li>
            <li> I returned not worth buying for his junk in way too long much of a giant fore head it&#x27;s not gonna work for you mines meeting if anything it&#x27;s bigger than small so if it&#x27;s too big for me for you you have to put it all the way back today at partier head LOL</li>
            <li> it looks totally fake  it gets tangled very easily and after wearing it one time the hair started coming of i mean it came off in clumps i had to throw it a way it was so poorly made</li>
            <li> Good quality.  Just a little bit to thick.</li>
            <li> The seller was great. The post office lost my package but the seller was nice enough to mail me another one with nm extra charge. My hair color is brown black so I ordered the natural black.  It looks really nice but it is more deep brown than black &amp; it is a little shinny for my hair type, even with my hair flat iron (mixed hair). I tried to shampoo it but it retained the shine; however, it did blow dry very nicely.</li>
