            <li>Excelent, for face better.</li>
            <li>There are so many positives to using this suncreen&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so I thought in a pinch it would be OK for my kids.</li>
            <li>My kids love this for their faces.</li>
            <li>LOVE this product.</li>
            <li>I found the fragrance to be MOST OBNOXIOUS.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff and keep it in my purse for the kids and even myself.  </li>
            <li>She seems to be applying this with better coverage.</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly and its very easy to apply</li>
            <li>Easy to carry, the kids don&#x27;t mind it as much as spray on or liquid, so it is great.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t think these are authentic as authentic product is tear free.  </li>
            <li>She can put this on herself as it easily glides.</li>
            <li>but this was so easy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not greasy at all and easy to apply.</li>
            <li>This goes on clear, smells pleasant, and isnt goopy at all.</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth and doesn&#x27;t skip.  </li>
            <li>Fabulous for putting on the kids.  </li>
            <li>Product works great, but if you check the ingredient list, you will stay away because of the potential health effects.  </li>
            <li>My daughter has sensitive fair skin.</li>
            <li>We use it only for faces, it smells very nice and is not sticky at all.</li>
            <li>Original product is fabulous, but these are not.  </li>
            <li>I am 54 and use this for my face for a quick youth up of sunscreen.</li>
            <li>Normally we use Adorable baby or California baby but were not home.</li>
            <li>My 2yr old says it tickles :)  </li>
            <li>It is exactly what i was looking for.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great to not have to mess around with globs of lotion around the eyes especially.</li>
            <li>She swims with it in and it stays...it works very well.</li>
            <li>Hurts baby&#x27;s eyes but rubs in really well.  </li>
            <li>Thanks Neutrogena.</li>
            <li>Now, I know other children may be OK with it but just wanted to warn that there is a possibility for a rash.</li>
            <li>Small handy sunblock.  </li>
            <li>easy to apply and doesn&#x27;t drip in their eyes when wet.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy for my kids to apply themselves AND goes on over wet skin.</li>
            <li>I mainly use it on their faces.</li>
            <li>I put it on to try it out and was surprised by how much fragrance it had.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just glad neither of us have messy hands and clothes.  </li>
            <li>We have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I love how convenient this small stick is.  </li>
            <li>I can get my 4 year old to put sunscreen on.  </li>
            <li>My five-year-old can do it entirely by himself, and my two-year-old can try, haha.</li>
            <li>so i could put a light layer on my 5 year old everyday before she goes to school.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s such an easy little sunscreen to apply to the child&#x27;s face.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not unpleasant, but as someone sensitive to smells, after just a few minutes I had to wash it off my face because it gave me a headache.  </li>
            <li>It works well, but I couldn&#x27;t help but notice that this has exactly the same Active Ingredients (in the same percentages) as [[ASIN:B00HNSSV3U Neutrogena Sunscreen Ultra Sheer Stick SPF 70]], which includes 3x more (1.5oz vs 0.47oz), for roughly the same price.</li>
            <li>but apparently they discontinued this.  </li>
            <li>On a scale 1 (good) to 10 (bad) of potential health effects, the product is rated 7.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> my husband has very sensitive skin, and Neutrogena has never let us down.  </li>
            <li> So much easier to apply than messy sunscreen!  </li>
            <li> Given our sensitive skin and another review, I was a little worried, but we had no problems.  </li>
            <li> Be careful with the Oxybenzone (3%) in this sunscreen, especially for girl!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Some if the other sticks leave a white residue</li>
            <li> We always apply it on dry skin, then have the kids re-apply every hour while at the beach.</li>
            <li> Spent 2 hours while away in the Caribbean at the clinic getting them checked out.</li>
            <li> As a side note, it is also greasier than I would have expected it to be.  </li>
            <li> Bummed that I spent $6 and have to try something else.</li>
            <li> even if you get wet, eyes dont itch or get irritated</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried to apply it when he&#x27;s been wet</li>
            <li> We started using the Neutrogena sun screens a few years back at the recommendation of a tennis coach.</li>
            <li> It does not cause her to break out as other sunblocks have.</li>
            <li> We use the other Neutrogena sun screen products and tried this stick for my daughter (10) to apply herself for her face at swim practice and at meets.  </li>
            <li> Wrong.</li>
            <li> Received a bad product quality and safety review largely due to nasty ingredients.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe people put this toxic product on their children, it must be making them sick.</li>
            <li> I hate putting SS on faces with Spray or lotion</li>
            <li> Gave me a very bad headache.</li>
            <li> This is terrible because if you put it on your lips, it causes a pain in your mouth.  </li>
            <li> Neutrogena suncreens are among the worst on the market for sun protection as well as harmful toxic chemicals.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> We love this sunscreen. We use it only for faces, it smells very nice and is not sticky at all. The kids actually don&#x27;t mind when I pull this out to use on their faces! They love the smell and always comment how &amp;#34;lovely&amp;#34; it smells.</li>
            <li> Received a bad product quality and safety review largely due to nasty ingredients.  [...]</li>
            <li> a excellent product for the care of the skin</li>
            <li> I got this to replace Neutrogena Oil-Free Sunblock Stick, SPF 30, which was great, but now discontinued.  This is terrible because if you put it on your lips, it causes a pain in your mouth.  It&#x27;s toxic.  The directions say \\&quot;For external use only, do not swallow, or get in your eyes.\\&quot;  I have to throw away the four sticks I bought from Amazon.  There goes $28.</li>
            <li> Much smaller size than anticipated for the price!</li>
            <li> It works well, but I couldn&#x27;t help but notice that this has exactly the same Active Ingredients (in the same percentages) as [[ASIN:B00HNSSV3U Neutrogena Sunscreen Ultra Sheer Stick SPF 70]], which includes 3x more (1.5oz vs 0.47oz), for roughly the same price. The smaller size of this product makes it easier to apply around kids&#x27; eyes, but otherwise I&#x27;ll be using the regular/larger/cheaper Ultra Sheer Stick for larger areas.</li>
            <li> BEWARE!  Neutrogena suncreens are among the worst on the market for sun protection as well as harmful toxic chemicals.  I used to use this until I read this: http://www.medicaldaily.com/ewgs-sunscreen-guide-outs-brands-false-protection-claims-which-can-you-trust-334248</li>
            <li> Very good product for the kids</li>
            <li> Product expires in 3 months.  Original product is fabulous, but these are not.  Don&#x27;t think these are authentic as authentic product is tear free.  These made my daughters&#x27; eyes irritated, swollen, and runny.  Spent 2 hours while away in the Caribbean at the clinic getting them checked out.</li>
            <li> I love how convenient this small stick is.  It&#x27;s the one and only way I can get my 4 year old to put sunscreen on.  And it works!  I would definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li> I got this for an upcoming trip - my husband has very sensitive skin, and Neutrogena has never let us down.  I put it on to try it out and was surprised by how much fragrance it had.  It&#x27;s not unpleasant, but as someone sensitive to smells, after just a few minutes I had to wash it off my face because it gave me a headache.  As a side note, it is also greasier than I would have expected it to be.  Bummed that I spent $6 and have to try something else.</li>
            <li> Best product for kids. My five-year-old can do it entirely by himself, and my two-year-old can try, haha. It&#x27;s great to not have to mess around with globs of lotion around the eyes especially.</li>
            <li> FUSS FREE! Just the sunscreen for moms with kids who can&#x27;t wait to get into the pool!</li>
            <li> The best sunscreen for face.  This is the only face sunscreen my kids want to use.  It goes on smooth and doesn&#x27;t skip.  It doesn&#x27;t make them tear up.  Plus it&#x27;s perfect size for the face.</li>
            <li> Small handy sunblock.  Smells good too</li>
            <li> My daughter has sensitive fair skin. She can put this on herself as it easily glides. It does not cause her to break out as other sunblocks have. She is protected from sunburns and allergic reactions. She swims with it in and it stays...it works very well.</li>
            <li> The sunblock stick is easy for my daughter to put on her cheeks and nose at camp!</li>
            <li> I am 54 and use this for my face for a quick youth up of sunscreen. I have been using it for two years now and it&#x27;s perfect for your face..it also works as a great primer that helps smooth your skin for your foundation..</li>
            <li> A friend of mine was using this on her kids face and I was like &amp;#34;what is that&amp;#34;??? I hate putting SS on faces with Spray or lotion but this was so easy. A+++!!</li>
            <li> This is the best product on market. We are out on the river for hours and no burn. You can reapply by just drying  your face! The spray works great too</li>
            <li> great for kids!  easy to apply and doesn&#x27;t drip in their eyes when wet.  I mainly use it on their faces.</li>
            <li> Fabulous for putting on the kids.  Easy to apply and does not get in eyes!</li>
            <li> Excelent, for face better.</li>
            <li> There are so many positives to using this suncreen&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. It goes on smoothly and its very easy to apply&lt;br /&gt;2. it leaves no residue or white coat, becomes invisible... yipee!! no ghost children!&lt;br /&gt;3. even if you get wet, eyes dont itch or get irritated&lt;br /&gt;4. it has a nice smell</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this stuff!!  So convenient and use it on my face/neck all the time</li>
            <li> FINALLY, sunscreen that doesn&#x27;t get all over your fingers or spray all over the place!</li>
            <li> Hurts baby&#x27;s eyes but rubs in really well.  No sunburn after swimming for hours in Mexico with sand and towels</li>
            <li> Great price for a great product. Best sunscreen ever!!!!!! Bought 10 of them. Will recommend to every parent. Thank you!!!!</li>
            <li> Goes on well. We use it on the kids at the beach or pool.</li>
            <li> Product works great, but if you check the ingredient list, you will stay away because of the potential health effects.  On a scale 1 (good) to 10 (bad) of potential health effects, the product is rated 7.  Rating provided by an independent organization that focus on sunscreen review/analysis.  I threw away the two I bought, and switched to a product rated 1.</li>
            <li> I had to order this online bc I can no longer find it in the stores. It&#x27;s such an easy little sunscreen to apply to the child&#x27;s face. I bought 2 bc I didn&#x27;t want to lose it. I keep one in my purse and one in the pool bag.</li>
            <li> Normally we use Adorable baby or California baby but were not home. I purchased this because I use Neutragena products so I thought in a pinch it would be OK for my kids. Wrong. Now, I know other children may be OK with it but just wanted to warn that there is a possibility for a rash. My kids 4 &amp; 8 ended up with a 3 day rash on their faces where I put the product. Just a heads up.</li>
            <li> My kids love this for their faces. It never gets in their eyes. So many make them cry and they refuse to wear them--total win for summer!</li>
            <li> We have very sensitive skin and this has worked great for us.  We took it on vacation, no chance for spill and works wonderfully.  We used to use \\&quot;Neutrogena Oil-Free Sunblock Stick, SPF 30\\&quot; but apparently they discontinued this.  Given our sensitive skin and another review, I was a little worried, but we had no problems.  Easy to carry, the kids don&#x27;t mind it as much as spray on or liquid, so it is great.  Recommend it!  We also put one in the kids backpack to reapply at school.</li>
            <li> LOVE this product. It&#x27;s easy for my kids to apply themselves AND goes on over wet skin. We always apply it on dry skin, then have the kids re-apply every hour while at the beach. We have not had any sunburns this summer.</li>
            <li> I found the fragrance to be MOST OBNOXIOUS. Gave me a very bad headache. I had to wash my face several times to get it off. I can&#x27;t believe people put this toxic product on their children, it must be making them sick.</li>
            <li> So much easier to apply than messy sunscreen!  My 2yr old says it tickles :)  I&#x27;m just glad neither of us have messy hands and clothes.  It&#x27;s a great portable size and you don&#x27;t have to worry about it leaking in your bag.  He&#x27;s never had a sun burn when we&#x27;ve used it either.  I haven&#x27;t tried to apply it when he&#x27;s been wet but I don&#x27;t see how it wouldn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff and keep it in my purse for the kids and even myself.  The lid stays on and since it&#x27;s a solid I don&#x27;t worry about it squirting out.  It is just the right size and develops the perfect curve for applying under your eyes on the top of your cheeks where kids are sunburn prone.  I use it all over their faces and ears.</li>
            <li> Be careful with the Oxybenzone (3%) in this sunscreen, especially for girl!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oxybenzone can act like estrogen in the body and alter sperm production in animals. It&#x27;s also associated with endometriosis in women.</li>
            <li> This is the only sunblock I will use on mine it my kids faces. It&#x27;s not greasy at all and easy to apply. Some if the other sticks leave a white residue but this doesn&#x27;t</li>
            <li> Good quality good packaging good product in a stick.  My kids only like stick sunscreen and this does the trick. Thanks Neutrogena.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen is great. I bought it so i could put a light layer on my 5 year old everyday before she goes to school. This goes on clear, smells pleasant, and isnt goopy at all. It is exactly what i was looking for.</li>
            <li> We use the other Neutrogena sun screen products and tried this stick for my daughter (10) to apply herself for her face at swim practice and at meets.  We started using the Neutrogena sun screens a few years back at the recommendation of a tennis coach. My daughter likes this stick version because she says she can apply it close to her eyes where her goggles don&#x27;t cover without getting sunscreen in her eyes. I&#x27;m happy with it because she uses it more often because it is so easy to apply. With the cream sunscreen she would have uncovered sections of her face that would get burned. She seems to be applying this with better coverage.</li>
