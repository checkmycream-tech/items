            <li>At first I though that this was a great purchase, good price and nice product</li>

            <li>Amazon has great prices and quick delivery....</li>
            <li>I think this product was very cheap on amazon</li>
            <li>I use the 5% for the eye area...and the 15% for my face, it&#x27;s an amazing product, I see a huge difference in my skin.  </li>
            <li>This is one of my favorite products.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>my husband and myself use all Obagi products and we love them....</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>Recommended by dermatologist and love it.</li>
            <li>Another month I should really be able to tell...</li>
            <li>Love this product and have been using it for years.</li>
            <li>I read some reviews of people saying that this product is not the authentic one</li>
            <li>Obagi is interesting.</li>
            <li>Some of their products, I love.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>But in this supplier i got the best and low price.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite product of the 3 I bought because it feels like it is closing up the wrinkles and tightening the skin.</li>
            <li>Love the results.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product for more than 10 years.</li>
            <li>As to the 5% solution, I would suggest NOT USING the dropper because it puts out more than you need.</li>
            <li>which is probably a year supply or more.</li>
            <li>Many outlets suggest a vitC cream for eyes and some of the benefits will take many months to see</li>
            <li>Love this eye serum.  </li>
            <li>It is very smooth and goes on easily.  </li>
            <li>and so far is working great with me.</li>
            <li>I got this after reading such good reviews with a lot of hope for my pigmentation - been using it for almost a month but yet to see any noticeable results!</li>
            <li>My wife has beautiful skin and looks a dozen years younger than she is.  </li>
            <li>I was looking for help with undereye circles, and fine lines.</li>
            <li>I have a noticeable reduction in redness, and fine lines.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I will now switch over to obagi after so many years of being loyal to dermologica.</li>
            <li>my skin looks and feels amazing.....very clear and bright....</li>
            <li>This product is GREAT, I had skin tightening under my eyes which brused and left stains.  </li>
            <li>and I have light radiant eyes....</li>
            <li>This supplier I found it more economical.</li>
            <li>It is meant to even skin tone and smooth the surface.  </li>
            <li>It is the genuine Obagi that I have been using.</li>
            <li>I have paid $125.00 for chemical peels that didn&#x27;t do as much peeling as this did!!!</li>
            <li>I was looking for something to help with the fine lines that have appeared under my eyes, I have used many products, but this is the first time I&#x27;ve seen results.  </li>
            <li>Was so excited to find this product....</li>
            <li>This is a great eye cream which helps with fine lines as well as dark circles.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t feel any tingle when I put it on, so I am not even sure if it was the real deal.</li>
            <li>but then I ordered one more time and its just look like water or to much water on it</li>
            <li>I started using this after going through a full bottle of elastiderm.  </li>
            <li>I store it in a cool area and it hasn&#x27;t discolored.  </li>
            <li>This product arrived quickly and sealed.</li>
            <li>Absorbs quickly and keeps skin hydrated and helps with discoloration.  </li>
            <li>Cap has a built in dropper which is nice but releases much more than actually needed.&lt;br /&gt;Product: I use this product under my normal eye cream.</li>
            <li>Advise to keep in cool dark place, the refrigerator is good, and keep cap tightened.</li>
            <li>absolutely loved the obargi 15%, it just sinks into my skin, @ it feels so nice afterwards, so smooth, @ nice,,,, i use it every single day, never miss, as it is a big part of my beauty rountine, dont know what i would do without it, to be honest, i would be totally lost, obargi serum gets into the derma layers of your skin, so long term</li>
            <li>THIS WAS WONDERFUL, I saw the staines diminishing from the first few days, 1 month later they where virtually gone and now 2 months they are gone</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m thinking to purchase this product from some the place where I first saw it</li>
            <li>and that&#x27;s more than enough.</li>
            <li>First of all, this is NOT a moisturizer.</li>
            <li>this makes you more likely to burn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great price for the product and should last a very long time.</li>
            <li>Finally, it takes a good solid month of use to see results.  </li>
            <li>I ordered the first bottle of this because I needed an eye treatment, it was obagi and it was cheap enough.</li>
            <li>It really diminishes the lines under my eyes.</li>
            <li>very soothing</li>
            <li>I am AA amd got really hyperpigmented lids from using lilash and latisse .</li>
            <li>really don&#x27;t have any skin issues but see a differance in my skin after using this product.</li>
            <li>and I really like.</li>
            <li>Takes about a week to see but really works.</li>
            <li>A fresh bottle starts out clear.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed much of anything yet, after about a month.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know, because I do realize vit-c products are time sensitive, light sensitive, etc.</li>
            <li>Perhaps that&#x27;s because I am more diligent about using it and do use it twice a day now with the other OBAGI products.</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m becoming to a conclusion that this product it&#x27;s been diluted with some other liquid that it&#x27;s not what the real Obagi claims to be.</li>
            <li>It is better than many expensive eye creams that I have bought over the years.</li>
            <li>I would always recommend all Obagi products, only make sure that when you order any these  products, they arrive properly  sealed.</li>
            <li>I like all the OBAGI system products but stick with the Nu Derm system and just add the C serums to that particular regime.    </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think I have used the product long enough to really say I love it, but I think it&#x27;s making an improvement in my skin.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend</li>
            <li>results show within days, highly recommend</li>
            <li>and it really works though I have no dark circles</li>
            <li>I feel like the skin around my eyes is more hydrated and small lines under my eyes have improved since switching to this product about a month ago.  </li>
            <li>I apply first before my daily moisturizer.</li>
            <li>These are the exact same thing, at half the cost, and the business ships super fast.</li>
            <li>And the skin under my eyes became rough and more dry, irritated.  </li>
            <li>The dropper is all white and OBAGI droppers always have a black top.</li>
            <li>It was gentle enough, does not flare my skin (applied twice weekly).</li>
            <li>In any case, I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin, that&#x27;s why I started with the 5%.</li>
            <li>Maybe it&#x27;s too early to judge</li>
            <li>Since I have been using Obagi for over a year, here lately I have received more compliments on my skin.....</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>If it is amber when you get it, it is old.  </li>
            <li>Although NOTHING prevents wrinkles, this product does&lt;br /&gt;help maintain your skin around your eye area that is so sensitive.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and had no issues.  </li>
            <li>I have not used this product enough to give it any type of decent rating.</li>
            <li>So upset right now, as I just opened the package and it is clearly not real OBAGI!</li>
            <li>The skin begins to look dull and darkens when it doesn&#x27;t get enough nutrients so this will work even better if taken with</li>
            <li>The 5% solution is for around your eyes and the other higher % solutions are for your face and neck area.</li>
            <li>A bit drying at first, so I&#x27;ve decided to use every other day.</li>
            <li>Looking for something else which would help more than this serum and without drying and irritating my skin.</li>
            <li>Along with the other products by Obagi my skin has improved much.</li>

            <li> I feel like the skin around my eyes is more hydrated and small lines under my eyes have improved since switching to this product about a month ago.  </li>
            <li> I apply first before my daily moisturizer.</li>
            <li> These are the exact same thing, at half the cost, and the business ships super fast.</li>
            <li> And the skin under my eyes became rough and more dry, irritated.  </li>
            <li> The dropper is all white and OBAGI droppers always have a black top.</li>
            <li> It was gentle enough, does not flare my skin (applied twice weekly).</li>
            <li> In any case, I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin, that&#x27;s why I started with the 5%.</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s too early to judge</li>
            <li> Since I have been using Obagi for over a year, here lately I have received more compliments on my skin.....</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> If it is amber when you get it, it is old.  </li>
            <li> Although NOTHING prevents wrinkles, this product does&lt;br /&gt;help maintain your skin around your eye area that is so sensitive.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and had no issues.  </li>
            <li> I have not used this product enough to give it any type of decent rating.</li>
            <li> So upset right now, as I just opened the package and it is clearly not real OBAGI!</li>
            <li> The skin begins to look dull and darkens when it doesn&#x27;t get enough nutrients so this will work even better if taken with</li>
            <li> The 5% solution is for around your eyes and the other higher % solutions are for your face and neck area.</li>
            <li> A bit drying at first, so I&#x27;ve decided to use every other day.</li>
            <li> Looking for something else which would help more than this serum and without drying and irritating my skin.</li>
            <li> Along with the other products by Obagi my skin has improved much.</li>
            <li> I am 55 and have had several clients (much younger than I), ask what I was using because my face looked so firm and soft.</li>
            <li> One thing I have found however regarding the 20% solution (NOT the 5%)  is that it doesn&#x27;t last me as long as it used to.</li>
            <li> Been  using it for  just 3 weeks and major diff , I only need a little concealer now</li>
            <li> I am not sure if I would recommend this product as a solution to lines and wrinkles around the eyes, but I do highly recommend it to alleviate morning puffiness.</li>
            <li> but I least I will know that it&#x27;s the real thing.</li>
            <li> My face feels soft and firm</li>
            <li> Can finally get rid of all my other eye product.</li>
            <li> I was bumed that this did not work for me it dry my skin around my eyes,threw it away wast of money,if I could</li>
            <li> I have dry skin</li>
            <li> I do see a difference, my eye cream helps with the dry feeling, so that&#x27;s not an issue.</li>
            <li> My main complaint that for under my eyes I would prefer to use a cream rather than a liquid.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry that I ever paid full price.  </li>
            <li> Very \\&quot;oily\\&quot; not ideal to use prior to makeup</li>
            <li> While certainly not cheap, I have to admit a 1/2 oz bottle will last a very long time.</li>
            <li> , obargi products---- a little expensive, but to me worth every penny, i will definitely keep on buying it,</li>
            <li> Be careful not to get it into the eyes because it stings.  </li>
            <li> I just place my finger over the bottle opening, tip the bottle to wet the finger</li>
            <li> I will continue to use this and am going to order 20% serum also for other areas of my face.</li>
            <li> But due to the price of all the Obagi products I have ordered the 20% solution from another vendor which is ½ the price.    </li>
            <li> keeps the area under my eyes moist and I feel it has made a difference in my dark circles.</li>
            <li> This preparation also faded the dark circles under my eyes.</li>
            <li> To me its not worth the money.</li>
            <li> I do not know if it helps with dark circles.  </li>
            <li> but that could be because I am less anemic (taking iron supplements) though it could also be from this.</li>
            <li> I guess my dark circles do seem a little less</li>
            <li> I figure this small bottle will last at least another 6 months at this rate.</li>
            <li> For 2 weeks now, I&#x27;ve been using this Vit C eye serum together with another eye products, with little improvement.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s helped slow down crows feet and sagging eyelid.</li>
            <li> I usually like Obagi products.</li>
            <li> I used it in the past</li>
            <li> I am not sure if I&#x27;ll buy again, depends on if I see any changes between now and end of my bottle.</li>
            <li> I paid for it and now it&#x27;s too late to return</li>
            <li> I use the 20% solution for my face, but led up to that slowly.</li>
            <li> I have now done at least 5 peels out of this little bottle and there is still some in the bottle!!!</li>
            <li> By ordering online the products are much less expensive.</li>
            <li> that I have not loved.  </li>
            <li> This one - not very impressed.</li>
            <li> She claims the Obagi products are the secret.  </li>
            <li> hiya, sorry about late reply.  </li>
            <li> It also smells Horrible, and real OBAGI has never ever smelled like this.</li>
            <li> hardly need any foundation!!</li>
            <li> fail...</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> My plastic surgeon introduced me to Obagi.  This is one of my favorite products.  It really diminishes the lines under my eyes.</li>
            <li> great product and quick delivery. I love this stuff. It is better than many expensive eye creams that I have bought over the years. I could see a difference in skin pigmentation and wrinkles in a couple of weeks.</li>
            <li> Perfect for around my eyes.</li>
            <li> I was bumed that this did not work for me it dry my skin around my eyes,threw it away wast of money,if I could I would give it 0 stars</li>
            <li> My wife has beautiful skin and looks a dozen years younger than she is.  She claims the Obagi products are the secret.  She used to buy them from a salon at twice the price.  These are the exact same thing, at half the cost, and the business ships super fast.</li>
            <li> This product does diminish the morning puffy eyes.  Be careful not to get it into the eyes because it stings.  I am not sure if I would recommend this product as a solution to lines and wrinkles around the eyes, but I do highly recommend it to alleviate morning puffiness.</li>
            <li> Packaging and delivery: This product arrived quickly and sealed. Cap has a built in dropper which is nice but releases much more than actually needed.&lt;br /&gt;Product: I use this product under my normal eye cream. It works well as a collagen builder and \\&quot;brightener\\&quot;. It is not a moisturizer and will not moisturize like a cream. The skin begins to look dull and darkens when it doesn&#x27;t get enough nutrients so this will work even better if taken with vitamin c tablets. Great price for the product and should last a very long time. Advise to keep in cool dark place, the refrigerator is good, and keep cap tightened.</li>
            <li> I actually never ordered this.</li>
            <li> I use this every morning under my eyes....very soothing and it really works though I have no dark circles..I see a nice difference..my husband and myself use all Obagi products and we love them....great savings going to Amazon rather than our skin care Dr.....my skin looks and feels amazing.....very clear and bright....hardly need any foundation!! A must have!</li>
            <li> This product was sealed and boxed nicely, which I am happy about.  I bought this along with the 15% face serum.  I love this stuff.  My face feels soft and firm and I noticed a difference immediately.  I have dry skin and this feels great. I am 55 and have had several clients (much younger than I), ask what I was using because my face looked so firm and soft.</li>
            <li> I could tell a definite improvement in the area around my eyes after only a couple of weeks of use. My daughter even noticed it and she did not know I was using this product. I will continue to use this and am going to order 20% serum also for other areas of my face. Great product for the money!!</li>
            <li> Consistency is great, it is moisturizing and the price was great. The only Vitamin C I will use around my eyes and eyelids. Great purchase:)</li>
            <li> I usually like Obagi products. I ordered the first bottle of this because I needed an eye treatment, it was obagi and it was cheap enough. I like it and ordered a second bottle. keeps the area under my eyes moist and I feel it has made a difference in my dark circles.</li>
            <li> Vitamin C is one of the only molecules that will actually penetrate deep layers of the skin, and there is plenty of science to demonstrate that it actually repairs cells. This preparation also faded the dark circles under my eyes. I got brave &amp; tried it on my Roeace-troubled areas. It was gentle enough, does not flare my skin (applied twice weekly). Also use on my lips, they stay moisturized all day. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Great eye solution for keeping the years at bay. Great price.  Recommended by dermatologist and love it. Can finally get rid of all my other eye product.</li>
            <li> This product is GREAT, I had skin tightening under my eyes which brused and left stains.  I panicked am my surgeon told me to use a skin lightning product to remove the staines.  I reasserted on the effectiveness and harshness (its for under the eyes) I got this from Obagi I had used their products before.... THIS WAS WONDERFUL, I saw the staines diminishing from the first few days, 1 month later they where virtually gone and now 2 months they are gone and I have light radiant eyes.... I will not stop using this product it did what it said, and some!!! Thank you OBAGI</li>
            <li> like it .. for moisture at night .</li>
            <li> Somehow I missed that this dispenses with a dropper. Because of this, I don&#x27;t use it as often as I should. Had I known it dispensed with a dropper I might not have bought it. In any case, I have sensitive skin and it does not irritate me, but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve used it often enough to determine if it works or not.</li>
            <li> This stuff reaaly works. I have sensitive skin, that&#x27;s why I started with the 5%. It took 2 bottles . . . but it works!!!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I have used the product long enough to really say I love it, but I think it&#x27;s making an improvement in my skin.  Another month I should really be able to tell...</li>
            <li> Love this product and have been using it for years. I would always recommend all Obagi products, only make sure that when you order any these  products, they arrive properly  sealed.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for about 3 weeks now and have noticed no change. I didn&#x27;t feel any tingle when I put it on, so I am not even sure if it was the real deal. I will continue to use it for a couple weeks, but if I notice no difference, then I am done with it.</li>
            <li> Todays is the 6th day since I started using it and I don&#x27;t see any visible changes, wrinkles are still there. Maybe it&#x27;s too early to judge but as some people wrote it worked for them almost instantly. And the skin under my eyes became rough and more dry, irritated.  Looking for something else which would help more than this serum and without drying and irritating my skin.</li>
            <li> At first I though that this was a great purchase, good price and nice product but then I ordered one more time and its just look like water or to much water on it, I&#x27;m becoming to a conclusion that this product it&#x27;s been diluted with some other liquid that it&#x27;s not what the real Obagi claims to be. I guess the price says at all!! I read some reviews of people saying that this product is not the authentic one and now I&#x27;m agreed with them. I&#x27;m thinking to purchase this product from some the place where I first saw it so I can compare between them will be more expensive but I least I will know that it&#x27;s the real thing.</li>
            <li> I am AA amd got really hyperpigmented lids from using lilash and latisse . Been  using it for  just 3 weeks and major diff , I only need a little concealer now</li>
            <li> I have the rest of the Obagi Rx-C products and it has made a great difference.  But I was noticing that around my eyes it was not working.  I can already tell a difference using the eye serum.</li>
            <li> I use the 5% for the eye area...and the 15% for my face, it&#x27;s an amazing product, I see a huge difference in my skin.  I&#x27;ve been using these products for a year now.  Amazon has great prices and quick delivery....I&#x27;m a customer for life.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for one week and I can not believe the difference it has made to my eyes.</li>
            <li> I started using this after going through a full bottle of elastiderm.  I feel like the skin around my eyes is more hydrated and small lines under my eyes have improved since switching to this product about a month ago.  I still use the elasiderm around my lips.</li>
            <li> After several months of use, you can kiss Botox goodbye.  It&#x27;s amazing!</li>
            <li> Hi,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really don&#x27;t have any skin issues but see a differance in my skin after using this product. The serum rocks and I use it everywhere!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will now switch over to obagi after so many years of being loyal to dermologica.</li>
            <li> Even though its 5% it still irritates the outer corner of my eye area. Will not purchase again. To me its not worth the money. Very \\&quot;oily\\&quot; not ideal to use prior to makeup</li>
            <li> Obagi is interesting. Some of their products, I love. Some of them, I don&#x27;t see any results. This one - not very impressed. I&#x27;m white/mid 30s/female. I was looking for help with undereye circles, and fine lines. Didn&#x27;t see much/any difference. Maybe I got a dud? I don&#x27;t know, because I do realize vit-c products are time sensitive, light sensitive, etc. But for the price, won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> Best eye serum ever.  Since I have been using Obagi for over a year, here lately I have received more compliments on my skin.....and I turned 50 this year!!</li>
            <li> Love this product. I wear it at night only over more expensive eye cream.&lt;br /&gt;Extra moisture feels good to my skin. It&#x27;s helped slow down crows feet and sagging eyelid.</li>
            <li> I used it in the past and I really like. This supplier I found it more economical. It is a product that every woman must have in our house.</li>
            <li> I use this over my entire face and find it makes a noticeable improvement to how my skin looks, feels and endures the weather. Reduces skin problems, overall.  I store it in a cool area and it hasn&#x27;t discolored.  Such a simple addition to my skin care regimen. I apply first before my daily moisturizer.</li>
            <li> This product i buyed before i ever used and is the best product for around the eye area.  But in this supplier i got the best and low price.</li>
            <li> I think this product was very cheap on amazon and so far is working great with me. I have sensitive skin and it did not irritate me at all...I love it!</li>
            <li> I have not used this product enough to give it any type of decent rating. My main complaint that for under my eyes I would prefer to use a cream rather than a liquid. That may be simply a person preference on my part.</li>
            <li> hiya, sorry about late reply.  absolutely loved the obargi 15%, it just sinks into my skin, @ it feels so nice afterwards, so smooth, @ nice,,,, i use it every single day, never miss, as it is a big part of my beauty rountine, dont know what i would do without it, to be honest, i would be totally lost, obargi serum gets into the derma layers of your skin, so long term it is very effective, i would imagine, thats all i can say really, the best thing ever, obargi products---- a little expensive, but to me worth every penny, i will definitely keep on buying it,</li>
            <li> This is my favorite product of the 3 I bought because it feels like it is closing up the wrinkles and tightening the skin.</li>
            <li> Love the results.  Takes about a week to see but really works.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for more than 10 years. The 5% solution is for around your eyes and the other higher % solutions are for your face and neck area. I use the 20% solution for my face, but led up to that slowly. You will feel a bit a burn sensation, but it goes away within 10 - 15 seconds.  I like all the OBAGI system products but stick with the Nu Derm system and just add the C serums to that particular regime.    One thing I have found however regarding the 20% solution (NOT the 5%)  is that it doesn&#x27;t last me as long as it used to. Perhaps that&#x27;s because I am more diligent about using it and do use it twice a day now with the other OBAGI products. But due to the price of all the Obagi products I have ordered the 20% solution from another vendor which is ½ the price.    As to the 5% solution, I would suggest NOT USING the dropper because it puts out more than you need. I just place my finger over the bottle opening, tip the bottle to wet the finger and that&#x27;s more than enough. It lasts me about 8 months this way.</li>
            <li> This is a great eye cream which helps with fine lines as well as dark circles. I&#x27;m sold.</li>
            <li> I got this after reading such good reviews with a lot of hope for my pigmentation - been using it for almost a month but yet to see any noticeable results! Will update after seeing</li>
            <li> For 2 weeks now, I&#x27;ve been using this Vit C eye serum together with another eye products, with little improvement. I will give this product more time , hopefully with good results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m impressed with shipping and handling of the product.</li>
            <li> First of all, this is NOT a moisturizer. It is meant to even skin tone and smooth the surface.  Continue to use your eye moisturizer after putting the c-serum on.  I like the obaji elasti-derm eye cream.  Next, C serums turn an amber color with age!  A fresh bottle starts out clear.  If it is amber when you get it, it is old.  Finally, it takes a good solid month of use to see results.  Oh, and Always use sunscreen..this makes you more likely to burn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, I have used Obaji for over 3 years and started the c-serum for both eyes and face a year ago.  I have a noticeable reduction in redness, and fine lines.  ( i aslo use the 20% c-serum for the face) I do not know if it helps with dark circles.  You should use the c-serum daily exfoliating moisturizer with it.</li>
            <li> So upset right now, as I just opened the package and it is clearly not real OBAGI! The dropper is all white and OBAGI droppers always have a black top. It also smells Horrible, and real OBAGI has never ever smelled like this. I guess I should have known that price was too good to be true!! Requesting a refund ASAP!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used each morning as per directed with out fail...I haven&#x27;t noticed much of anything yet, after about a month. I guess my dark circles do seem a little less but that could be because I am less anemic (taking iron supplements) though it could also be from this. I paid for it and now it&#x27;s too late to return so I&#x27;ll use the rest of it...which is probably a year supply or more. For about $40 I got a 1/2 oz bottle with a dropper. Directions say 3-5 drops. I use 3 and for both eyes (not a total of 6, but a total of 3 drops per day)...I figure this small bottle will last at least another 6 months at this rate. Many outlets suggest a vitC cream for eyes and some of the benefits will take many months to see so I&#x27;ll continue to use. While certainly not cheap, I have to admit a 1/2 oz bottle will last a very long time. I am not sure if I&#x27;ll buy again, depends on if I see any changes between now and end of my bottle.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry that I ever paid full price.  This product arrived when it was supposed to.  It is the genuine Obagi that I have been using. I will order rom this vender again.</li>
            <li> I have used Obagi products for years and I have to say there isnt anything from their&lt;br /&gt;line that I have not loved.  Although NOTHING prevents wrinkles, this product does&lt;br /&gt;help maintain your skin around your eye area that is so sensitive.</li>
            <li> Love this eye serum.  Have used for years.  Absorbs quickly and keeps skin hydrated and helps with discoloration.  Highly recommend</li>
            <li> I have been using some of the Obagi products as recommended by my dermatologist. By ordering online the products are much less expensive. This Vitamin C serum is amazing. I use it all over my face, not just the eyes. Along with the other products by Obagi my skin has improved much. I just turned sixty and with all the sun bathing I did in my youth my skin had a lot of brown spots. I am very pleased with Obagi !</li>
            <li> results show within days, highly recommend</li>
            <li> Was so excited to find this product.... My sister is now a purchaser as well!!! I have now done at least 5 peels out of this little bottle and there is still some in the bottle!!! I have paid $125.00 for chemical peels that didn&#x27;t do as much peeling as this did!!! This is a &amp;#60;3 for sure!!!!!</li>
            <li> This is a really wonderful product.  It is very smooth and goes on easily.  I have sensitive skin and had no issues.  The product was well packed and arrived on tiem.</li>
            <li> Obagi products are the best!</li>
            <li> I was looking for something to help with the fine lines that have appeared under my eyes, I have used many products, but this is the first time I&#x27;ve seen results.  A bit drying at first, so I&#x27;ve decided to use every other day. I do see a difference, my eye cream helps with the dry feeling, so that&#x27;s not an issue. Very happy with my purchase!</li>
