            <li>So many choices I am now changing my nail polish every day, there is nothing funner than having so many choices and being able to do this at home!  </li>
            <li>I loved that you get so many for cheap</li>
            <li>mostly beautiful designs, some a bit too large.</li>
            <li>;- ) I layer the flowers to make bouquets and it works out great.</li>
            <li>in all, a good buy, fair price, decent shipping time.</li>
            <li>They are just like advertised, but there is one very important flaw.  </li>
            <li>Price was great since nail decals can be very pricey in stores.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re cute but be advised that though you do get 50 sheets, the sheets are about a 1 in to 1 1/2 in do</li>
            <li>I put Seche Vite over top of them, and day 3 they&#x27;re still on.</li>
            <li>There are so many designs.</li>
            <li>They were better than I thought they would be.</li>
            <li>Also there are so many of them.</li>
            <li>The stickers was nice and worth to get I liked it.</li>
            <li>There are some really cute designs.  </li>
            <li>i love them</li>
            <li>Got more then I asked for.</li>
            <li>Love these.</li>
            <li>r ok they come off</li>
            <li>ok u have to use tweezers to get them off</li>
            <li>I like to hand paint pictures on my nails, but sometimes I like being able to have the flowers or what not on my nails with out having to take the time to hand paint them.</li>
            <li>Bought them for my daughter who love&#x27;s to do her nails.</li>
            <li>Love them...</li>
            <li>So many designs to choose from.  </li>
            <li>My sister and daughter love</li>
            <li>Mostly tips/fences/flowers and multi-colored.</li>
            <li>So many designs.  </li>
            <li>the price, though, you do get a lot of cute patterns.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll order again.</li>
            <li>Fantastic value assortment!  </li>
            <li>I stuck the stickers to the table with most of the sticker hanging off --</li>
            <li>Still need a top coat to keep it on the nail longer.</li>
            <li>All my friends love the stickers</li>
            <li>Cheap!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Designs stay on apply 1 more coat to seal</li>
            <li>They are really cute...</li>
            <li>but once the stickers arrived I have to say that they are cute designs and a lot of them.</li>
            <li>I will use most of these, I think.</li>
            <li>I tried using tweezers, toothpicks, anything I could find but ended up ruining more than I was able to put on.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like the top coat didn&#x27;t matter.</li>
            <li>I wonder if there is some sort of oil that prevents the top coat from covering them?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was going to give some to my niece since there are so many, but they don&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>This was a gift and the recipient thoroughly enjoyed it.</li>
            <li>I will be getting more soon as I can.</li>
            <li>I love and will be telling all my friends about them.</li>
            <li>I like these stickers &amp; it looks like I will be able to use them all</li>
            <li>I love these.</li>
            <li>The designs on these are really cute and there are tons.</li>
            <li>and so they are ok for what you pay, I guess.</li>
            <li>But with so many to choose from loosing.</li>
            <li>but i will tell you this I am in love with these stickers i have one on each ring finger as i type this</li>
            <li>but i was ok with that.</li>

            <li>also wish there was more variety.</li>
            <li>To a while to get but absolutely love them.</li>
            <li>Stickers were ok.  </li>
            <li>I use them with gel nail polish, applying them just before the top coat.  </li>
            <li>Sure get a lot of decals for the money.</li>
            <li>Absolutely love these.</li>
            <li>Very worth it !</li>
            <li>She was happy, and there was a decent variety.</li>
            <li>The sizes are good, some are too long for my nails, but I can cut as needed and still use them, anyways I&#x27;m happy.</li>
            <li>TONS AND TONS of super cute stickers!</li>
            <li>it peels off the nail very quickly even when applying a top coat, otherwise its okay</li>
            <li>These decals are pretty good.</li>
            <li>Not disappointed!  </li>
            <li>I get so many compliments and they are my own nails, and I have so much fun doing this my self.  </li>

            <li>Having a lot of fun designing my own nails.  </li>
            <li>Super easy to use!</li>
            <li>Cute and easy to use, def worth the price!</li>
            <li>others have mentioned that these tear easily, and they do.  </li>
            <li>They did ship very quick</li>
            <li>They tear easy.</li>
            <li>Easy to remove from the sheet, I think tweezers help with placement on the nail.</li>
            <li>The decals break easily when trying to lift them of the sheet.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I like them, but they tear easily when you remove them from the sheet</li>
            <li>but they do not lift off as easy as I hoped.</li>
            <li>Easy to put, a lot of choises</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s easy.</li>
            <li>I can mix and match easily with all the choices I have.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really easy to use.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used these because there is a really strong, noxious odor coming from them.  </li>
            <li>It was so strong that I was worried the odor was toxic for me.  </li>
            <li>The stickers are nice and pretty.  </li>
            <li>There are so many cool designs.  </li>
            <li>Nice designs and pretty</li>
            <li>I received an order from another company the day before and they placed a plastic sheet between them and they were fine.</li>
            <li>once on the nail they are fine</li>
            <li>The stickers are fine and don&#x27;t themselves seem to reek on my daughter&#x27;s polished nails.  </li>
            <li>and you&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
            <li>/&gt;These stickers are super cute and make it a cinch.&lt;br</li>
            <li>:) super score on the price too..</li>
            <li>than that I really like these and hope to get more designs!</li>
            <li>Staying on good so far!  </li>
            <li>But the description is accurate and for the price, I was taking a chance.  </li>
            <li>the price of this, it&#x27;s more than worth your money.</li>
            <li>Maybe nail surface should be smooth and even.</li>
            <li>of these would be really cute on kids nails - fun, cartoon-like designs.</li>
            <li>they are, however, cheap and there are tons of them.  </li>
            <li>I guess cheap price cheap product..</li>
            <li>It just kinda looks cheap to me.</li>
            <li>Remember these were cheap, but once you master it...</li>
            <li>Even with topcoat, my nails are not 100% smooth where the stickers</li>
            <li>Even with topcoat, my nails are not 100% smooth where the stickers</li>
            <li>they didn&#x27;t turn out how presented but they were still really cute , it&#x27;s worth it .</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s so many designs to choose from I was able to give a bunch to my daughter and still have enough for tons of my own manicures.</li>
            <li>Guess that&#x27;s why they were so cheap.</li>
            <li>I apply topcoat just in the area I will place the decal and then use my UV light</li>
            <li>These decals are so much cheaper and so many more styles, than you can buy from a beauty supplier.</li>
            <li>Other than that these are really cute and a great price.</li>
            <li>Maybe they became hot in transit and this happened on accident, but I still feel they should have put SOMETHING there to prevent that!!</li>
            <li>There are 50 sheets in this kit, and these were NOT expensive at all!!  </li>
            <li>I recommend removing them with tweezers and making sure you put a clear coat over the top of the sticker so it doesn&#x27;t wear off as easily.</li>
            <li>Very easy to peel and apply stickers to really polish off a nail look.</li>
            <li>The colored designs are all sorts of colors from soft to bold and bright.</li>
            <li>First trying to Get them off the sheets, you need more skill and patience then one person can have.</li>
            <li>If you have long nails, these are great.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth the wait!</li>
            <li>Was excited to get these</li>
            <li>so pretty I love it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had so much fun with these decals!</li>
            <li>Lots of fun!  </li>
            <li>:) my sheets came with an awesome variety some had little mustaches so the girls at work put them on their first fingers and would hod it over their lip (super fun)</li>
            <li>my 6 year old will love them!</li>
            <li>You can go without a top coat if you only want to wear them for a short time, and if your fingers don&#x27;t get extremely warm - when they get warm, they do easily slide around on your nails and the glue gets goopy</li>
            <li>Most are very &amp;#34;girlish&amp;#34; so fantastic for younger girls, but also some more sophisticated designs too.</li>
            <li>These would be good for a teen or something.</li>
            <li>Either way cheap fun stickers</li>
            <li>I really like them and plan to buy more</li>
            <li>Would recommend to anyone that enjoys doing nail art; you can use these to create a fun, flirty look or something more classy for a more formal occasion</li>
            <li>There are some of these I won&#x27;t ever use, but there are many that I really like.  </li>
            <li>so many cute stickers and last forever!</li>
            <li>While I can&#x27;t necessarily say I&#x27;ll buy them again without a promise of more variety, I&#x27;m satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li>One thing I like about the clear plastic backing is that you can hold the sheets over your nail and make sure a given sticker will fit, or decide on the position you want it to be in before applying</li>
            <li>EZ  and quick to put on</li>
            <li>I will most likely buy more if I run out of these.</li>
            <li>so luckily i have</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s a bummer because even using high quality nail polish and top coat (Out the Door or Seche Vite) they wear off after a day or two.</li>
            <li>Every sheet is very pretty.</li>
            <li>Very pretty though.</li>
            <li>They are very pretty.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re really straight forward, and even though I haven&#x27;t bothered to count the pages, I&#x27;m pretty sure</li>
            <li>good price, the polish has to be dry or they will curl.  </li>
            <li>but some do break easily and not come off the sheet very well therefore unusable.</li>
            <li>the idea being that I could then grab the stickers easily with tweezers when I was ready to use them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>(This did not impact my rating in any way.)the idea being that I could then grab the stickers easily with tweezers when I was ready to use them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast and easy.</li>
            <li>Stick one on your nail, brush on a clear coat of polish and you&#x27;re done! :)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not super thrilled with 50 pages of mostly flowers, but I&#x27;ll use them.</li>
            <li>The black and colored ones are a bit better and look great on even clear painted nails.</li>
            <li>I bought this back in 2014, and there amazing.</li>
            <li>/&gt;There&#x27;s quite an amazing variety for such an affordable price.</li>
            <li>It is worth the price.</li>
            <li>Anyway, I am not disappointing.</li>
            <li>Well worth the price.</li>
            <li>but I think its worth it.</li>
            <li>They are a nice size for my nails not too big.</li>
            <li>This is worth the money you spend</li>
            <li>For the price I paid they are worth the buy.</li>
            <li>This was well worth the price.  </li>
            <li>My niece and her friends are having fun also.</li>
            <li>We have been having a lot of fun with these stickers.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s well worth the money.  </li>
            <li>Really fun designs....</li>
            <li>They look really cute and even on my natural nails they stay put.</li>
            <li>they just look like kids stickers, but you can have fun with theme.</li>
            <li>then apply top coat to the entire nail and use the light again.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s very colorful and many different patterns</li>
            <li>Peel and break off super fast!</li>
            <li>some where big flowers, hearts, cute dainty swirl designs i received way more black sheets &amp; white sheets than colored</li>
            <li>(some look like they are good for halloween, but other than that they are genetic designs).</li>
            <li>There is a wonderful selection of black, white or colored stickers.</li>
            <li>They stick perfectly to the nail/nail polish, and with a clear coat over it, they last for several weeks.</li>
            <li>once they&#x27;re on your nails is about the same as any other decal, just use a good top coat.</li>
            <li>These stickers are exactly what I was looking for and the price was right.</li>
            <li>There were a lot of cute and different and colorful stickers.</li>
            <li>Add just a sticker to a French manicure and it adds that extra touch of fancy and cute!!</li>
            <li>Thank you very much.</li>
            <li>I loved them....except the colored stickers seamed like they were for little girls.....</li>
            <li>Also put 1-2 coats of top coat to make it last.</li>
            <li>Pretty</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m more likely to just throw them out.</li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li>I got exactly the amount I paid for.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d have given these 5 stars if I had gotten more variety: stars, stripes, bats, french tips.</li>
            <li>Really really a lot!</li>
            <li>The designs are cute and I didn&#x27;t receive  any 2 of the same sheet.</li>
            <li>Overall, they&#x27;re ok</li>
            <li>but overall I&#x27;ve enjoyed the product.</li>
            <li>I suppose this latter issue just requires a bit more creativity on my part.</li>
            <li>I am giving this item 1 star only because it is as pictured, but you end up tearing most of the decals trying to remove them from the sheets</li>
            <li>You will likely have to wait more than 3 weeks for these to arrive, so if you intend to give them as a gift or use them for some occasion, order well in advance.  </li>

            <li>but i did love maybe ten of the sheets and may end up buying this product again just to get them again.</li>
            <li>/&gt;First, they had a funny odor.</li>
            <li>double up on top coat.</li>
            <li>These are exactly what I was looking for, and you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li>and now my sister is jealous and wants some!</li>
            <li>Love them, still have a ton left.</li>
            <li>I got more sheets of nail stickers cheaper than buying them locally.</li>
            <li>They are soo pretty</li>
            <li>So many, they will last me a life time.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Looks really pretty</li>
            <li>Plenty to choose from and very inexpensive!  </li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a nice variety of designs, they&#x27;re easy to apply and they&#x27;re long lasting.</li>
            <li>The colors and the design are not that good half of theme doesn&#x27;t look real</li>
            <li>There is a good variety of designs, I received a lot of flowers, filigree, stars, dot stripes, roses(very pretty white roses), butterflies, dragonflies, hearts and more (even one sheet with some little holly sprigs on it!).  </li>
            <li>Finging matching sets on certain stencils may be a little hectic but stickers are gorgeous.</li>
            <li>Very cute and came much sooner than expected!</li>
            <li>these be careful when peeling it off because it will tear abd work best on dry nails with a clear coat over it</li>
            <li>I use nail stickers a lot and these are just as good as more expensive products.</li>
            <li>They are beautiful white, black and color ones.</li>
            <li>This is the best few dollars I&#x27;ve spent on my nails this year!</li>
            <li>I got all of the types pictured but almost no black ones, and too many repeats of the same colorful ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Also make sure your nails are fully dry and not tacky at all, otherwise you will not put them on.</li>
            <li>is exactly whats shown here, will fit on tiny nails all stickers under 1/4&#x27; diamiter, came in about 2 weeks!</li>
            <li>I looked at these, read the reviews and passed the first time then added them at the last minute to my order because they were so cheap.</li>
            <li>(Make sure you are putting them on completely dry nail polish or they will curl)&lt;br /&gt;As</li>
            <li>and they still reek of gross strong chemical smell.&lt;br /&gt;All</li>
            <li>I have other nail art stickers that I have purchased at the drugstore that last forever with a good top coat, so I&#x27;ll probably stick with those next time!</li>
            <li>Large selection.</li>
            <li>so it just kind of ends up looking a mess.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve worked in industrial mining laboratories that didn&#x27;t smell half this strong and we were using pure ammonium hydroxide!), then these are worth the couple bucks.</li>
            <li>but overall they are fine</li>
            <li>Especially in the black and white stickers; I like the roses and butterflies the best.</li>
            <li>These adhered to my nails pretty well, without the possibility of being easily moved, so be careful to get them in the position you want the first time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After putting all the stickers on, I followed up with 2 coats of a Seche Vite quick-dry topcoat.  </li>

            <li>I did not get any French tip-style pieces, which is fine by me as I don&#x27;t really like that look.  </li>
            <li>HIGHLY RECOMMEND ;-)</li>
            <li>Such a huge variety of designs.</li>
            <li>Plus reasonable price.</li>
            <li>Most of the stickers rip when trying to remove them from the sheets so you have to be REALLY careful</li>
            <li>There isn&#x27;t much variety in the the batch</li>
            <li>I think the patterns repeat very often ...</li>
            <li>the stickers are very flimsy.</li>
            <li>I guess you really do get what you pay for.</li>
            <li>so this fact doesn&#x27;t upset me too much.</li>
            <li>The stickers are very treatable.  </li>
            <li>&amp;#60;3 thanks for the product.</li>
            <li>so I really dont understand why these are so defective.</li>
            <li>Got a free gift of French tip stickers also.</li>
            <li>really are thousands of stickers to choose from.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>The silver and gold ones look really elegant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Thank you so much for selling these.</li>
            <li>So much for the price.</li>
            <li>They got here much faster than the estimated arrival date.</li>
            <li>and they dont stick very well</li>
            <li>I really like them.</li>
            <li>Better quality than expected.  </li>
            <li>These are rad and priced very well.</li>
            <li>Did not receive the whole 50sheets as stated</li>
            <li>gentle removing them from the sheet.</li>
            <li>but well within their time period of promising it...cant beat what I got for the price</li>
            <li>Some of the white decals are nice and big.</li>
            <li>Overall, I would totally recommend this to anyone that likes to do their own nails.</li>
            <li>but i&#x27;ve gotten packets from other sources with better stickers.</li>
            <li>The multi could have been a better mix compared to what other reviewers received.</li>
            <li>Lots of pages of stickers, way more than I ever expected!  </li>
            <li>Some of the colors are Blues, pinks (bright and light), yellow, gold, green, red, purple, etc.</li>
            <li>The sheets are small, but the decals are cute, sparkly, and just the right size for even the smallest nails.</li>
            <li>Nice small adhesive decals.  </li>
            <li>But overall not bad for the price.</li>
            <li>But some of the stickers are not easy to remove they tear very easy.</li>
            <li>More then half of these ripped to pieces when taking them off their sheets.</li>
            <li>Had a bit of trouble receiving the item, but shop owner was very understanding &amp; helpful and shipped another free of charge!</li>
            <li>At a local store (Walmart, CVS, Walgreens, etc) I know these stickers would cost more and the designs wouldn&#x27;t be to my liking, so these issues I raise are not that big of a deal.</li>
            <li>These are decent decals.  </li>
            <li>Also larger assortment of stickers to many the same.</li>
            <li>The sticker sheets didn&#x27;t have matching stickers, they were very fragile and tore even if you were able to get a hold of one, then you had to search dozens of different sheets to find one to match.</li>
            <li>If you finally manage to do so, they last on your nails even without a top coat.</li>
            <li>Love this product even little fingers to 👌</li>
            <li>pay a little more, and don&#x27;t buy these....</li>
            <li>so many sheets for so little price and</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s good variety in the size of the shapes, small flowers, bigger flowers.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s good variety in color of flowers- blue, pink, purple, yellow, etc etc.</li>
            <li>but thats probably normal with any of these types of products.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m having so much fun with all of the different designs!</li>
            <li>expecially when normally would cost 5 dollars for just 6 sheets in a store.</li>
            <li>I put them on over my dried bottom coat/color, and then put on TWO top coats</li>
            <li>The decals are good, not great.  </li>
            <li>For the reviewers that said they peel of your nails easily, I had no problem with mine after I sealed them down with a few layers of top coat.</li>
            <li>I even throw them on a plain nail and cover with a top coat and leave them like that for the week.</li>
            <li>I have ordered 2 more sets because yes (they smelled strange) &amp; yes (some tore) but not enough to make a significant difference in count, some stickers even had the small pretty jewels attached so jic this seller decides to pull this product im stocking up, &amp; i use them with uv gel polish</li>
            <li>live in california.</li>
            <li>I live in maui and for one sheet of these decals</li>
            <li>Cute - Totally what I expected.</li>
            <li>Just be sure to follow good ventilation practices and ALWAYS use a quality base and topcoat.</li>
            <li>All the sheets were connected but folded in on top of each other to make one big sheet.</li>
            <li>Mostly all flowers, did not get any of the french tip ones as other reviewers did.</li>
            <li>i did i pulled the sheets out right away (they did smell strange)</li>
            <li>I read the reviews about them having a strange smell and didn&#x27;t really think much of it..</li>
            <li>The product did not come exactly as advertised which is disappointing but the price for all these stickers is fair</li>
            <li>I painted my nails (no base coat, although I doubt that matters) with two pretty thick coats of a Julep polish.  </li>
            <li>I painted my nails (no base coat, although I doubt that matters) with two pretty thick coats of a Julep polish.  </li>
            <li>The other caution is once you have placed all the stickers you are going to and want to finish off with a clear top coat, make sure to go over the stickered areas as little as possible as it will take off coloring with multiple strokes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other</li>
            <li>so I had trouble applying the stickers to my nails at first but after getting the right stuff</li>
            <li>The white and black ones are my favorite.</li>
            <li>Love that there are black white and colored choices.</li>
            <li>I prefer the black and white designs, the color ones look a bit too childish for my taste but still a great buy.</li>
            <li>little hard to peel, but overall very good for its price</li>
            <li>: It is hard to keep them on - you need a lot of coating on top.</li>
            <li>Patterns are cute and you get a lot of them, but the stickers are somewhat flimsy and hard to remove without tearing them, and the coloured ones all seem to have their dyes a bit displaced</li>
            <li>I recommend applying a coat of clear polish over the stickers.</li>
            <li>uv gel clear coat  </li>
            <li>Bought these as a gift for a young girl.  </li>
            <li>I bought this for my daughter who is an adult</li>
            <li>are just wow.</li>
            <li>There were a few that were not to my taste, but these were cheap</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been about two days and the stickers are almost completely intact; maybe one or two petals on the flowers I chose have come off.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been about two days and the stickers are almost completely intact; maybe one or two petals on the flowers I chose have come off.  </li>
            <li>and i was pleasantly surprised to receive it so early.</li>
            <li>Of all i tried so far one out of every 5 came off in one piece...</li>
            <li>WOW, if you are looking for a LOT of nail art stickers...........</li>
            <li>Arrived early.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll probably never be able to use those because my nails are unlikely to ever be the right size and shape.  </li>
            <li>i got exactly what was advertised and there isn&#x27;t a duplicate sheet in the bunch, though some sheets have the same shapes, just in different combinations.  </li>
            <li>NO black at all.</li>
            <li>Took a long time to receive them, but in the end, it&#x27;s worth it because you cannot find these designs anywhere in local stores in the US.</li>
            <li>The Black ones and White ones were my favorite but only because many of these already have tiny little rhinestones on the design or in center of flower, etc.  </li>
            <li>These were cute and there are a lot of stickers, but there are several pages that are just mustaches and tobacco pipes which I thought was a little strange.</li>
            <li>I received the 50 sheets, some bright colors with flowers and other girly designs, some sheet of the glow in the dark and some of the black with sparkles.</li>
            <li>One set had OK designs and the other had repeating design with the same color scheme and they were not pretty at all.</li>
            <li>so mine last for weeks not sure about regular top coat.</li>
            <li>may use a few of them on my nails, but a very large portion will be going to my friends 5 year old daughter</li>
            <li>The colored flowers are very pretty on especially if you want to add a tiny Rhinestone or stud to the center</li>
            <li>They take a little longer to get here but are well worth the wait.</li>
            <li>(if I can get them off the backing without ripping which is another customer complaint) but will not order again no matter how cheap.</li>
            <li>and she likes the different looks that this offers.</li>
            <li>:o</li>
            <li>/&gt;They are all pretty similar in design, not much variety</li>
            <li>It did take a few weeks to get them, but it was worth the wait.  </li>
            <li>The clear ones are very delicate and tear easily.  </li>
            <li>They were very pretty but they only give u one half of a sheet so if u want to make all your nails match you will not have enough of the white flower stickers to do both hands.  </li>
            <li>It cheap so easily. :(</li>
            <li>Did it all over again but put just a dap of the glue, after that was dry clear coated them.</li>
            <li>As far as them lasting long.</li>
            <li>They arrived much later than I expected and there is such a strong chemical odor with these stickers, I&#x27;m not sure that I even want to keep them.</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast, no weird smells like other people have noted on other decal stickers from other places.</li>
            <li>sally &amp; hansen instant dry clear polish imediately.&lt;br</li>

    <h2>Negative Reviews</h2>
    <ol>
            <li> It comes with colors of black,white and multi which makes it perfect for any nail colors.</li>

            <li> I just don&#x27;t know how to make look nice on my nail.</li>
            <li> They are a nice size for my fingers.</li>
            <li> But once they are on i can get about a week with a good top coat.</li>
            <li> Some she liked, some she didn&#x27;t,</li>
            <li> I like to do my own manis and pedis.&lt;br</li>

            <li> Kind of a bummer...</li>

            <li> nice..</li>
            <li> Not in any kind of order, not organized at all.  </li>
            <li> These stickers are really nice to apply to nails.</li>

            <li> I love these art sticker decal tips for your nails they are amazing.</li>
            <li> honestly i did not like most of the designs.</li>
            <li> Perfect size and prints are clear..</li>

            <li> So many choices I am now changing my nail polish every day, there is nothing funner than having so many choices and being able to do this at home!  </li>
            <li> I loved that you get so many for cheap</li>
            <li> mostly beautiful designs, some a bit too large.</li>
            <li> ;- ) I layer the flowers to make bouquets and it works out great.</li>
            <li> in all, a good buy, fair price, decent shipping time.</li>
            <li> They are just like advertised, but there is one very important flaw.  </li>
            <li> Price was great since nail decals can be very pricey in stores.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re cute but be advised that though you do get 50 sheets, the sheets are about a 1 in to 1 1/2 in do</li>
            <li> I put Seche Vite over top of them, and day 3 they&#x27;re still on.</li>
            <li> There are so many designs.</li>
            <li> They were better than I thought they would be.</li>
            <li> Also there are so many of them.</li>
            <li> The stickers was nice and worth to get I liked it.</li>
            <li> There are some really cute designs.  </li>
            <li> i love them</li>
            <li> Got more then I asked for.</li>
            <li> Love these.</li>
            <li> r ok they come off</li>
            <li> ok u have to use tweezers to get them off</li>
            <li> I like to hand paint pictures on my nails, but sometimes I like being able to have the flowers or what not on my nails with out having to take the time to hand paint them.</li>
            <li> Bought them for my daughter who love&#x27;s to do her nails.</li>
            <li> Love them...</li>
            <li> So many designs to choose from.  </li>
            <li> My sister and daughter love</li>
            <li> Mostly tips/fences/flowers and multi-colored.</li>
            <li> So many designs.  </li>
            <li> the price, though, you do get a lot of cute patterns.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll order again.</li>
            <li> Fantastic value assortment!  </li>
            <li> I stuck the stickers to the table with most of the sticker hanging off --</li>
            <li> Still need a top coat to keep it on the nail longer.</li>
            <li> All my friends love the stickers</li>
            <li> Cheap!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Designs stay on apply 1 more coat to seal</li>
            <li> They are really cute...</li>
            <li> but once the stickers arrived I have to say that they are cute designs and a lot of them.</li>
            <li> I will use most of these, I think.</li>
            <li> I tried using tweezers, toothpicks, anything I could find but ended up ruining more than I was able to put on.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like the top coat didn&#x27;t matter.</li>
            <li> I wonder if there is some sort of oil that prevents the top coat from covering them?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was going to give some to my niece since there are so many, but they don&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> This was a gift and the recipient thoroughly enjoyed it.</li>
            <li> I will be getting more soon as I can.</li>
            <li> I love and will be telling all my friends about them.</li>
            <li> I like these stickers &amp; it looks like I will be able to use them all</li>
            <li> I love these.</li>
            <li> The designs on these are really cute and there are tons.</li>
            <li> and so they are ok for what you pay, I guess.</li>
            <li> But with so many to choose from loosing.</li>
            <li> but i will tell you this I am in love with these stickers i have one on each ring finger as i type this</li>
            <li> but i was ok with that.</li>

            <li> also wish there was more variety.</li>
            <li> To a while to get but absolutely love them.</li>
            <li> Stickers were ok.  </li>
            <li> I use them with gel nail polish, applying them just before the top coat.  </li>
            <li> Sure get a lot of decals for the money.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love these.</li>
            <li> Very worth it !</li>
            <li> She was happy, and there was a decent variety.</li>
            <li> The sizes are good, some are too long for my nails, but I can cut as needed and still use them, anyways I&#x27;m happy.</li>
            <li> TONS AND TONS of super cute stickers!</li>
            <li> it peels off the nail very quickly even when applying a top coat, otherwise its okay</li>
            <li> These decals are pretty good.</li>
            <li> Not disappointed!  </li>
            <li> I get so many compliments and they are my own nails, and I have so much fun doing this my self.  </li>
            <li> Shipping was very quick decals dont stick to well but love all the color flowets</li>
            <li> I LOVED THIS product so much,  I ordered more.</li>

            <li> Having a lot of fun designing my own nails.  </li>
            <li> Super easy to use!</li>
            <li> Cute and easy to use, def worth the price!</li>
            <li> others have mentioned that these tear easily, and they do.  </li>
            <li> They did ship very quick</li>
            <li> They tear easy.</li>
            <li> Easy to remove from the sheet, I think tweezers help with placement on the nail.</li>
            <li> The decals break easily when trying to lift them of the sheet.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I like them, but they tear easily when you remove them from the sheet</li>
            <li> but they do not lift off as easy as I hoped.</li>
            <li> Easy to put, a lot of choises</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s easy.</li>
            <li> I can mix and match easily with all the choices I have.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really easy to use.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used these because there is a really strong, noxious odor coming from them.  </li>
            <li> It was so strong that I was worried the odor was toxic for me.  </li>
            <li> The stickers are nice and pretty.  </li>
            <li> There are so many cool designs.  </li>
            <li> Nice designs and pretty</li>
            <li> I received an order from another company the day before and they placed a plastic sheet between them and they were fine.</li>
            <li> once on the nail they are fine</li>
            <li> The stickers are fine and don&#x27;t themselves seem to reek on my daughter&#x27;s polished nails.  </li>
            <li> and you&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
            <li> /&gt;These stickers are super cute and make it a cinch.&lt;br</li>
            <li> :) super score on the price too..</li>
            <li> than that I really like these and hope to get more designs!</li>
            <li> Staying on good so far!  </li>
            <li> But the description is accurate and for the price, I was taking a chance.  </li>
            <li> the price of this, it&#x27;s more than worth your money.</li>
            <li> Maybe nail surface should be smooth and even.</li>
            <li> of these would be really cute on kids nails - fun, cartoon-like designs.</li>
            <li> they are, however, cheap and there are tons of them.  </li>
            <li> I guess cheap price cheap product..</li>
            <li> It just kinda looks cheap to me.</li>
            <li> Remember these were cheap, but once you master it...</li>
            <li> Even with topcoat, my nails are not 100% smooth where the stickers</li>
            <li> Even with topcoat, my nails are not 100% smooth where the stickers</li>
            <li> they didn&#x27;t turn out how presented but they were still really cute , it&#x27;s worth it .</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s so many designs to choose from I was able to give a bunch to my daughter and still have enough for tons of my own manicures.</li>
            <li> Guess that&#x27;s why they were so cheap.</li>
            <li> I apply topcoat just in the area I will place the decal and then use my UV light</li>
            <li> These decals are so much cheaper and so many more styles, than you can buy from a beauty supplier.</li>
            <li> Other than that these are really cute and a great price.</li>
            <li> Maybe they became hot in transit and this happened on accident, but I still feel they should have put SOMETHING there to prevent that!!</li>
            <li> There are 50 sheets in this kit, and these were NOT expensive at all!!  </li>
            <li> I recommend removing them with tweezers and making sure you put a clear coat over the top of the sticker so it doesn&#x27;t wear off as easily.</li>
            <li> Very easy to peel and apply stickers to really polish off a nail look.</li>
            <li> The colored designs are all sorts of colors from soft to bold and bright.</li>
            <li> First trying to Get them off the sheets, you need more skill and patience then one person can have.</li>
            <li> If you have long nails, these are great.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s worth the wait!</li>
            <li> Was excited to get these</li>
            <li> so pretty I love it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had so much fun with these decals!</li>
            <li> Lots of fun!  </li>
            <li> :) my sheets came with an awesome variety some had little mustaches so the girls at work put them on their first fingers and would hod it over their lip (super fun)</li>
            <li> my 6 year old will love them!</li>
            <li> You can go without a top coat if you only want to wear them for a short time, and if your fingers don&#x27;t get extremely warm - when they get warm, they do easily slide around on your nails and the glue gets goopy</li>
            <li> Most are very &amp;#34;girlish&amp;#34; so fantastic for younger girls, but also some more sophisticated designs too.</li>
            <li> These would be good for a teen or something.</li>
            <li> Either way cheap fun stickers</li>
            <li> I really like them and plan to buy more</li>
            <li> Would recommend to anyone that enjoys doing nail art; you can use these to create a fun, flirty look or something more classy for a more formal occasion</li>
            <li> There are some of these I won&#x27;t ever use, but there are many that I really like.  </li>
            <li> so many cute stickers and last forever!</li>
            <li> While I can&#x27;t necessarily say I&#x27;ll buy them again without a promise of more variety, I&#x27;m satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li> One thing I like about the clear plastic backing is that you can hold the sheets over your nail and make sure a given sticker will fit, or decide on the position you want it to be in before applying</li>
            <li> EZ  and quick to put on</li>
            <li> I will most likely buy more if I run out of these.</li>
            <li> so luckily i have</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s a bummer because even using high quality nail polish and top coat (Out the Door or Seche Vite) they wear off after a day or two.</li>
            <li> Every sheet is very pretty.</li>
            <li> Very pretty though.</li>
            <li> They are very pretty.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re really straight forward, and even though I haven&#x27;t bothered to count the pages, I&#x27;m pretty sure</li>
            <li> good price, the polish has to be dry or they will curl.  </li>
            <li> but some do break easily and not come off the sheet very well therefore unusable.</li>
            <li> the idea being that I could then grab the stickers easily with tweezers when I was ready to use them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> (This did not impact my rating in any way.)the idea being that I could then grab the stickers easily with tweezers when I was ready to use them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast and easy.</li>
            <li> Stick one on your nail, brush on a clear coat of polish and you&#x27;re done! :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not super thrilled with 50 pages of mostly flowers, but I&#x27;ll use them.</li>
            <li> The black and colored ones are a bit better and look great on even clear painted nails.</li>
            <li> I bought this back in 2014, and there amazing.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There&#x27;s quite an amazing variety for such an affordable price.</li>
            <li> It is worth the price.</li>
            <li> Anyway, I am not disappointing.</li>
            <li> Well worth the price.</li>
            <li> but I think its worth it.</li>
            <li> They are a nice size for my nails not too big.</li>
            <li> This is worth the money you spend</li>
            <li> For the price I paid they are worth the buy.</li>
            <li> This was well worth the price.  </li>
            <li> My niece and her friends are having fun also.</li>
            <li> We have been having a lot of fun with these stickers.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s well worth the money.  </li>
            <li> Really fun designs....</li>
            <li> They look really cute and even on my natural nails they stay put.</li>
            <li> they just look like kids stickers, but you can have fun with theme.</li>
            <li> then apply top coat to the entire nail and use the light again.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very colorful and many different patterns</li>
            <li> Peel and break off super fast!</li>
            <li> some where big flowers, hearts, cute dainty swirl designs i received way more black sheets &amp; white sheets than colored</li>
            <li> (some look like they are good for halloween, but other than that they are genetic designs).</li>
            <li> There is a wonderful selection of black, white or colored stickers.</li>
            <li> They stick perfectly to the nail/nail polish, and with a clear coat over it, they last for several weeks.</li>
            <li> once they&#x27;re on your nails is about the same as any other decal, just use a good top coat.</li>
            <li> These stickers are exactly what I was looking for and the price was right.</li>
            <li> There were a lot of cute and different and colorful stickers.</li>
            <li> Add just a sticker to a French manicure and it adds that extra touch of fancy and cute!!</li>
            <li> Thank you very much.</li>
            <li> I loved them....except the colored stickers seamed like they were for little girls.....</li>
            <li> Also put 1-2 coats of top coat to make it last.</li>
            <li> Pretty</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m more likely to just throw them out.</li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;m satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li> I got exactly the amount I paid for.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d have given these 5 stars if I had gotten more variety: stars, stripes, bats, french tips.</li>
            <li> Really really a lot!</li>
            <li> The designs are cute and I didn&#x27;t receive  any 2 of the same sheet.</li>
            <li> Overall, they&#x27;re ok</li>
            <li> but overall I&#x27;ve enjoyed the product.</li>
            <li> I suppose this latter issue just requires a bit more creativity on my part.</li>
            <li> I am giving this item 1 star only because it is as pictured, but you end up tearing most of the decals trying to remove them from the sheets</li>
            <li> You will likely have to wait more than 3 weeks for these to arrive, so if you intend to give them as a gift or use them for some occasion, order well in advance.  </li>

            <li> but i did love maybe ten of the sheets and may end up buying this product again just to get them again.</li>
            <li> /&gt;First, they had a funny odor.</li>
            <li> double up on top coat.</li>
            <li> These are exactly what I was looking for, and you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li> and now my sister is jealous and wants some!</li>
            <li> Love them, still have a ton left.</li>
            <li> I got more sheets of nail stickers cheaper than buying them locally.</li>
            <li> They are soo pretty</li>
            <li> So many, they will last me a life time.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Looks really pretty</li>
            <li> Plenty to choose from and very inexpensive!  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a nice variety of designs, they&#x27;re easy to apply and they&#x27;re long lasting.</li>
            <li> The colors and the design are not that good half of theme doesn&#x27;t look real</li>
            <li> There is a good variety of designs, I received a lot of flowers, filigree, stars, dot stripes, roses(very pretty white roses), butterflies, dragonflies, hearts and more (even one sheet with some little holly sprigs on it!).  </li>
            <li> Finging matching sets on certain stencils may be a little hectic but stickers are gorgeous.</li>
            <li> Very cute and came much sooner than expected!</li>
            <li> these be careful when peeling it off because it will tear abd work best on dry nails with a clear coat over it</li>
            <li> I use nail stickers a lot and these are just as good as more expensive products.</li>
            <li> They are beautiful white, black and color ones.</li>
            <li> This is the best few dollars I&#x27;ve spent on my nails this year!</li>
            <li> I got all of the types pictured but almost no black ones, and too many repeats of the same colorful ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also make sure your nails are fully dry and not tacky at all, otherwise you will not put them on.</li>
            <li> is exactly whats shown here, will fit on tiny nails all stickers under 1/4&#x27; diamiter, came in about 2 weeks!</li>
            <li> I looked at these, read the reviews and passed the first time then added them at the last minute to my order because they were so cheap.</li>
            <li> (Make sure you are putting them on completely dry nail polish or they will curl)&lt;br /&gt;As</li>
            <li> and they still reek of gross strong chemical smell.&lt;br /&gt;All</li>
            <li> I have other nail art stickers that I have purchased at the drugstore that last forever with a good top coat, so I&#x27;ll probably stick with those next time!</li>
            <li> Large selection.</li>
            <li> so it just kind of ends up looking a mess.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve worked in industrial mining laboratories that didn&#x27;t smell half this strong and we were using pure ammonium hydroxide!), then these are worth the couple bucks.</li>
            <li> but overall they are fine</li>
            <li> Especially in the black and white stickers; I like the roses and butterflies the best.</li>
            <li> These adhered to my nails pretty well, without the possibility of being easily moved, so be careful to get them in the position you want the first time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After putting all the stickers on, I followed up with 2 coats of a Seche Vite quick-dry topcoat.  </li>

            <li> I did not get any French tip-style pieces, which is fine by me as I don&#x27;t really like that look.  </li>
            <li> HIGHLY RECOMMEND ;-)</li>
            <li> Such a huge variety of designs.</li>
            <li> Plus reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Most of the stickers rip when trying to remove them from the sheets so you have to be REALLY careful</li>
            <li> There isn&#x27;t much variety in the the batch</li>
            <li> I think the patterns repeat very often ...</li>
            <li> the stickers are very flimsy.</li>
            <li> I guess you really do get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> so this fact doesn&#x27;t upset me too much.</li>
            <li> The stickers are very treatable.  </li>
            <li> &amp;#60;3 thanks for the product.</li>
            <li> so I really dont understand why these are so defective.</li>
            <li> Got a free gift of French tip stickers also.</li>
            <li> really are thousands of stickers to choose from.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> The silver and gold ones look really elegant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Thank you so much for selling these.</li>
            <li> So much for the price.</li>
            <li> They got here much faster than the estimated arrival date.</li>
            <li> and they dont stick very well</li>
            <li> I really like them.</li>
            <li> Better quality than expected.  </li>
            <li> These are rad and priced very well.</li>
            <li> Did not receive the whole 50sheets as stated</li>
            <li> gentle removing them from the sheet.</li>
            <li> but well within their time period of promising it...cant beat what I got for the price</li>
            <li> Some of the white decals are nice and big.</li>
            <li> Overall, I would totally recommend this to anyone that likes to do their own nails.</li>
            <li> but i&#x27;ve gotten packets from other sources with better stickers.</li>
            <li> The multi could have been a better mix compared to what other reviewers received.</li>
            <li> Lots of pages of stickers, way more than I ever expected!  </li>
            <li> Some of the colors are Blues, pinks (bright and light), yellow, gold, green, red, purple, etc.</li>
            <li> The sheets are small, but the decals are cute, sparkly, and just the right size for even the smallest nails.</li>
            <li> Nice small adhesive decals.  </li>
            <li> But overall not bad for the price.</li>
            <li> But some of the stickers are not easy to remove they tear very easy.</li>
            <li> More then half of these ripped to pieces when taking them off their sheets.</li>
            <li> Had a bit of trouble receiving the item, but shop owner was very understanding &amp; helpful and shipped another free of charge!</li>
            <li> At a local store (Walmart, CVS, Walgreens, etc) I know these stickers would cost more and the designs wouldn&#x27;t be to my liking, so these issues I raise are not that big of a deal.</li>
            <li> These are decent decals.  </li>
            <li> Also larger assortment of stickers to many the same.</li>
            <li> The sticker sheets didn&#x27;t have matching stickers, they were very fragile and tore even if you were able to get a hold of one, then you had to search dozens of different sheets to find one to match.</li>
            <li> If you finally manage to do so, they last on your nails even without a top coat.</li>
            <li> Love this product even little fingers to 👌</li>
            <li> pay a little more, and don&#x27;t buy these....</li>
            <li> so many sheets for so little price and</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s good variety in the size of the shapes, small flowers, bigger flowers.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s good variety in color of flowers- blue, pink, purple, yellow, etc etc.</li>
            <li> but thats probably normal with any of these types of products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m having so much fun with all of the different designs!</li>
            <li> expecially when normally would cost 5 dollars for just 6 sheets in a store.</li>
            <li> I put them on over my dried bottom coat/color, and then put on TWO top coats</li>
            <li> The decals are good, not great.  </li>
            <li> For the reviewers that said they peel of your nails easily, I had no problem with mine after I sealed them down with a few layers of top coat.</li>
            <li> I even throw them on a plain nail and cover with a top coat and leave them like that for the week.</li>
            <li> I have ordered 2 more sets because yes (they smelled strange) &amp; yes (some tore) but not enough to make a significant difference in count, some stickers even had the small pretty jewels attached so jic this seller decides to pull this product im stocking up, &amp; i use them with uv gel polish</li>
            <li> live in california.</li>
            <li> I live in maui and for one sheet of these decals</li>
            <li> Cute - Totally what I expected.</li>
            <li> Just be sure to follow good ventilation practices and ALWAYS use a quality base and topcoat.</li>
            <li> All the sheets were connected but folded in on top of each other to make one big sheet.</li>
            <li> Mostly all flowers, did not get any of the french tip ones as other reviewers did.</li>
            <li> i did i pulled the sheets out right away (they did smell strange)</li>
            <li> I read the reviews about them having a strange smell and didn&#x27;t really think much of it..</li>
            <li> The product did not come exactly as advertised which is disappointing but the price for all these stickers is fair</li>
            <li> I painted my nails (no base coat, although I doubt that matters) with two pretty thick coats of a Julep polish.  </li>
            <li> I painted my nails (no base coat, although I doubt that matters) with two pretty thick coats of a Julep polish.  </li>
            <li> The other caution is once you have placed all the stickers you are going to and want to finish off with a clear top coat, make sure to go over the stickered areas as little as possible as it will take off coloring with multiple strokes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other</li>
            <li> so I had trouble applying the stickers to my nails at first but after getting the right stuff</li>
            <li> The white and black ones are my favorite.</li>
            <li> Love that there are black white and colored choices.</li>
            <li> I prefer the black and white designs, the color ones look a bit too childish for my taste but still a great buy.</li>
            <li> little hard to peel, but overall very good for its price</li>
            <li> : It is hard to keep them on - you need a lot of coating on top.</li>
            <li> Patterns are cute and you get a lot of them, but the stickers are somewhat flimsy and hard to remove without tearing them, and the coloured ones all seem to have their dyes a bit displaced</li>
            <li> I recommend applying a coat of clear polish over the stickers.</li>
            <li> uv gel clear coat  </li>
            <li> Bought these as a gift for a young girl.  </li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter who is an adult</li>
            <li> are just wow.</li>
            <li> There were a few that were not to my taste, but these were cheap</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been about two days and the stickers are almost completely intact; maybe one or two petals on the flowers I chose have come off.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been about two days and the stickers are almost completely intact; maybe one or two petals on the flowers I chose have come off.  </li>
            <li> and i was pleasantly surprised to receive it so early.</li>
            <li> Of all i tried so far one out of every 5 came off in one piece...</li>
            <li> WOW, if you are looking for a LOT of nail art stickers...........</li>
            <li> Arrived early.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll probably never be able to use those because my nails are unlikely to ever be the right size and shape.  </li>
            <li> i got exactly what was advertised and there isn&#x27;t a duplicate sheet in the bunch, though some sheets have the same shapes, just in different combinations.  </li>
            <li> NO black at all.</li>
            <li> Took a long time to receive them, but in the end, it&#x27;s worth it because you cannot find these designs anywhere in local stores in the US.</li>
            <li> The Black ones and White ones were my favorite but only because many of these already have tiny little rhinestones on the design or in center of flower, etc.  </li>
            <li> These were cute and there are a lot of stickers, but there are several pages that are just mustaches and tobacco pipes which I thought was a little strange.</li>
            <li> I received the 50 sheets, some bright colors with flowers and other girly designs, some sheet of the glow in the dark and some of the black with sparkles.</li>
            <li> One set had OK designs and the other had repeating design with the same color scheme and they were not pretty at all.</li>
            <li> so mine last for weeks not sure about regular top coat.</li>
            <li> may use a few of them on my nails, but a very large portion will be going to my friends 5 year old daughter</li>
            <li> The colored flowers are very pretty on especially if you want to add a tiny Rhinestone or stud to the center</li>
            <li> They take a little longer to get here but are well worth the wait.</li>
            <li> (if I can get them off the backing without ripping which is another customer complaint) but will not order again no matter how cheap.</li>
            <li> and she likes the different looks that this offers.</li>
            <li> :o</li>
            <li> /&gt;They are all pretty similar in design, not much variety</li>
            <li> It did take a few weeks to get them, but it was worth the wait.  </li>
            <li> The clear ones are very delicate and tear easily.  </li>
            <li> They were very pretty but they only give u one half of a sheet so if u want to make all your nails match you will not have enough of the white flower stickers to do both hands.  </li>
            <li> It cheap so easily. :(</li>
            <li> Did it all over again but put just a dap of the glue, after that was dry clear coated them.</li>
            <li> As far as them lasting long.</li>
            <li> They arrived much later than I expected and there is such a strong chemical odor with these stickers, I&#x27;m not sure that I even want to keep them.</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast, no weird smells like other people have noted on other decal stickers from other places.</li>
            <li> sally &amp; hansen instant dry clear polish imediately.&lt;br</li>
            <li> (and I mean seriously, it&#x27;s powerful -</li>
            <li> They are small enough to fit on little fingers.</li>
            <li> She has also told me that other people think it is professionally done.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> I would use a tool and still be careful when placing them on your nail, because as I said they stick very well and they won&#x27;t budge once they have been put down.</li>
            <li> Then again I haven&#x27;t found any decorative stickers that last long on nails.</li>
            <li> They usually last as long as the rest of the manicure.</li>
            <li> I finally gave up on all but the simplest design for a single flower.</li>
            <li> Oddly, I ordered what I thought were completely different sets of decals from two different distributors, and I received two of the same 50-sheet sets.</li>
            <li> You do have to be careful pulling the smaller ones, but I have had this issue with all them despite the price.</li>
            <li> I received mine earlier then expected.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m giving them 2 stars because of how long it took to ship them.</li>
            <li> White and 30 of the same flower in a few different colors.</li>
            <li> Being a student and using my hands a lot, I cannot grow my nails out THAT long.</li>
            <li> you think you might get cancer if you breathe it in too long, you know?</li>
            <li> BUT took a long time to arrive</li>
            <li> Got this in the mail today 2 weeks earlier than expected.  </li>
            <li> I figure it&#x27;s from the stickers and/or the plastic of the packaging and being enclosed for so long.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s all yellow and pink, and lavender.  </li>
            <li> The white and black stickers are as expected but the multi-colored ones are not the same as in the picture posted I only received ones that are a light blue and pink not the random colors like in the picture.</li>
            <li> Only con and my reason for giving four stars is stickers are extremely fragile and must be lifted off stencil with extreme caution!</li>
            <li> so i can use to add to my nails such as bows,  flowers,  brand logos such as dior and chanel, and other stickers!</li>
            <li> Next time I buy decals I might just buy black or white ones.</li>
            <li> I got 15 sheets of white stickers, 15 sheets of black and white stickers (sometimes all-black and all-white stickers on the same sheet, sometimes a sticker that had both black and white areas), and 20 sheets of colored stickers.  </li>
            <li> I only got the black &amp;white stickers no color -___-</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ll see how long that lasts!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if they were all different because I didn&#x27;t compare every sheet to every other sheet.  </li>
            <li> of the stickers are pretty small, some even small enough for use on a child (hey, my sister gets my 2- and 4-year-old nieces&#x27; nails done).  </li>
            <li> main reason for giving 3 stars instead of 4 is that they&#x27;re extremely hard to pull off of the sheet, even with tweezers.</li>
            <li> When it was dry to the touch, I placed the stickers using tweezers.  </li>
            <li> When it was dry to the touch, I placed the stickers using tweezers.  </li>
            <li> I wish the colored stickers had a few larger options like the white do</li>
            <li> I have paid the same amount for only a few sheets.</li>
            <li> Shipping took a long time but that&#x27;s to be expected.</li>
            <li> None of the stickers have fallen off or have come loose.  </li>
            <li> None of the stickers have fallen off or have come loose.  </li>
            <li> I placed white ones on the regular nail polish and they stayed for as long as nail polish stayed, but when I placed black ones on the nail polish with a little glitter for some reason, they did not lasted at all.</li>
            <li> The rip in half, roll over and just all in all out of one sheet may get enough for 3 nails.</li>
            <li> Advertised is 14 sheets white stickers, 15 sheets black stickers, and 22 sheets of multicolor stickers.</li>
            <li> WhatI received instead was 8 sheets of white stickers, 4 sheets of silver stickers, 9 sheets of black and white stickers, 7 sheets of black stickers, 11 sheets of black and multicolor stickers, 8 sheets of multicolor stickers and 3 sheets of white &amp;#34;french tip&amp;#34; stickers.</li>
            <li> It was not an even 14 white, 14 black, and 22 color.</li>
            <li> White multicolored and a black set.</li>
            <li> You get 20 sheets of colored designs, 15 sheets of black and 15 white.  </li>
            <li> I did get lots of black and white sheets, but the multicolored ones are all pastel and not nearly so vibrant as the photos led me to believe.  </li>
            <li> Got a variety of white, black, and multi.</li>
            <li> 15 Black, 14 White and 20 Color (counted 3 times).  </li>
            <li> not to bad, nice designs but half fall apart when getting them off the sheet</li>
            <li> There is a wide verity of black, white, and colored.</li>
            <li> I thought they were going to be really ugly or very cheaply made</li>
            <li> The only reason I&#x27;m giving these four stars is some of the colored decals look a little pixelated.</li>
            <li> But the one thing is you want to peel them off very slowly because one I peeled it really fast the sticker ripped.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately they do not last - I realize they are really inexpensive</li>
            <li> Have to make sure to use the largest ones, otherwise they look like dirty spots on your nails, even a few feet away.</li>
            <li> Took 20 days for shipping, which was expected.  </li>
            <li> you have to be careful when you take them off the plastic</li>
            <li> Instead of a few white</li>
            <li> I got colorful angry birds, and 2 or 3 all gold sheets with logos like LV as designs.</li>
            <li> Just have to be careful when removeing.</li>
            <li> 48 of the sheets were thick, rigid, clear plastic and 2 of them</li>
            <li> and I expected that.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re not without a few problems, but overall I&#x27;m satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re not without a few problems, but overall I&#x27;m satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Be careful though because they like to split while your taking them off.</li>
            <li> Just remove them carefully from the plastic</li>
            <li> Not really for a date work days maybe</li>
            <li> came before they were expected too.</li>
            <li> Other than that awful little tidbit of information, the stickers seem to be very good quality.</li>
            <li> It was a little long getting here</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many of these and have not been disappointed.</li>
            <li> I just wanted other buyers to know</li>
            <li> I did get a few stickers that seem designed to go at the end of rather long nails.  </li>
            <li> But again, those made up only a small percentage of the total.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OK, on to using these.  </li>
            <li> None of mine were stuck together as some of the other reviews have stated.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical a first due to the price, but it turns out that I had nothing to worry about.</li>
            <li> I got 15 white sheets, 15 black sheets (some had small rhinestones) and 20 colored sheets.</li>
            <li> Got the order a little over a week which was sooner than expected coming from Thailand.</li>
            <li> At least I did receive a total of 50 sheets, so I wasn&#x27;t short-changed.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really off-putting and makes me wary to use/</li>
            <li> You do have to be real careful when removing the decals because they will tear.  </li>
            <li> handle these too often lest I come down with some sort of chemical poisoning.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The black ones doesn&#x27;t come up in one piece.</li>
            <li> When you try to peel a sticker off, it cracks, or peels off half the sticker....</li>
            <li> Not real pleased with packaging.</li>
            <li> The sticker material is VERY delicate and will tear if you&#x27;re not careful.</li>
            <li> poorly - sheets weren&#x27;t all facing the same direction so some stickers were lost when they stuck to each other, smooshed, and couldn&#x27;t be separated.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Alot for a little $$.</li>
            <li> and that seemed to help a little bit.</li>
            <li> They are even a little raised/3D</li>
            <li> Had a bad weird smell for days when you first open packaging, the colored ones do have a digital look to them</li>
            <li> Childish won&#x27;t buy again</li>
            <li> Lots of designs including glow in the dark and some with small rhinestones in them.&lt;br /&gt;Some</li>
            <li> Second, they were packaged poorly.</li>
            <li> And lastly, I was not happy with the selection I received.</li>
            <li> I ripped one (but the sheet had a few duplicates, so I just took another one like it and used it instead).  </li>
            <li> I ripped one (but the sheet had a few duplicates, so I just took another one like it and used it instead).  </li>
            <li> A few sheets I wouldn&#x27;t wear, but maybe you would</li>
            <li> but you do waste a few to get them off the paper.</li>
            <li> So... when you pull them apart the stick to each other!!!</li>
            <li> Also, the adhesive is hard to get off after they have been on your nails for a few days</li>
            <li> they&#x27;re small sheets.</li>
            <li> The sheets are small though</li>
            <li> The price was unbelievable.</li>
            <li> The designs are extremely small and they don&#x27;t stay on your nail.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had this much trouble with decals!</li>
            <li> I am not pleased .I</li>
            <li> Not sure how one is supposed to get the stickers off the page without tearing them.</li>
            <li> Second, it is difficult to remove a decal from the plastic without ripping it.</li>
            <li> But they are very tiny, which makes it difficult to put on the nail.</li>
            <li> The only complaint I have and the only reason I didn&#x27;t give the product 4 or 5 stars is because it took a very long time to arrive, and it smells very bad.  </li>
            <li> but they sick very well to my nails.</li>
            <li> I am really glad i took a chance on these, i was a little leary after reading all the bad reviews but decided i was sick of paying $4.99 for a pack of 3 at wal mart or sally&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> the stickers are hard to get off the sheet without ripping them</li>
            <li> It is hard to get a sticker out without something tearing, it can be done</li>
            <li> I like the stickers, but they are really hard to peel off without tearing them, plus the rub off within a week.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I am very unhappy and disappointed because the decals are very cute and versatile.</li>
            <li> but it sucks trying to peel them off with out tearing them.</li>
            <li> but dang they SERIOUSLY have a horr</li>
            <li> Some of the flower ones look a little cheesy and kid-ish, but I will use those on my nieces&#x27; toes.</li>
            <li> Weird, and a little disappointing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> First, they have an awful odor to them.</li>
            <li> Very hard to keep each sticker from breaking.  </li>
            <li> but very hard to get of sheet..broke alot of them just trying to get them off..</li>
            <li> (Don&#x27;t know if the smell is gone now from the whole lot as I&#x27;ve no desire to check and submit my nose to that dreadful smell.)</li>
            <li> I mean don&#x27;t get me wrong</li>
            <li> Did not get all the stencils, the stickers were very hard to remove and it was way expensive shipping took a couple of weeks wont be buying again .</li>
            <li> This is particularly disappointing, because I was expecting at least some variation.  </li>
            <li> Very low quality, the sticker does peels off very badly and tears.</li>
            <li> designs look sloppy (color misaligned with outlines, random designs - fences??).&lt;br /&gt;Shipped</li>
            <li> Not amazing, but not too bad either.</li>
            <li> Needless to Sat</li>
            <li> if you like flowers and weird frilly things, these are for you.  </li>
            <li> but at this price you can&#x27;t go wrong.  </li>
            <li> I did not find them terribly difficult to get off the sheets.  </li>
            <li> Difficult to get the stickers off without mangling them.</li>
            <li> but I was wrong.</li>
            <li> sorry</li>
            <li> im really disappointed with this nail art :/</li>
            <li> If you grab them the wrong way they will break off.</li>
            <li> They do smell a little of moth balls or something, but it wasn&#x27;t horrible.</li>
            <li> The bag with the stickers smells heavily of gasoline or paint, a terrible odor.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed that the decals are so difficult to get off the sheet.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s very difficult.</li>
            <li> They smell really bad.</li>
            <li> another reviewer stated, they do smell, very badly of chemicals.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed in product</li>
            <li> Smells terrible.</li>
            <li> is the smell, which is terrible and the length they stay on nails</li>
            <li> But the smell is/was horrible upon opening.  </li>
            <li> We had to air out the room, it was that awful.  </li>
            <li> Had a terrible time trying to get these off the package without them ripping apart.  </li>
            <li> They are just awful!</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s just a really, really awful chemical</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I bought this back in 2014, and there amazing. It comes with colors of black,white and multi which makes it perfect for any nail colors.But the one thing is you want to peel them off very slowly because one I peeled it really fast the sticker ripped. Also put 1-2 coats of top coat to make it last.</li>
            <li> love them! so many cute stickers and last forever!</li>
            <li> I got 15 white sheets, 15 black sheets (some had small rhinestones) and 20 colored sheets. The variety wasn&#x27;t great. A couple sheets of butterflies and hearts, 1 sheet of crowns and all the rest were flower designs. Took 20 days for shipping, which was expected.  Price was great since nail decals can be very pricey in stores.</li>
            <li> beautiful and easy to use, but oh the smell</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re cute but be advised that though you do get 50 sheets, the sheets are about a 1 in to 1 1/2 in do they&#x27;re small sheets. I still like them.</li>
            <li> I Received this product and I was very pleased. It met my expectations and I received 50 sheets as was represented.</li>
            <li> Alot for a little $$. Pretty</li>
            <li> I like this product. Very nice art and easy to use. Plus reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Very good designs and quality!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used these because there is a really strong, noxious odor coming from them.  It makes me wonder what chemicals are used here.  I&#x27;m letting them air out but I&#x27;m more likely to just throw them out.</li>
            <li> Bought these as a gift for a young girl.  She was happy, and there was a decent variety.</li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;m satisfied with the product. They&#x27;re really straight forward, and even though I haven&#x27;t bothered to count the pages, I&#x27;m pretty sure I got exactly the amount I paid for. There&#x27;s good variety in the size of the shapes, small flowers, bigger flowers. There&#x27;s good variety in color of flowers- blue, pink, purple, yellow, etc etc. I like flowers alright. I&#x27;m not super thrilled with 50 pages of mostly flowers, but I&#x27;ll use them. I&#x27;d have given these 5 stars if I had gotten more variety: stars, stripes, bats, french tips. Se la vie. I put Seche Vite over top of them, and day 3 they&#x27;re still on. We&#x27;ll see how long that lasts! While I can&#x27;t necessarily say I&#x27;ll buy them again without a promise of more variety, I&#x27;m satisfied with my purchase. Shipping was fast, no weird smells like other people have noted on other decal stickers from other places. *shrugs*</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter who is an adult and she loves it. She loves doing her own toes and fingers and she likes the different looks that this offers. She has also told me that other people think it is professionally done.&lt;br /&gt;For the price of this, it&#x27;s more than worth your money. I would buy this again.</li>
            <li> If you have daughters or do your nails a lot these are awesome for the price. There are so many designs. You do have to be careful pulling the smaller ones, but I have had this issue with all them despite the price. I even throw them on a plain nail and cover with a top coat and leave them like that for the week.</li>
            <li> Childish won&#x27;t buy again I go for elegant this is great for child like nail art still good product just be easy taking off the paper to apply as with almost all</li>
            <li> Great nail stickers arrived on time and its soon much fun</li>
            <li> These would be good for a teen or something. I painted my nails, then began to try and put these on. First trying to Get them off the sheets, you need more skill and patience then one person can have. The rip in half, roll over and just all in all out of one sheet may get enough for 3 nails. Once I got them on and cleared coated them it was 3 hours later. And they came off while sleeping. So I tried again took about the same amount of time. Did the same thing. I moved to nail glue. Did it all over again but put just a dap of the glue, after that was dry clear coated them. Needless to Sat I gave them to my daughter to play with. Would make for a alright stocking stuffer for a teen.</li>
            <li> I LOVED THIS product so much,  I ordered more. HIGHLY RECOMMEND ;-)</li>
            <li> Smells terrible. It was so strong that I was worried the odor was toxic for me.  I threw it away.</li>
            <li> the stickers are hard to get off the sheet without ripping them</li>
            <li> Love this product even little fingers to 👌</li>
            <li> Recommend to deal with it</li>
            <li> They were better than I thought they would be.</li>
            <li> It is worth the price. Not amazing, but not too bad either. I did like the variety and the white ornaments are just wow. They do look really good. The color ones not too good, but maybe it&#x27;s just me. Also there are so many of them. Really really a lot! The reason way I gave only 3 stars is the smell, which is terrible and the length they stay on nails: It is hard to keep them on - you need a lot of coating on top. Also make sure your nails are fully dry and not tacky at all, otherwise you will not put them on. I placed white ones on the regular nail polish and they stayed for as long as nail polish stayed, but when I placed black ones on the nail polish with a little glitter for some reason, they did not lasted at all. Maybe nail surface should be smooth and even. Anyway, I am not disappointing.</li>
            <li> The stickers was nice and worth to get I liked it. Would buy again.</li>
            <li> not to bad, nice designs but half fall apart when getting them off the sheet</li>
            <li> I received  them before they said I would. The designs are cute and I didn&#x27;t receive  any 2 of the same sheet. So the reason for the 4 stars is that  they do have a smell. I let them air out some and that seemed to help a little bit. But overall not bad for the price.</li>
            <li> Good productos for a really cheap price</li>
            <li> Great quality for the price! I&#x27;ve used many of these and have not been disappointed. There&#x27;s a nice variety of designs, they&#x27;re easy to apply and they&#x27;re long lasting.</li>
            <li> These stickers are exactly what I was looking for and the price was right. Thank you very much.</li>
            <li> They were very pretty but they only give u one half of a sheet so if u want to make all your nails match you will not have enough of the white flower stickers to do both hands.  Maybe a couple fingers but not the same design.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews about them having a strange smell and didn&#x27;t really think much of it.. but dang they SERIOUSLY have a horr</li>
            <li> Well worth the price.</li>
            <li> It cheap so easily. :(</li>
            <li> little hard to peel, but overall very good for its price</li>
            <li> There are lots of decals to choose from, I&#x27;m impressed. I have had people ask me where I had purchased these.</li>
            <li> Lots of designs including glow in the dark and some with small rhinestones in them.&lt;br /&gt;Some designs look sloppy (color misaligned with outlines, random designs - fences??).&lt;br /&gt;Shipped poorly - sheets weren&#x27;t all facing the same direction so some stickers were lost when they stuck to each other, smooshed, and couldn&#x27;t be separated.&lt;br /&gt;Some of these would be really cute on kids nails - fun, cartoon-like designs.</li>
            <li> I received mine earlier then expected.  I got all 50 they are very pretty and all in perfect condition.  The sheets are small though but I think its worth it. Would buy again.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these!!!  So cute!</li>
            <li> These were cute and there are a lot of stickers, but there are several pages that are just mustaches and tobacco pipes which I thought was a little strange. Other than that these are really cute and a great price.</li>
            <li> good price, the polish has to be dry or they will curl.  you have to be careful when you take them off the plastic cause they want to break but overall they are fine</li>
            <li> They arrived much later than I expected and there is such a strong chemical odor with these stickers, I&#x27;m not sure that I even want to keep them. Also, the adhesive is hard to get off after they have been on your nails for a few days but thats probably normal with any of these types of products. Overall, they&#x27;re ok but I&#x27;m giving them 2 stars because of how long it took to ship them.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love them!!! I&#x27;m having so much fun with all of the different designs! Stick one on your nail, brush on a clear coat of polish and you&#x27;re done! :)</li>
            <li> These stickers were a hit with me. There is a wonderful selection of black, white or colored stickers. They take a little longer to get here but are well worth the wait. The price was unbelievable. They are a nice size for my nails not too big.</li>
            <li> I have not used these yet.  But the description is accurate and for the price, I was taking a chance.  There are some really cute designs.  I use nail stickers a lot and these are just as good as more expensive products.</li>
            <li> This is worth the money you spend i love them and theres so many you wont need to buy more because there is so many!</li>
            <li> Great item lots to choose from</li>
            <li> Most of the stickers rip when trying to remove them from the sheets so you have to be REALLY careful but once on the nail they stick well. I wish the colored stickers had a few larger options like the white do but overall I&#x27;ve enjoyed the product.</li>
            <li> Nice design&#x27;s good colors good deal :)</li>
            <li> Many choices--all good.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t care for this item.  The designs are extremely small and they don&#x27;t stay on your nail.</li>
            <li> Awesome product. Great price. Large selection.</li>
            <li> Awesome stickers! Had a bit of trouble receiving the item, but shop owner was very understanding &amp; helpful and shipped another free of charge! Would buy it again! Very worth it !</li>
            <li> Got more then I asked for.</li>
            <li> Huge collection, love all the pcs but some do break easily and not come off the sheet very well therefore unusable.</li>
            <li> it peels off the nail very quickly even when applying a top coat, otherwise its okay</li>
            <li> The images are blurry. Do not recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> Awesome deal! You get a ton of cute stickers with many different colors and designs all for a great price.</li>
            <li> others have mentioned that these tear easily, and they do.  they are, however, cheap and there are tons of them.  i got exactly what was advertised and there isn&#x27;t a duplicate sheet in the bunch, though some sheets have the same shapes, just in different combinations.  if you like flowers and weird frilly things, these are for you.  i use an exacto knife to get them off the sheets and my tweezer fingernails to position them.</li>
            <li> aprox 2x3 sheets, is perfect ! my 6 year old will love them! is exactly whats shown here, will fit on tiny nails all stickers under 1/4&#x27; diamiter, came in about 2 weeks! live in california. good assortment as pictured!</li>
            <li> beautyful lots of decals to choose from</li>
            <li> Love these. Very easy to peel and apply stickers to really polish off a nail look. Add just a sticker to a French manicure and it adds that extra touch of fancy and cute!! It comes with lots of choices and stickers.</li>
            <li> ..These nail art stickers r ok they come off ok u have to use tweezers to get them off and when u put the stickers on your nail they only last 24 hrs b 4 they start chipping off.. There isn&#x27;t much variety in the the batch I think the patterns repeat very often ... but for the price u get what u pay for I guess cheap price cheap product.. and they come from China so it took like 6 weeks to get to my house..</li>
            <li> the stickers are very flimsy. they tear a lot when trying to get them off the sheet or place them on the nail. mostly beautiful designs, some a bit too large.</li>
            <li> If you do your nails a lot, this is a good deal. I like to hand paint pictures on my nails, but sometimes I like being able to have the flowers or what not on my nails with out having to take the time to hand paint them. These decals are pretty good. There is a wide verity of black, white, and colored. Some of the white decals are nice and big. If you have long nails, these are great. The only reason I&#x27;m giving these four stars is some of the colored decals look a little pixelated. It just kinda looks cheap to me. Next time I buy decals I might just buy black or white ones.</li>
            <li> For the price I paid they are worth the buy. Bought them for my daughter who love&#x27;s to do her nails. All different sheets. .. Got them before the time said. Love them... Good for play time. As far as them lasting long. They don&#x27;t.... Then again I haven&#x27;t found any decorative stickers that last long on nails. Either way cheap fun stickers</li>
            <li> The designs are great.  I&#x27;m disappointed that the decals are so difficult to get off the sheet.  I ruined 6 before I figured out how to get them off in one piece.  It takes a lot of time and patience and a razor blade.  I&#x27;ve never had this much trouble with decals!</li>
            <li> there ok for the kids to use, they are happy with them.</li>
            <li> This was well worth the price.  Product arrived as pictured.  It did take a few weeks to get them, but it was worth the wait.  I recommend applying a coat of clear polish over the stickers.</li>
            <li> I love these art sticker decal tips for your nails they are amazing. it&#x27;s very colorful and many different patterns</li>
            <li> So many designs to choose from.  Having a lot of fun designing my own nails.  My niece and her friends are having fun also.</li>
            <li> I should have paid closer attention to what I was ordering. I looked at these, read the reviews and passed the first time then added them at the last minute to my order because they were so cheap. I wish I hadn&#x27;t. First, they have an awful odor to them. Maybe its the glue. Second, they were packaged poorly. All the sheets were connected but folded in on top of each other to make one big sheet. No plastic between them. So... when you pull them apart the stick to each other!!! I ruined like four sheets trying to get them apart. Now, it is summer. Maybe they became hot in transit and this happened on accident, but I still feel they should have put SOMETHING there to prevent that!! I received an order from another company the day before and they placed a plastic sheet between them and they were fine. And lastly, I was not happy with the selection I received. I expect some differences from the product pictured but this was way off from what was described. I received 20 white sheets and the rest were colored flowers.... ONE design just different colors and even that was repeated. NO black at all. White and 30 of the same flower in a few different colors. I am not pleased .I will attempt to use these (if I can get them off the backing without ripping which is another customer complaint) but will not order again no matter how cheap. I guess you really do get what you pay for. Don&#x27;t say you were not warned.</li>
            <li> Although the sheets smell sort of funky the price is unbeatable. there is alot of selection with the stickers and im happy with this product.</li>
            <li> The product did not come exactly as advertised which is disappointing but the price for all these stickers is fair so this fact doesn&#x27;t upset me too much. Advertised is 14 sheets white stickers, 15 sheets black stickers, and 22 sheets of multicolor stickers. WhatI received instead was 8 sheets of white stickers, 4 sheets of silver stickers, 9 sheets of black and white stickers, 7 sheets of black stickers, 11 sheets of black and multicolor stickers, 8 sheets of multicolor stickers and 3 sheets of white &amp;#34;french tip&amp;#34; stickers. I&#x27;m not TOO  fond of some of these stickers, especially the &amp;#34;french tip&amp;#34; stickers because it would require that my nails be exatly the same shape as the stickers for me to use them. Being a student and using my hands a lot, I cannot grow my nails out THAT long. I also dont like some stickers that look like a bar because some I&#x27;d have to trip to put across my nail and some I just don&#x27;t know how to make look nice on my nail. I suppose this latter issue just requires a bit more creativity on my part. At a local store (Walmart, CVS, Walgreens, etc) I know these stickers would cost more and the designs wouldn&#x27;t be to my liking, so these issues I raise are not that big of a deal. I just wanted other buyers to know JUST IN CASE it may be a big deal to you.  At least I did receive a total of 50 sheets, so I wasn&#x27;t short-changed. I like it. I&#x27;d buy it again.</li>
            <li> My sister and daughter love these be careful when peeling it off because it will tear abd work best on dry nails with a clear coat over it so it won&#x27;t come off</li>
            <li> Got the order a little over a week which was sooner than expected coming from Thailand. I happened to have ordered 2 sets by accident. One set had OK designs and the other had repeating design with the same color scheme and they were not pretty at all. I guess with the mixed reviews on this product is because it depends on the packet they actually decide to send you. I got 2 different packets thankfully but the images are not the best. Mostly tips/fences/flowers and multi-colored. It was not an even 14 white, 14 black, and 22 color. Instead of a few white I got colorful angry birds, and 2 or 3 all gold sheets with logos like LV as designs. Overall Not impressed, I am sure I can make use of some of them but i&#x27;ve gotten packets from other sources with better stickers. They did ship very quick so I gave them a 3.</li>
            <li> so many and my daughter loves them all!</li>
            <li> So many designs.  We have been having a lot of fun with these stickers.  They arrived quickly and all in perfect condition</li>
            <li> Patterns are cute and you get a lot of them, but the stickers are somewhat flimsy and hard to remove without tearing them, and the coloured ones all seem to have their dyes a bit displaced so it just kind of ends up looking a mess. Also for some reason the pack I received stinks of plastic solvent - like the kind of smell you think you might get cancer if you breathe it in too long, you know? It&#x27;s really off-putting and makes me wary to use/handle these too often lest I come down with some sort of chemical poisoning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price, though, you do get a lot of cute patterns. Especially in the black and white stickers; I like the roses and butterflies the best. Durability once they&#x27;re on your nails is about the same as any other decal, just use a good top coat. If you&#x27;re good with a pair of tweezers to get the stickers off without ripping, and you don&#x27;t mind the room reeking of chemical death when you use these (and I mean seriously, it&#x27;s powerful - I&#x27;ve worked in industrial mining laboratories that didn&#x27;t smell half this strong and we were using pure ammonium hydroxide!), then these are worth the couple bucks. Just be sure to follow good ventilation practices and ALWAYS use a quality base and topcoat.</li>
            <li> These are perfect! They are thinner but they sick very well to my nails. They are a nice size for my fingers. Just have to be careful when removeing. They tear easy. But once they are on i can get about a week with a good top coat. Im a cosmetologist so im using my hands all day.</li>
            <li> These are decent decals.  You can&#x27;t beat the price.  You do have to be real careful when removing the decals because they will tear.  Remember these were cheap, but once you master it... it&#x27;s well worth the money.  This is the second time I ordered this product.  I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll order again.</li>
            <li> I am giving this item 1 star only because it is as pictured, but you end up tearing most of the decals trying to remove them from the sheets so I ended up throwing them in the garbage.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
            <li> The stickers are nice and pretty.  They are just like advertised, but there is one very important flaw.  The stickers are very treatable.  It is hard to get a sticker out without something tearing, it can be done but it&#x27;s very difficult.</li>
            <li> Fantastic value assortment!  Great gift item, my girl loved the variety.  Some she liked, some she didn&#x27;t, but at this price you can&#x27;t go wrong.  There were a range of colors, some seasonal stuff like Santas, flowers, designs, a great variety.  Most are very &amp;#34;girlish&amp;#34; so fantastic for younger girls, but also some more sophisticated designs too.</li>
            <li> What I got didn&#x27;t match the item description 100%, but it was close.  I got 50 sheets of nail stickers.  Each sheet was pretty small, maybe 2 by 2.5 or 2 by 3 inches (I didn&#x27;t measure so I&#x27;m just guessing, and all of them were the same size).  I got 15 sheets of white stickers, 15 sheets of black and white stickers (sometimes all-black and all-white stickers on the same sheet, sometimes a sticker that had both black and white areas), and 20 sheets of colored stickers.  48 of the sheets were thick, rigid, clear plastic and 2 of them had a white, papery backing instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Designs ranged from hearts, butterflies, and flowers to musical notes and Halloween stickers (only 2 sheets of those).  There were a few that were not to my taste, but these were cheap and I expected that.  I don&#x27;t know if they were all different because I didn&#x27;t compare every sheet to every other sheet.  One thing I like about the clear plastic backing is that you can hold the sheets over your nail and make sure a given sticker will fit, or decide on the position you want it to be in before applying it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most of the stickers are pretty small, some even small enough for use on a child (hey, my sister gets my 2- and 4-year-old nieces&#x27; nails done).  I did not get any French tip-style pieces, which is fine by me as I don&#x27;t really like that look.  I did get a few stickers that seem designed to go at the end of rather long nails.  I&#x27;ll probably never be able to use those because my nails are unlikely to ever be the right size and shape.  But again, those made up only a small percentage of the total.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OK, on to using these.  I did not find them terribly difficult to get off the sheets.  What I did was choose the stickers I would use and remove those from the sheet before painting my nails.  I would bend the sheet and slip my fingernail under the sticker I wanted, then remove it all the way with tweezers.  I stuck the stickers to the table with most of the sticker hanging off -- the idea being that I could then grab the stickers easily with tweezers when I was ready to use them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mostly, this worked.  I ripped one (but the sheet had a few duplicates, so I just took another one like it and used it instead).  I painted my nails (no base coat, although I doubt that matters) with two pretty thick coats of a Julep polish.  When it was dry to the touch, I placed the stickers using tweezers.  These adhered to my nails pretty well, without the possibility of being easily moved, so be careful to get them in the position you want the first time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After putting all the stickers on, I followed up with 2 coats of a Seche Vite quick-dry topcoat.  It&#x27;s been about two days and the stickers are almost completely intact; maybe one or two petals on the flowers I chose have come off.  But you can&#x27;t tell unless you look closely.  None of the stickers have fallen off or have come loose.  Even with topcoat, my nails are not 100% smooth where the stickers are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the end, I&#x27;m basically happy with these.  I&#x27;ll definitely get enough use out of them to justify the cost.  They&#x27;re not without a few problems, but overall I&#x27;m satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note: You will likely have to wait more than 3 weeks for these to arrive, so if you intend to give them as a gift or use them for some occasion, order well in advance.

            <li> Every sheet is very pretty. I also like the fact that they are self adhesive. Easy to remove from the sheet, I think tweezers help with placement on the nail. Still need a top coat to keep it on the nail longer.</li>
            <li> All my friends love the stickers..worth to buy</li>
            <li> I like to do my own manis and pedis.&lt;br /&gt;These stickers are super cute and make it a cinch.&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s quite an amazing variety for such an affordable price.</li>
            <li> I really like them and plan to buy more</li>
            <li> honestly i did not like most of the designs. they were good though, just not for me. but i did love maybe ten of the sheets and may end up buying this product again just to get them again. thank you. expecially when normally would cost 5 dollars for just 6 sheets in a store. verse the 50, i can just give the extra to a relative. &amp;#60;3 thanks for the product.</li>
            <li> Cheap! Peel and break off super fast!</li>
            <li> Not sure how one is supposed to get the stickers off the page without tearing them. I have always used a set of tweezers when using nail stickers so I really dont understand why these are so defective. Very pretty though.</li>
            <li> Perfect size and prints are clear.. I can&#x27;t wait to try them out. Already have client wanting them on her nails</li>
            <li> Difficult to get the stickers off without mangling them. Nice designs</li>
            <li> Really fun designs....</li>
            <li> The sheets are cute and just what i thought they would be! It said it wouldn&#x27;t get here until almost 3 weeks from now and i was pleasantly surprised to receive it so early. I can&#x27;t wait to design my nails with these sheets in the future.</li>
            <li> Very fun stickers - great for nails, both fingers and toes! The sticker material is VERY delicate and will tear if you&#x27;re not careful. I recommend removing them with tweezers and making sure you put a clear coat over the top of the sticker so it doesn&#x27;t wear off as easily.</li>
            <li> The decals break easily when trying to lift them of the sheet.&lt;br /&gt;They are all pretty similar in design, not much variety</li>
            <li> The designs were cute had to push to make them stick a good deal my tip&lt;br /&gt;Apply push down&lt;br /&gt;Apply sally &amp; hansen instant dry clear polish imediately.&lt;br /&gt;Designs stay on apply 1 more coat to seal</li>
            <li> These stickers are absolutely perfect for cute designs on your nails A-LOT easier than trying to paint designs on your nails. The white and black stickers are as expected but the multi-colored ones are not the same as in the picture posted I only received ones that are a light blue and pink not the random colors like in the picture. I would buy it again though if the multi-color stickers where corrected.</li>
            <li> Absolutely loved these decals, works great with tweezers to apply to nails and a great buy for the price!</li>
            <li> They are really cute... BUT took a long time to arrive and  they break when you try to peel them off.. Of all i tried so far one out of every 5 came off in one piece... Kind of a bummer...</li>
            <li> Holy stickers! There are so many! I will defiantly buy again! They are way cute and the colors are bright! Really good value.</li>
            <li> All 50 sheets with no duplicate.</li>
            <li> Great quality! Great designs and there are so many of them! I love it! very happy with the purchase!</li>
            <li> I finally received my item. customs takes forever, they came from China  but once the stickers arrived I have to say that they are cute designs and a lot of them. I have not tried them but they seem to be the same as you would get at the beauty supply stores.</li>
            <li> You get a lot of stickers for your money. I have paid the same amount for only a few sheets. They do smell a little of moth balls or something, but it wasn&#x27;t horrible. None of mine were stuck together as some of the other reviews have stated. I will use most of these, I think. The white and black ones are my favorite. Some of the flower ones look a little cheesy and kid-ish, but I will use those on my nieces&#x27; toes. Only 3-4 sheets out of the 50 seem impractical for me. For the reviewers that said they peel of your nails easily, I had no problem with mine after I sealed them down with a few layers of top coat. I do this with all types of nail decals. Works like a charm. These arrived about two weeks ahead of schedule. I am very satisfied with my purchase. I took one star off for the several sheets I found to be impractical. Overall, I would totally recommend this to anyone that likes to do their own nails.</li>
            <li> Oddly, I ordered what I thought were completely different sets of decals from two different distributors, and I received two of the same 50-sheet sets. Since they are all the same, my review is the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received these about 3 weeks after placing the order.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, they had a funny odor. Second, it is difficult to remove a decal from the plastic without ripping it. I tried using tweezers, toothpicks, anything I could find but ended up ruining more than I was able to put on. Lastly, they fall off. I put them on over my dried bottom coat/color, and then put on TWO top coats and they came off the next day in the shower. It&#x27;s like the top coat didn&#x27;t matter. I wonder if there is some sort of oil that prevents the top coat from covering them?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very unhappy and disappointed because the decals are very cute and versatile. I was going to give some to my niece since there are so many, but they don&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> Good variety; lots of designs to choose from.</li>
            <li> This is the best few dollars I&#x27;ve spent on my nails this year! A few sheets I wouldn&#x27;t wear, but maybe you would ;- ) I layer the flowers to make bouquets and it works out great.</li>
            <li> This was a gift and the recipient thoroughly enjoyed it.</li>
            <li> arrived so quickly &amp; they&#x27;re so cute!! (: I kind of want some now</li>
            <li> they didn&#x27;t turn out how presented but they were still really cute , it&#x27;s worth it .</li>
            <li> so far very impressed. Only issue is that bigger decals seem to tear. Easiest to remove if you &#x27;fold&#x27; up a bit then grab with tweezers. double up on top coat. no nail glue needed.</li>
            <li> Nice small adhesive decals.  Plenty of choice to make the design your own.</li>
            <li> Got this in the mail today 2 weeks earlier than expected.  Love that there are black white and colored choices. Ordered these for my nieces. They are small enough to fit on little fingers. Got a free gift of French tip stickers also. Very satisfied.</li>
            <li> Very nice product. Works well!</li>
            <li> They look so nice on the nails.</li>
            <li> I will be getting more soon as I can. I love and will be telling all my friends about them.</li>
            <li> I like these stickers &amp; it looks like I will be able to use them all (some look like they are good for halloween, but other than that they are genetic designs). I only wish that they had a variety of color, like purple, blue, ect.</li>
            <li> I love these. Everyone is asking me where I got my nails done. They are a bit tricky getting off the sheets and putting on nails. I use tweezers and this helps alot.</li>
            <li> Very cute and came much sooner than expected! There&#x27;s so many designs to choose from I was able to give a bunch to my daughter and still have enough for tons of my own manicures. Add in the price and I couldn&#x27;t be happier</li>
            <li> They smell really bad.</li>
            <li> The designs on these are really cute and there are tons. Unfortunately they do not last - I realize they are really inexpensive and so they are ok for what you pay, I guess. But it&#x27;s a bummer because even using high quality nail polish and top coat (Out the Door or Seche Vite) they wear off after a day or two. I have other nail art stickers that I have purchased at the drugstore that last forever with a good top coat, so I&#x27;ll probably stick with those next time!</li>
            <li> Nice Designs EZ  and quick to put on</li>
            <li> Received my package of stickers today. As depicted in pictures they&#x27;re really are thousands of stickers to choose from. Finging matching sets on certain stencils may be a little hectic but stickers are gorgeous. U Who literally have hundreds of stickers to choose from it&#x27;s beyond great!  Only con and my reason for giving four stars is stickers are extremely fragile and must be lifted off stencil with extreme caution! But with so many to choose from loosing. one or two stickers here or there might not be a problem. They also stick well and don&#x27;t raise up. I recommend a topcoat after placing.</li>
            <li> What adorable designs! Took a long time to receive them, but in the end, it&#x27;s worth it because you cannot find these designs anywhere in local stores in the US.</li>
            <li> Love these cute sticker!</li>
            <li> They are nice, but could use a nicer assortment of colors. Also larger assortment of stickers to many the same. Look nice on. The ones I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I like them, but they tear easily when you remove them from the sheet</li>
            <li> Instructions are not included with item.</li>
            <li> Amazing i love all the designs</li>
            <li> Is nice producto im happy</li>
            <li> I am really glad i took a chance on these, i was a little leary after reading all the bad reviews but decided i was sick of paying $4.99 for a pack of 3 at wal mart or sally&#x27;s. So it took a looooong time to receive my package but whn i did i pulled the sheets out right away (they did smell strange) but i will tell you this I am in love with these stickers i have one on each ring finger as i type this :) my sheets came with an awesome variety some had little mustaches so the girls at work put them on their first fingers and would hod it over their lip (super fun) some where big flowers, hearts, cute dainty swirl designs i received way more black sheets &amp; white sheets than colored but i was ok with that. I have ordered 2 more sets because yes (they smelled strange) &amp; yes (some tore) but not enough to make a significant difference in count, some stickers even had the small pretty jewels attached so jic this seller decides to pull this product im stocking up, &amp; i use them with uv gel polish so mine last for weeks not sure about regular top coat.</li>
            <li> There are so many of them! Be careful though because they like to split while your taking them off.</li>
            <li> I only got the black &amp;white stickers no color -___-</li>
            <li> These are exactly what I was looking for, and you can&#x27;t beat the price. A lot of the designs have weaved/checkered styles, and I can&#x27;t see myself using any of those. However the rest of the flower, star, swirl, and holiday designs are really cute. They stick perfectly to the nail/nail polish, and with a clear coat over it, they last for several weeks.</li>
            <li> I like these but they do not lift off as easy as I hoped.</li>
            <li> Love these they will make doing nails a lot easier and now my sister is jealous and wants some!</li>
            <li> use these occasionally  my techniction does better</li>
            <li> I love this nails stickers</li>
            <li> Very nice! Easy to put, a lot of choises</li>
            <li> Each sheet is a different style so you can get a number of different looks out of this one set.  The stickers are great quality and stick well so you can make a number of styles and looks.  Would recommend to anyone that enjoys doing nail art; you can use these to create a fun, flirty look or something more classy for a more formal occasion</li>
            <li> The black ones doesn&#x27;t come up in one piece. The multicolor ones are coming up from my nails. The whites are the best of the worst. Do not spend your money on this....</li>
            <li> you sure get a lot for the money but i noticed a lot of them rip when you are trying to peel them off the paper. once on the nail they are fine but you do waste a few to get them off the paper.</li>
            <li> I like This product a lot. Thanks. Faster delivery even when come in from Tailandia. I m so apply with my stickers mi my work everybody like ti.</li>
            <li> There were a lot of cute and different and colorful stickers.</li>
            <li> I ordered these and I got a pair of ANKLE WARMERS!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> bought them for my daughter. she loves them. they are tiny and fint her lettle fingers.</li>
            <li> I loved that you get so many for cheap but you get what you pay for every time I try to peel one off it rips.</li>
            <li> These don&#x27;t stick very good. They keep coming off. I threw them out.</li>
            <li> These decals are so much cheaper and so many more styles, than you can buy from a beauty supplier.</li>
            <li> Had a bad weird smell for days when you first open packaging, the colored ones do have a digital look to them</li>
            <li> These are great! They stick on and stay on. They are even a little raised/3D and they still stay on. The silver and gold ones look really elegant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Caution on two things. I would use a tool and still be careful when placing them on your nail, because as I said they stick very well and they won&#x27;t budge once they have been put down. The other caution is once you have placed all the stickers you are going to and want to finish off with a clear top coat, make sure to go over the stickered areas as little as possible as it will take off coloring with multiple strokes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that I really like these and hope to get more designs!</li>
            <li> Bought for my daughter who begged for them.  The stickers are fine and don&#x27;t themselves seem to reek on my daughter&#x27;s polished nails.  But the smell is/was horrible upon opening.  I figure it&#x27;s from the stickers and/or the plastic of the packaging and being enclosed for so long.  We had to air out the room, it was that awful.  (Don&#x27;t know if the smell is gone now from the whole lot as I&#x27;ve no desire to check and submit my nose to that dreadful smell.)</li>
            <li> The stickers are from China, I should&#x27;ve known.  When you try to peel a sticker off, it cracks, or peels off half the sticker....pay a little more, and don&#x27;t buy these....</li>
            <li> Took awhile to arrive but there are so many colors and cute stickers to choose from it&#x27;s worth the wait! I didn&#x27;t have an applicator so I had trouble applying the stickers to my nails at first but after getting the right stuff it&#x27;s easy. Love them, still have a ton left.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THESE SHEETS OF STICKERS, they are wonderful. I got more sheets of nail stickers cheaper than buying them locally. They are beautiful white, black and color ones. I&#x27;m looking forward to using them. I can mix and match easily with all the choices I have. Thank you! I will most likely buy more if I run out of these.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical a first due to the price, but it turns out that I had nothing to worry about. I thought they were going to be really ugly or very cheaply made but I was wrong. I mean don&#x27;t get me wrong they aren&#x27;t the best quality, but you just can&#x27;t beat the price. Just remove them carefully from the plastic and you&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
            <li> Very happy!  There are so many cool designs.  I don&#x27;t know if I could even use them all.  Shipping was fast and easy.</li>
            <li> So many choices I am now changing my nail polish every day, there is nothing funner than having so many choices and being able to do this at home!  I get so many compliments and they are my own nails, and I have so much fun doing this my self.  There are 50 sheets in this kit, and these were NOT expensive at all!!  I was very impressed with the choices!!!  Thank you so much for selling these.</li>
            <li> The sticker sheets didn&#x27;t have matching stickers, they were very fragile and tore even if you were able to get a hold of one, then you had to search dozens of different sheets to find one to match. Very disappointed in product and I order on line constantly and I will not be buying this product again</li>
            <li> Was excited to get these but it sucks trying to peel them off with out tearing them. Guess that&#x27;s why they were so cheap.</li>
            <li> You only get floral decals .. White multicolored and a black set. No cartoon characters as shown in pics</li>
            <li> So much for the price. Great designs, colors. I love them. I will buy again when I run out. My girls love them also.</li>
            <li> I received the 50 sheets, some bright colors with flowers and other girly designs, some sheet of the glow in the dark and some of the black with sparkles. Mostly all flowers, did not get any of the french tip ones as other reviewers did. They got here much faster than the estimated arrival date. I find them very easy to remove from the backing to place on my nails. (Make sure you are putting them on completely dry nail polish or they will curl)&lt;br /&gt;As another reviewer stated, they do smell, very badly of chemicals. I have had them airing out for two days now and they still reek of gross strong chemical smell.&lt;br /&gt;All in all, a good buy, fair price, decent shipping time.</li>
            <li> This was a pleasant surprise! Tons of stickers in really cute styles! Even had some skulls...very pleased. They look really cute and even on my natural nails they stay put.</li>
            <li> Nice designs and pretty</li>
            <li> WOW, if you are looking for a LOT of nail art stickers...........You get 20 sheets of colored designs, 15 sheets of black and 15 white.  The designs on each sheet range depending upon the size of the designs from 15 to 20 per sheet of the larger designs to 80 - 100 per sheet of the tiny designs.  There is a good variety of designs, I received a lot of flowers, filigree, stars, dot stripes, roses(very pretty white roses), butterflies, dragonflies, hearts and more (even one sheet with some little holly sprigs on it!).  The Black ones and White ones were my favorite but only because many of these already have tiny little rhinestones on the design or in center of flower, etc.  The colored designs are all sorts of colors from soft to bold and bright. Some of the colors are Blues, pinks (bright and light), yellow, gold, green, red, purple, etc. The colored flowers are very pretty on especially if you want to add a tiny Rhinestone or stud to the center ( I prefer that these do not have the rhinestones already on them so I can use a color of my choice).</li>
            <li> I loved them....except the colored stickers seamed like they were for little girls.....and they dont stick very well so luckily i have uv gel clear coat  to permanently place it on my nail with out any snagging....i wouldnt recommend  buying if you cant seel the sticker onto your nail..</li>
            <li> Great styles, lot&#x27;s of variety.  Would buy again.</li>
            <li> I like the stickers, but they are really hard to peel off without tearing them, plus the rub off within a week.</li>
            <li> The decals are good, not great.  The clear ones are very delicate and tear easily.  The black and colored ones are a bit better and look great on even clear painted nails.</li>
            <li> Love the decals. They were everything I had hoped for. Great purchase I would recommend there were not duplicate sheets either.</li>
            <li> Very hard to keep each sticker from breaking.  A nice variety but some stickers break when peeling from the sheet.  Too fragile</li>
            <li> Cute and easy to use, def worth the price!</li>
            <li> They are soo pretty I really like them.</li>
            <li> So awesome, i received 50 sheets of stickers and theres a variety of designs so i can use to add to my nails such as bows,  flowers,  brand logos such as dior and chanel, and other stickers!</li>
            <li> Better quality than expected.  Would purchase again.</li>
            <li> Love these sticker.. beautiful variety. Will be buying so much more of these.. they are simple to do and suprisingly out last my nail polish everytime:) super score on the price too.. I live in maui and for one sheet of these decals is 5.00$+  :o I&#x27;m a satisfyed customer:)</li>
            <li> The colors and the design are not that good half of theme doesn&#x27;t look real they just look like kids stickers, but you can have fun with theme. Not really for a date work days maybe</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe all the designs! Great deal!</li>
            <li> came before they were expected too. have tons of different sheets, just wish they had included different designs as some as very similar.</li>
            <li> So I ordered two different sets of nail decals from two different sellers and they are identical.  Weird, and a little disappointing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The set I received is all flowers, with maybe two or three sheets of butterflies thrown in.  This is particularly disappointing, because I was expecting at least some variation.  I did get lots of black and white sheets, but the multicolored ones are all pastel and not nearly so vibrant as the photos led me to believe.  It&#x27;s all yellow and pink, and lavender.  The colored stickers are kind of ugly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I may use a few of them on my nails, but a very large portion will be going to my friends 5 year old daughter, I&#x27;m sure she&#x27;ll love them.</li>
            <li> Shipping was very quick decals dont stick to well but love all the color flowets</li>
            <li> More then half of these ripped to pieces when taking them off their sheets. But there are a lot of them so still getting use out of them</li>
            <li> nice..but very hard to get of sheet..broke alot of them just trying to get them off..wouldnt buy again..sorry</li>
            <li> TONS AND TONS of super cute stickers!</li>
            <li> The sheets are small, but the decals are cute, sparkly, and just the right size for even the smallest nails. Absolutely great quality for the price.</li>
            <li> They are really cute but then I try to put them on nails and they just keep ripping appart!!</li>
            <li> Cute - Totally what I expected. Price was way better than picking them up at the Drugstore. Great for accent nail designs. Got a variety of white, black, and multi. The multi could have been a better mix compared to what other reviewers received. The sizes are good, some are too long for my nails, but I can cut as needed and still use them, anyways I&#x27;m happy.</li>
            <li> These are great, very nice quality</li>
            <li> so many sheets for so little price and so pretty I love it I definitely will order again!!</li>
            <li> Very low quality, the sticker does peels off very badly and tears. I will not recommend this. im really disappointed with this nail art :/</li>
            <li> Had a terrible time trying to get these off the package without them ripping apart.  I finally gave up on all but the simplest design for a single flower.</li>
            <li> Lots of pages of stickers, way more than I ever expected!  Not in any kind of order, not organized at all.  The only complaint I have and the only reason I didn&#x27;t give the product 4 or 5 stars is because it took a very long time to arrive, and it smells very bad.  The bag with the stickers smells heavily of gasoline or paint, a terrible odor.  Other than that awful little tidbit of information, the stickers seem to be very good quality.</li>
            <li> I loved!! It&#x27;s really easy to use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had so much fun with these decals! They stay on well and look great!</li>
            <li> Very nice variety. Easy to apply.</li>
            <li> These are rad and priced very well. Super easy to use!</li>
            <li> So may choices love it</li>
            <li> Did not receive the whole 50sheets as stated</li>
            <li> My younger sister loves stuff like this so she&#x27;s definitely happy about it.</li>
            <li> Not disappointed!  Very great for the price and a great variety!</li>
            <li> Love it...would buy again from them...</li>
            <li> perfect and easy to work with&lt;br /&gt;thanks&lt;br /&gt;well packed&lt;br /&gt;thanks</li>
            <li> Just about every type of nail art you could want.  Four dollars for 50 sheets is an incredible deal!</li>
            <li> Loved them. Came quickly, good variety and value</li>
            <li> I ended up receiving 49 sheets: 15 Black, 14 White and 20 Color (counted 3 times).  Even being one sheet short, that&#x27;s a LOT of nail art.  I prefer the black and white designs, the color ones look a bit too childish for my taste but still a great buy.</li>
            <li> I like all the different sheets it has but they dont stay at all i had to put glue so they will stay and even so they would come outin like two days.</li>
            <li> Love all of them!  So many, they will last me a life time. I think.</li>
            <li> Love it !&lt;br /&gt;Looks really pretty</li>
            <li> They smell horribly - definitely air them out, and don&#x27;t breathe in too closely. They are just awful! I thought I even smelled formaldehyde... but it&#x27;s just a really, really awful chemical scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My main reason for giving 3 stars instead of 4 is that they&#x27;re extremely hard to pull off of the sheet, even with tweezers. If you finally manage to do so, they last on your nails even without a top coat. You can go without a top coat if you only want to wear them for a short time, and if your fingers don&#x27;t get extremely warm - when they get warm, they do easily slide around on your nails and the glue gets goopy so it&#x27;s best to just thrown on some top coat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also wish there was more variety. There are 3... possibly 4?... designs. I got all of the types pictured but almost no black ones, and too many repeats of the same colorful ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are cheaper than you&#x27;d buy them for in a drugstore or beauty store, though - so that&#x27;s something.</li>
            <li> These stickers are really nice to apply to nails. You do get a lot of stickers. They are very pretty. But some of the stickers are not easy to remove they tear very easy. Use tweezers it helps.</li>
            <li> Shipping took a long time but that&#x27;s to be expected. This product ships from out of the country.  Product arrived as ordered and pictured.&lt;br /&gt;Be gentle removing them from the sheet. If you grab them the wrong way they will break off. Once positioned they stick to nails well.</li>
            <li> To a while to get but absolutely love them.</li>
            <li> Stickers were ok.  Not real pleased with packaging.</li>
            <li> Lots of variety.  Lots of fun!  There are some of these I won&#x27;t ever use, but there are many that I really like.  Plenty to choose from and very inexpensive!  I use them with gel nail polish, applying them just before the top coat.  I apply topcoat just in the area I will place the decal and then use my UV light then apply top coat to the entire nail and use the light again.  They usually last as long as the rest of the manicure.</li>
            <li> It was a little long getting here but well within their time period of promising it...cant beat what I got for the price so I&#x27;m happy.</li>
            <li> Did not get all the stencils, the stickers were very hard to remove and it was way expensive shipping took a couple of weeks wont be buying again .</li>
            <li> Sure get a lot of decals for the money. But they are very tiny, which makes it difficult to put on the nail. Have to make sure to use the largest ones, otherwise they look like dirty spots on your nails, even a few feet away.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love these. Such a huge variety of designs. Would definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> Arrived early.  Already tried a couple stickers out on my nails. Staying on good so far!  Cute!</li>
