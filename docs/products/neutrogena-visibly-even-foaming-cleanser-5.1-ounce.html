            <li>Another great product that the stores don&#x27;t seem to carry any more.</li>
            <li>I have been very pleased with Neutrogena Products.</li>
            <li>I think my favorite part about this product is that it has virtually stopped my breakouts!</li>
            <li>All in all, I am in love with this product!    </li>
            <li>I absolutely love it!</li>
            <li>I want to love you again!</li>
            <li>There is no harm in trying and if it works for you like it has been for me, you&#x27;ll finally be able to say that your skin is no longer your enemy!</li>
            <li>I have to say that this is an amazing product.  </li>
            <li>Thank you Neutrogena for making amazing products.</li>
            <li>This product also does not bleach the skin or give two toned look which is absolutely amazing.</li>
            <li>Has a nice scent too.</li>
            <li>Nice and foamy.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff and again, it is great to have things like this on the Amazon Subscriptions at a fantastic price and delivered!  </li>
            <li>but this does a really good job of providing an even clean look and it lathers up nicely.  </li>
            <li>This is by far the best regime for my skin combined with the Visibly Even Moisturizer.</li>
            <li>SOOO glad I did cause this stuff is seriously amazing.</li>
            <li>(this is a VERY important requirement for me, because otherwise I break out), yet isn&#x27;t drying or greasy.</li>
            <li>The scent was very light to almost non-existent,</li>
            <li>WILL ALWAYS BE MY FAVORITE CLEANSER.</li>
            <li>LOVE THE FEEL AND SEEMS TO EVEN COMPLEXION.</li>
            <li>My wife has received so many compliments about her complexion and glow since she started using this.&lt;br /&gt;Works</li>
            <li>Love.</li>
            <li>It smells great, has gentle scrubbing particles (but not too many), removes all makeup</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m so glad I was able to get it on amazon.</li>
            <li>After about two weeks I noticed that my skin tone was MUCH MORE EVEN.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know why more people don&#x27;t know about this product</li>
            <li>My latest order arrived as promised without hassle,thanks Amazon.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite beauty product, and I can no longer find it in stores.  </li>
            <li>I love, love, love this product.</li>
            <li>So yes, I love it, because it works for me.</li>
            <li>I love Neutrogena&#x27;s Visibly Even Foaming Cleanser.  </li>
            <li>I used to be able to get this product in the stores, but now I can&#x27;t find it anywhere except on-line.  </li>
            <li>So glad Amazon has it.</li>
            <li>like the foaming better than the cream style</li>
            <li>Smells ok too.</li>
            <li>Not horrible but not repurchasing.</li>
            <li>This is great - really cleans and seems to even out skin as advertised (no redness or bumpiness after use).</li>
            <li>Overall, I am very happy with this product and plan to continue using this as part of my skincare routine.</li>
            <li>Plastic microbeads and 4 parabens - lovely fragrance, though.</li>
            <li>I love this product, i have the mosturizer to it and my face stared clearing up.</li>
            <li>I love it and use it every night.  </li>
            <li>I also use the visibly even daily moisturizer, which is awesome!</li>
            <li>I love it hardcore.</li>
            <li>Instead, I will be using more animal-friendly products.</li>
            <li>I just wish it was able to remove the blemishes i have.</li>
            <li>Love it, will keep using this item...</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>I love this face wash.</li>
            <li>If you have oily skin with breakouts but have aging skin,  I would recommend using the Neutrogena Healthy Skin Anti Wrinkle Anti Blemish Cleanser.</li>
            <li>Will purchase again for sure.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this face cleanser.  </li>
            <li>However, it will effectively exfoliate, clean, smooth, and soften your skin, just what you want a cleanser to do!</li>
            <li>Decent price for a great product.  </li>
            <li>Not only does this stuff clean your face, it exfoliates, moisturizes, and best of all clears up and prevents all breakouts!!</li>
            <li>Good price fast shipping</li>
            <li>It really cleans good.</li>
            <li>Neutrogena is one of my favorite products because this line is so good for my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>but I have to be honest and say any effect this had on my skin tone came and went within the first 2 weeks of using it.</li>
            <li>I love this product I was using in the past and my face was flawless.</li>
            <li>probably from years of burning (I have a light skin tone).</li>
            <li>I think I may actually stick to this one (assuming it&#x27;s not discontinued, which always seems to be the case with great products).</li>
            <li>I really enjoy the foaming of the cleanser and the scent is light.  </li>
            <li>Something only I noticed and happily don&#x27;t see anymore.  </li>
            <li>Makes my skin so smooth that i wanna wash it over and over.</li>
            <li>haven´t experienced any irritation or dryness, but every skin is different.</li>
            <li>Regarding the dryness that some reviewers experienced, I believe that any facial routine always involves cleansing, toning and hydrating.</li>
            <li>The foaming cleanser leaves my skin, silky smooth.</li>
            <li>So far, so good.  </li>
            <li>so far so good.  </li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t comment on that, but it does keep my skin clean and free from oils yet moisturizes</li>
            <li>lather, the mild exfoliation, the smell, the lack of breaking out from it, the lack of allergic reaction, the actual skintone-evening properties... great, but I won&#x27;t be buying it again.</li>
            <li>I use it to clean my face every day and night.</li>
            <li>A bit drying but clean feel after using.  </li>
            <li>This cleanser gets your skin clean, but is a bit too drying for me.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that it doesn&#x27;t take much to apply to the face.  </li>
            <li>highly recommend this product! :)</li>
            <li>, some left a residue, most were ok but</li>
            <li>I highly recommend and would definitely buy again at this great Amazon price.</li>
            <li>Only pros was that it smells good and lathers pretty well.</li>
            <li>I love that my skin is looking better e dry week.</li>
            <li>Acne isn&#x27;t really a concern for me, but this is a great product for people with dry skin.</li>
            <li>and it helps keep my face fresh and balances the moisture on my face.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s still early so I cannot comment on the toning yet but it seems to be ok.</li>
            <li>For the price, it´s definitely worth it.</li>
            <li>My skin always feels fresh, clean, smooth, and soft after I use this cleanser.  </li>
            <li>Many of the other scrubs don&#x27;t work as well and cost more money.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many different cleansers, both high and low-end, and this is my favorite.</li>
            <li>I have combination skin and with the lotion it put the right amount of moisture on all areas of my face.  </li>
            <li>The price is right too.</li>
            <li>and it has just enough foam, goes on smoothly and washes off easily.</li>
            <li>Works nicely, haven&#x27;t used it for long but soon will update</li>
            <li>It is very gentle, but it works.</li>
            <li>It has very gentle exfoliants to help polish the skin, but also has soy and vitamin C.  </li>
            <li>It is the only one I&#x27;ve found that truly seems to exfoliate without drying out, and it truly does give my skin a more &amp;#34;even&amp;#34; tone.  </li>
            <li>It leaves your skin soft and smooth after cleansing.</li>
            <li>It got rid of most of my daily</li>
            <li>I have been able to see a difference in the overall tone of my skin.</li>
            <li>my face has never had so many breakouts than since using this face wash-which is also totally not a foaming cleanser.</li>
            <li>My face is smooth and clear.  </li>
            <li>It helps keep my skin clear and smooth.  </li>
            <li>I love this facial cleanser.</li>
            <li>they would had I not purchased this product in the first place.</li>
            <li>First and for most, I have only been using this product for 2 weeks now</li>
            <li>I was apprehensive at first after reading reviews of this product breaking others out.</li>
            <li>I love this face wash, its my daily face wash.</li>
            <li>Very creamy!</li>
            <li>but I definitely had more blackheads and zits than when I used other more seemingly effective cleansers at similar price points.</li>
            <li>This product seems to be the right combo of cleanser, exfoliation, and moisturizer (stripping my skin of too much of it&#x27;s moisture tends to cause it to overproduce oil and causes breakouts).</li>
            <li>This cleanser takes off all my makeup (I normally wear mascara, eyeshadow, and a bit of powder if I am feeling oily), and it leaves my skin feeling soft and clean!</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t do anything extra but still I love it better than other face washes I have used before.</li>
            <li>GENTLY UNTIL BEADS DISAPPEAR.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t really foam.     </li>
            <li>, I really hope that Neutrogena is not considering discontinuing this item.  </li>
            <li>This is a real review.</li>
            <li>Did absolutely nothing for my skin.</li>
            <li>I have not experienced any adverse effects, and am happy with the price.  </li>
            <li>With that said I can&#x27;t say I like this item to much.</li>
            <li>The skin looks much healthier and even.</li>
            <li>I really think people should try this one and see if it works.</li>
            <li>Since this is a cleanser and not a leave-on moisturizer, I don&#x27;t think it does much to even out skin tone.  </li>
            <li>This is by far my favorite facial cleanser from Neutrogena.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use it on a regular basis but so far I love the result and the smell of the product when you apply it.</li>
            <li>Though there is no foam, it really does clean, exfoliates, moisturizes and brightens my skin instantly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve repurchased this cleanser more than any other cleanser.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin super soft and it&#x27;s gentle on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Good night time cleanser, because it contains gentle small little beads, that do not tear your skin, giving you mild exfoliation!</li>
            <li>I always go right back to this product &amp; immediately see a positive difference.  </li>
            <li>This is certainly a 5 star product in my book, after searching for the right products I&#x27;ve finally found a line that would work just for me.  </li>
            <li>In fact it has help clear my tiny pesky breakouts and given me smooth skin.</li>
            <li>it works so much better than more expensive cleansers</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this cleanser paired with the Neutrogena Visibly Even SPF 30 Moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s exfoliating, but not harsh, and really makes my skin glow.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my face feeling clean, but not overly dry.  </li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m not a big fan of strong fragranced facial cleansers).</li>
            <li>I bought this on Amazon because it isn&#x27;t offered where I live.  </li>
            <li>but I was looking for something new (the bane of my existence).</li>
            <li>I have used a few of the Neutrogena facial cleansers and none of them are as effective as the visibly even.  </li>
            <li>I love the tiny little beads that make you feel like exfoliating is really working.  </li>
            <li>but once you wet hands and rub them together the ruff stuff is not bad and it does not scratch your face at all.</li>
            <li>I put a small amount on my facial brush and work up a nice foam</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 29 years old with combination skin and this has cleared me up without drying me out and somehow, even though you do wash it off, I swear it does make my skin more even and less red.</li>
            <li>cleanser doesn&#x27;t have many exfoliating beads, but I actually prefer that way, and this is why: for about a month and a half, I&#x27;ve been using the &amp;#34;Water-Resistant Professional Skin Care Face and Body Brush System by ToiletTree Products&amp;#34; (also bought on Amazon).</li>
            <li>This is a product that was hard for me to find in most store&#x27;s</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this with the Visibly Even Clear Moisturizer with SPF 30 during the day and the Rapid Tone Repair Moisturizer at night.</li>
            <li>My face has been completely transformed and is the softest it has ever been.</li>
            <li>I used to use more expensive cleansers which work well but who wants to spend that much money on a face wash?  </li>
            <li>Neutrogena is dissapointing lately, even though I used to love their products.</li>
            <li>and I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Soy is a natural skin brightener and Vitamin C is an anti-oxidant that can help improve the look and feel of your skin.  </li>
            <li>firstly, it doesn&#x27;t have enough exfoliating beads by a long shot.</li>
            <li>I love trying new products and occasionally &amp;#34;cheat&amp;#34; on this, but then my skin takes a turn for the worse</li>
            <li>Even at 64 years old, I can get an occasional breakout.  </li>
            <li>I am 58 years old and my dermatologist always comments on my skin - especially my face.</li>
            <li>Although it says it&#x27;s a foaming cleanser, it&#x27;s really very creamy, with minimal microbeads.  </li>
            <li>It has some type of granules in it, which do not bother me, but they were not expected.  </li>
            <li>I would have preferred something that would have left my skin feeling soft.</li>
            <li>I have combination skin and suffer from adult acne and regular breakouts, so I have to deal with marks, spots, and unevenness.</li>
            <li>After one use of both the facial wash and the lotion my skin was smoother, softer, lighter, more even, and less dark spots.  </li>
            <li>The little scrubbies in the cleanser feel smooth rather than some cleansers that have rough scrubbies and almost tear up your skin.</li>
            <li>I am a 22 year old African American girl and my skin tone has never been even.</li>
            <li>Just kept on with the half fast job for months up until tonight when I finished the bottle.</li>

            <li> I have to say that this is an amazing product.  </li>
            <li> Thank you Neutrogena for making amazing products.</li>
            <li> This product also does not bleach the skin or give two toned look which is absolutely amazing.</li>
            <li> Has a nice scent too.</li>
            <li> Nice and foamy.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff and again, it is great to have things like this on the Amazon Subscriptions at a fantastic price and delivered!  </li>
            <li> but this does a really good job of providing an even clean look and it lathers up nicely.  </li>
            <li> This is by far the best regime for my skin combined with the Visibly Even Moisturizer.</li>
            <li> SOOO glad I did cause this stuff is seriously amazing.</li>
            <li> (this is a VERY important requirement for me, because otherwise I break out), yet isn&#x27;t drying or greasy.</li>
            <li> The scent was very light to almost non-existent,</li>
            <li> WILL ALWAYS BE MY FAVORITE CLEANSER.</li>
            <li> LOVE THE FEEL AND SEEMS TO EVEN COMPLEXION.</li>
            <li> My wife has received so many compliments about her complexion and glow since she started using this.&lt;br /&gt;Works</li>
            <li> Love.</li>
            <li> It smells great, has gentle scrubbing particles (but not too many), removes all makeup</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m so glad I was able to get it on amazon.</li>
            <li> After about two weeks I noticed that my skin tone was MUCH MORE EVEN.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why more people don&#x27;t know about this product</li>
            <li> My latest order arrived as promised without hassle,thanks Amazon.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite beauty product, and I can no longer find it in stores.  </li>
            <li> I love, love, love this product.</li>
            <li> So yes, I love it, because it works for me.</li>
            <li> I love Neutrogena&#x27;s Visibly Even Foaming Cleanser.  </li>
            <li> I used to be able to get this product in the stores, but now I can&#x27;t find it anywhere except on-line.  </li>
            <li> So glad Amazon has it.</li>
            <li> like the foaming better than the cream style</li>
            <li> Smells ok too.</li>
            <li> Not horrible but not repurchasing.</li>
            <li> This is great - really cleans and seems to even out skin as advertised (no redness or bumpiness after use).</li>
            <li> Overall, I am very happy with this product and plan to continue using this as part of my skincare routine.</li>
            <li> Plastic microbeads and 4 parabens - lovely fragrance, though.</li>
            <li> I love this product, i have the mosturizer to it and my face stared clearing up.</li>
            <li> I love it and use it every night.  </li>
            <li> I also use the visibly even daily moisturizer, which is awesome!</li>
            <li> I love it hardcore.</li>
            <li> Instead, I will be using more animal-friendly products.</li>
            <li> I just wish it was able to remove the blemishes i have.</li>
            <li> Love it, will keep using this item...</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> I love this face wash.</li>
            <li> If you have oily skin with breakouts but have aging skin,  I would recommend using the Neutrogena Healthy Skin Anti Wrinkle Anti Blemish Cleanser.</li>
            <li> Will purchase again for sure.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this face cleanser.  </li>
            <li> However, it will effectively exfoliate, clean, smooth, and soften your skin, just what you want a cleanser to do!</li>
            <li> Decent price for a great product.  </li>
            <li> Not only does this stuff clean your face, it exfoliates, moisturizes, and best of all clears up and prevents all breakouts!!</li>
            <li> Good price fast shipping</li>
            <li> It really cleans good.</li>
            <li> Neutrogena is one of my favorite products because this line is so good for my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> but I have to be honest and say any effect this had on my skin tone came and went within the first 2 weeks of using it.</li>
            <li> I love this product I was using in the past and my face was flawless.</li>
            <li> probably from years of burning (I have a light skin tone).</li>
            <li> I think I may actually stick to this one (assuming it&#x27;s not discontinued, which always seems to be the case with great products).</li>
            <li> I really enjoy the foaming of the cleanser and the scent is light.  </li>
            <li> Something only I noticed and happily don&#x27;t see anymore.  </li>
            <li> Makes my skin so smooth that i wanna wash it over and over.</li>
            <li> haven´t experienced any irritation or dryness, but every skin is different.</li>
            <li> Regarding the dryness that some reviewers experienced, I believe that any facial routine always involves cleansing, toning and hydrating.</li>
            <li> The foaming cleanser leaves my skin, silky smooth.</li>
            <li> So far, so good.  </li>
            <li> so far so good.  </li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t comment on that, but it does keep my skin clean and free from oils yet moisturizes</li>
            <li> lather, the mild exfoliation, the smell, the lack of breaking out from it, the lack of allergic reaction, the actual skintone-evening properties... great, but I won&#x27;t be buying it again.</li>
            <li> I use it to clean my face every day and night.</li>
            <li> A bit drying but clean feel after using.  </li>
            <li> This cleanser gets your skin clean, but is a bit too drying for me.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that it doesn&#x27;t take much to apply to the face.  </li>
            <li> highly recommend this product! :)</li>
            <li> , some left a residue, most were ok but</li>
            <li> I highly recommend and would definitely buy again at this great Amazon price.</li>
            <li> Only pros was that it smells good and lathers pretty well.</li>
            <li> I love that my skin is looking better e dry week.</li>
            <li> Acne isn&#x27;t really a concern for me, but this is a great product for people with dry skin.</li>
            <li> and it helps keep my face fresh and balances the moisture on my face.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s still early so I cannot comment on the toning yet but it seems to be ok.</li>
            <li> For the price, it´s definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> My skin always feels fresh, clean, smooth, and soft after I use this cleanser.  </li>
            <li> Many of the other scrubs don&#x27;t work as well and cost more money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many different cleansers, both high and low-end, and this is my favorite.</li>
            <li> I have combination skin and with the lotion it put the right amount of moisture on all areas of my face.  </li>
            <li> The price is right too.</li>
            <li> and it has just enough foam, goes on smoothly and washes off easily.</li>
            <li> Works nicely, haven&#x27;t used it for long but soon will update</li>
            <li> It is very gentle, but it works.</li>
            <li> It has very gentle exfoliants to help polish the skin, but also has soy and vitamin C.  </li>
            <li> It is the only one I&#x27;ve found that truly seems to exfoliate without drying out, and it truly does give my skin a more &amp;#34;even&amp;#34; tone.  </li>
            <li> It leaves your skin soft and smooth after cleansing.</li>
            <li> It got rid of most of my daily</li>
            <li> I have been able to see a difference in the overall tone of my skin.</li>
            <li> my face has never had so many breakouts than since using this face wash-which is also totally not a foaming cleanser.</li>
            <li> My face is smooth and clear.  </li>
            <li> It helps keep my skin clear and smooth.  </li>
            <li> I love this facial cleanser.</li>
            <li> they would had I not purchased this product in the first place.</li>
            <li> First and for most, I have only been using this product for 2 weeks now</li>
            <li> I was apprehensive at first after reading reviews of this product breaking others out.</li>
            <li> I love this face wash, its my daily face wash.</li>
            <li> Very creamy!</li>
            <li> but I definitely had more blackheads and zits than when I used other more seemingly effective cleansers at similar price points.</li>
            <li> This product seems to be the right combo of cleanser, exfoliation, and moisturizer (stripping my skin of too much of it&#x27;s moisture tends to cause it to overproduce oil and causes breakouts).</li>
            <li> This cleanser takes off all my makeup (I normally wear mascara, eyeshadow, and a bit of powder if I am feeling oily), and it leaves my skin feeling soft and clean!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t do anything extra but still I love it better than other face washes I have used before.</li>
            <li> GENTLY UNTIL BEADS DISAPPEAR.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really foam.     </li>
            <li> , I really hope that Neutrogena is not considering discontinuing this item.  </li>
            <li> This is a real review.</li>
            <li> Did absolutely nothing for my skin.</li>
            <li> I have not experienced any adverse effects, and am happy with the price.  </li>
            <li> With that said I can&#x27;t say I like this item to much.</li>
            <li> The skin looks much healthier and even.</li>
            <li> I really think people should try this one and see if it works.</li>
            <li> Since this is a cleanser and not a leave-on moisturizer, I don&#x27;t think it does much to even out skin tone.  </li>
            <li> This is by far my favorite facial cleanser from Neutrogena.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use it on a regular basis but so far I love the result and the smell of the product when you apply it.</li>
            <li> Though there is no foam, it really does clean, exfoliates, moisturizes and brightens my skin instantly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve repurchased this cleanser more than any other cleanser.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin super soft and it&#x27;s gentle on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Good night time cleanser, because it contains gentle small little beads, that do not tear your skin, giving you mild exfoliation!</li>
            <li> I always go right back to this product &amp; immediately see a positive difference.  </li>
            <li> This is certainly a 5 star product in my book, after searching for the right products I&#x27;ve finally found a line that would work just for me.  </li>
            <li> In fact it has help clear my tiny pesky breakouts and given me smooth skin.</li>
            <li> it works so much better than more expensive cleansers</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this cleanser paired with the Neutrogena Visibly Even SPF 30 Moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s exfoliating, but not harsh, and really makes my skin glow.  </li>
            <li> It leaves my face feeling clean, but not overly dry.  </li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m not a big fan of strong fragranced facial cleansers).</li>
            <li> I bought this on Amazon because it isn&#x27;t offered where I live.  </li>
            <li> but I was looking for something new (the bane of my existence).</li>
            <li> I have used a few of the Neutrogena facial cleansers and none of them are as effective as the visibly even.  </li>
            <li> I love the tiny little beads that make you feel like exfoliating is really working.  </li>
            <li> but once you wet hands and rub them together the ruff stuff is not bad and it does not scratch your face at all.</li>
            <li> I put a small amount on my facial brush and work up a nice foam</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 29 years old with combination skin and this has cleared me up without drying me out and somehow, even though you do wash it off, I swear it does make my skin more even and less red.</li>
            <li> cleanser doesn&#x27;t have many exfoliating beads, but I actually prefer that way, and this is why: for about a month and a half, I&#x27;ve been using the &amp;#34;Water-Resistant Professional Skin Care Face and Body Brush System by ToiletTree Products&amp;#34; (also bought on Amazon).</li>
            <li> This is a product that was hard for me to find in most store&#x27;s</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this with the Visibly Even Clear Moisturizer with SPF 30 during the day and the Rapid Tone Repair Moisturizer at night.</li>
            <li> My face has been completely transformed and is the softest it has ever been.</li>
            <li> I used to use more expensive cleansers which work well but who wants to spend that much money on a face wash?  </li>
            <li> Neutrogena is dissapointing lately, even though I used to love their products.</li>
            <li> and I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Soy is a natural skin brightener and Vitamin C is an anti-oxidant that can help improve the look and feel of your skin.  </li>
            <li> firstly, it doesn&#x27;t have enough exfoliating beads by a long shot.</li>
            <li> I love trying new products and occasionally &amp;#34;cheat&amp;#34; on this, but then my skin takes a turn for the worse</li>
            <li> Even at 64 years old, I can get an occasional breakout.  </li>
            <li> I am 58 years old and my dermatologist always comments on my skin - especially my face.</li>
            <li> Although it says it&#x27;s a foaming cleanser, it&#x27;s really very creamy, with minimal microbeads.  </li>
            <li> It has some type of granules in it, which do not bother me, but they were not expected.  </li>
            <li> I would have preferred something that would have left my skin feeling soft.</li>
            <li> I have combination skin and suffer from adult acne and regular breakouts, so I have to deal with marks, spots, and unevenness.</li>
            <li> After one use of both the facial wash and the lotion my skin was smoother, softer, lighter, more even, and less dark spots.  </li>
            <li> The little scrubbies in the cleanser feel smooth rather than some cleansers that have rough scrubbies and almost tear up your skin.</li>
            <li> I am a 22 year old African American girl and my skin tone has never been even.</li>
            <li> Just kept on with the half fast job for months up until tonight when I finished the bottle.</li>
            <li> Now that I&#x27;m a little older all of a sudden</li>
            <li> I have sensitive, blotchy, acne prone skin and have tried tons and tons of other products.</li>
            <li> Sometimes it makes my face feels dry but not excessively dry</li>
            <li> The breakouts I had had dried and faded, and I haven&#x27;t experience new ones.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> I will start with the fact that I do have oily skin with an occasional breakout and dry patches at times.</li>
            <li> This reasonably priced cleanser does a thorough job without irritating my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Nothing drastic like large dark shapes just my forehead and chin were always slightly darker than the rest of my face.</li>
            <li> I had been dealing w breakouts for as long as I can remember.  </li>
            <li> I have used this for a long time.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t dry my skin or irritate it.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t leave my skin dry</li>
            <li> Did not leave my face dry</li>
            <li> I am a 19 year old Black American and I was looking for a product that would even out my skin tone and lighten the dark spots on my face due to acne.  </li>
            <li> It does not dry out my skin but removes my makeup and the little bit of granule texture helps exfoliate.</li>
            <li> and I have half a container left.</li>
            <li> like that of a teenager even though I am almost 30 - and would occasionally get breakouts along my chin or a little pimple or two on my forehead.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin, and none of the other brands I&#x27;ve tried have gotten along with it.</li>
            <li> Prior to using this product my skin   had an uneven tone to it...</li>
            <li> It keeps my skin looking clearer, smoother and brighter without harsh drying effect of using just regular soap.</li>
            <li> I used Proactiv for about eight years, and finally decided to wean myself off of the harsh chemicals.  </li>
            <li> the wash and the moisturizer say it takes up to 8 weeks to see results on dark marks and those 8 weeks are long gone by now</li>
            <li> A little literally goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A product that actually does what it claims (plus a few other goodies)!</li>
            <li> Other products have caused my face to break out.</li>
            <li> I initially purchased this product because I found a cure for my acne and needed a way to rush the healing of the acne scars that were left behind.</li>
            <li> When my break outs and dark spots are the worst i can be confident that i will have clear visibly</li>
            <li> Neutrogena tests on animals, though, and that ruins my lovefest.</li>
            <li> I have had a few pimples pop up, but that was to be expected.  </li>
            <li> It also seemed to leave a slight residue.</li>
            <li> The little microbeads suc because they manage to get stuck in my eye lashes</li>
            <li> My little sis came to visit for a week</li>
            <li> Even product(s) everyday.</li>
            <li> I have been using it everyday for a month now</li>
            <li> If I use something different for a few days I&#x27;m not happy with how my skin looks.  </li>
            <li> and i use this product everyday for the past two months.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for the past 6 months.</li>
            <li> I am usually oily but getting drier as I age.</li>
            <li> Lately I&#x27;ve been getting complements on my skin - this is the cleanser I&#x27;ve been using for years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t unhappy with my current cleanser</li>
            <li> I bought it for my granddaughter as well and the spots in her face are slowly fading.  </li>
            <li> Not a good cleanser for acne.</li>
            <li> This is not a great acne face wash.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry, people that don&#x27;t care if their products are tested on animals, but there are loads of us that DO</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sad to say that this did nothing for that.</li>
            <li> I cannot tell any improvement yet, but this product stinks.  </li>
            <li> This is disappointing to write</li>
            <li> I am shocked.</li>
            <li> No need to go out in the cold for basics!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> WILL ALWAYS BE MY FAVORITE CLEANSER. LOVE THE FEEL AND SEEMS TO EVEN COMPLEXION. A LIL DAB AND MASSAGE VERRRY GENTLY UNTIL BEADS DISAPPEAR.</li>
            <li> My wife has received so many compliments about her complexion and glow since she started using this.&lt;br /&gt;Works great and affordable on my pocket.</li>
            <li> Love. Doesn&#x27;t dry my skin or irritate it. Have been using for years. The little microbeads suc because they manage to get stuck in my eye lashes</li>
            <li> My holy grail cleanser! It smells great, has gentle scrubbing particles (but not too many), removes all makeup (this is a VERY important requirement for me, because otherwise I break out), yet isn&#x27;t drying or greasy. It&#x27;s the perfect balance. I&#x27;ve repurchased this cleanser more than any other cleanser. I&#x27;m 29 years old with combination skin and this has cleared me up without drying me out and somehow, even though you do wash it off, I swear it does make my skin more even and less red. I&#x27;ve tried so many different cleansers, both high and low-end, and this is my favorite. I love trying new products and occasionally &amp;#34;cheat&amp;#34; on this, but then my skin takes a turn for the worse and I come back. Cleansers matter, folks! Try this one, you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> I was using another neutrogena product and with the winter weather my face was feeling like a statue that was cracking. I had been dealing w breakouts for as long as I can remember.  My little sis came to visit for a week and she uses it and loves it so I figured why not try it. Not only does this stuff clean your face, it exfoliates, moisturizes, and best of all clears up and prevents all breakouts!! It illiminates blemishes while illuminating your skin. My face has been completely transformed and is the softest it has ever been. I no longer have to put on make up just to leave the house!!!! It is definately worth trying!!!!!</li>
            <li> I love this product I was using in the past and my face was flawless. Now that I&#x27;m a little older all of a sudden I have all of these breakout&#x27;s. This is a product that was hard for me to find in most store&#x27;s but I&#x27;m so glad I was able to get it on amazon. Thank&#x27;s again.</li>
            <li> I am shocked. A product that actually does what it claims (plus a few other goodies)! Prior to using this product my skin   had an uneven tone to it...probably from years of burning (I have a light skin tone). After about two weeks I noticed that my skin tone was MUCH MORE EVEN. And adding this cleanser was the only change in my skincare routine so it must have been this product. The little scrubbies in the cleanser feel smooth rather than some cleansers that have rough scrubbies and almost tear up your skin. That was a definite plus. The scent was very light to almost non-existent, another plus (I&#x27;m not a big fan of strong fragranced facial cleansers). I think my favorite part about this product is that it has virtually stopped my breakouts! I have combo skin - yes like that of a teenager even though I am almost 30 - and would occasionally get breakouts along my chin or a little pimple or two on my forehead. This product seems to be the right combo of cleanser, exfoliation, and moisturizer (stripping my skin of too much of it&#x27;s moisture tends to cause it to overproduce oil and causes breakouts). All in all, I am in love with this product!    Only problem? Doesn&#x27;t really foam.     Give it a shot!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this on Amazon because it isn&#x27;t offered where I live.  I have to say that this is an amazing product.  I am a 19 year old Black American and I was looking for a product that would even out my skin tone and lighten the dark spots on my face due to acne.  After one use of both the facial wash and the lotion my skin was smoother, softer, lighter, more even, and less dark spots.  I have combination skin and with the lotion it put the right amount of moisture on all areas of my face.  When I used the facial wash there was an instant change on my face.  This is certainly a 5 star product in my book, after searching for the right products I&#x27;ve finally found a line that would work just for me.  Thank you Neutrogena for making amazing products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this with the Visibly Even Clear Moisturizer with SPF 30 during the day and the Rapid Tone Repair Moisturizer at night. I also apply a couple of drops of the Best Vitamin C Serum for Face 2015. I love that my skin is looking better e dry week.</li>
            <li> Even at 64 years old, I can get an occasional breakout.  This is the best cleanser which I have ever tried:  I never have a breakout and  it cleans without drying my combination skin.  Wish I had discovered it much earlier than my 60&#x27;s!!!</li>
            <li> My friend recommended this cleanser to me.  I used to use more expensive cleansers which work well but who wants to spend that much money on a face wash?  I tried a bunch of drugstore ones but didn&#x27;t like them, some left a residue, most were ok but none that I would have bought again.  After my friend told me about this one I searched everywhere for it, none of the stores in our area carried it except for one Target.  I get it on Amazon now, I really hope that Neutrogena is not considering discontinuing this item.  It&#x27;s awesome and is one of their better products!  It&#x27;s exfoliating, but not harsh, and really makes my skin glow.  Now when I do go to the Target that has it I buy 3 at a time.  I don&#x27;t know why more people don&#x27;t know about this product, maybe it needs an upgrade in packaging?</li>
            <li> Neutrogena works for me, I use it twice daily and it helps keep my face fresh and balances the moisture on my face.  My latest order arrived as promised without hassle,thanks Amazon.</li>
            <li> Great product for good price</li>
            <li> Always loved neutrogena! When my break outs and dark spots are the worst i can be confident that i will have clear visibly even skin.&lt;br /&gt;Ps. This is a real review. And i am an african american woman neutrogena definately can work for anybody. Wish i had a photo to share i am very happy with this purchase..try using visibly even sunscreen and night time as well. After only a week i received compliments on the radiance of my skin. This product also does not bleach the skin or give two toned look which is absolutely amazing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using for years. I am 58 years old and my dermatologist always comments on my skin - especially my face. Note that I am not a big sun &amp;#34;worshiper&amp;#34;  so that also helps.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that it doesn&#x27;t take much to apply to the face.  A little literally goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Good price fast shipping</li>
            <li> This is my favorite beauty product, and I can no longer find it in stores.  It is the only one I&#x27;ve found that truly seems to exfoliate without drying out, and it truly does give my skin a more &amp;#34;even&amp;#34; tone.  The smell is very pleasant, unlike most brands.  (Although after reading some reviews, I see some others don&#x27;t agree.)  Although it says it&#x27;s a foaming cleanser, it&#x27;s really very creamy, with minimal microbeads.  I love, love, love this product.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorites. I use it to clean my face every day and night. Though there is no foam, it really does clean, exfoliates, moisturizes and brightens my skin instantly. I have lupus nephritis, and my body/kidneys can&#x27;t get rid of all the toxins in my body, including toxins in my skin. After, being on dialysis for several years now, I&#x27;ve noticed facial discoloration to the point that my skin  looked darker, almost a greyish color. So I made it a ritual to use my Neutrogena Visibly Even product(s) everyday. It keeps my skin looking clearer, smoother and brighter without harsh drying effect of using just regular soap. Even the dialysis staff complements my skin, asking what do I use. Some even think I am still in my 20&#x27;s when I am actually 40! So yes, I love it, because it works for me.</li>
            <li> It leaves your skin soft and smooth after cleansing. Even cleans the toughest eye makeup with lash glue in it. Has a nice scent too. Decent price for a great product.  Definitely will buy again.</li>
            <li> very nice. my face to be tender</li>
            <li> I love Neutrogena&#x27;s Visibly Even Foaming Cleanser.  If I use something different for a few days I&#x27;m not happy with how my skin looks.  I always go right back to this product &amp; immediately see a positive difference.  I used to be able to get this product in the stores, but now I can&#x27;t find it anywhere except on-line.  When I order on-line I stock-up!  I wish Neutrogena would sell this in local stores again, i.e. Target.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Neutrogena - please don&#x27;t ever stop making this cleanser !!!!</li>
            <li> Neutrogena is one of my favorite products because this line is so good for my sensitive skin.  It works well with my skin.  I like that Gabrielle Union is the spokesperson for the product too.</li>
            <li> Another great product that the stores don&#x27;t seem to carry any more. So glad Amazon has it. Lately I&#x27;ve been getting complements on my skin - this is the cleanser I&#x27;ve been using for years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the foaming better than the cream style and it has just enough foam, goes on smoothly and washes off easily. I don&#x27;t wear makeup so I can&#x27;t comment on that, but it does keep my skin clean and free from oils yet moisturizes</li>
            <li> This is the best cleanse I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> I love the tiny little beads that make you feel like exfoliating is really working.  I have tried others but like this cleanser the best.</li>
            <li> Nice and foamy. Smells ok too.</li>
            <li> Works nicely, haven&#x27;t used it for long but soon will update</li>
            <li> Did absolutely nothing for my skin. It got rid of most of my daily make up but didn&#x27;t seem to cleanse fully. It also seemed to leave a slight residue. It didn&#x27;t leave my skin dry but my it did nothing for my skin. It didn&#x27;t break me out but I definitely had more blackheads and zits than when I used other more seemingly effective cleansers at similar price points. I have acne prone combination skin. Only pros was that it smells good and lathers pretty well. The beads provide no exfoliation whatsoever but I didn&#x27;t mind.  Not horrible but not repurchasing.</li>
            <li> I have been able to see a difference in the overall tone of my skin. I will purchase this item again!</li>
            <li> I cannot tell any improvement yet, but this product stinks.  It has some type of granules in it, which do not bother me, but they were not expected.  I imagine they are part of the exfoliation.</li>
            <li> Works well!  Not overly greasy but I&#x27;m concerned that it&#x27;s not moisturizing enough.</li>
            <li> This product is excellent for blemishes. I have been using it for a year now and my facial blemishes are almost non-visible. Plus you don&#x27;t have to use alot for it too work and it&#x27;s sold at a great price!</li>
            <li> It works.  Warning: It will leave your face witter than your neck.</li>
            <li> Great stuff--don&#x27;t understand why stores stopped carrying it or why Neutrogena replaced it.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t unhappy with my current cleanser but I was looking for something new (the bane of my existence). This is great - really cleans and seems to even out skin as advertised (no redness or bumpiness after use). I think I may actually stick to this one (assuming it&#x27;s not discontinued, which always seems to be the case with great products).</li>
            <li> So far, so good.  I&#x27;ve been using this for about 2 months now as a replacement for Proactiv, and I&#x27;m very happy with the results.  It leaves my face feeling clean, but not overly dry.  I have not experienced any adverse effects, and am happy with the price.  I used Proactiv for about eight years, and finally decided to wean myself off of the harsh chemicals.  I have had a few pimples pop up, but that was to be expected.  Overall, I am very happy with this product and plan to continue using this as part of my skincare routine.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t make my skin feel moist at all.</li>
            <li> This cleanser is good for your face.  It really cleans good. It does has the ruff stuff in it but once you wet hands and rub them together the ruff stuff is not bad and it does not scratch your face at all.</li>
            <li> This cleanser feels really good on my skin. I cannot tell if I am imagining things, but I think it has evened out my complexion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell and texture is great. I highly recommend and would definitely buy again at this great Amazon price.</li>
            <li> so far so good.  I love this stuff and again, it is great to have things like this on the Amazon Subscriptions at a fantastic price and delivered!  No need to go out in the cold for basics!</li>
            <li> It didnt meet my expectations at all. Neutrogena is dissapointing lately, even though I used to love their products.</li>
            <li> This is not a great acne face wash. firstly, it doesn&#x27;t have enough exfoliating beads by a long shot. my face has never had so many breakouts than since using this face wash-which is also totally not a foaming cleanser. Not a good cleanser for acne. Good for skin tone and moisturizing though.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy the foaming of the cleanser and the scent is light.  It&#x27;s still early so I cannot comment on the toning yet but it seems to be ok.</li>
            <li> Good night time cleanser, because it contains gentle small little beads, that do not tear your skin, giving you mild exfoliation!</li>
            <li> Plastic microbeads and 4 parabens - lovely fragrance, though.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive, blotchy, acne prone skin and have tried tons and tons of other products. This is by far the best regime for my skin combined with the Visibly Even Moisturizer. I absolutely love it!</li>
            <li> I have used this for a long time. I feel like it cleans well. Other products have caused my face to break out. I use it with the Rapid Wrinkle Repair and Rapid Wrinkle Repair Night. I have been very pleased with Neutrogena Products.</li>
            <li> I use it every day.  My face is smooth and clear.  Will purchase again</li>
            <li> I love this product, i have the mosturizer to it and my face stared clearing up.</li>
            <li> This is by far my favorite facial cleanser from Neutrogena.  I have used a few of the Neutrogena facial cleansers and none of them are as effective as the visibly even.  It helps keep my skin clear and smooth.  I love it and use it every night.  I hope Neutrogena continues to make it.  I also use the visibly even daily moisturizer, which is awesome!</li>
            <li> I have dry skin, and none of the other brands I&#x27;ve tried have gotten along with it. I had given up on using anything but water until I stumbled upon this stuff. Acne isn&#x27;t really a concern for me, but this is a great product for people with dry skin. It is very gentle, but it works.</li>
            <li> I buy these three at a time.  One for the bathroom skin, for the shower, and one for my traveling bag.  It does not dry out my skin but removes my makeup and the little bit of granule texture helps exfoliate.</li>
            <li> I love this facial cleanser. I love it hardcore. Neutrogena tests on animals, though, and that ruins my lovefest. I&#x27;m sorry, people that don&#x27;t care if their products are tested on animals, but there are loads of us that DO care.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lather, the mild exfoliation, the smell, the lack of breaking out from it, the lack of allergic reaction, the actual skintone-evening properties... great, but I won&#x27;t be buying it again. Instead, I will be using more animal-friendly products. As I use up the products I bought before I made this stand, I have the time to research the ingredients and how they work for my skin. None match up to this yet and I have half a container left. I may be screwed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Neutrogena, PLEASE stop animal testing! I want to love you again!</li>
            <li> This is the only face scrub that I like using.  Granted I&amp;#34;m a guy but this does a really good job of providing an even clean look and it lathers up nicely.  Many of the other scrubs don&#x27;t work as well and cost more money.</li>
            <li> I thought this was a different neutrogena face wash to the one i am currently using but when i got the product i realized it was the same thing. It has not done anything for me with removing blemishes and i use this product everyday for the past two months. Sometimes it makes my face feels dry but not excessively dry but i still use it nonetheless. I just wish it was able to remove the blemishes i have.</li>
            <li> Love it, will keep using this item...it works</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  Great price too!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for the past 6 months. I don&#x27;t use it on a regular basis but so far I love the result and the smell of the product when you apply it.</li>
            <li> Works as intended and advertised but the packaging and box arrived torn and tattered.</li>
            <li> I love this face wash. It doesn&#x27;t do anything extra but still I love it better than other face washes I have used before. It makes my skin feel bright and glowing.</li>
            <li> A bit drying but clean feel after using.  I am usually oily but getting drier as I age.</li>
            <li> Good product. Did not leave my face dry and I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> This reasonably priced cleanser does a thorough job without irritating my sensitive skin. It also brightens my complexion. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> A friend told me about this stuff so I went on the hunt and found it here. SOOO glad I did cause this stuff is seriously amazing. It makes my skin super soft and it&#x27;s gentle on my sensitive skin. I have been using it everyday for a month now and I still have alot left. Will be repurchasing when it&#x27;s gone.</li>
            <li> It is a great cleanser, just does not foam.</li>
            <li> This cleanser gets your skin clean, but is a bit too drying for me. I would have preferred something that would have left my skin feeling soft.</li>
            <li> I will start with the fact that I do have oily skin with an occasional breakout and dry patches at times. With that said I can&#x27;t say I like this item to much. It almost left a residue feeling after using it. If you have oily skin with breakouts but have aging skin,  I would recommend using the Neutrogena Healthy Skin Anti Wrinkle Anti Blemish Cleanser.</li>
            <li> Update: This is disappointing to write but I have to be honest and say any effect this had on my skin tone came and went within the first 2 weeks of using it. It evened my overall facial skin tone a bit and I thought that would continue but it did not. Just kept on with the half fast job for months up until tonight when I finished the bottle. (June 5th 2015) I initially purchased this product because I found a cure for my acne and needed a way to rush the healing of the acne scars that were left behind. I&#x27;m sad to say that this did nothing for that. It&#x27;s been months now and the scars are still there healing at the same pace they would had I not purchased this product in the first place. the wash and the moisturizer say it takes up to 8 weeks to see results on dark marks and those 8 weeks are long gone by now and i&#x27;m left feeling cheated. It did not make me break out. I guess that&#x27;s a plus  First and for most, I have only been using this product for 2 weeks now and I also use the moisturizer by the same name. I use both twice a day. In that short amount of time I have already noticed a change in my complexion. I am a 22 year old African American girl and my skin tone has never been even. Nothing drastic like large dark shapes just my forehead and chin were always slightly darker than the rest of my face. Something only I noticed and happily don&#x27;t see anymore.  I was apprehensive at first after reading reviews of this product breaking others out. This has not happened to me. In fact it has help clear my tiny pesky breakouts and given me smooth skin. I also have scaring form acne marks. They have lightened ever so slightly in only 2 weeks. However the cleanser is meant to take longer to eradicate scar marks so I will give an update on that later.  I would say this is something you have to try for yourself. There is no harm in trying and if it works for you like it has been for me, you&#x27;ll finally be able to say that your skin is no longer your enemy!</li>
            <li> I love this face wash, its my daily face wash. Makes my skin so smooth that i wanna wash it over and over. Very creamy! Will purchase again for sure.</li>
            <li> this does wonders for my skin but must be used in combination with moisturizers.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for just two weeks, two times a day, and the results are impressive. I have combination skin and suffer from adult acne and regular breakouts, so I have to deal with marks, spots, and unevenness. After I start using this cleanser, my face lighted up. The skin looks much healthier and even. The breakouts I had had dried and faded, and I haven&#x27;t experience new ones.&lt;br /&gt;This cleanser doesn&#x27;t have many exfoliating beads, but I actually prefer that way, and this is why: for about a month and a half, I&#x27;ve been using the &amp;#34;Water-Resistant Professional Skin Care Face and Body Brush System by ToiletTree Products&amp;#34; (also bought on Amazon). This brush is really good and it had improved the appearance of my skin a lot. So the brush does the exfoliating. After I changed my cleanser, and started to use the Neutrogena Visibly Even, my skin got even better.&lt;br /&gt;I haven´t experienced any irritation or dryness, but every skin is different. Regarding the dryness that some reviewers experienced, I believe that any facial routine always involves cleansing, toning and hydrating. So, I didn&#x27;t had any problems with it. I really think people should try this one and see if it works. For the price, it´s definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> Best face wash I&#x27;ve used! It dries up my oily skin without over drying it and lasts all day even in summer!</li>
            <li> I only use Neutrogena products. The foaming cleanser leaves my skin, silky smooth. I buy my products from Amazon because it&#x27;s cheaper.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this face cleanser.  I have used it for two months now and my skin is brighter and the spots in my face have disappeared.  I bought it for my granddaughter as well and the spots in her face are slowly fading.  I put a small amount on my facial brush and work up a nice foam and then I leave it on my face and hands for about 10 minutes then rinse it off.  It is great.  The price is right too.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this cleanser paired with the Neutrogena Visibly Even SPF 30 Moisturizer.  This cleanser takes off all my makeup (I normally wear mascara, eyeshadow, and a bit of powder if I am feeling oily), and it leaves my skin feeling soft and clean! At this price, it is a steal...it works so much better than more expensive cleansers I have used!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product! :)</li>
            <li> I never planned to purchase this cleanser until I tried the Daily Moisturizer, which works wonders!  With that experience, I thought I&#x27;d give the cleanser a try.  I&#x27;ve been using this cleanser for 5 months, and it is really good!  It has very gentle exfoliants to help polish the skin, but also has soy and vitamin C.  Soy is a natural skin brightener and Vitamin C is an anti-oxidant that can help improve the look and feel of your skin.  My skin always feels fresh, clean, smooth, and soft after I use this cleanser.  Since this is a cleanser and not a leave-on moisturizer, I don&#x27;t think it does much to even out skin tone.  You&#x27;ll need the Daily Moisturizer for that.  However, it will effectively exfoliate, clean, smooth, and soften your skin, just what you want a cleanser to do!</li>
