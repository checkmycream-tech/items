            <li>:)  </li>
            <li>Love it my favorite color</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s my favorite color üòç</li>
            <li>I really love this curling iron.</li>
            <li>when i received the package the hair curler came with some bubble wrap, the bubble wrap wasnt even on top of or bottom of the curler box</li>
            <li>its okay.</li>
            <li>This literally is my favorite brand.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>It came really fast and it works great</li>
            <li>I love this curling wand.</li>
            <li>Gift for  Grand daughter.</li>
            <li>the most my wife used hers was 2x a week</li>
            <li>and that&#x27;s the top she had not touched it up</li>
            <li>and she said it does a way better job</li>
            <li>They all love it</li>
            <li>and I love the glove that helps prevent them from burning fingers.</li>
            <li>You also have to make sure to use some sort of heat protectant so as not to slaughter your hair.</li>
            <li>World like a charm and a fantastic price!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in love :)</li>
            <li>She had tried one at school and was quite pleased.</li>
            <li>Great product, super hot!</li>
            <li>My wife wanted to buy something for my mother in law for her birthday, and she wanted this product, and right now she is loving it</li>
            <li>I would strongly suggest if you want a straightnier or anything else for that matter DO NOT BUY from Herstyler.</li>
            <li>It does beautiful curls; I wish that it worked properly.</li>
            <li>It was worth the buy, I so my own hair and people think I got it done professional by a salon which makes me feel so good.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve made this money 1000s of dollars and this is the way they repay their loyal customers!</li>
            <li>Overall it was great</li>
            <li>But the second time I tried, I LOVED it :)</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s perfect, I plugged it in to make sure it worked in less then a minute it got extremely hot</li>
            <li>Will definitely order another more for friends as gifts!!</li>
            <li>So easy to get nice, soft waves.</li>
            <li>I used this for the first time before  a family party and received many compliments about my hair.  </li>
            <li>Worth every penny!</li>
            <li>Keep far from children and use caution when using it to curl your own hair or someone else&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>Overall a good buy if you&#x27;re not too concern with heat damage.</li>
            <li>I can actually curl my hair easily and it comes out great even though I have stubborn hair that doesnt hold a curl normally.</li>
            <li>But other than that, I&#x27;m really happy with it.</li>
            <li>I love my wand very satisfied does very nice curls the wand is not to big not to small</li>
            <li>It worked fine the first two times i used to aside from the fact that the glove was not 100% heat proof to my hand.</li>
            <li>They built it up to seem like it was worth $150 or whatever.</li>
            <li>to 3-4 months at a time it was rarely used.</li>
            <li>money worth spending</li>
            <li>The curls last all day (which is impressive, I have straight fine hair and live in high humidity) and even all day the next day.</li>
            <li>Luckily I have thicker hair, so that isn&#x27;t too much for me.</li>
            <li>It doest get hot enough to curl my wig but is good on my natural hair.</li>
            <li>I would tell my friends to get it thank you very much</li>
            <li>They worked good for the little bit of use</li>
            <li>The handle gets so hot it burns you while holding it.</li>
            <li>But you might want to wear the glove it comes with because it gets really hot.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use the glove, but I&#x27;d suggest using it the first time even if you swear you won&#x27;t need it.</li>
            <li>Like I said, I have experience with curling wands, but I immediately burned my finger on this thing during my first curl since there is no cool-tip.</li>
            <li>Only thing she complains about is that the top of the handle gets hot if it&#x27;s on for a longtime.</li>
            <li>First, smoke...or steam.  </li>
            <li>However, I would HIGHLY recommend wearing the glove that is provided as this gets VERY HOT.</li>
            <li>Pros: it gets really hot really fast.</li>
            <li>I have bought other curling irons before and they stop working in the middle of the process and this one did its job great.</li>
            <li>I have naturally wavy hair that generally refuses to hold a curl for more than 45 minutes.</li>
            <li>The only thing is that you can easily get burn</li>
            <li>I have two other curling wands that are cone shaped (remington), but I wanted this more consistent size to curl my shoulder-length hair.</li>
            <li>I absolutely would recommend this product to others.</li>
            <li>Very plastic like not real,sturdy.</li>
            <li>She really likes it</li>
            <li>It was also much easier to use than I thought.</li>
            <li>I really like this product</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure the staying power of the curls lies in direct correlation to the extreme temperature the rod reaches, though.</li>
            <li>does curls in less than a min love it</li>
            <li>have long, fine, color-treated hair that is typically soft and quite shiny.  </li>
            <li>I really am surprised with this curling wand, it works really well.</li>
            <li>I have thick hair and wanted to find a curling product that would make nice spiral curls.</li>
            <li>Hold it longer and you have a tighter curl, less time on the wand produces a more natural curl.</li>
            <li>I bought this before Christmas and received it close to New years.</li>
            <li>it feels kind of rough on my hair other than that</li>
            <li>So I talked to the kiosk, and called the company directly.</li>
            <li>This was very easy to use, and only took about 10 min to curl thick hair.</li>
            <li>My only complaints are that there isn&#x27;t an indicator light to tell you when it was on or a stand to set it down on.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t purchase it then because there are three major issues with this product.</li>
            <li>it was right next to the hair curler box if you know what i mean it wasnt really protecting the curler when i got the glove it had some type of lipstick smeared on it which is really gross.</li>

            <li> I do advise only using it while wearing long sleeves and picking up an additional heat resistant glove at Sally&#x27;s--</li>
            <li> I tried this rod on my dry (for the entire day) hair.  </li>
            <li> Now my hair looks dry (something unheard of with my traditional curling iron), feels dry and makes me want to cry.  </li>
            <li> I would also recommend this product for adults, but do not recommend it for preteens or young teens due to the extreme heat.</li>
            <li> feels a bit strange</li>
            <li> I only had it there for a few second when i noticed the plastic melting from the bottom.</li>
            <li> But I can&#x27;t use it on my friends who have thin hair because it&#x27;s just too hot.</li>
            <li> so when I first used it, I was sooo confused, and I couldnt get the hang of it.</li>
            <li> Much less than the same model in the mall.</li>
            <li> Being a stylist for 20 years I expect quality, ,thiw iron is not best to use if u have small hands , , and  did not get hot enough for my coarse  hair ,, seller was obnoxious about a return , wouldn&#x27;t buy ever again conair quality appliance</li>
            <li> I got a pink one for myself and this purple one for my grandmother.</li>
            <li> So, you have to be reallllllly careful not to burn yourself because a millisecond of contact can cause some damage.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t used the glove since it made it harder to manage my hair and the wand.</li>
            <li> could never get curls like this with any other curler.</li>
            <li> so you have to be very careful.</li>
            <li> It would take approximately 2 hours to do my hair with it because you can only use a tiny amount of hair on it at a time...</li>
            <li> The only complaint I have is that there is no heat control, it just heats up to an automatic 400 degrees.</li>
            <li> but i feel like the wand is too small for my hair since my hair is long.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t believe I&#x27;ve ever left a negative review before.  </li>
            <li> but I got it down.</li>
            <li> and I mean tiny.</li>
            <li> Why else would someone buy a warrnity other then have your product covered when it broke!</li>
            <li> Saw this in the mall and bought it on Amazon for less than half the price.  </li>
            <li> The reason it works so well is because it gets so hot, but it can be dangerous.</li>
            <li> It does seem a little cheaper made than others I have looked at but for the price and the amount of use it&#x27;ll get, you can not beat it.</li>
            <li> It does get very hot on the base where it meets the iron (where the on-off switch is)</li>
            <li> Try not to use small portions of hair it may cause burning.</li>
            <li> No more buying them elsewhere.</li>
            <li> like I have in the past.</li>
            <li> I was worried about the small size of the wand.</li>
            <li> it was put through, nothing to hard</li>
            <li> Hard to tell which.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!!!</li>
            <li> The cord is also very long, which I suppose could be considered a pro to some people, but for me it is annoying.</li>
            <li> My hair is real thick.</li>
            <li> But found it difficult to work with..</li>
            <li> I also received this anti aging serum which is weird because i dont think the herstyler curlers come with The acual hair curler</li>
            <li> This company is CRAP!</li>

            <li> Love this wand!!! Best curls ever!!!! Try not to use small portions of hair it may cause burning.</li>
            <li> I tried the herstyler at a mall and they used a tiny section of hair to show me how it works. They built it up to seem like it was worth $150 or whatever. SO GLAD I didn&#x27;t purchase it then because there are three major issues with this product. 1.) The handle gets so hot it burns you while holding it. 2.) There is no temp control. 3.) It would take approximately 2 hours to do my hair with it because you can only use a tiny amount of hair on it at a time...and I mean tiny. Don&#x27;t waste your money!!!</li>
            <li> My sister in law is going to love it it&#x27;s perfect, I plugged it in to make sure it worked in less then a minute it got extremely hot, i&#x27;m happy :) thank u!</li>

            <li> It doest get hot enough to curl my wig but is good on my natural hair.</li>
            <li> Much less than the same model in the mall. Works great</li>
            <li> Love this product! Great price, good outcome.</li>
            <li> Awesomeness!! I can actually curl my hair easily and it comes out great even though I have stubborn hair that doesnt hold a curl normally. Now I can go all day with dandy locks! :)  I was recommended by a friend and would recommended to anyone. Plus its not pricey! If it breaks in a year I will buy it again!</li>
            <li> Love it my favorite color it works good I would tell my friends to get it thank you very much</li>
            <li> I bought this before Christmas and received it close to New years. I absolutely love it. The curls are beautiful, bouncy, and they stay all day. I got several compliments. But you might want to wear the glove it comes with because it gets really hot. Overall it was great and I definitely recommend it to all.</li>
            <li> I absolutely would recommend this product to others. It was worth the buy, I so my own hair and people think I got it done professional by a salon which makes me feel so good. I really love the fact that it came with the hear protective glove that&#x27;s very awesome, as it becomes very hot quick and it&#x27;s one standard heat. Will definitely order another more for friends as gifts!!</li>
            <li> Gets warm,quickly. But found it difficult to work with.. Maybe I need to work with it a little,more? Very plastic like not real,sturdy.</li>
            <li> I love my wand very satisfied does very nice curls the wand is not to big not to small and it&#x27;s my favorite color üòç</li>
            <li> Great product, super hot!</li>
            <li> I really love this curling iron. It works &amp;#34;GREAT&amp;#34;....Thank you  No more buying them elsewhere. I would recommend this to everyone.</li>
            <li> It works good but when I curl my hair with a straightener it stays in longer. My hair is real thick. It gives really nice curls. I would buy it again. Does the job .</li>
            <li> when i received the package the hair curler came with some bubble wrap, the bubble wrap wasnt even on top of or bottom of the curler box it was right next to the hair curler box if you know what i mean it wasnt really protecting the curler when i got the glove it had some type of lipstick smeared on it which is really gross. I also received this anti aging serum which is weird because i dont think the herstyler curlers come with The acual hair curler feels a bit strange it feels kind of rough on my hair other than that its okay.</li>
            <li> It worked fine the first two times i used to aside from the fact that the glove was not 100% heat proof to my hand. The third time i used it a piece of plastic melted on my hair. I only had it there for a few second when i noticed the plastic melting from the bottom. I continued to use it as i had to finish doing my hair and the melted part had disappeared  from the iron. Later i found the plastic tangled in my hair. It does beautiful curls; I wish that it worked properly.</li>
            <li> This literally is my favorite brand. heats up very nicely.</li>
            <li> Love it. Makes the perfect curls.</li>
            <li> It came really fast and it works great I just love it..!!!</li>
            <li> Amazing product, great value, does the job!  I do advise only using it while wearing long sleeves and picking up an additional heat resistant glove at Sally&#x27;s--I touched it to my arm for a millisecond the second time I used it and got quite a burn.  Keep far from children and use caution when using it to curl your own hair or someone else&#x27;s.  The reason it works so well is because it gets so hot, but it can be dangerous.</li>
            <li> I got a pink one for myself and this purple one for my grandmother. She really likes it but hers didnt come with a glove, so I had to give her mine.</li>
            <li> I love this curling wand. I have two other curling wands that are cone shaped (remington), but I wanted this more consistent size to curl my shoulder-length hair. The curls last all day (which is impressive, I have straight fine hair and live in high humidity) and even all day the next day. It does get very hot on the base where it meets the iron (where the on-off switch is) but I have no problem avoiding holding it by that section. I don&#x27;t use the glove, but I&#x27;d suggest using it the first time even if you swear you won&#x27;t need it. Like I said, I have experience with curling wands, but I immediately burned my finger on this thing during my first curl since there is no cool-tip. My only complaint would be that there is no light indicating whether it is on or off, so it might be easy to walk out the door without realizing it is still on, so I always unplug it just in case. The cord is also very long, which I suppose could be considered a pro to some people, but for me it is annoying.</li>
            <li> Gift for  Grand daughter. She has not told me whether she likes it or not. I will update when I talk to her.</li>
            <li> I do not heat style my hair often so I can not vouch for the durability. It does seem a little cheaper made than others I have looked at but for the price and the amount of use it&#x27;ll get, you can not beat it. It was also much easier to use than I thought. Glove is hug though, perfect for large hands I guess?</li>
            <li> READ TIL THE END! I got 2 of these her styler products and paid EXTRA! For the lifetime warranty. I got One for my wife and one for my sister. They worked good for the little bit of use it was put through, nothing to hard the most my wife used hers was 2x a week and that&#x27;s the top she had not touched it up to 3-4 months at a time it was rarely used. Same with my sister. My sisters herstyler cracked and won&#x27;t heat up any more! my wife&#x27;s just quit heating up. So I talked to the kiosk, and called the company directly. They told me they will not back the warrnity I purchased! And they told my wife we would have to pay $100 upgrade fee. If I did that it would be $200 to replace the products that I purchased lifetime warrnities with to avoid future headache and so the product would be covered! This company is CRAP! Why else would someone buy a warrnity other then have your product covered when it broke! I would strongly suggest if you want a straightnier or anything else for that matter DO NOT BUY from Herstyler. And when I talked to the company on the phone they bull$#^++% me and told me that there are only 3 people running a company that is producing hundreds of thousands of products. They also told me it is NOT a corporation, that it was a family owned business. The company does not stick to their word. And everyone involved is trained to Lie. I will never do business with or refer anyone to this company ever again like I have in the past. I&#x27;ve made this money 1000s of dollars and this is the way they repay their loyal customers! If you purchase one of these products be prepared to spend more money on repair or replacement even WITH a warrnity! I would refer you to the CHI AIR I got my wife one and she loved it and she said it does a way better job then the Herstyler ever thought to.</li>
            <li> Great product.  I have thick hair and wanted to find a curling product that would make nice spiral curls. This was perfect for me.  I used this for the first time before  a family party and received many compliments about my hair.  However, I would HIGHLY recommend wearing the glove that is provided as this gets VERY HOT. I would also recommend this product for adults, but do not recommend it for preteens or young teens due to the extreme heat.</li>
            <li> I bought 3. One for each daughter. They all love it and I love the glove that helps prevent them from burning fingers. Great product and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Love this! So easy to get nice, soft waves. Only takes me 10 min!!</li>
            <li> I really am surprised with this curling wand, it works really well. The only complaint I have is that there is no heat control, it just heats up to an automatic 400 degrees. Luckily I have thicker hair, so that isn&#x27;t too much for me. But I can&#x27;t use it on my friends who have thin hair because it&#x27;s just too hot. But other than that, I&#x27;m really happy with it.</li>
            <li> Good product.  Works well, tried one in the mall.  This one gives the same curls.  Very glad I choose this one.</li>
            <li> It took practice but I got it down. I love this want!!</li>
            <li> Im so inlove with it. It works great</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 13 year daughter. She loves it .. She uses it on a regular day basis .. Only thing she complains about is that the top of the handle gets hot if it&#x27;s on for a longtime.</li>
            <li> Pros: it gets really hot really fast. Thermal glove protects from getting burn.&lt;br /&gt;Cons: no temp control. Overall a good buy if you&#x27;re not too concern with heat damage.</li>
            <li> This product is awesome! Mine arrived yesterday, so I tried some curls before bed. When I woke up, the curls had not fallen and still look great. This was very easy to use, and only took about 10 min to curl thick hair. Glad I tried this iron!</li>
            <li> This is the second HerStyler product I have bought and I love it!</li>
            <li> I have naturally wavy hair that generally refuses to hold a curl for more than 45 minutes. With this curling rod, my curls will last all day, even when I&#x27;m running around sweating at work. I don&#x27;t even have to use hairspray. I&#x27;m pretty sure the staying power of the curls lies in direct correlation to the extreme temperature the rod reaches, though. So, you have to be reallllllly careful not to burn yourself because a millisecond of contact can cause some damage. You also have to make sure to use some sort of heat protectant so as not to slaughter your hair. My only complaints are that there isn&#x27;t an indicator light to tell you when it was on or a stand to set it down on. Great curling rod for the price!</li>
            <li> I really like this product but i feel like the wand is too small for my hair since my hair is long. but the quality&#x27;s great. they sell this at the mall for $100 +. money worth spending</li>
            <li> Love it!  World like a charm and a fantastic price!</li>
            <li> First time using a curling wand, and it went awesome! I didn&#x27;t used the glove since it made it harder to manage my hair and the wand.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t come with glove</li>
            <li> Saw this in the mall and bought it on Amazon for less than half the price.  This wand is AMAZING!!  The iron warms up within seconds and I can do my entire head in 10 minutes and the curls last for days.  Great investment.</li>
            <li> its awsome just like the one they sale at the mall but cheaper does curls in less than a min love it</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t believe I&#x27;ve ever left a negative review before.  As I type this, I am sitting with my hair soaked in argan oil hoping it will restore the moisture this devil-appliance took.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have long, fine, color-treated hair that is typically soft and quite shiny.  I curl my hair EVERY DAY and have for 20+ years.  I tried this rod on my dry (for the entire day) hair.  First, smoke...or steam.  Hard to tell which.  I assumed it was the product on my hair.  Now my hair looks dry (something unheard of with my traditional curling iron), feels dry and makes me want to cry.  It is going back as soon as I can get to UPS.  I hope my hair recovers!</li>
            <li> My wife wanted to buy something for my mother in law for her birthday, and she wanted this product, and right now she is loving it</li>
            <li> I was worried about the small size of the wand. It was a gift for my neice. She loved it and her hair looked darling. Hold it longer and you have a tighter curl, less time on the wand produces a more natural curl. Perfection!</li>
            <li> Daughter loves item. thank you for great price</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product!</li>
            <li> OM-Heavens!! LOOOOOVVVVEE! If u want beautiful sexy hair - this is a must! What a steal!! Thank the Lord I didn&#x27;t purchase at the mall!! Almost though- for $175 üôÄ</li>
            <li> glove could be a lil thicker</li>
            <li> I have never had or used a hair wand before... so when I first used it, I was sooo confused, and I couldnt get the hang of it. But the second time I tried, I LOVED it :)&lt;br /&gt;I could never get curls like this with any other curler. I&#x27;m in love :)</li>
            <li> This is a gift that my daughter wanted for Christmas. She had tried one at school and was quite pleased.</li>
            <li> I love this curling wand!! Defintely does its job and the curls stay for hours! Worth every penny! Herstyler has the best products!</li>
            <li> This item was amazing. I have bought other curling irons before and they stop working in the middle of the process and this one did its job great. The only thing is that you can easily get burn so you have to be very careful.</li>
