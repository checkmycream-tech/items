            <li>This product is perfect.</li>
            <li>It forms my curls perfectly.</li>
            <li>Best of all NO poof, frizz, or that yucky greasy or crunchy feeling.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still searching for the perfect stuff to use in my hair.</li>
            <li>This cream is one of the best I have tried (in its price range), so of course like every curl product I like</li>
            <li>About 4 pumps works best for my shoulder length hair.  </li>
            <li>Even my bf uses this product and he is east indian, it is great!!!!!</li>
            <li>When I use this product, my hair looks sooo shiny and my curls look awesome without leaving any buildup or grease.</li>
            <li>All their products have been using for a couple of months now and are great.</li>
            <li>found nothing great about it.</li>
            <li>but what I had smelled great and worked well.</li>
            <li>Great products that are affordable.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many curl products and just can&#x27;t seem to get the awesome results I get with this stuff!</li>
            <li>Does do a good job reducing frizz, though.</li>
            <li>This is also good for some sprucing up in the afternoon or evening.</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product!</li>
            <li>This product works better than any salon product I have tried, and I have tried a LOT!</li>
            <li>which was amazing because I run oil, and conditioner through my hair before applying any styling aide for all day moisture.  </li>
            <li>By the time my hair dries, my curls have amazing definition and body--and it doesn&#x27;t look or feel like there&#x27;s anything in my hair</li>
            <li>It causes hair to be moist, manageable and leaves it with a nice fragrance.</li>
            <li>the kind that turns into a frizz bomb at the slightest hint of humidity.</li>
            <li>This is a suitable product for dougla hair.</li>
            <li>Strongly recommended!</li>
            <li>I love, love, love this product.  </li>
            <li>know how panic-inducing it is to not be able to find the product you rely on.  </li>
            <li>Hopefully this recommendation will save others some stress. :)</li>
            <li>and I love my curls now.</li>
            <li>This product is &#x27;ok&#x27;.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite curl cream.</li>
            <li>I rated this a 4 because it is just ok, I like the product</li>
            <li>but it could do more but for the price</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d like to suggest applying a mousse or gel over the product to acheive bouncy, well-definded curls since this product is more of a \\&quot;base\\&quot; and not a styler.</li>
            <li>Most of the cream was thrown away...</li>
            <li>Love the stuff.  </li>
            <li>and I have the softest defined friz free curls ever!</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I never used to be able to shower then go on my way</li>
            <li>I also love the Fructis anti frizz hairspray.</li>
            <li>This product works pretty good</li>
            <li>For best results I would pat dry my hair with a towel after washing, then scrunch my hair with the product and either blow dry with a diffuser or let air dry--my best results were with air drying.  </li>
            <li>This product is a dream come true!</li>
            <li>I have the kind of curls that have potential to be beautiful when the right product is applied.</li>
            <li>Strong hold equals no hold at all.</li>
            <li>I have fine, curly, frizzy hair...</li>
            <li>I use it after I wash my hair while its still damp and it leaves it defined, smooth, and bouncy.</li>
            <li>but I love the feel of my hair when I use this product, so it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>I also found that I could go easier without washing for a couple of days when I used this stuff too and very rarely on those days</li>
            <li>Calm Down cream is the best leave in conditioner anti-friz product I have ever tried!  </li>
            <li>so it would be &amp;#34;protected&amp;#34; but the cream was all over the bag and took forever to clean.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good about this product.</li>
            <li>With using all of the products together, I have very pretty and curly hair that gets compliments all the time.  </li>
            <li>only positive aspect is that it smells good.</li>
            <li>it really works on my fine, frizzy, wavy hair.</li>
            <li>It can&#x27;t really compete with Houston humidity to control frizz, but it works fine until I find something else.</li>
            <li>Fortunately, though, Amazon sells it for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>GF products are all over the place, so it was worth a try.  </li>
            <li>It keeps the curls with just the right amount of hold without any frizz.</li>
            <li>This product leaves my hair nice and smooth without feeling weighed down.</li>
            <li>This product is amazing for my daughter&#x27;s hair (fine, tight curls).  </li>
            <li>But, I did want to suggest a new product I found last night that seems to be a good substitute:</li>
            <li>I normally use Wonder Waves by Garnier Fructis, which is fantastic by the way, but as the weather got more humid I needed a little more help.  </li>
            <li>did I have to put more in to finish the look, I seriously would just kind of get up and go.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for over a year, it really works!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve enjoyed using this product for over a year now and recently found this when searching for subscribe and save items.  </li>
            <li>I followed the instructions exactly</li>
            <li>and this product boosts curls while moisturizing my hair, more so than gel products, and keeps shape the next day, unlike mousse.  </li>
            <li>only I guess :)</li>
            <li>This is the first product that doesn&#x27;t feel greasy or sticky, and doesn&#x27;t stop working even after I sleep on it.</li>
            <li>It tames flyaways and leaves my wavy hair in good shape without it feeling stiff, sticky, or even greasy.</li>
            <li>It was the only product I had to use after washing my hair to get great results and it left my hair feeling really soft all day.  </li>
            <li>As I said this product is ok, but given the choice I choose the Garnier Blow dry perfector.</li>
            <li>I work through all my hair, then add mousse to roots and a bit more all over, then blow dry with diffuser.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not really a Garnier fan, but this I love so much that I&#x27;m now ordering it online because my Wal-Mart doesn&#x27;t carry it anymore</li>
            <li>If I don&#x27;t use too much fructis cream, it doesn&#x27;t burn on the iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really like this product.  </li>
            <li>Works very well.</li>
            <li>I really like Garnier Fructis products</li>
            <li>it olds my hair much straighter.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>Certainly calms down the frizzies on most days.</li>
            <li>This is probably best for someone with thin hair, though I don&#x27;t see many people with thin curly hair.</li>
            <li>my hair is full and wavy but not coarse or textured-</li>
            <li>Good stuff for curly frizzy hair, but not good for roots as it can make your roots just a touch greasy.</li>
            <li>Most products, like this, weigh my hair down.</li>
            <li>so I must use a lot of the cream to be thorough, but the main things I noticed were:&lt;br /&gt;1).</li>
            <li>It really does make my hair soft and hydrated!</li>
            <li>Thankfully I finally found Garnier Curl Calm</li>
            <li>This product works all day, in fact after a few hours, I think it then begins to work even better.</li>
            <li>It hydrates and nourishes your dry curly hair making it smooth and soft (not frizzy).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t</li>
            <li>It works best if your hair is a little towel dried but not yet completely dry.</li>
            <li>and I live in the heart of SE Texas and the humidity here</li>
            <li>A better choice for me (fine curly hair) a product I like much better, same company is:  [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s slightly more expensive, but available for subscribe and save, which I love.&lt;br</li>
            <li>(the only giveaway is the nice sweet but subtle scent)!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t need a whole lot of taming, but for someone with very kinky/wiry hair, this product might not offer enough hold.</li>
            <li>should mention that I have very soft hair, so</li>
            <li>First, let me say that I use the entire product line - and probably 2-3 styling products every day.  </li>
            <li>This leaves my hair frizz free and shiny, but not weighed down or crispy at all.</li>
            <li>It weighs my hair down so much that my natural curls turn into mild waves&lt;br /&gt;4).</li>
            <li>Usually I sleep on it and wake up with soft, natural (less frizzy) curls, but the best method is to wet your hair in the morning, then apply it and go about your day.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t leave that hard, brittle gunk like most of the products I&#x27;ve tried before.</li>
            <li>However, this product holds curls in my hair, gets rid of the frizz, and my hair is still soft.</li>
            <li>It makes my natural curly hair soft and gives my hair plenty if moisture.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair with soft and bouncy curls.</li>
            <li>Apply gel or mousse in the same manner (not quite as much as the cream) then set with a flexible hairspray..</li>
            <li>My hair is soft to the touch also.  </li>
            <li>spread a little onto my fingers and run it over my hair, more so towards the ends then I let it dry naturally.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t even compare this product to those because this is a \\&quot;calm down anti-frizz cream\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>I use this on my hair to calm down frizz, not make it curly.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I just tried the curl calm down</li>
            <li>A true tame mazer without using blow dryers or curling irons.</li>
            <li>I believe the &#x27;strong hold\\&quot; means it keeps frizzes down and not to hold your scrunched hair!!!</li>
            <li>I use about a teaspoon (in total) on my just below shoulder length naturally wavy hair.  </li>
            <li>I also tried not following the directions (ex. putting too much, or not enough) and I received the same result.  </li>
            <li>I scrunch it gently into wet hair.</li>
            <li>This is definitely not the case with the Curl Calm Down cream.</li>
            <li>(my hair would dry in a crazy, frizzy mess), but now it&#x27;s my best look!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the same bottle but an aqua color package and has all the same claims as calm down.</li>
            <li>And its really like putting lotion in your hair which is an odd consistency.</li>
            <li>I have curly/wavy hair that doesn&#x27;t really know what it&#x27;s doing half the time</li>
            <li>I tried less and its the same really.</li>

            <li> I don&#x27;t need a whole lot of taming, but for someone with very kinky/wiry hair, this product might not offer enough hold.</li>
            <li> should mention that I have very soft hair, so</li>
            <li> First, let me say that I use the entire product line - and probably 2-3 styling products every day.  </li>
            <li> This leaves my hair frizz free and shiny, but not weighed down or crispy at all.</li>
            <li> It weighs my hair down so much that my natural curls turn into mild waves&lt;br /&gt;4).</li>
            <li> Usually I sleep on it and wake up with soft, natural (less frizzy) curls, but the best method is to wet your hair in the morning, then apply it and go about your day.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave that hard, brittle gunk like most of the products I&#x27;ve tried before.</li>
            <li> However, this product holds curls in my hair, gets rid of the frizz, and my hair is still soft.</li>
            <li> It makes my natural curly hair soft and gives my hair plenty if moisture.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair with soft and bouncy curls.</li>
            <li> Apply gel or mousse in the same manner (not quite as much as the cream) then set with a flexible hairspray..</li>
            <li> My hair is soft to the touch also.  </li>
            <li> spread a little onto my fingers and run it over my hair, more so towards the ends then I let it dry naturally.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t even compare this product to those because this is a \\&quot;calm down anti-frizz cream\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I use this on my hair to calm down frizz, not make it curly.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I just tried the curl calm down</li>
            <li> A true tame mazer without using blow dryers or curling irons.</li>
            <li> I believe the &#x27;strong hold\\&quot; means it keeps frizzes down and not to hold your scrunched hair!!!</li>
            <li> I use about a teaspoon (in total) on my just below shoulder length naturally wavy hair.  </li>
            <li> I also tried not following the directions (ex. putting too much, or not enough) and I received the same result.  </li>
            <li> I scrunch it gently into wet hair.</li>
            <li> This is definitely not the case with the Curl Calm Down cream.</li>
            <li> (my hair would dry in a crazy, frizzy mess), but now it&#x27;s my best look!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the same bottle but an aqua color package and has all the same claims as calm down.</li>
            <li> And its really like putting lotion in your hair which is an odd consistency.</li>
            <li> I have curly/wavy hair that doesn&#x27;t really know what it&#x27;s doing half the time</li>
            <li> I tried less and its the same really.</li>
            <li> I was a little weary because it said the hold was \\&quot;strong\\&quot; and usually products with strong hold make my hair crunchy.</li>
            <li> I use it directly on my wet hair and let it dry naturally.</li>
            <li> What I usually do is wrap my hair in a towel for about 3 minutes, take it down, then part my hair in 2 (left an right) and apply 2-3 pumps to each side in a \\&quot;pull back\\&quot; motion.</li>

            <li> Especially when I let it air dry.</li>
            <li> It calms my curls down so that they are not extremely puffy or frizzy without taking the curls away at all.</li>
            <li> can even use this then blow dry my hair.</li>
            <li> It is lighter weight, as I blow dry</li>
            <li> In the end all I had were frizzy, dry curls...</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love, love, love this product.  I have the kind of curls that have potential to be beautiful when the right product is applied. This product is perfect. It calms my curls down so that they are not extremely puffy or frizzy without taking the curls away at all. I get a lot of compliments on my curls with this products.</li>
            <li> hair type: thick, med length, coarse, wavy&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just want to say that this product is like a leave-in conditioner. It hydrates and nourishes your dry curly hair making it smooth and soft (not frizzy).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t expect this to be like gel or a mousse. Don&#x27;t even compare this product to those because this is a \\&quot;calm down anti-frizz cream\\&quot;. If you plan to use this as your sole styling product you might be disappointed. I believe the &#x27;strong hold\\&quot; means it keeps frizzes down and not to hold your scrunched hair!!! Just read the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend putting this all through your hair (maybe 2 pumps). If you want to scrunch your hair...then apply a mouse or gel. I use this on my hair to calm down frizz, not make it curly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can even use this then blow dry my hair. This is not sticky or greasy! I love it! It really does make my hair soft and hydrated!</li>
            <li> I like this it really works on my fine, frizzy, wavy hair. Give it a try, for the price you can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
            <li> First, let me say that I use the entire product line - and probably 2-3 styling products every day.  I have extremely frizzy hair and I live in the heart of SE Texas and the humidity here is INSANE.  Like really insane.  With using all of the products together, I have very pretty and curly hair that gets compliments all the time.  I have not purchased this from Amazon due to the problems with getting the shampoo and conditioner shipped and having a big mess to deal with, but I do buy this at the local grocery store.</li>
            <li> This leaves my hair frizz free and shiny, but not weighed down or crispy at all. This is on my subscriptions list now.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for over a year, it really works! It forms my curls perfectly. If you have curly hair I def recommend you try this product.</li>
            <li> This product leaves my hair nice and smooth without feeling weighed down. Most products, like this, weigh my hair down. This one doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve enjoyed using this product for over a year now and recently found this when searching for subscribe and save items.  I won&#x27;t have to buy it in the store any longer.  I use about a teaspoon (in total) on my just below shoulder length naturally wavy hair.  If I didn&#x27;t, it would look like that witch&#x27;s hair (the witch in the Bugs Bunny short who would take off on her broomstick in a poof, leaving behind an assortment of bobbie pins).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I spread a little onto my fingers and run it over my hair, more so towards the ends then I let it dry naturally.  Next day I&#x27;ll curl it to straighten it out with a 1&amp;#34; curling iron on the ends.  If I don&#x27;t use too much fructis cream, it doesn&#x27;t burn on the iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hopefully, Fructis won&#x27;t fix what isn&#x27;t broken and change the formula (for the worse), or take it off the market.</li>
            <li> Nothing out of the ordinary. I mix it with the curling cream, and get lots of compliments on my curls.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing for my daughter&#x27;s hair (fine, tight curls).  I&#x27;m afraid that it&#x27;s being discontinued because I haven&#x27;t been able to find it lately in my area or on Amazon.  Sad :(  But, I did want to suggest a new product I found last night that seems to be a good substitute: L&#x27;Oreal EverCurl Hydracharge Leave-In Cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/LOreal-Paris-EverCurl-Hydracharge-Leave-In/dp/B00AREI6DC/ref&#x3D;sr_1_3?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1391445551&amp;sr&#x3D;8-3&amp;keywords&#x3D;evercurl&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s slightly more expensive, but available for subscribe and save, which I love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know how panic-inducing it is to not be able to find the product you rely on.  Especially when you had to go through dozens of products to find one that works!  Hopefully this recommendation will save others some stress. :)</li>
            <li> This product did not do a thing for my curly and frizzy hair.  I followed the instructions exactly and my hair turned out just like it always does, pouffy and frizzy.  I would not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This product is a dream come true! I had a love/ hate relationship with my very frizzy, thin, corkscrew curls. Living in South Florida, I tried every anti frizz product and nothing worked. I just tried the curl calm down and I love my curls now. I use it after I wash my hair while its still damp and it leaves it defined, smooth, and bouncy. Best of all NO poof, frizz, or that yucky greasy or crunchy feeling. I would buy this in bulk.</li>
            <li> Strong hold equals no hold at all. And its really like putting lotion in your hair which is an odd consistency. But does help tame frizz somewhat.</li>
            <li> I have curly/wavy hair that doesn&#x27;t really know what it&#x27;s doing half the time and I feel like I have used every product known to man for curly/wavy hair. I hit the jackpot with this product. I was a little weary because it said the hold was \\&quot;strong\\&quot; and usually products with strong hold make my hair crunchy. However, this product holds curls in my hair, gets rid of the frizz, and my hair is still soft. I definitely recommend this to anyone with hard-to-manage curly/wavy hair!</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  I use it with Garnier Fructis Style Curl Sculpting Gel to control my curly hair.</li>
            <li> I use this product on my hair after I have washed it. I use it directly on my wet hair and let it dry naturally. Certainly calms down the frizzies on most days. Nothing works for extreme humidity, but I found a lot of control. It seems this product may be out of production. That&#x27;s a shame. Works very well.</li>
            <li> I dont think its doing anything, so I stopped using the product.  I followed the directions.  I also tried not following the directions (ex. putting too much, or not enough) and I received the same result.  I really like Garnier Fructis products, however this one didnt work for my curly, frizzy 4b/c hair. Yes, Im black.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still searching for the perfect stuff to use in my hair. This isn&#x27;t it. It can&#x27;t really compete with Houston humidity to control frizz, but it works fine until I find something else.</li>
            <li> This product is &#x27;ok&#x27;. It does tame curls but seems heavy, somewhat gooey.  I tried less and its the same really. A better choice for me (fine curly hair) a product I like much better, same company is:  [[ASIN:B0058CJUWO Garnier Blow Dry Perfector Straightening Balm, Sleek and Shine, 5.1 Fluid Ounce]]  It is lighter weight, as I blow dry it olds my hair much straighter. As I said this product is ok, but given the choice I choose the Garnier Blow dry perfector.</li>
            <li> This creamer smooths, reduces flyaways and makes my 4a -4b thick hair lay down with no problem which is why it gets all stars and nothing less. All their products have been using for a couple of months now and are great. A true tame mazer without using blow dryers or curling irons. Recommended to women or men with thick wavy hair.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite curl cream. It makes my natural curly hair soft and gives my hair plenty if moisture.</li>
            <li> Difficult to find this product in stores.  They may have discontinued this product, but I think they launched the same or similar product under the l&#x27;oreal line in a product called Evercurl.  It&#x27;s the same bottle but an aqua color package and has all the same claims as calm down. I hope this is helpful for all the upset customers trying to find this product.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product! It leaves my hair with soft and bouncy curls. It doesn&#x27;t leave that hard, brittle gunk like most of the products I&#x27;ve tried before. And for the price you can&#x27;t go wrong!!</li>
            <li> I rated this a 4 because it is just ok, I like the product but it could do more but for the price what would you expect</li>
            <li> This cream is one of the best I have tried (in its price range), so of course like every curl product I like it seems like they have stopped selling it in stores.  Anyway, I&#x27;m Italian- my hair is full and wavy but not coarse or textured- and this product boosts curls while moisturizing my hair, more so than gel products, and keeps shape the next day, unlike mousse.  About 4 pumps works best for my shoulder length hair.  I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many curl products and just can&#x27;t seem to get the awesome results I get with this stuff! I&#x27;m hispanic and have 3c hair. I&#x27;ve seen some reviews stating that this stuff doesn&#x27;t do anything for them... I&#x27;d like to suggest applying a mousse or gel over the product to acheive bouncy, well-definded curls since this product is more of a \\&quot;base\\&quot; and not a styler. What I usually do is wrap my hair in a towel for about 3 minutes, take it down, then part my hair in 2 (left an right) and apply 2-3 pumps to each side in a \\&quot;pull back\\&quot; motion. Apply gel or mousse in the same manner (not quite as much as the cream) then set with a flexible hairspray.. I get compliments on my hair all the time!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not really a Garnier fan, but this I love so much that I&#x27;m now ordering it online because my Wal-Mart doesn&#x27;t carry it anymore and I don&#x27;t want to be without it. It tames flyaways and leaves my wavy hair in good shape without it feeling stiff, sticky, or even greasy. It works best if your hair is a little towel dried but not yet completely dry. I do have to use a lot - like 3 pumps - but I love the feel of my hair when I use this product, so it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> found nothing great about it. frizz was still there but, then again, i do have a 4c hair and a lot of it</li>
            <li> It came broken. The cream in a bag so it would be &amp;#34;protected&amp;#34; but the cream was all over the bag and took forever to clean. Most of the cream was thrown away... but what I had smelled great and worked well.</li>
            <li> Not everything I was hoping for.  GF products are all over the place, so it was worth a try.  Does do a good job reducing frizz, though.</li>
            <li> I use this to tame my out of control hair.  It keeps the curls with just the right amount of hold without any frizz.</li>
            <li> Love the stuff.  I use it before blow-drying, and as a styling agent , then just finger comb.</li>
            <li> I bought this item trusting the GF name, because some of their other products have worked well for me. This is definitely not the case with the Curl Calm Down cream. My hair has multiple thick layers so I must use a lot of the cream to be thorough, but the main things I noticed were:&lt;br /&gt;1). The cream is hard to pull through my hair&lt;br /&gt;2). It does almost nothing to tame the frizz&lt;br /&gt;3). It weighs my hair down so much that my natural curls turn into mild waves&lt;br /&gt;4). My hair feels greasy for the rest of the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only positive aspect is that it smells good. Overall this product is not worth the money I paid at almost $4 a bottle. This is probably best for someone with thin hair, though I don&#x27;t see many people with thin curly hair.</li>
            <li> I have very difficult curly-frizzy hair and this stuff really helped to calm down the frizz while not taking away my volume.  It was the only product I had to use after washing my hair to get great results and it left my hair feeling really soft all day.  For best results I would pat dry my hair with a towel after washing, then scrunch my hair with the product and either blow dry with a diffuser or let air dry--my best results were with air drying.  I also found that I could go easier without washing for a couple of days when I used this stuff too and very rarely on those days did I have to put more in to finish the look, I seriously would just kind of get up and go. Can&#x27;t argue with the price either...and I looked in Wal-Mart for this stuff on my last grocery shopping trip and I don&#x27;t know about your stores, but the one I went to did not have it so I will be ordering mine from amazon only I guess :)</li>
            <li> I normally use Wonder Waves by Garnier Fructis, which is fantastic by the way, but as the weather got more humid I needed a little more help.  Curl Calm Down cream is the best leave in conditioner anti-friz product I have ever tried!  I put this in my damp hair, followed by the wonder waves spray and I have the softest defined friz free curls ever!</li>
            <li> My hair is curly, and you guessed it, frizzy. Especially when I let it air dry. But this product helps a lot! It is basically like leave-in conditioner. It is not a miracle worker, but my hair is 95% less frizzy when it is left to dry by itself.</li>
            <li> Used it once, and promptly threw it in the garbage the next day.  This curl cream did hold my 3b/c curls, but gave them no definition or life.  In the end all I had were frizzy, dry curls...which was amazing because I run oil, and conditioner through my hair before applying any styling aide for all day moisture.  This curl cream was a total failure.</li>
            <li> This is a suitable product for dougla hair. It causes hair to be moist, manageable and leaves it with a nice fragrance. Even my bf uses this product and he is east indian, it is great!!!!!</li>
            <li> I use this product whenever I curl or straighten my hair. Curls turn into spirals whenever I do use this product and there are fewer stray-aways when I straighten my hair.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;I was losing the life in my curls and my frizz was hard to tame.  When I use this product, my hair looks sooo shiny and my curls look awesome without leaving any buildup or grease. My hair is soft to the touch also.  I use it when I come out the shower and scrunch it in.  I hope they never discontinue this product.</li>
            <li> Good stuff for curly frizzy hair, but not good for roots as it can make your roots just a touch greasy. I work through all my hair, then add mousse to roots and a bit more all over, then blow dry with diffuser. This product works all day, in fact after a few hours, I think it then begins to work even better. This is also good for some sprucing up in the afternoon or evening.</li>
            <li> This product works pretty good but it does get a bit crunchy without combing through which then makes the curls frizzier</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t help with frizz at all..</li>
            <li> For years I have searched in vain for a product that defines my curls without turning my hair into a crunchy, wet-looking mess. Thankfully I finally found Garnier Curl Calm Down! I have long, thick hair and I find that a pump and a half to two pumps is all I need.* I scrunch it gently into wet hair. Usually I sleep on it and wake up with soft, natural (less frizzy) curls, but the best method is to wet your hair in the morning, then apply it and go about your day. By the time my hair dries, my curls have amazing definition and body--and it doesn&#x27;t look or feel like there&#x27;s anything in my hair (the only giveaway is the nice sweet but subtle scent)! I never used to be able to shower then go on my way (my hair would dry in a crazy, frizzy mess), but now it&#x27;s my best look! I can&#x27;t say enough good about this product. Unfortunately, for some reason it is no longer sold in supermarkets/pharmacies in my area. Fortunately, though, Amazon sells it for a reasonable price. Try it if you want curl definition without the greasy crunch!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I should mention that I have very soft hair, so I don&#x27;t need a whole lot of taming, but for someone with very kinky/wiry hair, this product might not offer enough hold.</li>
            <li> I have fine, curly, frizzy hair...the kind that turns into a frizz bomb at the slightest hint of humidity. If I don&#x27;t take care it looks like a very bad, over timed perm. And I haven&#x27;t had a perm for 29 years. Seriously bad. This product works better than any salon product I have tried, and I have tried a LOT! This is the first product that doesn&#x27;t feel greasy or sticky, and doesn&#x27;t stop working even after I sleep on it. I also love the Fructis anti frizz hairspray. It helps hold the curls and define them without weighting them down and making them look drab. Great products that are affordable. Strongly recommended!</li>
            <li> holds my hair in place when I need it too</li>
