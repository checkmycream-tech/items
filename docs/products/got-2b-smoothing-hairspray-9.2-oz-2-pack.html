            <li>smells wonderful but doesn&#x27;t hold hair like normal hairspray.</li>
            <li>LOVE, LOVE, LOVE THIS STUFF!</li>
            <li>I used to clean hotel rooms, I had decided to cut my hair shorter but wanted to have a good hair spray to keep in</li>
            <li>Love this hairspray.</li>
            <li>Absolutely love this hairspray.</li>
            <li>love it.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this stuff for years and absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>Have not been able to find this hairspray in stores any more.</li>
            <li>I love the smell and hold of this product.</li>
            <li>So glad to have found it online.</li>
            <li>The scent can be overwhelming if you don&#x27;t like fragrance or floral/sweet smells.  </li>
            <li>Love this spray holds yet is flexible.</li>
            <li>My mom favorite hairspray</li>
            <li>I LOVE the product but not the price here.</li>
            <li>I say more?  </li>
            <li>I LOVE THIS SPRAY...</li>
            <li>Great hair spray from Got2b and does not leave your hair sticky, love this hairspray and would highly recommend this hairspray to anyone who thinking about buying it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried all kinds of hairsprays, and this is by far my favorite!!</li>
            <li>Schwartzkopf has another line, Schwartzkopf, and their strong hold hairspray is $30.  </li>
            <li>is a great topper over my regular mousse.</li>
            <li>It is light and flexible.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Getting it in a 2-pack, delivered to my door with free shipping.....</li>
            <li>Best hairspray for me...holds without being sticky or stiff.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have a super strong hold so that is the only reason I couldn&#x27;t give it 5 starts, but it&#x27;s perfect for light hold and lasting all day.</li>
            <li>This is a good deal on Amazon because I can no longer find this spray in my local stores.  </li>
            <li>always holds, can be brushed through, and smells lovely :)</li>
            <li>i honestly would buy it at double the price.</li>
            <li>If Amazon is ever out of stock look somewhere else because it is so worth it.</li>
            <li>i usually pay a lot more to get the kind of quality and hold this product</li>
            <li>Most hairsprays have that weird smell- this one smells light and airy and SO good.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t my #1 pick to use during the unbearably hot and humid Louisiana summers however it is a great flexible hold for hair pulled back or loosely braided in super humid temps.</li>
            <li>And water is one of the first ingredients, hmmm.  </li>
            <li>hot tools or chi iron on it.</li>
            <li>2 bottles down the tubes, but still my favorite spray!</li>
            <li>It dries light and soft, leaving my hair very \\&quot;touchable,\\&quot; but still under control.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d been using the same brand of hairspray for many years, but after discovering Smooth Operator, it&#x27;s the only hairspray I use now!!!</li>
            <li>However, I think the product is being discontinued as it is no longer in stores, so you may not be able to get it for very long.</li>
            <li>It also makes your hair super soft-</li>
            <li>I use it for just about everything, but especially for lightly spraying my curly hair with it to lock in the curls and keep out humidity</li>
            <li>It does not leave a residue and gently holds your sleek style in place.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like products on my hair but this hair spray is very touchable.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really describe-</li>
            <li>How much are you supposed to spray??</li>
            <li>/&gt;It was in my hands so fast</li>
            <li>It has a very gentle hold, not stiff or sticky or heavy, and has a nice fragrance as well.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a strong enough hold to keep my wild, curly hair in place, but not leave it crusty or crunchy.</li>
            <li>have to rinse in warm water... usually fixes it.  </li>
            <li>Love that it&#x27;s not sticky and holds my beach waves all day but does not stick my baby hairs down</li>
            <li>i highly recommend this.</li>
            <li>I ordered some new kind of got to be hairspray, both cans would not spray, I do not see my credit on these 2 cans, if it will not spray, then it is no good to me</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>It holds style well while allowing hair to remain soft throughout the day.  </li>
            <li>this hairspray has a soft hold &amp; doesnt make your hair sticky.</li>
            <li>again i have thick curly hair, and i wear it short when i wear it med size i tend to use a little more of this product .</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I have long, curly hair and this hairspray</li>
            <li> which is the opposite of other hairsprays that make your hair crispy or sticky-</li>
            <li> This will be my go to for fall and winter - straightened or long, loose, and wavy styled</li>
            <li> About 75% of all the women that stayed at my (above average) hotel used this hair spray.</li>
            <li> My hair is thick and naturally wavy</li>
            <li> I used this stuff in high school for seriously gravity defying hair and have been so upset that I have been unable to find the hairspray since, the Cashmere infused line still exists, just not the hairspray, apparently.</li>
            <li> but I am unable to find it in any stores locally.</li>
            <li> But it is really hard to find.</li>
            <li> I have never liked sprays that coat my hair in a shield of stiffness.  </li>
            <li> She had me order her 2 double packs, she is afraid they are going to stop making it.</li>
            <li> i have thick curly hair</li>
            <li> I think this stuff was discontinued, so I&#x27;m trying to buy as much as I can before it&#x27;s impossible to get!</li>
            <li> or is it just the bad quality??</li>

            <li> love it.  spray &amp;#34;hole&amp;#34; clogs all the time.  have to rinse in warm water... usually fixes it.  2 bottles down the tubes, but still my favorite spray!</li>
            <li> I think this stuff was discontinued, so I&#x27;m trying to buy as much as I can before it&#x27;s impossible to get! I have been using this stuff for years and absolutely love it. I have long, curly hair and this hairspray is a great topper over my regular mousse. It smells fantastic and I&#x27;m always getting compliments on how great my hair smells. It doesn&#x27;t make your hair crunchy, but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using it alone. Definitely use a different product beforehand.</li>
            <li> Have not been able to find this hairspray in stores any more. I love the smell and hold of this product. So glad to have found it online.</li>
            <li> I have never liked sprays that coat my hair in a shield of stiffness.  It builds up over time and is a pain to wash out.  This spray is just perfect.  It holds style well while allowing hair to remain soft throughout the day.  Great for keeping the fly aways at bay.  The scent can be overwhelming if you don&#x27;t like fragrance or floral/sweet smells.  It doesn&#x27;t bother me.  It&#x27;s rather nice.  This is a good deal on Amazon because I can no longer find this spray in my local stores.  Recommend.</li>

            <li> Love this spray holds yet is flexible. I don&#x27;t like products on my hair but this hair spray is very touchable.</li>
            <li> My mom favorite hairspray and we couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere around here so I told her I would look on line for her and of course Amazon had it. She had me order her 2 double packs, she is afraid they are going to stop making it.</li>
            <li> I ordered some new kind of got to be hairspray, both cans would not spray, I do not see my credit on these 2 cans, if it will not spray, then it is no good to me</li>
            <li> The smell of this stuff I can&#x27;t really describe- but it is amazing. Most hairsprays have that weird smell- this one smells light and airy and SO good. It also makes your hair super soft- which is the opposite of other hairsprays that make your hair crispy or sticky- this one doesnt. It holds well and doesnt give you that crunchy feeling- it cant get any better than that in my book!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t like the fruity scent.</li>
            <li> Woow and Woow , excellent product. i have thick curly hair however i wear my hair short. this product does the job excellent. you don&#x27;t need to use a lot of it just a lil and you are set. i usually pay a lot more to get the kind of quality and hold this product gives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  plus it smells great. i highly recommend this. don&#x27;t think twice about it, it is a treasure. again i have thick curly hair, and i wear it short when i wear it med size i tend to use a little more of this product . but like i said it is excellent i honestly would buy it at double the price.</li>
            <li> This is the only Hairspray that doesn&#x27;t make my scalp itch! I used to buy it at Rite Aid but I am unable to find it in any stores locally. I LOVE the product but not the price here. In stores it was only about $5 a can.</li>
            <li> This hairspray has water in it.  Why would you spray water on your finished style?  Need I say more?  And water is one of the first ingredients, hmmm.  Why do companies do this?  The Got2be Freeze spray doesn&#x27;t have water, and it holds great.  Schwartzkopf has another line, Schwartzkopf, and their strong hold hairspray is $30.  I&#x27;ll take the chance that they don&#x27;t make two completely different formulas but just change the packaging.  Why should I pay the premium price?  Skip this spray and go for the freeze spray in the yellow can.  No water.  And it works.</li>
            <li> Absolutely Love this hairspray! Great hold, no build up, you don&#x27;t have to use a ton, &amp; it keeps the frizzies away.&lt;br /&gt;Getting it in a 2-pack, delivered to my door with free shipping.....awesome!</li>
            <li> Love that it&#x27;s not sticky and holds my beach waves all day but does not stick my baby hairs down</li>
            <li> Wow! Great hair spray from Got2b and does not leave your hair sticky, love this hairspray and would highly recommend this hairspray to anyone who thinking about buying it. 100% Please...Will continue to buy this hairspray.</li>
            <li> Excellent!  smells wonderful but doesn&#x27;t hold hair like normal hairspray.</li>
            <li> Best hairspray for me...holds without being sticky or stiff. I used to buy it in the drugstore but can only find it on Amazon now.</li>
            <li> I got this for my mom as a gift.  She used it once at my house and she loved it.</li>
            <li> The best hairspray I have ever used. I used this stuff in high school for seriously gravity defying hair and have been so upset that I have been unable to find the hairspray since, the Cashmere infused line still exists, just not the hairspray, apparently. You can curl your hair and still run your fingers through your hair without messing up the hold or getting your fingers tangled in sticky hairs. Smells incredible and makes my hair feel amazing. If Amazon is ever out of stock look somewhere else because it is so worth it.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS SPRAY...IT LEAVES YOUR HAIR WITH BODY AND DEFINITE SHINE...IT FEELS LIKE HAIR..NOT STICKY OR CORSE FEELING......AND SMELLS GREAT! CAN&#x27;T FIND IT ANYWHERE ANYMORE....ONLY AT THROUGH AMAZON</li>
            <li> I spray a good amount on my hair but it just wont stay up for longer than 20 min. How much are you supposed to spray?? or is it just the bad quality?? (I style my hair by lifting up my short bangs and pushing them to the sides)</li>
            <li> I used to clean hotel rooms, I had decided to cut my hair shorter but wanted to have a good hair spray to keep in it check. About 75% of all the women that stayed at my (above average) hotel used this hair spray. So I gave it a chance and have never looked back. LOVE, LOVE, LOVE THIS STUFF!</li>
            <li> this hairspray has a soft hold &amp; doesnt make your hair sticky. oh &amp; it smells wonderful. i will buy it again</li>
            <li> Awesome hairspray. Not crunchy.</li>
            <li> My favorite hairspray! Found it in several places when I lived in Texas but can&#x27;t find it anywhere in here Louisiana. I&#x27;m so happy to have found it online for a great price! It isn&#x27;t my #1 pick to use during the unbearably hot and humid Louisiana summers however it is a great flexible hold for hair pulled back or loosely braided in super humid temps. You get the picture. I&#x27;ll always keep this stocked. My hair is thick and naturally wavy and when I style it I use a 2&amp;#34; hot tools or chi iron on it. This will be my go to for fall and winter - straightened or long, loose, and wavy styled hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was in my hands so fast and I love the twin pack! Great buy. Great seller!</li>
            <li> would buy again just as described and on time</li>
