            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased many of these over years. Was not pleased with last purchase prior to this one.  After some debating, I decided to place another order for this shaver via Amazon.  I was very pleased with this seller and so far, I&#x27;ve not had a problem with the shaver.</li>
            <li> Works great.  I higher recommend.</li>
            <li> Love this works very efficently and does the job  This is my 3rd one the others just wore out</li>
            <li> Fast and efficient, as long as the batteries are fresh.</li>
            <li> It did not work even when I tried my own batteries.</li>
            <li> This is the second one that I have.  Only reason that I had to buy another one was because I dropped the first one,  It still works but the on off switch broke in the fall.  But I loved this shaver so much that I had to have another one.</li>
            <li> It is a great little trimmer. I love it. This is my second one</li>
            <li> very satisfied with the shaver.  i would buy again if needed.</li>
            <li> I purchased this Lady Shaver many years ago on a TV show, and loved it then.  After the small mesh screen on it recently got damaged, I was so happy to find Amazon carrying this item!  I highly recommend this shaver.  Because of the excellent results and safety, I am considering purchasing another one for a teenager.</li>
            <li> I already have used this for many years and finally needed new one. This time I got 2.</li>
            <li> This is my fourth one. Two were gifts and the other two were for me so I could have a spare. I&#x27;ve had mine for at least a 6-7 years and it&#x27;s still going strong. I just recently bought the second one just to have.</li>
            <li> when i first turned it on i was scared. its sound and vibration was loud and strong, my hand was shaking. its shaves pretty good and there are some hairs left behind but its good. with long hairs it kinds hurts when you use it. so when i shave my legs i first shave a quick touch up with a razor then i use the trimmer. and so from there weekly i use it because it doesnt hurt as much with little to no hair. great product recommend</li>
            <li> I use on my face.  It works very well.</li>
            <li> Great product I just love it !! Thanx</li>
            <li> Works well.  I&#x27;m not a fancy person - I just need a product that gets the job done.  Very pleased and very affordable.</li>
