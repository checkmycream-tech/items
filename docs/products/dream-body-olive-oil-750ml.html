            <li>It&#x27;s amazing</li>
            <li>It leaves your skin well hydrated and smelling amazing.</li>
            <li>This is the absolute best lotion ever.</li>
            <li>I particularly liked the Vitamin A &amp; E ultra moisturizer Hydratant Ultra.</li>
            <li>Nice lotion.</li>
            <li>I even use it on my face, it is not greasy and absorbs nicely into your skin.</li>
            <li>It absorbs nicely into my skin and is not</li>
            <li>This product has a nice texture but smells very strongly and does not moisturize your skin well.</li>
            <li>Love the lotion, but despite good shipping materials, top of pump arrived cracked; had to tape it to use.</li>
            <li>Liked that is wasn&#x27;t greasy or sticky, absorbed quickly and smelled great!  </li>
            <li>but I have to say by far this is the best</li>
            <li>by far the best I have ever used.</li>
            <li>Such a great product and a great price, too.</li>
            <li>kept staring into the mirror , it seemed to good to be true .</li>
            <li>In the winter it makes my hands very smooth.  </li>
            <li>Everyone is in love with the lotion.  </li>
            <li>the smell is refreshing.  </li>
            <li>While I have my favorite stand-by lotions that I use, I&#x27;m a junkie when it comes to body lotions :)</li>
            <li>and I think he uses it as often or more than I do.</li>
            <li>I am sure Amazon has information about the origin</li>
            <li>Love, Love this lotion.  </li>
            <li>and the heat is coming on, I&#x27;m glad I found this cream.  </li>

            <li>When I run out, I will be buying more</li>
            <li>My husband and I use it and love it.</li>
            <li>But it is a wonderful lotion that I use especially on my face..</li>
            <li>He always comments on the citrus smell as it&#x27;s so refreshing.</li>
            <li>I have noticed the skin on my face to be so smooth with no redness!</li>
            <li>Love the scent.</li>
            <li>While it does its job moisturizing, it leaves a residue like most lotions/ moisturizer.</li>
            <li>The scent is more citrus-y (which I don&#x27;t mind).</li>
            <li>My six month grand daughter now uses the product .</li>
            <li>Love this....</li>
            <li>Must order more.</li>

            <li>I went and read some of the reviews and many seem to be identical (look for the &amp;#34;Five Stars&amp;#34; titles)</li>

            <li>Absolutely love it leaves your skin feeling smooth  and regenerated</li>
            <li>Leaves your hands super soft &amp; has a pleasant smell!</li>
            <li>I used at the nail place that I go to and loved it so much...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other creams but this is truly the best; the pump bottle makes it so easy to use.</li>
            <li>It goes on nice, dries and leaves your skin nice and soft.</li>
            <li>It goes on easy and keeps skin moist without that greasy feeling.</li>
            <li>fresh smelling, goes on smoothly and absorbs nicely.</li>
            <li>and it has a strong (too strong in my opinion)</li>
            <li>I love the smell of the lotion and fell in love right away</li>
            <li>The best I&#x27;ve achieved is to smooth my skin  temporarily and  slightly, but still have always had the appearance of redness and spots all over the backs of my arms and my legs.</li>
            <li>lotion is really awesome, and will probably be one of the few products I purchase again and again!&lt;br /</li>
            <li>it has a light, citrus (orange) scent.</li>
            <li>I have light olive skin and this cream is a DREAM for all seasons.</li>
            <li>It definitely work great for skin dryness.</li>
            <li>Lotion has a light scent that gets lighter as you wear it.</li>
            <li>If you want a good hand product that is MADE IN THE USA and the ingredients are clearly spelled out, try KISS MY FACE products.</li>
            <li>Smells nice, and a big size, nice prize.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended product with the great price for large size lotion.</li>
            <li>Spreads easy and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>I enjoyed it very much.</li>
            <li>Just tried this lotion this morning after a shower, for the first time, after receiving it as a gift, and I LOVE it.</li>
            <li>This is an ordinary lotion at best.</li>
            <li>not too greasy just right!</li>
            <li>* perfect consistency, not too thick,</li>
            <li>I have a problem with smells and some give me headaches this not only smells good</li>
            <li>It is super hydrating and</li>
            <li>This lotion absorbs quickly, it isn&#x27;t greasy, and doesn&#x27;t have an overpowering scent.</li>
            <li>Apparently, they have changed the fragrance, and I must say it is not to nice.  </li>
            <li>At first I noticed my skin feeling smooth</li>
            <li>/&gt;Smiles from Staten Island New York &#x3D; )</li>
            <li>&gt;* absorbed quickly</li>
            <li>Very soft skin  Love this product  </li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon - I bought 5!!</li>
            <li>and I felt so smooth the whole day and</li>
            <li>My skin is so soft and makes me feel better about myself..  </li>
            <li>Although the cream is nice, I feel that there is definitely \\&quot;something fishy in Denmark\\&quot; (or in R.O.P.C</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not convinced that this product is &amp;#34;all natural&amp;#34; and appropriate for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>right?</li>
            <li>The effect of the lotion on your skin is noticeable right away.</li>
            <li>I knew that olive oil is good for people who have extremely dry skin or are allergic to topical creams and lotions, so gave it a try and fell in love with it.</li>
            <li>and it was worth every penny ;)</li>
            <li>I bought this lotion for my wife and she like it very much.</li>
            <li>let my father to use this product just for one time and he like it very much.</li>
            <li>yes it&#x27;s LOTION, not oil ;)</li>
            <li>Any input will be appreciated!  </li>
            <li>A girlfriend if mine ordered it first and allowed me to try it</li>
            <li>I like citrus fragrance, but this cream has such an overwelming lime fragrance that I cannot use the cream anymore, which is a shame because the cream itself is outstanding.</li>
            <li>This lotion really soaks into my skin without leaving an oily residue!</li>
            <li>Finally was able to buy this on online.  </li>
            <li>and I will purchase again as this is my first time using Dream Body Olive Oil.</li>
            <li>It has an evident perfume scent</li>
            <li>If you have suffered with KP please give this product a try , buy the big bottle as I know you will love it.</li>
            <li>I was given the first bottle as a gift and had to search the internet for another when I ran out.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m curious to know what ingredient is responsible for this amazing transformation to my skin, I&#x27;m thinking its the olive oil</li>
            <li>Charging nearly $12 for a 750 ml bottle is outrageous---Amazon was kind enough to refund some of it.</li>
            <li>It has a more oily texture than usual, which takes time to absorb and isn&#x27;t too comfortable on the skin.</li>
            <li>the bottle is large, so you get a lot for your money</li>
            <li>I got the large bottle.</li>
            <li>I have been using it ever since and bought this large bottle</li>
            <li>My hands are always rough, since I have been using this they are once again soft...  Love it !</li>
            <li>Thanks again.</li>
            <li>it also soaks in well and keeps your skin smooth the entire day.</li>
            <li>Thanks for reading.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s much in there</li>
            <li>But not feel too much about olive.</li>
            <li>and I did not find it very moisturizing.</li>
            <li>I really like this lotion a lot.</li>
            <li>I had applied too much</li>
            <li>it works fast and is not greasy like most other products...</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s a decent price for a large bottle.</li>
            <li>Love this cream and was half the price</li>
            <li>had some difficulty finding it but finally found it on amazon  quick delivery also.</li>
            <li>I I have suffered with KP for most of my teen and adult life and have tried everything to get rid of it .I was at the point of really just giving up and living with the redness , bumps and trying not to constantly pick at the keratin plugs that build up around each hair follicle!</li>
            <li>I highly suggest the pump ship separately with the product.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t expect much when I bought it, and I was pleasantly surprised at how well it worked.</li>
            <li>Works well and really makes your skin soft.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my sister since she loves it and normally buys it from her nail salon.</li>
            <li>Only complaint is that it is a little greasy, other than that I love love love this stuff!</li>
            <li>So soft!</li>
            <li>Since using this lotion, they have completely disappeared.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d be surprised if you don&#x27;t like it.  </li>
            <li>It soaks in to my skin and makes it so soft...</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin feeling soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li>but there&#x27;s nothing listed in the ingredients that suggests what might be emitting this scent... which makes me suspect that the whole label is totally a marketing hoax:</li>
            <li>It is far from all natural</li>
            <li>no mention of a manufacturer, an address, or even a country of origin, it&#x27;s full of typos and looks like a typical knock-off coming from China.</li>
            <li>Not an overwhelming scent and a little hoes a long way.</li>
            <li>I think there are equally moisturizing and fragrance free products out there from companies that are less, well, sketchy.</li>
            <li>A bit underhanded but as long as we like the lotion, perhaps it really doesn&#x27;t matter...</li>
            <li>I emailed the company through Amazon and received a somewhat curt reply that they would either mail me a new pump or give me a $5 credit towards my next order.</li>
            <li>So I went back to my old body lotion and the symptoms disappeared.</li>
            <li>/&gt;remarkably soft and soothed, and YOUNGER!</li>
            <li>I have found that I don&#x27;t have to use the lotion everyday to keep my skin nice although I will see a tiny bit of redness come back if I skip a few days , but even then my skin stays soft .</li>
            <li>I love this lotion but the pump was broken during shipment.  </li>
            <li>I think my skin has really gotten soft and less wrinkled.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s  very concentrated so little goes a long way, the price is very cheap.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really hope they continue to manufacture this lotion for a long time!!!!!</li>
            <li>I am 70 years old and have fought dry skin forever.  </li>
            <li>I have used almost every product on the market for my dry sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>After trying several different all natural lotions that did nothing for my dry winter skin I purchased this after going for a mani and pedi.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> It&#x27;s amazing</li>
            <li> It leaves your skin well hydrated and smelling amazing.</li>
            <li> This is the absolute best lotion ever.</li>
            <li> I particularly liked the Vitamin A &amp; E ultra moisturizer Hydratant Ultra.</li>
            <li> Nice lotion.</li>
            <li> I even use it on my face, it is not greasy and absorbs nicely into your skin.</li>
            <li> It absorbs nicely into my skin and is not</li>
            <li> This product has a nice texture but smells very strongly and does not moisturize your skin well.</li>
            <li> Love the lotion, but despite good shipping materials, top of pump arrived cracked; had to tape it to use.</li>
            <li> Liked that is wasn&#x27;t greasy or sticky, absorbed quickly and smelled great!  </li>
            <li> but I have to say by far this is the best</li>
            <li> by far the best I have ever used.</li>
            <li> Such a great product and a great price, too.</li>
            <li> kept staring into the mirror , it seemed to good to be true .</li>
            <li> In the winter it makes my hands very smooth.  </li>
            <li> Everyone is in love with the lotion.  </li>
            <li> the smell is refreshing.  </li>
            <li> While I have my favorite stand-by lotions that I use, I&#x27;m a junkie when it comes to body lotions :)</li>
            <li> and I think he uses it as often or more than I do.</li>
            <li> I am sure Amazon has information about the origin</li>
            <li> Love, Love this lotion.  </li>
            <li> and the heat is coming on, I&#x27;m glad I found this cream.  </li>
            <li> Enjoy!</li>
            <li> When I run out, I will be buying more</li>
            <li> My husband and I use it and love it.</li>
            <li> But it is a wonderful lotion that I use especially on my face..</li>
            <li> He always comments on the citrus smell as it&#x27;s so refreshing.</li>
            <li> I have noticed the skin on my face to be so smooth with no redness!</li>
            <li> Love the scent.</li>
            <li> While it does its job moisturizing, it leaves a residue like most lotions/ moisturizer.</li>
            <li> The scent is more citrus-y (which I don&#x27;t mind).</li>
            <li> My six month grand daughter now uses the product .</li>
            <li> Love this....</li>
            <li> Must order more.</li>

            <li> and so i love it..</li>
            <li> I went and read some of the reviews and many seem to be identical (look for the &amp;#34;Five Stars&amp;#34; titles)</li>

            <li> Absolutely love it leaves your skin feeling smooth  and regenerated</li>
            <li> Leaves your hands super soft &amp; has a pleasant smell!</li>
            <li> I used at the nail place that I go to and loved it so much...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other creams but this is truly the best; the pump bottle makes it so easy to use.</li>
            <li> It goes on nice, dries and leaves your skin nice and soft.</li>
            <li> It goes on easy and keeps skin moist without that greasy feeling.</li>
            <li> fresh smelling, goes on smoothly and absorbs nicely.</li>
            <li> and it has a strong (too strong in my opinion)</li>
            <li> I love the smell of the lotion and fell in love right away</li>
            <li> The best I&#x27;ve achieved is to smooth my skin  temporarily and  slightly, but still have always had the appearance of redness and spots all over the backs of my arms and my legs.</li>
            <li> lotion is really awesome, and will probably be one of the few products I purchase again and again!&lt;br /</li>
            <li> it has a light, citrus (orange) scent.</li>
            <li> I have light olive skin and this cream is a DREAM for all seasons.</li>
            <li> It definitely work great for skin dryness.</li>
            <li> Lotion has a light scent that gets lighter as you wear it.</li>
            <li> If you want a good hand product that is MADE IN THE USA and the ingredients are clearly spelled out, try KISS MY FACE products.</li>
            <li> Smells nice, and a big size, nice prize.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended product with the great price for large size lotion.</li>
            <li> Spreads easy and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> I enjoyed it very much.</li>
            <li> Just tried this lotion this morning after a shower, for the first time, after receiving it as a gift, and I LOVE it.</li>
            <li> This is an ordinary lotion at best.</li>
            <li> not too greasy just right!</li>
            <li> * perfect consistency, not too thick,</li>
            <li> I have a problem with smells and some give me headaches this not only smells good</li>
            <li> It is super hydrating and</li>
            <li> This lotion absorbs quickly, it isn&#x27;t greasy, and doesn&#x27;t have an overpowering scent.</li>
            <li> Apparently, they have changed the fragrance, and I must say it is not to nice.  </li>
            <li> At first I noticed my skin feeling smooth</li>
            <li> /&gt;Smiles from Staten Island New York &#x3D; )</li>
            <li> &gt;* absorbed quickly</li>
            <li> Very soft skin  Love this product  </li>
            <li> Thanks Amazon - I bought 5!!</li>
            <li> and I felt so smooth the whole day and</li>
            <li> My skin is so soft and makes me feel better about myself..  </li>
            <li> Although the cream is nice, I feel that there is definitely \\&quot;something fishy in Denmark\\&quot; (or in R.O.P.C</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not convinced that this product is &amp;#34;all natural&amp;#34; and appropriate for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> right?</li>
            <li> The effect of the lotion on your skin is noticeable right away.</li>
            <li> I knew that olive oil is good for people who have extremely dry skin or are allergic to topical creams and lotions, so gave it a try and fell in love with it.</li>
            <li> and it was worth every penny ;)</li>
            <li> I bought this lotion for my wife and she like it very much.</li>
            <li> let my father to use this product just for one time and he like it very much.</li>
            <li> yes it&#x27;s LOTION, not oil ;)</li>
            <li> Any input will be appreciated!  </li>
            <li> A girlfriend if mine ordered it first and allowed me to try it</li>
            <li> I like citrus fragrance, but this cream has such an overwelming lime fragrance that I cannot use the cream anymore, which is a shame because the cream itself is outstanding.</li>
            <li> This lotion really soaks into my skin without leaving an oily residue!</li>
            <li> Finally was able to buy this on online.  </li>
            <li> and I will purchase again as this is my first time using Dream Body Olive Oil.</li>
            <li> It has an evident perfume scent</li>
            <li> If you have suffered with KP please give this product a try , buy the big bottle as I know you will love it.</li>
            <li> I was given the first bottle as a gift and had to search the internet for another when I ran out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m curious to know what ingredient is responsible for this amazing transformation to my skin, I&#x27;m thinking its the olive oil</li>
            <li> Charging nearly $12 for a 750 ml bottle is outrageous---Amazon was kind enough to refund some of it.</li>
            <li> It has a more oily texture than usual, which takes time to absorb and isn&#x27;t too comfortable on the skin.</li>
            <li> the bottle is large, so you get a lot for your money</li>
            <li> I got the large bottle.</li>
            <li> I have been using it ever since and bought this large bottle</li>
            <li> My hands are always rough, since I have been using this they are once again soft...  Love it !</li>
            <li> Thanks again.</li>
            <li> it also soaks in well and keeps your skin smooth the entire day.</li>
            <li> Thanks for reading.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s much in there</li>
            <li> But not feel too much about olive.</li>
            <li> and I did not find it very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> I really like this lotion a lot.</li>
            <li> I had applied too much</li>
            <li> it works fast and is not greasy like most other products...</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s a decent price for a large bottle.</li>
            <li> Love this cream and was half the price</li>
            <li> had some difficulty finding it but finally found it on amazon  quick delivery also.</li>
            <li> I I have suffered with KP for most of my teen and adult life and have tried everything to get rid of it .I was at the point of really just giving up and living with the redness , bumps and trying not to constantly pick at the keratin plugs that build up around each hair follicle!</li>
            <li> I highly suggest the pump ship separately with the product.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect much when I bought it, and I was pleasantly surprised at how well it worked.</li>
            <li> Works well and really makes your skin soft.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my sister since she loves it and normally buys it from her nail salon.</li>
            <li> Only complaint is that it is a little greasy, other than that I love love love this stuff!</li>
            <li> So soft!</li>
            <li> Since using this lotion, they have completely disappeared.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d be surprised if you don&#x27;t like it.  </li>
            <li> It soaks in to my skin and makes it so soft...</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin feeling soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li> but there&#x27;s nothing listed in the ingredients that suggests what might be emitting this scent... which makes me suspect that the whole label is totally a marketing hoax:</li>
            <li> It is far from all natural</li>
            <li> no mention of a manufacturer, an address, or even a country of origin, it&#x27;s full of typos and looks like a typical knock-off coming from China.</li>
            <li> Not an overwhelming scent and a little hoes a long way.</li>
            <li> I think there are equally moisturizing and fragrance free products out there from companies that are less, well, sketchy.</li>
            <li> A bit underhanded but as long as we like the lotion, perhaps it really doesn&#x27;t matter...</li>
            <li> I emailed the company through Amazon and received a somewhat curt reply that they would either mail me a new pump or give me a $5 credit towards my next order.</li>
            <li> So I went back to my old body lotion and the symptoms disappeared.</li>
            <li> /&gt;remarkably soft and soothed, and YOUNGER!</li>
            <li> I have found that I don&#x27;t have to use the lotion everyday to keep my skin nice although I will see a tiny bit of redness come back if I skip a few days , but even then my skin stays soft .</li>
            <li> I love this lotion but the pump was broken during shipment.  </li>
            <li> I think my skin has really gotten soft and less wrinkled.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s  very concentrated so little goes a long way, the price is very cheap.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really hope they continue to manufacture this lotion for a long time!!!!!</li>
            <li> I am 70 years old and have fought dry skin forever.  </li>
            <li> I have used almost every product on the market for my dry sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> After trying several different all natural lotions that did nothing for my dry winter skin I purchased this after going for a mani and pedi.  </li>
            <li> My 50 year old daughter gave me a kiss the other day and said &amp;</li>
            <li> I thought of buying this product since I loved Body Shop&#x27;s olive beauty oil (unfortunately they just come in small bottles).</li>
            <li> the entire family loves it.i would reccommend this to everyone for has dry skin</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t mean to be too graphic, but this stuff works really well.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t clash with perfume&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For an ordinary looking lotion, it seems to really moisturize dry skin.</li>
            <li> i have been using this for a long time.  </li>
            <li> It works like a charm and it goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> My kids said my skin looked like a dry desert.  </li>
            <li> I use this every day on my skin to help with my dry skin.  </li>
            <li> RECCOMMEND FOR ANYONE WHO HAS SEVERE DRY SKIN.</li>
            <li> I started using Dream Body Oil because I figured it would help with dry skin.</li>
            <li> I have extremely dry skin</li>
            <li> He has dry itchy skin which happen every winter season</li>
            <li> One of my coworkers had a tube of dream dream lotion on his desk, I used it on my hands as they get really dry in the winter.</li>
            <li> I have a black skin that is quiet dry and needs a lot of moisturizing.</li>
            <li> I have chemical allergies &amp; very dry skin.</li>
            <li> If you have rough elbows or feet, this is for you.  </li>
            <li> I use to have dry, dark spots on my hand that I could never get rid of.</li>
            <li> But my hands get very dry after a days labor!</li>
            <li> There are grammatical errors on the packaging and, as noted by other reviewers, it says it&#x27;s made in R.O.P.C., but has a NY address.</li>
            <li> Also, this big bottle was shipped in a flimsy envelope that was way too small and was so mangled in transport</li>
            <li> I used alot of other products</li>
            <li> so I started applying a small amount to my face daily.</li>
            <li> For it&#x27;s intended use, you may want to consider this product, but for the scent, you may want to look for other products (unless you&#x27;re after a citrus-y smell).</li>
            <li> Like other reviewer, we don&#x27;t know whether this lotion is olive oil or not as it smell like lemon.</li>
            <li> I purchased this online a couple of weeks of go after reading the other reviews.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews and saw other people saying it helped their KP as well.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> I searched and searched a few months ago</li>
            <li> Not to mention the dead skin on my feet is virtually gone.</li>
            <li> It is a few dollars cheaper here.</li>
            <li> Being a cabinet maker this is a problem as you leave oily hand prints on raw wood that will show up when you stain and finish your project.</li>
            <li> I was given a small tube and it was $12.99.</li>
            <li> I bought a small tube from the salon which mind you,&lt;br /&gt;cost</li>
            <li> I have  been using this product on my arms and legs  for no more than 2 weeks</li>
            <li> my husband uses it too... not too thick</li>
            <li> Since it has been the cold winter months I find the skin on my face dry</li>
            <li> This is the only lotion I have found that helps my so dry,winter cracked, painful hands.</li>
            <li> scent wasn&#x27;t over powering, very subtle.</li>
            <li> Besides that, it is lousy.</li>
            <li> However, I&#x27;m skeptical of this lotion and the company.</li>
            <li> My manicurist decided to stop using because she felt it was too expensive to carry.</li>
            <li> how well one casual application&lt;br /&gt;Of</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been so bad that people have asked  me how I got such an awful rash.:(&lt;br /</li>
            <li> I know, crazy,  </li>
            <li> After about a month of using this products, and with the crazy cold winter we had this year, my skin started cracking and even hurting.</li>
            <li> I was a bit disappointed</li>
            <li> Smells terrible plus gave me a really bad allergy all over my body!</li>
            <li> It is a miracle since I grew up with terrible acne scars and now they have vanished!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I think my skin has really gotten soft and less wrinkled. I think this product is great</li>
            <li> I bought this lotion for my office.  We keep a lotion in a central location and everybody steals from it throughout the day.  Everyone is in love with the lotion.  It is super hydrating and the smell is refreshing.  You feel refreshed after applying.</li>
            <li> I have chemical allergies &amp; very dry skin. While I have my favorite stand-by lotions that I use, I&#x27;m a junkie when it comes to body lotions :)&lt;br /&gt;This lotion is really awesome, and will probably be one of the few products I purchase again and again!&lt;br /&gt;* the bottle is large, so you get a lot for your money&lt;br /&gt;* it has a light, citrus (orange) scent. I don&#x27;t like orange, but I find this smells very nice! Feminine, but not flowery&lt;br /&gt;* yes it&#x27;s LOTION, not oil ;)&lt;br /&gt;* it&#x27;s not sticky&lt;br /&gt;* perfect consistency, not too thick, not too thin&lt;br /&gt;* absorbed quickly&lt;br /&gt;* not greasy&lt;br /&gt;* scent wasn&#x27;t over powering, very subtle. Didn&#x27;t clash with perfume&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For an ordinary looking lotion, it seems to really moisturize dry skin. I didn&#x27;t expect much when I bought it, and I was pleasantly surprised at how well it worked.</li>
            <li> I was given this by my manicurist.  I am 70 years old and have fought dry skin forever.  My kids said my skin looked like a dry desert.  one use of this changed that.  Thank you.  My skin is so soft and makes me feel better about myself..  My 50 year old daughter gave me a kiss the other day and said &amp;#34;Mom, your skin is so soft&amp;#34;.  I use only this product and gave away all the rest of what I used.  Thanks again.</li>
            <li> Great cream...fresh smelling, goes on smoothly and absorbs nicely. I have introduced it to my husband and I think he uses it as often or more than I do. good thing I got the large bottle.</li>
            <li> This is the absolute best lotion ever. I searched and searched a few months ago and finally it came up via Google. Thanks Amazon - I bought 5!!</li>
            <li> dream body olive oil lotion.  i have been using this for a long time.  find it very good.  had some difficulty finding it but finally found it on amazon  quick delivery also.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B002A1FD1I Dream Body Olive Oil 750ml] There is an address of 54 Enter Lane, Islandia, NY 11749 on the Dream Body Olive Oil.  This leads to nothing.  Packaging claims it is \\&quot;made in R.O.P.C.\\&quot;  Have no idea where this is and neither does the internet!  Although the cream is nice, I feel that there is definitely \\&quot;something fishy in Denmark\\&quot; (or in R.O.P.C where ever it may be).  I am sure Amazon has information about the origin and I would like to know.  This product is sold in Korean nail salons and I wonder if the origin is Korea? Or could R.O.P.C. stand for Republic of Peoples China?  (I just made that up)! If so why not just say China (where everything else comes from anyway)!  I believe that there is a law in the US that country of origin must appear on all packaging.  Any input will be appreciated!  I spoke with the importer who said \\&quot;We don&#x27;t know what R.O.P.C. stands for, but it IS China. They don&#x27;t want to say China because it may harm sales as people are against Chinese imports\\&quot;!  A bit underhanded but as long as we like the lotion, perhaps it really doesn&#x27;t matter...</li>
            <li> Love, Love this lotion.  My nail salon uses this and gave me a tube for Christmas one year.  I have been using it ever since and bought this large bottle so I would not run out.  Your hands feel like silk and it smells so good.</li>
            <li> I love it! A girlfriend if mine ordered it first and allowed me to try it and it was worth every penny ;)</li>
            <li> OK..have no idea where this comes from, china probably...but had I noticed the misspelled ingredients: Isoplopyl instead of Isopropyl and Minral Oil, instead of Mineral Oil, I would NOT have bought it. Besides that, it is lousy. It did nothing for my skin, and after awhile, the smell gives me a headache.  If you want a good hand product that is MADE IN THE USA and the ingredients are clearly spelled out, try KISS MY FACE products. I particularly liked the Vitamin A &amp; E ultra moisturizer Hydratant Ultra.</li>
            <li> I use this every day on my skin to help with my dry skin.  It is the lotion they use in pedicure places.  It is great and it was a great price and received very quickly.  Packaging was great too.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for some time, and have been very happy with it.  It&#x27;s a wonderful skin cream.  Apparently, they have changed the fragrance, and I must say it is not to nice.  I like citrus fragrance, but this cream has such an overwelming lime fragrance that I cannot use the cream anymore, which is a shame because the cream itself is outstanding.</li>
            <li> I have been searching for this product for awhile online since finding it in my local nail salon. Thank you amazon. I tried this wonderful product one day and the light lemon smell is wonderful it also soaks in well and keeps your skin smooth the entire day.</li>
            <li> THIS IS A WONDERFUL PRODUCT.  NOT GREASY. BEST EVER GREAT SIZE FOR HANDBAG .hIGHLY RECCOMMEND FOR ANYONE WHO HAS SEVERE DRY SKIN.</li>
            <li> Love the lotion, but despite good shipping materials, top of pump arrived cracked; had to tape it to use.</li>
            <li> I started using Dream Body Oil because I figured it would help with dry skin. Turns out IT DID!!! I use to have dry, dark spots on my hand that I could never get rid of. Since using this lotion, they have completely disappeared. Not to mention the dead skin on my feet is virtually gone. I don&#x27;t mean to be too graphic, but this stuff works really well. Thanks for reading.</li>
            <li> There is a Beauty Supply in Chicago that sells this product exclusive in Chicago! (Rokman Beauty Supply) I believe they sell it for $9-10 dollars?</li>
            <li> Found this body lotion in a nail salon. Liked that is wasn&#x27;t greasy or sticky, absorbed quickly and smelled great!  So I picked up a bottle for $12.00.  Now that the temps are falling and the heat is coming on, I&#x27;m glad I found this cream.  My wife smelled it when she walked in the room, tried it and I had to buy her a bottle.  I&#x27;d be surprised if you don&#x27;t like it.  I can&#x27;t put my finger on it, but there&#x27;s something different about this stuff.  It works like a charm and it goes a long way.  Enjoy!</li>
            <li> My wife uses this product, and gave me a bottle for Christmas. It feels great, and smells good too. When I run out, I will be buying more</li>
            <li> I have a problem with smells and some give me headaches this not only smells good but it feels good on the body. not too greasy just right! bought for gifts also.</li>
            <li> This product is great. My husband and I use it and love it. After a good workout, you can shower and moisturize with it. It makes you smell and feel great too! It goes on nice, dries and leaves your skin nice and soft. Highy recommend it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll start off with what I see as positives of this product: It has a very nice feel, is moisturizing and not greasy, absorbs well. And it&#x27;s a decent price for a large bottle. However, I&#x27;m skeptical of this lotion and the company. It&#x27;s called, &amp;#34;Dream Olive Oil&amp;#34;, but olive oil is the last ingredient on the list, so I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s much in there and it has a strong (too strong in my opinion) citrus scent, as others have mentioned, but no fragrance or citrus ingredient is listed. I&#x27;m not convinced that this product is &amp;#34;all natural&amp;#34; and appropriate for sensitive skin. There are grammatical errors on the packaging and, as noted by other reviewers, it says it&#x27;s made in R.O.P.C., but has a NY address. Also, this big bottle was shipped in a flimsy envelope that was way too small and was so mangled in transport it&#x27;s a miracle the bottle stayed inside. The pump was cracked as a result and, although it worked, it was obvious that its days were numbered. I emailed the company through Amazon and received a somewhat curt reply that they would either mail me a new pump or give me a $5 credit towards my next order. I chose the pump and they did send it in a timely fashion. I will not order this again. I think there are equally moisturizing and fragrance free products out there from companies that are less, well, sketchy.</li>
            <li> Just tried this lotion this morning after a shower, for the first time, after receiving it as a gift, and I LOVE it. Not an overwhelming scent and a little hoes a long way. Spreads easy and absorbs quickly. Nice lotion.</li>
            <li> I love this body lotion! I was given a small tube and it was $12.99. When I went online and found a 750 ml bottle for $15 I was so happy! This lotion really soaks into my skin without leaving an oily residue! I know, crazy,  right? But it is a wonderful lotion that I use especially on my face.. It soaks in to my skin and makes it so soft... But no oily shine!</li>
            <li> Love this cream and was half the price</li>
            <li> It feels good. But not feel too much about olive. Smells nice, and a big size, nice prize. I like it.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my sister since she loves it and normally buys it from her nail salon. It is a few dollars cheaper here. Works well and really makes your skin soft. I use it too on my feet and then put socks on. So soft!</li>
            <li> The smell is really great I used alot of other products but I have to say by far this is the best</li>
            <li> Smells great. Will definitely buy it again in the future.</li>
            <li> and so does my husband. He always comments on the citrus smell as it&#x27;s so refreshing. The lotion feels great as well.</li>
            <li> I received a bottle of this lotion as a Christmas gift at the nail salon I routinely go to. Since it has been the cold winter months I find the skin on my face dry so I started applying a small amount to my face daily. I have noticed the skin on my face to be so smooth with no redness! It is a miracle since I grew up with terrible acne scars and now they have vanished!</li>
            <li> Excellent lotion. Love the scent. It goes on easy and keeps skin moist without that greasy feeling. I would buy again.</li>
            <li> What a bargain. This ccream is the best ever. I have light olive skin and this cream is a DREAM for all seasons. Not too greasy and creamy oil seeps into all the cracks. Love this product and bargain size for the price!</li>
            <li> I got the box and 1/2 the bottle spilled in the package.  I was a bit disappointed but I didn&#x27;t know what to do!!</li>
            <li> I thought of buying this product since I loved Body Shop&#x27;s olive beauty oil (unfortunately they just come in small bottles). This order came on time.  While it does its job moisturizing, it leaves a residue like most lotions/ moisturizer. The scent is totally NOT olive.  The scent is more citrus-y (which I don&#x27;t mind). For it&#x27;s intended use, you may want to consider this product, but for the scent, you may want to look for other products (unless you&#x27;re after a citrus-y smell).</li>
            <li> I love this body lotion! The scent is light &amp; moisturizes great. Only complaint is that it is a little greasy, other than that I love love love this stuff!</li>
            <li> I find myself ordering this every month as both my daughters can&#x27;t be without it. Nothing else seems to compare</li>
            <li> Only lotion that will stop my skin itch and it is not greasy. Great product . My six month grand daughter now uses the product .</li>
            <li> Love this....my nail salon uses it and I could not rest until I found it for myself. I have extremely dry skin and this doesn&#x27;t just disappear into my skin. This is great!!!!!</li>
            <li> Just what the professionals use at salons. Finally was able to buy this on online.  My manicurist decided to stop using because she felt it was too expensive to carry.</li>
            <li> I enjoyed it very much. Must order more.</li>
            <li> Dream dream is a cream and not an oil as said on the bottle..&lt;br /&gt;I returned this bottle and if any one needs a cream only then buy this product.</li>
            <li> great product thank you....  .I used it and it was good oil.  good for massage.  great product...love it... want to order more...</li>
            <li> Found this lotion in FL first and loved it, but could not find it in my area.  Great after bath moisturizer!</li>
            <li> My nail salon uses this product, and gave me a bottle for Christmas.  It feels great, and smells good too.  When I run out, I will be buying more.</li>
            <li> I tried this when I got a pedicure and they rubbed it&lt;br /&gt;on my feet and leg and I felt so smooth the whole day and&lt;br /&gt;even the next! I bought a small tube from the salon which mind you,&lt;br /&gt;cost more then Amazon. I then decided to purchase it on Amazon and&lt;br /&gt;buy the bigger one and I am happy I did! I use it every day!&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this it is not greasy at all and really is great for your skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smiles from Staten Island New York &#x3D; )</li>
            <li> Smells like Pledge and I did not find it very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> This product is outstanding!</li>
            <li> This product has a nice texture but smells very strongly and does not moisturize your skin well. I have a black skin that is quiet dry and needs a lot of moisturizing. After about a month of using this products, and with the crazy cold winter we had this year, my skin started cracking and even hurting. So I went back to my old body lotion and the symptoms disappeared.</li>
            <li> This is the best all over body lotion. I even use it on my face, it is not greasy and absorbs nicely into your skin. Too me, this is the best brand and I will purchase again as this is my first time using Dream Body Olive Oil.</li>
            <li> If you have rough elbows or feet, this is for you.  My daughter recommended it to me and am very happy with it.  Would gladly recommend to anyone and have.</li>
            <li> My Wife wanted to try this product and loves it. I&#x27;ve always had a problem with hand lotions leaving my hands greasy or oily. Being a cabinet maker this is a problem as you leave oily hand prints on raw wood that will show up when you stain and finish your project. But my hands get very dry after a days labor! This \\&quot;Dream Body Olive Oil\\&quot; works great and doesn&#x27;t smell all girly either. Love this stuff!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The CabinetMan</li>
            <li> I love it and use it every day after I shower.  It has a lemony smell and is a great consistency.  It absorbs nicely into my skin and is not</li>
            <li> I bought this lotion for my wife and she like it very much. Like other reviewer, we don&#x27;t know whether this lotion is olive oil or not as it smell like lemon. Anyway it smell good. It definitely work great for skin dryness. Perfect for winter.&lt;br /&gt;I let my father to use this product just for one time and he like it very much. He has dry itchy skin which happen every winter season and there is no lotion relieve this problem until we get this dream body olive oil. I buy anther bottle for my dad. Highly recommended product with the great price for large size lotion.</li>
            <li> It smells really good... I knew that olive oil is good for people who have extremely dry skin or are allergic to topical creams and lotions, so gave it a try and fell in love with it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so in love with this product .. It&#x27;s amazing</li>
            <li> I purchased this online a couple of weeks of go after reading the other reviews. I really like this lotion a lot. It leaves my skin feeling soft and moisturized. This lotion absorbs quickly, it isn&#x27;t greasy, and doesn&#x27;t have an overpowering scent.</li>
            <li> Lotion has a light scent that gets lighter as you wear it. The effect of the lotion on your skin is noticeable right away. Such a great product and a great price, too.</li>
            <li> i am using it as one of the moisturisers.. has pleasant smell... my husband uses it too... not too thick and so i love it.. blends well into skin</li>
            <li> I found this at a nail salon.  In the winter it makes my hands very smooth.  I love the smell of the lotion and fell in love right away so I went a bought this big bottle.  I love it!</li>
            <li> This is an ordinary lotion at best. It has a more oily texture than usual, which takes time to absorb and isn&#x27;t too comfortable on the skin. It has an evident perfume scent but there&#x27;s nothing listed in the ingredients that suggests what might be emitting this scent... which makes me suspect that the whole label is totally a marketing hoax: no mention of a manufacturer, an address, or even a country of origin, it&#x27;s full of typos and looks like a typical knock-off coming from China. I went and read some of the reviews and many seem to be identical (look for the &amp;#34;Five Stars&amp;#34; titles) and I suspect were crowd sourced. Charging nearly $12 for a 750 ml bottle is outrageous---Amazon was kind enough to refund some of it. Look elsewhere.</li>
            <li> This lotion is great! I used at the nail place that I go to and loved it so much... they charge more than amazon so I figure I would buy it here.  Love you!</li>
            <li> Love this lotion.  After trying several different all natural lotions that did nothing for my dry winter skin I purchased this after going for a mani and pedi.  It is far from all natural but it works!!!  You can put it on your face too.  T</li>
            <li> Rub all over, cover yourself in chopped romaine. Add garbanzo beans and feta. Buona notte.</li>
            <li> the entire family loves it.i would reccommend this to everyone for has dry skin it works fast and is not greasy like most other products...</li>
            <li> Never peel after the beach. Very soft skin  Love this product  Would definitely recommend this moisturizer  I give it as gifts so everyone can experience great results</li>
            <li> This is the only lotion I have found that helps my so dry,winter cracked, painful hands. It smells great and feels wonderful on. I just love it!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love it leaves your skin feeling smooth  and regenerated</li>
            <li> AS I STATED ABOUT THE PURPLE LABEL, THIS WAS IS SCENTED, W LEMONGRASS! I HAVE BEEN USING IT FOR 5 YEARS NOW, ITS A GREAT BODY, HAND, NECK CREAM. THERE ARE 4-5 INGREDIANTS, NO CHEMICALS, THE UNSCENTED IS PERFECT FOR YOUR HUBBY WHILE YOU USE THIS!</li>
            <li> I love it. It is the best lotion that I have used.</li>
            <li> My hands are always rough, since I have been using this they are once again soft...  Love it !</li>
            <li> Was used at the salon I went &amp; just had to order it! Leaves your hands super soft &amp; has a pleasant smell!</li>
            <li> I I have suffered with KP for most of my teen and adult life and have tried everything to get rid of it .I was at the point of really just giving up and living with the redness , bumps and trying not to constantly pick at the keratin plugs that build up around each hair follicle!,  The best I&#x27;ve achieved is to smooth my skin  temporarily and  slightly, but still have always had the appearance of redness and spots all over the backs of my arms and my legs. It&#x27;s been so bad that people have asked  me how I got such an awful rash.:(&lt;br /&gt;  It&#x27;s embarrassing and frustrating.&lt;br /&gt; One of my coworkers had a tube of dream dream lotion on his desk, I used it on my hands as they get really dry in the winter. I had applied too much so I used the excess on my arms. Two days later I  happened to notice a big improvement in the smoothness of my arms.  When I saw how well one casual application&lt;br /&gt;Of this Dream Dream lotion worked I immediately went online to Amazon and ordered&lt;br /&gt;A 750ml size bottle as well as a tube of it to carry with me. I read the reviews and saw other people saying it helped their KP as well.&lt;br /&gt;  I have  been using this product on my arms and legs  for no more than 2 weeks and yes it is a miracle!!!&lt;br /&gt;  At first I noticed my skin feeling smooth&lt;br /&gt;And within a week saw the red spots DISAPPEARING. !!!!  I couldn&#x27;t believe my eyes&lt;br /&gt;And kept staring into the mirror , it seemed to good to be true . I have found that I don&#x27;t have to use the lotion everyday to keep my skin nice although I will see a tiny bit of redness come back if I skip a few days , but even then my skin stays soft . Over all it seems to have a cumulative effect. I wish I could give this product&lt;br /&gt;10 stars!!! It&#x27;s  very concentrated so little goes a long way, the price is very cheap.&lt;br /&gt;  I&#x27;m curious to know what ingredient is responsible for this amazing transformation to my skin, I&#x27;m thinking its the olive oil but that&#x27;s just my best guess .&lt;br /&gt;  If you have suffered with KP please give this product a try , buy the big bottle as I know you will love it. As I said, nothing has ever worked for my KP until now . I really hope they continue to manufacture this lotion for a long time!!!!!</li>
            <li> I have used almost every product on the market for my dry sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;This by far the best I have ever used. My hands and legs are looking and feeling&lt;br /&gt;remarkably soft and soothed, and YOUNGER! Yay!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Smells terrible plus gave me a really bad allergy all over my body!</li>
            <li> This lotion is silky, smells great, and moisturizes wonderfully. I was given the first bottle as a gift and had to search the internet for another when I ran out.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion but the pump was broken during shipment.  I highly suggest the pump ship separately with the product.  Had to return.</li>
            <li> This is the best!  I&#x27;ve tried other creams but this is truly the best; the pump bottle makes it so easy to use.</li>
            <li> I just love this lotion. It leaves your skin well hydrated and smelling amazing.</li>
            <li> Love this lotion.  Wonderful scent and luscious lotion on skin.</li>
