            <li>This pair has one good quality, sharpness.  </li>
            <li>i have been very pleased with these scissors...</li>
            <li>I LOVE THESE SHEARS!  </li>
            <li>I cut my own bangs and split ends and</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay, doesn&#x27;t look like how the picture describes</li>
            <li>I would spend more for sharper, better quality shears.</li>
            <li>The shears work fine, but they were not the ones in the picture....not made my Revlon.  </li>
            <li>so happy finally I found the right shears..</li>
            <li>but I still need something more professional.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think they are of the quality of my old ones that I&#x27;ve had for many years.</li>
            <li>I misplaced my good barber shears and read numerous reviews wanting to find a low cost, but good shears as a replacement.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;1)  can only use for light trimming, can&#x27;t cut through sections of hair like for a straight line trim at bottom of hair, blades deflect and don&#x27;t cut (had to use my Fiskar desk scissors for that)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>also give a much cleaner cut.&lt;br</li>
            <li>&amp; I think you will be very pleased.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Not sharp and smooth enough.</li>
            <li>They wouldn&#x27;t even cut a single thread clean cut.</li>
            <li>; to be excact easy to use very sharp,I know these shears will last me a long time..</li>
            <li>Sharp and comfortable.</li>
            <li>The new shears work.  </li>
            <li>they remain sharp and are fun to use.i would absolutely recomend these scissors</li>
            <li>THEY CUT HAIR PRECISELY AND ARE VERY SHARP.  </li>
            <li>not for professional or home use.</li>
            <li>everytime you use it and have to be fixed only to have them come off again.</li>
            <li>For me the shears are okay, but for my husband the scissors handle (where you put your fingers through) is a little to narrow, even though his hands are neither big or fat.</li>
            <li>stainless steel makes cutting hair home easy.</li>

            <li> they drag and stick, and are not sharp at all.  </li>
            <li> and I just have a feeling that these aren&#x27;t sharp enough and dull quickly.</li>
            <li> They are ok to use for cutting, but as you get close to the end, they stop and you have to adjust.  </li>

            <li> I wanted a precision shear that is extremely sharp all the way through the point.  </li>

            <li> the only bad thing is the red finger grips (that are in the handle)</li>

            <li> they drag and stick, and are not sharp at all.  they make haircut look like you did it with weed eater.  not for professional or home use.</li>
            <li> Best Shears for Hair trimming</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay, doesn&#x27;t look like how the picture describes but hey it works for it&#x27;s purpose and that&#x27;s all I need.</li>
            <li> This is the third pair of these Revlon shears I have purchased . Each pair was slightly different but mostly similar. This pair is the poorest quality. I would not recommend these shears.</li>
            <li> These scissors weren&#x27;t worth a crap! DULL,DULL,DULL!!! They wouldn&#x27;t even cut a single thread clean cut. This is no exaggeration. When sewing the table cloth for my grandson&#x27;s birthday, I grabbed the shears to cut a single thread and it wouldn&#x27;t even cut. I will never buy these again.</li>
            <li> I wanted a precision shear that is extremely sharp all the way through the point.  These did not fit my requirements.  They are ok to use for cutting, but as you get close to the end, they stop and you have to adjust.  I&#x27;ll keep them but I still need something more professional.</li>
            <li> Scissors that were mailed to me were were not made by Revlon and they did not look as advertised. They were made by Sally.</li>
            <li> The new shears work.  I don&#x27;t think they are of the quality of my old ones that I&#x27;ve had for many years.</li>
            <li> Wife is happy. I&#x27;m happy.</li>
            <li> Good product for the price</li>
            <li> I misplaced my good barber shears and read numerous reviews wanting to find a low cost, but good shears as a replacement.  This pair has one good quality, sharpness.  Here are the not so good:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1)  can only use for light trimming, can&#x27;t cut through sections of hair like for a straight line trim at bottom of hair, blades deflect and don&#x27;t cut (had to use my Fiskar desk scissors for that)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2)  the rubber finger cushions are not glued in place and come out repeatedly and easily while cutting with the shears&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My experience indicates that I should shop at local beauty supply stores where I can inspect before buying.</li>
            <li> Sharp and comfortable.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THESE SHEARS!  THE BEST PAIR I&#x27;VE EVER OWNED.  THEY CUT HAIR PRECISELY AND ARE VERY SHARP.  GREAT PRODUCT!</li>
            <li> Not sharp and smooth enough.</li>
            <li> Scissors that were mailed to me were were made by Revlon and they did not look as advertised (no red on the handles, and they were longer than I wanted.</li>
            <li> The shears work fine, but they were not the ones in the picture....not made my Revlon.  It was false advertising</li>
            <li> i have been very pleased with these scissors...they remain sharp and are fun to use.i would absolutely recomend these scissors</li>
            <li> I would spend more for sharper, better quality shears. The rubber in the handle keeps popping out and I just have a feeling that these aren&#x27;t sharp enough and dull quickly. You get what you pay for, but I am just snipping split ends here and there.</li>
            <li> so happy finally I found the right shears..7&amp;#34; to be excact easy to use very sharp,I know these shears will last me a long time..I cut my own bangs and split ends and my loong hair looks great!! I do recommend it to those who likes to cut or trim their own hair!</li>
            <li> I bought this barber shears for me and my husband. We cut each others hair once a month. For me the shears are okay, but for my husband the scissors handle (where you put your fingers through) is a little to narrow, even though his hands are neither big or fat. Otherwise it does the job good.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend these shears for women&#x27;s hands only.</li>
            <li> Stays sharp for a long time. stainless steel makes cutting hair home easy. fits the womens hand well</li>
            <li> I bought several pair of barber shears recently, &amp; these stand above the rest.&lt;br /&gt;You can feel the difference of the made in usa precision ground blades.&lt;br /&gt;They also give a much cleaner cut.&lt;br /&gt;Lifetime warranty to boot. Cut nothing but hair with these &amp; I think you will be very pleased.&lt;br /&gt;Looks like the made in China pair will go into the dog grooming kit, And the Revlons will&lt;br /&gt;be cutting my hair. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> They work great the only bad thing is the red finger grips (that are in the handle) they come off everytime you use it and have to be fixed only to have them come off again.</li>
