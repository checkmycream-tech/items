            <li>My skin feels like a baby :) .</li>

            <li>works great with super dry winter skin.</li>
            <li>It has a nice scent and has not affected my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>and I am soooo lucky that a sales lady recommended this overnight mask.  </li>
            <li>Amazon should have the same price at least...is there more than one for this price, I do not seem to be able to find out</li>
            <li>I have normal skin leaning toward the oily side, but I still love this.</li>
            <li>I do this daily and my skin looks amazing</li>
            <li>Origins strikes once again with another amazing product!&lt;br /&gt;I am a male in his 20&#x27;s</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pricy but worth it.</li>
            <li>At night, I my face, beck and chest with warm water and a washcloth, followed by a think layer of this product (extra around my eyes).</li>
            <li>I was looking for a moisturizing overnight mask that would allow me to wake up with my face moisturized and fresh.</li>
            <li>I happen to like the fruity smell (kind of apricot-y), and it&#x27;s not super strong, but I can see how some might be bothered by it.</li>
            <li>My regular moisturizer is better.</li>
            <li>They make my skin feel soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my first purchase</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s probably not worth the price when it comes to performance alone, but the feel and smell of the product make it very likable.</li>
            <li>I got two large blood blisters on my nose.</li>
            <li>I would not want to live without this product again and always make sure that I  have extra supply on hand.</li>
            <li>I really let this stuff soak in</li>
            <li>This mask works my face is as smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom the next morning</li>
            <li>When i put it on my skin instantly feels smooth and moisturized.</li>
            <li>and it really helps</li>
            <li>but I really needed to put my two cents.</li>
            <li>Very soothing, and got rid of the dry/tight feeling.  </li>
            <li>I really like this overnight mask.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s still more moisturizing than some other products I&#x27;ve used, but I don&#x27;t plan to buy this again.</li>
            <li>I honestly wouldn&#x27;t waste the money on this one, Boots has a nice moisturizing mask that works just as well if not better, and it&#x27;s not overnight.</li>
            <li>and I am fine all day long without having to do additional moisturizing.</li>
            <li>Love this, I have dry, wrinkled skin and have used this mask everyday as a moisturizer and My wrinkled skin is looking a lot better since I started using this moidturizer.</li>
            <li>I was really excited to finally order this product after seeing some youtubers using the origins brand and this product in particular.</li>
            <li>, I think it is available to my dry skin.</li>
            <li>Also, my sensitive skin tends to be very picky</li>
            <li>I have definitely tried other products that work better.</li>
            <li>I felt completely parched from the inside out</li>
            <li>and of course, I like the all natural ingredients.  </li>
            <li>and my skin finally  feels normal again.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m not sure if my reaction is due to my own intolerance or the product itself.</li>
            <li>The next day my skin felt like new born</li>
            <li>It makes a real difference in my dry skin.</li>
            <li>My skin doesn&#x27;t feel oily or greasy the next day, just very soft.  </li>
            <li>but if you know Origins, you know that they only use natural ingredients</li>
            <li>I am in my mid 50&#x27;s and hormonal changes have made my skin super dry, especially around the upper check and the chin and upper lip areas.</li>
            <li>I agree with some other reviews, it really Dosent make my skin feel amazingly soft the next day.</li>
            <li>My skin would feel moisturized when I woke up, but even so much as splashing my face with a little water and the effects were GONE.</li>

            <li> and this helps a lot, especially during the dry, winter months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use this on the nights before bed that I see I am drying out bc of the weather, or from other products and it totally refreshes my skin.</li>
            <li> In the winter my skin tends to dry out.</li>
            <li> i didn&#x27;t have a problem with this being an overnight mask, because it would dry in about 10 minutes, so then it doesn&#x27;t get all over my pillowcase</li>
            <li> It will not help me &amp; my dry skin get through Chicago winters</li>
            <li> and I have dry skin living in Phoenix as</li>
            <li> I wash my face thoroughly, pat dry it, apply moisturizer serum,let that dry and then apply this overnight mask...</li>
            <li> have a combination of oily and dry skin and the winter tends to bring out the dry side</li>
            <li> No dryness,  I have eczema itchy dry burning skins.</li>
            <li> I have really, really dry skin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m kind of disappointed in that sense.</li>
            <li> My skin was starting to feel dry and tight after using an enzyme mask.</li>
            <li> If you tend to be very dry...</li>
            <li> Twice now it has given me extremely puffy skin (especially around my eyes) and made me slightly itchy.  </li>
            <li> SO I BECAME CURIOUS AND DECIDED TO CHECK OUT THE COMPANY ORIGINS AND SEE IF THEY HAD A ONLINE ORDER DEPT..</li>
            <li> but I am not aware of any allergies that I would have to any of the ingredients</li>
            <li> you won&#x27;t be disappointed &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> cleared up some seriously dry patch of skin on my face!!!</li>
            <li> I used it for only two times and it caused serious allergy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thick, but it&#x27;s not nearly as greasy as some YouTube reviews have suggested.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it was not moisturizing enough for my dry skin.</li>
            <li> I noticed that reviewers said they use this as their everyday moisturizer.</li>
            <li> In the morning, I mix a small amount with my concealer to even out my skin tone.</li>
            <li> Probably wouldn&#x27;t buy again :/</li>
            <li> I have used this product for at least 10 years.  </li>
            <li> it did not break me out even though it was really thick.</li>
            <li> BUT THE PRICE SEEM A BIT EXPENSIVE ON AMAZON FOR 3.4 OZ..</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> and my skin made me feel miserable all day long and even wake me at night.&lt;br</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s sticky and greasy, it&#x27;s very uncomfortable to sleep having this mask on your face.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t disappointed it exceeded my expectations</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Unfortunately it was not moisturizing enough for my dry skin. My regular moisturizer is better.</li>
            <li> They make my skin feel soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> I leave this on all night, does the job</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okey, but I don&#x27;t quite understand how to use it overnight: it&#x27;s sticky and greasy, it&#x27;s very uncomfortable to sleep having this mask on your face. But it does the job.</li>
            <li> I am in my mid 50&#x27;s and hormonal changes have made my skin super dry, especially around the upper check and the chin and upper lip areas. I suffered for several years and had tried dozens of different products and even though I would apply moisturizers all through the day, I still felt like I wanted to rip the skin off my face.  I felt completely parched from the inside out and my skin made me feel miserable all day long and even wake me at night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was in extra misery on a trip to low  humidity Nevada  and I am soooo lucky that a sales lady recommended this overnight mask.  She had not used it herself, but said her boyfriend loved this product. On that first evening I applied the mask over and over until my skin felt better and then went to sleep. The next day my skin felt like new born and I couldn&#x27;t believe the difference!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used this same routine EVERY night since March 2011 and my skin finally  feels normal again. I really let this stuff soak in and I can now apply moisturizer in the morning and I am fine all day long without having to do additional moisturizing. The instructions say to use this product 2 or 3 times a week, but I need it it every night.  I would not want to live without this product again and always make sure that I  have extra supply on hand. This mask has been a life saver for me!</li>
            <li> Origins has a great array of products. In the winter my skin tends to dry out. I can wear this nightly and it leaves my skin feeling great. It has a nice scent and has not affected my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> cleared up some seriously dry patch of skin on my face!!!</li>
            <li> perfect mask - the skin becomes bright again</li>
            <li> love this overnight mask. works great with super dry winter skin. it did not break me out even though it was really thick. i didn&#x27;t have a problem with this being an overnight mask, because it would dry in about 10 minutes, so then it doesn&#x27;t get all over my pillowcase</li>
            <li> Love it and use it all the time.</li>
            <li> I noticed that reviewers said they use this as their everyday moisturizer. This is definitely not moisturizing enough to use every day.  I&#x27;m kind of disappointed in that sense. It&#x27;s still more moisturizing than some other products I&#x27;ve used, but I don&#x27;t plan to buy this again. It will not help me &amp; my dry skin get through Chicago winters so I&#x27;ll have to continue searching for something else.</li>
            <li> This is a nice product in that it smells nice. However, I didn&#x27;t notice a change in my skin. My skin would feel moisturized when I woke up, but even so much as splashing my face with a little water and the effects were GONE. I honestly wouldn&#x27;t waste the money on this one, Boots has a nice moisturizing mask that works just as well if not better, and it&#x27;s not overnight.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for at least 10 years.  I never want to run out of it.  It does what it says it will do</li>
            <li> Macy&#x27;s has it for $24.00.... I am not getting it. Amazon should have the same price at least...is there more than one for this price, I do not seem to be able to find out</li>
            <li> I used this product daily. It&#x27;s pricy but worth it. At night, I my face, beck and chest with warm water and a washcloth, followed by a think layer of this product (extra around my eyes). In the morning, I mix a small amount with my concealer to even out my skin tone.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good, waiting to finish my first month with it!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really tell if my skin is that much more moisturized from using it, but it does have a fantastic smell and feel. It doesn&#x27;t go on greasy and the ingredients are amazing so Hopefully they&#x27;re doing what they&#x27;re supposed to!</li>
            <li> This mask works my face is as smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom the next morning and I have dry skin living in Phoenix as</li>
            <li> This is a tricky review.  At first I loved this mask, but I think I may be allergic to something in this or it is just upsetting my skin.  Twice now it has given me extremely puffy skin (especially around my eyes) and made me slightly itchy.  It&#x27;s probably an allergic reaction to something in it but I am not aware of any allergies that I would have to any of the ingredients so I&#x27;m not sure if my reaction is due to my own intolerance or the product itself.</li>
            <li> I WANTED TO TRY THIS PRODUCT..BUT THE PRICE SEEM A BIT EXPENSIVE ON AMAZON FOR 3.4 OZ..SO I BECAME CURIOUS AND DECIDED TO CHECK OUT THE COMPANY ORIGINS AND SEE IF THEY HAD A ONLINE ORDER DEPT..AND COMPARED THE PRICE...BINGO...TO MY SURPRISE THEY HAD IT THE 3.4 OZ PRODUCT FOR 24.00 DOLLARS...SO I GUESS YOU KNOW WHAT I DID...JUST SAYING....</li>
            <li> I absolutely love, love this product. My skin is supple and smooth. I wash my face thoroughly, pat dry it, apply moisturizer serum,let that dry and then apply this overnight mask...I do this daily and my skin looks amazing, I get compliments that I look radiant! It&#x27;s my first purchase, it was recommended to me, I will definitely buy it again and again.</li>
            <li> Love the scent of this - and the results!</li>
            <li> I was really excited to finally order this product after seeing some youtubers using the origins brand and this product in particular. I have to say, it have the most amazing orange/mango smell, I love putting it on. When i put it on my skin instantly feels smooth and moisturized. I agree with some other reviews, it really Dosent make my skin feel amazingly soft the next day. I have definitely tried other products that work better. Tip: use a toner that will prepare your skin to absorb the product better! I feel like this helps. Probably wouldn&#x27;t buy again :/</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not going to say it works miracles, but this stuff smells so good and does leave skin soft.  I&#x27;ve started using it on my face and hands just because I love the fragrance, and of course, I like the all natural ingredients.  It&#x27;s probably not worth the price when it comes to performance alone, but the feel and smell of the product make it very likable.</li>
            <li> Origins strikes once again with another amazing product!&lt;br /&gt;I am a male in his 20&#x27;s so I wasn&#x27;t the target audience for this product but MAN does it do wonders.&lt;br /&gt;I have a combination of oily and dry skin and the winter tends to bring out the dry side so I thought I&#x27;d try this out.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been very satisfied with how well this hydrates my skin overnight without leaving a greasy/oily feeling.  Also, my sensitive skin tends to be very picky but if you know Origins, you know that they only use natural ingredients so my face loved it!&lt;br /&gt;Just buy it already! you won&#x27;t be disappointed &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> It makes a real difference in my dry skin. I use it both day and night and it really helps</li>
            <li> I used it for only two times and it caused serious allergy. I got two large blood blisters on my nose.</li>
            <li> I like this masque, I think it is available to my dry skin. I do not advise the oil skin buy it.</li>
            <li> Love this, I have dry, wrinkled skin and have used this mask everyday as a moisturizer and My wrinkled skin is looking a lot better since I started using this moidturizer.</li>
            <li> This product is simply amazing! ! I bought it at Macys not on Amazon but I really needed to put my two cents. My skin feels like a baby :) . No dryness,  I have eczema itchy dry burning skins. I wasn&#x27;t disappointed it exceeded my expectations</li>
            <li> I have normal skin leaning toward the oily side, but I still love this. My skin was starting to feel dry and tight after using an enzyme mask. I got this to use afterwards, and it has been wonderful. Very soothing, and got rid of the dry/tight feeling.  My skin doesn&#x27;t feel oily or greasy the next day, just very soft.  I happen to like the fruity smell (kind of apricot-y), and it&#x27;s not super strong, but I can see how some might be bothered by it.</li>
            <li> I really like this overnight mask. I was looking for a moisturizing overnight mask that would allow me to wake up with my face moisturized and fresh. This did the trick! I have really, really dry skin and this helps a lot, especially during the dry, winter months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also has a great smell!</li>
            <li> If you tend to be very dry... BUY THIS! I use this on the nights before bed that I see I am drying out bc of the weather, or from other products and it totally refreshes my skin. It&#x27;s thick, but it&#x27;s not nearly as greasy as some YouTube reviews have suggested. Can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
