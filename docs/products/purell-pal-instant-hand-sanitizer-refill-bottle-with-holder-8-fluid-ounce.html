            <li>The kids love it, too.</li>
            <li>I love this perell holder I seen one at the hospital when my daughter delivered my grand baby</li>
            <li>Im glad I was able to purchase it</li>
            <li>But they serve a much more important purpose.</li>
            <li>i.m a clean freak and wash my hand all the time and love the smell of purell</li>

            <li>A great and fun reminder to keep your hands germ free as much as possible.</li>
            <li>love it  thanks!</li>
            <li>They asked where I got it and thought it was cool and fun.</li>
            <li>I will definitely get more of these!</li>
            <li>It be nice if they were made in different colors.</li>
            <li>&quot; This is the real thing!</li>
            <li>i love it and use it daily.</li>
            <li>The bottle really stays in place!</li>
            <li>very cute little gel holder.  </li>
            <li>What can I say, it&#x27;s durable, it pretty much fits in anywhere</li>
            <li>Seems like you&#x27;re paying a little more for the cool looking holder.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>The nice sturdy little &amp;#34;person&amp;#34; holds it sturdily.</li>
            <li>They really hold the bottle steady while you pump!</li>
            <li>She loves it so much that now she has one at school &amp; home!&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>you so much.  </li>
            <li>I ordered this for my boss who really likes Purell.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s darling and gets more use than the other bottles.</li>
            <li>So many times, especially as the bottle began to run low, we&#x27;d pump it, and the bottle would slip out from underneath and go flying.</li>
            <li>They love this little guy and he&#x27;s quite durable.</li>
            <li>Instead we love it because we can walk buy, use one hand to pump a little out</li>
            <li>Comes with a cool blue bottle guy to hold your purell, and mostly fits other similar size soap bottles.</li>
            <li>Simple enough to use, easy to remember to use because of the stand.</li>
            <li>I bought this last year in an effort to keep first graders from accidentally knocking the hand sanitizer bottle into the trash can.</li>
            <li>This stand is terrific for anyone who uses a large container of hand-sanitizer.  </li>
            <li>I keep my hand sanitizer pal on my desk and use it frequently when grading papers.</li>
            <li>He can hold some other brands, but only the Purell refills really fit well.</li>
            <li>Not only is it great to have a sanitizer around, it&#x27;s a cute addtion to a sometimes boring office.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a fun little office Purell holder.</li>
            <li>little \\&quot;Pal\\&quot;, gives little hands an incentive to keep germ free.</li>

            <li> He&#x27;s firmly held at least 8 refills since then.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just a plus to have this bottle holder, I mean not many brands will give you a bottle holder.</li>
            <li> - Purell name brand hand sanitizer, can&#x27;t go wrong with it.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> and if you&#x27;re really desperate, you can drink it too.....</li>

            <li> Simple enough to use, easy to remember to use because of the stand. It looks liek a set of hands. The bottle almost gives the stand a body and it has feet too. I liek it!&lt;br /&gt;Might be good for kids so that they remember to wosh their hands or use the sanitizer while at a picnic.</li>
            <li> After ordering this purell pal, I almost canceled the order, since the item title says \\&quot;refill bottle.\\&quot; This is the real thing! It comes withe adorable guy and a bottle of sanitizer. Great product!</li>
            <li> This is too cute!  It&#x27;s on my desk at work and everyone loves it.</li>
            <li> Perfect for my desk at work.  I also have one in my kitchen at home.  A great and fun reminder to keep your hands germ free as much as possible.</li>
            <li> Excellent transaction.....Just adorable....Saw it in my doctors office and said, &amp;#34;I have to get a few of them to put around the house! love it  thanks!</li>
            <li> Comes in handy. Good conversation piece.</li>
            <li> cleans your hands faster than soap and water can......and if you&#x27;re really desperate, you can drink it too.....just kidding, but i&#x27;ve seen people do it</li>
            <li> Comes with a cool blue bottle guy to hold your purell, and mostly fits other similar size soap bottles. It&#x27;s just a plus to have this bottle holder, I mean not many brands will give you a bottle holder.</li>
            <li> This is the best Pal a first grader could have! I purchased this with subscribe &amp; save monthly for my granddaughter for her class requirement  of a hand sanitizer. She loves it so much that now she has one at school &amp; home!&lt;br /&gt;This little \\&quot;Pal\\&quot;, gives little hands an incentive to keep germ free.</li>
            <li> I was this item at a Chrysler Dealer when we went to buy our van &amp; the staff had it on their desks. I asked where they got them&lt;br /&gt;because as a nurse I wanted one for me &amp; would make ideal gifts. The person I spoke with had no idea where or who&lt;br /&gt;bought them for the Chrysler staff so again I went to Amazon &amp; you came thru. my items came just in time for Christmas.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you so much.  Oh the price was grt as well.</li>
            <li> Product was shipped on time. I am enjoying it, especially the chrome base. I can&#x27;t wait to get the next bottle.</li>
            <li> Great I will oder more soon.</li>
            <li> i love it and use it daily. i.m a clean freak and wash my hand all the time and love the smell of purell</li>
            <li> I keep my hand sanitizer pal on my desk and use it frequently when grading papers. My students like it because it is so cute and as a result they are using the hand sanitizer more often. I plan to order a second one for the students to use so I can keep this one all to myself!</li>
            <li> very cute little gel holder.  Works great.  Easy access to Purell hand sanitizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Small enough for the counter.  Big enough that my cat can&#x27;t knock it over!</li>
            <li> I bought this last year in an effort to keep first graders from accidentally knocking the hand sanitizer bottle into the trash can. It totally worked! They love this little guy and he&#x27;s quite durable. He&#x27;s firmly held at least 8 refills since then. He can hold some other brands, but only the Purell refills really fit well.</li>
            <li> As many of us these days keep sanitizer on our desks at work....this is  a great, fun way to have it out there. I get quite a few compliments on it.</li>
            <li> Yes it&#x27;s cute and it works. it has arms and legs as all hand sanitizer should. I keep it in my massage office.</li>
            <li> - Purell name brand hand sanitizer, can&#x27;t go wrong with it.&lt;br /&gt;- Seems like you&#x27;re paying a little more for the cool looking holder.&lt;br /&gt;- Buying in bulk would make sense once you buy this setup ONCE!</li>
            <li> Got sepsis on mothers day and was in hospital for 12 days and transition home for 19 and when I got home I bought&lt;br /&gt;purell and then I bought the little guy holder and a few for my friends use it all the time now.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my office and I love it. Not only is it great to have a sanitizer around, it&#x27;s a cute addtion to a sometimes boring office. Everyone gets a kick out of it.</li>
            <li> I was ordering Purell and got these because I thought that they were cute. But they serve a much more important purpose. They really hold the bottle steady while you pump! So many times, especially as the bottle began to run low, we&#x27;d pump it, and the bottle would slip out from underneath and go flying. This prevents that from happening! It has a stand in back of the feet as well, and that&#x27;s why this works so well. The bottle really stays in place! And you just replace the bottle with another 8-ounce Purell (with pump) when this one is empty or refill the one it comes with. GREAT Product! I will definitely get more of these!</li>
            <li> This is the neatest! It doesn&#x27;t topple over like they sometimes do. The nice sturdy little &amp;#34;person&amp;#34; holds it sturdily. The kids love it, too. And, oh, yes, Purell can&#x27;t be beat. This one has moisturizers and vitamin E.</li>
            <li> I ordered this thinking our granddaughter would like the hands and feet.  Instead we love it because we can walk buy, use one hand to pump a little out and it doesn&#x27;t tip over.  My husband thought I was nuts for ordering it but after trying it told me to get another one!</li>
            <li> What can I say, it&#x27;s durable, it pretty much fits in anywhere and it&#x27;s reusable.  Great product, looks as advertised.</li>
            <li> This stand is terrific for anyone who uses a large container of hand-sanitizer.  Absolutely adorable and is a fun edition to any home or classroom &#x3D;-)!</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my boss who really likes Purell. I put this at the conference table where he sits and it&#x27;s darling and gets more use than the other bottles. It&#x27;s a fun little office Purell holder. This is probably great for kids too.</li>
            <li> Several friends have commented about the Purell holder. They asked where I got it and thought it was cool and fun.</li>
            <li> I really liked this hand sanitizer holder, it&#x27;s a nice display. It be nice if they were made in different colors. Good quality!</li>
            <li> I love this perell holder I seen one at the hospital when my daughter delivered my grand baby Im glad I was able to purchase it</li>
