            <li>An electric toothbrush with a circular head, keeps a good charge, easy to maintain, and at a good price.</li>
            <li>Consumers Reports Magazine rated the Oral B smart series (3000 and 5000) as the best electric brushes based on evaluation of users by dentists (using plaque revealing dies).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Amazing.</li>
            <li>Light weight, durable, great to travel with, rapid charging.</li>
            <li>I had it for over a year and it works amazingly.</li>
            <li>IT is amazing difference for us that I got another one.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Awesome charge hold, Amazing effectiveness, but</li>
            <li>results are amazing</li>
            <li>Amazing product!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Fantastic price and does a great job.  </li>
            <li>The amazing folks at Oral-B allowed their app to work using the microphone.  </li>
            <li>This is fantastic and great.  </li>
            <li>My teeth feel amazing when done.</li>
            <li>Great Price and free shipping to boot.</li>
            <li>My mouth feels amazing after every brushing.</li>
            <li>It  would be nice to have something that will hold a longer charge.  </li>
            <li>My son, who has braces, uses this toothbrush and it is effective in cleaning his teeth.</li>
            <li>The website asks for proof of purchase and we have to pay our own postage to return it.</li>
            <li>Nice rubberized grip&lt;br</li>
            <li>It looks nice.</li>
            <li>This is a really nice brush.  </li>
            <li>This is a really nice mechanical brush.</li>
            <li>I am very happy that it arrived very promptly after I placed my order.</li>
            <li>It kind of tickled and didn&#x27;t feel like it was doing the job, whether it was or not, leading to me just not using it correctly.  </li>
            <li>the toothbrush is effective, but the metal pole is rusting</li>
            <li>Works well and really does and excellent job.</li>
            <li>I own 2 Oral B Pro Care toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li>liked that it buzzes every 30 seconds to let you know to move on to another part, and I like that</li>
            <li>Works very well and offered at an excellent price.</li>
            <li>This was a temporary condition that resolved on its own once I discontinued its use per the dentist&#x27;s order.</li>
            <li>We own two units because my kids have their own bathroom.</li>
            <li>She also using a flossing head and finds it highly effective.  </li>
            <li>fast service, great product at a great price.</li>
            <li>The timer is nice.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not stuck with the kind that came with it.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how it got so many good reviews honestly.</li>
            <li>Nice</li>
            <li>not his own, for the foundation of this book.</li>
            <li>after two minutes it gives you a nice notification.</li>
            <li>excellent product, fast shipping</li>
            <li>THIS IS THE ABSOLUTE BEST BRUSH IV USED.  </li>
            <li>this came with some sort of clamp, or maybe a person to hold the brush for you, then it would be a nice massage tool for people.</li>
            <li>that has been popular for years.  </li>
            <li>The charge indicator lights are nice, as is the quadrant notification feature.</li>
            <li>i have to say it is kind of an ordeal to use this thing.</li>
            <li>But I I&#x27;m very happy with it,  if you charge it for the whole night</li>
            <li>Holds charge for a week and really effective.</li>
            <li>she&#x27;s loving it.</li>
            <li>The starter toothbrush has a 2 minute timer which kind of leaves</li>
            <li>is nice and sleek.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s a nice tooth brush.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m loving the Oral-B 1000.</li>
            <li>She was thrilled.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It cleans well and the brushes seem to hold up nicely.  </li>
            <li>Save your teeth while they are still good. :)</li>
            <li>Nice toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>My dentist agrees that this toothbrush is effective in cleaning my teeth and reducing the amount of plaque.</li>
            <li>This honestly might work as a nightlight in a bathroom if you wanted it too -</li>
            <li>Honestly I don&#x27;t think anyone needs timers, a stand, self-cleaning feature, and a pressure sensor for brushing teeth.</li>
            <li>i got this for my husband after he saw how much i liked my own.  </li>
            <li>I would have liked a carrying case, but none is included.</li>
            <li>To each their own, I suppose.</li>
            <li>Each time I go to the dentist they compliment me on how nice my teeth and gums look.</li>
            <li>I own both a Sonicare and an Oral-B</li>
            <li>Since I still had a couple of Oral-B brush tips and because I liked the brand, I decided to stay with Oral-</li>
            <li>Nice, since I brush for way longer than 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too noisy, doesn&#x27;t take much space in the bathroom, has a great grip ... 5 stars!</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, it&#x27;s the thorough and effective cleaning that this model provides.</li>
            <li>and the timer is nice.</li>
            <li>I read a LOT of reviews on electric toothbrushes before going with the Oral B Pro Care 1000 and I am thrilled with my purchase.  </li>
            <li>Does a nice job, but a bit noisy</li>
            <li>Nicely packaged.  </li>
            <li>It took quite a while, more than 12 hours for the battery to fully charge and takes a good while for it to fully recharge to capacity after each use.</li>
            <li>It is as good or better than her</li>
            <li>Nice package.</li>
            <li>and I each have our own heads and share the handle).&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
            <li>both my kids were thrilled to receive these.</li>
            <li>She liked it from day one</li>
            <li>Fast shipping, great price!</li>
            <li>and I am thrilled with it.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Let&#x27;s be honest: it&#x27;s a toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>I already own one of these and purchased another to have at my dad&#x27;s place (out of state) while visiting him there.  </li>
            <li>Others may find it really handy.  </li>
            <li>My Dental Hygienist really liked the results of using this toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Interchangeable heads are nice.</li>
            <li>With the help of Oral B and some good mouthrinses, my gums are getting so healthy.</li>
            <li>As a dentist I wanted an electric toothbrush that was effective.  </li>
            <li>Excellent price on a much recommended product.  </li>
            <li>I thought my old one was good, but this one is the best.</li>
            <li>I have had an Oral B electric toothbrush for many years and have loved it.  </li>
            <li>Kind of a pain.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It keeps you honest.  </li>
            <li>Each family member would probably require their own unit.</li>
            <li>this is safe and effective in cleaning teeth and making the mouth feel good.</li>
            <li>product came with a plastic travel case, which I may use infrequently, but it&#x27;s nice to have something to protect it.</li>
            <li>The handle is nice and has a nice feel and</li>
            <li>i kind of think it&#x27;s too forceful now though.</li>
            <li>It does a good job on our teeth, and we are both pleased.</li>
            <li>Very easy, very effective and makes brushing easy.</li>
            <li>Awesome fast deliver and at a great price too, packed well and easy to open, works great and about 50% off the price when I ordered :) Happy customer!!</li>
            <li>This model 1000 was a great replacement for our original.  </li>
            <li>Great price, nice design, decent battery life and very nice</li>
            <li>Its really worth a try !!!</li>
            <li>well worth it!!!</li>
            <li>My teeth are very clean now and in a week my teeth have become whiter, and it&#x27;s very easy to clean in between my braces!!!</li>
            <li>I like it very much and it works very good.</li>
            <li>A great brush and a clean unlike any</li>
            <li>I find that it works great, my teeth feel clean and n earthy after every brush.</li>
            <li>Our older Oral-B battery was dying and this was a perfect replacement.  </li>
            <li>1000.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This does a great job at getting my teeth clean.</li>
            <li>Great clean feeling.</li>
            <li>Great product, leaves your teeth feeling silky clean.</li>
            <li>One of the best features is the alert to let you know the particular quadrant is done.</li>
            <li>It leaves my teeth feeling delightfully clean, and the timer feature works great.  </li>
            <li>This was an excellent replacement for an older Oral-B unit.</li>
            <li>This is the main reason I got this toothbrush as it stated this in the details, however this feature is nom- existent in my brush.&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise it&#x27;s really great!</li>
            <li>After a couple days my gums got used to the exceptional cleaning power and now brushing my teeth is so satisfying.  </li>
            <li>It does a very good job of dislodging seeds from strawberries and blueberries that I am not even aware they are between my teeth.  </li>
            <li>The packaging was very good and the instructions are clearly written with good illustrations.</li>
            <li>no brush can get, but it&#x27;s very good, leaves a nice smooth clean feel.  </li>
            <li>My new electric toothbrush is excellent and meets all my expectations.</li>
            <li>The new timiing device is perfect for brushing each quadrant and prevents one from over-brushing.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very good price and really helps cleaning all around my teeth; bright and fully clean!</li>
            <li>This electric toothbrush works great and recharges quickly.</li>
            <li>The timing device keeps you on track for a good check up and bright smile.  </li>
            <li>This is not an easy product to find or price in department stores or drugstores; it was a fair price for it and worked well.</li>
            <li>gets good reviews, but the vibrations are way too strong for me.  </li>
            <li>Looks good and feels strong.</li>
            <li>Great product and quickly shipped.</li>
            <li>Does a good job and is easily cleaned.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and the price is good.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a good product, does what it claims, and when used as directed, it might be worth the expense for those who can&#x27;t seem to get a good, thorough cleaning with those old-fashioned manual models.</li>
            <li>&quot; I don&#x27;t like the sensation of this 1000 series Oral-B toothbrush, it is very strong and</li>

            <li>this toothbrush is awesome so far!</li>
            <li>I like this toothbrush very much, it does an excellent job of brushing, holds a charge good and is light weight and easy to use.</li>
            <li>The downside, I&#x27;d say, is it takes more effort to clean the roof of your mouth and tongue, but this is a great toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I love it and a great clean feel</li>
            <li>Very very good toothbrush at a very affordable price.</li>

            <li>All in all, I&#x27;m impressed with the Oral-b Professional Care 1000.</li>
            <li>And I think it&#x27;s really a good deal when the rebate is still available.</li>
            <li>Oral B-1000 Professional electric toothbrush is an excellent, quality product.  </li>
            <li>I feel like I get the best results when using [[ASIN:B000AUIFCA Oral B Floss Action 3 pack brush head</li>
            <li>/&gt;Oral-B used to make a sonic toothbrush called the Sonic Complete which still remains the best toothbrush I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
            <li>So far, I am very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li>Ok ive been an amazon prime customer for 1 month and its amazing.</li>
            <li>Easy to hold , just does an exceptional job cleaning.</li>
            <li>So far, we&#x27;re very happy.</li>
            <li>These are powerful brushes and do a great job.  </li>
            <li>I was so pleased with the Oral-B 1000 unit, that I decided to buy another for my children to share (of course each with their own brush attachment).  </li>
            <li>Good mouth care is important to me.</li>
            <li>Bought this toothbrush and so far I am very happy with it and both my husband</li>
            <li>, it is more kind to my gums</li>
            <li>Works great and well worth the money.  </li>
            <li>Great replacement brush at economical price.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m looking for a good cheap head holder.</li>
            <li>I liked the water pick much better, but it also had issues with the charger and battery.  </li>
            <li>It is by far the best I have ever used.</li>
            <li>Product effective as described and quite satisfied.</li>
            <li>is far and away the best one I saw.</li>
            <li>I bought an Oral-B Triumph Professional Care two years ago and it&#x27;s wonderful.</li>
            <li>The toothbrush itself has, thus far, been excellent.</li>
            <li>so I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect out of it, to be honest</li>
            <li>I liked my ro to dent better.</li>
            <li>Excellent product- cleans thoroughly yet is not harsh.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Either way, great toothbrush, I made the right decision.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s still going strong!  </li>
            <li>it has certainly helped keep me cavity free and also kept my gums in great shape!</li>
            <li>good product; feels clean.</li>
            <li>Overall a great electric toothbrush for a great price.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Oral-B electric toothbrushes for many years and this is the best one so far.</li>
            <li>To be honest, I went by price, and had planned to use this one as an interim solution until I had more time to research and find a better one.</li>
            <li>The toothbrush is quite good and clean my teeth well.</li>
            <li>When I go to the dentist, I&#x27;m always told what good clean teeth I have.  </li>
            <li>Aside from the quality that it bestows, the rechargeable battery with light on the switch that would light up whenever you&#x27;ll need recharging is a great addition to the amenities of the toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li>Simple, does an amazing job and the price is perfect!</li>
            <li>dentist recommended this kind of toothbrush and I&#x27;m glad I was able to find it on sale.</li>
            <li>They promote the use of electric toothbrush, I agree that they work better than manual: more effective.  </li>
            <li>It works great &amp; is very reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>This one operates at a much higher speed and works GREAT with the floss action\\&quot; heads.  </li>
            <li>exactly what I wanted works great</li>
            <li>In general, a very wonderful appliance to have.</li>
            <li>This is a wonderful, powerful product, far superior to its step-down version.</li>
            <li>ok for the price, not as good as original</li>
            <li>Great unit better than the old one which we used and loved for years.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Good version of tried and true product.  </li>
            <li>a charge\\&quot; light comes on probably about every 4 days (probably because I put too much pressure on my teeth).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, great toothbrush, with the best feature being the timed brushing cycle to ensure a really thorough job.</li>
            <li>It feels very comfortable.</li>
            <li>Using it is very comfortable.  </li>
            <li>Everything works great and the toothbrush is able to really clean my teeth so that they feel smooth.</li>
            <li>Great toothbrush, really gives a good clean</li>
            <li>good product, arrived quickly, would recommend</li>
            <li>The design makes it easy to use and effective to use.</li>
            <li>Decided to go back to Braun and it is a great device and feels good to get a really good clean again.</li>
            <li>My teeth are far from perfect &amp; bleed easy while brushing.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use, efficient and comfortable, with a good battery life.  </li>
            <li>I buy a large pack of replacement heads for it once a year at Costco at a great price.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend the Oral-B Pro Healthy Clean Precision 1000, this is an awesome toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Ok, so the toothbrush itself probably deserves more than one star--it works fine, brushes nicely when you push the button, etc.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know why anyone would pay more for an electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>I purchased this toothbrush after reading several reviews that this brush is the best combination of effectiveness and price.</li>
            <li>IF YOU LOVE YOUR PARTNER &amp;</li>
            <li>I love the 2 minute timer that let&#x27;s me know when to</li>
            <li>I love the timer on it which keeps me brushing longer.  </li>
            <li>I do love this and prefer it to SonicCare which I had used for over a decade.</li>
            <li>Totally pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>I would have paid more for the two speed if I researched more.</li>
            <li>Now I feel confident that I&#x27;m doing my gums a favor.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure there is a reason for this hole, but I think it should go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been spoiled with this :)</li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>Lots more.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>So much cheaper than the store works great</li>
            <li>This is the third Oral B toothbrush I have purchased and I continue to be impressed by their products.</li>
            <li>The one I just purchased is for my daughter and she will love it.  </li>
            <li>Electric works better than manual, since you tend to brush longer and correctly.</li>
            <li>I wish they had made them at this price many years and many dental complications</li>
            <li>I wish they had made them at this price many years and many dental complications ago.</li>
            <li>This will help you remove more plaque from your teeth!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Electric Toothbrush cleans teeth much more than manual toothbrushes.</li>
            <li>The battery is not replaceable (it&#x27;s sealed, but probably for the better so water will not leak inside).</li>
            <li>Two satisfied customers.</li>
            <li>This toothbrush has much more power and cleans a lot better.  </li>
            <li>This is my second Oral-B electric toothbrush &amp; I have been very happy.</li>
            <li>make sure you wipe the metal rod that holds the brush head, as it comes in contact with water after use.</li>
            <li>I think the Oral-B cleans better and gets into the gumline as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I am satisfied with its performance.  </li>
            <li>and we both love it.</li>
            <li>I love my Oral-B.  </li>
            <li>i really love this thing..</li>
            <li>The brushing motion is much better too.</li>
            <li>and my gums are in better shape.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m sure this would message and vibrate (occuring in brush head)</li>
            <li>, if your dental setup is many caps, what is that doing to that glue?&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I hope this review costs you more than my $10 you stole.</li>
            <li>Great product at Reasonable price</li>
            <li>This is my second Oral B electric toothbrush, and I&#x27;ve been very happy with both of them.  </li>
            <li>and i&#x27;m extremely satisfied.</li>
            <li>I bought it because I figured the circular brush would provide greater range of motion than the rectangular shape of competitors.</li>
            <li>These are great tooth brushes at a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>After reading the specs on the many brands and models I settled on this one.</li>
            <li>/&gt;2)Cleans my teeth better than any mannual brush</li>
            <li>I like these heads better than the OEM brush</li>

            <li>I LOVE running my tongue over my teeth because it feels</li>
            <li>love the cup shaped bristles.</li>
            <li>sure you put the paste on by pushing it into the brush and then insert the brush in your mouth before pushing the on button.  </li>
            <li>The paste will just jump off the brush if you put a bit on top and turn it on.</li>
            <li>and I am glad to say that it does.</li>
            <li>At the end of two minutes you hear and feel some more vibreations</li>
            <li>My gums don&#x27;t tingle any more</li>
            <li>Updated review with more detail to explain my 1 star opinion---&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>you are shopping for an electric toothbrush you need to know there are many options on the market, even with this latest series by Oral-B</li>

            <li>i really love the timer.  </li>
            <li>I found out that all except the Oral B 1000 cost more money and gave you (1) longer battery life  </li>
            <li>useful though this is good for those who brush in quadrants.  </li>
            <li>Therefore, you can not use it on most of the countries.</li>
            <li>and I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok.</li>

            <li>my dentist said my teeth look better after using it.</li>

            <li>I didn&#x27;t want to pay for more than one brush head.  </li>

            <li>It only needs to be charged once per week, which is great for kids!</li>
            <li>My Sonic Care wasn’t able to get the job done after many years of use.  </li>
            <li>I still love how well it cleans my teeth.</li>
            <li>It has so many alerts that you start to ignore them and might miss the two minute alert.</li>

            <li>gives you better precision and is easier to maintain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this because I brush for 3 mins not 2.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>

            <li>This was a replacement and it works even better than the one I had.</li>
            <li>Better to keep it on the stand</li>
            <li>, the amazon locker system is absolutely fantastic!</li>

            <li>love</li>
            <li>/&gt;Now if you can spend more, the difference between the sonicare and the oral b is a toss up, but at this price range you deffinitely should go with the sonicare.</li>

            <li>Best to order extra heads when buying toothbrush.</li>
            <li>The starter level Oral B is actually OK, but the difference in the cleaning, longer charge, improved timer and better power</li>

            <li>love it more</li>
            <li>The thing that bothers me most is that they had a gift coupon offer and when you went to that website, it had already been used up by the number of applicants.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>You can pay more buying online</li>
            <li>I would prefer the 2 minute alert and nothing more.</li>
            <li>Combine it with flossing and you are on your way to healthy gums and teeth.</li>

            <li>Love this thing.  </li>
            <li>Cute color</li>
            <li>These were a better deal here than we could find elsewhere.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I was pleased with the construction and value of this battery operated</li>
            <li>It is not as advertised for two weeks, more like 4 - 5 days, twice per day.</li>
            <li>The hygienist suggested an electric toothbrush to do a better job of removing plaque at the gumline.</li>
            <li>Also the battery lasts for many uses between charges.</li>
            <li>Absolutely love the electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Much better than the battery version.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>MY HUSBAND LOVE IT...</li>
            <li>One of the better purchases I have made in years.</li>
            <li>and I think I like this one the most.</li>
            <li>I like way better then</li>
            <li>She loves it and says it cleans her teeth better than a manual toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Instructions could have been written better.  </li>
            <li>But I wanted to buy an extra one for my girlfriend&#x27;s place and this one was perfect for the price.  </li>
            <li>Alternatively, the charge lasts for 14 two-minute brush sessions (or one week of twice per day use), so one could just plug it in when leaving in the morning and unplug at night, then wait another week to do the same.&lt;br /&gt;  Overall, very happy with this item.</li>
            <li>This basic product is awesome.  </li>
            <li>Once it hits 2 minutes, it does a longer stop sequence, then continues brushing if you want to brush more</li>
            <li>I love the timer feature.</li>
            <li>, I didn&#x27;t think the 1000 was doing a better job than my manual brushing that I&#x27;ve been doing now for over 60 years, BUT...</li>
            <li>Better dental check ups and cudos from the dental hygienist</li>
            <li>I got this for $25 after rebate from walmart.com yesterday, I already love it.  </li>
            <li>Love these tooth brushes.  </li>
            <li>Great for dental health, compact with reasonably priced replacement brushes.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I believe this one cleans better.  </li>
            <li>Love this brush</li>
            <li>I love my electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li>The units work very well and the feeling after cleaning our teeth is great.</li>
            <li>The brush is also softer than the Philips, which combined with the \\&quot;vigorous\\&quot; quality makes it better for gum</li>
            <li>My teeth and gums love it.</li>
            <li>My dentist love s</li>
            <li>Furthermore, rechargeable keeps its energy up, meaning it spins better than it does with a dying battery.</li>
            <li>Sure the bells and whistles aren&#x27;t all there</li>
            <li>Do this and your dentist will love you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The brushing speed and timing features signal this out as an outstanding performer.</li>
            <li>What more could anyone ask for?</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>Have purchased several items via Amazon and have been very happy with results.</li>
            <li>Plus I was able to process a $20 rebate from Proctor and Gamble</li>
            <li>Glad i made the switch.</li>
            <li>This toothbrush just seems to have more... vigor to it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m extremely pleased with this electric toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>But this 1000 is a hundred times better than</li>
            <li>The brush head is great that it comes with, and really feels like it does the job.  </li>
            <li>Look elsewhere for a better unit.</li>
            <li>Got this for my daughter and have had much better brushing results.</li>
            <li>I really love this toothbrush.</li>
            <li>This oscillates faster, cleans better, and vibrates every 30 seconds to assist in the brushing process.</li>
            <li>Fabulous tooth brush!  </li>
            <li>I have used the Oral B Electric Toothbrushes for more than a decade.</li>
            <li>wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge for more than 12 hours.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m glad I bought this brush instead of another Sonicare.</li>
            <li>and I love them.</li>
            <li>Great electric toothbrush at a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>I love how it is aggressive with its cleaning power.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I have been using it now for over a month and am completely satisfied.</li>
            <li>It seems like most people dont have that problem</li>
            <li>There is a 2 minute timer to help obtain the best possible cleaning of your teeth.  </li>
            <li>Wish it came with one more toothbrush head.</li>
            <li>The quality of design and construction seems to keep getting better.</li>
            <li>This toothbrush really does a great job.</li>
            <li>These heads do a better job creating the \\&quot;bubbles\\&quot; from the toothpaste.</li>
            <li>Oh, I needed more words.</li>
            <li>you to spend more time brushing (2 minutes)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love all Oral-B products.</li>
            <li>be part of your routine and you&#x27;ll feel better too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love the price and how this toothbrush works.  </li>
            <li>Since the more pricey electric tbrushes NEVER SEEM TO GO ON SALE</li>
            <li>I love the compact brush head and the cleaning</li>
            <li>Ask any dentist, these things are better than toothbrushes...who knew?  </li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>Perfectly OK.  </li>
            <li>I guess its just OK. .</li>
            <li>Recipiant seemed pleased when it was opened.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>It takes many many hours, but, oh well...</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t ask for more.</li>
            <li>and I like it even better than my Sonicare brush.</li>
            <li>Love It.</li>
            <li>It works so much better than my 20-year-old Braun electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Like that Amazon had many to choose from.</li>
            <li>Overall, very happy with purchase.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure I buy another when the time comes.</li>
            <li>This toothbrush is such a wonderful investment.  </li>
            <li>But this is not at all a problem because it holds it&#x27;s charge forever- literally. :-)  </li>
            <li>I have updated my rating to 5 stars after using this brush for the better part of a year.</li>
            <li>Much better than a manual toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Seems to get between the teeth better.</li>
            <li>I love mine and do trust Oral B.  </li>
            <li>The only drawback I see that there is no cover for its head or no case to put this awesome toothbrush in.</li>
            <li>I love using this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>to just confirm it should be okay to use a brush like this on teeth with fillings and buckles etc</li>
            <li>which despite my most gung ho efforts has always been a &amp;#34;do</li>
            <li>better job&amp;#34</li>
            <li>better than the vibrating one</li>
            <li>awesome toothbrush, makes it fun haha</li>
            <li>I love this brush.</li>
            <li>This toothbrush is one of the most inexpensive ones!&lt;br /&gt;Needless to say… it&#x27;s already my favorite Oral-B.</li>
            <li>and I may buy some more for my grandkids.</li>
            <li>much more thorough than a manual tooth brush.  </li>
            <li>I think the 3 month thing is just more of a way to get people to buy brush heads more often</li>
            <li>then they need to make more money.  </li>
            <li>can&#x27;t ask for more then that.</li>
            <li>It really does a great job in 2 minutes.  </li>
            <li>Teeth feel great and super clean after each use.</li>
            <li>When you change a habit for many decades, and the product amaze you.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This (plus its stand)  is more conducive to packing for overnights.</li>
            <li>I love this electric tooth brush.  </li>
            <li>Bought the newer version and have been greatly pleased with it.</li>
            <li>This toothbrush is okay.  </li>
            <li>I really love this tooth brush.  </li>
            <li>Love this brush.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I followed their advice.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love this thing.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve been pleased with it.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t believe you will get a better product for the price.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Things I think are better about the Oral-B:&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>My mom was so impressed that she bought the same one.</li>
            <li>Better than the one my dentist sold me for $160.00.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a former dental hygienist and very happy with the results.</li>
            <li>No complaints yet, keep it charged up every couple of days to make sure the brush is at optimal speed.</li>
            <li>I have used Oral B electric toothbrushes for many years.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to order one more for my boyfriend.</li>
            <li>I am extremely pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li>I love the Oral-B electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I feel as if I get a better brushing as opposed to manual brushing.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s definitely better than a manual toothbrush.</li>
            <li>OK product.  </li>
            <li>My wife and I love the Oral Pro 1000.</li>
            <li>LOVE it.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m sure my family could also use this.</li>
            <li>A rebate made it an even better deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Top notch product.  </li>
            <li>I love the way my mouth feels.</li>
            <li>I just need to order some more heads for my family</li>
            <li>A thousand times better than brushing manually.</li>
            <li>Fresher breath thus making me more confident.</li>
            <li>As I said, it&#x27;s OK</li>
            <li>Better On/</li>
            <li>Better On/</li>
            <li>I love this Oral-B electric toothbrush, and my experiences with Oral-B electric toothbrushes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I got it.</li>
            <li>I love this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m definitely glad I got it.  </li>
            <li>Great service, received the product very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;Great product, just as represented.</li>
            <li>My favorite is the &amp;#34;floss action&amp;#34; brush.</li>
            <li>I love this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>Take the charger with you if you are traveling for more than 1 night.</li>
            <li>discussed me most was the rebate promised.  </li>
            <li>and I love it.  </li>
            <li>I phoned them and they asked me to read the rebate form one more time</li>
            <li>Ok, so what happens when I send in a photocopy</li>
            <li>I love this electric toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>Love the tooth brush.</li>
            <li>I should have known better than to buy a cheaper model.</li>
            <li>I love the electric brush.</li>
            <li>sure that you could pay a lot more</li>
            <li>She said to do with the plug in models as they have more power than the battery operated ones.  </li>
            <li>They do an outstanding job at cleaning teeth.</li>
            <li>I have been cavity free for over 2 years now!</li>
            <li>I like it  much better than Sonicare, which I had been using for many years.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;It fits over and around each tooth and probably does a better job.  </li>
            <li>We love our Oral-B toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li>Love it, works so well and whitens my teeth.  </li>
            <li>I get much better removal of tartar with this electric toothbrush than by hand brushing.</li>
            <li>Even though I wash the brush after use, toothpaste deposits build up on the top of the charging unit and these smell after a week or two.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re not making them like they used to , to last forever, but is probably still the best quality you can get out of an electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I so love mine and get better checkups</li>
            <li>My dentist recommended an electric toothbrush and I am glad I got this one.</li>
            <li>Works much better than those battery operated brushes.  </li>
            <li>I have been using Oral b toothbrush for many years.  </li>
            <li>Did not think I needed or would like the timer which seemed to come with most of them but</li>
            <li>and I love the timer.  </li>
            <li>It helps you make sure you get all 4 quadrants for 30 seconds each.</li>
            <li>Glad we did as it is MUCH better in my opinion.  </li>
            <li>My husband likes it much better also.</li>
            <li>I love this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>Be sure to check the Oral-B website for any rebates.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Since your satisfaction means a great deal to us, I’m also sending a money saving coupon that would be good towards your next purchase of an Oral-B rechargeable toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I gave this to my kids and they love it</li>
            <li>It would be perfect if the brush head is bigger.</li>
            <li>It had a place on the recharger stand to store the brushes and also came with more then on brush.</li>
            <li>Mine was a lower quality than this one and I am glad I replaced it.</li>
            <li>I feel like this is a great model because you&#x27;re not paying for all the bells and whistles that you don&#x27;t really need.</li>
            <li>This model makes brushing teeth much more enjoyable.  </li>
            <li>This brush feels more like a hygienist&#x27;s appliance and allows your teeth to feel well cleaned.  </li>
            <li>Just give it more time.</li>
            <li>The vibration of the Oral-B is a bit noisier and there&#x27;s more of it.  </li>
            <li>really glad I chose the upgrade &amp;#34;professional&amp;#34; compared to the &amp;#34;vitality&amp;#34; ($15 price difference)</li>
            <li>because although I&#x27;m sure it doesn&#x27;t cost the manufacturer to make it pause, the pause every 30 seconds helps me remember to switch quadrants.</li>
            <li>someone from Oral B is reading this, please give me more coupons for the heads.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>and I know that it is keeping my gums healthy.</li>
            <li>though you may get a much better one with 200+ dollars</li>
            <li>you will enjoy it, as well!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this brush for a couple of weeks now, and I love it.</li>
            <li>Love the item and the circular rotation on the brush.</li>
            <li>I love this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>Thirty seconds with this is better than thirty seconds by</li>
            <li>We were much more</li>
            <li>Works even better than anticipated.  </li>
            <li>the Sonicare wasn&#x27;t touching.</li>
            <li>But, I am pleased with the way it cleans my teeth.  </li>
            <li>This Oral B electric toothbrush cleans very well, is somewhat quite and alerts you when you need to recharge, Great value for the cost.</li>
            <li>But this did not bode well for an appropriate lifespan, so we returned them.</li>
            <li>Love this toothbrush.</li>
            <li>so I know it must be so much better than my manual brush was.</li>
            <li>Completely satisfied with delivery and performance of the product</li>
            <li>I say thanks to this brush, it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li>My periodontist recommended this type of spin brush over the $10 variety and it has produced noticeably better results for my gums.  </li>
            <li>still like this brand better then others, but probably would not get this model again&lt;</li>
            <li>I was on the verge of having periodontal disease and after 2 months of using this, my dentist says my gums are in top notch shape.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been able to save money because now I see the dentist</li>
            <li>I love this tooth brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ive</li>
            <li>I love this -</li>
            <li>but I am satisfied with it.  </li>
            <li>and I love it.  </li>
            <li>I figure that they&#x27;ll lose a lot more money on me than they gained by screwing me on a rebate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>You can stop the brush at that point to add more toothpaste (I use baking soda myself) and press it again.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s more of a marketing tool to get you to buy replacement heads more often, but you can use that as a reminder if you prefer.</li>
            <li>It also probably does a better job without brushing too hard.&lt;br</li>
            <li>And since it is reasonably priced, I am happy.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>I love this one.</li>
            <li>Not to many pros.</li>
            <li>Simple but works great!</li>
            <li>It also does a better job cleaning my teeth.  </li>
            <li>Sadly many products are no longer made the way they used to be.</li>
            <li>But NiMH is better for the environment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I know my teeth and gums feel better.</li>
            <li>The brush itself does an outstanding job.</li>
            <li>Much better than the ones we had.</li>
            <li>This is just OK.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Even better than my sonic that I had.</li>
            <li>but I still love it.</li>
            <li>Just rinse it more, you say?</li>
            <li>I even remove the top to rinse it out</li>
            <li>I gave these as a gift and my friend thought it was very powerful for a toothbrush, said she liked that</li>
            <li>So this is great to take for quick business trips as I can take up to a full week without having to take the charging stand along.  </li>
            <li>I will say though, that if my 1000 dies, I&#x27;ll wait for a good sale on a replacement rather than run right out and buy a replacement the day the 1000 died.</li>
            <li>feels right and does a good job.  </li>
            <li>It really does a very good job at cleaning and having it feel clean.</li>
            <li>The Oral-B professional Healthy Clean Precision 1000 Rechargeable Electric Tooth Brush is GREAT!!</li>
            <li>This Oral-B Professional Healthy Clean Precision 1000 by Braun is an excellent product that we can depend on day after day to attain exemplary oral hygiene care.  </li>
            <li>The Oral-B Professional Healthy Clean Precision 1000 Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush is the best there is on the market.</li>
            <li>Looking forward to some ramdom special order to purchase 3 more for my family!</li>
            <li>The person really likes it and has had better check-ups as a result!!</li>
            <li>We owned an older model for many years and were fairly happy with it.</li>
            <li>but you&#x27;ll still get a clean smile that will make your hygienist proud of you.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive teeth and gums and this toothbrush is perfect, it does not irritate them all and my teeth feel squeaky clean.  </li>
            <li>Teeth feel very clean and I have more confidence that I am reaching all the areas in my mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I was very excited to get it.</li>
            <li>So it&#x27;s a great brush, I just have no idea why they have come out with a new model!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an amazing brush and my teeth feel incredibly clean after I brush with it.  </li>
            <li>And you get a nice clean feeling mouth if you brush for the recommended two minutes.</li>
            <li>After I use it my teeth feel nice and clean.</li>
            <li>in all a wonderful addition to my toilet</li>
            <li>Leaves my teeth feeling nice and clean.  </li>
            <li>I have been using Oral B Electric toothbrushes for many years and from the first loved it.</li>
            <li>I am using the older version since 2001 and it still works great.</li>
            <li>Great product that I would recommend highly.</li>
            <li>Love how clean this makes my mouth feel!</li>
            <li>Takes some getting used to but love how clean my teeth feel after!</li>
            <li>and he said I had super healthy gums and teeth!</li>

            <li>My teeth feel very clean.</li>
            <li>well sometimes I don not use toothpaste and it still leaves your teeth with a very clean feeling.</li>
            <li>It also leaves your teeth very clean.</li>
            <li>Very.. clean that is.  </li>
            <li>Teeth feel very clean after use</li>
            <li>This has helped me have very clean teeth even though I brush in a rush.</li>
            <li>My teeth and gums feel very clean after using it.</li>
            <li>My mouth and teeth feel very clean once I&#x27;m done and my teeth are already looking whiter.  </li>

            <li>Liked it so much, bought two more for family members!</li>
            <li>It works pretty well, it holds a good charge, and also cleans my teeth</li>
            <li>/&gt;Works flawlessly and the timers on it makes it easier for my kids to understand how long they need to brush.</li>
            <li>pretty good</li>
            <li>but if you can&#x27;t this is still pretty good.</li>

            <li>Although not the most powerful electric toothbrush I have owned, it is effective and holds a charge for many days.</li>
            <li>I loved this toothbrush when I first got it</li>
            <li>Loved my first brush and it lasted for years.</li>
            <li>Nice to think a company out there doesn&#x27;t obsolete a perfectly good induction charging system just because it is a decade (or more) old.</li>
            <li>He is very happy with it and wishes he had asked for it long ago.  </li>
            <li>Excellent product.&lt;br /&gt;Waiting to see how long the head lasts and the cost of replacement.</li>
            <li>Went right back to my Oral-B.  Great value for a great product.</li>
            <li>You won&#x27;t get it if the seller doesn&#x27;t send you the original rebate form and receipt!</li>
            <li>I am really happy with ,y new toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Price is great, it has a lot of power to blast those unsightly bits of animal tendon and pesky escargot tails from betwixt your newly polished fangs.</li>
            <li>requested a new one, but great product</li>
            <li>Easy to use and definitely better for the teeth and gums.</li>
            <li>quickly (because of no need for my own maneuvering, which I was overdoing.)&lt;br</li>
            <li>Nice,  effective cleaning of the teeth, and removal of plaque, leaves a sensation fresh and clean</li>
            <li>My teeth feel especially clean when I go through the whole 2 min routine.  </li>
            <li>This replacement and step-up is dramatically better, - it easily holds a charge for a week without recharging.</li>
            <li>Effective; charges quickly.</li>
            <li>Love how strong it is.</li>
            <li>The toothbrush easily serves all MY needs -- but MAYBE others are better.  </li>
            <li>I love this toothbrush so far it works great.</li>
            <li>I feel like it works better and is more comfortable to use.</li>
            <li>It was cost effective, simple (just one power button), and does a great job cleaning your teeth and Dentists agree.</li>
            <li>Very useful and easy to use!</li>
            <li>Stand for the toothbrush is sleek and very easy to clean.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a great upgrade from those cheap AA battery powered toothbrushes and couldn&#x27;t come more highly recommended.  </li>
            <li>This one is the best, and I couldn&#x27;t believe it lasted 16 days on a single charge.  </li>
            <li>The Healthy Clean Precision 1000 toothbrush does a fine job of cleaning our teeth - you can ask our dentists!</li>
            <li>This brush has the right amount of pressure to keep my teeth and gums nice and healthy.</li>
            <li>Great fast service and my teeth look great after only a week :)</li>
            <li>This model is fine for me, don&#x27;t need to spend more money for a fancier brush.</li>
            <li>My teeth feel so clean!</li>
            <li>are so clean!  </li>
            <li>recommend this electric toothbrush for everyone who want to keep her teeth clean!</li>
            <li>My teeth feel as clean as after the dentist!  </li>
            <li>On a side bonus...you can clean your rings with it!</li>
            <li>Clean teeth !&lt;</li>
            <li>This one has more power and suits me just fine.</li>
            <li>Does the job well, makes my mouth feel clean and no changing batteries every 2 months!</li>
            <li>If you want clean teeth you need an electronic toothbrush!</li>
            <li>I LOVE it and recommend it to everyone because it does clean your teeth MUCH better than a manual brush</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had an electric brush in ages and it&#x27;s wonderful to have really clean teeth again without gag-inducing giant toothbrush heads.</li>
            <li>rotation of the brush is simply put, the best way to clean your teeth.</li>
            <li>Very good product and the second one we have purchased.</li>
            <li>Very simple, very good.</li>
            <li>Overall very good quality.</li>
            <li>The automatic pressure shut-off is great for people with sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li>I didnt think that i would b e using that feature, but it is really becoming part of my morning routine (and brushing will take another 2 minutes, so</li>
            <li>I love the prices and the free shipping.</li>
            <li>, everything else is great - used it to replace a 3 year old Oral-B Pro...</li>
            <li>This latest one seems to operate at a higher speed, which we like, and it has a nice balance when handling.</li>
            <li>We have tried the cheap ones found in most department stores and besides them being huge and bulky they never seem to work for more than a couple months.</li>
            <li>Electric brushes can be a good thing - there is quite a bit more cleaning action going on because the automatic brush strokes are way faster than your hand can perform so you will always get better cleaning.  </li>
            <li>It gets everywhere in between including at the most important gum line.</li>
            <li>A gift for a person who didn&#x27;t like to brush his teeth and, like me, now finds it enjoyable, including a light massage of the gums.  </li>
            <li>I can also apply more pressure with the Oral-B (important for cleaning molars).  </li>
            <li>used to use the Vitality model, but this one is sleeker, quieter, shows its charge level and - most importantly - has a &amp;#34;quad pacer&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>I know I will enjoy this for many years.</li>
            <li>The 1000 is a great toothbrush that works as well as my old one.</li>
            <li>The toothbrush itself is great, but I&#x27;ve bought two of these so far and</li>
            <li>I was so impressed that I bought a pink one for my wife and she loves it.  </li>
            <li>This is the first time I used an electric toothbrush and this toothbrush meets my expectations - very satisfied, no hesitation recommending.</li>
            <li>Our old one was wearing out--the head would come off; so this  one was just great.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking to try a real electric toothbrush (not the Oral-B Pulsar cheapies), this is a good entry point.</li>
            <li>so the timer doesn&#x27;t really do a lot of good although I do like having it</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s reasonably priced and does a really good job of getting my teeth &amp;#34;squeaky clean&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>good product, fast delivery</li>
            <li>and I loved it so much that I bought one for my boyfriend.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good product for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>Effect is good, very like</li>
            <li>verdict: a good electric toothbrush at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>verdict: a good electric toothbrush at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>1st electric toothbrush, works very well, holds a good charge and is efficient at cleaning teeth.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean, easy to use, and very easy to carry around.</li>
            <li>Seems to be more effective with it&#x27;s rotating vibrations, and the whole thing is a bit more streamlined and easily stored.</li>
            <li>new stutter timing feature is great; flashing light while recharging; slimmer, cleaner design in handle and recharging stand.  </li>
            <li>I was happy to find the toothbrush heads still fit a new model.&lt;br /&gt;After purchasing this product and using it for about a month</li>
            <li>Finally, an electric toothbrush that is pleasant to use and effective at removing plaque.</li>
            <li>It is unbelievably fast and strong and does a good job.</li>
            <li>It meets U.S. code&#x27;s definition of mail fraud--\\&quot;having devised or intending to devise a scheme to defraud....use of the mail for the purpose of executing, or attempting to execute, the scheme.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put great care into sending an Amazon receipt, the properly filled out rebate form, and the original UPC from the toothbrush in a VERY well-sealed (tape reinforced)</li>
            <li>This new rechargeable toothbrush is amazing!</li>
            <li>There was a nice rebate on this and the price was right.</li>
            <li>very cheap, Overall a great product for its price.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a pretty good toothbrush, makes my teeth feel clean.  </li>
            <li>It leaves your teeth feeling very clean and smooth.  </li>
            <li>I have used other electric tooth brushes but this is the best.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny! :-)</li>
            <li>The original toothbrush was OK, but seemed to be loosing the capacity to recharge.</li>
            <li>Used this for the first time today and I love it!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other ones, but this is perfect.  </li>
            <li>I saved a lot of money as compared to other retailers like target, and it works great!</li>
            <li>This toothbrush is updating an Oral B electric toothbrush I&#x27;ve been using for over 8 years now and can&#x27;t say enough good things about it!  </li>
            <li>Oral-B is a great brand and this unit has extra-soft brush heads available for those with sensitive gums (like me).</li>
            <li>Easy to use.  </li>
            <li>I feel like I&#x27;m able to get every nook and cranny of my teeth clean.</li>
            <li>Easy to charge.</li>
            <li>Easy to set up.</li>
            <li>Whether you currently use an electric toothbrush or have never used one before, you&#x27;ll most probably be happy with it.</li>
            <li>and I love the &#x27;Precision Clean&#x27; style brush head.</li>
            <li>I take it with me when I travel, easily fits in a zip lock bag and into the suitcase.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>No complaints, it works as it should... and is sooooo much better to get teeth clean than a manual brush.</li>
            <li>and I can&#x27;t tell you how clean, smooth and shiney my teeth felt after one use!</li>
            <li>I just replace the brush by then because they are continuously releasing better and more powerful models.</li>
            <li>Easy peasy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy on the gums, too.  </li>
            <li>It was easy to order another.  </li>
            <li>Easy to charge.</li>

            <li>Arrived very quickly.</li>
            <li>and it fits quite easily on the charger.</li>
            <li>This is easy to pack to travel, it does not have all those accessories some of them have.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t tip as easily as you&#x27;d think.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;Recommend.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>I love this product - my mouth feels so clean and do not even feel the need for flossing.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s easy to use and recharge.  </li>
            <li>THe button to start the brush doesn&#x27;t work easily</li>

            <li>Easy to use</li>
            <li>, I like all the optional brush heads available, unlike sonic-care,It cleans very well and leaves your gums feeling good</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>It leaves my teeth feeling more clean and also seems to clean between the teeth better.</li>
            <li>So easy to use and charge,</li>
            <li>My teeth felt sparkling clean after most uses, although I found that the heads seemed to fray and wear out a bit faster than the product claimed they would.</li>
            <li>that replacement brushes are easy to find and the model does not become obsolete.</li>
            <li>It such a great job that I bought more for the rest of the family.</li>

            <li>Easy to use.</li>

            <li>It is easy to use and can be tucked into a suitcase.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s still going strong.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had it for a couple of months and it is still running strong.  </li>
            <li>So far, done a good job, battery life is a week or more.</li>
            <li>the toothbrush is strong so there are days when i dont feel well and using this made me feel nauseous believe it or not.</li>
            <li>To prolong the life of the battery I would strongly recommend not putting it on the charger after every use.</li>
            <li>Did the Vitality ever feel this strong?  </li>
            <li>Strongly recommend this product to every one.</li>
            <li>I would strongly recommend buying this.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s way too strong.</li>
            <li>this Oral-B is still going strong.</li>
            <li>: It is now October 2015 and this product is still going strong.</li>
            <li>rechargeable battery is still going strong, which was a concern of mine when purchasing.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Mine has been going strong with no issues.</li>
            <li>Strongly recommended.</li>

            <li>Lightweight, runs strong, lets you know every 30 seconds to move along for 2 minutes of brushing (brush your mouth in 1/4s).</li>
            <li>It seems to run at a high speed all the way up until it stops, and that is good.  </li>
            <li>When I began to receive a fully charged with the electric toothbrush is very clean, very comfortable, and the price is very cheap, very grateful</li>
            <li>I love my new tooth brush, teeth and gums feel very healthy.</li>
            <li>so now I feel I can get the benefit of the better electric toothbrush without worrying that I am not doing it right!</li>
            <li>Able to notice a difference right away and continues to get better over time.</li>
            <li>My mouth feels very clean &amp; fresh!</li>
            <li>My mouth feels very clean &amp; fresh!</li>
            <li>I was a bit sceptical about this product at first, thinking it was just something my dentist was endorsing, but I must say, it truly is amazing.</li>
            <li>Very pleased with whole experience.</li>
            <li>Love the full rotating spin of this brush.  </li>
            <li>The battery on this is much better, it charges quickly, and I feel that I get a better clean.</li>
            <li>This hot charger and burnt gunk make it hazardous, I think.</li>
            <li>And the battery is also good, normal</li>
            <li>I had used the first version of the Oral B electric cleaner and this is a nice improvement.  </li>
            <li>Super happy with my new toothbrush.</li>
            <li>It takes down plaque beautifully!</li>
            <li>but as I get older its nice to know what I&#x27;ve covered :-)</li>
            <li>I got this to replace my older version - which is 8 years old &amp; still worked perfectly.  </li>
            <li>My husband and kids are happily still using their SMART SERIES with an LCD panel that tells them if they are pressing too hard.r reading of exactly what the 1000 series could do.</li>
            <li>Re-chargable stand helps you avoid the hassle of changing batteries (and yes, it really is a hassle) and best of all the heads are easily available from after market sellers, through Amazon no less.</li>
            <li>It comes with a standard head, which is good, but can use and a more advanced Oral B brush, which is better.</li>
            <li>It massages the gums very well and leaves your teeth with a nice, clean, polished feeling!</li>
            <li>new one I have is extremely good.</li>
            <li>This new toothbrush , I must say, is not as good as that toothbrush.</li>
            <li>the new one is superior.</li>
            <li>and  works just fine.</li>
            <li>I like it just fine.</li>
            <li>I took a step up to the Professional and am very glad I did, it seems to do a better job, but</li>
            <li>at first i thought sonicare would be better because it has more vibration..</li>
            <li>I bought this toothbrush and the Oral-B Power Sensative Replacement Electric Toothbrush Heads, and they work fine for me.</li>
            <li>Product is fine, works well.</li>
            <li>also the speed it uses seems fine...</li>
            <li>I like the light weight easy to handle slender brush .</li>
            <li>Fine with us.  </li>
            <li>The toothbrush works fine</li>
            <li>Speed and pressure is fine.</li>
            <li>This is the best toothbrush that costs less than 30 dollars.</li>
            <li>Wrap up your cord well and it&#x27;ll be fine.  </li>
            <li>Surely, the round brush head give me the best clean.</li>
            <li>but it works fine.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m giving it 2 stars because, when the battery has juice, the toothbrush functions just fine.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to anyone who wants a great toothbrush but doesn&#x27;t care to spend a ton of money on the higher priced versions.</li>
            <li>and it seems to be fine now.</li>
            <li>This brush will do the job just fine.</li>
            <li>I works fine and cleans my teeth.</li>
            <li>The diameter of the bristles is fine</li>
            <li>The diameter of the bristles is fine</li>
            <li>and it now works fine.  </li>
            <li>Otherwise it seems fine.</li>
            <li>Working fine and exhibits a lot of power for the cost.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve used mine for 3 years now and it still works fine.  </li>
            <li>My teeth were already in fine shape, so given that</li>
            <li>These are just fine for the product they are adaptable to.</li>
            <li>I must say it makes teeth brush more effective than normal way.</li>
            <li>Cleans teeth and gums just fine.</li>
            <li>Replacement brushes are readily available and easy to replace.</li>
            <li>Comfortable to hold and easy to use for children &amp; adults.</li>
            <li>As others have written this Model 1000 does a fine job of cleaning my teeth.</li>
            <li>It is fine to use when the battery works.&lt;br /&gt;But, now the battery died, and it cannot be used anymore.</li>
            <li>Fine, I switched.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Perfect for teeth I can tell teeth cleaner already less plaque</li>
            <li>It is easy and comfortable to use.</li>
            <li>My newest Oral-B does as fine a job of cleaning as its predecessors did.  </li>
            <li>but it is fine.  </li>
            <li>I have used an electric toothbrush before, and I was less than impressed.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;That&#x27;s fine if you brush leaning over the sink, but if you don&#x27;t, you&#x27;re going to be wiping up drips from your feet or the floor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>love the 4x30sec cycles for each quarter of the teeth, it disciplines me into adequately brushing my teeth every time.</li>
            <li>After 1000, that one feels so mild, more for gums, rather than teeth.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always had good luck with Oral-B Professional Healthy Clean Products.  </li>
            <li>Super pleased with this purchased and my teeth</li>
            <li>I bought this as I read that the Sonicare rotates too quickly for most people&#x27;s gums.  </li>
            <li>It does a super job and stays charged many days.  </li>
            <li>Bold charge it!</li>
            <li>This toothbrush is fantastic, spins very fast and really does a great job of removing tarter, couldn&#x27;t beat the price that I got it for on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Good product so far!</li>
            <li>When ordering this product, because I live in Australia and our voltage is 220 volt, I would have thought I would receive one suitable for our voltage but instead received 110 - 130 volt one (suitable for USA).  </li>
            <li>I was thrilled to find the new one is faster and has more features that I didn&#x27;t know it had.  </li>
            <li>Felt more substantial, longer lasting and pleasant than my wife&#x27;s $12 vibrating brush.</li>
            <li>and i thank all those who gave it positive ones, for the more &amp;#34;professional&amp;#34; users i guess there are many things you can nitpick about.</li>
            <li>it washes very clean, it has a light to indicate when you need to charge and when it will become full.</li>
            <li>Wish that this one came with the little adapter to hold two brushes, that would have made this perfect.  </li>
            <li>Having had dental issues, the electric toothbrush is the only solution to making sure that teeth get clean!!!  </li>
            <li>Very satisfied and highly recommend.  </li>
            <li>The only reason for not giving it 5 starts is when the device is charging the flashing LED is rather bright and reminds me of a large, bright outdoor sign flashing on and off.</li>
            <li>The brushing action is very good and better than our old brush.  </li>
            <li>You get a very clean after dentist visit feeling the very first time you use it.</li>
            <li>but this was a huge disappointment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;The problem, and its a huge problem, is cleaning the brush.</li>
            <li>and there is a huge difference in the results.</li>
            <li>We tried these and what a huge difference.</li>
            <li>very basic function..but great product.</li>
            <li>When you run your tongue over your teeth and you&#x27;ll feel the smooth difference.  </li>
            <li>Fantastic.  </li>
            <li>I replaced that one with a cheap model, also an Oral-B.  </li>
            <li>Makes my teeth feel so smooth again.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s fantastic!I used it daily and feel great.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to clean and water doesnt get inside it.</li>
            <li>I was happy with the Triumph which had an LCD display showing digital brushing time, tells when to replace the toothbrush head, charging status, etc.</li>
            <li>The newer model is quieter and has an added bonus of a light that shows when it needs to be recharged.  </li>
            <li>I really enjoy it and because of that the 2 minutes of brushing go quicker than I&#x27;d like.</li>
            <li>The cupped design works great, especially around the posterior teeth.</li>
            <li>This is the second Oral-B toothbrush I have purchased and they both are great.  </li>
            <li>Before this brush, I used the cheap $13 oral b electric precision toothbrush that was made in china and it is nothing in power compared to this.</li>
            <li>But, why would a light bother anyone?</li>
            <li>I bought mine for $38 free shipping on another site.</li>
            <li>I did have to velcro the charger to the counter.&lt;br /&gt;6)Very easy to keep clean.</li>
            <li>I paid $44.65 for the tooth brush and a year of brush heads, cleans my teeth, easy to keeep clean, will not fall off the charger.</li>
            <li>why is there a light to tell me, that the battery is loading?</li>
            <li>I am soooo happy to be back to the Oral B -</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is the loudest, most powerful toothbrush I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
            <li>Groupon had refills for cheap and you don&#x27;t need to switch until every 3-6 months.  </li>
            <li>It might be a bit more powerful or maybe that&#x27;s just because it&#x27;s newer.</li>
            <li>The bottom line is that it does a better job than you can do yourself, and your teeth are worth the investment.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, I really enjoy the feeling of the brush head on my gums and teeth.</li>
            <li>The tooth brush on the charger is nice and slim and does not take up much space.</li>
            <li>I had the cheap version before.  </li>
            <li>This model seems cheap and cuts out (freezes) when I use it.</li>
            <li>I had a great check up last week....</li>
            <li>It has a light to let you know when to recharge</li>
            <li>Really deep cleans, and works great.  </li>
            <li>Do these things, gargle with cheap H2O2 from the pharmacy (peroxide) and voila.</li>
            <li>And now the \\&quot;RECHARGE\\&quot; light blinks after every use.</li>
            <li>I called OralB and their automated information confirmed the info on the packaging, these two are not compatible.  </li>
            <li>I thought it malfunctioned because the light stayed off.</li>
            <li>I thought it malfunctioned because the light stayed off.</li>
            <li>Researched this Prof Care 1000 series and bought 2, for a total of @$90 which is a great deal.  </li>
            <li>It does a great job on my teeth without beating up my gums which I tended to do with a regular toothbrush.</li>
            <li>When we started using this model, we were blown away by how much more powerful it seems to be.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It works great, my mouth definitely feels cleaner than with a manual toothbrush.</li>
            <li>is a perfect option for an everyday brush to keep in your bag or for a travel brush.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>and that&#x27;s important.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll do a lot of cleaning in 2-3 minutes and that&#x27;s important.</li>
            <li>This toothbrush is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>It has lived up to my expectations and I enjoy using it.</li>
            <li>Fantastic product.</li>
            <li>and I am overall happy with it.</li>
            <li>The charging light flashes, so it&#x27;s all hooked up.</li>
            <li>All the heads fit well</li>
            <li>Since this has a lot of reviews and is no longer available, I won&#x27;t go on.</li>
            <li>the electric brush was so cheap.</li>
            <li>This is my third oral-B electric toothbrush and they all seem to be great.  </li>
            <li>Works great and gets the job done in a very short amount of time.</li>
            <li>smooth vibration</li>
            <li>If your spouse is a light sleeper, maybe this would be a problem?</li>
            <li>This is a great basic, no bells, no whistles electric tooth brush.  </li>
            <li>Stays charged about two weeks and is so much more powerful than others.</li>
            <li>, it is such a great product.</li>
            <li>The flashing recharge light is helpful to know when it is fully charged.  </li>
            <li>i think it was worth buying it :)</li>
            <li>and it is more fun to use this brush.</li>
            <li>A display showing the time brushed &amp; happy face at the two minute mark.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great product , very simple works well easy to clean</li>
            <li>This brush is worth every penny &amp; more.</li>
            <li>Yes, the induction system has no exposed contacts, looks \\&quot;neat\\&quot;, etc., but sacrifices efficient recharge time (maybe that&#x27;s why these are also available as 2-unit packs).</li>
            <li>Great especially for the price!</li>
            <li>This thing is fantastic.</li>
            <li>A light blinks to let you know when it&#x27;s charging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This one works great and makes my teeth feel like I just left the dentist.</li>
            <li>but I feel like it has made brushing my teeth so much more exciting.</li>
            <li>With the Oral-B, no matter which teeth you&#x27;re cleaning or whatever angle, the round brush is all over it and cleans perfectly.  </li>
            <li>I bought this product instead of a Sonicare one just because the price and the available promotion (rebate of 20 bucks).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received my order today.</li>
            <li>And with the rebate currently being offered, a great deal.</li>
            <li>It rattles, it vibrates like a jack hammer, it even sounds cheap and like it&#x27;s going to fall apart.</li>
            <li>Pay the money and forget the cheap.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t seem to by a snug fit.</li>
            <li>The two together equal, great oral care.</li>
            <li>A great thing about this is that it will tell you that it has low power already because of its blinking mechanism allowing you to charge it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>quicklyand is easy to clean</li>
            <li>the lamp light up as to recharge, adds a lot</li>
            <li>The charging light blinks while charging &amp; goes out when fully charged.</li>
            <li>My mouth feels much better after two weeks use, and compared to the cost of any dental work this is well worth the money.  </li>
            <li>I noticed that replacement heads are available in my grocery store.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s an absolutely *fantastic* toothbrush for the price.</li>
            <li>and it is itself easy to clean.</li>
            <li>Generic brush heads also work great with this brush.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much more powerful and I like the pulses the Oral-B does at 30-second intervals.</li>
            <li>great plus is the 30 second indicator.&lt;br /&gt;At</li>
            <li>This one seems easy to keep clean and hygenic.</li>
            <li>My manual brush felt insignificant in comparison, was happy to get back to using this brush.</li>
            <li>I am going to run a band of electrician&#x27;s tape around the handle to cover the light.  </li>
            <li>The oral-B Precision 1000 does a fabulous job cleaning my teeth.</li>
            <li>Replacement heads are readily available too.</li>
            <li>I like the fact that it stutters after 30 seconds, letting me know it is time to move on to another place in my mouth &amp; I like the light that lets me know it is time to recharge it.  </li>
            <li>and we replacement heads are available when needed.</li>
            <li>The oscillations are still very &amp;#34;tight&amp;#34;, and (obviously) the brush heads fit perfectly and snugly now</li>
            <li>This fit the bill</li>
            <li>I enjoy brushing my teeth with it.</li>
            <li>This model is more powerful and works with my  existing brush heads.</li>
            <li>I then bought one of the cheap rechargeable models, but never felt like it got my teeth as clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Have bought a couple different versions over the years and happy with all.</li>
            <li>This thing is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to keep clean.</li>
            <li>and aesthetics are important - you have to look at this and fit it in your bathroom</li>
            <li>The charge last for over a week, so traveling with this is great.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t bother buying this cheap version.</li>
            <li>Also the 30 second triggers are great to tell you when to switch quadrants.</li>
            <li>Fantastic product that my family will not go without again.</li>
            <li>Also, don&#x27;t buy cheap brush replacements.</li>
            <li>I also don&#x27;t care for that blinking light...</li>
            <li>It cleans your teeth and leaves them feeling smooth and looking polished.  </li>
            <li>I almost enjoy brushing, almost.</li>
            <li>This one is simple, easy to keep clean, and does a great job.  </li>
            <li>It took mine about 36 hours until the blinking light (showing that unit is charging) went off.</li>
            <li>I am still somewhat happy with the unit, but I will definitely keep this in mind when buying another electric toothbrush in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>heads available for purchase</li>
            <li>It works well and is comfortable to use.</li>
            <li>Biggest drawback is that there does not seem to be a travel case available.</li>
            <li>I wish it could just beep or have an LED light up or something.</li>
            <li>It actually works great if you&#x27;re in a hurry and can&#x27;t spare two minutes.  </li>
            <li>I liked this toothbrush so much that I bought another one for my wife.  </li>
            <li>I like the choice of replacement brush heads available for this model.</li>
            <li>This is a great basic electric rechargeable toothbrush.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;It has enough features to do a great job.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I have seen the light.</li>
            <li>but I knew when I ordered it no case was available.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have to recharge it as much and the sensor is a nice feature.</li>
            <li>You will want to take your time brushing and enjoy the ride.</li>
            <li>But when I floss afterwards, it&#x27;s amazing how much stuff still comes out from between the teeth.</li>
            <li>As far as I can tell, it is doing a good job.  </li>
            <li>The latest model OralB is quiet and does a good job of cleaning.  </li>
            <li>So far, so good.  </li>
            <li>I liked the old one &amp; I love this one also.</li>
            <li>but so far it&#x27;s good and</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall a good intro to mechanical powered brushes for me, though I might go for something a bit more fancy next time.</li>
            <li>so far so good.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>Cleans my teeth way better especially when my grip isn&#x27;t that good in the morning.</li>
            <li>Our teeth feel noticeably cleaner and we are able to use a much lighter touch than before while getting better results.</li>
            <li>the rotational/vibrational action from this model i thought would provide superior cleaning.</li>
            <li>love it, feel my mouth is super clean and fresh.&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li>so far so good.</li>
            <li>So far this is a good buy</li>
            <li>A relaxing way to do a good job of brushing, complete with timer to let one know when they have reached 2 minutes of brushing.  </li>
            <li>good for all cleaning purposes-- good for a narrow mouth</li>
            <li>Good for sensitive gums as well</li>
            <li>I liked my old Sonic Vitality better.  </li>
            <li>So far so good.  </li>
            <li>I was trying to replace the no-longer-made Oral B Sonic Complete (that I LOVED)</li>
            <li>So far, so good.</li>
            <li>It has some  advancements on the old one, and it&#x27;s just as good.</li>
            <li>Far superior tooth cleaning than the Sonicare</li>
            <li>So far so good.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Battery life isn&#x27;t as good as old NiCad models.</li>
            <li>Having an electric toothbrush is far superior to any manual toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I was happy to get a new electric toothbrush at first</li>
            <li>I find that I could spend more time brushing because it keeps your mind on what you are doing and doing it right.</li>
            <li>Please learn the right way to get the most of this Braun.</li>
            <li>The Amazon price was great and significantly lower than the price in local stores.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t take up much counter space at all, and vibrates powerfully for a good clean.  </li>
            <li>Also Amazon stayed true the their word of price matching and was very quick (&amp;lt;24hrs) to respond to my pricing challenge.</li>
            <li>Thanks!!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a very powerful product, I had brushes that cost twice that</li>
            <li>Very powerful.  </li>
            <li>a very powerful electrical toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;pro:&lt;br</li>
            <li>The battery life on this brush is very nice and I only charge it once every 3-4 days.</li>
            <li>It has 4 30 seconds segments - very useful.</li>
            <li>Seems very powerful.  </li>
            <li>Love the powerful, clean feeling after brushing.</li>
            <li>easy to clean and keep clean (though it is an every day maintenance thing).  </li>
            <li>keeps teeth clean like dentist does!!!&lt;br /&gt;good for gums and great current rebate!!!&lt;br</li>
            <li>Even the dentist made positive statements that the new brush was doing a great job.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been the best way to keep our teeth clean, removing previous staining, and reduce cavities!  </li>
            <li>Great price nice small stand.</li>
            <li>my dental checkups are always quick and easy - my dentist told me to keep doing whatever it is that I have been doing.</li>
            <li>Super easy to use.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super easy and it does stay charged for longer than a week.  </li>
            <li>Teeth have never been cleaner, and it&#x27;s quick and easy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used normal tooth brushes my entire life and this thing is awesome.</li>
            <li>My new favorite tooth brush!</li>
            <li>Good brush, though I found it a bit too powerful and not as smooth or comfortable as the Oral b junior sensitive electric brush.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It took quite a while to charge it up for the first time, so make sure you have something else available, just to play it safe on that first day.  </li>
            <li>I was able to obtain a replacement very reasonably on Amazon and had a $10 rebate from the company.</li>
            <li>but this one has the most needed features at a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li>So, when I needed a new brush, I reviewed the data on both the Phillips and the Oral B, and liked the sound of the Oral B reviews.  </li>
            <li>easily use and charge :) really motivate me to brush my teeth</li>
            <li>The heads are nice and small for kids&#x27; mouths and the built in timer is very handy.</li>
            <li>Bought this recently for my girl, it is very nice, battery charge indicator is a cool feature.</li>
            <li>I love my new Oral-b Pro Healthy Clean Precision 1000 rechargeable electric toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>and I love the new brush head that cups your teeth for an even better clean.</li>
            <li>And any electric brush is better than a manual when you consider how many more strokes it produces in the same amount of time.</li>
            <li>I forgot to mention it in my original review, but as \\&quot;icing on the cake\\&quot;,</li>
            <li>Have had one of the original units for a number of years.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth it!</li>
            <li>Well worth the upgrade price!  </li>
            <li>I have found that in addition to whitening teeth, the Oral B has significantly reduced the incidence of tooth decay and cavities.  </li>
            <li>and they now have the original receipt so you can&#x27;t check it or can&#x27;t return it without the UPC.</li>
            <li>Once the battery is full, the light stays off (which I like).  </li>
            <li>They sure are pretty.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d probably give it two stars for the toothbrush alone, but the one-star rating is because of the fact that the $15 rebate offer was declined, reportedly because the original UPC was not included.  </li>
            <li>My dentist originally suggested this</li>
            <li>Original battery for me was</li>
            <li>It is well worth the money!</li>
            <li>Good buy, no regrets.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just as powerful though!</li>
            <li>but I had the original Oral B version for years that I paid $100 for which seemed like a lot at the time</li>
            <li>So far, we are very pleased with it.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t need the higher cost models and much better than the Oral-B Vitality.</li>
            <li>but the details were in the packaging which I&#x27;m pretty sure I don&#x27;t have anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The small head is perfect to reach into all of the nooks and crannies of the mouth.</li>
            <li>This was more than I wanted to spend since I think the last one was about $20, but overall I am very happy.  </li>
            <li>The higher models move at twice the speed of this one and have a couple more settings, but then I thought,</li>
            <li>Having the unit with all my attachments just willy nilly on my counter, or even in a drawer, was driving me nuts, but I found a small bait-and-tackle type case at Daiso for $1.50 that fits everything perfectly</li>

            <li>How can I resend original barcodes that I already sent?  </li>
            <li>I opted for this one since it&#x27;d gotten slightly better reviews than the Sonicare, despite being a couple of bucks higher in price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with the Oral-B Professional Care 1000; meets all my expectations.  </li>
            <li>Small footprint and excellent cleaning.</li>
            <li>hope it continues to help him want to have fresh breath and teeth!</li>
            <li>and she&#x27;s very satisfied with it after nearly two months of use.</li>
            <li>So far I am very pleased with it.  </li>
            <li>I have recommended it to my two adult children and they are very pleased with it also.  </li>
            <li>My dentist recommended this toothbrush and I am not disappointed.  </li>
            <li>(since I, of course, no longer have the original UPC?)</li>
            <li>Because the customer has no recourse--they no longer have the original UPC.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t prove I ever sent an original UPC in to them now, can I?</li>
            <li>This is the first electric toothbrush I have used in more than 40 years, but it&#x27;s great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This was my first time using an electric toothbrush, so I might be biased...:) ...</li>
            <li>Ok, first the caveats.</li>
            <li>original Oral-B 40.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All</li>
            <li>It also seems to charge more quickly than the older model and performance stays better throughout the charing cycle.</li>
            <li>However this one is smaller, lighter, with more features and more enjoyable to use.  </li>
            <li>It took more than 24 hours to charge the first time, but shorter times since then.  </li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t found any models that are &amp;#34;family&amp;#34; friendly.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny!</li>
            <li>/&gt;German quality of the toothbrush head is most evident versus the Chinese-made knockoffs sold in stores like BJ&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>but when I plug this Braun toothbrush into the outlet, there is a large &amp;#34;charge&amp;#34; icon that lights up very bright blue.  </li>
            <li>You get a dental cleaning right at home, it makes your teeth feel so clean and shiny!</li>
            <li>My mouth always feels incredibly clean and fresh after using this, and I feel healthier too!</li>
            <li>My first Oral-B was a Vitality which I liked very much</li>
            <li>My wife said she just really liked this new toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>My teeth and mouth are so appreciative of the new oral hygiene care they are getting!&lt;br</li>
            <li>my teeth have an all new kind of clean feeling.</li>
            <li>This new one pulsates much more quickly and seems to do a better job of brushing.  </li>
            <li>After using this for about 2 weeks I notice that my teeth feel almost as clean as when I get a cleaning done at the dentist.  </li>
            <li>It seems to clean the teeth well, my dentist recommended this brand.</li>
            <li>Clean teeth.  </li>
            <li>Quieter and teeth feel squeaky clean.  </li>
            <li>All these from a brush head that looked perfectly clean on the outside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t imagine trying to clean my teeth</li>
            <li>I hear this sound from the bathroom &amp;#34;Wow, this one is so much faster, Love it!&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>Once clean, I remove the brush and run water over it and the tip of the brush holder, with the brush holder momentarily running.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried the pro white, precision clean, and dual clean brush heads, and I&#x27;m simply thrilled with each, though the dual clean head is my favorite.</li>
            <li>&quot; clean</li>
            <li>Teeth feel clean.</li>
            <li>The dental hygienist immediately said that it looked like I had gotten my teeth cleaned before coming to her to clean my teeth.</li>
            <li>/&gt;But this does come as a surprise and leaves me with the squeaky clean</li>
            <li>My teeth are squeaky clean when I&#x27;m done brushing.  </li>
            <li>I wanted to get one because I felt like my manual couldn&#x27;t get my teeth as clean as I wanted, and</li>
            <li>stars since they still clean teeth.</li>
            <li>Talk about perfectly clean.</li>
            <li>All you have to do to clean the unit is pull the head attachment off, rinse with water, and wipe clean with a towel or napkin.</li>
            <li>The Sonicare uses sonic technology by vibrating, so brushing is required when the unit is on or it won&#x27;t clean at all</li>

            <li>Thorough and easy to use, easy to clean, and the battery lasts a reasonable amount of time.</li>
            <li>A large upgrade from my Panasonic that I purchased many years ago.</li>
            <li>the difference!\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I felt special, ha ha.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>You have to buy the special flosser separate.</li>
            <li>Amazon offered a much better price than a large retailer, too.</li>
            <li>I bought it for my daughter to use with the special brush for braces.  </li>
            <li>It just doesn&#x27;t have and special attachments or anything.  </li>
            <li>He was right!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m certain this will be an excellent toothbrush, as it&#x27;s reviewed by independent sources very highly.  </li>
            <li>I love electric toothbrushes, they really get my teeth clean and shiny</li>
            <li>I have to say that this particular brush is more of the same....2 minute timer, battery life light</li>
            <li>This one is quieter, more comfortable, and easier to use than older models.</li>
            <li>Been using it for a few months now and seems to be doing a very good job.</li>
            <li>After several weeks of use I&#x27;ve been pretty happy with this brush.  </li>
            <li>First off, it felt surprisingly more powerful.</li>
            <li>The power is markedly better and the every 30 second reminder to move to the next quadrant of my teeth is nice to make sure that I am spending appropriate time on each area.</li>
            <li>It cleans my teeth well and is attractive while taking up minimal space on my sink.  </li>
            <li>Our dentist says there teeth look great and not nearly as much plaque.</li>
            <li>(it is more compact, so if I traveled for a long time, it would be nice to have around...</li>
            <li>I am extremely happy with this toothbrush and will be buying another for my significant other.</li>
            <li>The hype is true.  </li>
            <li>Nothing about it bothers me and my teeth feel super clean afterwards.</li>
            <li>I have found that the key to getting good performance is to replace the brush head often.  </li>
            <li>It replaces an Oral-B that I have had for many years, but had to be recharged every week, and did not have much power.&lt;br</li>
            <li>vibrate feature alerting you to switch sides or end your brushing is particularly cool.</li>
            <li>The action is effective but doesnt tear your gums up.</li>
            <li>However, spinning, thrusting, jerking, and whipping isn&#x27;t necessary to good teeth and gum healh.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t tell whether this is true or not without consulting a dentist.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t tell whether this is true or not without consulting a dentist.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had Oral-B Electric toothbrushes for 23 years and they keep my teeth white and my gums in good shape.  </li>
            <li>I can really notice that it is working way better than my manual toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I drive a 20 yr old car &amp; refuse to own a cell phone.  </li>
            <li>It began to lose the ability to hold a full charge and the power was also diminished.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good to have such a reliable product that I can rely on over the years.</li>
            <li>hope this product lasts a good 10 years like my last one!</li>
            <li>have liked it so far though.</li>
            <li>Multiple brush heads and sturdy construction makes this a good buy.</li>
            <li>I can tell from my rinses that this thing really works a lot better than manual toothbrushes.</li>
            <li>Unit seems well built, feels solid and of good quality materials.  </li>
            <li>the handle shows a full charge.  </li>
            <li>and it still takes 2-1/2 days on the charger to get a full charge.  </li>
            <li>cool.</li>
            <li>This brush does the job very well, and way cheaper than most.</li>
            <li>, it takes about a full day for it to charge.</li>
            <li>This is a basic brush and does a good job.</li>
            <li>Unit seems well built, feels solid and of good quality materials.</li>
            <li>It really does whiten and get at the plack better</li>
            <li>In my opinion, purchasing this Oral-B 1000 electric toothbrush is a good investment not only to get cleaner teeth but also to benefit from an efficient gum massage!</li>
            <li>It takes about a full day to charge it to the full but it will work almost immediately.</li>
            <li>It works well, have good reviews, and it does remove my plaque than my standard brush.</li>
            <li>It is a true value.</li>
            <li>I loved it then and this one is working just the same but with some improvements.  </li>
            <li>True, but I travel a lot</li>
            <li>you still have to floss), brush your tongue via tongue scraper 2x/day, and use your antimicrobial mouthwash for a full 30 seconds 2x/day.</li>
            <li>But a full battery lasts for 7 days of 2x/day brushing.  </li>
            <li>Eventually, I ordered the Oral-B 1000 as it seemed to offer a good value for the price based on various reviews.</li>
            <li>While this is not the top of the line unit, it does the basics very well.  </li>
            <li>get almost two weeks out of a full charge.</li>
            <li>After using this toothbrush my teeth feel super clean compared to using a manual toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s design to fit each individual tooth enables more flexibility in the style of your brushing, more like a dental instrument.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s design to fit each individual tooth enables more flexibility in the style of your brushing, more like a dental instrument.</li>
            <li>Also switches off if using too much pressure, although I haven&#x27;t been able to trip it yet into switching off yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oral</li>
            <li>I feel super clean after using this toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Relatively inexpensive but a good quality product that does the job well.</li>
            <li>This is a simple good replacement.  </li>
            <li>, we wore out the last pair and loved them too.</li>
            <li>nice mechanical design, feels like a professional tool.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Helps provide better cleaning at reasonable cost.</li>
            <li>Overall, it seems to do a good job of scrubbing my teeth and the bristles on the head</li>
            <li>won&#x27;t go off on why Oral-B should be more environmentally responsible... and should make this device&#x27;s battery upgrade-able..</li>
            <li>This does a good job and is very similar to the one my dentist uses.</li>
            <li>Good product, I switched to electric brush two months ago, and I can feel a big difference in my oral hygiene.</li>
            <li>good charger, comes with one extra head.</li>
            <li>It gets my teeth super clean.  </li>
            <li>Otherwise, it&#x27;s a good, basic toothbrush.</li>
            <li>but I can tell when it has full battery</li>
            <li>This Oral-B is still quite good (and to me, easier to handle than the Rotadent), even though I think I still feel a bit of plaque on the teeth at times after brushing (however, the dental appointment comment was that I&#x27;ve got one of the lowest plaque amounts on my teeth, and I only brush twice a day about 1/3 of the time).</li>
            <li>I love this toothbrush and my teeth feel so much healthier.</li>
            <li>good basic tooth brush.</li>
            <li>but it is really good compared to a regular toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So I think this is a good basic electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li>This is a good basic electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Also, this is a no extras on this model which is not bad as a toothbrush should not cost a lot of money.</li>
            <li>They both have two minute timers, but this new one lets me know when 30 seconds have passed, making brushing each quadrant very easy.  </li>
            <li>i like thie item very much because it&#x27;s really easy for me to use</li>
            <li>The new oner will seem much stronger as it will hold a good charge.</li>
            <li>It produces a difference right after the first use and lasts most of the day.  </li>
            <li>Holds a charge well, seems quite effective, but super loud.</li>
            <li>I guess this is a good thing, and luckily you have the ability to back off on the pressure you apply.</li>
            <li>The battery on my previous one died after many years of good use.</li>
            <li>I used a Rotadent for a year and a half, felt it was good, it wasn&#x27;t the latest model.</li>
            <li>Healthy White Power Toothbrush]] does a better job of getting my teeth clean and has three speed settings.</li>
            <li>the years, I have developed my own technique to keep the toothbrush fresh and clean.  </li>
            <li>The vibration is too strong that it hurt my gum the first time I used it.</li>
            <li>It is easy to set up and charge and not as bulky as i first thought</li>
            <li>(I think), but it cleans off pretty easily.</li>
            <li>I was expecting a simple effective toothbrush, without many bells and whisltles and that&#x27;s exactly what I got.</li>
            <li>I received a promotion because my boss thought my fresh smile would increase work productivity, which it has!  </li>
            <li>Both rechargeable models have the built-in &#x27;three big pauses&#x27; signal to let you know you have brushed for a full two minutes, however, I am re-thinking whether I need to follow the 2-minute recommendation every time I brush, since over-brushing is the greatest bane my teeth</li>
            <li>It is also great for travel due to it&#x27;s size.</li>
            <li>Cleans well and leaves my mouth feeling fresh and clean.  </li>
            <li>Its powerful, gets your teeth really  clean</li>
            <li>The product is recommended for those who take their dental care seriously and want an affordable electric toothbrush that works flawlessly.</li>
            <li>This smaller brush head also had a strong massaging action which felt great on my gums.</li>
            <li>The product I ordered worked fine, exactly as specified.</li>
            <li>It makes your teeth feel so clean and fresh.</li>
            <li>Easy to use, powerful, effective and takes no room on the countertop for the charger, since it is needed only once per week.  </li>
            <li>It is the most comfortable electric toothbrush I have used as it is no struggle to get around the back teeth.&lt;br /&gt;Light and easy to hold.  </li>
            <li>I recommend this toothbrush for anyone with braces because the head spins really quickly to get teeth even cleaner than manua brushing.</li>
            <li>It works noticeably better than my manual toothbrush, in particular with cleaning between my teeth.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This simple, one speed, auto stop with too much pressure is GREAT.  </li>
            <li>A quick rinse and a wipe</li>
            <li>Thanks to the great review by a person who actually made a video of the product I was sold.  </li>
            <li>I have owned an older version of it for years that I also love.</li>
            <li>When my super duper Oral B outfit bit the dust</li>
            <li>The author is truly bold in Christ.......</li>
            <li>well packed and a quick post</li>
            <li>so you know you are spending adequate time in each area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>And, it does take some effort to get it clean...not just a quick swipe.</li>
            <li>After using manual and expensive brushes for many years, I found this item to be the best in Dental Hygiene.</li>
            <li>Delivery was quick.</li>
            <li>Solid powerful motor, good brush.</li>
            <li>I paid more for the older model than I did this one</li>
            <li>The next best thing to going to your dental hygenist daily.  </li>
            <li>This model has given me the proper cleaning tool and my dental tech is more than pleased.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my third braun brush - and I must say they are just getting better and better.</li>
            <li>More to the point, my Braun coffee maker has been going strong for 5 years, which is more than I expected.  </li>
            <li>Also charges quickly.</li>
            <li>Charged quickly.</li>
            <li>These are way better than the older model that I had.</li>
            <li>Received it quickly and immediately started using.  </li>
            <li>It does an adequate job</li>
            <li>well made, easy to clean, very convenient.</li>
            <li>It came well protected and charged the battery quickly.</li>
            <li>But a bit too quick.</li>
            <li>Technically, it is still under warranty, but the shipping cost is on me, making it more worthwhile to just continue using the product as-is or buy a newer model.</li>
            <li>Quick delivery.</li>
            <li>I have a personal policy that when I get screwed over on a rebate, I do my best to not buy items from the same company again.</li>
            <li>I tend to brush too quickly, and this device helps me time</li>
            <li>So for anyone who wants a healthy set of teethes/gums (at the same time at great price) I would highly recommend in purchasing this today.</li>
            <li>I have used Oral-B electric toothbrushes for many years and highly reccommend them.&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE</li>
            <li>knew that Braun is highly recommended by dentists because it removes tartar and cleans better than manual brushes</li>
            <li>a great toothbrush and clean teeth are a worthwhile investment, I suggest you spend a little more now and save later</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just the right size to get to the back teeth and give them a good brushing.</li>
            <li>I Absolutely Love it so far!!</li>
            <li>Cleans  10 times better than my old Oral -B !!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Product itself is great, I like that it comes with a small charger so it can be stored easily</li>
            <li>The very first time I used this toothbrush</li>
            <li>Overall, very pleased.</li>
            <li>This is my first electric toothbrush and it is fantastic.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s only been a week, but so far, so good!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 36-years-old, and bought my very first electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li>The usual brilliant Amazon service.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li>So much higher power than the cheap electrics I grew up using.</li>
            <li>I liked the other model I had before better.</li>
            <li>had other mechanical tooth brushes but this one is by far the best and</li>
            <li>- the rotating heads really are more effective than standard brushing.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyway, this is a wonderful product that makes an annoying daily-plus chore downright enjoyable and keeps your teeth looking and chewing nicely.  </li>
            <li>Anyway, this is a wonderful product that makes an annoying daily-plus chore downright enjoyable and keeps your teeth looking and chewing nicely.  </li>
            <li>All expectations met with no unpleasant surprises.</li>
            <li>This toothbrush does a good job of cleaning however, it takes a long time (approx.</li>
            <li>Battery holds charge a good long time.</li>
            <li>It seems to clean teeth well, is easy to keep clean, takes up very little counter space and looks good.  </li>
            <li>So slim and comfortable to hold, this brush shape can really get into all the corners and clean the days plaque away.</li>
            <li>This is for the Oral-B Professional Healthy Clean Precision</li>
            <li>:B003UKM9CO Oral-B Professional Healthy Clean Precision 1000 Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush 1 Count]]</li>
            <li>Works great, but I don&#x27;t particularly care for the blinking lights when the battery is low.  </li>
            <li>After using it for only a week, I feel that my teeth are getting more thoroughly clean!</li>
            <li>I love my new toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Glad I got a new one.</li>
            <li>I love my new electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li>The new one is better, but not up to the published claims they make about time between charges.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love having a NEW electric toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>My wife and I love our new electric toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li>My old toothbrush died so I bought a new one exactly like the old one and am very happy with it.</li>
            <li>Previously we had been buying the disposable battery-operated brushes for them at the grocery store, but these were a great investment.</li>
            <li>What a great product!a half.  </li>
            <li>This tooth brush is definitely worth all $39 which is pretty cheap for an electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I can easily recommend this model, the Oral-B Precision 1000, to anybody who wants to use an electric toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>l like it very much!It&#x27;s easy to exchange and use.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t take much space on the counter, easy to use and handle is slim to hold.</li>
            <li>Works fine with strong action.</li>
            <li>very durable and easy to use.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never had an electric toothbrush before, but my dentist recommended I get one after my latest cleaning, reminding me that I needed to brush for 2 full minutes, because otherwise it simply isn&#x27;t effective, and that the electric softer can do a better job anyways while reminding us how long we&#x27;ve brushed.  </li>
            <li>Powerful when charged and charges quickly.</li>
            <li>easy to use and really made the switch from manual to electric toothbrush</li>
            <li>My first electric brush, good price, only one concern, after about 2 minutes it sounds as if it is going to stop but then keeps on trucking.</li>
            <li>Easy to operate and charges up very well.</li>
            <li>It cleans well, cleans up easily and is a much cheaper way to get the job done.</li>
            <li>You can just remove the head, but putting it on the shelf or counter isn&#x27;t a good solution, both for germs, and to allow the head to dry out between uses.  </li>
            <li>The flashing light is annoyingly bright and the battery seems to run down somewhat faster than the claimed 10 x 2 min brushings.</li>
            <li>Thanks Oral-B Professional Healthy Clean Precision 1000 Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush!</li>
            <li>The pulsations are very fast and gives you a squeaky clean.</li>
            <li>It does exactly what I intened it to do!</li>
            <li>And it was not expensive at all!</li>
            <li>Just be sure to brush 2x/day for 2 full minutes, floss at least 1x/day (no matter how good of a toothbrush you have</li>
            <li>As my first electronic toothbrush, I spent 2 hours researching consumer &amp; professional reviews, and I picked the &amp;#34;best&amp;#34; one - the one with the highest reviews and best features.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!!!</li>
            <li>This is my first electric toothbrush and I&#x27;ve been using it for months - no complaints!</li>
            <li>The charging lights which indicate status of charging &amp; low indicator are new &amp; welcome.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and does a much better job than regular tooth brush.</li>
            <li>I will definitely brush my teeth more often now that it&#x27;s so easy to do.</li>
            <li>i get the kids sized and make sure its super soft</li>
            <li>Works great, and the price was beyond amazing for the quality of this product, especially compared to other options!</li>
            <li>This is the first real electric tooth brush I&#x27;ve had (tried the cheap Crest Spin brush, but nothing on this level) and I did a lot of research ahead of time and decided the reviews and the price was the most reasonable with this brush.  </li>
            <li>Higher speed, more compact, and far superior to earlier versions of the Oral-B electric toothbrush that I have owned.</li>
            <li>Even if you shut it off right before the pause, when you press it on again, it quickly pauses again.</li>
            <li>Teeth feel clean (this is my first electric toothbrush).&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li>But other than that, I&#x27;m pretty happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li>But other than that, I&#x27;m pretty happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li>I used my Oral B for the first time today and my teeth felt clean and polished like I just came from the dentist.</li>
            <li>It is important to use for 2 minutes, but for the price the quality is great and my teeth are much cleaner with less plaque.</li>
            <li>Powerful little toothbrush, light, easy to hold, and really does a good job.</li>
            <li>This is a great little electric toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>Great little electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I did a little research online and Oral B 1000 looked like a great value for what I needed.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great little toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Does a great job with little effort.</li>
            <li>its a little loud- otherwise great!</li>
            <li>It also has a longer more traditional brush that I like better for tongue cleaning, and for getting into certain spaces between teeth.  </li>
            <li>It cleans very well and is comfortable to hold.</li>
            <li>The thing that I don&#x27;t like is that the recharging light flashes while charging and really catches your attention at night when you get up to use the bathroom.  </li>
            <li>Were this properly addressed, or their page amended to be accurate, I would gladly give this five stars.</li>
            <li>The charge lasts several days which is quite handy.  </li>
            <li>THEIR SMILE</li>
            <li>I think this toothbrush is a economical solution to having a cleaner mouth.</li>
            <li>and I simply didn&#x27;t feel like it was effectively cleaning my teeth.</li>
            <li>It has plenty of oomph and a solid, precise feel, better than some others I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>Well worth the cost.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised to find that it works just as well as the Sonicare, and even though I have my replacement, I&#x27;m still using the Braun most of the time.  </li>
            <li>They weigh about the same, but the Braun feels a bit more comfortable.  </li>
            <li>Much better than my old but trusty vitality.  </li>
            <li>My teeth feel fresh and envigorated after brushing.</li>
            <li>The 30 second timer feature is nice too.  </li>
            <li>brushing is fun for me now..</li>
            <li>but i think massages to the gums with its powerful vibration..</li>
            <li>was stunned at how \\&quot;fresh from the dentist\\</li>
            <li>When I read the instructions manual, it had pictures of a different kind of brush head holder, I did not receive either one.</li>
            <li>The price is reasonable and the functions are enough for a good cleaning.</li>
            <li>Much better than my old one.</li>
            <li>and I had $40 dollars worth of replacement brushes languishing in the drawer</li>
            <li>, I looked for an economical replacement.</li>
            <li>We purchased two at the time, so lost out on $30 worth of rebate.  </li>
            <li>It feels stronger, the 3D effect is more comfortable, along with the 30 second timer steps.</li>
            <li>Replacement heads are well worth the cost.</li>
            <li>The 30 second vibration marker is a nice way for the kids to keep track of time brushing.</li>
            <li>I am not crazy about the pulses every 30 seconds</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s far better than its rival.</li>
            <li>After using the Oral-b for a week I can honestly say it beats the Sonicare (the Elite/Essence model) in 2 key areas, its precision and the maintenance.</li>
            <li>They are definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li>and this brush gets into all the nooks and crannies and helps me to get that fresh feeling you have after visiting the dentist for a cleaning.</li>
            <li>If that happens, then I&#x27;ll have gotten my money&#x27;s worth from it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This one promises to be just as useful.  </li>
            <li>Have fun.</li>
            <li>What is nice is that the brush automatically vibrates extra every thirty (30) seconds, to let you know you should move to a knew place in your mouth.</li>
            <li>useful, but also kinda</li>
            <li>but for the effectiveness of the cleaning, i guess it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>Worth for the money you paid.</li>
            <li>better than the old one I had.  </li>
            <li>You just have to use a good 220V to 110V converter, try to use the heavy electric based converters as opposed to the light weight electronics based converters.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend them to anyone, They leave your teeth feeling nice and almost polished.  </li>
            <li>The cleaning action of this brush is much better.</li>
            <li>I think this was well worth the cost.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the Oral B products for years now, but this is an upgrade for me and so far I love it.</li>
            <li>I am pleased with my purchase so far.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a really useful product and all the dentists</li>
            <li>it worth 26 dollars.</li>
            <li>and I was causing both irritation and receding in a couple areas of my gums and a friend mentioned that her dentist said the rotary-action of these brushes can help correct that a bit - sure enough, I found I stopped making my gum sore every time I brushed, plus brushing was so much more enjoyable in general.&lt;br</li>
            <li>U will find it is totally worth it.</li>
            <li>I kind of wish I could deactivate this feature (especially since you can&#x27;t pause it to spit).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is a nice basic electric toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>I got this on sale for about $30 and it is well worth the purchase.</li>
            <li>, powerful, and holds its charge well.</li>
            <li>Much better than my old Sonicare</li>
            <li>But love it so far.</li>
            <li>I do think that my morning flossing goes easier since switching to the 1000, so I will confess that maybe the 1000 does better than my old manual brush has</li>
            <li>I bought it to replace my old Oral-B electric toothbrush which I bought for $20 many years ago.  </li>
            <li>i still have not nailed the art of brushing with this without drooling a bucket worth of saliva.</li>
            <li>The only thing I would have liked to have with this would have been a cover for the brush, to keep it cleaner.</li>
            <li>Even at Amazon&#x27;s price, the Oral-B is well worth the value.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s been outstanding so far.</li>
            <li>the model 1000 is worth the value compared to the 3000 or 5000.  </li>
            <li>I bought a package of Sensitive Heads and that alleviated the issue.</li>
            <li>Never thought an electric toothbrush would be worth the investment, but this has made me a convert.  </li>
            <li>It is simple and effective.  </li>
            <li>I bought this one for my 13 year old, I have had one for 3 years and absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>I bought the Oral-B Professional to replace an earlier model and it works great.</li>
            <li>Worth the money.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>The buy was totally worth it.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe this is such a popular product.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s verrry powerful.</li>
            <li>Well worth it.  </li>
            <li>nice product.&lt;br /&gt;would definitely recommend this to a friend.</li>
            <li>but my old manual does a much better job in between.</li>
            <li>they both think they are fun to use and</li>
            <li>Two features make it much better than my old one.  </li>
            <li>and then if i feel like its worth it, i will consider the investment in sonicare.</li>
            <li>Powerful without being abrasive.</li>
            <li>Big nice, should be improvement...</li>
            <li>(My wife charges more frequently, and her&#x27;s is just</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li>I heard this is useful for beginners -</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money and does a far better job than manually brushing your tech.</li>
            <li>unit has a timer to make brushing fun.</li>
            <li>Worth the cost.</li>
            <li>But we&#x27;ll worth every dollar.</li>
            <li>It is proving to be worth the cost.</li>
            <li>but i dont think it would be worth it</li>
            <li>I was so happy to find this item at such a reasonable price as I&#x27;ve seen them in stores for 3 times as much.  </li>
            <li>I love this Professional line, rechargeable toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I bought the brushes for sensitive gums and am glad I did.  </li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money for improved gum health.</li>
            <li>The old buttons where better in terms of size and feel.</li>
            <li>This is a powerful toothbrush</li>
            <li>so it was totally worth it.</li>
            <li>Says her smile looks brighter and her teeth feel cleaner.</li>
            <li>although honestly I&#x27;ve stopped heading the suggestions and give myself a pat on the back if i even make it to the 2 minute 4x &#x27;job</li>
            <li>So far it works OK.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been able to find the floss action replacement heads in the stores.</li>
            <li>Has a powerful motor and leaves teeth with the just-cleaned feeling you get from a trip to the dentist.</li>
            <li>I have no idea, as the brush seemed to be powerful.</li>
            <li>so worth the money.</li>
            <li>Good purchase product as a expected</li>
            <li>This my favorite electric toothbrush so far.</li>
            <li>A good buy and reliable product that does what is expected.</li>
            <li>I pushed the brush head against my thumb with some considerable force, much more than any sane person would do when brushing and couldn&#x27;t get it to disengage.&lt;br /&gt;-\\&quot;stutters\\</li>
            <li>Smile is brighter and gums feel like they are in a healthier condition.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not really crazy about this one.  </li>
            <li>Performs as advertised well worth the  price.</li>
            <li>and I am able to use my old wall mounted charger.  </li>
            <li>I did a lot of research before deciding on the Oral-B Professional Care 1000 and I love my purchase.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely better and faster than my manual brush, easier on my gums, and the small brush head more easily reaches hard-to-reach spots.  </li>
            <li>It is very powerful and cleans my teeth very well.&lt;br /&gt;Would</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s a pretty reasonable number but unless I&#x27;m very lucky, it won&#x27;t take</li>
            <li>The Clean Precision line offers higher end models with more features, but this unit is exactly what I was looking for with features and price.  </li>
            <li>The brushing action is different but very effective and my teeth feel even cleaner than before.  </li>
            <li>After using this religiously gums are so clean and healthy, rarely any sensitivity or redness anymore.</li>
            <li>This is my second oral b toothbrush purchase, the first one I bought more than 12 YEARS ago!</li>
            <li>So, I bought one and love it better than my other electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I went with the Oral B Pro 1000 since its brush head looked like the best choice for me due to still having all my wisdom teeth and the need to get back to those teeth.</li>
            <li>The toothbrush has a powerful clean and gives vibration feedback every 30 seconds before a larger more prolonged vibration at 2 minutes to remind you that it is time to stop.</li>
            <li>Quick to ship and items are exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>I bought this toothbrush for replacement to my 12 year old Braun / Oral B electric toothbrush who was still working fine until my girlfriend drop it on the floor! ;)</li>
            <li>My Dentist finally convince to switch to an Oral-B to protect and clean my teeth better.</li>
            <li>Really the main reason I didn&#x27;t get the sonic care is because I was charged tax and it was $5 more....</li>
            <li>Not only does it clean your teeth much better than a manual toothbrush, but it cleans without hurting your gums.</li>
            <li>i really like this because it has a lot more rpm as compared to my older electric tooth brush which i retired after 8 years in service</li>
            <li>All in all, a fine product that I&#x27;d highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I bought this Electric Toothbrush for my wife and so far she have not complaint so it is great so far.</li>
            <li>The battery is good for about a week worth of brushing twice a day although I have only let it die out once, I normally keep it on the charger when I&#x27;m not using it.</li>
            <li>I had to lean way over the sink and just let the drool roll other wise</li>
            <li>Other then that it&#x27;s a Good brush.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used manual toothbrushes all my life and was never interested in electric toothbrushes, despite me taking good care of my teeth.</li>
            <li>This unit is loud and kind of feels like a small jackhammer but seems to do a good job.</li>
            <li>He is now admitting this new electric toothbrush is doing &amp;#34;a much better job than my old regular toothbrush.&amp;#34; &#x27;Twas a good purchase.</li>
            <li>but this new one is 1/4 of cost of my old one and does the better job!</li>
            <li>High qualiity and good features like the 30 second beep and the 2 minute beep.  </li>
            <li>Makes brushing teeth so much more enjoyable compared to conventional brushes.</li>
            <li>the price is right.</li>
            <li>The reasons I think I made the right choice are as follows.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t the right toothbrush for me.</li>
            <li>The size is just right</li>
            <li>I had to see a periodontist for an issue, and she noticed the difference before and after this toothbrush right away.</li>
            <li>It has just the right heads and is rechargeable.</li>
            <li>right by hand.  </li>
            <li>Who in their right mind would....</li>
            <li>Who in their right mind would....</li>
            <li>Therefore the price is right.  </li>
            <li>After you brush, you can feel your teeth surface feel just right after ur dentist visit.</li>
            <li>Now I know to plug it in right away when it signals.</li>
            <li>you have sore gums or something you might want to use caution and investigate whether this is the right brush for you.&lt;br</li>
            <li>you always spend the right amount of time doing what needs to be done.</li>
            <li>I am brushing the right way.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t assume you&#x27;ll get the rebate because you jumped through all the right hoops and sent in the right stuff.</li>
            <li>With the rebate, it cost $40.00, right up my alley.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Hubby was right again.[[ASIN</li>
            <li>Does the job, yet the price is right.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s right.  </li>
            <li>After reading the reviews this brush was the right choice.</li>
            <li>I am going to call Oral B and see if they will make it right.</li>
            <li>one feature, one can live without easily;</li>
            <li>Easy to hear/feel reminders to move to new area.  </li>
            <li>It cleans significantly better than manual, but is pretty loud.</li>
            <li>The speed of the toothbrush is so fast I don&#x27;t know how it can possibly clean in between my teeth and gums.</li>
            <li>I like the timer, which my older one lacked, and I like the way the light blinks as it is charging and stops when it is charged.  </li>
            <li>When used properly (for the full duration and following the prompts) you get a clean superior to a manual and to a battery-powered manual electric (like Oral-B Pulsar, Crest Spinbrush, etc).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was looking for something better since my 12yr old oral b spinbrush was getting seasoned.</li>
            <li>It has a fast speed, and seems to get her teeth really clean.  </li>
            <li>Unlike some weaker brushes, I can feel that this is really getting my teeth clean.  </li>
            <li>Gets his teeth clean without much effort.</li>
            <li>Have tried MANY types of toothbrushes to encourage a seven-year-old boy to brush his teeth longer than 3 seconds, and he actually likes this one and goes the full two minutes.  </li>
            <li>It seems to clean the surfaces very well.</li>
            <li>The price was lower then shopping locally and with the rebate, it was a very easy decision.</li>
            <li>The 7000 had a nice smooth vibration and was at the correct vibration speed to allow the brush to get down in between your teeth and their crevasses.</li>
            <li>This would be great for those people with sensitive gums who need to slowly work up to something more powerful, but for those of you who already owned an electric toothbrush I would get one</li>
            <li>i can feel a huge difference vs a regular toothbrush, much better then the battery operated oral b basic model for $ 7.99 in most drugstores.</li>
            <li>I believe that the slower speed is for more sensitive teeth/gums, but the \\&quot;normal\\&quot; speed has been fine for me - and I have sensitive teeth and gums.  </li>
            <li>My new dentist recommended this for me and, while I&#x27;ll was very hesitant to switch to an automatic brush, I&#x27;m so glad I did.  </li>
            <li>Very smart purchase.</li>
            <li>so I will try and stick with it, but it&#x27;s definitely worth it to splurge a little more for a better model.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Great clean white healthy happy teeth are the final analysis, bottom line, end result, and sum total of reading and heeding the previous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Off</li>
            <li>Oral B tooth brush is light weight easy to charge I was using a regular toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>This one is more compact and takes less room (the stand) on the sink - I love it.</li>
            <li>Be a bit careful about using baking soda or toothpastes with strong abrasives if you are an &#x27;over-brusher&#x27; which can cause even more worn enamel.  </li>
            <li>Otherwise, we really like how quickly it charges and that it does 30 second timers to make sure all four quadrants of the mouth, outlined in the included instruction manual, get a full 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve heard the floss action is even better so its possible this brush may be even better than this.</li>
            <li>As usual Oral-B makes a great electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li>While they are most definitely better than any standard toothbrush, I find that I miss my old Sonicare.</li>
            <li>The head that comes with the toothbrush works ok, but I suggest you buy the &amp;#34;Prowhite&amp;#34; heads as they are far and away better than the generic head.</li>
            <li>My healthy  white smile is worth the price, plus the fact that it&#x27;s rechargeable.</li>
            <li>This is a great toothbrush for a small amount of money.  </li>
            <li>Works as advertised, I have been using it for past 3 weeks works great, I like it and would recommend it.</li>
            <li>Amazon had by far the best price--I had looked in several local stores.</li>
            <li>a small amount of toothpaste does a great job.</li>
            <li>I am very happy with it, replacing a ten- year old one hat finally died.</li>
            <li>It is also important to find a good hygienist who is serious about cleaning out the pockets, and doesn&#x27;t just give you a quick rush job with a cavitron.</li>
            <li>I was really hoping to take before and after pictures to see how effective this toothbrush was, but after a busy week I can already tell they are much whiter than they were before.</li>
            <li>Pro Health (battery operated, which is a real pain to open and change out batteries) which is made in China.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Spinning at much higher RPM than my traveling one, I cant wait to have dental checkup to see if this thing (which cost just a tad more than Pro Health) really cleans better</li>
            <li>The charge lasts a long time, and it cleans effectively.</li>
            <li>Oral-B Professional Healthy Clean Precision was more than expected.</li>
            <li>It still offers the power to do a good cleaning but now is much quieter and has new features that make it a better product, such as the charge indicator built into the handle.  </li>
            <li>Spending more money will not necessarily clean your teeth better, in my experience.  </li>
            <li>I have always loved the Oral-B brand and once again, they did not let me down.</li>
            <li>I use it to brush my teeth, up and down, side to side, and it does a good job.</li>
            <li>The brushing is very smooth, leaves a nice clean feeling, and I have not experienced any gum bleeding.</li>
            <li>This is not the Oral B Tooth brush i own, and ait certainly meets my expectations, Battery last about a week between charges.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The reason the 1000 was not as effective is because it comes with a standard head instead of the floss head like the smart series.</li>
            <li>of my friends use electrical and I always wondering why people like certain kind of brush.&lt;br /&gt;It turns out after I finally got one.</li>
            <li>I would invest a little more to get the better model.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The little charging light is also a nice touch.</li>
            <li>For example, I wish the handle was a little thicker just so it could fit nicely into my hand.</li>
            <li>Spend a little more and buy something better.  </li>
            <li>I think the OLD Rotadent is the the best electric toothbrush that I have owned, but the new Rotadents keep getting reviews that they&#x27;ll break down within a year, so that&#x27;s not a solution.</li>
            <li>This brush has a light pause built into it to let you know you are brushing too hard - probably a good thing for those of us</li>
            <li>I was happy with the price compared to other places, and the product seems solid, the brush head is comfortable and cleans well.</li>
            <li>The second thing is that this wonderful small footprint charger get very hot.</li>
            <li>The new one makes a huge difference</li>
            <li>now my new &amp;#34;Dental Friend&amp;#34; (this Product) is within easy reach and safe above the Lavatory Sink.</li>
            <li>The brush wheel oscillates quite a bit faster than it did on my older unit, making my teeth feel really clean.  </li>
            <li>Amazon sells a lot of replacement heads that fit this brush (and there are several kinds of heads that fit).  </li>
            <li>It is doing a great job cleaning my teeth and is a big improvement over my prior electrical toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>Ours is three years old and going strong</li>
            <li>I really felt the round rotating brush head is a joy to</li>
            <li>electric toothbrush is more powerfull than the old one, I&#x27;m really amazed by the head pulsing</li>
            <li>but the quality is not as good as my previous one I got from costco, which I did not find online.</li>
            <li>I recently purchased the Oral-B Professional Care 1000 Electric Rechargeable Power toothbrush and am totally delighted with it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;-I had no issues with initial gum bleeding and am happy with the results of brushing with the 1000 compared to my earlier manual brushing.</li>
            <li>This thing is like a ferret on meth (in a good way, of course) and left my mouth feeling way fresher and cleaner than did my old brush.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li>The round heads are more maneuverable than the conventionally-shaped heads on the Sonic Care and, for me, do a better job cleaning my teeth.</li>
            <li>Came super fast too.</li>
            <li>Great item, use it everyday and really like it.</li>
            <li>No complaints, price was good, it&#x27;s quieter than a previous Oral B brush I had</li>
            <li>Head rotates super fast.  </li>
            <li>(connector at head attachment developed a crack, still works but has a buzz and not as strong brushing).</li>
            <li>There are cheap generic brush head replacements available.</li>
            <li>Most likely is the battery that is has reached the end of its useful life time and the battery cannot be replaced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>worked great never going back to a regular tooth brush</li>
            <li>It makes my teeth feel extra clean and is easy to use.</li>
            <li>This unit has a battery that will last a week w/o charging when brushing twice/day and then the battery low indicator will come on, a great feature.</li>
            <li>Minor downside: when charging, a green light on the handle flashes very brightly.  </li>
            <li>This is far superior to the lower end electronic toothbrushes and the easy to use plug in charging station keeps this running 7 days or longer on one charge, and there are NO batteries to mess with.  </li>
            <li>I like the high speed of the brush and seems to clean well.</li>
            <li>I bought it for my 10 year old son who has problems with brushing long enough; so this was perfect since it has a timer that allows it to brush for 2 minutes!  </li>
            <li>However I liked the first one so much that I purchased this second one.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It is everything that I expected and more!</li>
            <li>I like it very much, it does its job</li>
            <li>Very fast, efficient cleaning teeth.</li>
            <li>I like this product very much.  </li>
            <li>The cost of electric toothbrush was very reasonable.</li>
            <li>This was just what I needed thank you very much</li>
            <li>It never was very fast.</li>
            <li>and I like it very much.  </li>
            <li>The strong motor and small head just works so much better than most other brand of electric toothbrushes and infinitely more cleaner than using a manual brush.</li>
            <li>This cheap model will only hold its charge for about 3 brushing sessions before you notice a significant performance decrease and the unit would need to be fully recharged.  </li>
            <li>I appreciate that it is relatively cheap compared to most of the other options</li>
            <li>So far the toothbrush has been fine.  </li>
            <li>Coffee + teas w/ fruits (especially the blueberry) had resulted in significant staining of these older teeth, requiring significant efforts by the hygienist to clean them up.</li>
            <li>This is a good product to pack when traveling...takes up little space...</li>
            <li>Good product, heads last about as long as the original ones.</li>
            <li>\\&quot;just went to the dentist\\&quot; clean, smooth feeling if properly used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I am always left with a smooth, clean finish.</li>
            <li>Powerful spinning action makes teeth feel really clean.  </li>
            <li>Mouth always feels clean and refreshed and the price was much better than expected.</li>
            <li>I actually liked an older brush head that just recently you can&#x27;t seem to get anymore</li>
            <li>It reaches to the back teeth, gets into tight corners, and is able to give a good scrub in every dental nook and cranny.</li>
            <li>Maybe my unit is defective or maybe I don&#x27;t know what to expect, but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve experienced an alert from my 1000 when pressing too hard.  </li>
            <li>Great toothbrush but hard to find replacement heads.</li>
            <li>It stutters too when you&#x27;re brushing too hard, which is a welcome feature that I didn&#x27;t have before.</li>
            <li>After using 2 great expensive toothbrushes for 10 years (recommended by my orthodontist), I was quite hesitent to try my husband&#x27;s suggestion and purchase an &#x27;Oral-B Professional Healthy Clean Precision 1000 Rechargeable Electric&#x27; when mine died.  </li>
            <li>this new model makes a noticeable improvement in how clean my teeth feel.</li>
            <li>It seems to get my teeth (and my 2 removable bridges) much cleaner than the old one and is one I would highly recommend because it has a lot more power than the old one and does such a good job.</li>
            <li>My oral hygenist noticed a huge difference when we had to get rid of our old Oral B.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This unit is loud and has a huge amount of vibration.  </li>
            <li>Seems fine, but the brush doesn&#x27;t do nearly as many RPMs as previous toothbrushes that we&#x27;ve owned.  </li>
            <li>Thanks, Amazon!</li>
            <li>My first electric tooth brush, no problems with it yet.</li>
            <li>My first electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li>It was damaged during the first charging.</li>
            <li>The first thing they told me to do was get an Oral-B rechargeable toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>replacing the one i have had since they first came out</li>
            <li>so  just ordering the same product  many many  years later.</li>
            <li>Works ok but battery life pretty short.</li>
            <li>but I actually look forward to brushing my teeth with this :-)</li>
            <li>kind of brush is a lot more expensive than a manual brush, of course, and replacement brush heads aren&#x27;t cheap either.  </li>
            <li>works exactly as advertized</li>
            <li>first change is that brushing with the Oral-b PC 1000 is counterintuitive: the brush does all the work.</li>
            <li>This provides a different and much more thorough cleaning than the one that manual toothbrushes</li>
            <li>Not too loud - a humming sound is all that you hear</li>
            <li>a Braun or and Oral B - the Oral B 1000 is a top choice for a moderately priced electric toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Our teeth feel much cleaner since using them!</li>
            <li>This is my second electric toothbrush and I can say its significantly better than my first.</li>
            <li>Replacement heads are sold everywhere and are not expensive..</li>
            <li>though I don&#x27;t have anything to compare it with since I am a first time user.  </li>
            <li>and i&#x27;m sure my dentist will notice a difference on my next visit.  </li>
            <li>I researched a lot of different options before ordering my first electric toothbrush, and I&#x27;m glad I went with this product.</li>
            <li>Pretty convenient for them</li>
            <li>The first one is a 3D Excel that I&#x27;ve used for over five years.  </li>
            <li>but I need to get more brushes because it only comes with one.</li>
            <li>Should buy higher models</li>
            <li>The first one I bought 3 years ago.  </li>
            <li>The only issue I had is not being able to use the manufacturer&#x27;s rebate because it was not purchased from a retail store and receipts from Amazon would not be honored.  </li>
            <li>Saved me twice when my wife left the gas on our stove top on.</li>
            <li>This is important to me since I have a lot of fillings and sensitive gums</li>
            <li>will use a regular toothbrush on occasion if a tooth is hurting me or if it feels like the tooth needs more cleaning.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what we wanted.</li>
            <li>My dentist, who had recommended the Oral-B toothbrush in the first place, diagnosed the Oral-B electric toothbrush as being to blame for taking the enamel off my teeth.</li>
            <li>I then turned to the box for a closer reading of exactly what the 1000 series could do.</li>
            <li>there are different models, some with more options than others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>there are different models, some with more options than others.     </li>
            <li>But I guess it cleans better than a regular toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Your teeth will feel so much healthier!</li>
            <li>this slow cooker works great.  </li>
            <li>Since I have been using Oral B electric toothbrushes for several years now, my dental checkups have been much better.  </li>
            <li>This is my first electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I would give the Phillips a try next time, as I am not in love with the cleaning I get from the Oral-B ones.</li>
            <li>, it says it may make your gums bleed at first...</li>
            <li>I would recommend this tooth brush over a manual toothbrush as it definitely does a better job.</li>
            <li>I had many of the brush heads left</li>
            <li>I feel the electric toothbrush cleans my teeth much better than standard brushing.  </li>
            <li>Without that, I&#x27;m sure my brushing would only take me about 80</li>
            <li>I have always been big on dental care and brush my teeth more than 2x a day and was glad when I received this as a christmas present!</li>
            <li>I also love how it oscillates and the 2-minute timer on it with 30-second reminders to move to a different area of my mouth.</li>
            <li>This is my first electronic toothbrush</li>
            <li>She also said my gums were in much better shape, so it definitely works!</li>
            <li>Works exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll have to admit this is my first Oral-b ever since I started using an electric toothbrush</li>
            <li>Works very well around braces, too!</li>
            <li>the same brush is being sold for 70 or more at retail</li>
            <li>I bought this one to replace the first one that my son broke.</li>
            <li>We have used Oral-B rechargeable toothbrushes for several years and are quite satisfied with them.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t feel it accomplishes any more than the basic brush heads.</li>
            <li>this is my first electric toothbrush</li>
            <li>Otherwise, it does exactly what it should.</li>
            <li>Love the battery indicator lights and the 30 second notifications to switch sides.</li>
            <li>the charging time will last for more than a week, almost two weeks.  </li>
            <li>The $30 price is great, considering it can last for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>would recommend it to anyone that is interested in Dental hygiene.</li>
            <li>I feel like it cleans my teeth quite a bit better than a standard toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I also love the 30 second timer: it helps me budget my time and brush my teeth evenly.</li>
            <li>It feels like it is doing a much better job than a regular tooth brush.</li>
            <li>I was looking at this and some sonic brushes that were double the price, and I&#x27;m definitely glad I went with this brush.</li>
            <li>I bought another Oral-B because I was so satisfied with my prior unit.  </li>
            <li>This toothbrush cleans my teeth better than my last oral.</li>
            <li>The toothbrush is a quality Oral-B product as to say it&#x27;s feels top notch and should last years.</li>
            <li>This is exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li>was blown away on first use as the power was twice that of the Vitality series.</li>
            <li>Battery does not hold enough charge for more than one use before having to recharge.</li>
            <li>no way to avoid this really!</li>
            <li>for fitting smaller mouths.&lt;br /&gt;Charging is easy.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, when I got an Oral-B 1000 Pro Care Electric Toothbrush, the differences were very noticeable!</li>
            <li>When I went to the dentist recently after not having gone for over twenty years, they seemed to think my teeth were in outstanding shape, except for the fact that I was over-brushing.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This was my first experience with an electric toothbrush - and I purchased it as a suggestion from my dentist.  </li>
            <li>I found it to be better than just brushing with a regular toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>, I really like this brush!</li>
            <li>Exactly as advertised</li>
            <li>I love that it has the ability to let you know when you&#x27;ve brushed in each area of your mouth for the recommended amount of time.</li>
            <li>I am not even able to contact this manufacturer to complain about the short life of this product.  </li>
            <li>This is my first electric toothbrush</li>
            <li>It is our first time using an electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li>It had been 5 years since I had bought my first Oral B Electric toothbrush</li>
            <li>I regret not buying one when they first came on the market,I would have saved thousands of dollars in dental bills.</li>
            <li>First time I used this brush was like murdering my teeth with mega vibrations.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have all the bells and whistles of the higher end models, but it cleans your teeth just as well in my opinion.  </li>
            <li>My last one was much better.</li>
            <li>My first electric tooth brush and all I can say is it does the job</li>
            <li>Not too many frills, and not too basic.</li>
            <li>A charge lasts about a week, used twice a day, consistent w/ the informational pamphlet.</li>
            <li>I know from the manual that that may go away after continued usage, but I just wasn&#x27;t willing to wait on it.</li>
            <li>I am sure it will help if she uses it regularly.</li>
            <li>You really won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
            <li>These two qualities makes it better for deep cleaning.  </li>
            <li>Exactly as I was hoping.</li>
            <li>I wanted something affordable That work because most Electric toothbrushes cost a arm and a leg came a cross this one.</li>
            <li>First, the package was already opened.</li>
            <li>I have bought many stuffs from Amazon and it&#x27;s the first time I received a product in such an opened package.</li>
            <li>Second, and more suspiciously, the toothbrush gets no energy at all, which in my experience is abnormal for a rechargeable electric product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>On my first day, my first thought was that it was scary-percussive.</li>
            <li>Especially since I got everything so cheap!</li>
            <li>I did have a problem with the first one I ordered.  </li>
            <li>I was looking for a quality toothbrush that was not too expensive and the Oral-B toothbrush was a perfect match.  </li>
            <li>However, I was able to buy this from my local chain drugstore for $15.00 cheaper.</li>
            <li>Check locally first on this item.</li>
            <li>This is a replacement for an Oral-B that finally died after many years of service.  </li>
            <li>My dentist will be pleased with my next check up.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Oral-B toothbrushes for several years and love how they work.</li>
            <li>To be honest, most of the time on my 5000 I just use the regular speed, so there&#x27;s no real loss of functionality with the 1000 model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li>As is true with most Oral B electric brushes you can use a wide varietiy of brush heads to suit your needs.</li>
            <li>I love the 30 second interval reminders.</li>
            <li>and I love it for the gums especially.</li>
            <li>On top of that, I went back to my Dentist and they didnt have to srap</li>
            <li>It is easy to use, even for the whole family and so simple to clean.</li>
            <li>Thanks to Oral-B!</li>
            <li>Charges fast!</li>
            <li>My first Oral-B was purchased in 2001, a Plaque Remover 3-D.</li>
            <li>I really can feel the difference!</li>
            <li>B brushes are great because the replacement brushes tend to be cheaper than the Sonicare counterparts thereby being cheaper in the long run as well as the initial buy.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It will feel funny at first.  </li>
            <li>I first started looking at the product it was about $39 dollars.</li>
            <li>So I bought it just in case it went higher</li>
            <li>A full charge lasts about 9 days before the light goes red to let you know to charge it.</li>
            <li>Exactly as described.  </li>
            <li>I tend to find the Philips sonicare cleans the most similar.</li>
            <li>I really do hope this wasn&#x27;t it!  </li>
            <li>This is the only model I&#x27;ve used, but I&#x27;m glad it&#x27;s the one I bought.</li>
            <li>It works better than a regular toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>This is my first electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Takes a while to charge it the first time.</li>
            <li>They really are brushing!  </li>
            <li>It is my first electric toothbrush</li>
            <li>My first electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li>After reading multiple reviews on all the many electric toothbrushes out there, I chose this one for my husband and me.</li>
            <li>I went to my orthodontist for the first time after two months of owning this</li>
            <li>If something comes up in the future, I&#x27;ll be sure to update my review.</li>
            <li>This is the first electric toothbrush that I have ever used.</li>
            <li>If it lasts as long as my last Oral/Braun, great.  </li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s not my first Oral-B electric toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>This is my first electric toothbrush ever.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this, don&#x27;t spend more $ on a SonicCare.</li>
            <li>This is the first electric toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li>it takes quite awhile (up to 22 hours) for the first charge.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, after my research, I decided this brush offered the best value without going overboard on silly features.  </li>
            <li>Then I found out my wife had ordered the twin pack for $50..a better deal and double the pulses per minute from this one.</li>
            <li>well truthfully, i bought this because i didnt want to drop double the $ on sonicare--</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used battery powered brushes before, but my dentist said an electric brush was better.</li>
            <li>Fits in your mouth much better than the rectangular head of a regular toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had oral B toothbrushes before and they were of much higher quality.</li>
            <li>I used to have a higher model but decided to try the this model.</li>
            <li>This one doesn&#x27;t vibrate compared to the higher level model....</li>
            <li>Not much to go wrong.</li>
            <li>In short, it has its minor flaws, but so far I&#x27;m satisfied that I got a good toothbrush for the price.</li>
            <li>But this product is pre-destined to be discarded after a couple/three years, so why pretend it needs more build quality than is necessary for a throw-away consumer item?</li>
            <li>And I already mentioned that the fancy features of the higher end models make no sense to me.&lt;br</li>
            <li>So glad that it had an alternate brush head for her to use.  </li>
            <li>My wife and I like this brush much better than the Sonicare E-series that we used for several years.  </li>
            <li>I also found the settings to be comfortable on my teeth ( I do not have sensitive teeth) .</li>
            <li>-I can&#x27;t be the only one in the house with sexy teeth.</li>
            <li>Overall I am pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li>It works okay, but the charge only lasts a week--instead of the three weeks</li>
            <li>He has braces and this stands up pretty well to the hardware.</li>
            <li>Seems to operate at higher speed than model it replaced.  </li>
            <li>But, I did have the first electric brush for 4 years.</li>
            <li>I am sure I was not the only one who got fooled.</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>After 5 years the battery in the first one decided it was time to retire.  </li>
            <li>Product is exactly as shown.</li>
            <li>This is my first electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li>My checkups at the dentist prove it works better than regular brushing.</li>
            <li>if you use this for more than one person, upgrade to the next model.  </li>
            <li>After using it just 3 times, I noticed that my teeth really FEEL cleaner!  </li>
            <li>First, I would like to say that the stand in the picture is not the stand you receive.</li>
            <li>make sure you have a 110v outlet (for international buyers)</li>
            <li>It comes with a simple stand recharger that fits in the corner of the counter top.  </li>
            <li>It is leagues better than using a standard toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I love the timer that alerts you every 30 seconds, it keep me from brushing the same spot when I am daydreaming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Exactly as described and delivery was prompt.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I am using an electric toothbrush</li>
            <li>my first electronic toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>It is my second Oral-B,even better than my first.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re pretty consistent in quality.</li>
            <li>The price of the brushes is another win for Oral-B...at least $4 cheaper than Sonicare per brush.  </li>
            <li>This is my first electric toothbrush</li>
            <li>I concur with most of the reviews I found, about no need for any further bells and whistles.</li>
            <li>The nearest retail stores have this same brush for $20 more.  </li>
            <li>The first time I went to my dentist, I hadn&#x27;t been to one in well over a year.</li>
            <li>We purchased two of these, and from the first use on, both would start and stop.</li>
            <li>This is my first electric toothbrush</li>
            <li>The one drawback will be the higher price for replacement spinning heads.</li>
            <li>So, I don&#x27;t know how many years the battery will last, before I must buy another one.</li>
            <li>The first time I used this product</li>
            <li>My first one just gave out.</li>
            <li>so you can tell one from another if more than two people in a household use the same product.</li>
            <li>The only downfall is it seems to drip a bit more water while I am brushing my teeth.</li>
            <li>First my Pros and Cons</li>
            <li>This is my first rechargable toothbrush.</li>
            <li>My first one lasted eight years.</li>
            <li>lost first one at hotel in bangcock).</li>
            <li>I was astounded the first time I used it.</li>
            <li>The first lasted for years before the battery no longer held a charge.  </li>
            <li>This model had both but not like a higher price model.  </li>
            <li>Would recommend to any one interested in one.</li>
            <li>Features include four 30 second cycles that are for the four quadrents of your mouth, and a pressure sensor to make sure you don&#x27;t brush too hard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>We bought our first one of these about 15 years ago.  </li>
            <li>but it actually goes around the tooth a lot better.  </li>
            <li>My last oral b lasted for many years.</li>
            <li>No complaints ;-)</li>
            <li>But after a few days, it seems to be a good product.</li>
            <li>Good for your teeth and gums,  gives the just came from the hygienist feel everyday.</li>
            <li>In any case, I love this new brush - it&#x27;s more \\&quot;powerful\\&quot; than the old one and has a smaller footprint on the bathroom counter.  </li>
            <li>Very powerful brushing action, prompts you to switch quadrant, has wear indicators, not expensive.  </li>
            <li>After the first time brushing my teeth with this gem my teeth felt as clean as if I just left the dentist for a teeth clean.</li>
            <li>Nice, portable, easy to use toothbrush; battery last for a long time (about a week) .</li>
            <li>My husband says he loves his new tooth brush more than his old oral b vitality tooth brush.</li>
            <li>If you are new to this kind of toothbrush, you will immediately feel the difference from regular brush.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The new one has nice blue color and a led to indicate when charging.&lt;br /&gt;We also have a years supply of brush heads for it.</li>
            <li>The Oral-B Professional 1000 is very useful, and I am thinking about getting a newer generation.</li>
            <li>Without being able to remove the toothbrush, the unit is too tall to fit into a typical bathroom cabinet shelf, unless you rearrange the shelves and everything on them.  </li>
            <li>The precision clean brush head is not too hard or soft and does a great job.  </li>
            <li>I have been using the Original Oral-B 3D Electric toothbrush for about the last 5 years and have been loving it before it finally died.</li>
            <li>I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT TO ANYONE WHO REALLY WANTS CLEAN TEETH.</li>
            <li>It takes a long time to get fully charged, and seems to lose power a lot sooner than expected, but otherwise, it does provide a good cleaning!</li>
            <li>My husband and kids are happily still using their SMART SERIES with an LCD panel that tells them if they are pressing too hard.</li>
            <li>, I always feel ready for bed when I use this, I also love how it comes with a charger, no batteries to mess and fumble with, easy and convenient.</li>
            <li>I can tell a difference between this and a regular brush, my teeth are squeaky clean, but I&#x27;ve not made it to my dentist to see if the claims are true of reversing periodontal disease...</li>
            <li>my teeth are always left feeling very clean</li>
            <li>Good toothbrush, just wondering how well the battery can last, works fine now, but I had one previously and after a while the battery performance just dwells.</li>
            <li>I was initially worried about the small diameter of the brush heads, but the size turned out to be perfect and my teeth feel much cleaner after using this brush than they ever did with a manual.  </li>
            <li>had the higher level more expensive model with 2 additional settings that I never used.&lt;br /&gt;Quality and good value.</li>
            <li>but it is a lot noisier than other electric toothbrush I&#x27;ve own.</li>
            <li>I was really pleased to find that this one worked at a higher frequency than the old one, and the result was that my mouth felt considerably cleaner after use.</li>
            <li>My old Braun toothbrush heads fit on this and works just fine, and the main brush handle also fits the old charger and charges also.</li>
            <li>The handle is very comfortable, the battery charge lasts a long time and my teeth are cleaner than when I brush by hand.</li>
            <li>Dental cost down and healthy teeth and gums up!</li>
            <li>This here toothbrush along with some whitening toothpaste, and I have entered a whole new world of clean teeth.  </li>
            <li>This toothbrush had everything I needed, great vibration and agitation of the teeth and gums, a nice recharger, and easy to hold with a small enough head to reach tight places in your mouth.</li>
            <li>(The 1000 model number replaced the 7400 model number which replaced the 3D number, all without any claim of being a new model, but no doubt there have been some updates to it over the years.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon sells a lot of replacement heads that fit this brush (and there are several kinds of heads that fit).  </li>
            <li>this version has a larger head and thus seems more effective than the previous model I had</li>
            <li>Clean and clear.</li>
            <li>I always thought that no electric toothbrush would clean my teeth any better than good old fashioned brushing, but I was totally wrong.  </li>
            <li>My teeth feel really clean after using this device and the plaque along my gum line is nearly gone after just a couple weeks.  </li>
            <li>Gets your teeth almost as clean as a professional cleaning.</li>
            <li>I use a sensitive brush and my teeth feel clean and there is no pain.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s head gently pulsates to break up plaque and rotates to sweep it away, removing up to 2x more plaque than a regular manual brush .</li>
            <li>They all brush the same way and give you the same good results.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>The flashing read light after use indicates that charging is needed and we choose to deplete the battery before recharge although this is unnecessary for good battery life.  </li>
            <li>I upgraded to this model from my old Oral-B and it is MUCH better than my old one.  </li>
            <li>while it is possible to spend much more on an electronic toothbrush, i really doubt you are getting cleaner teeth for</li>
            <li>The brush has last all this time without replacing them although wear and tear is becoming evident.</li>
            <li>I own both the Philips Sonicare Essence 5300 and the Oral-B Professional Care 1000 and have used both extensively.  </li>
            <li>Also, for the cost this is almost just as good as the much more expensive rechargeable toothbrushes.</li>
            <li>overall size of the handle and charger is more compact than the 5000 series making it much easier to pack in a travel</li>
            <li>Its ok, I haven&#x27;t used it much since i switched back to manual brushing!</li>
            <li>It only needs charging (for me) every 10 days and charges quickly after that first full charge.</li>
            <li>I feel the cleaning action is better with the floss action brush.  </li>
            <li>The toothbrush will pause its normal vibration after a certain period of time, and you get a really thorough clean if you follow its lead.</li>
            <li>I love this toothbrush, I like how small the head is to make it super easy to clean all angles of the back teeth.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m no dental professional, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s wise to pay more for a toothbrush just because it has a little more raw power.</li>
            <li>Also, does not take up too much room on bathroom counter and replacement brushes are very reasonable.  </li>
            <li>Sometimes a light brushing and some flossing or toothpick action would serve you better than long, intense brushing.  </li>
            <li>The fine design leaves few open areas, so no slime can collect as it did in my Sonicare , and it is very easy to keep the electric handle &amp; brush clean after each use..</li>
            <li>this doesn&#x27;t mean that Oral-b is better than Sonicare, it just means I prefer the Oral-b more.</li>
            <li>if you open your mouth just right, it will sound like someone is playing a didgeridoo in your bathroom.</li>
            <li>The value is a good, and they take up very little counter space even in the charger.  </li>
            <li>The 30 second and 2 minute timer pulses are super cool.  </li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t cleaning my teeth like I would like had to upgrade heard positive things about this product.</li>
            <li>The charger is very small, and the product easy to hold and operate (as well as easy to keep clean).</li>
            <li>Well, either that particular feature is not working on this Oral B toothbrush, or I am brushing with the right pressure.  </li>
            <li>If you still notice a smell of bacteria, or just want to make sure to get it extra clean, use very hot water when rinsing or even have a spray bottle of strong alcohol available to spray into the bottom of the brush head before you lay it down to dry out.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>Thanks so much!</li>
            <li>It works exactly as intended and holds a charge very well.  </li>
            <li>other great thing about these Oral-B brushes is that they will last 5-7 years before the battery weakens noticeably in power.  </li>
            <li>This is a great replacement for a old similar brush that was finally worn out.</li>
            <li>The most satisfactory purchase of anything that I&#x27;ve made in a long time.</li>
            <li>Much cheaper than the higher models,</li>
            <li>This is my first electronic toothbrush, so can&#x27;t really compare to anything else.  </li>
            <li>I love the fact that it gives you a time for each quadrant you brush which makes me much more careful in brushing all my teeth equally.  </li>
            <li>It takes about 24 hours to charge and recharge which seems long, but not terrible.  </li>
            <li>It is far superior than the other brands I&#x27;ve owned over the years.</li>
            <li>Use the Dual Action, full sized heads for maximum effect, that&#x27;s easier.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I loved that this toothbrush was so affordable compared with the usual $125-$150 electrics out there</li>
            <li>When our old Oral B couldn&#x27;t hold a charge for a full 2 minute brush anymore, we knew it was time to replace it.</li>
            <li>Really good product and the toothbrush head is small</li>
            <li>I really like the 30 second buzz feature to make sure that you aren&#x27;t spending too much time on one part of your mouth.</li>
            <li>I really shopped around for a good toothbrush, and although this was not the most expensive model I looked at it</li>
            <li>/&gt;It takes a long time to charge up fully the first time, but that&#x27;s a good thing since the charger is not forcing a lot of current into the battery.</li>
            <li>The only down side is the induction recharging, which requires a good 15 to 17 hours for full recharge.</li>
            <li>A small easy travel charging dock (if you are going to be gone for more than 5 days and have to possibly need to recharge), and easy to understand battery indicators.</li>
            <li>The miser in me wants to continue until the head simply falls apart, but it&#x27;s much better to just break down and get a new one at that point, thereby avoiding the discomfort, and getting back to enjoying the luxury of a nice electronic toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I get the same squeaky clean fresh feeling after I brush using either the Oral-b or Sonicare.</li>
            <li>but that is fine as I only use it on higher speed.</li>
            <li>An older model Oral B toothbrush which I have had for many years recently started quitting almost every time I used it.  </li>
            <li>find this brush to be a much better design than an older electric brush we had years back.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Using different technologies and approaches, Oral-b&#x27;s high-end toothbrushes like the PC 1000 improve your oral hygiene not only by having a stronger action than the cheap competition (including its own low-cost vibrating toothbrushes),</li>
            <li>Good price, but they seem very firm.</li>
            <li>Still using this toothbrush til this day, bought it many years ago, works and functions great, kind of annoying now to brush my teeth using a regular manual toothbrush.</li>
            <li>one more cute observation--when looking to buy this toothbrush, I did also check a well-known internet auction site--yes, that one--and was very surprised to observe that in addition to Sellers offering new units, some sellers were offering \\&quot;slightly used\\&quot; electric Oral-B Pro Care model 1000 toothbrushes.</li>
            <li>Just one more cute observation--when looking to buy this toothbrush, I did also check a well-known internet auction site--yes, that one--and was very surprised to observe that in addition to Sellers offering new units, some sellers were offering \\&quot;slightly used\\&quot; electric Oral-B Pro Care model 1000 toothbrushes.</li>
            <li>The motion of the brush head is comfortable even on my sensitive teeth although it seems clumsily large, and only my next checkup will tell how effective it is in cleaning my teeth.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a fun new &amp;#34;toy&amp;#34; for them.</li>
            <li>As many reviewers have said, the brush can be a bit rough at first, but you get used to it.</li>
            <li>Much quieter than the older Oral-B toothbrush I had been using (whose battery finally gave up after many years of use).</li>
            <li>Cochrane does meta-analyses and they are very conservative, which means that when they say something, it is pretty much true.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I can get to the back teeth easily without gaging myself.  </li>
            <li>&amp; she couldn&#x27;t believe that I could get to the back teeth so easily.  </li>
            <li>&amp; she couldn&#x27;t believe that I could get to the back teeth so easily.  </li>
            <li>the funtion is simple and easy to use.</li>
            <li>I can easily change the type of various brush heads depending upon what function I want to perform.&lt;br /&gt;More</li>
            <li>I feel they clean better especially hard-to-reach places like the back teeth.</li>
            <li>There are numerous features, but it&#x27;s easy to use.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s easy to reach areas that regular toothbrushes can not reach</li>
            <li>We pop the head off after every use and dry the end with a towel just to make sure we keep things clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This toothbrush was easy to figure out, and definitely does the job.</li>
            <li>Easy to find and replace brushes when necessary.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use; stays charged for several weeks;</li>
            <li>The smaller head makes it a lot easier to get the backside of the molars, and the different heads allow me to get a deeper and more thorough clean between my teeth and along the gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;There is a wide assortment of heads available as this toothbrush works with the full line of oral b heads.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s easy enough to charge it up.</li>
            <li>Alternatively, you would color one ring with fingernail polish and let it dry before putting it on a brush head, or just use some colored tape around one or more of them in your bathroom.</li>
            <li>My two previous electric Oral-B toothbrushes has a nice feel in my hand size-wise.</li>
            <li>It is conpact, can reach the back side of the the teeth, easy handle and cleans well</li>
            <li>The rest of my family uses the very prominent and considerably more expensive alternative whose name rhymes with tonic share.  </li>
            <li>This toothbrush works well enough - it&#x27;s not as fast as the better Oral-B models, but it does a decent job.</li>
            <li>I strongly recommend that if you only want to spend about 40 dollars, get the sonicare essence 5600 or whatever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Philips uses sonic technology that causes the brush to vibrate extremely fast without it actually moving much; this subtle quality creates a more pleasant brushing experience than the Oral-B.  </li>
            <li>The replacement brushes last a long time and good quality.  </li>
            <li>A year later and still going strong.</li>
            <li>Provides strong cleaning power and charges last through a week vacation.</li>
            <li>I do strongly recommend this product for the following reasons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Works great, this is my second one, wouldn&#x27;t have any other!</li>
            <li>The power fades in and out at certain angles.</li>
            <li>Would certainly buy it again and recommend it to a friend.</li>
            <li>certainly don&#x27;t have recourse...</li>
            <li>I was looking for certain features - timer, pressure sensor.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t hold a charge as long as I would like and recharging takes the better part of a day, but for the price I really can&#x27;t complain too much about that.  </li>
            <li>your entire attitude towards brushing; while the cost of it is not much more than what you would pay for not too many of Oral-b&#x27;s own vibrating manual</li>
            <li>your entire attitude towards brushing; while the cost of it is not much more than what you would pay for not too many of Oral-b&#x27;s own vibrating manual toothbrushes.    </li>
            <li>I have purchased two of the above Oral-B Professional 1000 Toothbrushes and received two letters stating that I must send original UPC barcodes with the original receipt and application in order to receive the $20 rebate.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this for myself from Walmart a few years ago &amp; LOVE it!</li>
            <li>The new one (1000) has a smaller charging station, which I thought would be more convenient for travel.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like the new one as well, but my old model is no longer available.</li>
            <li>The new model helps me to keep cleaning my teeth with a more regular and even hand.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s also easy to clean, which is one of the problems that I had with my previous model of Oral-B electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Miss the holder for multiple brushes I had with my previous unit, otherwise happy with purchase.  </li>
            <li>I have used a previous model Oral-B electric toothbrush, but this one is far superior.  </li>
            <li>Best toothbrush, easy to charge, corded base.</li>
            <li>Really strong Brush and the only thing is that the replacement Brushes cost almost just as much as the brush itself.</li>
            <li>Recommended by my dentist for inflamed gums [so embarrassing] and it is far superior to my previous brush.  </li>
            <li>Oral-B. Easy and tiny to use and reasonable price.</li>
            <li>A good value if you need only a single unit and solo charger.</li>
            <li>All in all a good tooth brush, just a shame that it only comes with a single head</li>
            <li>It can easily take 16 hours for a full charge when run down.</li>
            <li>/&gt;- Cheap, portable, powerful and easy to handle&lt;br /&gt;con:&lt;br /&gt;- little bit loud, no setting to adjust the rotation speed.</li>
            <li>(brush heads that worked on the old brush all work on this new brush, another nice thing for them to have left alone!).</li>
            <li>Seems like a fine basic electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Works fine, does the job, simple, no problem.</li>
            <li>I have the higher end version of this toothbrush that has the timer display and many other features.  </li>
            <li>For less money than we spent 3 years ago on our old one, we got a great toothbrush!</li>
            <li>Surely a Braun product should be lasting more than 2 and a half years.  </li>
            <li>Battery life - pretty decent</li>
            <li>I replaced my older Oral B model with this one and what a difference!  </li>
            <li>of my personal dental hygiene recommendations:  Be a bit careful about using baking soda or toothpastes with strong abrasives if you are an &#x27;over-brusher&#x27; which can cause even more worn enamel.  </li>
            <li>As usual, Amazon&#x27;s service was exceptional.</li>
            <li>Does a great job, I do throw the head that comes with it away and use a sensitive, softer head (better for the gums, less harsh).  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use, easy to keep charged, has a wealth of bristle choices, takes up a small footprint, and seems to work well.</li>
            <li>Simple, easy to charge, easy to wash and to replace the brushes, the battery lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>He said I was brushing too hard, and that this brush would help keep a good firmness and cleanliness to my brushing.  </li>
            <li>The extra thrills of the smart series will not be used by most consumers (sensitive and polishing cycles, feedback display, etc).</li>
            <li>This new unit cleans my teeth exceptionally well, is stoutly built, and should last at least as many years as its predecessor.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The 1st was great, but was powered by two AA batteries, and I felt bad going through so many of them over time.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a light on the brush that flashes red when it&#x27;s ready to be recharged.  </li>
            <li>Just as effective as the more expensive units.</li>
            <li>/&gt;There is only one speed which isn&#x27;t a huge issue.  </li>
            <li>I also noticed a huge difference when I floss afterwards (without getting too gross).</li>
            <li>This difference is huge and on close inspection, I noticed the Oral-B left my teeth cleaner.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>very well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My teeth just feel so much cleaner with the Oral-B.  </li>
            <li>and I really like it.  </li>
            <li>you really do get that straight from the dentist feel after every use.  </li>
            <li>i would absolutely recommend it to anyone.  </li>
            <li>It does of course cost twice as much, but comes with a travel case and two brush heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is a toothbrush that is really just as advertised</li>
            <li>To my dismay, the speed it too fast and after using it my, teeth hurt for days, not the gums, just the teeth.</li>
            <li>I have bought two of this,and I like it so much.</li>
            <li>You can tell its activated because the brush will sound different.  </li>
            <li>Works really well, need to take your time.</li>
            <li>Too much vibration&lt;br /&gt;can</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t like having to toss or recycle the whole handle because the battery can&#x27;t be replaced when it dies after a couple of years.</li>
            <li>This works very well</li>
            <li>The low battery indicator light does not flash when i push the on button.</li>
            <li>Apparently it is possible to replace the batteries if you&#x27;re comfortable handling circuit boards and soldering guns</li>
            <li>Oral-B is highly recommended by me!</li>
            <li>The newer slender handle design is much easier to manuveur</li>
            <li>to be purchased separately) cleans all surfaces very well,&lt;br /&gt;very</li>
            <li>/&gt;It fits very well in the hand and mouth.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The first thing I noticed was that the oscillating action of the brush is pretty intense.  </li>
            <li>very soon.&lt;br</li>
            <li>From what I can tell, it&#x27;s primarily cosmetic changes - and the 1000 only has one speed instead of two on the 3D</li>
            <li>The amount of time that my dental hygenist spends cleaning my teeth is much lower since I started using the Excel.  </li>
            <li>I dont recommend that you re-charge it after every use because it will kill the battery much faster.</li>
            <li>it really makes me feel upset.</li>
            <li>really?  </li>
            <li>It makes brushing a lot easier and you don&#x27;t have to think as much about what you&#x27;re doing.</li>
            <li>The motor for this isn&#x27;t quite precise enough</li>
            <li>/&gt;3)You can buy generic brush heads for $6.45 free shipping.</li>
            <li>It cleans my teeth very well.</li>
            <li>Reasonable price.</li>
            <li>I waited for over a month before doing this review because I wanted to see if this really works</li>
            <li>but I am very hopeful that this will happen.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it is ready to go.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This does not happen very</li>
            <li>When she was later scaling my teeth roots, she said they were smooth like glass.</li>
            <li>It vibrates so much that I couldn&#x27;t stand brushing my teeth.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Because they cant really move their hands easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Shipping completed in a very timely manner.</li>
            <li>and it generally get full charge by morning</li>
            <li>fast delivery</li>
            <li>I really like the Charge indicator that reminds me to take it out of my shower and place it on the charger.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my husband and he absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li>I really like knowing I have a variety of heads to choose from.</li>
            <li>works very well, and I count on it on every&lt;br /&gt;day now.</li>
            <li>I also never felt the toothbrush losing power or become weaker when the red light came on to tell me to charge it.</li>
            <li>so much I bought one for my husband and another for my son.</li>
            <li>And it is posted fast.</li>
            <li>I really line it and would recommend it to anyone in the market for this type of product.</li>
            <li>they get real nastee where to brush attaches (see reviews for the entry level sonic care for details)</li>
            <li>This toothbrush works very well for the money.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Independent of my prompting, my dentist also recommended this very toothbrush, reinforcing my belief in its goodness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This toothbrush works really well.</li>
            <li>, I really like it.</li>
            <li>I really like this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>The charge lasts for a whole week so you can bring the brush</li>
            <li>Oh, and it really does remove surface stains on the teeth.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t have much to compare it to, but I really like it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a mom on the run and don&#x27;t always have a lot of time to really brush well.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>I figured it&#x27;s the wiggling that does all of the work, so why not use a vibrating toothbrush to gently caress out my cares?</li>
            <li>Mr. Nippers really seems to like our massage sessions.</li>
            <li>And his wheel running has been much looser and easy-going since we started.</li>
            <li>It osculates much slower, but it still gets the job done.  </li>
            <li>Really helps gum health as well.</li>
            <li>and you really feel the difference.</li>
            <li>It is much lighter and the stand does not take up much space on the counter.  </li>
            <li>Oh and it&#x27;s much quieter than my wife&#x27;s Sonicare</li>
            <li>I notice that 2 minutes seems to go by much faster now</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re savvy enough, use the battery disposal instructions and take everything apart gently (primarily \\&quot;breaking\\&quot; the cap off the bottom and don&#x27;t use a screwdriver to pry the circuit board away from the battery).</li>
            <li>really like this oral b.  </li>
            <li>Very noisy but gets the job done.  </li>
            <li>it absolutely does.</li>
            <li>My teeth are very close together</li>
            <li>much prefer it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had electric toothbrushes b/4, but this really, really cleans my teeth &amp; massages my gums.</li>
            <li>If you absolutely prefer brush storage with your electric brush - this isn&#x27;t for you.</li>
            <li>The timing feature works very well and</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this toothbrush!</li>
            <li>however I must say that Amazon customer service was really helpful in the end</li>
            <li>you guessing as to how much time on each area.</li>
            <li>You can really feel the difference.</li>
            <li>The charging station is very convienent.</li>
            <li>Just what I wanted at a reasonable cost.</li>
            <li>Works even better than expected.  </li>
            <li>Toothbrush came in fast.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>While it is working, it cleans really well</li>
            <li>Brushes really well</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t feel like this cleans my teeth very well.  </li>
            <li>this product so much bought another identical one.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s gentle but noticible.  </li>
            <li>but he tried mine and also really noticed the difference</li>
            <li>and he really loves it as well.  </li>
            <li>so doesn&#x27;t take up much space in the bathroom.</li>
            <li>and they seemed to find a reasonable amount of tartar to scrape off each time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and they seemed to find a reasonable amount of tartar to scrape off each time.    </li>
            <li>I was surprised that a smaller brush head could be so much more efficient, but indeed it was compared with my SoniCare electric toothbrush which costs twice as much.</li>
            <li>I really like that option for this because my bf and I were going to share it.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;- VERY durable</li>
            <li>So the Precision 1000 works really well.</li>
            <li>i really like it.</li>
            <li>after some days it really can whiten my tooth.</li>
            <li>so the whole apartment does not hear me brush my teeth.</li>
            <li>Even flossing wouldn&#x27;t get rid of all of the plaque on my teeth, and my gums were receding because of it, but now even when I pick at my gum-line gently, there&#x27;s no tarter build-up at all.  </li>
            <li>and how much it helped, does take along time to charge up</li>
            <li>It came really fast amd</li>
            <li>It spends much faster than you could ever move your manual brush.</li>
            <li>Works very well.</li>
            <li>so I have to continually inhale gently to keep spit from coming out through the toothbrush head.</li>
            <li>Wait until the low battery light flashes.</li>
            <li>Bought this product on my hygienist&#x27;s recommendation and absolutely cannot believe the difference.  </li>
            <li>so I expected I&#x27;d need to buy the Sensitive brush heads for the 1000, but I&#x27;m happy with the standard brush head that came with the 1000.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>one issue I have with my 1000 is that I tried to test the pressure sensor alert to see what the result would be and what level of pressure the brush considers to be too much.</li>
            <li>oh, never mind.ert to see what the result would be and what level of pressure the brush considers to be too much.</li>
            <li>Works really well.  </li>
            <li>and your teeth actually feel cleaner, almost as smooth as just coming from the dentist.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is designed so that you work on one quadrant of your mouth at a time and eventually trains you to the tempo of how much time to spend on each tooth.  </li>
            <li>Oral-B has a round brush that acts more like a jackhammer in that it is much more physical and vigorous than the Philips.  </li>
            <li>I really need that?\\</li>
            <li>I really like tongue cleaner attachments, so I also managed to order the Mouthcare Essentials kit for $18.99/free ship from Bonanza</li>
            <li>- what really bugs me is the depth of the fat stem.</li>
            <li>- what really bugs me is the depth of the fat stem.</li>
            <li>This was recommended by my periodontist, and it really makes your teeth &amp;#34;dentist clean&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>I feel like it stimulates the gums and really cleans inside the pockets.  </li>
            <li>This product is really what a needed.</li>
            <li>It is made in Germany, so I expect it to last a lot longer than the cheaply made products from China.  </li>
            <li>Light, simple and as described.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>The handle design has not changed much.</li>
            <li>Four brush heads are available, with different designs &amp; functions.</li>
            <li>/&gt;*Cleans your teeth and gums really well</li>
            <li>If too much pressure is applied the head stops spinning until pressure is relieved.  </li>
            <li>Really, there isn&#x27;t anything else you&#x27;d need.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Really like it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>i can think of is when the battery gets weaker, so does the oscillation as well -- probably have to charge it before the red light starts flashing to maintain the intensity of the oscilliation&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;all</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>Really cleans and tells you when to advance to another section of your teeth.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>The buzzing sound is highly reminiscent of a dentist&#x27;s drill and took some getting used to.</li>
            <li>My teeth feel so much cleaner just like I came from the dentist.</li>
            <li>When you look in the stores, they often will only have one Oral B model available.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>I really like how the toothbrush works for me.</li>
            <li>It is gentle on the teeth and gums.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>You really get that just-been-to-the-dentist feeling.</li>
            <li>this is very aggressive.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Really?</li>
            <li>No unnecessary extras which I&#x27;ll never use, and which drain power.  </li>
            <li>it was a no brainer really.</li>
            <li>but it still gets the job done, highly recommended!</li>
            <li>or you really notice the brush heads wearing out.</li>
            <li>You could not possibly do worse.</li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>holds its charge &amp; doesn&#x27;t take up much space in cabinet.</li>
            <li>but it is just a gentle change in the speed of the brushing.  </li>
            <li>I really like this brush, so I reordered.  </li>
            <li>They really like it.</li>
            <li>I chose it because of the cost and because I didn&#x27;t want to invest too much in case he didn&#x27;t like an electric toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>brush, slender, charger stand does  not take up much room on the counter.</li>
            <li>I really like this brush.  </li>
            <li>Very suprised at speed.  </li>
            <li>heads are reasonably priced.&lt;br /&gt;Lets</li>
            <li>reminder to move to another quadrant is gentle.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve used it now three days and dislike it so much it&#x27;s headed for the trash bin).</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s really helpful.</li>
            <li>You need only use a light touch and can feel this brush cleaning.</li>
            <li>Takes care of the whole tooth nothing but the tooth so help me.</li>
            <li>In my opinion, it cleans very well.</li>
            <li>But it also feels a bit \\&quot;cheaper\\&quot;, and the light blue color isn&#x27;t attractive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very happy!&lt;br</li>
            <li>This was much cheaper (</li>
            <li>My mouth feels SOOOO much cleaner.</li>
            <li>This toothbrush is crazy awesome!!  </li>
            <li>Works very well.</li>
            <li>One charge lasts for over a week, and I really like the timer.</li>
            <li>charges over night, ready to use in the morning.</li>
            <li>My teeth feel so much cleaner than when I brush my teeth by hand.</li>
            <li>The price was reasonable and according to my wife it works very well.</li>
            <li>What has made me very upset about this whole experience is the rebate.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It doesn&#x27;t bother me so much to have lost $20.</li>
            <li>i really like the quality of this toothbrush for the price</li>
            <li>Also, it really massages the gum-line very well, too.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t mind this so much, were there anywhere on the page where it said what comes in the package.</li>
            <li>but it really should have come with a travel case.</li>
            <li>After resisting I now feel foolish as this product works very well.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>I know my teeth feel much cleaner, than when I brush with</li>
            <li>I switched to this electric toothbrush and my teeth are so much cleaner.</li>
            <li>you don&#x27;t have to replace the head very often,</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think I would care that I get a reminder to change quandrants, but it is really helpful.</li>
            <li>(rotations are a bit aggressive) and when it&#x27;s about to die (not just by the flashing red light either).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using cheap electric toothbrushes for years, and finally switched to this mid-rage model.  </li>
            <li>My teeth always feel much cleaner now and my gums feel stronger.</li>
            <li>It cleans very well.  </li>
            <li>battery life is reasonable.  </li>
            <li>For me, this makes thorough cleaning much easier than when using a toothbrush with an oval head.</li>
            <li>(btw, I change the heads on these brushes almost monthly because it feels like the plaque builds up so fast now) - she&#x27;s astounded at</li>
            <li>HOW MUCH PLAQUE I HAVE.</li>
            <li>had to send it back the brushing head didnt fit on all the way.</li>
            <li>Also very sanitary in that way.</li>
            <li>Works very well.</li>
            <li>I have used this brand of toothbrush for better than 15 years with absolutely no complaints what so ever.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed much difference between the two except</li>
            <li>difference between the sonic toothbrush and this one is that this one stops spinning if too much pressure is applied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>One minute on each side with gentle pressure cleaned up years of stains and cleaned areas</li>
            <li>Cleans my teeth very well.</li>
            <li>My teeth feel so much cleaner</li>
            <li>feels like it really cleans efficiently</li>
            <li>this one moves so fast I had to get used to it</li>
            <li>Oral B replacement heads are reasonably priced also.</li>
            <li>However, this one really works.  </li>
            <li>My teeth feel much cleaner after using this brush.  </li>
            <li>brush heads are a hollow tube with holes at the top and the bottom, so</li>
            <li>my wife loves it and so do i. thanks again</li>
            <li>Charger works very well.  </li>
            <li>electric toothbrush works very well.</li>
            <li>There are generic brush heads available.</li>
            <li>We bought two of them and fortunately they had different colors to tell them apart.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I still really like my brush</li>
            <li>I do like the powerful vibrations of the brush head, maybe even stronger than my old ones.</li>
            <li>better than expected.</li>
            <li>It is a very low-end product.  </li>
            <li>Product works better than expected.</li>
            <li>would highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>What a difference - holds a charge longer than the instructions say and is much lighter (brush as well as the charger).  </li>
            <li>Even works on the tongue really well.</li>
            <li>It works very well.</li>
            <li>My teeth feel so much cleaner using this brush rather than a manual brush.</li>
            <li>and it holds a charge very well.</li>
            <li>It works much better than the old one and after brushing it feels like I just left the dentist&#x27;s office!</li>
            <li>and my mouth feels fresher compared to using manual brushes (kind of similar feeling after going to the dentist for regular cleaning).</li>
            <li>The motion is really nice, however it is missing the ability to change speeds.</li>
            <li>Oral-B has a number of brushes available - the Sonic, Vitality, the Professional Care family (which comprises the 1000 and 3000), and the Professional Care SmartSeries (4000 and 5000).</li>
            <li>Overall I find the Oral-b 1000 to be a well made, simple to use, and effective electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Simple, silent, effective.</li>
            <li>I had my old Braun/oralB for many years and it finally stopped charging.  </li>
            <li>and I only got 1 cavity (while I used to have more frequently).</li>
            <li>I bought this to replace my many years old one of the same model.  </li>
            <li>You really don&#x27;t need more bells and whistles (including a bigger stand that takes up more space on your counter) than this unit, which uses the same brushes I had on hand from my last Oral-B brush.</li>
            <li>That has never happened to me before because I have not been brushing properly time wise or using the wrong kind of toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>and I think it does at least a good of a job at cleaning my teeth.</li>
            <li>With this model, I just run some warm water over it every few days, and voila.</li>
            <li>I run the brush till the battery is almost dead before i recharge it, this model also has a recharging-charged led which I find handy.</li>
            <li>This oral-b keeps my teeth cleaner, requires minimal maintenance and provides gentle, effective brushing action.</li>
            <li>This is half the cost of the one I replaced, and although it does not have the bells and whistles of the older model, it is every bit as effective when it comes to oral hygiene.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;-Brush heads are easily replaced and last a decent amount of time before needing to be replaced&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I recently purchased the Oral-B Professional Care 1000 and I love it.</li>
            <li>I own a sonic-care and I ordered this as a second brush that brush&#x27;s differently (circular)</li>
            <li>The brush head seems small at first but is totally effective.</li>
            <li>Far better than my last Oral-B&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I suppose that&#x27;s where the \\&quot;precision\\&quot; comes into play -- it was far easier to get in all the crevices and corners than with a standard toothbrush -- but it also meant I found myself more than once clanging the plastic edge of the head against my enamel.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I like it, but I don&#x27;t like the round headed brush as well as I liked the rectangular headed Oral B that this one replaced.  </li>
            <li>I had an old Oral B electric toothbrush that finally died after many years.  </li>
            <li>but if you do a good job on each tooth with a plain old manual toothbrush, I would probably save my money.</li>
            <li>I got this toothbrush about a month and a half ago to replace a Sonic Care one that died on me and so far I love it even more than my old one when it was new.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this toothbrush for anyone that wants to have superbly clean teeth in general and for anyone with sensitivity issues.</li>
            <li>or more twice a day for a week, my teeth felt extra clean similar to the feeling I get after I&#x27;ve received a professional teeth cleaning.  </li>
            <li>After the first brush with this new tooth brush, I could feel an immediate difference.  </li>
            <li>so far I have to say I made the right choice.</li>
            <li>It vibrates very quickly and has a long battery life between charges.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure I would like the tiny head on it, but I can easily see that I have lots less tartar...</li>
            <li>If your teeth are used to a good scrubbing there is no need to even use anything other than the standard brush</li>
            <li>I replaced an older more expensive model but this one seems to be as effective</li>
            <li>As the review on The Wirecutter mentions, and as confirmed with a simple search, the sonic toothbrushes are really just a marketing gimmick and all the extra cleaning options don&#x27;t really add any true</li>
            <li>have found my teeth to feel reallllllly clean after using this brush, that super smooth and slick just had them professionally cleaned feeling.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>as stated&lt;br /&gt;-different brush heads are all essentially the same, except for the flossing one which actually works pretty good</li>
            <li>First off it very loud.  </li>
            <li>These are far better than the old model, which we thought was pretty terrific.</li>
            <li>The brush is much quieter than the older model that I use and it is much slimer.</li>
            <li>but once I did, I feel like I&#x27;m REALLY getting my teeth clean, finally!!!</li>
            <li>This one is simple and straightforward.  </li>
            <li>after call finally led to \\&quot;please resend the original paperwork.....</li>
            <li>I notice that a lot of the negative comments mention it, so apparently it&#x27;s either more pronounced in some units than others, or many folks just aren&#x27;t as bothered by it.</li>
            <li>This is an item I would glad recommend to other of my friends and family&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>When I other Oral-B died after many years use</li>
            <li>I purchased this product to replace my original Oral-B rechargeable that finally wore out after 16 years.</li>
            <li>After one month of brushing teeth and before using a traditional tooth brush, I noticed a significant improvement.</li>
            <li>Originally purchased the Oral-B 1000 at a big box retailer as it was on sale at a price lower than Amazon.  </li>
            <li>So much better than the other brand.</li>
            <li>get a letter back saying the rebate request is incomplete because they did not receive an original UPC--can I please send it.</li>
            <li>And, believe it or not, my original Oral-B just recently died after over 20 YEARS use twice a day by 2 people.</li>
            <li>(admittedly it takes a long time for each charge, but that&#x27;s not a big deal), and is easy to clean.</li>
            <li>one benefit of using electronic toothbrushes is that people spend more time brushing their teeth with electronic toothbrushes than with manual toothbrushes, so there&#x27;s a decent chance that other electronic toothbrushes might, in the real world, outperform manual toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li>I was additionally pleased that the Oral-B/Braun folks still use the same size charger -- I set the new brush on the old charger and it started charging immediately</li>
            <li>I brush twice a day but even if I forget to brush one night, the next morning my teeth STILL feel clean.  </li>
            <li>One word can only describe how clean this toothbrush cleans your teeth....</li>
            <li>Works fine and holds charge really long.</li>
            <li>Peppy brush and works well to clean up back teeth.</li>
            <li>So overall, I do recommend this brush as it does seem to clean well.</li>
            <li>Should have taken care of my older units as I feel their build quality used to be much higher.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My teeth have never felt so clean or looked as white.</li>
            <li>/&gt;You&#x27;ll reach all the way back to clean</li>
            <li>Its pretty fun actually.</li>
            <li>my teeth are clean and it&#x27;s helping my gums that use to bleed when I brushed my teeth.</li>
            <li>Simple to keep clean.</li>
            <li>I took it on a week long business trip without the charger and worked fine through out.</li>
            <li>This is a toothbrush for those who wanna keep their teeth clean as possible!</li>
            <li>Was looking for a toothbrush to clean the back of my rear teeth.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>Easy to clean and small on the counter.</li>
            <li>Used to be my mouth only felt this clean after a dentist visit.</li>
            <li>particular what type of toothpaste used or the heads would wear out really fast.&lt;br /&gt;Hard</li>
            <li>This 1000 model only proves the company upgrades performance  and quality consistently.</li>
            <li>I do not feel as clean when I use a regular toothbrush.</li>
            <li>The price was pretty steep for me when compared to a regular tooth brush, but now seeing the performance was worth it.  </li>
            <li>charge also seems to take awhile, although this is an issue that I had mainly because my bathroom doesn&#x27;t really have any outlets, so I had to charge the toothbrush in a separate room.</li>
            <li>my teeth feel clean and they look white</li>
            <li>(Target sold these for 39 bucks for a while)&lt;br /&gt;-different brush head designs available (over half a dozen) for different cleaning styles (also a con)&lt;br /&gt;-rechargeable&lt;br /&gt;-cleans better than manual brushes</li>
            <li>He says it gives his teeth a deeper clean than a regular toothbrush.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re an average American, high-end electric toothbrushes and water picks have always been things you saw in movies on television in the bathrooms of the rich-the people who had good things that you didn&#x27;t have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Admittingly the UV sterialization of the head by Sonicare is a good thing but to me it was not worth the extra cost.  </li>
            <li>really cleans well, would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Happy with Amazon, not happy with new Oral-B.</li>
            <li>But if you don&#x27;t have a big mouth or some special skill which I seem to lack, the machine will CATCH ON YOUR LIPS or even your tongue.  </li>
            <li>Nothing special, no extra setting, just click the button and vibrates.</li>
            <li>These toothbrushes are way better than conventional or battery powered brushes.</li>
            <li>By the way, my dentist says my teeth look better sense using this versus conventional brush.</li>
            <li>This one is a replacement as the other wore out and it is just as good as the one I had for over 10 years with several new features.</li>
            <li>It only has one speed and that is super fast.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s a good thing because you really can wear off enamel from hard and frequent brushing.</li>
            <li>The higher models probably have one too, but I don&#x27;t know how useful they are, and this one little quirk certainly wasn&#x27;t worth the added expense to me</li>
            <li>The higher models probably have one too, but I don&#x27;t know how useful they are, and this one little quirk certainly wasn&#x27;t worth the added expense to me</li>
            <li>is the new age of \\&quot;SMART PRODUCTS\\&quot;:&lt;br /&gt;1)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Oral B Electric Toothbrushes for as long as they were available until my pervious dentist suggested a Phillips Sonicare Electric Toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Light rechargeable and holds the charge a long time.&lt;br</li>
            <li>somewhere in the middle is the sweet spot.  </li>
            <li>somewhere in the middle is the sweet spot.  </li>
            <li>first thing I noticed in Oral-b 100 Professional Care</li>
            <li>you go higher in the Professional Care family</li>
            <li>I left mine unplugged for the first full week until it died completely</li>
            <li>Not much of a surprise however, as the cleaning action of the Oral B is much more vigorous and intense.  </li>
            <li>This one, though, leaves pieces of food between my teeth and along my gum line, even when brushing for the full 2 minutes, in 30 second quadrants.  </li>
            <li>This was the first professional electric toothbrush I ever bought, so I wasn&#x27;t looking to spend a lot of money.</li>
            <li>It did have to charge overnight initially to reach a full charge.</li>
            <li>Also, it is helpful that the &amp;#34;timer&amp;#34; goes off every 30 seconds by changing the brush pattern for 2 seconds - so if you are trying to acheive a full 2 minutes with giving equal attention to areas of the mouth, this is helpful.  </li>
            <li>Brush head seems kind of small.</li>
            <li>The true test will be my next dentist appointment.</li>
            <li>Without renewed charging, a full charge will last 35-40 minutes.</li>
            <li>It has a nice small charger.</li>
            <li>I bought this to replace my 12 year old Oral-B tooth brush and it is better than the old one, I will never buy a different brand.</li>
            <li>In addition to the oscillating action of the brush head, that comfortably and cleans each tooth, this model also now has a pulsating action and is an improvement over the 20 year old model.</li>
            <li>So the $20 is true ONLY IF you buy one.</li>
            <li>Very user friendly, portable, and the charge lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li>Not bad for instant gratification.</li>
            <li>Also, the new charging unit does not have a place to wrap excess cord like the old one did; and, no, the new handle won&#x27;t fit on the old charging unit.  </li>
            <li>Gentle enough to brush without  hurting my gums, but powerful enough to leave my teeth feeling incredibly clean.  </li>
            <li>So, for me, the single speed on the 1000 was just fine.  </li>
            <li>This thing cleans better, hands down.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m sure helped keep my dentist bills down.</li>
            <li>I was really looking forward to that brush head holder, but since the brush has been delivered I was able to undergo all of the stages of grief and finally have come to accept that I wont be able to proudly display my brush heads next to the charger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Onto</li>
            <li>It takes right at two days undisturbed on the charger to reach a full charge AND from full charge we get 2-3 brushings before the motor runs too slow to be useful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love the small and simply docking/charging station, and how easily the brush head fits onto the toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I forgot my other Oral-B in Europe, so I decided to just get a new one because my teeth just don&#x27;t feel healthy without an electronic toothbrush.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I am not sure how many vibrations/rotations my old brush had, but this one feels like there is more motion overall.</li>
            <li>This new electrical toothbrush really is heaven sent.</li>
            <li>I expect to use the this toothbrush for many years as I did my previous Oral-B toothbrush.</li>
            <li>This one is much better than the previous Oral-B.  </li>
            <li>The instructions recommend unplugging the charger between charges, which is a slight inconvenience, though that should probably be done for most chargers these days.  </li>
            <li>My previous ORAL B gave up after many years of use.  </li>
            <li>previously used a Sonicare Elite that stopped holding a charge for more than a minute after a couple months of use.</li>
            <li>This brush is better than my previous SonicCare electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Even my children have commented how the Oral-B is much better than their previous toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Although I use their top of the line 5000 series at home, I wanted something for travel use that was less bulky.</li>
            <li>My previous Oral-B rotating brush lasted for over 9 years, I just replaced it with the updated version at a much better price than I paid 10 years ago.  </li>
            <li>The older model just showed a dim, steady light to indicate it was working properly.  </li>
            <li>Pleased about the product but after ordered, found one for a lot less money.  </li>
            <li>And it seems to get between the teeth and onto the gums better than my previous one.</li>
            <li>I bought this as a replacement for the Vitality toothbrush which I had previously used and which I was okay with.  </li>
            <li>but since they had four and a half stars, I figured they must be ok, and I&#x27;ll save a lot of money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li>Much better than my previous type...</li>
            <li>replaced an older model with this</li>
            <li>Get a model that uses the same brush heads as the higher-end models and you will get the same cleaning performance.ur teeth better, in my experience.  </li>
            <li>Why I didn&#x27;t replace my older model with this one I don&#x27;t know.</li>
            <li>Bought to replace an older OralB toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>I purchased an Oral-B 1000 to replace an older unit.  </li>
            <li>I had an older model and it held up for 3 years before giving out.  </li>
            <li>Replaced an older model.  </li>
            <li>Decent toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I had an older version of this which eventually died.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in a love hate relationship with Oral B. Product works great</li>
            <li>The 30 sec phases work, but it doesn&#x27;t shut off after 2 minutes...which is nice actually!</li>
            <li>The old one was fantastic, I don&#x27;t know what happened to them over the last 25 years.</li>
            <li>This is a upgrade from a Oral-B older version.</li>
            <li>Simply put, it does a better job at cleaning my teeth than a standard tooth brush.  </li>
            <li>I used to have an older model that had a wall mount kit.  </li>
            <li>We have an older model for 4 toothbrush heads.</li>
            <li>I bought this to replace my older and sluggish tooth brush.  </li>
            <li>I bought this toothbrush to replace an older version of it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Had to return -- I could not use for more than a few seconds without developing a headache and nausea, much like motion sickness.</li>
            <li>And that was one of the biggest draws to this product in particular.</li>
            <li>Replaced an older model.</li>
            <li>I believe this is a an older model.  </li>
            <li>You definitely will pay more at your local pharmacy department.</li>
            <li>Personally I prefer a product that has a simple operation without too many frills.</li>
            <li>difference in the smooth-running feel of this nicer tooth-brush versus the cheaper Oral-B one is pretty noticeable - the same level of difference I noticed when going from the cell-type battery brushes to my first Oral-B rechargeable one.  </li>
            <li>Therefore, many of my bathroom items are just outside the door on a small/short bookcase next to an outlet.  </li>
            <li>Price is decent for the quality.</li>
            <li>We bought it to replace an older model which I wish we still had.  </li>
            <li>I have had the Oral-B for several weeks now and works much better than the prior Braun unit.  </li>
            <li>While it lacks several of the more advanced features (the timer display module and various speeds, such as sensitive, gum massage, etc.)</li>
            <li>bells and whistles like the more expensive Oral B models, but a much better value.</li>
            <li>Upgraded to this electric toothbrush from an older model Oral-B.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m comparing this brush to an older OralB 7000DLX model that it was supposed to replace.</li>
            <li>I think it does a decent job.</li>
            <li>Not only is it powerful, it is gentle.  </li>
            <li>I have basically beaten back periodontal disease, such that there is no change for many years now.</li>
            <li>I got my older unit working.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure I often got impatient when brushing with simple brushes and stopped brushing too quickly without some guide to gently remind you that you need to brush for two minutes.  </li>
            <li>These are just refills for the main product.  </li>
            <li>Cheaper than the older version I had</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t spend money on a more expensive model.  </li>
            <li>I have been using Oral-B rechargeable electric toothbrushes for two years now (I have the older model that was replaced by this one)</li>
            <li>This toothbrush is the classic high-performance tool that Oral-B has offered for years with improvement in the streamline design that takes minimum counter space.</li>
            <li>The cleaning action is very vigorous and I feel that it is very cleaning well.</li>
            <li>This is the second one I&#x27;ve owned and it has made a tremendous difference, even my dentist has noticed.</li>
            <li>We were looking for an additional Oral B brush for a decent price.  </li>
            <li>but before I opened it I did a quick search online to read reviews and decided to return it because it only supports 110-130 V power supply</li>
            <li>I love that it flashes red when it needs recharging and hope that this format will help it last longer than the two years my Pulsonic did.  </li>
            <li>This toothbrush replaced an older model which succumbed to time.  </li>
            <li>Brought to replace a older Oral-B toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>Would like to be able to switch heads so that my husband can use the same unit (different head).  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t replaced the brushes yet, which I hear is the most expensive lifetime cost of a brush like this, but for now I&#x27;m totally satisfied.</li>
            <li>My older unit had a plastic travel case.</li>
            <li>I was using my favorite Sonicare toothbrush and flossing daily back then.</li>
            <li>I give it four stars because it only comes with one brush head and no place to store a second one so it cannot feasibly be used by two or more people.</li>
            <li>I had an older version and this replaced it.</li>
            <li>I had an older version of the Oral-B Electric toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>Upgrade from an older model to this.</li>
            <li>If you have an older Oral-B I would recommend upgrading</li>
            <li>My dentist recommended this particular brush for me.</li>
            <li>We chose the oral B electric tooth brush as a replacement for an older model, which still works.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not as strong brushing as I expected.</li>
            <li>It took one day to fully charge, it has very good power ,just don&#x27;t press down to hard on your teeth to much</li>
            <li>This toothbrush is very soft and gentle on my gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had once had an Oral-B Waterpik I had liked-- and a desire to compare the tooth cleaning experience between the sonic and the plain old electric toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Since it seems to be more effective, and cavities and other dental issues are even more expensive (and no fun to remedy), the cost may be worth it.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Either way I&#x27;d HIGHLY recommend this brush.  </li>
            <li>We highly recommend them to anyone looking for an electric toothbrush.</li>

            <li>Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I ordered the 1000 as it was the lowest level of the high powered models.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it for everyone..</li>
            <li>Highly recommend&#x27;</li>

            <li>Would highly recommend this item.</li>
            <li>Also, &#x27;tartar control&#x27; products are highly under-rated in my opinion.  </li>

            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Its high speed cleaning does the trick.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>In fact she highly recommended it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a first-rate electric tooth brush at a value price.</li>

            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Highly Recommended.&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li>I highly recommend Oral B (anything).</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this toothbrush.</li>
            <li>in all, works as well and highly recommended for first-timers though I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;ll get 20 years of use out of this model.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li>highly recommended.  </li>
            <li>This year I went to the dentist and she highly recommended that I get a Sonic brush.</li>
            <li>Seems to clean teeth well and has a long battery life.</li>
            <li>That said, I still like it better than Sonicare (the vibrating is less intense and I use the sensitive brush head).</li>
            <li>Nice charging stand - the Oral B 1000 can be charged even if some water is present due to its non-metal-on-metal contact between the charger and the brush.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>We are going to start our own basketball team and try to compete against the other families that have done the same.  </li>
            <li>Not too rough and does a fine job removing plaque.  </li>
            <li>Works fine as expected.</li>
            <li>a little more powerful.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The perfomance if this toothbrush is a little better</li>
            <li>We all love the way they work, how they keep their charge, and take up little space on the bathroom vanity.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Spend a little more and get a little more.  </li>
            <li>Raised in a struggling home, I was always taught that a little elbow grease can more than make up for a lot of what you lack otherwise.</li>
            <li>Compared with them, this one seems a little noisier, but not terrible.  </li>
            <li>there was a little more rubber grip on handle</li>
            <li>Also, a little more rubber for the grip would improve comfort and, of course, grip while using the brush.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>second one I have had, the first lasted about 3-4 years!  </li>
            <li>This model is a streamlined version of my old one and gives me the same clean feeling.</li>
            <li>This replaces an older model she had and so far she really likes the performance.</li>
            <li>My teeth don&#x27;t feel clean compared to using a regular brush plus it bothers my sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li>I had previously been using a cheap disposable electric toothbrush from Wal-Mart &amp;#34;Equate.&amp;#34; It seemed to do an okay job, and at least better than what a regular toothbrush could do for me.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quiet and has a timer that indicates every 30 seconds by a pause in action so you can thoroughly clean your teeth.  </li>
            <li>In general a like very much this product.</li>
            <li>Highly reviewed and for a reason, replace you normal tooth brush now and make the switch, you wont regret it.</li>
            <li>I admit that I haven&#x27;t actually been WOUNDED yet, but it is certainly disconcerting, and the first couple times it might scare you, so be warned.</li>
            <li>The replacement brush tips I had on hand for my old unit even fit the new one thus saving me the cost of having to purchase different ones for the new unit -- Oral-B replacement brushes aren&#x27;t cheap.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li>The electris toothbrush with the little round brush really works great.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s still a perfectly good electric toothbrush otherwise, though I really did want something that would warn me when I brushed too hard.</li>
            <li>I suggest buying from Amazon directly, instead of from a third-party supplier through Amazon, or from a reliable brick-and-mortar store, to ensure you get the real thing.ack</li>

            <li>Well, I really found out what sonic action is,&lt;br /&gt;even</li>
            <li>I bought Oral-B Professional care 1000 a month ago and really like it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The ORAL-B 1000 PROFESSIONAL CARE electric toothbrush product which I tested for Amazon Vine claims to stop pulsing if too much pressure is put on the teeth.</li>
            <li>I bought two \\&quot;Oral-B Professional Care 1000 Electric Rechargeable Power Toothbrush 1 Count\\&quot;, but I just received one reward card, could you explain it, thanks.</li>
            <li>Easier to keep these clean too - you just take it apart, wash each of the 2 pieces under water, dry with a towel</li>
            <li>His old electric toothbrush wasn&#x27;t doing the job and it was very noisy.</li>
            <li>The 1000 makes my teeth feels much cleaner than my old toothbrush.</li>
            <li>The battery holds a charge very well, so far.</li>
            <li>I found this toothbrush to be of great value over the Sonicare expensive models.</li>
            <li>I get this to replace my old Oral-B electric tootbrush that was on-lne for 10 whole years.</li>
            <li>I can also adjust the pressure so as to get me comfortable and not get it too rough for my gum and teeth.</li>
            <li>When I recharge it, it blinks a green light enough to light up the room.</li>
            <li>When it worked, it was great but it often failed to work for me.&lt;br /&gt;Consequently</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great toothbrush and the replacement heads aren&#x27;t as expensive as some.</li>
            <li>but I felt that the battery was beginning to lose charge quicker than normal</li>
            <li>It does a good job of getting around and between teeth, though the small opening in the plastic casing means, saliva, toothpaste and water will all get in their, which can get gross, unless you rinse well and take the brush head off from time to time to rinse out the inside.</li>
            <li>unlike manual toothbrushes, the PC 1000, helps to keep you honest and following the advice of dental care professionals by automatically reminding you to give each quarter of your mouth equal attention for a total of two minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But, well worth the price when you compare it to similar items.</li>
            <li>My last one lasted more than 10 years, so I&#x27;m hoping this one will be around for a long time.  </li>
            <li>my old battery operated one better, this is not worth the money.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know it&#x27;s a normal problem or</li>
            <li>Kids love them and it helps them know when they have brushes long enough because of the built in timer.  </li>
            <li>dentist feels the round head is better than ones normally found on toothbrushes.</li>
            <li>Regardless, I like the brush, and more so really like the small footprint of the charger.</li>
            <li>After more than 9 months of use, I now have to charge it after about 1 week of brushing for 2-3 min 2-3 times a day, but that&#x27;s how long the manual says it should last anyway.</li>
            <li>This is normal and happens with all electric toothbrushes.</li>
            <li>smile-- not psycho white like the news readers or club floozies ...</li>
            <li>Well worth sending back.</li>
            <li>I never really bought into the whole Oral-b vs. Sonicare debate because technically any electric toothbrush is better than a manual one.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been used to a normal toothbrush all these days....</li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t seem worth the money with such a limitation.</li>
            <li>This is like a lighter version of that, my teeth feel cleaner than they do with a normal brush</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this for a few weeks now and it is so much better than the one I had which required batteries.</li>
            <li>Its powerful and the timer promotes proper brushing.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s definitely an investment worth making.</li>
            <li>and I like the Oral-B much better because of the round brush.  </li>
            <li>At first I thought the price of an electric toothbrush was a bit much, but after using one I will never go back to a manual brush.</li>
            <li>Worth the money with cash back offer.</li>
            <li>The head of this brush is nice and small and the bristles are soft.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t find the sixty second alerts useful</li>
            <li>My teeth have been noticeably cleaner (I was using a normal toothbrush before).  </li>
            <li>and I have to brush it off with a normal brush.</li>
            <li>This feature alone makes this brush worth the purchase over simple brushes.  </li>
            <li>This is my second one, the battery wore out on the first one and it was cheaper to just replace the whole thing.  </li>
            <li>I discovered there are actually various versions of this product, but figuring out what was worth what was impossible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Sometimes I care a lot that an item is cheaper-built, and sometimes I am glad I saved a few dollars.</li>
            <li>After using this toothbrush for a few weeks, I&#x27;m quite pleased with it.</li>
            <li>First time I ever paid this much for a toothbrush; always bought the $10 and under ones at the big box store.  </li>
            <li>Does a nice job, isn&#x27;t too loud, holds a charge for at least a week, has a nice small footprint</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t want a toothbrush I can&#x27;t take with me for more than a few days before the battery dies.</li>
            <li>Appears to be well worth the price especially with the mail in coupon.  </li>
            <li>I was using a Sonicare for pretty much the last 10+ years.</li>
            <li>Both seem to equally make my teeth and mouth feel fresh.  </li>
            <li>The sonic set I was going to get was only 5 dollars more and came with an extra sensitive brush head....</li>
            <li>I find the single head easier to clean.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t keep it plugged in regularly, but it can easily hold full power for a few days.  </li>
            <li>The bristles are hard enough to feel like you got a good clean but soft enough that it doesn&#x27;t hurt your gums.  </li>
            <li>I paid twice as much for the OLD version than I did for the new version 1000 model.</li>
            <li>30 sec timers are very useful.</li>
            <li>It did take about 24 hours to initially charge, which surprised me, but recharges quickly after each use.</li>
            <li>and I was thrilled to see it cost half the price and had the same amount of stars.  </li>
            <li>Sound is ringing, easy bleeding, brushing your teeth is worse than the philips a lot</li>
            <li>This toothbrush is easy to use, especially for someone like me who has a smaller jaw.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anybody want to buy a year and a half old Rotadent with a worn out brush head : )</li>
            <li>Easy to use, pauses when it&#x27;s time to change to the next quadrant, ensuring all areas get brushed !</li>
            <li>Other models in that line have additional bells and whistles that for most people are unnecessary and therefore not cost effective.  </li>
            <li>I liked the small footprint of the charger, plus a $20 rebate!</li>
            <li>My new one has a few new features to make it even better, like the timer notes every 30 seconds of the 2 minute time, by vibrating, to let you move to another area of teeth cleaning.  </li>
            <li>so you know you&#x27;ve brushed each quadrant of your teeth for the right amount of time.</li>
            <li>The charging stand is smaller but right for the brush.</li>
            <li>He also stated that I would look forward to brushing again later in the day, and he was certainly right about that.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>/&gt;Pretty simple right?</li>
            <li>The feature that notifies me every 30 seconds and every two minutes how long I&#x27;ve been brushing, by making the brush stutter, is a mild annoyance, and can&#x27;t be turned off.  </li>
            <li>The brush heads wear out a bit quickly, but I also tend to be a long brusher, so I wouldn&#x27;t attribute it to the product.</li>
            <li>New Precision Clean brush heads are a bit larger &amp; really are tailored to the size of the individual tooth.</li>
            <li>Since the design elements on the budget versions are similar to the pro versions and uses the same toothbrush head, I thought the budget Oral B electric toothbrush was just as good as the more expensive Oral-B Pros.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was not at all sure I would want the 30 second brief pause that encourages the user to move on to the next area, but I have found it very helpful and quite unobtrusive in completing an even 2 minutes.  </li>
            <li>My gums look great, my teeth always feel like I just came from the dentist, it stops when you brush too hard, and it gets in every single place!</li>
            <li>you get multiple brush modes (daily clean, sensitive, polish, deep clean), pressure sensors, and even wireless displays.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I like Oral B, and this is a fine model to get, but I found soon after getting it that local retailers had it for the same price or cheaper, and I could also find coupons with some regularity.</li>
            <li>My teeth have never felt so smooth with any other brush.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not as comfortable as other brushes i have used.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t even consider any other product, your teeth are too important to gamble on a &amp;#34;maybe&amp;#34; product.</li>
            <li>Since I didn&#x27;t find the digital info useful and always used the normal mode which was never a problem for my sensitive teeth, I decided to \\&quot;downgrade\\&quot; to the no frills Oral B 1000 model featuring one speed and no display.</li>
            <li>Feels good on the gums, not sure if it&#x27;s making anything better or worse.</li>
            <li>This new model I believe is faster than the older model it replaced, if you have never used a brush like this you may need to go a little easy on pressure to get used to it.</li>
            <li>Frankly, I did not think it would live up to the &amp;#34;hype&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve now used my new one</li>
            <li>so I decided a new one was in order.</li>
            <li>It feels like I have new teeth.  </li>
            <li>(The 1000 model number replaced the 7400 model number which replaced the 3D number, all without any claim of being a new model, but no doubt there have been some updates to it over the years.)    </li>
            <li>But this new model is simpler and just as effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li>Because I threw away the box and the receipt thinking that there would be no problems with the brush since it was brand new, I have no way of returning it to the store.  </li>
            <li>After 5 years of use, I just replaced my toothbrush with a new Oral-B Pro 1000 model.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new to electric toothbrushes</li>
            <li>I bought this toothbrush, new, out of the box.</li>
            <li>It was returned and a new brush was sent out immediately.</li>
            <li>I live in a multi-person house hold</li>
            <li>I have used the new electrical toothbrush for about a month now</li>
            <li>I was astonished with the speed/power of the new toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>so it had been years since I looked for a new toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Was looking for a new electric toothbrush to replace my 5 year Braun unit.  </li>
            <li>so she just bought a new one</li>
            <li>I started searching for a new one.</li>
            <li>With the new Oral-B, I have to recharge it twice a week, which, granted</li>
            <li>I still could easily live with manual brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>He loves the electric toothbrush, and wanted him to have spare brush heads for the new toothbrush.</li>
            <li>so I decided it was time for a new toothbrush.</li>
            <li>my new look....</li>
            <li>yeah, time for a new one.</li>
            <li>When I lucked out and saw a new one of these on eBay for $27.99/free ship (didn&#x27;t wanna hassle with the rebate), I decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li>The disadvantage is I don&#x27;t live in US</li>
            <li>wanted to have a new brush</li>
            <li>Almost cheaper to buy a new unit than to buy a pack of brush replacements</li>
            <li>had to buy a new one.</li>
            <li>The new ones (these)</li>
            <li>For new buyers....  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Finally decided to replace the thing when I saw the price on this new one (plus $15 off from a mfg rebate).</li>
            <li>A new version for $30?</li>
            <li>If this device could be upgraded with a new battery, a superior-quality build would make sense.</li>
            <li>Includes new features explained in the instruction booklet.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll update this review when I&#x27;ve had some experience with the new one.</li>
            <li>This new one is noisy.</li>
            <li>In fact, the Oral-B that I replaced with this new one wasn&#x27;t out of working order ....</li>
            <li>I thought I would replace it with a new one for Christmas.  </li>
            <li>this series instead of just buying new heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Sure, I could set a timer and keep an eye on it, switching to different parts of my mouth as the timer counts down, but this is very convenient.</li>
            <li>Sure, I could set a timer and keep an eye on it, switching to different parts of my mouth as the timer counts down, but this is very convenient.</li>
            <li>As a Prime member was let down with the performance of the product and really had hoped for better back up from Amazon.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a fan of electric toothbrushes, and the battery life on this new Precision 1000 is a few days longer than my old variant, so that&#x27;s ok with me.</li>
            <li>It is easy to handle and takes up less counter space.&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li>What you give up is more features, like UV sterilizing and perhaps additional cleaning modes (like a gentle cycle on your washing machine, some brushes have a mode for delicate users).  </li>
            <li>What you give up is more features, like UV sterilizing and perhaps additional cleaning modes (like a gentle cycle on your washing machine, some brushes have a mode for delicate users).  </li>
            <li>a note - the different heads available can be quite different.  </li>
            <li>just how much pressure is enough and when it is too much.</li>
            <li>really thought these electric tooth brush is really meant for the physically challenged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Am very satisfied and like that other brushes can be interchanged in the unit for other family members.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t understand why anyone would pay 2/3/4 times as much for the same thing from oral-b with additional features.</li>
            <li>A marked improvement over the older Oral-B toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>We bought these to replace older rechargeable tooth brushes and WOW.  </li>
            <li>has a red light to indicate low battery&lt;br</li>
            <li>Decent build quality so far.  </li>
            <li>model seems to have good battery life, at least initially.  </li>
            <li>It does the job and in a nice way without shaking your fillings loose like some other electric toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li>Also I have a fairly large mouth with fairly large teeth, and the tiny heads on this thing made it feel like I was brushing with a bundle of soft toothpicks.</li>
            <li>She got the exact same rejection letter (after sending away the original UPC in a carefully sealed envelope.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Many people prefer the battery operated ones due to the cheaper price, but when you add up the cost of batteries you&#x27;re really losing money in the long run.</li>
            <li>This toothbrush works well; cleans fast and deep, is easy to use and maintain.&lt;br /&gt;The Oral-B Professional \\&quot;Precision 1000\\&quot; is lightweight but powerful.&lt;br /&gt;Being completely waterproof and induction-charged suggests a long product life.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also very loud.</li>
            <li>the unit is very light and the pottery is very heavy.  </li>
            <li>The 1st we received was not working properly and Amazon sent another one with very fast delivery.</li>
            <li>I did not take it on a recent vacation with me and regretted it, very very much.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend the Oral-B Professional Care 1000 Electric Toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend the Oral-B Professional Care 1000 Electric Toothbrush.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very loud, but I hear that that&#x27;s the norm for electric toothbrushes.</li>
            <li>I have a very small mouth, as my dentist will attest, and most of them are too large and my teeth do not get cleaned as well.</li>
            <li>There is only one speed, which is fine because I only used one speed on my old model.</li>
            <li>/&gt;While the brush handle itself is nice and quiet, the brushing heads that come with the brush are a little loud.</li>
            <li>The charge lasts long enough that you can travel with this brush easily.</li>
            <li>I like that it has a timer to tell you when to switch to other areas of your mouth, and having the brush stop if I push too hard it great too.  </li>
            <li>There are stutters to let you know how long you&#x27;ve been brushing, but they&#x27;re easy enough to ignore, and the unit doesn&#x27;t turn itself off.</li>
            <li>It lasts long, easy to maintain, doesn&#x27;t require extensive charging (though the charging does take forever).</li>
            <li>The charge lasts for a long time so short trips can easily be done without the charger.</li>
            <li>but, given that corporate environmental irresponsibility is ubiquitous and typical, I am glad I spent less and still have a good way to take care of the ol&#x27; pearly whites.nd</li>
            <li>but, given that corporate environmental irresponsibility is ubiquitous and typical, I am glad I spent less and still have a good way to take care of the ol&#x27; pearly whites.</li>
            <li>Our second Oral B. First one lasted 6 years - with wife and I using it 2x a day</li>
            <li>Better grip, seems lighter, less likely to activate button by mistake like older model.&lt;br /&gt;3.  </li>
            <li>I replaced that first electric with another from the same brand.  </li>
            <li>Of the six models, I would say that the only ones that I did not like were the low-end Oral-B and the first Interplak.  </li>
            <li>The first lasted for about ten years.</li>
            <li>The first time i used it i felt like i was finally brushing my teeth.</li>
            <li>I lost my first on a recent trip.</li>
            <li>Been using it for a month and no problem so far!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a big fan of the modern electric toothbrush - and so is my dentist!  </li>
            <li>As the toothbrush pulsated after the first 30 seconds to indicate that it should be moved to a different part of the mouth, the brush immediately stopped working.  </li>
            <li>It seemed my first choice, did not vibrate enough.</li>
            <li>As an example, while I do use the normal brush speed, I prefer the sensitive heads because of my gums.  </li>
            <li>have gotten more cavities than I should in the past.  </li>
            <li>I received the replacement and was sent exactly the same thing.  </li>
            <li>I love that it has a small brush head.</li>
            <li>Completely unsanitary!</li>
            <li>Like I mentioned earlier, neither toothbrush is better than the other at cleaning your teeth</li>
            <li>I mentioned earlier, neither toothbrush is better than the other at cleaning your teeth, it&#x27;s just the Oral-b</li>
            <li>With the first use my teeth felt like I just left the dentist.</li>
            <li>After we recieved the replacement we snt the first back prepaid.</li>
            <li>I ordered it online for value as comparable brushes were selling for higher prices in local retail.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The more expensive ones have more bells and whistles, but I still believe they do the SAME job of cleaning the teeth.</li>
            <li>The only thing that you should be aware of is that although it comes with a charger, there is no place to hold the brush attachment.  </li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t that old!  </li>
            <li>I felt like I went from a classy compact car to a luxurious full-size premier sedan!</li>
            <li>and after using it for only a week, I really think I notice my teeth getting whiter!  </li>
            <li>and so far it works!  </li>
            <li>Even though this model is more towards the basic side of features compared to the other models, it&#x27;s all you need for brushing teeth.</li>
            <li>and I used it for the first time last night.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>my first visit back to the dentist after using this toothbrush</li>
            <li>Pretty gross.</li>
            <li>First, I&#x27;ve only had this for a week</li>
            <li>In terms of vibration and noise I find it very quiet, but as i said this is my first electric toothbrush</li>
            <li>The Sonicare head was pretty big</li>
            <li>I personally prefer the smaller, circular brush head of the 1000 to the more traditional linear type of head used by Sonicare.</li>
            <li>I had an old one of these for about 25 years!  </li>
            <li>Toothbrushes from oral B has given the market top notch products over the past years.</li>
            <li>It works just as well as my old brush and was 1/3 the price!</li>
            <li>Resulted in more stain than usual on my teeth.</li>
            <li>This is definitely better than manual brushes as well as the various other electric toothbrushes I have used.</li>
            <li>My first finally bit the dust after 13 years.</li>
            <li>This was a Christmas gift for our 20 year old son and he loves it!  </li>
            <li>Sought a relacement for my previous tooth brush, and this one is just fine.</li>
            <li>Whenever I scale after manual brushing I usually have a notable amount of plaque remaining .</li>
            <li>This is my first electric toothbrush and I can not believe the difference from regular brushing.  </li>
            <li>replacement for my original is a bit slimmer but same basic specs</li>
            <li>I completely disagree!</li>
            <li>Because of the way I use this toothbrush (not all the time) I have not had to replace the heads more than once in the past</li>
            <li>Try the flossing action one if you like the feeling of a jackhammer on your gums!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, this is much better than the inexpensive ones I&#x27;ve had in the past.</li>
            <li>I will tell you that my dentist had recommended a different brand and a higher model in that brand with lots of bells and whistles.</li>
            <li>I bought a higher price model last Christmas and wanted another one but at a cheaper price.  </li>
            <li>Although it didn&#x27;t take long to arrive it was worth the wait.</li>
            <li>The other thing I like is that the charger interface is exactly the same as it was on our original one from 15 years ago.  </li>
            <li>So a good buy as a one-person brush but not ideal for families or couples who share.</li>
            <li>But if more than one person uses it, that really cuts down the use time, and that&#x27;s where the overly long recharge period is an issue.</li>
            <li>As long as it is totally discharge every 6 months it should be fine.  </li>
            <li>The battery lasts a long time, and it does a pretty decent job at getting in between teeth</li>
            <li>I would recommend starting to use a toothbrush like this AFTER getting a thorough cleaning at the dentist, so you&#x27;re essentially starting off with a clean slate.</li>
            <li>My teeth feel just as clean as they did the day of my recent cleaning, whereas with a regular toothbrush I&#x27;d probably already be feeling some buildup.</li>
            <li>I credit this excellent result to moving the brush very slowly for about 2 minutes per quadrant, not the entire job, for a total of 8 minutes, twice daily.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy to report that it works exactly as I expected it to (the single brushing speed is the same as the speed I always used on my old brush) and uses the same replacement brushes.  </li>
            <li>so I know that I&#x27;ve done due diligence in getting my mouth clean.  </li>
            <li>I had other electrical tooth brushes before, but now I can feel the clean power on my teeths after each brush.</li>
            <li>I like that the charger takes up so little space on the bathroom counter, but re-charging time is kind of long.</li>
            <li>This Oral-B Professional Care 1000 Electric Rechargeable Power Toothbrush is  more expensive but definitely works better than my Colgate battery-powered toothbrush.</li>
            <li>since I still have the old Oral-B I use that one while the new one is charging.</li>
            <li>Oral-B toothbrush with their new Professional Care 1000.</li>
            <li>My old Oral-B doesn&#x27;t hold a candle to this new</li>
            <li>Both the old and the new products are made in Germany, which explains why the old one still works as well as it did when it was new.  </li>
            <li>My 20 year old unit broke, my fault, so I bought a new one.</li>
            <li>The new unit is an improvement over the old, as the manufacturer has upgraded and improved it over the years.</li>
            <li>I had to buy this new version because the charger of the old one was damaged and Braun has discontinued that version.</li>
            <li>Since companies can&#x27;t come up with any new ideas, they start to try and complicate old ones to make them seem new.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I just repurchased a new Sonicare with some sensitive head replacements</li>
            <li>The new toothbrush is lighter, cleaner looking and operates just as well as the old.  </li>
            <li>The new one arrived quickly, thank you Amazon Prime, But, after 24 hours it would only run about 15 seconds, I left it on the charger another 24 hours, again 10 or 15 seconds.</li>
            <li>And they&#x27;re quite cheap these days; the [[ASIN:B0002M5JNY Oral-B S-200]] costs significantly less than this one.</li>
            <li>Compact, light with a long lasting battery.</li>
            <li>contents of the box are few and this product is easy to use.</li>
            <li>Easy to use, slim to hold, waterproof to be placed in the bathroom; and it pauses automatically when I press it heavily upon a tooth</li>
            <li>The brush heed snaps on easily &amp; remains firm while brushing.</li>
            <li>As expected is as good if not better than the one purchased 10 years ago.</li>
            <li>- you get plenty of brushing action and &#x27;more&#x27; is not necessarily better.  </li>
            <li>Overall, this is much better than regular toothbrushes, with a really unobtrusive charger, so I won&#x27;t ever be going back to regular brushes.</li>
            <li>This definitely does a great job of cleaning but the biggest setback is the base grows mold fairly quickly and gets pretty gross.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not bad overall, but I would spend some extra $ and get the 5000 model.  </li>
            <li>just like any other brush nothing special.</li>
            <li>The major drawback is that there is a blinking green light that lights a darkened bathroom very well for about 15 minutes after using the machine and placing it on the charger.  </li>
            <li>most things, it comes down to personal tastes, but I found my [[ASIN:B0019ZGU1S</li>
            <li>They seemed to get down into the gumline better than the traditional shaped heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;The very narrow head makes brushing much easier and comfortable to use.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I was surprised by how loud it is!</li>
            <li>- I just had my first dental cleaning after using the Oral B Professional 1000 with the Floss Action brush head for the last four months.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyhow, a few novacaine injections, a wisdom tooth extraction, and a couple hundred bucks later, good folks at the Tooth Spa sent me home drooling like a disoriented monkey and with explicit instructions to purchase one of this gizmos.</li>
            <li>review--&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used a manual toothbrush for at least the past 10 years, but was looking for a cheap and effective electric one, since I always read about the benefits of them.</li>
            <li>I bought a new Oral B \\&quot;Professional Care 1000\\&quot; electric toothbrush and threw away my old electric toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>I brush well anyway, and floss twice daily, but this thing brings tooth brushing to a whole new level.</li>
            <li>It uses the same model of brush head but this model cleans more aggressively than the previous one.  </li>
            <li>I actually spend less time brushing now and get better results.  </li>
            <li>Cleans better and faster than a regular toothbrush with less effort.</li>
            <li>Luckily, it fits the same charger and the same replacement heads!</li>
            <li>This brush made my entire head vibrate like a jack hammer, was very loud, and gave me VERY SORE gums after just one use.</li>
            <li>My previous models had a backing so at least it felt more secure.</li>
            <li>Expected the same smooth action from a new brush</li>
            <li>The only drawback I have heard of is the size of the brush head not being as large as some</li>
            <li>Have had it only a few weeks but works great and half the price of my old one which was just like this one.  </li>
            <li>It occurred to me that if my dentists have always used small round rotating brushes (vs. any other motion), then that must be what&#x27;s best</li>
            <li>The recharge light is a little obtrusive in that it blinks instead of just a stead glow.  </li>
            <li>powerful cleaning, and a battery that lasts for days on a single charge!</li>
            <li>The older one was getting dirty and too slow but this one is very strong and easy to keep clean.</li>
            <li>Brush is okay, but the head it comes with needs to be a little bigger.</li>
            <li>I love how clean it leaves my mouth feeling: if I go away and have to use an ordinary toothbrush for even a few days I find myself delighting in the dental-cleaning-clean feeling I get when I come home to my trusty electric.</li>
            <li>I only have had the electric toothbrushes that you buy from your regular pharmacy type store but this is on a much higher caliber!</li>
            <li>Will shop a little more thoroughly next time.</li>
            <li>I suppose I will use it for a while but will eventually shell out a little more and get the next version up.</li>
            <li>Will do a little more research next time.</li>
            <li>It seems to rattle a little more than my last Oral-B&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and I love that there is a &#x27;warning signal&#x27; if I am pushing too hard, which can hurt your gums.</li>
            <li>It works ok, but the on-off button is hard to locate when you&#x27;re brushing.  </li>
            <li>in all, it would be hard to find a better electric toothbrush at anywhere close to this price.</li>
            <li>It also probably does a better job without brushing too hard.  </li>
            <li>I have owned several of these over time model has changed and gotten better, you certainly dont need anything mero complex than this.</li>
            <li>it works well, and I don&#x27;t find it to be super loud the way some other people mentioned.</li>
            <li>The Oral-b&#x27;s head is specifically designed to be round and small allowing users to clean each individual tooth while the structural design allow for simple and easy clean up.</li>
            <li>Neither will shaking the brush head vigorously clear all of it.</li>
            <li>The old one had simply worn out, he used it so much.</li>
            <li>: To clarify, there isn&#x27;t much point in reviewing the heads themselves because Oral-B offers several varieties.</li>
            <li>My 10 year old Oral-B started making a harsh sound when brushing.  </li>
            <li>my opinion, based on my experience, you should be pleasantly surprised if any of these electric brushes (of at least the 1000 and 3000 models) lasts more than a year.  </li>
            <li>In my opinion, based on my experience, you should be pleasantly surprised if any of these electric brushes (of at least the 1000 and 3000 models) lasts more than a year.  </li>
            <li>Steer clear.</li>
            <li>The image of the product clearly has a toothbrush head storage compartment attached to the charging unit.  </li>
            <li>So much less pressure on my gums, and my teeth still feel clean.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s half the price and way easier to clean.</li>
            <li>What I like about this type of loud is that it&#x27;s a low-pitched hum - like a really quiet biplane (haha,</li>
            <li>how unbelievably LOUD it is.</li>
            <li>It may not have all the bells and whistles, but it has (as far as I can tell anyway) all the performance.</li>
            <li>One feature this has that my old one didn&#x27;t is that when it is close to being in need of charge</li>
            <li>I replaced my old Oral B Vitality toothbrush with this</li>
            <li>It was old and getting louder and louder</li>
            <li>So far I haven&#x27;t even taken this one out of the box.</li>
            <li>Depending on your daily use, it can go about a week with the low battery red light comes on.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Well, I am just about to return the Oral B professional care</li>
            <li>This replaced a 10-year old Braun/Oral-B electric toothbrush.  </li>

            <li>and also had 2 additional modes of sensitive and polish.</li>
            <li>The Oral-B 1000 is the entry level of the Professional Care</li>
            <li>/&gt;Do note that the Professional Care 1000&#x27;s specifications indicate the presence of a pressure sensor.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive gums and did not find this brush head to be too abrasive.</li>

            <li>Replaced an old (10+ years)</li>
            <li>What an improvement over the old one.  </li>
            <li>At first, I took advantage of the feature of the 1000 model that lets you know how long you&#x27;re supposed to brush each quadrant of your mouth.</li>
            <li>and I decided to try Oral B Sonic Action after Oral B Professional 1000,&lt;br /&gt;because</li>
            <li>Definitely recommend the product to all who so ever wants to buy a Electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I replaced my Sonicare electric toothbrush with this one because I wanted one with replacement heads with soft bristles.  </li>
            <li>The charging light is green and flashes when being charged.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worked well so far, got compliments from my dentist.</li>
            <li>the blinking green light doesn&#x27;t bother me.</li>

            <li>I recommend using the floss action brush head.</li>

            <li>My dental hygienist recommended this for my 6 and 9 year old kids.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Notes: If you&#x27;re using an electric toothbrush for the first time or after a long time, your gums will probably bleed.</li>
            <li>I like the old Oral-b that would pulse to let you know that the two minutes were up.  </li>
            <li>The 30 second timer for each part of your mouth is very helpful.</li>
            <li>Yes it is loud</li>

            <li>I&#x27;d worn out 2 Braun Professional Care(#?</li>

            <li>well, simply and fast.</li>
            <li>as far as cleaning, it&#x27;s a 5 star product.</li>
            <li>it is loud.</li>
            <li>Now I am even surprised that I used to brush with that for 4 years!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>one is marked as \\&quot;Made in Germany.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had an oral b professional 3000 or 5000.  </li>
            <li>I was upset that they stopped making replacement brushes for my old one just three years into ownership.  </li>
            <li>I have always had a Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush and when my old one needed replacing</li>
            <li>Seems to work well so far.  </li>
            <li>Also fits on the old charger which has a 4 brush storage.</li>
            <li>but it is twice as often as with my old elec.</li>
            <li>From full charge I usually get about 5 days (twice daily) brushing, then red light will flash.  </li>
            <li>of my unexpected pleasures of the Oral-B 1000 Pro toothbrush is the built in timers.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m assuming it does something like clear the memory on the battery when you allow it to go completely dead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I personally feel the chemicals in pastes and rinses that say &#x27;tartar-control&#x27; really work,</li>
            <li>I personally feel the chemicals in pastes and rinses that say &#x27;tartar-control&#x27; really work,</li>
            <li>So far this electric toothbrush machine has been holding up well.</li>
            <li>; loud.</li>
            <li>Feels almost like the professional cleaning at the dentist, without the bill.</li>
            <li>Really like the 30 second timer.</li>
            <li>The smallish brush makes cleaning the far teeth easier.</li>
            <li>SO FAR SO GO  OD</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t think this brush works nearly as well as the oral b brush I had been using.</li>
            <li>thing I am not a fan of is how loud it is, I have never used an electric toothbrush</li>
            <li>so they all be this loud</li>
            <li>Bought this to replace an old one.  </li>
            <li>I actually brush for a whole two minutes thanks to the 30 second reminder function (yes, as an adult I didn&#x27;t brush for 2 minutes).</li>
            <li>Makes your teeth feel like you just had a professional cleaning.</li>
            <li>but so far I would buy it again</li>
            <li>replacement for the old one</li>
            <li>/&gt;It also had a gum setting, sensitive area setting and polish settings.</li>
            <li>Far exceeds my old Phillips sonic brush.</li>
            <li>But having used the brush for about a week now, I like knowing when my quarter-mouth 30-sec period is complete</li>
            <li>My old tooth brush broke</li>
            <li>My brother has had his for about 10 years so far.</li>
            <li>Let me begin with mentiong that i have sensitive gums.</li>
            <li>Using the oral b sensitive heads.</li>
            <li>So wow, what a difference when I got this one.  </li>
            <li>But I was surprised as the design of this head feels like it cups each tooth while doing its job</li>
            <li>I use it twice a day, it cleans the enamel off the plaque which generally takes a lot of effort while using a normal toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I like the timer which the my old one also had</li>
            <li>I picked this model because I wanted to try the Floss Action head, and it was a step up from Vitality which moves at about 1/4 of the speed of this one.</li>
            <li>It comes with 1 Precision head, but there was a $3 coupon enclosed, and the Floss Action heads were on sale at Walgreen&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>So I end up having to hit those manually with my old Cybersonic head.</li>
            <li>So I end up having to hit those manually with my old Cybersonic head.</li>
            <li>I got this for my 10 year old.  </li>
            <li>wow..</li>
            <li>Had a sonicare and did not like the brushing action or the cleaning involved with the toothbrush.</li>
            <li>The motor is not too loud and they&#x27;ve improved the timing mechanism so that it tells you every 30 seconds when to start brushing another area.  </li>
            <li>This unit has a rougher vibration and, in my opinion, is too fast for proper cleaning.</li>
            <li>I bought the sensitive gums head</li>
            <li>The vibrating and pulsing action massages the gums, and ensures that the bristles get in between your teeth, working to remove plaque buildup.</li>
            <li>This was a replacement for a 10 year old Oral-B.</li>
            <li>The directions say you can leave it plugged in, but that&#x27;s what I did with my old Sonicare and the battery</li>
            <li>After using the electric toothbrush for several months, I find that I really like it</li>
            <li>this replaced an oral-b nine years old</li>
            <li>I feel like my teeth are much cleaner than they were with a regular toothbrush</li>
            <li>my old one quite on me&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
            <li>gave me the needed cleanse and care that my sensitive teeth deserves.</li>
            <li>My old Oral-B toothbrush died after 7 years, so I decided to go with this one.  </li>
            <li>Has a lot of power, might switch to the sensitive heads as I have sensitive gums</li>
            <li>It is not the complete Oral B package that one purchases</li>
            <li>Her old one (Sonicare) died, and we decided to try an Oral-B.  </li>
            <li>All that is really needed is the final &#x27;reminder&#x27; pause at the end of 2 minutes.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not as loud as the one I tossed in the garbage, and it feels like it&#x27;s cleaning my teeth.</li>
            <li>When our old Oral-B toothbrush wore out after 10+ years, my husband and I realized Oral-B was the brand for us.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After I had my buckles fixed my gums</li>
            <li>This was a gift for my husband and so far he says he loves it.</li>
            <li>I nearly always have to take it out while it&#x27;s still running to locate the button.</li>
            <li>This brush is about 50% quieter than the old one, and spins faster.</li>
            <li>Item was shipped fast and takes brushing to the next level.</li>
            <li>I just replaced an old Oral B toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>One thing I don&#x27;t like is the brush got soft too soon, 1 week, and it doesn&#x27;t have the two speeds as advertised.  </li>
            <li>I really like the 30 second intervals.  </li>
            <li>Needs to be cleaned nearly every day.</li>
            <li>It has a very indiscreet &amp;#34;skip&amp;#34; in the vibration every 30 seconds, with a &amp;#34;double skip&amp;#34; at two minutes to help you ensure a proper brushing time.  </li>
            <li>(I like the old charger because it has a brush-head holder attached).</li>
            <li>Had to replace my old, worn out Oral-B toothbrush</li>
            <li>I really like the 30 second timer for each quadrant</li>
            <li>Works well and direct replacement for another one I had that is now having battery issues.</li>
            <li>My teeth &amp;#34;almost&amp;#34; felt young again.</li>
            <li>(I bought the soft heads, bc</li>
            <li>My oral surgeon recommended using the Oral B Professional electronic toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>This unit has improvements and additional features from the old one.</li>
            <li>Feels like you havejust had your teeth cleansed professionally.  </li>
            <li>Oral B Professional Care 1000 Electric Toothbrush.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It reaches places I could not reach with my old tooth brush.</li>
            <li>They said these were loud and vibrated a lot</li>
            <li>We really didn&#x27;t use the fancy display on all of the others we&#x27;ve had and found this one works the same as the fancy versions.</li>
            <li>old son needed his toothbrush replace, we decided to get him an Oral B, too.  </li>
            <li>I bought this brush after my old Oral-B went to Tooth Fairy heaven.</li>
            <li>\\&quot;I got a professional electric toothbrush,\\</li>
            <li>I think the old models were dual voltage.</li>
            <li>My son is sensitive to vibration and he tolerates and loves this brush.</li>
            <li>The reason for purchasing this toothbrush is that dentist recommend a circular brush action which my old brush did not have.  </li>
            <li>this was a replacement product as my old one died.</li>
            <li>She loves it so much that I have to limit her to only using it twice a day!!</li>
            <li>It gets my teeth cleaner than the old model did.</li>
            <li>I really like that after 30 seconds it has a different vibration</li>
            <li>It so far is working well, as I was hoping.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had an old oral b toothbrush.</li>
            <li>This is a replacement for  a 7 year old model.  </li>
            <li>WOW People treat yourself to an electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I have the Sonicare and didn&#x27;t like how gunk would go into the brush head requiring considerable cleaning weekly.  </li>
            <li>I like the brushing action.</li>
            <li>old one lasted forever.</li>
            <li>Keeps my teeth much cleaner than standard brushing</li>
            <li>so I had to order the Sensitive toothbrush replacements.  </li>
            <li>Now I have to switch out the brushes for sensitive areas and tougher areas like my built in retainer and tongue.  </li>
            <li>Toothbrush is well built and not too loud.</li>
            <li>I have a sonic toothbrush that I really like, but a year ago I found that I needed a second toothbrush to keep at the office and throw in my case for those away from home trips.  </li>
            <li>Needed a replacement as our 25+ yr old Oral-B died.</li>
            <li>I use it with the soft head refills.</li>
            <li>Works well, reasonably priced, does not come with case or extra brush heads or anything to store brush</li>
            <li>THE OLD FASHION WAY OF BRUSHING TEETH</li>
            <li>I will see how it really does at my next checkup.with the dentist.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had any problems so far.</li>
            <li>i needed to replace my old &amp;#34;Vitality&amp;#34; model (had it for 8 years)</li>
            <li>This was bought as an update for an old Oral-B toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>When I saw there was a professional model that was affordable</li>
            <li>I would recommend the the Oral B Professional to anyone who likes electrib brushes.  </li>
            <li>My teeth feel so much cleaner after brushing, though I don&#x27;t know if they actually are.</li>
            <li>In terms of charging it, it will take about 24 hours for the green light to stop flashing.</li>
            <li>noticeable difference vs old toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I thought it might come with a sensitive speed, too, but not in this model.</li>
            <li>can only speculate that the slime is generated by the moisture trapped in the many parts within the brush</li>
            <li>The charger is really small and tucks away nicely and the toothbrush holds a really long charge.</li>
            <li>, so I guess I shouldn&#x27;t have expected it to be as powerful.</li>
            <li>I bought the 5000 model for myself and while the 5000 model has a few more features including the display unit ( which never worked properly for me</li>
            <li>While I&#x27;ve only been using it for a few weeks, my family and I LOVE this thing.  </li>
            <li>and that is just scary-as in scary good</li>
            <li>and that is just scary-as in scary good performance.    </li>
            <li>The instructions say that you can leave the toothbrush off the charger for up to a week, but I&#x27;ve noticed the motor runs more slowly if I leave it off the charger for even a day.</li>
            <li>Double A battery ones slowly die and becomeless effective.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I will say that I loved the UV base on my older toothbrush, but replacement brushes were nowhere near as easy to come by whereas with this one I can find them in just about any pharmacy, supermarket or big box chain</li>
            <li>Works good but replacement heads so expensive.</li>
            <li>I bought this to replace an electric toothbrush I had for many years that was slowly dying.  </li>
            <li>but it had an LED screen in the handle which was kind of unnecessary, caused it to be bulky, and I think it also ate up power.&lt;br</li>
            <li>this brush is a strong little machine!</li>
            <li>Then I just keep using for few more days to totally run battery down before charging full.</li>
            <li>This answers my desire for a toothbrush that is easy to use,takes little room on my counter-top and is easily rinsed, towel dried and replaced in short order...</li>
            <li>It lacks the different modes and it is less powerful than the higher models.</li>
            <li>This machine runs at a higher speed than the previous model, which attribute I don&#x27;t really understand.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s footprint is tiny - about a square inch, and the cord is super long.</li>
            <li>In my opinion this is the better of the two Oral-B and the other more expensive Sonicare.</li>
            <li>the voltage is not fit for my country ，but the other side is good enough for me</li>
            <li>Also, the neck of the brush is bigger than others and I find toothpaste easily runs down the brush when brushing</li>
            <li>The handle part is slimmer than in the past and is easy to move around the mouth.</li>
            <li>I started using the first one on a consistent basis  for the last few months--ie-- brushing for exactly 2 minutes (30 seconds per quadrant) using the stutter reminder and guess what, my dental checkup came back flying colors, almost no plague.  </li>
            <li>It is fast and does the job much quicker than the other one I have.  </li>
            <li>Simple, straightforward, single-speed device; works just as expected.</li>
            <li>The charger is small and easy to use.</li>
            <li>and I was due for a new one as the old one didn&#x27;t seem to be holding charge very well anymore!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Every thirty seconds, a timer in the brush causes the brush to &#x60;stutter&#x27; in several pulses that tells you to go on to the next section of your teeth and gums, if you&#x27;re interrupted, you can turn the brush off and it will continue the cleaning program from where it left off so long as it isn&#x27;t turned off for more than thirty seconds at a time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>These brushes along with the motor clean teeth so well, that my dentist is always amazed by how little plaque I have.</li>
            <li>It also vibrates very quickly and you only need to plug the charger in when you are recharging - not all the time as I did with my previous one.  </li>
            <li>Very easy to use, long lasting on a single charge, Oral B Pro does a terrific job!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The only time I ever used the low speed on the Sonic Complete was when I first started using it</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with the smaller base size which frees up more cabinet space.</li>
            <li>I have only used this a short time but so far this unit is much better than my previous Oral B 1000.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend buying the extra soft bristles, before I got this electric toothbrush</li>
            <li>I especially like the feature where it has a special pulse every 30 sec</li>
            <li>I already have this particular product, so ordered this one for a Christmas present from Amazon.  </li>
            <li>I finally decided I didn&#x27;t want to add the higher end complexity to my oral hygene or pay the extra money.  </li>
            <li>I used an older model and upgraded to the current model.  </li>
            <li>Had to replace and older Oral-B electric toothbrush that finally died and</li>
            <li>It also seems to get my teeth cleaner than an older earlier version Oral-B that I needed to replace.  </li>
            <li>The only thing that i don&#x27;t like is that the brush head is small and i need to reapply toothpaste between doing the top set and bottom.</li>
            <li>I corrected it by putting a small piece of aluminum foil over the light and it blocks it completely and the foil is &amp;#34;water-proof&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>Replacement for similar older model.  </li>
            <li>If it last as long well worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;Does</li>
            <li>, my hygienist asked if i had been doing things differently because my teeth and gums looked better than usual.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the older model of this same toothbrush for years</li>
            <li>This is my first electric tooth brush and likely not my last.</li>
            <li>Overall decent product.</li>
            <li>Small size gets in to more spaces than larger sized brushes.</li>
            <li>I like the 30 second interval signals which encourage me to be consistent in brushing the different sections of my teeth.  </li>
            <li>The first one was one of the more expensive models.</li>
            <li>definitely don&#x27;t need the extra features offered in the higher end versions.</li>
            <li>Bought this to replace an older model that finally bit the dust.  </li>
            <li>I bought this to replace an older version of the same brand and price point.  </li>
            <li>same EXACT story has happened to a friend of mine who recently purchased this toothbrush.</li>
            <li>every thirty seconds, which I find useful because I often didn&#x27;t spend long enough before.</li>
            <li>I definitely noticed that the rotating brush was an improvement on my older Oral-B</li>
            <li>I am a big fan of oral-b toothbrushes, but everyone should be aware that the chargers are quite likely to quit working within a year.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have a timer like I was hoping for but it gets the job done other wise and its very small</li>
            <li>Compared to the Philips brand that my wife had before, this one takes a little bit longer to charge the battery and the brushing power is not as strong and no option for different settings.  </li>
            <li>If the old one is any indicator of the new one&#x27;s durability, then I should be using my new one for a LONG time.  </li>
            <li>I have never felt such a clean other than getting my 6 month check up at my dentist.</li>
            <li>The other reviewer was right: this thing is like a jack-hammer.</li>
            <li>Even after purchasing the SonicSeal, which I highly suggest to anyone who has the Elite/Essence model, mold would still build up at the bottom of the SonicSeal/Sonicare handle without proper cleaning.</li>
            <li>one.&lt;br /&gt;It operates on a very high speed and also holds its&#x27; charge for a long time too.</li>
            <li>However not much later, Oral-B came out with their first \\&quot;SmartSeries\\&quot; which has a special sensor that monitors if the user is pressing too hard on the teeth--this is indicated by reading the signals on an LCD display.</li>
            <li>I needed a new rechargeable toothbrush since my old oral B finally died.</li>
            <li>My old one died after several yrs and needed a new one.</li>
            <li>heads are available from both the company and generic (so hidden cost of the heads can be reduced if you shop</li>
            <li>great product, i bought some for my family members, compare to the expensive pro 5000 or pro 7000, it has the same effect, the only daily clean mode can satisfy one&#x27;s normal use already, i have pro 5000 also, but i only use the daily clean mode everyday, so if i can make the decision again, i will buy this pro 1000 for myself directly, i will not pay extra money for the different modes that i do not need.</li>
            <li>I like that it pulsates every 30 seconds and a special pattern at 2 minutes to let you know when you&#x27;ve brushed long enough.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very careful to dry the entire toothbrush every time I use it, but within a couple of days, a brown burnt gunk starts forming on the charger surface (the part that the toothbrush sits on) and every day there&#x27;s more until I scrape it off and start over again.</li>
            <li>very well--charging takes a bit long but plug it in overnight</li>
            <li>I hope this toothbrush lasts as many years as the one it replaced, which was at least ten years old.</li>
            <li>so you know how long to brush each quarter section of your teeth, very helpful.</li>
            <li>i wish i had bought one a long time ago thanks for agreat product</li>
            <li>Charges fast and lasts a long time&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>long before the charge starts dropping off fast.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m finding it to be just as capable as their far more expensive 5000 series.</li>
            <li>I really like that the battery stays charged for so long.</li>
            <li>It takes a long time to charge, but otherwise it seems to work real well.</li>
            <li>My teeth feel much cleaner after using this, and the charge lasts for a long time before I have to recharge.</li>
            <li>Properly used, these toothbrushes clean your teeth in all the hard to reach places (smaller brush head), and when gently held at a 45 degree angle near the base of the tooth, are excellent for removing the tartar that collects near the gum.  </li>
            <li>it is definitely easier on the arm than normal brushing, although I am somewhat anal when it comes to brushing...</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t go back to a normal toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>I have no negative comments, works well and quietly with vibrating alerts for every 30 seconds of brush time.</li>
            <li>So far this toothbrush has yet to fail them and they all love it!</li>
            <li>Note that the cheapest model that can use a 3D brush head works just as well as the most expensive model, which just has a few more bells and whistles on the timer and display.</li>
            <li>In contrast to other rechargeable electric toothbrushes, the Oral-B has a smaller, round head which more readily allows it to access ALL areas of my teeth.  </li>
            <li>a little sluggish if you press to hard but does a good job if you take your time</li>
            <li>/&gt;Packaging is also  typical for Amazon - First Rate!</li>
            <li>When my old Oral-B electric toothbrush died, I had to order a new one ASAP because brushing with a regular toothbrush left my teeth feeling less than clean.  </li>
            <li>I think electric wins hands down.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the investment, hands down.</li>
            <li>/&gt;There&#x27;s a big difference in thinking you&#x27;ve done the proper amount of brushing time and ACTUALLY doing the right amount of brushing time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>One speed and stops when you push hard so this brush is definitely easy to use.  </li>
            <li>I found that simply hitting the &#x27;on&#x27; button as many times as I could as I went by, I was able to get it down to truly dead, but it generally requires using the bush manually for a day or so, until it is completely dead</li>

            <li>I have to clean the brush regularly because excess toothpaste foam drips down the brush and hardens, but I imagine that&#x27;s an issue with any electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li>You can spend more to get less from other products.  </li>
            <li>When I had to use a regular toothbrush, I couldn&#x27;t wait until my new one arrived.  </li>
            <li>I had an oral B several years ago till it wore out; then bought a Phillips Sonicare at the recommendation of my new dentist.</li>
            <li>Had to buy a new one because my last one died after 6 years of continued use.  </li>
            <li>I have been using the same one for 10 years, never needed to buy a new one.  </li>
            <li>the earlier model was when it was new.  </li>
            <li>I bought this new brush because I had a surplus of toothbrush heads for a similar model that broke after 5 years of use.</li>
            <li>So when my last one died I decided to, of course, buy a new one.</li>
            <li>After using the same electric toothbrush for almost 10 years (a Braun 3D), the batteries just couldn&#x27;t keep charged &amp; it was time for a new one.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve used Oral-B for years, accidentally left the charger in Florida so had to order two new ones.</li>
            <li>I always had to awkwardly position the brush to clean the inside of my teeth, the outer portion is really easy though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>She told me her Dental Hygienist commented that there was less plaque to clean off and asked if she was doing anything different.</li>
            <li>since it doesn&#x27;t seem to stop any action no matter how much pressure I exert on it, I worry it is too rough on my teeth.</li>
            <li>since it doesn&#x27;t seem to stop any action no matter how much pressure I exert on it, I worry it is too rough on my teeth.</li>
            <li>Hopefully, it was last as long as my first one.</li>
            <li>1000.&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s enough vibrating to message and (with the soft brushes \\&quot;Oral-B Sensitive [</li>
            <li>It could be that I am just used to the strength and feel of Sonicare, but this brush is quite a bit less powerful.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Plaque gone, slight gum bleeding gone, dentist fresh vibe after each brushing,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It does need to be recharged after a few days of use (the red light flashes on the device), however, I do brush for a lengthy time each time I use it.  </li>
            <li>only wish I have is the charger (which is really compact) can be used internationally (</li>
            <li>This works pretty well, but not brushing long enough was never a problem for me.</li>
            <li>My old one is over 15 years old, and actually still works.  </li>
            <li>Only gripe is the blinking green light when charging, because the vanity area and outlet are inside my bedroom, so it lights up in the night.</li>
            <li>Only drawback is a 22-hour charge time from bottom to top, and a recommendation to fully discharge the battery at least every 6 months to preserve the rechargeable battery.  </li>
            <li>That protrusion totally prevents me from getting the bristles to the chewing area of my back teeth, which really pisses me off, because I like to be thorough.</li>
            <li>That protrusion totally prevents me from getting the bristles to the chewing area of my back teeth, which really pisses me off, because I like to be thorough.</li>
            <li>The footprint of the actual charging station is tiny, so it doesn&#x27;t take up too much room on my bathroom counter.  </li>
            <li>I unplug the charger when I&#x27;m not actively charging the brush.</li>
            <li>I looked online for a replacement, and decided to go for this earlier model because my husband has a newer and fancier model (with a timer, battery indicator, etc), but it doesn&#x27;t really feel very different.</li>
            <li>The only downside is that the rotation tends to stop a second if too much pressure is put on the brush.</li>
            <li>Noisy, difficult to make sure you are getting the whole tooth surface.  </li>
            <li>though I had more cons than pros, don&#x27;t get me wrong, I still really like this toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Very basic, no timer, does not pulse, very load, and battery time is very short.  </li>
            <li>as good as the expensive if you dont need extra lights and bells literally.</li>
            <li>really don&#x27;t feel that I miss the features of the more expensive one.</li>
            <li>Battery lasts quite a while between charges, and I like the small roundness of the brush head, good for reaching small areas.  </li>
            <li>I tried the battery powered one a few years ago and tossed in quickly.  </li>
            <li>It would have been a wiser decision to charge a dollar or two more and provide a better charging base.  </li>
            <li>No need to buy a whole kit, this came as a single brush</li>
            <li>fast forward to every single dental visit since I switched to this Oral-B brush</li>
            <li>The brush is just right (a little stiff) and my mouth feels clean, once finished.</li>
            <li>but I promise to properly dispose of the old toothbrush!  </li>
            <li>Terrific product so far!</li>
            <li>No other toothbrush shape comes close.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I never knew why I couldn&#x27;t get all the white off my tongue with a regular toothbrush, this Oral-B removed all the white the first time!&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li>Like this toothbrush just fine except - the on/off button is hard to locate while you&#x27;ve got the toothbrush in your mouth.</li>
            <li>No other comparison</li>
            <li>This is my first electric toothbrush and after a few days I can tell that it will get my teeth much cleaner than a regular brush.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>This is the first electric toothbrush I have ever owned, so I cannot compare it to other products.  </li>
            <li>made me little dissy at first, no joke!</li>
            <li>I thought that it would have the feature to slow the brush down for a more gentle cleaning but this model doesn&#x27;t have it.</li>
            <li>I think it might be slightly too powerful, but I&#x27;d rather go a little over the top than not powerful</li>
            <li>Pros: small footprint, makes mouth feel clean.</li>
            <li>would recommend replacing the default toothbrush head provided (small circle) to the dual clean head.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like going to the dentist to get them clean everyday and that&#x27;s just fantastcic!</li>
            <li>a small head has a lot of power in it as well leaves mouth felling clean and refreshed.</li>
            <li>Wife has the 5000 and it cost a few times more, and we don&#x27;t care for the added features like bluetooth or use the other modes.</li>
            <li>The battery is now starting to need to be recharged noticeably more often now, so expect the life of one of these to last 3-4 years, which might not be as long as you expected it to last.</li>
            <li>It is very user friendly, and doesn&#x27;t have unnecessary add-ons.  </li>
            <li>She said that I needed it because I still have my wisdom teeth and a conventional tooth brush will not reach back far enough to adequately brush them.  </li>
            <li>Unlike the Vitality model it does not start slowing down before it dies completely, so if you travel regularly for more than a few days I recommend charging it completely before you leave.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Previous versions from other makers have been hard to keep clean, taken up more room and didn&#x27;t work quite as well.</li>
            <li>Never sure one better than the other, but like the action of this unit.  </li>
            <li>I only use it when I cannot clean some spots which are hard to reach using normal toothbrushes.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s sleek and clean looking but it has a slow grind rather than the old one which had 2 speeds.</li>
            <li>the basic model with only 2 settings High and off</li>
            <li>Expected a little larger head, but love everything else about it.</li>
            <li>Definitely noticed a brighter smile in comparison to using conventional toothbrushes.</li>
            <li>I had a previous version of this brush from around 2003-2004, and it was still going strong...except the brush heads started to fit loosely</li>
            <li>Had a variety of OralB toothbrushes over the years and my general opinion is they are not what they used to</li>
            <li>It really doesn&#x27;t take much toothpaste at all for this small head.</li>
            <li>The head is smaller than my Spinbrush, this is important to me because I have a small mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I generally buy extra soft bristles for my manual toothbrushes</li>
            <li>When I finally got around to opening this product when my old Oral B sonic toothbrush died, I couldn&#x27;t believe:&lt;br /&gt;(1)</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not heavy enough to resist the force of the power cord pushing against it.  </li>
            <li>simply because it has a battery indicator and the word Professional in its name.</li>
            <li>only misgivings so far apart from cost</li>
            <li>It seems to still have a lot of power left when that starts happening, enough I&#x27;ve found to go for a couple more days at least.  </li>
            <li>My old one finally bit the dust after about 7 years of use.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like getting a professional cleaning daily.</li>
            <li>decided to go back to the brushing (twirling clock, counter clock) of the Professional</li>
            <li>far as the brush goes it suppoed to occulate and vibrate it only occulates</li>
            <li>The power action is constantly pushing the toothpaste/saliva out of my mouth</li>
            <li>The Professional Care 1000 is very similar to the 3D Excel.  </li>
            <li>I was surprised that it actually made my teeth noticeably whiter after about 2 weeks.</li>
            <li>and we really wanted that feature and expected it to store all of our brush heads.</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;d say it does an equivalent job to prior.  </li>
            <li>I sent this back, postage was $Aud30.00, and asked for a replacement and stating that I needed a 220 volt Oral B Professional Care 1000 Electric rechargeable power toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>My old oral B finally quit working</li>
            <li>Would definitely recommend the Oral-B Professional.</li>
            <li>I bought this brush to replace a similar Professional Care model that lasted over 7 years of twice a day use.  </li>
            <li>so far I&#x27;ve only used the precision head which I do like...</li>
            <li>I ordered some extra brushes and my 5 yr old loves to use &#x27;daddy&#x27;s tooth brush now.</li>
            <li>My 5 year old model finally gave up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The Oral-B Professional Care 1000 toothbrushes that are sold in North America will have the 8,800 oscillations per minute but only 20,000 pulsations per minute&#x27;.</li>
            <li>My last Braun was 10 years old</li>
            <li>Going in with your expectations set low will most likely save you some of the frustration we&#x27;ve had with our several these past couple months.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Going in with your expectations set low will most likely save you some of the frustration we&#x27;ve had with our several these past couple months.  </li>
            <li>Purchased this brush to replace our old electric toothbrush, that after 4 years finally went up.</li>
            <li>My old Oral-B finally died.</li>
            <li>My old battery operated toothbrush finally quit on me.</li>
            <li>, I followed the instructions in the package of my last rechargeable to allow the battery to completely drain every three months or so.  </li>
            <li>; loud, but definitely &amp;#34;hey guys, guess who&#x27;s brushing their teeth in the bathroom!&amp;#34</li>
            <li>my dentist was always telling me to brush softer with extra soft bristles.</li>
            <li>I also bought a 3-pack of the floss action brush heads for future use.</li>
            <li>So far, I&#x27;ve used the included standard brush head with my 1000 brush for about a week.</li>
            <li>Smaller brush makes getting back side of back teeth much easier.</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;ve gotten this toothbrush for 3 different people as gifts.</li>
            <li>I have to hold the handle upside-down and almost completely vertical, and hit those from above.</li>
            <li>I have to hold the handle upside-down and almost completely vertical, and hit those from above.</li>
            <li>I can still remember the epic difference between my regular toothbrush and this.</li>
            <li>My dentist had recommended I get an electric toothbrush since my brushing skills apparently suck.</li>
            <li>My dentist always comments how I barely have any plaque since using this product.  </li>
            <li>Definitely an upgrade from the old toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>You should go back to honoring price drops since it pisses off customers like me who frequently makes purchases on Amazon.</li>
            <li>It has 3 brush settings apparently</li>
            <li>The only caveat with this Oral-B is that you need to be conscious of using on each tooth.  </li>
            <li>are soft enough to make me think they&#x27;re cleaning under the gumline and not damaging my enamel.  </li>
            <li>Ordered this to replace my old Oral-B that was finally failing after 8 years!</li>
            <li>My old brush only signaled after 2minutes were up.</li>
            <li>I love the feature that tells me when I have brushed long enough on each quadrant and also tells you when you have brushed long enough overall.</li>
            <li>The cleaning action is a combination of a rotating brush that vibrates at the same time.  </li>
            <li>It does have the 30 second alert, which I did like in my old one.</li>
            <li>220V charging can be directly used in China, it can not converter, personally tested.</li>
            <li>and I have no regrets.</li>
            <li>The only weakness that I&#x27;ve noted thus far is the lack of a brush head cover.</li>
            <li>I owned the Oral B Professional Care 5000 series for years and it finally died...</li>
            <li>We tried a cheaper generic store version of brush heads but were so unimpressed that we ordered the oral b floss action heads within a week.  </li>
            <li>I bought this item when my old one -- also Oral-B -- finally died.  </li>
            <li>Every several months you should completely discharge the battery then recharge it according to the instructions.</li>
            <li>This is the 2nd oral b professional toothbrush I have had</li>
            <li>But the biggest problem is the bristles are barely longer than the length of the head of the toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>i&#x27;m going to try the different head for it for sensitive gums but that could just be me.</li>
            <li>Every time I use it, I feel like I&#x27;ve just had a proper cleaning from the dentist, and don&#x27;t think I ever want to go back to using a normal toothbrush.</li>
            <li>This is a great toothbrush, though the timer can be a bit annoying if you&#x27;re a person who normally brushes their teeth longer than 2 minutes, though it doesn&#x27;t interfere with brushing.</li>
            <li>better way to stand behind your product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love the product, not happy with the rebate.</li>
            <li>The smaller head is especially useful for brushing behind the back teeth even if you still have your wisdom teeth in place, as I do.</li>
            <li>The battery life is ok, not great.  </li>
            <li>, it is almost certain to harbor a considerable amount of black slime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This model also has several useful features my previous model didn&#x27;t including shutting down if you are pressing too hard -especially useful for me - and remaining charge indicator.  </li>
            <li>The 1000 Professional is slightly smaller than my previous toothbrush and operates at a higher speed.  </li>
            <li>I recently moved to a different state &amp; I have a new dentist now.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Three weeks later, we get back a used charger and what appears to be a new 3000-series brush unit.  </li>
            <li>You can FEEL when the brush has hit a 30 second mark (it does a 1/4 second &amp;#34;stop&amp;#34; twice) and the continues brushing, so you can move to a new quadrant of your mouth.  </li>
            <li>The first charge seems to take a very long time and it doesn&#x27;t seem to hold a charge as long as advertised.</li>
            <li>Powerful, long lasting on a single charge and with it&#x27;s built in timer</li>
            <li>My only complaint is that the battery can not be easily replaced and the battery lasts about 2 years.</li>
            <li>The other elements of this success include brushing twice daily, flossing once thoroughly at night, and then a thorough water-picking at a low pressure after the floss (with my waterpik purchased from Amazon, of course).</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a quantum leap forward in speed, feel and handling from my previous Vitality for which I paid around the same price that i was able to buy this 1000 model due to a current sale.</li>
            <li>It did not even hurt his gums when he first started using although his previous toothbrushes were either non-electric or battery operated kids brushes.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this one since the battery recharges electrically, and it is so much better than the other, cheaper models I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
            <li>I ordered this particular toothbrush to replace one of the same description that finally quit working after 14 years of daily use.  </li>
            <li>Its hard to get excited about a toothbrush, but he likes it.</li>
            <li>The only option we had on our first was a 2 minute timer that let you know you had brushed long enough.</li>
            <li>When it&#x27;s low the light turns red, when it&#x27;s charging it blinks green, and when it&#x27;s done charging it goes blank.</li>
            <li>The electric toothbrush has really helped with my dental hygiene overall and makes a big difference from the standard toothbrush (especially if you are like me and don&#x27;t floss).</li>
            <li>/&gt;So, after using that one for a few years, I finally upgraded to my 3rd Oral-B - this one, the PRO 1000 - which is just right!  </li>
            <li>Toothbrushes purchased at the local grocer are never able to give me the clean mouth feel that an Oral-B electric brush does.  </li>
            <li>and this one seems to put them back in tame territory, and that clean feeling is addictive</li>
            <li>I think that this toothbrush has the advantage that it is very affordable compared to other brands.</li>
            <li>It is a little loud, but my teeth feel much cleaner than with Sonicare.  </li>
            <li>Much cheaper than other options.</li>
            <li>Other reviews have said that they like how you \\&quot;don&#x27;t need to use as much toothpaste,\\&quot;</li>
            <li>One kept me from working too fast, the other reminded me that it&#x27;s time to finish</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really compare this to other electric tooth brushes as I&#x27;ve never owned any, but this seems to do the job</li>
            <li>Other than the price to replace the brush heads which are costly, I really like the Oral-B and will continue using it.</li>
            <li>The Oral-B brush, on the other hand, has one connecting point and a ring that seals very well.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other brands, but plan to stay with this one because I really like the way the toothbrush head cups each tooth.</li>
            <li>Isn&#x27;t hard to clean itself</li>
            <li>I like the small round brush head of this type of oral B because it fits better in my small mouth and reaches teeth better than larger brush heads especially the teeth in the back of my mouth.</li>
            <li>It charges the brush wirelessly, which is cool, and I honestly prefer the smaller base.</li>
            <li>I kept telling myself I couldn&#x27;t justify the money, but when I finally had the funds (and a recent dental visit showed me a few new &amp;#34;soft spots&amp;#34;), I said I would get</li>
            <li>I also really like the little bit smaller version for this new toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>I think this is a great product and easy to transition to from regular brushes - the base is also small</li>
            <li>Because the bush rotates at a high speed, it really cleans along the gum line,which will save me a small fortune in trips to the dentist.</li>
            <li>Either way it works really well and the base charges by inductance which is not only cool (albeit slow), but it makes the thing really easy to clean.</li>
            <li>only negative for me is the flashing light that tells you its charging.</li>
            <li>B000050FDE Oral-B Professional Care 1000 Power Toothbrush]]) sold at Amazon that has the same model number brush and comes with two different kinds of brush heads instead of the one head that comes in this package, and is cheaper.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used an Oral-B electric toothbrush for years and only recently switched to the Oral-B 1000 Professional.  </li>
            <li>B003UKM9CO Oral-B 1000 Professional Care 1000 Electric Toothbrush, White and Blue]]</li>
            <li>Oddly, I have an older Oral-B that is 4 years old, and is still working perfectly.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is a replacement for a similar model that lasted nearly 10 years and finally just stopped charging.</li>
            <li>bought the Oral-B Professional Care 1000 after checking the various Amazon reviews from others of their various models.</li>
            <li>I left my electronic at home and brought a regular old toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>Recently bought the extra soft heads.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll never go back to a regular old toothbrush again.</li>
            <li>this is the same quality as the old one, and works with the same brushes, it is a well built piece of equipment</li>
            <li>I prefer the Braun Oral-B electric brush to the Sonicare because of the smaller brush size that gets behind my teeth more effectively.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I know I have spent about 30 seconds on each quadrant no matter how I chose to break up the quadrants for that particular session.  </li>
            <li>I already own a lesser expensive model of the Oral b</li>
            <li>I am a little concerned about the toothbrush as it makes a funny noise with the motor.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;However, I believe that this product overall is a critical part of my regimen, and a manual brush or something cheaper would mess with success.</li>
            <li>The first time (and only time so far as I&#x27;ve only had it a few weeks)</li>
            <li>My new Dentist recommended this for gum disease in which I&#x27;ve just had to loose two teeth.</li>
            <li>I bought this to replace a Braun Oral B electric toothbrush I have owned for over ten years--it still works just fine, but I thought I should have another one ready to replace it when it failed, as I assumed it must, eventually.  </li>
            <li>This is at least my third Oral-b electric toothbrush, the first was a AA battery powered model that wore out mainly from a lack of waterproofing.</li>
            <li>little bit on the noisey side&lt;br /&gt;-Takes a long time to go from a low battery to a full charge</li>
            <li>They are a tad bit loud as one of the other reviewers mentioned but I can live with it for 2 minutes twice daily.</li>
            <li>This one was about half the price of the first one I bought last year.</li>
            <li>The rest of the unit is the same as before, no complaints as it is easy to use, lasts a fairly long time and small enough to take on trips.</li>
            <li>Its annoying that there seems to be some kind of gunk that comes out of the top of the handle and runs down the side!</li>
            <li>Used different brand and was hard to clean.</li>
            <li>Will stop for a second on occasion when brushing the teeth, but that may be due to adding to much pressure.</li>
            <li>after I wait for the little light to stop flashing (indicating unit is charging because people like to set and watch little flashy lights for hours) which I suppose is much better than waiting for a simple solid green light to come on.</li>
            <li>Apparently its enough to give this toothbrush one star.</li>
            <li>The Triumph had several speeds for different brushes but the only brush I used was the Floss Action.  </li>
            <li>This is deceptive advertising which I never expected from a company such as Amazon.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had all that long and hope it holds us as well as my old one.</li>
            <li>The thing i hate most about thus brush is the 30 second timer instead of a sound</li>
            <li>This is my first electric toothbrush, so some of my views might be misplaced, but I thought they would still be valuable to those also looking to make the switch from a manual toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>, it pulses oddly a few times, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to time for exactly 30 seconds (comparing to myself and a timer).</li>
            <li>/&gt;The vibration feeling took a few days to get used to and my gums tingled at first.</li>
            <li>Excellent basic electric toothbrush without all the unnecessary and expensive add-ons.</li>
            <li>To get the full oral b experience it looks like you&#x27;ll have to spend at least 80</li>
            <li>This is my first electric toothbrush - I&#x27;ve been using this for a few days now</li>
            <li>The batteries get pretty crappy at holding a charge after a few years.</li>
            <li>The first one I had went dead within about a month.</li>
            <li>Just a side note, be careful not to buy the really rough replacement heads, because the toothbrush is already powerful enough.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like being taken, so I&#x27;m pretty harsh with the rating.</li>
            <li>round rotating brush head is exactly what I was looking for.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It has a small, powerful head that allows you to reach all areas of your mouth.  </li>
            <li>it is my first electric toothbrush,I like it and use it everyday.</li>
            <li>When my first one died, tried a few others for about 6 months, I had 2 cavities during that time.  </li>
            <li>Had an Oral B first for a few years, then changed to Sonicare.  </li>
            <li>These are hard to fit into the back of my mouth to reach the upper back teeth.</li>
            <li>I did this because I wanted my brush to last as long as possible and will do it with this new one too.  </li>
            <li>I did this because I wanted my brush to last as long as possible and will do it with this new one too.  </li>
            <li>Braun is no help, as they are obviously more interested in selling you a new toothbrush than helping replace your worthless charger.</li>
            <li>This toothbrush is very loud and has a strong vibration that borders on uncomfortable to use.  </li>
            <li>Easy to hold when dry, otherwise grip is a little slippery when wet.</li>
            <li>One small gripe, the on/off button is kind of hard to find by touch.</li>
            <li>This electric toothbrush is fine, except for the fact that the button to turn it on is very hard to push.  </li>
            <li>Not too much discomfort, although it is slightly aggressive.</li>
            <li>Teeth cleanings are much easier with less pain at the dentist.  </li>
            <li>My dentist says my teeth are much cleaner than with the manual toothbrush I was using, with less plaque &amp; tartar.</li>
            <li>My dentist appointments are much shorter, I have a lot less plaque.</li>
            <li>I visit my dentist less often for cleanings, thanks to this brush.  </li>
            <li>Teeth seem much cleaner compared to the brush I was using previously.</li>
            <li>I also didn&#x27;t feel like I had much precision cleaning my teeth because the brush head is long and wide.</li>
            <li>It was a surprise to find that a smaller round brush head could work so much better than a standard larger round head or oval head electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t kept track exactly, but it appears to only need a recharge every few weeks.</li>
            <li>The first few days my gums bled, but now after a week they no longer bleed and there is definitely no buildup hiding at my gum-lines.</li>
            <li>Went to dentist after using it only a few weeks and for the first time in years they did not mention any problem with my gums.  </li>
            <li>It cleans your teeth so thoroughly that they truly feel &amp;#34;squeaky clean.&amp;#34; This may sound a little odd</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve went through several heads, which are a bit expensive and don&#x27;t last super long, but it works well enough to make it worth it.  </li>
            <li>This model also has the two minute pulse alert but it has two additional ones at about 45 second intervals but are less intense than the two minute alert.  </li>
            <li>These can also take the small round heads, or the larger more regular toothbrush looking heads -</li>
            <li>I hope they don&#x27;t stop making new brush heads for it over the next few years like they did my old one.  </li>
            <li>I am on my second one (and the first one is still going strong but has acquired an unpleasant odor over time which I cannot get rid of.</li>
            <li>This toothbrush needs to be charged only once every 2 or 3 weeks and has a courtesy reminder light that indicates weak power.</li>
            <li>I decided to purchase this after my old Oral-B electric toothbrush finally started to loose its strength after 6-7 years.</li>
            <li>The only bad thing about it is that it is annoyingly loud, not too big of deal, but just have to be thoughtful if your significant other is asleep nearby.</li>
            <li>Seeing as I am now really &amp;#34;into&amp;#34; obsessive brushing and compulsive flossing, this little number is a godsend.</li>
            <li>Love the small charger!!!  </li>
            <li>Also, I have found the rotating action of the head allows you to position it in hard-to-reach areas and then just allow it to do its work, whereas it&#x27;s much less likely to get sufficient cleaning action manually - especially if, like me, you still have some wisdom teeth left</li>
            <li>The new brush comes with a smaller base with no storage which is all I would need anyway.&lt;br /&gt;You could pay much more and get the more expensive models with all the additional bells and whistles, but do you really need them?</li>
            <li>I have sensitive teeth, so was a little worried; but so far no issues.</li>
            <li>The other possible issue is that Braun&#x27;s guarantee requires the consumer to pay shipping to return the toothbrush if it develops problems, whereas Norelco sends you a new one with a postage-paid label to return the defective one.</li>
            <li>A different used charger and a brush handle that also appears to be other than new.  </li>
            <li>use traditional way to wash my teeth for decades, and replace a new one every other month.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The ergonomics are not fantastic due to battery,but you quickly learn to adapt to it for proper brushing.&lt;br /&gt;All</li>
            <li>I am not sure if there is a need for variable speeds, since I only use the high speed, but the Oral B 1000 only offers 1&lt;br</li>
            <li>I bought this to use while I waited for Norelco to send me a replacement for a defective Sonicare (the second one to go bad, but Norelco has been good about replacing them at no cost).  </li>

            <li> I own 2 of these and love them!</li>
            <li> An electric toothbrush with a circular head, keeps a good charge, easy to maintain, and at a good price.</li>
            <li> Consumers Reports Magazine rated the Oral B smart series (3000 and 5000) as the best electric brushes based on evaluation of users by dentists (using plaque revealing dies).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Amazing.</li>
            <li> Light weight, durable, great to travel with, rapid charging.</li>
            <li> I had it for over a year and it works amazingly.</li>
            <li> IT is amazing difference for us that I got another one.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Awesome charge hold, Amazing effectiveness, but</li>
            <li> results are amazing</li>
            <li> Amazing product!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Fantastic price and does a great job.  </li>

            <li> My teeth feel amazing when done.</li>
            <li> Great Price and free shipping to boot.</li>
            <li> My mouth feels amazing after every brushing.</li>
            <li> It  would be nice to have something that will hold a longer charge.  </li>
            <li> My son, who has braces, uses this toothbrush and it is effective in cleaning his teeth.</li>
            <li> The website asks for proof of purchase and we have to pay our own postage to return it.</li>
            <li> Nice rubberized grip&lt;br</li>
            <li> It looks nice.</li>
            <li> This is a really nice brush.  </li>
            <li> This is a really nice mechanical brush.</li>
            <li> I am very happy that it arrived very promptly after I placed my order.</li>
            <li> It kind of tickled and didn&#x27;t feel like it was doing the job, whether it was or not, leading to me just not using it correctly.  </li>
            <li> the toothbrush is effective, but the metal pole is rusting</li>
            <li> Works well and really does and excellent job.</li>
            <li> I own 2 Oral B Pro Care toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li> liked that it buzzes every 30 seconds to let you know to move on to another part, and I like that</li>
            <li> Works very well and offered at an excellent price.</li>
            <li> This was a temporary condition that resolved on its own once I discontinued its use per the dentist&#x27;s order.</li>
            <li> We own two units because my kids have their own bathroom.</li>
            <li> She also using a flossing head and finds it highly effective.  </li>
            <li> fast service, great product at a great price.</li>
            <li> The timer is nice.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not stuck with the kind that came with it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how it got so many good reviews honestly.</li>
            <li> Nice</li>
            <li> not his own, for the foundation of this book.</li>
            <li> after two minutes it gives you a nice notification.</li>
            <li> excellent product, fast shipping</li>
            <li> THIS IS THE ABSOLUTE BEST BRUSH IV USED.  </li>
            <li> this came with some sort of clamp, or maybe a person to hold the brush for you, then it would be a nice massage tool for people.</li>
            <li> that has been popular for years.  </li>
            <li> The charge indicator lights are nice, as is the quadrant notification feature.</li>
            <li> i have to say it is kind of an ordeal to use this thing.</li>
            <li> But I I&#x27;m very happy with it,  if you charge it for the whole night</li>
            <li> Holds charge for a week and really effective.</li>
            <li> she&#x27;s loving it.</li>
            <li> The starter toothbrush has a 2 minute timer which kind of leaves</li>
            <li> is nice and sleek.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s a nice tooth brush.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m loving the Oral-B 1000.</li>
            <li> She was thrilled.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It cleans well and the brushes seem to hold up nicely.  </li>
            <li> Save your teeth while they are still good. :)</li>
            <li> Nice toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> My dentist agrees that this toothbrush is effective in cleaning my teeth and reducing the amount of plaque.</li>
            <li> This honestly might work as a nightlight in a bathroom if you wanted it too -</li>
            <li> Honestly I don&#x27;t think anyone needs timers, a stand, self-cleaning feature, and a pressure sensor for brushing teeth.</li>
            <li> i got this for my husband after he saw how much i liked my own.  </li>
            <li> I would have liked a carrying case, but none is included.</li>
            <li> To each their own, I suppose.</li>
            <li> Each time I go to the dentist they compliment me on how nice my teeth and gums look.</li>
            <li> I own both a Sonicare and an Oral-B</li>
            <li> Since I still had a couple of Oral-B brush tips and because I liked the brand, I decided to stay with Oral-</li>
            <li> Nice, since I brush for way longer than 2 minutes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too noisy, doesn&#x27;t take much space in the bathroom, has a great grip ... 5 stars!</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, it&#x27;s the thorough and effective cleaning that this model provides.</li>
            <li> and the timer is nice.</li>
            <li> I read a LOT of reviews on electric toothbrushes before going with the Oral B Pro Care 1000 and I am thrilled with my purchase.  </li>
            <li> Does a nice job, but a bit noisy</li>
            <li> Nicely packaged.  </li>
            <li> It took quite a while, more than 12 hours for the battery to fully charge and takes a good while for it to fully recharge to capacity after each use.</li>
            <li> It is as good or better than her</li>
            <li> Nice package.</li>
            <li> and I each have our own heads and share the handle).&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
            <li> both my kids were thrilled to receive these.</li>
            <li> She liked it from day one</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, great price!</li>
            <li> and I am thrilled with it.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Let&#x27;s be honest: it&#x27;s a toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> I already own one of these and purchased another to have at my dad&#x27;s place (out of state) while visiting him there.  </li>
            <li> Others may find it really handy.  </li>
            <li> My Dental Hygienist really liked the results of using this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Interchangeable heads are nice.</li>
            <li> With the help of Oral B and some good mouthrinses, my gums are getting so healthy.</li>
            <li> As a dentist I wanted an electric toothbrush that was effective.  </li>
            <li> Excellent price on a much recommended product.  </li>
            <li> I thought my old one was good, but this one is the best.</li>
            <li> I have had an Oral B electric toothbrush for many years and have loved it.  </li>
            <li> Kind of a pain.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It keeps you honest.  </li>
            <li> Each family member would probably require their own unit.</li>
            <li> this is safe and effective in cleaning teeth and making the mouth feel good.</li>
            <li> product came with a plastic travel case, which I may use infrequently, but it&#x27;s nice to have something to protect it.</li>
            <li> The handle is nice and has a nice feel and</li>
            <li> i kind of think it&#x27;s too forceful now though.</li>
            <li> It does a good job on our teeth, and we are both pleased.</li>
            <li> Very easy, very effective and makes brushing easy.</li>
            <li> Awesome fast deliver and at a great price too, packed well and easy to open, works great and about 50% off the price when I ordered :) Happy customer!!</li>

            <li> Its really worth a try !!!</li>
            <li> well worth it!!!</li>

            <li> A great brush and a clean unlike any</li>
            <li> I find that it works great, my teeth feel clean and n earthy after every brush.</li>
            <li> Our older Oral-B battery was dying and this was a perfect replacement.  </li>

            <li> Great clean feeling.</li>
            <li> Great product, leaves your teeth feeling silky clean.</li>
            <li> One of the best features is the alert to let you know the particular quadrant is done.</li>
            <li> It leaves my teeth feeling delightfully clean, and the timer feature works great.  </li>
            <li> This was an excellent replacement for an older Oral-B unit.</li>
            <li> This is the main reason I got this toothbrush as it stated this in the details, however this feature is nom- existent in my brush.&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise it&#x27;s really great!</li>
            <li> After a couple days my gums got used to the exceptional cleaning power and now brushing my teeth is so satisfying.  </li>
            <li> It does a very good job of dislodging seeds from strawberries and blueberries that I am not even aware they are between my teeth.  </li>
            <li> The packaging was very good and the instructions are clearly written with good illustrations.</li>
            <li> no brush can get, but it&#x27;s very good, leaves a nice smooth clean feel.  </li>
            <li> My new electric toothbrush is excellent and meets all my expectations.</li>
            <li> The new timiing device is perfect for brushing each quadrant and prevents one from over-brushing.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very good price and really helps cleaning all around my teeth; bright and fully clean!</li>
            <li> This electric toothbrush works great and recharges quickly.</li>
            <li> The timing device keeps you on track for a good check up and bright smile.  </li>
            <li> This is not an easy product to find or price in department stores or drugstores; it was a fair price for it and worked well.</li>
            <li> gets good reviews, but the vibrations are way too strong for me.  </li>
            <li> Looks good and feels strong.</li>
            <li> Great product and quickly shipped.</li>
            <li> Does a good job and is easily cleaned.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and the price is good.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s a good product, does what it claims, and when used as directed, it might be worth the expense for those who can&#x27;t seem to get a good, thorough cleaning with those old-fashioned manual models.</li>
            <li> &quot; I don&#x27;t like the sensation of this 1000 series Oral-B toothbrush, it is very strong and</li>

            <li> The downside, I&#x27;d say, is it takes more effort to clean the roof of your mouth and tongue, but this is a great toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I love it and a great clean feel</li>
            <li> Very very good toothbrush at a very affordable price.</li>
            <li> This brush was recommended by more experts because it&#x27;s effective and affordable.</li>
            <li> in all, I&#x27;m impressed with the Oral-b Professional Care 1000.</li>
            <li> All in all, I&#x27;m impressed with the Oral-b Professional Care 1000.</li>
            <li> And I think it&#x27;s really a good deal when the rebate is still available.</li>
            <li> Oral B-1000 Professional electric toothbrush is an excellent, quality product.  </li>
            <li> I feel like I get the best results when using [[ASIN:B000AUIFCA Oral B Floss Action 3 pack brush head</li>
            <li> /&gt;Oral-B used to make a sonic toothbrush called the Sonic Complete which still remains the best toothbrush I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
            <li> So far, I am very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Ok ive been an amazon prime customer for 1 month and its amazing.</li>
            <li> Easy to hold , just does an exceptional job cleaning.</li>
            <li> So far, we&#x27;re very happy.</li>
            <li> These are powerful brushes and do a great job.  </li>
            <li> I was so pleased with the Oral-B 1000 unit, that I decided to buy another for my children to share (of course each with their own brush attachment).  </li>
            <li> Good mouth care is important to me.</li>
            <li> Bought this toothbrush and so far I am very happy with it and both my husband</li>
            <li> , it is more kind to my gums</li>
            <li> Works great and well worth the money.  </li>
            <li> Great replacement brush at economical price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m looking for a good cheap head holder.</li>
            <li> I liked the water pick much better, but it also had issues with the charger and battery.  </li>
            <li> It is by far the best I have ever used.</li>
            <li> Product effective as described and quite satisfied.</li>
            <li> is far and away the best one I saw.</li>
            <li> I bought an Oral-B Triumph Professional Care two years ago and it&#x27;s wonderful.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush itself has, thus far, been excellent.</li>
            <li> so I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect out of it, to be honest</li>
            <li> I liked my ro to dent better.</li>
            <li> Excellent product- cleans thoroughly yet is not harsh.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Either way, great toothbrush, I made the right decision.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s still going strong!  </li>
            <li> it has certainly helped keep me cavity free and also kept my gums in great shape!</li>
            <li> good product; feels clean.</li>
            <li> Overall a great electric toothbrush for a great price.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Oral-B electric toothbrushes for many years and this is the best one so far.</li>
            <li> To be honest, I went by price, and had planned to use this one as an interim solution until I had more time to research and find a better one.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush is quite good and clean my teeth well.</li>
            <li> When I go to the dentist, I&#x27;m always told what good clean teeth I have.  </li>
            <li> Aside from the quality that it bestows, the rechargeable battery with light on the switch that would light up whenever you&#x27;ll need recharging is a great addition to the amenities of the toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li> Simple, does an amazing job and the price is perfect!</li>
            <li> dentist recommended this kind of toothbrush and I&#x27;m glad I was able to find it on sale.</li>
            <li> They promote the use of electric toothbrush, I agree that they work better than manual: more effective.  </li>
            <li> It works great &amp; is very reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> This one operates at a much higher speed and works GREAT with the floss action\\&quot; heads.  </li>
            <li> exactly what I wanted works great</li>
            <li> In general, a very wonderful appliance to have.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful, powerful product, far superior to its step-down version.</li>
            <li> ok for the price, not as good as original</li>
            <li> Great unit better than the old one which we used and loved for years.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Good version of tried and true product.  </li>
            <li> a charge\\&quot; light comes on probably about every 4 days (probably because I put too much pressure on my teeth).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, great toothbrush, with the best feature being the timed brushing cycle to ensure a really thorough job.</li>
            <li> It feels very comfortable.</li>
            <li> Using it is very comfortable.  </li>
            <li> Everything works great and the toothbrush is able to really clean my teeth so that they feel smooth.</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush, really gives a good clean</li>
            <li> good product, arrived quickly, would recommend</li>
            <li> The design makes it easy to use and effective to use.</li>
            <li> Decided to go back to Braun and it is a great device and feels good to get a really good clean again.</li>
            <li> My teeth are far from perfect &amp; bleed easy while brushing.</li>
            <li> It is easy to use, efficient and comfortable, with a good battery life.  </li>
            <li> I buy a large pack of replacement heads for it once a year at Costco at a great price.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend the Oral-B Pro Healthy Clean Precision 1000, this is an awesome toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Ok, so the toothbrush itself probably deserves more than one star--it works fine, brushes nicely when you push the button, etc.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why anyone would pay more for an electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this toothbrush after reading several reviews that this brush is the best combination of effectiveness and price.</li>
            <li> IF YOU LOVE YOUR PARTNER &amp;</li>
            <li> I love the 2 minute timer that let&#x27;s me know when to</li>
            <li> I love the timer on it which keeps me brushing longer.  </li>
            <li> I do love this and prefer it to SonicCare which I had used for over a decade.</li>
            <li> Totally pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> I would have paid more for the two speed if I researched more.</li>
            <li> Now I feel confident that I&#x27;m doing my gums a favor.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure there is a reason for this hole, but I think it should go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been spoiled with this :)</li>
            <li> Love it.  </li>
            <li> Lots more.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> So much cheaper than the store works great</li>
            <li> This is the third Oral B toothbrush I have purchased and I continue to be impressed by their products.</li>
            <li> The one I just purchased is for my daughter and she will love it.  </li>
            <li> Electric works better than manual, since you tend to brush longer and correctly.</li>
            <li> I wish they had made them at this price many years and many dental complications</li>
            <li> I wish they had made them at this price many years and many dental complications ago.</li>
            <li> This will help you remove more plaque from your teeth!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Electric Toothbrush cleans teeth much more than manual toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> The battery is not replaceable (it&#x27;s sealed, but probably for the better so water will not leak inside).</li>
            <li> Two satisfied customers.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush has much more power and cleans a lot better.  </li>
            <li> This is my second Oral-B electric toothbrush &amp; I have been very happy.</li>
            <li> make sure you wipe the metal rod that holds the brush head, as it comes in contact with water after use.</li>
            <li> I think the Oral-B cleans better and gets into the gumline as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I am satisfied with its performance.  </li>
            <li> and we both love it.</li>
            <li> I love my Oral-B.  </li>
            <li> i really love this thing..</li>
            <li> The brushing motion is much better too.</li>
            <li> and my gums are in better shape.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m sure this would message and vibrate (occuring in brush head)</li>
            <li> , if your dental setup is many caps, what is that doing to that glue?&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I hope this review costs you more than my $10 you stole.</li>
            <li> Great product at Reasonable price</li>
            <li> This is my second Oral B electric toothbrush, and I&#x27;ve been very happy with both of them.  </li>
            <li> and i&#x27;m extremely satisfied.</li>
            <li> I bought it because I figured the circular brush would provide greater range of motion than the rectangular shape of competitors.</li>
            <li> These are great tooth brushes at a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li> After reading the specs on the many brands and models I settled on this one.</li>
            <li> /&gt;2)Cleans my teeth better than any mannual brush</li>
            <li> I like these heads better than the OEM brush</li>
            <li> Able to go on vacation for a week plus without having to bring the charger.</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Just love Braun products.  </li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Seems to remove more placque thanmy manual brush.  </li>
            <li> I LOVE running my tongue over my teeth because it feels</li>
            <li> love the cup shaped bristles.</li>
            <li> sure you put the paste on by pushing it into the brush and then insert the brush in your mouth before pushing the on button.  </li>
            <li> The paste will just jump off the brush if you put a bit on top and turn it on.</li>
            <li> and I am glad to say that it does.</li>
            <li> At the end of two minutes you hear and feel some more vibreations</li>
            <li> My gums don&#x27;t tingle any more</li>
            <li> Updated review with more detail to explain my 1 star opinion---&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> you are shopping for an electric toothbrush you need to know there are many options on the market, even with this latest series by Oral-B</li>

            <li> i really love the timer.  </li>
            <li> I found out that all except the Oral B 1000 cost more money and gave you (1) longer battery life  </li>
            <li> useful though this is good for those who brush in quadrants.  </li>
            <li> Therefore, you can not use it on most of the countries.</li>

            <li> If you love an after the dentist cleaning, you will get it with this product.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to pay for more than one brush head.  </li>

            <li> It only needs to be charged once per week, which is great for kids!</li>
            <li> My Sonic Care wasn’t able to get the job done after many years of use.  </li>
            <li> I still love how well it cleans my teeth.</li>
            <li> It has so many alerts that you start to ignore them and might miss the two minute alert.</li>

            <li> Love using these.</li>
            <li> thing I don&#x27;t love is that it pulses what seems every 30 seconds.</li>
            <li> and i have to say that i love the way it makes my teeth and mouth feel.</li>
            <li> I totally love this product and recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>

            <li> Twice a day for 2 minutes or more.</li>
            <li> Had sonicare and like this much much better.</li>
            <li> This was a replacement and it works even better than the one I had.</li>
            <li> Better to keep it on the stand</li>
            <li> , the amazon locker system is absolutely fantastic!</li>
            <li> Then I will put away the charger until it needs more juice.</li>

            <li> sure about the cost of brushes.</li>
            <li> Not too sure about the brush head.  </li>
            <li> I would say this is my favorite toothbrush ever.</li>
            <li> Powerful, good reach.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Honesly, from what i have read, most people don&#x27;t switch modes when brushing.</li>

            <li> love it.</li>
            <li> love</li>
            <li> /&gt;Now if you can spend more, the difference between the sonicare and the oral b is a toss up, but at this price range you deffinitely should go with the sonicare.</li>
            <li> Love this tooth brush.</li>
            <li> and I have had many.</li>

            <li> Glad it was on sale.  </li>
            <li> Like this better than my Sonic care Flex care, seems like it removes more stains.</li>
            <li> Best to order extra heads when buying toothbrush.</li>
            <li> The starter level Oral B is actually OK, but the difference in the cleaning, longer charge, improved timer and better power</li>
            <li> makes this a better investment.</li>
            <li> This thing cleans much, much better than a manual toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> Replaced one I had for many, many years</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the spinbrush as compared to a back-and-forth type electric toothbrush.</li>

            <li> Cleans teeth so much better than a toothbrush.</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>

            <li> just love it for its convenience+ cleanliness.</li>
            <li> and my teeth feel so much better than with a manual brush.</li>

            <li> My kids will use it and I need for them to be able to store two brush heads.</li>

            <li> love it more</li>
            <li> The thing that bothers me most is that they had a gift coupon offer and when you went to that website, it had already been used up by the number of applicants.  </li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> You can pay more buying online</li>
            <li> I would prefer the 2 minute alert and nothing more.</li>
            <li> Combine it with flossing and you are on your way to healthy gums and teeth.</li>
            <li> Everything worked even the brushhead is better quality compared to my travel Oral B</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li> For many years I&#x27;ve used the Oral B budget version (appx.</li>
            <li> The motor on the Oral-B 1000 is much more refined.</li>
            <li> The body is taller and more slender.</li>
            <li> It makes for a much better brushing experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It makes for a better tooth-brushing experience for me.</li>
            <li> i had one for 10 years started to have battery problems , replaced it with tis one ,  so happy i did , love how it works , good buy ,hope it last 10 years ,,</li>

            <li> I bought this for my husband and myself, and we love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I bought it.</li>
            <li> The brush works, my dentist tells me it does a better job than a manual brush, and my check-ups are better.  </li>
            <li> Need I say more?</li>
            <li> My teeth feel so smooth after using this toothbrush every day with my braces!</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> and I LOVE</li>
            <li> Stick with the regular heads, they work the best.</li>
            <li> Love, Love my toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> Love this thing.  </li>
            <li> Cute color</li>
            <li> These were a better deal here than we could find elsewhere.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I was pleased with the construction and value of this battery operated</li>
            <li> It is not as advertised for two weeks, more like 4 - 5 days, twice per day.</li>
            <li> The hygienist suggested an electric toothbrush to do a better job of removing plaque at the gumline.</li>
            <li> Also the battery lasts for many uses between charges.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love the electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Much better than the battery version.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> MY HUSBAND LOVE IT...</li>
            <li> One of the better purchases I have made in years.</li>
            <li> and I think I like this one the most.</li>
            <li> I like way better then</li>
            <li> She loves it and says it cleans her teeth better than a manual toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Instructions could have been written better.  </li>
            <li> But I wanted to buy an extra one for my girlfriend&#x27;s place and this one was perfect for the price.  </li>
            <li> Alternatively, the charge lasts for 14 two-minute brush sessions (or one week of twice per day use), so one could just plug it in when leaving in the morning and unplug at night, then wait another week to do the same.&lt;br /&gt;  Overall, very happy with this item.</li>
            <li> This basic product is awesome.  </li>
            <li> Once it hits 2 minutes, it does a longer stop sequence, then continues brushing if you want to brush more</li>
            <li> I love the timer feature.</li>
            <li> , I didn&#x27;t think the 1000 was doing a better job than my manual brushing that I&#x27;ve been doing now for over 60 years, BUT...</li>
            <li> Better dental check ups and cudos from the dental hygienist</li>
            <li> I got this for $25 after rebate from walmart.com yesterday, I already love it.  </li>
            <li> Love these tooth brushes.  </li>
            <li> Great for dental health, compact with reasonably priced replacement brushes.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I believe this one cleans better.  </li>
            <li> Love this brush</li>
            <li> I love my electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> The units work very well and the feeling after cleaning our teeth is great.</li>
            <li> The brush is also softer than the Philips, which combined with the \\&quot;vigorous\\&quot; quality makes it better for gum</li>
            <li> My teeth and gums love it.</li>
            <li> My dentist love s</li>
            <li> Furthermore, rechargeable keeps its energy up, meaning it spins better than it does with a dying battery.</li>
            <li> Sure the bells and whistles aren&#x27;t all there</li>
            <li> Do this and your dentist will love you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The brushing speed and timing features signal this out as an outstanding performer.</li>
            <li> What more could anyone ask for?</li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> Have purchased several items via Amazon and have been very happy with results.</li>
            <li> Plus I was able to process a $20 rebate from Proctor and Gamble</li>
            <li> Glad i made the switch.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush just seems to have more... vigor to it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m extremely pleased with this electric toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> But this 1000 is a hundred times better than</li>
            <li> The brush head is great that it comes with, and really feels like it does the job.  </li>
            <li> Look elsewhere for a better unit.</li>
            <li> Got this for my daughter and have had much better brushing results.</li>
            <li> I really love this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> This oscillates faster, cleans better, and vibrates every 30 seconds to assist in the brushing process.</li>
            <li> Fabulous tooth brush!  </li>
            <li> I have used the Oral B Electric Toothbrushes for more than a decade.</li>
            <li> wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge for more than 12 hours.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m glad I bought this brush instead of another Sonicare.</li>
            <li> and I love them.</li>
            <li> Great electric toothbrush at a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li> I love how it is aggressive with its cleaning power.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I have been using it now for over a month and am completely satisfied.</li>
            <li> It seems like most people dont have that problem</li>
            <li> There is a 2 minute timer to help obtain the best possible cleaning of your teeth.  </li>
            <li> Wish it came with one more toothbrush head.</li>
            <li> The quality of design and construction seems to keep getting better.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush really does a great job.</li>
            <li> These heads do a better job creating the \\&quot;bubbles\\&quot; from the toothpaste.</li>
            <li> Oh, I needed more words.</li>
            <li> you to spend more time brushing (2 minutes)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love all Oral-B products.</li>
            <li> be part of your routine and you&#x27;ll feel better too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love the price and how this toothbrush works.  </li>
            <li> Since the more pricey electric tbrushes NEVER SEEM TO GO ON SALE</li>
            <li> I love the compact brush head and the cleaning</li>
            <li> Ask any dentist, these things are better than toothbrushes...who knew?  </li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> Perfectly OK.  </li>
            <li> I guess its just OK. .</li>
            <li> Recipiant seemed pleased when it was opened.</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> It takes many many hours, but, oh well...</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t ask for more.</li>
            <li> and I like it even better than my Sonicare brush.</li>
            <li> Love It.</li>
            <li> It works so much better than my 20-year-old Braun electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Like that Amazon had many to choose from.</li>
            <li> Overall, very happy with purchase.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure I buy another when the time comes.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is such a wonderful investment.  </li>
            <li> But this is not at all a problem because it holds it&#x27;s charge forever- literally. :-)  </li>
            <li> I have updated my rating to 5 stars after using this brush for the better part of a year.</li>
            <li> Much better than a manual toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Seems to get between the teeth better.</li>
            <li> I love mine and do trust Oral B.  </li>
            <li> The only drawback I see that there is no cover for its head or no case to put this awesome toothbrush in.</li>
            <li> I love using this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> to just confirm it should be okay to use a brush like this on teeth with fillings and buckles etc</li>
            <li> which despite my most gung ho efforts has always been a &amp;#34;do</li>
            <li> better job&amp;#34</li>
            <li> better than the vibrating one</li>
            <li> awesome toothbrush, makes it fun haha</li>
            <li> I love this brush.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is one of the most inexpensive ones!&lt;br /&gt;Needless to say… it&#x27;s already my favorite Oral-B.</li>
            <li> and I may buy some more for my grandkids.</li>
            <li> much more thorough than a manual tooth brush.  </li>
            <li> I think the 3 month thing is just more of a way to get people to buy brush heads more often</li>
            <li> then they need to make more money.  </li>
            <li> can&#x27;t ask for more then that.</li>
            <li> It really does a great job in 2 minutes.  </li>
            <li> Teeth feel great and super clean after each use.</li>
            <li> When you change a habit for many decades, and the product amaze you.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This (plus its stand)  is more conducive to packing for overnights.</li>
            <li> I love this electric tooth brush.  </li>
            <li> Bought the newer version and have been greatly pleased with it.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is okay.  </li>
            <li> I really love this tooth brush.  </li>
            <li> Love this brush.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad I followed their advice.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love this thing.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve been pleased with it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t believe you will get a better product for the price.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Things I think are better about the Oral-B:&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> My mom was so impressed that she bought the same one.</li>
            <li> Better than the one my dentist sold me for $160.00.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a former dental hygienist and very happy with the results.</li>
            <li> No complaints yet, keep it charged up every couple of days to make sure the brush is at optimal speed.</li>
            <li> I have used Oral B electric toothbrushes for many years.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to order one more for my boyfriend.</li>
            <li> I am extremely pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I love the Oral-B electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I feel as if I get a better brushing as opposed to manual brushing.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s definitely better than a manual toothbrush.</li>
            <li> OK product.  </li>
            <li> My wife and I love the Oral Pro 1000.</li>
            <li> LOVE it.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m sure my family could also use this.</li>
            <li> A rebate made it an even better deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Top notch product.  </li>
            <li> I love the way my mouth feels.</li>
            <li> I just need to order some more heads for my family</li>
            <li> A thousand times better than brushing manually.</li>
            <li> Fresher breath thus making me more confident.</li>
            <li> As I said, it&#x27;s OK</li>
            <li> Better On/</li>
            <li> Better On/</li>
            <li> I love this Oral-B electric toothbrush, and my experiences with Oral-B electric toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I got it.</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m definitely glad I got it.  </li>
            <li> Great service, received the product very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;Great product, just as represented.</li>
            <li> My favorite is the &amp;#34;floss action&amp;#34; brush.</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> Take the charger with you if you are traveling for more than 1 night.</li>
            <li> discussed me most was the rebate promised.  </li>
            <li> and I love it.  </li>
            <li> I phoned them and they asked me to read the rebate form one more time</li>
            <li> Ok, so what happens when I send in a photocopy</li>
            <li> I love this electric toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> Love the tooth brush.</li>
            <li> I should have known better than to buy a cheaper model.</li>
            <li> I love the electric brush.</li>
            <li> sure that you could pay a lot more</li>
            <li> She said to do with the plug in models as they have more power than the battery operated ones.  </li>
            <li> They do an outstanding job at cleaning teeth.</li>
            <li> I have been cavity free for over 2 years now!</li>
            <li> I like it  much better than Sonicare, which I had been using for many years.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;It fits over and around each tooth and probably does a better job.  </li>
            <li> We love our Oral-B toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li> Love it, works so well and whitens my teeth.  </li>
            <li> I get much better removal of tartar with this electric toothbrush than by hand brushing.</li>
            <li> Even though I wash the brush after use, toothpaste deposits build up on the top of the charging unit and these smell after a week or two.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re not making them like they used to , to last forever, but is probably still the best quality you can get out of an electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I so love mine and get better checkups</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended an electric toothbrush and I am glad I got this one.</li>
            <li> Works much better than those battery operated brushes.  </li>
            <li> I have been using Oral b toothbrush for many years.  </li>
            <li> Did not think I needed or would like the timer which seemed to come with most of them but</li>
            <li> and I love the timer.  </li>
            <li> It helps you make sure you get all 4 quadrants for 30 seconds each.</li>
            <li> Glad we did as it is MUCH better in my opinion.  </li>
            <li> My husband likes it much better also.</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> Be sure to check the Oral-B website for any rebates.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Since your satisfaction means a great deal to us, I’m also sending a money saving coupon that would be good towards your next purchase of an Oral-B rechargeable toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I gave this to my kids and they love it</li>
            <li> It would be perfect if the brush head is bigger.</li>
            <li> It had a place on the recharger stand to store the brushes and also came with more then on brush.</li>
            <li> Mine was a lower quality than this one and I am glad I replaced it.</li>
            <li> I feel like this is a great model because you&#x27;re not paying for all the bells and whistles that you don&#x27;t really need.</li>
            <li> This model makes brushing teeth much more enjoyable.  </li>
            <li> This brush feels more like a hygienist&#x27;s appliance and allows your teeth to feel well cleaned.  </li>
            <li> Just give it more time.</li>
            <li> The vibration of the Oral-B is a bit noisier and there&#x27;s more of it.  </li>
            <li> really glad I chose the upgrade &amp;#34;professional&amp;#34; compared to the &amp;#34;vitality&amp;#34; ($15 price difference)</li>
            <li> because although I&#x27;m sure it doesn&#x27;t cost the manufacturer to make it pause, the pause every 30 seconds helps me remember to switch quadrants.</li>
            <li> someone from Oral B is reading this, please give me more coupons for the heads.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> and I know that it is keeping my gums healthy.</li>
            <li> though you may get a much better one with 200+ dollars</li>
            <li> you will enjoy it, as well!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this brush for a couple of weeks now, and I love it.</li>
            <li> Love the item and the circular rotation on the brush.</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> Thirty seconds with this is better than thirty seconds by</li>
            <li> We were much more</li>
            <li> Works even better than anticipated.  </li>
            <li> the Sonicare wasn&#x27;t touching.</li>
            <li> But, I am pleased with the way it cleans my teeth.  </li>
            <li> This Oral B electric toothbrush cleans very well, is somewhat quite and alerts you when you need to recharge, Great value for the cost.</li>
            <li> But this did not bode well for an appropriate lifespan, so we returned them.</li>
            <li> Love this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> so I know it must be so much better than my manual brush was.</li>
            <li> Completely satisfied with delivery and performance of the product</li>
            <li> I say thanks to this brush, it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> My periodontist recommended this type of spin brush over the $10 variety and it has produced noticeably better results for my gums.  </li>
            <li> still like this brand better then others, but probably would not get this model again&lt;</li>
            <li> I was on the verge of having periodontal disease and after 2 months of using this, my dentist says my gums are in top notch shape.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been able to save money because now I see the dentist</li>
            <li> I love this tooth brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ive</li>
            <li> I love this -</li>
            <li> but I am satisfied with it.  </li>
            <li> and I love it.  </li>
            <li> I figure that they&#x27;ll lose a lot more money on me than they gained by screwing me on a rebate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You can stop the brush at that point to add more toothpaste (I use baking soda myself) and press it again.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s more of a marketing tool to get you to buy replacement heads more often, but you can use that as a reminder if you prefer.</li>
            <li> It also probably does a better job without brushing too hard.&lt;br</li>
            <li> And since it is reasonably priced, I am happy.</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> I love this one.</li>
            <li> Not to many pros.</li>
            <li> Simple but works great!</li>
            <li> It also does a better job cleaning my teeth.  </li>
            <li> Sadly many products are no longer made the way they used to be.</li>
            <li> But NiMH is better for the environment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I know my teeth and gums feel better.</li>
            <li> The brush itself does an outstanding job.</li>
            <li> Much better than the ones we had.</li>
            <li> This is just OK.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> Even better than my sonic that I had.</li>
            <li> but I still love it.</li>
            <li> Just rinse it more, you say?</li>
            <li> I even remove the top to rinse it out</li>
            <li> I gave these as a gift and my friend thought it was very powerful for a toothbrush, said she liked that</li>
            <li> So this is great to take for quick business trips as I can take up to a full week without having to take the charging stand along.  </li>
            <li> I will say though, that if my 1000 dies, I&#x27;ll wait for a good sale on a replacement rather than run right out and buy a replacement the day the 1000 died.</li>
            <li> feels right and does a good job.  </li>

            <li> &lt;br /&gt;-Mouth feels very clean after use</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush, I cannot use a normal brush anymore after switching to this one.  </li>
            <li> Liked it so much, bought two more for family members!</li>
            <li> It works pretty well, it holds a good charge, and also cleans my teeth</li>
            <li> /&gt;Works flawlessly and the timers on it makes it easier for my kids to understand how long they need to brush.</li>
            <li> pretty good</li>
            <li> but if you can&#x27;t this is still pretty good.</li>
            <li> First one I have ever had, like it quite well seems to do a good job I will find out in 6 months check up if</li>
            <li> Although not the most powerful electric toothbrush I have owned, it is effective and holds a charge for many days.</li>
            <li> I loved this toothbrush when I first got it</li>
            <li> Loved my first brush and it lasted for years.</li>
            <li> Nice to think a company out there doesn&#x27;t obsolete a perfectly good induction charging system just because it is a decade (or more) old.</li>
            <li> He is very happy with it and wishes he had asked for it long ago.  </li>
            <li> Excellent product.&lt;br /&gt;Waiting to see how long the head lasts and the cost of replacement.</li>
            <li> Went right back to my Oral-B.  Great value for a great product.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t get it if the seller doesn&#x27;t send you the original rebate form and receipt!</li>
            <li> I am really happy with ,y new toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Price is great, it has a lot of power to blast those unsightly bits of animal tendon and pesky escargot tails from betwixt your newly polished fangs.</li>
            <li> requested a new one, but great product</li>
            <li> Easy to use and definitely better for the teeth and gums.</li>
            <li> quickly (because of no need for my own maneuvering, which I was overdoing.)&lt;br</li>
            <li> Nice,  effective cleaning of the teeth, and removal of plaque, leaves a sensation fresh and clean</li>
            <li> My teeth feel especially clean when I go through the whole 2 min routine.  </li>
            <li> This replacement and step-up is dramatically better, - it easily holds a charge for a week without recharging.</li>
            <li> Effective; charges quickly.</li>
            <li> Love how strong it is.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush easily serves all MY needs -- but MAYBE others are better.  </li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush so far it works great.</li>
            <li> I feel like it works better and is more comfortable to use.</li>
            <li> It was cost effective, simple (just one power button), and does a great job cleaning your teeth and Dentists agree.</li>
            <li> Very useful and easy to use!</li>
            <li> Stand for the toothbrush is sleek and very easy to clean.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a great upgrade from those cheap AA battery powered toothbrushes and couldn&#x27;t come more highly recommended.  </li>
            <li> This one is the best, and I couldn&#x27;t believe it lasted 16 days on a single charge.  </li>
            <li> The Healthy Clean Precision 1000 toothbrush does a fine job of cleaning our teeth - you can ask our dentists!</li>
            <li> This brush has the right amount of pressure to keep my teeth and gums nice and healthy.</li>
            <li> Great fast service and my teeth look great after only a week :)</li>
            <li> This model is fine for me, don&#x27;t need to spend more money for a fancier brush.</li>
            <li> My teeth feel so clean!</li>
            <li> are so clean!  </li>
            <li> recommend this electric toothbrush for everyone who want to keep her teeth clean!</li>
            <li> My teeth feel as clean as after the dentist!  </li>
            <li> On a side bonus...you can clean your rings with it!</li>
            <li> Clean teeth !&lt;</li>
            <li> This one has more power and suits me just fine.</li>
            <li> Does the job well, makes my mouth feel clean and no changing batteries every 2 months!</li>
            <li> If you want clean teeth you need an electronic toothbrush!</li>
            <li> I LOVE it and recommend it to everyone because it does clean your teeth MUCH better than a manual brush</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had an electric brush in ages and it&#x27;s wonderful to have really clean teeth again without gag-inducing giant toothbrush heads.</li>
            <li> rotation of the brush is simply put, the best way to clean your teeth.</li>
            <li> Very good product and the second one we have purchased.</li>
            <li> Very simple, very good.</li>
            <li> Overall very good quality.</li>
            <li> The automatic pressure shut-off is great for people with sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li> I didnt think that i would b e using that feature, but it is really becoming part of my morning routine (and brushing will take another 2 minutes, so</li>
            <li> I love the prices and the free shipping.</li>
            <li> , everything else is great - used it to replace a 3 year old Oral-B Pro...</li>
            <li> This latest one seems to operate at a higher speed, which we like, and it has a nice balance when handling.</li>
            <li> We have tried the cheap ones found in most department stores and besides them being huge and bulky they never seem to work for more than a couple months.</li>
            <li> Electric brushes can be a good thing - there is quite a bit more cleaning action going on because the automatic brush strokes are way faster than your hand can perform so you will always get better cleaning.  </li>
            <li> It gets everywhere in between including at the most important gum line.</li>
            <li> A gift for a person who didn&#x27;t like to brush his teeth and, like me, now finds it enjoyable, including a light massage of the gums.  </li>
            <li> I can also apply more pressure with the Oral-B (important for cleaning molars).  </li>
            <li> used to use the Vitality model, but this one is sleeker, quieter, shows its charge level and - most importantly - has a &amp;#34;quad pacer&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I know I will enjoy this for many years.</li>
            <li> The 1000 is a great toothbrush that works as well as my old one.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush itself is great, but I&#x27;ve bought two of these so far and</li>
            <li> I was so impressed that I bought a pink one for my wife and she loves it.  </li>
            <li> This is the first time I used an electric toothbrush and this toothbrush meets my expectations - very satisfied, no hesitation recommending.</li>
            <li> Our old one was wearing out--the head would come off; so this  one was just great.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking to try a real electric toothbrush (not the Oral-B Pulsar cheapies), this is a good entry point.</li>
            <li> so the timer doesn&#x27;t really do a lot of good although I do like having it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s reasonably priced and does a really good job of getting my teeth &amp;#34;squeaky clean&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> good product, fast delivery</li>
            <li> and I loved it so much that I bought one for my boyfriend.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good product for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Effect is good, very like</li>
            <li> verdict: a good electric toothbrush at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> verdict: a good electric toothbrush at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> 1st electric toothbrush, works very well, holds a good charge and is efficient at cleaning teeth.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean, easy to use, and very easy to carry around.</li>
            <li> Seems to be more effective with it&#x27;s rotating vibrations, and the whole thing is a bit more streamlined and easily stored.</li>
            <li> new stutter timing feature is great; flashing light while recharging; slimmer, cleaner design in handle and recharging stand.  </li>
            <li> I was happy to find the toothbrush heads still fit a new model.&lt;br /&gt;After purchasing this product and using it for about a month</li>
            <li> Finally, an electric toothbrush that is pleasant to use and effective at removing plaque.</li>
            <li> It is unbelievably fast and strong and does a good job.</li>
            <li> It meets U.S. code&#x27;s definition of mail fraud--\\&quot;having devised or intending to devise a scheme to defraud....use of the mail for the purpose of executing, or attempting to execute, the scheme.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put great care into sending an Amazon receipt, the properly filled out rebate form, and the original UPC from the toothbrush in a VERY well-sealed (tape reinforced)</li>
            <li> This new rechargeable toothbrush is amazing!</li>
            <li> There was a nice rebate on this and the price was right.</li>
            <li> very cheap, Overall a great product for its price.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a pretty good toothbrush, makes my teeth feel clean.  </li>
            <li> It leaves your teeth feeling very clean and smooth.  </li>
            <li> I have used other electric tooth brushes but this is the best.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny! :-)</li>
            <li> The original toothbrush was OK, but seemed to be loosing the capacity to recharge.</li>
            <li> Used this for the first time today and I love it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other ones, but this is perfect.  </li>
            <li> I saved a lot of money as compared to other retailers like target, and it works great!</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is updating an Oral B electric toothbrush I&#x27;ve been using for over 8 years now and can&#x27;t say enough good things about it!  </li>
            <li> Oral-B is a great brand and this unit has extra-soft brush heads available for those with sensitive gums (like me).</li>
            <li> Easy to use.  </li>
            <li> I feel like I&#x27;m able to get every nook and cranny of my teeth clean.</li>
            <li> Easy to charge.</li>
            <li> Easy to set up.</li>
            <li> Whether you currently use an electric toothbrush or have never used one before, you&#x27;ll most probably be happy with it.</li>
            <li> and I love the &#x27;Precision Clean&#x27; style brush head.</li>
            <li> I take it with me when I travel, easily fits in a zip lock bag and into the suitcase.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> No complaints, it works as it should... and is sooooo much better to get teeth clean than a manual brush.</li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t tell you how clean, smooth and shiney my teeth felt after one use!</li>
            <li> I just replace the brush by then because they are continuously releasing better and more powerful models.</li>
            <li> Easy peasy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy on the gums, too.  </li>
            <li> It was easy to order another.  </li>
            <li> Easy to charge.</li>
            <li> This model is the most powerful and cleans in more than one direction.</li>

            <li> Arrived very quickly.</li>
            <li> and it fits quite easily on the charger.</li>
            <li> This is easy to pack to travel, it does not have all those accessories some of them have.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t tip as easily as you&#x27;d think.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;Recommend.</li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> I love this product - my mouth feels so clean and do not even feel the need for flossing.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s easy to use and recharge.  </li>
            <li> THe button to start the brush doesn&#x27;t work easily</li>
            <li> Easy to use and the battery stays charged for weeks.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a sure way to ensure clean teeth.  </li>

            <li> So easy to use and charge,</li>
            <li> My teeth felt sparkling clean after most uses, although I found that the heads seemed to fray and wear out a bit faster than the product claimed they would.</li>
            <li> that replacement brushes are easy to find and the model does not become obsolete.</li>

            <li> It is easy to use and can be tucked into a suitcase.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s still going strong.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it for a couple of months and it is still running strong.  </li>
            <li> So far, done a good job, battery life is a week or more.</li>
            <li> the toothbrush is strong so there are days when i dont feel well and using this made me feel nauseous believe it or not.</li>
            <li> To prolong the life of the battery I would strongly recommend not putting it on the charger after every use.</li>
            <li> Did the Vitality ever feel this strong?  </li>
            <li> Strongly recommend this product to every one.</li>
            <li> I would strongly recommend buying this.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s way too strong.</li>
            <li> this Oral-B is still going strong.</li>
            <li> : It is now October 2015 and this product is still going strong.</li>
            <li> rechargeable battery is still going strong, which was a concern of mine when purchasing.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Mine has been going strong with no issues.</li>
            <li> Strongly recommended.</li>
            <li> It vibrates strongly, which I&#x27;m still trying to get used to.</li>
            <li> Lightweight, runs strong, lets you know every 30 seconds to move along for 2 minutes of brushing (brush your mouth in 1/4s).</li>
            <li> It seems to run at a high speed all the way up until it stops, and that is good.  </li>
            <li> When I began to receive a fully charged with the electric toothbrush is very clean, very comfortable, and the price is very cheap, very grateful</li>
            <li> I love my new tooth brush, teeth and gums feel very healthy.</li>
            <li> so now I feel I can get the benefit of the better electric toothbrush without worrying that I am not doing it right!</li>
            <li> Able to notice a difference right away and continues to get better over time.</li>
            <li> My mouth feels very clean &amp; fresh!</li>
            <li> My mouth feels very clean &amp; fresh!</li>
            <li> I was a bit sceptical about this product at first, thinking it was just something my dentist was endorsing, but I must say, it truly is amazing.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with whole experience.</li>
            <li> Love the full rotating spin of this brush.  </li>
            <li> The battery on this is much better, it charges quickly, and I feel that I get a better clean.</li>
            <li> This hot charger and burnt gunk make it hazardous, I think.</li>
            <li> And the battery is also good, normal</li>
            <li> I had used the first version of the Oral B electric cleaner and this is a nice improvement.  </li>
            <li> Super happy with my new toothbrush.</li>
            <li> It takes down plaque beautifully!</li>
            <li> but as I get older its nice to know what I&#x27;ve covered :-)</li>
            <li> I got this to replace my older version - which is 8 years old &amp; still worked perfectly.  </li>
            <li> My husband and kids are happily still using their SMART SERIES with an LCD panel that tells them if they are pressing too hard.r reading of exactly what the 1000 series could do.</li>
            <li> Re-chargable stand helps you avoid the hassle of changing batteries (and yes, it really is a hassle) and best of all the heads are easily available from after market sellers, through Amazon no less.</li>
            <li> It comes with a standard head, which is good, but can use and a more advanced Oral B brush, which is better.</li>
            <li> It massages the gums very well and leaves your teeth with a nice, clean, polished feeling!</li>
            <li> new one I have is extremely good.</li>
            <li> This new toothbrush , I must say, is not as good as that toothbrush.</li>
            <li> the new one is superior.</li>
            <li> and  works just fine.</li>
            <li> I like it just fine.</li>
            <li> I took a step up to the Professional and am very glad I did, it seems to do a better job, but</li>
            <li> at first i thought sonicare would be better because it has more vibration..</li>
            <li> I bought this toothbrush and the Oral-B Power Sensative Replacement Electric Toothbrush Heads, and they work fine for me.</li>
            <li> Product is fine, works well.</li>
            <li> also the speed it uses seems fine...</li>
            <li> I like the light weight easy to handle slender brush .</li>
            <li> Fine with us.  </li>
            <li> The toothbrush works fine</li>
            <li> Speed and pressure is fine.</li>
            <li> This is the best toothbrush that costs less than 30 dollars.</li>
            <li> Wrap up your cord well and it&#x27;ll be fine.  </li>
            <li> Surely, the round brush head give me the best clean.</li>
            <li> but it works fine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving it 2 stars because, when the battery has juice, the toothbrush functions just fine.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone who wants a great toothbrush but doesn&#x27;t care to spend a ton of money on the higher priced versions.</li>
            <li> and it seems to be fine now.</li>
            <li> This brush will do the job just fine.</li>
            <li> I works fine and cleans my teeth.</li>
            <li> The diameter of the bristles is fine</li>
            <li> The diameter of the bristles is fine</li>
            <li> and it now works fine.  </li>
            <li> Otherwise it seems fine.</li>
            <li> Working fine and exhibits a lot of power for the cost.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve used mine for 3 years now and it still works fine.  </li>
            <li> My teeth were already in fine shape, so given that</li>
            <li> These are just fine for the product they are adaptable to.</li>
            <li> I must say it makes teeth brush more effective than normal way.</li>
            <li> Cleans teeth and gums just fine.</li>
            <li> Replacement brushes are readily available and easy to replace.</li>
            <li> Comfortable to hold and easy to use for children &amp; adults.</li>
            <li> As others have written this Model 1000 does a fine job of cleaning my teeth.</li>
            <li> It is fine to use when the battery works.&lt;br /&gt;But, now the battery died, and it cannot be used anymore.</li>
            <li> Fine, I switched.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Perfect for teeth I can tell teeth cleaner already less plaque</li>
            <li> It is easy and comfortable to use.</li>
            <li> My newest Oral-B does as fine a job of cleaning as its predecessors did.  </li>
            <li> but it is fine.  </li>
            <li> I have used an electric toothbrush before, and I was less than impressed.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;That&#x27;s fine if you brush leaning over the sink, but if you don&#x27;t, you&#x27;re going to be wiping up drips from your feet or the floor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> love the 4x30sec cycles for each quarter of the teeth, it disciplines me into adequately brushing my teeth every time.</li>
            <li> After 1000, that one feels so mild, more for gums, rather than teeth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had good luck with Oral-B Professional Healthy Clean Products.  </li>
            <li> Super pleased with this purchased and my teeth</li>
            <li> I bought this as I read that the Sonicare rotates too quickly for most people&#x27;s gums.  </li>
            <li> It does a super job and stays charged many days.  </li>
            <li> Bold charge it!</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is fantastic, spins very fast and really does a great job of removing tarter, couldn&#x27;t beat the price that I got it for on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Good product so far!</li>
            <li> When ordering this product, because I live in Australia and our voltage is 220 volt, I would have thought I would receive one suitable for our voltage but instead received 110 - 130 volt one (suitable for USA).  </li>
            <li> I was thrilled to find the new one is faster and has more features that I didn&#x27;t know it had.  </li>
            <li> Felt more substantial, longer lasting and pleasant than my wife&#x27;s $12 vibrating brush.</li>
            <li> and i thank all those who gave it positive ones, for the more &amp;#34;professional&amp;#34; users i guess there are many things you can nitpick about.</li>
            <li> it washes very clean, it has a light to indicate when you need to charge and when it will become full.</li>
            <li> Wish that this one came with the little adapter to hold two brushes, that would have made this perfect.  </li>
            <li> Having had dental issues, the electric toothbrush is the only solution to making sure that teeth get clean!!!  </li>
            <li> Very satisfied and highly recommend.  </li>
            <li> The only reason for not giving it 5 starts is when the device is charging the flashing LED is rather bright and reminds me of a large, bright outdoor sign flashing on and off.</li>
            <li> The brushing action is very good and better than our old brush.  </li>
            <li> You get a very clean after dentist visit feeling the very first time you use it.</li>
            <li> but this was a huge disappointment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;The problem, and its a huge problem, is cleaning the brush.</li>
            <li> and there is a huge difference in the results.</li>
            <li> We tried these and what a huge difference.</li>
            <li> very basic function..but great product.</li>
            <li> When you run your tongue over your teeth and you&#x27;ll feel the smooth difference.  </li>
            <li> Fantastic.  </li>
            <li> I replaced that one with a cheap model, also an Oral-B.  </li>
            <li> Makes my teeth feel so smooth again.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s fantastic!I used it daily and feel great.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to clean and water doesnt get inside it.</li>
            <li> I was happy with the Triumph which had an LCD display showing digital brushing time, tells when to replace the toothbrush head, charging status, etc.</li>
            <li> The newer model is quieter and has an added bonus of a light that shows when it needs to be recharged.  </li>
            <li> I really enjoy it and because of that the 2 minutes of brushing go quicker than I&#x27;d like.</li>
            <li> The cupped design works great, especially around the posterior teeth.</li>
            <li> This is the second Oral-B toothbrush I have purchased and they both are great.  </li>
            <li> Before this brush, I used the cheap $13 oral b electric precision toothbrush that was made in china and it is nothing in power compared to this.</li>
            <li> But, why would a light bother anyone?</li>
            <li> I bought mine for $38 free shipping on another site.</li>
            <li> I did have to velcro the charger to the counter.&lt;br /&gt;6)Very easy to keep clean.</li>
            <li> I paid $44.65 for the tooth brush and a year of brush heads, cleans my teeth, easy to keeep clean, will not fall off the charger.</li>
            <li> why is there a light to tell me, that the battery is loading?</li>
            <li> I am soooo happy to be back to the Oral B -</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is the loudest, most powerful toothbrush I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
            <li> Groupon had refills for cheap and you don&#x27;t need to switch until every 3-6 months.  </li>
            <li> It might be a bit more powerful or maybe that&#x27;s just because it&#x27;s newer.</li>
            <li> The bottom line is that it does a better job than you can do yourself, and your teeth are worth the investment.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, I really enjoy the feeling of the brush head on my gums and teeth.</li>
            <li> The tooth brush on the charger is nice and slim and does not take up much space.</li>
            <li> I had the cheap version before.  </li>
            <li> This model seems cheap and cuts out (freezes) when I use it.</li>
            <li> I had a great check up last week....</li>
            <li> It has a light to let you know when to recharge</li>
            <li> Really deep cleans, and works great.  </li>
            <li> Do these things, gargle with cheap H2O2 from the pharmacy (peroxide) and voila.</li>
            <li> And now the \\&quot;RECHARGE\\&quot; light blinks after every use.</li>
            <li> I called OralB and their automated information confirmed the info on the packaging, these two are not compatible.  </li>
            <li> I thought it malfunctioned because the light stayed off.</li>
            <li> I thought it malfunctioned because the light stayed off.</li>
            <li> Researched this Prof Care 1000 series and bought 2, for a total of @$90 which is a great deal.  </li>
            <li> It does a great job on my teeth without beating up my gums which I tended to do with a regular toothbrush.</li>
            <li> When we started using this model, we were blown away by how much more powerful it seems to be.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It works great, my mouth definitely feels cleaner than with a manual toothbrush.</li>
            <li> is a perfect option for an everyday brush to keep in your bag or for a travel brush.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> and that&#x27;s important.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll do a lot of cleaning in 2-3 minutes and that&#x27;s important.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is fantastic.  </li>
            <li> It has lived up to my expectations and I enjoy using it.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product.</li>
            <li> and I am overall happy with it.</li>
            <li> The charging light flashes, so it&#x27;s all hooked up.</li>
            <li> All the heads fit well</li>
            <li> Since this has a lot of reviews and is no longer available, I won&#x27;t go on.</li>
            <li> the electric brush was so cheap.</li>
            <li> This is my third oral-B electric toothbrush and they all seem to be great.  </li>
            <li> Works great and gets the job done in a very short amount of time.</li>
            <li> smooth vibration</li>
            <li> If your spouse is a light sleeper, maybe this would be a problem?</li>
            <li> This is a great basic, no bells, no whistles electric tooth brush.  </li>
            <li> Stays charged about two weeks and is so much more powerful than others.</li>
            <li> , it is such a great product.</li>
            <li> The flashing recharge light is helpful to know when it is fully charged.  </li>
            <li> i think it was worth buying it :)</li>
            <li> and it is more fun to use this brush.</li>
            <li> A display showing the time brushed &amp; happy face at the two minute mark.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Great product , very simple works well easy to clean</li>
            <li> This brush is worth every penny &amp; more.</li>
            <li> Yes, the induction system has no exposed contacts, looks \\&quot;neat\\&quot;, etc., but sacrifices efficient recharge time (maybe that&#x27;s why these are also available as 2-unit packs).</li>
            <li> Great especially for the price!</li>
            <li> This thing is fantastic.</li>
            <li> A light blinks to let you know when it&#x27;s charging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This one works great and makes my teeth feel like I just left the dentist.</li>
            <li> but I feel like it has made brushing my teeth so much more exciting.</li>
            <li> With the Oral-B, no matter which teeth you&#x27;re cleaning or whatever angle, the round brush is all over it and cleans perfectly.  </li>
            <li> I bought this product instead of a Sonicare one just because the price and the available promotion (rebate of 20 bucks).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received my order today.</li>
            <li> And with the rebate currently being offered, a great deal.</li>
            <li> It rattles, it vibrates like a jack hammer, it even sounds cheap and like it&#x27;s going to fall apart.</li>
            <li> Pay the money and forget the cheap.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem to by a snug fit.</li>
            <li> The two together equal, great oral care.</li>
            <li> A great thing about this is that it will tell you that it has low power already because of its blinking mechanism allowing you to charge it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> quicklyand is easy to clean</li>
            <li> the lamp light up as to recharge, adds a lot</li>
            <li> The charging light blinks while charging &amp; goes out when fully charged.</li>
            <li> My mouth feels much better after two weeks use, and compared to the cost of any dental work this is well worth the money.  </li>
            <li> I noticed that replacement heads are available in my grocery store.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s an absolutely *fantastic* toothbrush for the price.</li>
            <li> and it is itself easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Generic brush heads also work great with this brush.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much more powerful and I like the pulses the Oral-B does at 30-second intervals.</li>
            <li> great plus is the 30 second indicator.&lt;br /&gt;At</li>
            <li> This one seems easy to keep clean and hygenic.</li>
            <li> My manual brush felt insignificant in comparison, was happy to get back to using this brush.</li>
            <li> I am going to run a band of electrician&#x27;s tape around the handle to cover the light.  </li>
            <li> The oral-B Precision 1000 does a fabulous job cleaning my teeth.</li>
            <li> Replacement heads are readily available too.</li>
            <li> I like the fact that it stutters after 30 seconds, letting me know it is time to move on to another place in my mouth &amp; I like the light that lets me know it is time to recharge it.  </li>
            <li> and we replacement heads are available when needed.</li>
            <li> The oscillations are still very &amp;#34;tight&amp;#34;, and (obviously) the brush heads fit perfectly and snugly now</li>
            <li> This fit the bill</li>
            <li> I enjoy brushing my teeth with it.</li>
            <li> This model is more powerful and works with my  existing brush heads.</li>
            <li> I then bought one of the cheap rechargeable models, but never felt like it got my teeth as clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Have bought a couple different versions over the years and happy with all.</li>
            <li> This thing is fantastic.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to keep clean.</li>
            <li> and aesthetics are important - you have to look at this and fit it in your bathroom</li>
            <li> The charge last for over a week, so traveling with this is great.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t bother buying this cheap version.</li>
            <li> Also the 30 second triggers are great to tell you when to switch quadrants.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product that my family will not go without again.</li>
            <li> Also, don&#x27;t buy cheap brush replacements.</li>
            <li> I also don&#x27;t care for that blinking light...</li>
            <li> It cleans your teeth and leaves them feeling smooth and looking polished.  </li>
            <li> I almost enjoy brushing, almost.</li>
            <li> This one is simple, easy to keep clean, and does a great job.  </li>
            <li> It took mine about 36 hours until the blinking light (showing that unit is charging) went off.</li>
            <li> I am still somewhat happy with the unit, but I will definitely keep this in mind when buying another electric toothbrush in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> heads available for purchase</li>
            <li> It works well and is comfortable to use.</li>
            <li> Biggest drawback is that there does not seem to be a travel case available.</li>
            <li> I wish it could just beep or have an LED light up or something.</li>
            <li> It actually works great if you&#x27;re in a hurry and can&#x27;t spare two minutes.  </li>
            <li> I liked this toothbrush so much that I bought another one for my wife.  </li>
            <li> I like the choice of replacement brush heads available for this model.</li>
            <li> This is a great basic electric rechargeable toothbrush.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;It has enough features to do a great job.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have seen the light.</li>
            <li> but I knew when I ordered it no case was available.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to recharge it as much and the sensor is a nice feature.</li>
            <li> You will want to take your time brushing and enjoy the ride.</li>
            <li> But when I floss afterwards, it&#x27;s amazing how much stuff still comes out from between the teeth.</li>
            <li> As far as I can tell, it is doing a good job.  </li>
            <li> The latest model OralB is quiet and does a good job of cleaning.  </li>
            <li> So far, so good.  </li>
            <li> I liked the old one &amp; I love this one also.</li>
            <li> but so far it&#x27;s good and</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall a good intro to mechanical powered brushes for me, though I might go for something a bit more fancy next time.</li>
            <li> so far so good.</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> Cleans my teeth way better especially when my grip isn&#x27;t that good in the morning.</li>
            <li> Our teeth feel noticeably cleaner and we are able to use a much lighter touch than before while getting better results.</li>
            <li> the rotational/vibrational action from this model i thought would provide superior cleaning.</li>
            <li> love it, feel my mouth is super clean and fresh.&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li> so far so good.</li>
            <li> So far this is a good buy</li>
            <li> A relaxing way to do a good job of brushing, complete with timer to let one know when they have reached 2 minutes of brushing.  </li>
            <li> good for all cleaning purposes-- good for a narrow mouth</li>
            <li> Good for sensitive gums as well</li>
            <li> I liked my old Sonic Vitality better.  </li>
            <li> So far so good.  </li>
            <li> I was trying to replace the no-longer-made Oral B Sonic Complete (that I LOVED)</li>
            <li> So far, so good.</li>
            <li> It has some  advancements on the old one, and it&#x27;s just as good.</li>
            <li> Far superior tooth cleaning than the Sonicare</li>
            <li> So far so good.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Battery life isn&#x27;t as good as old NiCad models.</li>
            <li> Having an electric toothbrush is far superior to any manual toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I was happy to get a new electric toothbrush at first</li>
            <li> I find that I could spend more time brushing because it keeps your mind on what you are doing and doing it right.</li>
            <li> Please learn the right way to get the most of this Braun.</li>
            <li> The Amazon price was great and significantly lower than the price in local stores.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t take up much counter space at all, and vibrates powerfully for a good clean.  </li>
            <li> Also Amazon stayed true the their word of price matching and was very quick (&amp;lt;24hrs) to respond to my pricing challenge.</li>
            <li> Thanks!!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a very powerful product, I had brushes that cost twice that</li>
            <li> Very powerful.  </li>
            <li> a very powerful electrical toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;pro:&lt;br</li>
            <li> The battery life on this brush is very nice and I only charge it once every 3-4 days.</li>
            <li> It has 4 30 seconds segments - very useful.</li>
            <li> Seems very powerful.  </li>
            <li> Love the powerful, clean feeling after brushing.</li>
            <li> easy to clean and keep clean (though it is an every day maintenance thing).  </li>
            <li> keeps teeth clean like dentist does!!!&lt;br /&gt;good for gums and great current rebate!!!&lt;br</li>
            <li> Even the dentist made positive statements that the new brush was doing a great job.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been the best way to keep our teeth clean, removing previous staining, and reduce cavities!  </li>
            <li> Great price nice small stand.</li>
            <li> my dental checkups are always quick and easy - my dentist told me to keep doing whatever it is that I have been doing.</li>
            <li> Super easy to use.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super easy and it does stay charged for longer than a week.  </li>
            <li> Teeth have never been cleaner, and it&#x27;s quick and easy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used normal tooth brushes my entire life and this thing is awesome.</li>
            <li> My new favorite tooth brush!</li>
            <li> Good brush, though I found it a bit too powerful and not as smooth or comfortable as the Oral b junior sensitive electric brush.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It took quite a while to charge it up for the first time, so make sure you have something else available, just to play it safe on that first day.  </li>
            <li> I was able to obtain a replacement very reasonably on Amazon and had a $10 rebate from the company.</li>
            <li> but this one has the most needed features at a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li> So, when I needed a new brush, I reviewed the data on both the Phillips and the Oral B, and liked the sound of the Oral B reviews.  </li>
            <li> easily use and charge :) really motivate me to brush my teeth</li>
            <li> The heads are nice and small for kids&#x27; mouths and the built in timer is very handy.</li>
            <li> Bought this recently for my girl, it is very nice, battery charge indicator is a cool feature.</li>
            <li> I love my new Oral-b Pro Healthy Clean Precision 1000 rechargeable electric toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> and I love the new brush head that cups your teeth for an even better clean.</li>
            <li> And any electric brush is better than a manual when you consider how many more strokes it produces in the same amount of time.</li>
            <li> I forgot to mention it in my original review, but as \\&quot;icing on the cake\\&quot;,</li>
            <li> Have had one of the original units for a number of years.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth it!</li>
            <li> Well worth the upgrade price!  </li>
            <li> I have found that in addition to whitening teeth, the Oral B has significantly reduced the incidence of tooth decay and cavities.  </li>
            <li> and they now have the original receipt so you can&#x27;t check it or can&#x27;t return it without the UPC.</li>
            <li> Once the battery is full, the light stays off (which I like).  </li>
            <li> They sure are pretty.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d probably give it two stars for the toothbrush alone, but the one-star rating is because of the fact that the $15 rebate offer was declined, reportedly because the original UPC was not included.  </li>
            <li> My dentist originally suggested this</li>
            <li> Original battery for me was</li>
            <li> It is well worth the money!</li>
            <li> Good buy, no regrets.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just as powerful though!</li>
            <li> but I had the original Oral B version for years that I paid $100 for which seemed like a lot at the time</li>
            <li> So far, we are very pleased with it.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t need the higher cost models and much better than the Oral-B Vitality.</li>
            <li> but the details were in the packaging which I&#x27;m pretty sure I don&#x27;t have anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The small head is perfect to reach into all of the nooks and crannies of the mouth.</li>
            <li> This was more than I wanted to spend since I think the last one was about $20, but overall I am very happy.  </li>
            <li> The higher models move at twice the speed of this one and have a couple more settings, but then I thought,</li>
            <li> Having the unit with all my attachments just willy nilly on my counter, or even in a drawer, was driving me nuts, but I found a small bait-and-tackle type case at Daiso for $1.50 that fits everything perfectly</li>
            <li> but I found a small bait-and-tackle type case at Daiso for $1.50 that fits everything perfectly</li>
            <li> How can I resend original barcodes that I already sent?  </li>
            <li> I opted for this one since it&#x27;d gotten slightly better reviews than the Sonicare, despite being a couple of bucks higher in price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the Oral-B Professional Care 1000; meets all my expectations.  </li>
            <li> Small footprint and excellent cleaning.</li>
            <li> hope it continues to help him want to have fresh breath and teeth!</li>
            <li> and she&#x27;s very satisfied with it after nearly two months of use.</li>
            <li> So far I am very pleased with it.  </li>
            <li> I have recommended it to my two adult children and they are very pleased with it also.  </li>
            <li> My dentist recommended this toothbrush and I am not disappointed.  </li>
            <li> (since I, of course, no longer have the original UPC?)</li>
            <li> Because the customer has no recourse--they no longer have the original UPC.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t prove I ever sent an original UPC in to them now, can I?</li>
            <li> This is the first electric toothbrush I have used in more than 40 years, but it&#x27;s great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This was my first time using an electric toothbrush, so I might be biased...:) ...</li>
            <li> Ok, first the caveats.</li>
            <li> original Oral-B 40.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All</li>
            <li> It also seems to charge more quickly than the older model and performance stays better throughout the charing cycle.</li>
            <li> However this one is smaller, lighter, with more features and more enjoyable to use.  </li>
            <li> It took more than 24 hours to charge the first time, but shorter times since then.  </li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t found any models that are &amp;#34;family&amp;#34; friendly.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> /&gt;German quality of the toothbrush head is most evident versus the Chinese-made knockoffs sold in stores like BJ&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> but when I plug this Braun toothbrush into the outlet, there is a large &amp;#34;charge&amp;#34; icon that lights up very bright blue.  </li>
            <li> You get a dental cleaning right at home, it makes your teeth feel so clean and shiny!</li>
            <li> My mouth always feels incredibly clean and fresh after using this, and I feel healthier too!</li>
            <li> My first Oral-B was a Vitality which I liked very much</li>
            <li> My wife said she just really liked this new toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> My teeth and mouth are so appreciative of the new oral hygiene care they are getting!&lt;br</li>
            <li> my teeth have an all new kind of clean feeling.</li>
            <li> This new one pulsates much more quickly and seems to do a better job of brushing.  </li>
            <li> After using this for about 2 weeks I notice that my teeth feel almost as clean as when I get a cleaning done at the dentist.  </li>
            <li> It seems to clean the teeth well, my dentist recommended this brand.</li>
            <li> Clean teeth.  </li>
            <li> Quieter and teeth feel squeaky clean.  </li>
            <li> All these from a brush head that looked perfectly clean on the outside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t imagine trying to clean my teeth</li>
            <li> I hear this sound from the bathroom &amp;#34;Wow, this one is so much faster, Love it!&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Once clean, I remove the brush and run water over it and the tip of the brush holder, with the brush holder momentarily running.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried the pro white, precision clean, and dual clean brush heads, and I&#x27;m simply thrilled with each, though the dual clean head is my favorite.</li>
            <li> &quot; clean</li>
            <li> Teeth feel clean.</li>
            <li> The dental hygienist immediately said that it looked like I had gotten my teeth cleaned before coming to her to clean my teeth.</li>
            <li> /&gt;But this does come as a surprise and leaves me with the squeaky clean</li>
            <li> My teeth are squeaky clean when I&#x27;m done brushing.  </li>
            <li> I wanted to get one because I felt like my manual couldn&#x27;t get my teeth as clean as I wanted, and</li>
            <li> stars since they still clean teeth.</li>
            <li> Talk about perfectly clean.</li>
            <li> All you have to do to clean the unit is pull the head attachment off, rinse with water, and wipe clean with a towel or napkin.</li>
            <li> The Sonicare uses sonic technology by vibrating, so brushing is required when the unit is on or it won&#x27;t clean at all</li>

            <li> But need to pay attention to clean after use it.</li>
            <li> This is easy to clean, easy to charge, and is very simple to operate - which comes in handy when I&#x27;m less-than-awake in the mornings.  </li>
            <li> The only con for me is the bright light.  </li>

            <li> You have to buy the special flosser separate.</li>
            <li> Amazon offered a much better price than a large retailer, too.</li>
            <li> I bought it for my daughter to use with the special brush for braces.  </li>
            <li> It just doesn&#x27;t have and special attachments or anything.  </li>
            <li> He was right!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m certain this will be an excellent toothbrush, as it&#x27;s reviewed by independent sources very highly.  </li>
            <li> I love electric toothbrushes, they really get my teeth clean and shiny</li>
            <li> I have to say that this particular brush is more of the same....2 minute timer, battery life light</li>
            <li> This one is quieter, more comfortable, and easier to use than older models.</li>
            <li> Been using it for a few months now and seems to be doing a very good job.</li>
            <li> After several weeks of use I&#x27;ve been pretty happy with this brush.  </li>
            <li> First off, it felt surprisingly more powerful.</li>
            <li> The power is markedly better and the every 30 second reminder to move to the next quadrant of my teeth is nice to make sure that I am spending appropriate time on each area.</li>
            <li> It cleans my teeth well and is attractive while taking up minimal space on my sink.  </li>
            <li> Our dentist says there teeth look great and not nearly as much plaque.</li>
            <li> (it is more compact, so if I traveled for a long time, it would be nice to have around...</li>
            <li> I am extremely happy with this toothbrush and will be buying another for my significant other.</li>
            <li> The hype is true.  </li>
            <li> Nothing about it bothers me and my teeth feel super clean afterwards.</li>
            <li> I have found that the key to getting good performance is to replace the brush head often.  </li>
            <li> It replaces an Oral-B that I have had for many years, but had to be recharged every week, and did not have much power.&lt;br</li>
            <li> vibrate feature alerting you to switch sides or end your brushing is particularly cool.</li>
            <li> The action is effective but doesnt tear your gums up.</li>
            <li> However, spinning, thrusting, jerking, and whipping isn&#x27;t necessary to good teeth and gum healh.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell whether this is true or not without consulting a dentist.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell whether this is true or not without consulting a dentist.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had Oral-B Electric toothbrushes for 23 years and they keep my teeth white and my gums in good shape.  </li>
            <li> I can really notice that it is working way better than my manual toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I drive a 20 yr old car &amp; refuse to own a cell phone.  </li>
            <li> It began to lose the ability to hold a full charge and the power was also diminished.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good to have such a reliable product that I can rely on over the years.</li>
            <li> hope this product lasts a good 10 years like my last one!</li>
            <li> have liked it so far though.</li>
            <li> Multiple brush heads and sturdy construction makes this a good buy.</li>
            <li> I can tell from my rinses that this thing really works a lot better than manual toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> Unit seems well built, feels solid and of good quality materials.  </li>
            <li> the handle shows a full charge.  </li>
            <li> and it still takes 2-1/2 days on the charger to get a full charge.  </li>
            <li> cool.</li>
            <li> This brush does the job very well, and way cheaper than most.</li>
            <li> , it takes about a full day for it to charge.</li>
            <li> This is a basic brush and does a good job.</li>
            <li> Unit seems well built, feels solid and of good quality materials.</li>
            <li> It really does whiten and get at the plack better</li>
            <li> In my opinion, purchasing this Oral-B 1000 electric toothbrush is a good investment not only to get cleaner teeth but also to benefit from an efficient gum massage!</li>
            <li> It takes about a full day to charge it to the full but it will work almost immediately.</li>
            <li> It works well, have good reviews, and it does remove my plaque than my standard brush.</li>
            <li> It is a true value.</li>
            <li> I loved it then and this one is working just the same but with some improvements.  </li>
            <li> True, but I travel a lot</li>
            <li> you still have to floss), brush your tongue via tongue scraper 2x/day, and use your antimicrobial mouthwash for a full 30 seconds 2x/day.</li>
            <li> But a full battery lasts for 7 days of 2x/day brushing.  </li>
            <li> Eventually, I ordered the Oral-B 1000 as it seemed to offer a good value for the price based on various reviews.</li>
            <li> While this is not the top of the line unit, it does the basics very well.  </li>
            <li> get almost two weeks out of a full charge.</li>
            <li> After using this toothbrush my teeth feel super clean compared to using a manual toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s design to fit each individual tooth enables more flexibility in the style of your brushing, more like a dental instrument.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s design to fit each individual tooth enables more flexibility in the style of your brushing, more like a dental instrument.</li>
            <li> Also switches off if using too much pressure, although I haven&#x27;t been able to trip it yet into switching off yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oral</li>
            <li> I feel super clean after using this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Relatively inexpensive but a good quality product that does the job well.</li>
            <li> This is a simple good replacement.  </li>
            <li> , we wore out the last pair and loved them too.</li>
            <li> nice mechanical design, feels like a professional tool.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Helps provide better cleaning at reasonable cost.</li>
            <li> Overall, it seems to do a good job of scrubbing my teeth and the bristles on the head</li>
            <li> won&#x27;t go off on why Oral-B should be more environmentally responsible... and should make this device&#x27;s battery upgrade-able..</li>
            <li> This does a good job and is very similar to the one my dentist uses.</li>
            <li> Good product, I switched to electric brush two months ago, and I can feel a big difference in my oral hygiene.</li>
            <li> good charger, comes with one extra head.</li>
            <li> It gets my teeth super clean.  </li>
            <li> Otherwise, it&#x27;s a good, basic toothbrush.</li>
            <li> but I can tell when it has full battery</li>
            <li> This Oral-B is still quite good (and to me, easier to handle than the Rotadent), even though I think I still feel a bit of plaque on the teeth at times after brushing (however, the dental appointment comment was that I&#x27;ve got one of the lowest plaque amounts on my teeth, and I only brush twice a day about 1/3 of the time).</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush and my teeth feel so much healthier.</li>
            <li> good basic tooth brush.</li>
            <li> but it is really good compared to a regular toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So I think this is a good basic electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> This is a good basic electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Also, this is a no extras on this model which is not bad as a toothbrush should not cost a lot of money.</li>
            <li> They both have two minute timers, but this new one lets me know when 30 seconds have passed, making brushing each quadrant very easy.  </li>
            <li> i like thie item very much because it&#x27;s really easy for me to use</li>
            <li> The new oner will seem much stronger as it will hold a good charge.</li>
            <li> It produces a difference right after the first use and lasts most of the day.  </li>
            <li> Holds a charge well, seems quite effective, but super loud.</li>
            <li> I guess this is a good thing, and luckily you have the ability to back off on the pressure you apply.</li>
            <li> The battery on my previous one died after many years of good use.</li>
            <li> I used a Rotadent for a year and a half, felt it was good, it wasn&#x27;t the latest model.</li>
            <li> Healthy White Power Toothbrush]] does a better job of getting my teeth clean and has three speed settings.</li>
            <li> the years, I have developed my own technique to keep the toothbrush fresh and clean.  </li>
            <li> The vibration is too strong that it hurt my gum the first time I used it.</li>
            <li> It is easy to set up and charge and not as bulky as i first thought</li>
            <li> (I think), but it cleans off pretty easily.</li>
            <li> I was expecting a simple effective toothbrush, without many bells and whisltles and that&#x27;s exactly what I got.</li>
            <li> I received a promotion because my boss thought my fresh smile would increase work productivity, which it has!  </li>
            <li> Both rechargeable models have the built-in &#x27;three big pauses&#x27; signal to let you know you have brushed for a full two minutes, however, I am re-thinking whether I need to follow the 2-minute recommendation every time I brush, since over-brushing is the greatest bane my teeth</li>
            <li> It is also great for travel due to it&#x27;s size.</li>
            <li> Cleans well and leaves my mouth feeling fresh and clean.  </li>
            <li> Its powerful, gets your teeth really  clean</li>
            <li> The product is recommended for those who take their dental care seriously and want an affordable electric toothbrush that works flawlessly.</li>
            <li> This smaller brush head also had a strong massaging action which felt great on my gums.</li>
            <li> The product I ordered worked fine, exactly as specified.</li>
            <li> It makes your teeth feel so clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, powerful, effective and takes no room on the countertop for the charger, since it is needed only once per week.  </li>
            <li> It is the most comfortable electric toothbrush I have used as it is no struggle to get around the back teeth.&lt;br /&gt;Light and easy to hold.  </li>
            <li> I recommend this toothbrush for anyone with braces because the head spins really quickly to get teeth even cleaner than manua brushing.</li>
            <li> It works noticeably better than my manual toothbrush, in particular with cleaning between my teeth.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This simple, one speed, auto stop with too much pressure is GREAT.  </li>
            <li> A quick rinse and a wipe</li>
            <li> Thanks to the great review by a person who actually made a video of the product I was sold.  </li>
            <li> I have owned an older version of it for years that I also love.</li>
            <li> When my super duper Oral B outfit bit the dust</li>
            <li> The author is truly bold in Christ.......</li>
            <li> well packed and a quick post</li>
            <li> so you know you are spending adequate time in each area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And, it does take some effort to get it clean...not just a quick swipe.</li>
            <li> After using manual and expensive brushes for many years, I found this item to be the best in Dental Hygiene.</li>
            <li> Delivery was quick.</li>
            <li> Solid powerful motor, good brush.</li>
            <li> I paid more for the older model than I did this one</li>
            <li> The next best thing to going to your dental hygenist daily.  </li>
            <li> This model has given me the proper cleaning tool and my dental tech is more than pleased.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my third braun brush - and I must say they are just getting better and better.</li>
            <li> More to the point, my Braun coffee maker has been going strong for 5 years, which is more than I expected.  </li>
            <li> Also charges quickly.</li>
            <li> Charged quickly.</li>
            <li> These are way better than the older model that I had.</li>
            <li> Received it quickly and immediately started using.  </li>
            <li> It does an adequate job</li>
            <li> well made, easy to clean, very convenient.</li>
            <li> It came well protected and charged the battery quickly.</li>
            <li> But a bit too quick.</li>
            <li> Technically, it is still under warranty, but the shipping cost is on me, making it more worthwhile to just continue using the product as-is or buy a newer model.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery.</li>
            <li> I have a personal policy that when I get screwed over on a rebate, I do my best to not buy items from the same company again.</li>
            <li> I tend to brush too quickly, and this device helps me time</li>
            <li> So for anyone who wants a healthy set of teethes/gums (at the same time at great price) I would highly recommend in purchasing this today.</li>
            <li> I have used Oral-B electric toothbrushes for many years and highly reccommend them.&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE</li>
            <li> knew that Braun is highly recommended by dentists because it removes tartar and cleans better than manual brushes</li>
            <li> a great toothbrush and clean teeth are a worthwhile investment, I suggest you spend a little more now and save later</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just the right size to get to the back teeth and give them a good brushing.</li>
            <li> I Absolutely Love it so far!!</li>
            <li> Cleans  10 times better than my old Oral -B !!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Product itself is great, I like that it comes with a small charger so it can be stored easily</li>
            <li> The very first time I used this toothbrush</li>
            <li> Overall, very pleased.</li>
            <li> This is my first electric toothbrush and it is fantastic.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s only been a week, but so far, so good!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 36-years-old, and bought my very first electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> The usual brilliant Amazon service.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li> So much higher power than the cheap electrics I grew up using.</li>
            <li> I liked the other model I had before better.</li>
            <li> had other mechanical tooth brushes but this one is by far the best and</li>
            <li> - the rotating heads really are more effective than standard brushing.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyway, this is a wonderful product that makes an annoying daily-plus chore downright enjoyable and keeps your teeth looking and chewing nicely.  </li>
            <li> Anyway, this is a wonderful product that makes an annoying daily-plus chore downright enjoyable and keeps your teeth looking and chewing nicely.  </li>
            <li> All expectations met with no unpleasant surprises.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush does a good job of cleaning however, it takes a long time (approx.</li>
            <li> Battery holds charge a good long time.</li>
            <li> It seems to clean teeth well, is easy to keep clean, takes up very little counter space and looks good.  </li>
            <li> So slim and comfortable to hold, this brush shape can really get into all the corners and clean the days plaque away.</li>
            <li> This is for the Oral-B Professional Healthy Clean Precision</li>
            <li> :B003UKM9CO Oral-B Professional Healthy Clean Precision 1000 Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush 1 Count]]</li>
            <li> Works great, but I don&#x27;t particularly care for the blinking lights when the battery is low.  </li>
            <li> After using it for only a week, I feel that my teeth are getting more thoroughly clean!</li>
            <li> I love my new toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Glad I got a new one.</li>
            <li> I love my new electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> The new one is better, but not up to the published claims they make about time between charges.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love having a NEW electric toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> My wife and I love our new electric toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li> My old toothbrush died so I bought a new one exactly like the old one and am very happy with it.</li>
            <li> Previously we had been buying the disposable battery-operated brushes for them at the grocery store, but these were a great investment.</li>
            <li> What a great product!a half.  </li>
            <li> This tooth brush is definitely worth all $39 which is pretty cheap for an electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I can easily recommend this model, the Oral-B Precision 1000, to anybody who wants to use an electric toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> l like it very much!It&#x27;s easy to exchange and use.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t take much space on the counter, easy to use and handle is slim to hold.</li>
            <li> Works fine with strong action.</li>
            <li> very durable and easy to use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had an electric toothbrush before, but my dentist recommended I get one after my latest cleaning, reminding me that I needed to brush for 2 full minutes, because otherwise it simply isn&#x27;t effective, and that the electric softer can do a better job anyways while reminding us how long we&#x27;ve brushed.  </li>
            <li> Powerful when charged and charges quickly.</li>
            <li> easy to use and really made the switch from manual to electric toothbrush</li>
            <li> My first electric brush, good price, only one concern, after about 2 minutes it sounds as if it is going to stop but then keeps on trucking.</li>
            <li> Easy to operate and charges up very well.</li>
            <li> It cleans well, cleans up easily and is a much cheaper way to get the job done.</li>
            <li> You can just remove the head, but putting it on the shelf or counter isn&#x27;t a good solution, both for germs, and to allow the head to dry out between uses.  </li>
            <li> The flashing light is annoyingly bright and the battery seems to run down somewhat faster than the claimed 10 x 2 min brushings.</li>
            <li> Thanks Oral-B Professional Healthy Clean Precision 1000 Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush!</li>
            <li> The pulsations are very fast and gives you a squeaky clean.</li>
            <li> It does exactly what I intened it to do!</li>
            <li> And it was not expensive at all!</li>
            <li> Just be sure to brush 2x/day for 2 full minutes, floss at least 1x/day (no matter how good of a toothbrush you have</li>
            <li> As my first electronic toothbrush, I spent 2 hours researching consumer &amp; professional reviews, and I picked the &amp;#34;best&amp;#34; one - the one with the highest reviews and best features.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!!!</li>
            <li> This is my first electric toothbrush and I&#x27;ve been using it for months - no complaints!</li>
            <li> The charging lights which indicate status of charging &amp; low indicator are new &amp; welcome.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and does a much better job than regular tooth brush.</li>
            <li> I will definitely brush my teeth more often now that it&#x27;s so easy to do.</li>
            <li> i get the kids sized and make sure its super soft</li>
            <li> Works great, and the price was beyond amazing for the quality of this product, especially compared to other options!</li>
            <li> This is the first real electric tooth brush I&#x27;ve had (tried the cheap Crest Spin brush, but nothing on this level) and I did a lot of research ahead of time and decided the reviews and the price was the most reasonable with this brush.  </li>
            <li> Higher speed, more compact, and far superior to earlier versions of the Oral-B electric toothbrush that I have owned.</li>
            <li> Even if you shut it off right before the pause, when you press it on again, it quickly pauses again.</li>
            <li> Teeth feel clean (this is my first electric toothbrush).&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li> But other than that, I&#x27;m pretty happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> But other than that, I&#x27;m pretty happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I used my Oral B for the first time today and my teeth felt clean and polished like I just came from the dentist.</li>
            <li> It is important to use for 2 minutes, but for the price the quality is great and my teeth are much cleaner with less plaque.</li>
            <li> Powerful little toothbrush, light, easy to hold, and really does a good job.</li>
            <li> This is a great little electric toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> Great little electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I did a little research online and Oral B 1000 looked like a great value for what I needed.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great little toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Does a great job with little effort.</li>
            <li> its a little loud- otherwise great!</li>
            <li> It also has a longer more traditional brush that I like better for tongue cleaning, and for getting into certain spaces between teeth.  </li>
            <li> It cleans very well and is comfortable to hold.</li>
            <li> The thing that I don&#x27;t like is that the recharging light flashes while charging and really catches your attention at night when you get up to use the bathroom.  </li>
            <li> Were this properly addressed, or their page amended to be accurate, I would gladly give this five stars.</li>
            <li> The charge lasts several days which is quite handy.  </li>
            <li> THEIR SMILE</li>
            <li> I think this toothbrush is a economical solution to having a cleaner mouth.</li>
            <li> and I simply didn&#x27;t feel like it was effectively cleaning my teeth.</li>
            <li> It has plenty of oomph and a solid, precise feel, better than some others I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> Well worth the cost.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised to find that it works just as well as the Sonicare, and even though I have my replacement, I&#x27;m still using the Braun most of the time.  </li>
            <li> They weigh about the same, but the Braun feels a bit more comfortable.  </li>
            <li> Much better than my old but trusty vitality.  </li>
            <li> My teeth feel fresh and envigorated after brushing.</li>
            <li> The 30 second timer feature is nice too.  </li>
            <li> brushing is fun for me now..</li>
            <li> but i think massages to the gums with its powerful vibration..</li>
            <li> was stunned at how \\&quot;fresh from the dentist\\</li>
            <li> When I read the instructions manual, it had pictures of a different kind of brush head holder, I did not receive either one.</li>
            <li> The price is reasonable and the functions are enough for a good cleaning.</li>
            <li> Much better than my old one.</li>
            <li> and I had $40 dollars worth of replacement brushes languishing in the drawer</li>
            <li> , I looked for an economical replacement.</li>
            <li> We purchased two at the time, so lost out on $30 worth of rebate.  </li>
            <li> It feels stronger, the 3D effect is more comfortable, along with the 30 second timer steps.</li>
            <li> Replacement heads are well worth the cost.</li>
            <li> The 30 second vibration marker is a nice way for the kids to keep track of time brushing.</li>
            <li> I am not crazy about the pulses every 30 seconds</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s far better than its rival.</li>
            <li> After using the Oral-b for a week I can honestly say it beats the Sonicare (the Elite/Essence model) in 2 key areas, its precision and the maintenance.</li>
            <li> They are definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> and this brush gets into all the nooks and crannies and helps me to get that fresh feeling you have after visiting the dentist for a cleaning.</li>
            <li> If that happens, then I&#x27;ll have gotten my money&#x27;s worth from it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This one promises to be just as useful.  </li>
            <li> Have fun.</li>
            <li> What is nice is that the brush automatically vibrates extra every thirty (30) seconds, to let you know you should move to a knew place in your mouth.</li>
            <li> useful, but also kinda</li>
            <li> but for the effectiveness of the cleaning, i guess it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> Worth for the money you paid.</li>
            <li> better than the old one I had.  </li>
            <li> You just have to use a good 220V to 110V converter, try to use the heavy electric based converters as opposed to the light weight electronics based converters.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend them to anyone, They leave your teeth feeling nice and almost polished.  </li>
            <li> The cleaning action of this brush is much better.</li>
            <li> I think this was well worth the cost.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the Oral B products for years now, but this is an upgrade for me and so far I love it.</li>
            <li> I am pleased with my purchase so far.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a really useful product and all the dentists</li>
            <li> it worth 26 dollars.</li>
            <li> and I was causing both irritation and receding in a couple areas of my gums and a friend mentioned that her dentist said the rotary-action of these brushes can help correct that a bit - sure enough, I found I stopped making my gum sore every time I brushed, plus brushing was so much more enjoyable in general.&lt;br</li>
            <li> U will find it is totally worth it.</li>
            <li> I kind of wish I could deactivate this feature (especially since you can&#x27;t pause it to spit).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is a nice basic electric toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> I got this on sale for about $30 and it is well worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> , powerful, and holds its charge well.</li>
            <li> Much better than my old Sonicare</li>
            <li> But love it so far.</li>
            <li> I do think that my morning flossing goes easier since switching to the 1000, so I will confess that maybe the 1000 does better than my old manual brush has</li>
            <li> I bought it to replace my old Oral-B electric toothbrush which I bought for $20 many years ago.  </li>
            <li> i still have not nailed the art of brushing with this without drooling a bucket worth of saliva.</li>
            <li> The only thing I would have liked to have with this would have been a cover for the brush, to keep it cleaner.</li>
            <li> Even at Amazon&#x27;s price, the Oral-B is well worth the value.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s been outstanding so far.</li>
            <li> the model 1000 is worth the value compared to the 3000 or 5000.  </li>
            <li> I bought a package of Sensitive Heads and that alleviated the issue.</li>
            <li> Never thought an electric toothbrush would be worth the investment, but this has made me a convert.  </li>
            <li> It is simple and effective.  </li>
            <li> I bought this one for my 13 year old, I have had one for 3 years and absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> I bought the Oral-B Professional to replace an earlier model and it works great.</li>
            <li> Worth the money.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> The buy was totally worth it.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe this is such a popular product.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s verrry powerful.</li>
            <li> Well worth it.  </li>
            <li> nice product.&lt;br /&gt;would definitely recommend this to a friend.</li>
            <li> but my old manual does a much better job in between.</li>
            <li> they both think they are fun to use and</li>
            <li> Two features make it much better than my old one.  </li>
            <li> and then if i feel like its worth it, i will consider the investment in sonicare.</li>
            <li> Powerful without being abrasive.</li>
            <li> Big nice, should be improvement...</li>
            <li> (My wife charges more frequently, and her&#x27;s is just</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li> I heard this is useful for beginners -</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the money and does a far better job than manually brushing your tech.</li>
            <li> unit has a timer to make brushing fun.</li>
            <li> Worth the cost.</li>
            <li> But we&#x27;ll worth every dollar.</li>
            <li> It is proving to be worth the cost.</li>
            <li> but i dont think it would be worth it</li>
            <li> I was so happy to find this item at such a reasonable price as I&#x27;ve seen them in stores for 3 times as much.  </li>
            <li> I love this Professional line, rechargeable toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I bought the brushes for sensitive gums and am glad I did.  </li>
            <li> Definitely worth the money for improved gum health.</li>
            <li> The old buttons where better in terms of size and feel.</li>
            <li> This is a powerful toothbrush</li>
            <li> so it was totally worth it.</li>
            <li> Says her smile looks brighter and her teeth feel cleaner.</li>
            <li> although honestly I&#x27;ve stopped heading the suggestions and give myself a pat on the back if i even make it to the 2 minute 4x &#x27;job</li>
            <li> So far it works OK.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been able to find the floss action replacement heads in the stores.</li>
            <li> Has a powerful motor and leaves teeth with the just-cleaned feeling you get from a trip to the dentist.</li>
            <li> I have no idea, as the brush seemed to be powerful.</li>
            <li> so worth the money.</li>
            <li> Good purchase product as a expected</li>
            <li> This my favorite electric toothbrush so far.</li>
            <li> A good buy and reliable product that does what is expected.</li>
            <li> I pushed the brush head against my thumb with some considerable force, much more than any sane person would do when brushing and couldn&#x27;t get it to disengage.&lt;br /&gt;-\\&quot;stutters\\</li>
            <li> Smile is brighter and gums feel like they are in a healthier condition.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not really crazy about this one.  </li>
            <li> Performs as advertised well worth the  price.</li>
            <li> and I am able to use my old wall mounted charger.  </li>
            <li> I did a lot of research before deciding on the Oral-B Professional Care 1000 and I love my purchase.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely better and faster than my manual brush, easier on my gums, and the small brush head more easily reaches hard-to-reach spots.  </li>
            <li> It is very powerful and cleans my teeth very well.&lt;br /&gt;Would</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s a pretty reasonable number but unless I&#x27;m very lucky, it won&#x27;t take</li>
            <li> The Clean Precision line offers higher end models with more features, but this unit is exactly what I was looking for with features and price.  </li>
            <li> The brushing action is different but very effective and my teeth feel even cleaner than before.  </li>
            <li> After using this religiously gums are so clean and healthy, rarely any sensitivity or redness anymore.</li>
            <li> This is my second oral b toothbrush purchase, the first one I bought more than 12 YEARS ago!</li>
            <li> So, I bought one and love it better than my other electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I went with the Oral B Pro 1000 since its brush head looked like the best choice for me due to still having all my wisdom teeth and the need to get back to those teeth.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush has a powerful clean and gives vibration feedback every 30 seconds before a larger more prolonged vibration at 2 minutes to remind you that it is time to stop.</li>
            <li> Quick to ship and items are exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> I bought this toothbrush for replacement to my 12 year old Braun / Oral B electric toothbrush who was still working fine until my girlfriend drop it on the floor! ;)</li>
            <li> My Dentist finally convince to switch to an Oral-B to protect and clean my teeth better.</li>
            <li> Really the main reason I didn&#x27;t get the sonic care is because I was charged tax and it was $5 more....</li>
            <li> Not only does it clean your teeth much better than a manual toothbrush, but it cleans without hurting your gums.</li>
            <li> i really like this because it has a lot more rpm as compared to my older electric tooth brush which i retired after 8 years in service</li>
            <li> All in all, a fine product that I&#x27;d highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I bought this Electric Toothbrush for my wife and so far she have not complaint so it is great so far.</li>
            <li> The battery is good for about a week worth of brushing twice a day although I have only let it die out once, I normally keep it on the charger when I&#x27;m not using it.</li>
            <li> I had to lean way over the sink and just let the drool roll other wise</li>
            <li> Other then that it&#x27;s a Good brush.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used manual toothbrushes all my life and was never interested in electric toothbrushes, despite me taking good care of my teeth.</li>
            <li> This unit is loud and kind of feels like a small jackhammer but seems to do a good job.</li>
            <li> He is now admitting this new electric toothbrush is doing &amp;#34;a much better job than my old regular toothbrush.&amp;#34; &#x27;Twas a good purchase.</li>
            <li> but this new one is 1/4 of cost of my old one and does the better job!</li>
            <li> High qualiity and good features like the 30 second beep and the 2 minute beep.  </li>
            <li> Makes brushing teeth so much more enjoyable compared to conventional brushes.</li>
            <li> the price is right.</li>
            <li> The reasons I think I made the right choice are as follows.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t the right toothbrush for me.</li>
            <li> The size is just right</li>
            <li> I had to see a periodontist for an issue, and she noticed the difference before and after this toothbrush right away.</li>
            <li> It has just the right heads and is rechargeable.</li>
            <li> right by hand.  </li>
            <li> Who in their right mind would....</li>
            <li> Who in their right mind would....</li>
            <li> Therefore the price is right.  </li>
            <li> After you brush, you can feel your teeth surface feel just right after ur dentist visit.</li>
            <li> Now I know to plug it in right away when it signals.</li>
            <li> you have sore gums or something you might want to use caution and investigate whether this is the right brush for you.&lt;br</li>
            <li> you always spend the right amount of time doing what needs to be done.</li>
            <li> I am brushing the right way.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t assume you&#x27;ll get the rebate because you jumped through all the right hoops and sent in the right stuff.</li>
            <li> With the rebate, it cost $40.00, right up my alley.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Hubby was right again.[[ASIN</li>
            <li> Does the job, yet the price is right.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s right.  </li>
            <li> After reading the reviews this brush was the right choice.</li>
            <li> I am going to call Oral B and see if they will make it right.</li>
            <li> one feature, one can live without easily;</li>
            <li> Easy to hear/feel reminders to move to new area.  </li>
            <li> It cleans significantly better than manual, but is pretty loud.</li>
            <li> The speed of the toothbrush is so fast I don&#x27;t know how it can possibly clean in between my teeth and gums.</li>
            <li> I like the timer, which my older one lacked, and I like the way the light blinks as it is charging and stops when it is charged.  </li>
            <li> When used properly (for the full duration and following the prompts) you get a clean superior to a manual and to a battery-powered manual electric (like Oral-B Pulsar, Crest Spinbrush, etc).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was looking for something better since my 12yr old oral b spinbrush was getting seasoned.</li>
            <li> It has a fast speed, and seems to get her teeth really clean.  </li>
            <li> Unlike some weaker brushes, I can feel that this is really getting my teeth clean.  </li>
            <li> Gets his teeth clean without much effort.</li>
            <li> Have tried MANY types of toothbrushes to encourage a seven-year-old boy to brush his teeth longer than 3 seconds, and he actually likes this one and goes the full two minutes.  </li>
            <li> It seems to clean the surfaces very well.</li>
            <li> The price was lower then shopping locally and with the rebate, it was a very easy decision.</li>
            <li> The 7000 had a nice smooth vibration and was at the correct vibration speed to allow the brush to get down in between your teeth and their crevasses.</li>
            <li> This would be great for those people with sensitive gums who need to slowly work up to something more powerful, but for those of you who already owned an electric toothbrush I would get one</li>
            <li> i can feel a huge difference vs a regular toothbrush, much better then the battery operated oral b basic model for $ 7.99 in most drugstores.</li>
            <li> I believe that the slower speed is for more sensitive teeth/gums, but the \\&quot;normal\\&quot; speed has been fine for me - and I have sensitive teeth and gums.  </li>
            <li> My new dentist recommended this for me and, while I&#x27;ll was very hesitant to switch to an automatic brush, I&#x27;m so glad I did.  </li>
            <li> Very smart purchase.</li>
            <li> so I will try and stick with it, but it&#x27;s definitely worth it to splurge a little more for a better model.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Great clean white healthy happy teeth are the final analysis, bottom line, end result, and sum total of reading and heeding the previous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Off</li>
            <li> Oral B tooth brush is light weight easy to charge I was using a regular toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> This one is more compact and takes less room (the stand) on the sink - I love it.</li>
            <li> Be a bit careful about using baking soda or toothpastes with strong abrasives if you are an &#x27;over-brusher&#x27; which can cause even more worn enamel.  </li>
            <li> Otherwise, we really like how quickly it charges and that it does 30 second timers to make sure all four quadrants of the mouth, outlined in the included instruction manual, get a full 2 minutes.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve heard the floss action is even better so its possible this brush may be even better than this.</li>
            <li> As usual Oral-B makes a great electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> While they are most definitely better than any standard toothbrush, I find that I miss my old Sonicare.</li>
            <li> The head that comes with the toothbrush works ok, but I suggest you buy the &amp;#34;Prowhite&amp;#34; heads as they are far and away better than the generic head.</li>
            <li> My healthy  white smile is worth the price, plus the fact that it&#x27;s rechargeable.</li>
            <li> This is a great toothbrush for a small amount of money.  </li>
            <li> Works as advertised, I have been using it for past 3 weeks works great, I like it and would recommend it.</li>
            <li> Amazon had by far the best price--I had looked in several local stores.</li>
            <li> a small amount of toothpaste does a great job.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with it, replacing a ten- year old one hat finally died.</li>
            <li> It is also important to find a good hygienist who is serious about cleaning out the pockets, and doesn&#x27;t just give you a quick rush job with a cavitron.</li>
            <li> I was really hoping to take before and after pictures to see how effective this toothbrush was, but after a busy week I can already tell they are much whiter than they were before.</li>
            <li> Pro Health (battery operated, which is a real pain to open and change out batteries) which is made in China.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Spinning at much higher RPM than my traveling one, I cant wait to have dental checkup to see if this thing (which cost just a tad more than Pro Health) really cleans better</li>
            <li> The charge lasts a long time, and it cleans effectively.</li>
            <li> Oral-B Professional Healthy Clean Precision was more than expected.</li>
            <li> It still offers the power to do a good cleaning but now is much quieter and has new features that make it a better product, such as the charge indicator built into the handle.  </li>
            <li> Spending more money will not necessarily clean your teeth better, in my experience.  </li>
            <li> I have always loved the Oral-B brand and once again, they did not let me down.</li>
            <li> I use it to brush my teeth, up and down, side to side, and it does a good job.</li>
            <li> The brushing is very smooth, leaves a nice clean feeling, and I have not experienced any gum bleeding.</li>
            <li> This is not the Oral B Tooth brush i own, and ait certainly meets my expectations, Battery last about a week between charges.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The reason the 1000 was not as effective is because it comes with a standard head instead of the floss head like the smart series.</li>
            <li> of my friends use electrical and I always wondering why people like certain kind of brush.&lt;br /&gt;It turns out after I finally got one.</li>
            <li> I would invest a little more to get the better model.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The little charging light is also a nice touch.</li>
            <li> For example, I wish the handle was a little thicker just so it could fit nicely into my hand.</li>
            <li> Spend a little more and buy something better.  </li>
            <li> I think the OLD Rotadent is the the best electric toothbrush that I have owned, but the new Rotadents keep getting reviews that they&#x27;ll break down within a year, so that&#x27;s not a solution.</li>
            <li> This brush has a light pause built into it to let you know you are brushing too hard - probably a good thing for those of us</li>
            <li> I was happy with the price compared to other places, and the product seems solid, the brush head is comfortable and cleans well.</li>
            <li> The second thing is that this wonderful small footprint charger get very hot.</li>
            <li> The new one makes a huge difference</li>
            <li> now my new &amp;#34;Dental Friend&amp;#34; (this Product) is within easy reach and safe above the Lavatory Sink.</li>
            <li> The brush wheel oscillates quite a bit faster than it did on my older unit, making my teeth feel really clean.  </li>
            <li> Amazon sells a lot of replacement heads that fit this brush (and there are several kinds of heads that fit).  </li>
            <li> It is doing a great job cleaning my teeth and is a big improvement over my prior electrical toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> Ours is three years old and going strong</li>
            <li> I really felt the round rotating brush head is a joy to</li>
            <li> electric toothbrush is more powerfull than the old one, I&#x27;m really amazed by the head pulsing</li>
            <li> but the quality is not as good as my previous one I got from costco, which I did not find online.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased the Oral-B Professional Care 1000 Electric Rechargeable Power toothbrush and am totally delighted with it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-I had no issues with initial gum bleeding and am happy with the results of brushing with the 1000 compared to my earlier manual brushing.</li>
            <li> This thing is like a ferret on meth (in a good way, of course) and left my mouth feeling way fresher and cleaner than did my old brush.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li> The round heads are more maneuverable than the conventionally-shaped heads on the Sonic Care and, for me, do a better job cleaning my teeth.</li>
            <li> Came super fast too.</li>
            <li> Great item, use it everyday and really like it.</li>
            <li> No complaints, price was good, it&#x27;s quieter than a previous Oral B brush I had</li>
            <li> Head rotates super fast.  </li>
            <li> (connector at head attachment developed a crack, still works but has a buzz and not as strong brushing).</li>
            <li> There are cheap generic brush head replacements available.</li>
            <li> Most likely is the battery that is has reached the end of its useful life time and the battery cannot be replaced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> worked great never going back to a regular tooth brush</li>
            <li> It makes my teeth feel extra clean and is easy to use.</li>
            <li> This unit has a battery that will last a week w/o charging when brushing twice/day and then the battery low indicator will come on, a great feature.</li>
            <li> Minor downside: when charging, a green light on the handle flashes very brightly.  </li>
            <li> This is far superior to the lower end electronic toothbrushes and the easy to use plug in charging station keeps this running 7 days or longer on one charge, and there are NO batteries to mess with.  </li>
            <li> I like the high speed of the brush and seems to clean well.</li>
            <li> I bought it for my 10 year old son who has problems with brushing long enough; so this was perfect since it has a timer that allows it to brush for 2 minutes!  </li>
            <li> However I liked the first one so much that I purchased this second one.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It is everything that I expected and more!</li>
            <li> I like it very much, it does its job</li>
            <li> Very fast, efficient cleaning teeth.</li>
            <li> I like this product very much.  </li>
            <li> The cost of electric toothbrush was very reasonable.</li>
            <li> This was just what I needed thank you very much</li>
            <li> It never was very fast.</li>
            <li> and I like it very much.  </li>
            <li> The strong motor and small head just works so much better than most other brand of electric toothbrushes and infinitely more cleaner than using a manual brush.</li>
            <li> This cheap model will only hold its charge for about 3 brushing sessions before you notice a significant performance decrease and the unit would need to be fully recharged.  </li>
            <li> I appreciate that it is relatively cheap compared to most of the other options</li>
            <li> So far the toothbrush has been fine.  </li>
            <li> Coffee + teas w/ fruits (especially the blueberry) had resulted in significant staining of these older teeth, requiring significant efforts by the hygienist to clean them up.</li>
            <li> This is a good product to pack when traveling...takes up little space...</li>
            <li> Good product, heads last about as long as the original ones.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;just went to the dentist\\&quot; clean, smooth feeling if properly used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I am always left with a smooth, clean finish.</li>
            <li> Powerful spinning action makes teeth feel really clean.  </li>
            <li> Mouth always feels clean and refreshed and the price was much better than expected.</li>
            <li> I actually liked an older brush head that just recently you can&#x27;t seem to get anymore</li>
            <li> It reaches to the back teeth, gets into tight corners, and is able to give a good scrub in every dental nook and cranny.</li>
            <li> Maybe my unit is defective or maybe I don&#x27;t know what to expect, but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve experienced an alert from my 1000 when pressing too hard.  </li>
            <li> Great toothbrush but hard to find replacement heads.</li>
            <li> It stutters too when you&#x27;re brushing too hard, which is a welcome feature that I didn&#x27;t have before.</li>
            <li> After using 2 great expensive toothbrushes for 10 years (recommended by my orthodontist), I was quite hesitent to try my husband&#x27;s suggestion and purchase an &#x27;Oral-B Professional Healthy Clean Precision 1000 Rechargeable Electric&#x27; when mine died.  </li>
            <li> this new model makes a noticeable improvement in how clean my teeth feel.</li>
            <li> It seems to get my teeth (and my 2 removable bridges) much cleaner than the old one and is one I would highly recommend because it has a lot more power than the old one and does such a good job.</li>
            <li> My oral hygenist noticed a huge difference when we had to get rid of our old Oral B.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This unit is loud and has a huge amount of vibration.  </li>
            <li> Seems fine, but the brush doesn&#x27;t do nearly as many RPMs as previous toothbrushes that we&#x27;ve owned.  </li>
            <li> Thanks, Amazon!</li>
            <li> My first electric tooth brush, no problems with it yet.</li>
            <li> My first electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> It was damaged during the first charging.</li>
            <li> The first thing they told me to do was get an Oral-B rechargeable toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> replacing the one i have had since they first came out</li>
            <li> so  just ordering the same product  many many  years later.</li>
            <li> Works ok but battery life pretty short.</li>
            <li> but I actually look forward to brushing my teeth with this :-)</li>
            <li> kind of brush is a lot more expensive than a manual brush, of course, and replacement brush heads aren&#x27;t cheap either.  </li>
            <li> works exactly as advertized</li>
            <li> first change is that brushing with the Oral-b PC 1000 is counterintuitive: the brush does all the work.</li>
            <li> This provides a different and much more thorough cleaning than the one that manual toothbrushes</li>
            <li> Not too loud - a humming sound is all that you hear</li>
            <li> a Braun or and Oral B - the Oral B 1000 is a top choice for a moderately priced electric toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Our teeth feel much cleaner since using them!</li>
            <li> This is my second electric toothbrush and I can say its significantly better than my first.</li>
            <li> Replacement heads are sold everywhere and are not expensive..</li>
            <li> though I don&#x27;t have anything to compare it with since I am a first time user.  </li>
            <li> and i&#x27;m sure my dentist will notice a difference on my next visit.  </li>
            <li> I researched a lot of different options before ordering my first electric toothbrush, and I&#x27;m glad I went with this product.</li>
            <li> Pretty convenient for them</li>
            <li> The first one is a 3D Excel that I&#x27;ve used for over five years.  </li>
            <li> but I need to get more brushes because it only comes with one.</li>
            <li> Should buy higher models</li>
            <li> The first one I bought 3 years ago.  </li>
            <li> The only issue I had is not being able to use the manufacturer&#x27;s rebate because it was not purchased from a retail store and receipts from Amazon would not be honored.  </li>
            <li> Saved me twice when my wife left the gas on our stove top on.</li>
            <li> This is important to me since I have a lot of fillings and sensitive gums</li>
            <li> will use a regular toothbrush on occasion if a tooth is hurting me or if it feels like the tooth needs more cleaning.  </li>
            <li> Exactly what we wanted.</li>
            <li> My dentist, who had recommended the Oral-B toothbrush in the first place, diagnosed the Oral-B electric toothbrush as being to blame for taking the enamel off my teeth.</li>
            <li> I then turned to the box for a closer reading of exactly what the 1000 series could do.</li>
            <li> there are different models, some with more options than others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> there are different models, some with more options than others.     </li>
            <li> But I guess it cleans better than a regular toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Your teeth will feel so much healthier!</li>
            <li> this slow cooker works great.  </li>
            <li> Since I have been using Oral B electric toothbrushes for several years now, my dental checkups have been much better.  </li>
            <li> This is my first electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I would give the Phillips a try next time, as I am not in love with the cleaning I get from the Oral-B ones.</li>
            <li> , it says it may make your gums bleed at first...</li>
            <li> I would recommend this tooth brush over a manual toothbrush as it definitely does a better job.</li>
            <li> I had many of the brush heads left</li>
            <li> I feel the electric toothbrush cleans my teeth much better than standard brushing.  </li>
            <li> Without that, I&#x27;m sure my brushing would only take me about 80</li>
            <li> I have always been big on dental care and brush my teeth more than 2x a day and was glad when I received this as a christmas present!</li>
            <li> I also love how it oscillates and the 2-minute timer on it with 30-second reminders to move to a different area of my mouth.</li>
            <li> This is my first electronic toothbrush</li>
            <li> She also said my gums were in much better shape, so it definitely works!</li>
            <li> Works exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll have to admit this is my first Oral-b ever since I started using an electric toothbrush</li>
            <li> Works very well around braces, too!</li>
            <li> the same brush is being sold for 70 or more at retail</li>
            <li> I bought this one to replace the first one that my son broke.</li>
            <li> We have used Oral-B rechargeable toothbrushes for several years and are quite satisfied with them.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel it accomplishes any more than the basic brush heads.</li>
            <li> this is my first electric toothbrush</li>
            <li> Otherwise, it does exactly what it should.</li>
            <li> Love the battery indicator lights and the 30 second notifications to switch sides.</li>
            <li> the charging time will last for more than a week, almost two weeks.  </li>
            <li> The $30 price is great, considering it can last for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> would recommend it to anyone that is interested in Dental hygiene.</li>
            <li> I feel like it cleans my teeth quite a bit better than a standard toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I also love the 30 second timer: it helps me budget my time and brush my teeth evenly.</li>
            <li> It feels like it is doing a much better job than a regular tooth brush.</li>
            <li> I was looking at this and some sonic brushes that were double the price, and I&#x27;m definitely glad I went with this brush.</li>
            <li> I bought another Oral-B because I was so satisfied with my prior unit.  </li>
            <li> This toothbrush cleans my teeth better than my last oral.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush is a quality Oral-B product as to say it&#x27;s feels top notch and should last years.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li> was blown away on first use as the power was twice that of the Vitality series.</li>
            <li> Battery does not hold enough charge for more than one use before having to recharge.</li>
            <li> no way to avoid this really!</li>
            <li> for fitting smaller mouths.&lt;br /&gt;Charging is easy.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, when I got an Oral-B 1000 Pro Care Electric Toothbrush, the differences were very noticeable!</li>
            <li> When I went to the dentist recently after not having gone for over twenty years, they seemed to think my teeth were in outstanding shape, except for the fact that I was over-brushing.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This was my first experience with an electric toothbrush - and I purchased it as a suggestion from my dentist.  </li>
            <li> I found it to be better than just brushing with a regular toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> , I really like this brush!</li>
            <li> Exactly as advertised</li>
            <li> I love that it has the ability to let you know when you&#x27;ve brushed in each area of your mouth for the recommended amount of time.</li>
            <li> I am not even able to contact this manufacturer to complain about the short life of this product.  </li>
            <li> This is my first electric toothbrush</li>
            <li> It is our first time using an electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> It had been 5 years since I had bought my first Oral B Electric toothbrush</li>
            <li> I regret not buying one when they first came on the market,I would have saved thousands of dollars in dental bills.</li>
            <li> First time I used this brush was like murdering my teeth with mega vibrations.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have all the bells and whistles of the higher end models, but it cleans your teeth just as well in my opinion.  </li>
            <li> My last one was much better.</li>
            <li> My first electric tooth brush and all I can say is it does the job</li>
            <li> Not too many frills, and not too basic.</li>
            <li> A charge lasts about a week, used twice a day, consistent w/ the informational pamphlet.</li>
            <li> I know from the manual that that may go away after continued usage, but I just wasn&#x27;t willing to wait on it.</li>
            <li> I am sure it will help if she uses it regularly.</li>
            <li> You really won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
            <li> These two qualities makes it better for deep cleaning.  </li>
            <li> Exactly as I was hoping.</li>
            <li> I wanted something affordable That work because most Electric toothbrushes cost a arm and a leg came a cross this one.</li>
            <li> First, the package was already opened.</li>
            <li> I have bought many stuffs from Amazon and it&#x27;s the first time I received a product in such an opened package.</li>
            <li> Second, and more suspiciously, the toothbrush gets no energy at all, which in my experience is abnormal for a rechargeable electric product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> On my first day, my first thought was that it was scary-percussive.</li>
            <li> Especially since I got everything so cheap!</li>
            <li> I did have a problem with the first one I ordered.  </li>
            <li> I was looking for a quality toothbrush that was not too expensive and the Oral-B toothbrush was a perfect match.  </li>
            <li> However, I was able to buy this from my local chain drugstore for $15.00 cheaper.</li>
            <li> Check locally first on this item.</li>
            <li> This is a replacement for an Oral-B that finally died after many years of service.  </li>
            <li> My dentist will be pleased with my next check up.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Oral-B toothbrushes for several years and love how they work.</li>
            <li> To be honest, most of the time on my 5000 I just use the regular speed, so there&#x27;s no real loss of functionality with the 1000 model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li> As is true with most Oral B electric brushes you can use a wide varietiy of brush heads to suit your needs.</li>
            <li> I love the 30 second interval reminders.</li>
            <li> and I love it for the gums especially.</li>
            <li> On top of that, I went back to my Dentist and they didnt have to srap</li>
            <li> It is easy to use, even for the whole family and so simple to clean.</li>
            <li> Thanks to Oral-B!</li>
            <li> Charges fast!</li>
            <li> My first Oral-B was purchased in 2001, a Plaque Remover 3-D.</li>
            <li> I really can feel the difference!</li>
            <li> B brushes are great because the replacement brushes tend to be cheaper than the Sonicare counterparts thereby being cheaper in the long run as well as the initial buy.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It will feel funny at first.  </li>
            <li> I first started looking at the product it was about $39 dollars.</li>
            <li> So I bought it just in case it went higher</li>
            <li> A full charge lasts about 9 days before the light goes red to let you know to charge it.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described.  </li>
            <li> I tend to find the Philips sonicare cleans the most similar.</li>
            <li> I really do hope this wasn&#x27;t it!  </li>
            <li> This is the only model I&#x27;ve used, but I&#x27;m glad it&#x27;s the one I bought.</li>
            <li> It works better than a regular toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> This is my first electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Takes a while to charge it the first time.</li>
            <li> They really are brushing!  </li>
            <li> It is my first electric toothbrush</li>
            <li> My first electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> After reading multiple reviews on all the many electric toothbrushes out there, I chose this one for my husband and me.</li>
            <li> I went to my orthodontist for the first time after two months of owning this</li>
            <li> If something comes up in the future, I&#x27;ll be sure to update my review.</li>
            <li> This is the first electric toothbrush that I have ever used.</li>
            <li> If it lasts as long as my last Oral/Braun, great.  </li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s not my first Oral-B electric toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> This is my first electric toothbrush ever.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this, don&#x27;t spend more $ on a SonicCare.</li>
            <li> This is the first electric toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li> it takes quite awhile (up to 22 hours) for the first charge.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, after my research, I decided this brush offered the best value without going overboard on silly features.  </li>
            <li> Then I found out my wife had ordered the twin pack for $50..a better deal and double the pulses per minute from this one.</li>
            <li> well truthfully, i bought this because i didnt want to drop double the $ on sonicare--</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used battery powered brushes before, but my dentist said an electric brush was better.</li>
            <li> Fits in your mouth much better than the rectangular head of a regular toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had oral B toothbrushes before and they were of much higher quality.</li>
            <li> I used to have a higher model but decided to try the this model.</li>
            <li> This one doesn&#x27;t vibrate compared to the higher level model....</li>
            <li> Not much to go wrong.</li>
            <li> In short, it has its minor flaws, but so far I&#x27;m satisfied that I got a good toothbrush for the price.</li>
            <li> But this product is pre-destined to be discarded after a couple/three years, so why pretend it needs more build quality than is necessary for a throw-away consumer item?</li>
            <li> And I already mentioned that the fancy features of the higher end models make no sense to me.&lt;br</li>
            <li> So glad that it had an alternate brush head for her to use.  </li>
            <li> My wife and I like this brush much better than the Sonicare E-series that we used for several years.  </li>
            <li> I also found the settings to be comfortable on my teeth ( I do not have sensitive teeth) .</li>
            <li> -I can&#x27;t be the only one in the house with sexy teeth.</li>
            <li> Overall I am pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> It works okay, but the charge only lasts a week--instead of the three weeks</li>
            <li> He has braces and this stands up pretty well to the hardware.</li>
            <li> Seems to operate at higher speed than model it replaced.  </li>
            <li> But, I did have the first electric brush for 4 years.</li>
            <li> I am sure I was not the only one who got fooled.</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> After 5 years the battery in the first one decided it was time to retire.  </li>
            <li> Product is exactly as shown.</li>
            <li> This is my first electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> My checkups at the dentist prove it works better than regular brushing.</li>
            <li> if you use this for more than one person, upgrade to the next model.  </li>
            <li> After using it just 3 times, I noticed that my teeth really FEEL cleaner!  </li>
            <li> First, I would like to say that the stand in the picture is not the stand you receive.</li>
            <li> make sure you have a 110v outlet (for international buyers)</li>
            <li> It comes with a simple stand recharger that fits in the corner of the counter top.  </li>
            <li> It is leagues better than using a standard toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I love the timer that alerts you every 30 seconds, it keep me from brushing the same spot when I am daydreaming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Exactly as described and delivery was prompt.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I am using an electric toothbrush</li>
            <li> my first electronic toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> It is my second Oral-B,even better than my first.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re pretty consistent in quality.</li>
            <li> The price of the brushes is another win for Oral-B...at least $4 cheaper than Sonicare per brush.  </li>
            <li> This is my first electric toothbrush</li>
            <li> I concur with most of the reviews I found, about no need for any further bells and whistles.</li>
            <li> The nearest retail stores have this same brush for $20 more.  </li>
            <li> The first time I went to my dentist, I hadn&#x27;t been to one in well over a year.</li>
            <li> We purchased two of these, and from the first use on, both would start and stop.</li>
            <li> This is my first electric toothbrush</li>
            <li> The one drawback will be the higher price for replacement spinning heads.</li>
            <li> So, I don&#x27;t know how many years the battery will last, before I must buy another one.</li>
            <li> The first time I used this product</li>
            <li> My first one just gave out.</li>
            <li> so you can tell one from another if more than two people in a household use the same product.</li>
            <li> The only downfall is it seems to drip a bit more water while I am brushing my teeth.</li>
            <li> First my Pros and Cons</li>
            <li> This is my first rechargable toothbrush.</li>
            <li> My first one lasted eight years.</li>
            <li> lost first one at hotel in bangcock).</li>
            <li> I was astounded the first time I used it.</li>
            <li> The first lasted for years before the battery no longer held a charge.  </li>
            <li> This model had both but not like a higher price model.  </li>
            <li> Would recommend to any one interested in one.</li>
            <li> Features include four 30 second cycles that are for the four quadrents of your mouth, and a pressure sensor to make sure you don&#x27;t brush too hard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> We bought our first one of these about 15 years ago.  </li>
            <li> but it actually goes around the tooth a lot better.  </li>
            <li> My last oral b lasted for many years.</li>
            <li> No complaints ;-)</li>
            <li> But after a few days, it seems to be a good product.</li>
            <li> Good for your teeth and gums,  gives the just came from the hygienist feel everyday.</li>
            <li> In any case, I love this new brush - it&#x27;s more \\&quot;powerful\\&quot; than the old one and has a smaller footprint on the bathroom counter.  </li>
            <li> Very powerful brushing action, prompts you to switch quadrant, has wear indicators, not expensive.  </li>
            <li> After the first time brushing my teeth with this gem my teeth felt as clean as if I just left the dentist for a teeth clean.</li>
            <li> Nice, portable, easy to use toothbrush; battery last for a long time (about a week) .</li>
            <li> My husband says he loves his new tooth brush more than his old oral b vitality tooth brush.</li>
            <li> If you are new to this kind of toothbrush, you will immediately feel the difference from regular brush.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The new one has nice blue color and a led to indicate when charging.&lt;br /&gt;We also have a years supply of brush heads for it.</li>
            <li> The Oral-B Professional 1000 is very useful, and I am thinking about getting a newer generation.</li>
            <li> Without being able to remove the toothbrush, the unit is too tall to fit into a typical bathroom cabinet shelf, unless you rearrange the shelves and everything on them.  </li>
            <li> The precision clean brush head is not too hard or soft and does a great job.  </li>
            <li> I have been using the Original Oral-B 3D Electric toothbrush for about the last 5 years and have been loving it before it finally died.</li>
            <li> I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT TO ANYONE WHO REALLY WANTS CLEAN TEETH.</li>
            <li> It takes a long time to get fully charged, and seems to lose power a lot sooner than expected, but otherwise, it does provide a good cleaning!</li>
            <li> My husband and kids are happily still using their SMART SERIES with an LCD panel that tells them if they are pressing too hard.</li>
            <li> , I always feel ready for bed when I use this, I also love how it comes with a charger, no batteries to mess and fumble with, easy and convenient.</li>
            <li> I can tell a difference between this and a regular brush, my teeth are squeaky clean, but I&#x27;ve not made it to my dentist to see if the claims are true of reversing periodontal disease...</li>
            <li> my teeth are always left feeling very clean</li>
            <li> Good toothbrush, just wondering how well the battery can last, works fine now, but I had one previously and after a while the battery performance just dwells.</li>
            <li> I was initially worried about the small diameter of the brush heads, but the size turned out to be perfect and my teeth feel much cleaner after using this brush than they ever did with a manual.  </li>
            <li> had the higher level more expensive model with 2 additional settings that I never used.&lt;br /&gt;Quality and good value.</li>
            <li> but it is a lot noisier than other electric toothbrush I&#x27;ve own.</li>
            <li> I was really pleased to find that this one worked at a higher frequency than the old one, and the result was that my mouth felt considerably cleaner after use.</li>
            <li> My old Braun toothbrush heads fit on this and works just fine, and the main brush handle also fits the old charger and charges also.</li>
            <li> The handle is very comfortable, the battery charge lasts a long time and my teeth are cleaner than when I brush by hand.</li>
            <li> Dental cost down and healthy teeth and gums up!</li>
            <li> This here toothbrush along with some whitening toothpaste, and I have entered a whole new world of clean teeth.  </li>
            <li> This toothbrush had everything I needed, great vibration and agitation of the teeth and gums, a nice recharger, and easy to hold with a small enough head to reach tight places in your mouth.</li>
            <li> (The 1000 model number replaced the 7400 model number which replaced the 3D number, all without any claim of being a new model, but no doubt there have been some updates to it over the years.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon sells a lot of replacement heads that fit this brush (and there are several kinds of heads that fit).  </li>
            <li> this version has a larger head and thus seems more effective than the previous model I had</li>
            <li> Clean and clear.</li>
            <li> I always thought that no electric toothbrush would clean my teeth any better than good old fashioned brushing, but I was totally wrong.  </li>
            <li> My teeth feel really clean after using this device and the plaque along my gum line is nearly gone after just a couple weeks.  </li>
            <li> Gets your teeth almost as clean as a professional cleaning.</li>
            <li> I use a sensitive brush and my teeth feel clean and there is no pain.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s head gently pulsates to break up plaque and rotates to sweep it away, removing up to 2x more plaque than a regular manual brush .</li>
            <li> They all brush the same way and give you the same good results.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> The flashing read light after use indicates that charging is needed and we choose to deplete the battery before recharge although this is unnecessary for good battery life.  </li>
            <li> I upgraded to this model from my old Oral-B and it is MUCH better than my old one.  </li>
            <li> while it is possible to spend much more on an electronic toothbrush, i really doubt you are getting cleaner teeth for</li>
            <li> The brush has last all this time without replacing them although wear and tear is becoming evident.</li>
            <li> I own both the Philips Sonicare Essence 5300 and the Oral-B Professional Care 1000 and have used both extensively.  </li>
            <li> Also, for the cost this is almost just as good as the much more expensive rechargeable toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> overall size of the handle and charger is more compact than the 5000 series making it much easier to pack in a travel</li>
            <li> Its ok, I haven&#x27;t used it much since i switched back to manual brushing!</li>
            <li> It only needs charging (for me) every 10 days and charges quickly after that first full charge.</li>
            <li> I feel the cleaning action is better with the floss action brush.  </li>
            <li> The toothbrush will pause its normal vibration after a certain period of time, and you get a really thorough clean if you follow its lead.</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush, I like how small the head is to make it super easy to clean all angles of the back teeth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m no dental professional, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s wise to pay more for a toothbrush just because it has a little more raw power.</li>
            <li> Also, does not take up too much room on bathroom counter and replacement brushes are very reasonable.  </li>
            <li> Sometimes a light brushing and some flossing or toothpick action would serve you better than long, intense brushing.  </li>
            <li> The fine design leaves few open areas, so no slime can collect as it did in my Sonicare , and it is very easy to keep the electric handle &amp; brush clean after each use..</li>
            <li> this doesn&#x27;t mean that Oral-b is better than Sonicare, it just means I prefer the Oral-b more.</li>
            <li> if you open your mouth just right, it will sound like someone is playing a didgeridoo in your bathroom.</li>
            <li> The value is a good, and they take up very little counter space even in the charger.  </li>
            <li> The 30 second and 2 minute timer pulses are super cool.  </li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t cleaning my teeth like I would like had to upgrade heard positive things about this product.</li>
            <li> The charger is very small, and the product easy to hold and operate (as well as easy to keep clean).</li>
            <li> Well, either that particular feature is not working on this Oral B toothbrush, or I am brushing with the right pressure.  </li>
            <li> If you still notice a smell of bacteria, or just want to make sure to get it extra clean, use very hot water when rinsing or even have a spray bottle of strong alcohol available to spray into the bottom of the brush head before you lay it down to dry out.  </li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Thanks so much!</li>
            <li> It works exactly as intended and holds a charge very well.  </li>
            <li> other great thing about these Oral-B brushes is that they will last 5-7 years before the battery weakens noticeably in power.  </li>
            <li> This is a great replacement for a old similar brush that was finally worn out.</li>
            <li> The most satisfactory purchase of anything that I&#x27;ve made in a long time.</li>
            <li> Much cheaper than the higher models,</li>
            <li> This is my first electronic toothbrush, so can&#x27;t really compare to anything else.  </li>
            <li> I love the fact that it gives you a time for each quadrant you brush which makes me much more careful in brushing all my teeth equally.  </li>
            <li> It takes about 24 hours to charge and recharge which seems long, but not terrible.  </li>
            <li> It is far superior than the other brands I&#x27;ve owned over the years.</li>
            <li> Use the Dual Action, full sized heads for maximum effect, that&#x27;s easier.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I loved that this toothbrush was so affordable compared with the usual $125-$150 electrics out there</li>
            <li> When our old Oral B couldn&#x27;t hold a charge for a full 2 minute brush anymore, we knew it was time to replace it.</li>
            <li> Really good product and the toothbrush head is small</li>
            <li> I really like the 30 second buzz feature to make sure that you aren&#x27;t spending too much time on one part of your mouth.</li>
            <li> I really shopped around for a good toothbrush, and although this was not the most expensive model I looked at it</li>
            <li> /&gt;It takes a long time to charge up fully the first time, but that&#x27;s a good thing since the charger is not forcing a lot of current into the battery.</li>
            <li> The only down side is the induction recharging, which requires a good 15 to 17 hours for full recharge.</li>
            <li> A small easy travel charging dock (if you are going to be gone for more than 5 days and have to possibly need to recharge), and easy to understand battery indicators.</li>
            <li> The miser in me wants to continue until the head simply falls apart, but it&#x27;s much better to just break down and get a new one at that point, thereby avoiding the discomfort, and getting back to enjoying the luxury of a nice electronic toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I get the same squeaky clean fresh feeling after I brush using either the Oral-b or Sonicare.</li>
            <li> but that is fine as I only use it on higher speed.</li>
            <li> An older model Oral B toothbrush which I have had for many years recently started quitting almost every time I used it.  </li>
            <li> find this brush to be a much better design than an older electric brush we had years back.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Using different technologies and approaches, Oral-b&#x27;s high-end toothbrushes like the PC 1000 improve your oral hygiene not only by having a stronger action than the cheap competition (including its own low-cost vibrating toothbrushes),</li>
            <li> Good price, but they seem very firm.</li>
            <li> Still using this toothbrush til this day, bought it many years ago, works and functions great, kind of annoying now to brush my teeth using a regular manual toothbrush.</li>
            <li> one more cute observation--when looking to buy this toothbrush, I did also check a well-known internet auction site--yes, that one--and was very surprised to observe that in addition to Sellers offering new units, some sellers were offering \\&quot;slightly used\\&quot; electric Oral-B Pro Care model 1000 toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> Just one more cute observation--when looking to buy this toothbrush, I did also check a well-known internet auction site--yes, that one--and was very surprised to observe that in addition to Sellers offering new units, some sellers were offering \\&quot;slightly used\\&quot; electric Oral-B Pro Care model 1000 toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> The motion of the brush head is comfortable even on my sensitive teeth although it seems clumsily large, and only my next checkup will tell how effective it is in cleaning my teeth.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a fun new &amp;#34;toy&amp;#34; for them.</li>
            <li> As many reviewers have said, the brush can be a bit rough at first, but you get used to it.</li>
            <li> Much quieter than the older Oral-B toothbrush I had been using (whose battery finally gave up after many years of use).</li>
            <li> Cochrane does meta-analyses and they are very conservative, which means that when they say something, it is pretty much true.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can get to the back teeth easily without gaging myself.  </li>
            <li> &amp; she couldn&#x27;t believe that I could get to the back teeth so easily.  </li>
            <li> &amp; she couldn&#x27;t believe that I could get to the back teeth so easily.  </li>
            <li> the funtion is simple and easy to use.</li>
            <li> I can easily change the type of various brush heads depending upon what function I want to perform.&lt;br /&gt;More</li>
            <li> I feel they clean better especially hard-to-reach places like the back teeth.</li>
            <li> There are numerous features, but it&#x27;s easy to use.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s easy to reach areas that regular toothbrushes can not reach</li>
            <li> We pop the head off after every use and dry the end with a towel just to make sure we keep things clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This toothbrush was easy to figure out, and definitely does the job.</li>
            <li> Easy to find and replace brushes when necessary.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use; stays charged for several weeks;</li>
            <li> The smaller head makes it a lot easier to get the backside of the molars, and the different heads allow me to get a deeper and more thorough clean between my teeth and along the gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;There is a wide assortment of heads available as this toothbrush works with the full line of oral b heads.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s easy enough to charge it up.</li>
            <li> Alternatively, you would color one ring with fingernail polish and let it dry before putting it on a brush head, or just use some colored tape around one or more of them in your bathroom.</li>
            <li> My two previous electric Oral-B toothbrushes has a nice feel in my hand size-wise.</li>
            <li> It is conpact, can reach the back side of the the teeth, easy handle and cleans well</li>
            <li> The rest of my family uses the very prominent and considerably more expensive alternative whose name rhymes with tonic share.  </li>
            <li> This toothbrush works well enough - it&#x27;s not as fast as the better Oral-B models, but it does a decent job.</li>
            <li> I strongly recommend that if you only want to spend about 40 dollars, get the sonicare essence 5600 or whatever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Philips uses sonic technology that causes the brush to vibrate extremely fast without it actually moving much; this subtle quality creates a more pleasant brushing experience than the Oral-B.  </li>
            <li> The replacement brushes last a long time and good quality.  </li>
            <li> A year later and still going strong.</li>
            <li> Provides strong cleaning power and charges last through a week vacation.</li>
            <li> I do strongly recommend this product for the following reasons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Works great, this is my second one, wouldn&#x27;t have any other!</li>
            <li> The power fades in and out at certain angles.</li>
            <li> Would certainly buy it again and recommend it to a friend.</li>
            <li> certainly don&#x27;t have recourse...</li>
            <li> I was looking for certain features - timer, pressure sensor.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t hold a charge as long as I would like and recharging takes the better part of a day, but for the price I really can&#x27;t complain too much about that.  </li>
            <li> your entire attitude towards brushing; while the cost of it is not much more than what you would pay for not too many of Oral-b&#x27;s own vibrating manual</li>
            <li> your entire attitude towards brushing; while the cost of it is not much more than what you would pay for not too many of Oral-b&#x27;s own vibrating manual toothbrushes.    </li>
            <li> I have purchased two of the above Oral-B Professional 1000 Toothbrushes and received two letters stating that I must send original UPC barcodes with the original receipt and application in order to receive the $20 rebate.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this for myself from Walmart a few years ago &amp; LOVE it!</li>
            <li> The new one (1000) has a smaller charging station, which I thought would be more convenient for travel.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the new one as well, but my old model is no longer available.</li>
            <li> The new model helps me to keep cleaning my teeth with a more regular and even hand.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s also easy to clean, which is one of the problems that I had with my previous model of Oral-B electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Miss the holder for multiple brushes I had with my previous unit, otherwise happy with purchase.  </li>
            <li> I have used a previous model Oral-B electric toothbrush, but this one is far superior.  </li>
            <li> Best toothbrush, easy to charge, corded base.</li>
            <li> Really strong Brush and the only thing is that the replacement Brushes cost almost just as much as the brush itself.</li>
            <li> Recommended by my dentist for inflamed gums [so embarrassing] and it is far superior to my previous brush.  </li>
            <li> Oral-B. Easy and tiny to use and reasonable price.</li>
            <li> A good value if you need only a single unit and solo charger.</li>
            <li> All in all a good tooth brush, just a shame that it only comes with a single head</li>
            <li> It can easily take 16 hours for a full charge when run down.</li>
            <li> /&gt;- Cheap, portable, powerful and easy to handle&lt;br /&gt;con:&lt;br /&gt;- little bit loud, no setting to adjust the rotation speed.</li>
            <li> (brush heads that worked on the old brush all work on this new brush, another nice thing for them to have left alone!).</li>
            <li> Seems like a fine basic electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Works fine, does the job, simple, no problem.</li>
            <li> I have the higher end version of this toothbrush that has the timer display and many other features.  </li>
            <li> For less money than we spent 3 years ago on our old one, we got a great toothbrush!</li>
            <li> Surely a Braun product should be lasting more than 2 and a half years.  </li>
            <li> Battery life - pretty decent</li>
            <li> I replaced my older Oral B model with this one and what a difference!  </li>
            <li> of my personal dental hygiene recommendations:  Be a bit careful about using baking soda or toothpastes with strong abrasives if you are an &#x27;over-brusher&#x27; which can cause even more worn enamel.  </li>
            <li> As usual, Amazon&#x27;s service was exceptional.</li>
            <li> Does a great job, I do throw the head that comes with it away and use a sensitive, softer head (better for the gums, less harsh).  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use, easy to keep charged, has a wealth of bristle choices, takes up a small footprint, and seems to work well.</li>
            <li> Simple, easy to charge, easy to wash and to replace the brushes, the battery lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> He said I was brushing too hard, and that this brush would help keep a good firmness and cleanliness to my brushing.  </li>
            <li> The extra thrills of the smart series will not be used by most consumers (sensitive and polishing cycles, feedback display, etc).</li>
            <li> This new unit cleans my teeth exceptionally well, is stoutly built, and should last at least as many years as its predecessor.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The 1st was great, but was powered by two AA batteries, and I felt bad going through so many of them over time.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a light on the brush that flashes red when it&#x27;s ready to be recharged.  </li>
            <li> Just as effective as the more expensive units.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There is only one speed which isn&#x27;t a huge issue.  </li>
            <li> I also noticed a huge difference when I floss afterwards (without getting too gross).</li>
            <li> This difference is huge and on close inspection, I noticed the Oral-B left my teeth cleaner.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> very well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My teeth just feel so much cleaner with the Oral-B.  </li>
            <li> and I really like it.  </li>
            <li> you really do get that straight from the dentist feel after every use.  </li>
            <li> i would absolutely recommend it to anyone.  </li>
            <li> It does of course cost twice as much, but comes with a travel case and two brush heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is a toothbrush that is really just as advertised</li>
            <li> To my dismay, the speed it too fast and after using it my, teeth hurt for days, not the gums, just the teeth.</li>
            <li> I have bought two of this,and I like it so much.</li>
            <li> You can tell its activated because the brush will sound different.  </li>
            <li> Works really well, need to take your time.</li>
            <li> Too much vibration&lt;br /&gt;can</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t like having to toss or recycle the whole handle because the battery can&#x27;t be replaced when it dies after a couple of years.</li>
            <li> This works very well</li>
            <li> The low battery indicator light does not flash when i push the on button.</li>
            <li> Apparently it is possible to replace the batteries if you&#x27;re comfortable handling circuit boards and soldering guns</li>
            <li> Oral-B is highly recommended by me!</li>
            <li> The newer slender handle design is much easier to manuveur</li>
            <li> to be purchased separately) cleans all surfaces very well,&lt;br /&gt;very</li>
            <li> /&gt;It fits very well in the hand and mouth.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed was that the oscillating action of the brush is pretty intense.  </li>
            <li> very soon.&lt;br</li>
            <li> From what I can tell, it&#x27;s primarily cosmetic changes - and the 1000 only has one speed instead of two on the 3D</li>
            <li> The amount of time that my dental hygenist spends cleaning my teeth is much lower since I started using the Excel.  </li>
            <li> I dont recommend that you re-charge it after every use because it will kill the battery much faster.</li>
            <li> it really makes me feel upset.</li>
            <li> really?  </li>
            <li> It makes brushing a lot easier and you don&#x27;t have to think as much about what you&#x27;re doing.</li>
            <li> The motor for this isn&#x27;t quite precise enough</li>
            <li> /&gt;3)You can buy generic brush heads for $6.45 free shipping.</li>
            <li> It cleans my teeth very well.</li>
            <li> Reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I waited for over a month before doing this review because I wanted to see if this really works</li>
            <li> but I am very hopeful that this will happen.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it is ready to go.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This does not happen very</li>
            <li> When she was later scaling my teeth roots, she said they were smooth like glass.</li>
            <li> It vibrates so much that I couldn&#x27;t stand brushing my teeth.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Because they cant really move their hands easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Shipping completed in a very timely manner.</li>
            <li> and it generally get full charge by morning</li>
            <li> fast delivery</li>
            <li> I really like the Charge indicator that reminds me to take it out of my shower and place it on the charger.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband and he absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li> I really like knowing I have a variety of heads to choose from.</li>
            <li> works very well, and I count on it on every&lt;br /&gt;day now.</li>
            <li> I also never felt the toothbrush losing power or become weaker when the red light came on to tell me to charge it.</li>
            <li> so much I bought one for my husband and another for my son.</li>
            <li> And it is posted fast.</li>
            <li> I really line it and would recommend it to anyone in the market for this type of product.</li>
            <li> they get real nastee where to brush attaches (see reviews for the entry level sonic care for details)</li>
            <li> This toothbrush works very well for the money.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Independent of my prompting, my dentist also recommended this very toothbrush, reinforcing my belief in its goodness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This toothbrush works really well.</li>
            <li> , I really like it.</li>
            <li> I really like this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> The charge lasts for a whole week so you can bring the brush</li>
            <li> Oh, and it really does remove surface stains on the teeth.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t have much to compare it to, but I really like it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a mom on the run and don&#x27;t always have a lot of time to really brush well.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> I figured it&#x27;s the wiggling that does all of the work, so why not use a vibrating toothbrush to gently caress out my cares?</li>
            <li> Mr. Nippers really seems to like our massage sessions.</li>
            <li> And his wheel running has been much looser and easy-going since we started.</li>
            <li> It osculates much slower, but it still gets the job done.  </li>
            <li> Really helps gum health as well.</li>
            <li> and you really feel the difference.</li>
            <li> It is much lighter and the stand does not take up much space on the counter.  </li>
            <li> Oh and it&#x27;s much quieter than my wife&#x27;s Sonicare</li>
            <li> I notice that 2 minutes seems to go by much faster now</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re savvy enough, use the battery disposal instructions and take everything apart gently (primarily \\&quot;breaking\\&quot; the cap off the bottom and don&#x27;t use a screwdriver to pry the circuit board away from the battery).</li>
            <li> really like this oral b.  </li>
            <li> Very noisy but gets the job done.  </li>
            <li> it absolutely does.</li>
            <li> My teeth are very close together</li>
            <li> much prefer it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had electric toothbrushes b/4, but this really, really cleans my teeth &amp; massages my gums.</li>
            <li> If you absolutely prefer brush storage with your electric brush - this isn&#x27;t for you.</li>
            <li> The timing feature works very well and</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this toothbrush!</li>
            <li> however I must say that Amazon customer service was really helpful in the end</li>
            <li> you guessing as to how much time on each area.</li>
            <li> You can really feel the difference.</li>
            <li> The charging station is very convienent.</li>
            <li> Just what I wanted at a reasonable cost.</li>
            <li> Works even better than expected.  </li>
            <li> Toothbrush came in fast.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> While it is working, it cleans really well</li>
            <li> Brushes really well</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel like this cleans my teeth very well.  </li>
            <li> this product so much bought another identical one.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s gentle but noticible.  </li>
            <li> but he tried mine and also really noticed the difference</li>
            <li> and he really loves it as well.  </li>
            <li> so doesn&#x27;t take up much space in the bathroom.</li>
            <li> and they seemed to find a reasonable amount of tartar to scrape off each time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and they seemed to find a reasonable amount of tartar to scrape off each time.    </li>
            <li> I was surprised that a smaller brush head could be so much more efficient, but indeed it was compared with my SoniCare electric toothbrush which costs twice as much.</li>
            <li> I really like that option for this because my bf and I were going to share it.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;- VERY durable</li>
            <li> So the Precision 1000 works really well.</li>
            <li> i really like it.</li>
            <li> after some days it really can whiten my tooth.</li>
            <li> so the whole apartment does not hear me brush my teeth.</li>
            <li> Even flossing wouldn&#x27;t get rid of all of the plaque on my teeth, and my gums were receding because of it, but now even when I pick at my gum-line gently, there&#x27;s no tarter build-up at all.  </li>
            <li> and how much it helped, does take along time to charge up</li>
            <li> It came really fast amd</li>
            <li> It spends much faster than you could ever move your manual brush.</li>
            <li> Works very well.</li>
            <li> so I have to continually inhale gently to keep spit from coming out through the toothbrush head.</li>
            <li> Wait until the low battery light flashes.</li>
            <li> Bought this product on my hygienist&#x27;s recommendation and absolutely cannot believe the difference.  </li>
            <li> so I expected I&#x27;d need to buy the Sensitive brush heads for the 1000, but I&#x27;m happy with the standard brush head that came with the 1000.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> one issue I have with my 1000 is that I tried to test the pressure sensor alert to see what the result would be and what level of pressure the brush considers to be too much.</li>
            <li> oh, never mind.ert to see what the result would be and what level of pressure the brush considers to be too much.</li>
            <li> Works really well.  </li>
            <li> and your teeth actually feel cleaner, almost as smooth as just coming from the dentist.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is designed so that you work on one quadrant of your mouth at a time and eventually trains you to the tempo of how much time to spend on each tooth.  </li>
            <li> Oral-B has a round brush that acts more like a jackhammer in that it is much more physical and vigorous than the Philips.  </li>
            <li> I really need that?\\</li>
            <li> I really like tongue cleaner attachments, so I also managed to order the Mouthcare Essentials kit for $18.99/free ship from Bonanza</li>
            <li> - what really bugs me is the depth of the fat stem.</li>
            <li> - what really bugs me is the depth of the fat stem.</li>
            <li> This was recommended by my periodontist, and it really makes your teeth &amp;#34;dentist clean&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> I feel like it stimulates the gums and really cleans inside the pockets.  </li>
            <li> This product is really what a needed.</li>
            <li> It is made in Germany, so I expect it to last a lot longer than the cheaply made products from China.  </li>
            <li> Light, simple and as described.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> The handle design has not changed much.</li>
            <li> Four brush heads are available, with different designs &amp; functions.</li>
            <li> /&gt;*Cleans your teeth and gums really well</li>
            <li> If too much pressure is applied the head stops spinning until pressure is relieved.  </li>
            <li> Really, there isn&#x27;t anything else you&#x27;d need.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Really like it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> i can think of is when the battery gets weaker, so does the oscillation as well -- probably have to charge it before the red light starts flashing to maintain the intensity of the oscilliation&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;all</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Really cleans and tells you when to advance to another section of your teeth.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> The buzzing sound is highly reminiscent of a dentist&#x27;s drill and took some getting used to.</li>
            <li> My teeth feel so much cleaner just like I came from the dentist.</li>
            <li> When you look in the stores, they often will only have one Oral B model available.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> I really like how the toothbrush works for me.</li>
            <li> It is gentle on the teeth and gums.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> You really get that just-been-to-the-dentist feeling.</li>
            <li> this is very aggressive.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Really?</li>
            <li> No unnecessary extras which I&#x27;ll never use, and which drain power.  </li>
            <li> it was a no brainer really.</li>
            <li> but it still gets the job done, highly recommended!</li>
            <li> or you really notice the brush heads wearing out.</li>
            <li> You could not possibly do worse.</li>
            <li> I really like it.</li>
            <li> holds its charge &amp; doesn&#x27;t take up much space in cabinet.</li>
            <li> but it is just a gentle change in the speed of the brushing.  </li>
            <li> I really like this brush, so I reordered.  </li>
            <li> They really like it.</li>
            <li> I chose it because of the cost and because I didn&#x27;t want to invest too much in case he didn&#x27;t like an electric toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> brush, slender, charger stand does  not take up much room on the counter.</li>
            <li> I really like this brush.  </li>
            <li> Very suprised at speed.  </li>
            <li> heads are reasonably priced.&lt;br /&gt;Lets</li>
            <li> reminder to move to another quadrant is gentle.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve used it now three days and dislike it so much it&#x27;s headed for the trash bin).</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s really helpful.</li>
            <li> You need only use a light touch and can feel this brush cleaning.</li>
            <li> Takes care of the whole tooth nothing but the tooth so help me.</li>
            <li> In my opinion, it cleans very well.</li>
            <li> But it also feels a bit \\&quot;cheaper\\&quot;, and the light blue color isn&#x27;t attractive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very happy!&lt;br</li>
            <li> This was much cheaper (</li>
            <li> My mouth feels SOOOO much cleaner.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is crazy awesome!!  </li>
            <li> Works very well.</li>
            <li> One charge lasts for over a week, and I really like the timer.</li>
            <li> charges over night, ready to use in the morning.</li>
            <li> My teeth feel so much cleaner than when I brush my teeth by hand.</li>
            <li> The price was reasonable and according to my wife it works very well.</li>
            <li> What has made me very upset about this whole experience is the rebate.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t bother me so much to have lost $20.</li>
            <li> i really like the quality of this toothbrush for the price</li>
            <li> Also, it really massages the gum-line very well, too.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t mind this so much, were there anywhere on the page where it said what comes in the package.</li>
            <li> but it really should have come with a travel case.</li>
            <li> After resisting I now feel foolish as this product works very well.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> I know my teeth feel much cleaner, than when I brush with</li>
            <li> I switched to this electric toothbrush and my teeth are so much cleaner.</li>
            <li> you don&#x27;t have to replace the head very often,</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think I would care that I get a reminder to change quandrants, but it is really helpful.</li>
            <li> (rotations are a bit aggressive) and when it&#x27;s about to die (not just by the flashing red light either).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using cheap electric toothbrushes for years, and finally switched to this mid-rage model.  </li>
            <li> My teeth always feel much cleaner now and my gums feel stronger.</li>
            <li> It cleans very well.  </li>
            <li> battery life is reasonable.  </li>
            <li> For me, this makes thorough cleaning much easier than when using a toothbrush with an oval head.</li>
            <li> (btw, I change the heads on these brushes almost monthly because it feels like the plaque builds up so fast now) - she&#x27;s astounded at</li>
            <li> HOW MUCH PLAQUE I HAVE.</li>
            <li> had to send it back the brushing head didnt fit on all the way.</li>
            <li> Also very sanitary in that way.</li>
            <li> Works very well.</li>
            <li> I have used this brand of toothbrush for better than 15 years with absolutely no complaints what so ever.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed much difference between the two except</li>
            <li> difference between the sonic toothbrush and this one is that this one stops spinning if too much pressure is applied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> One minute on each side with gentle pressure cleaned up years of stains and cleaned areas</li>
            <li> Cleans my teeth very well.</li>
            <li> My teeth feel so much cleaner</li>
            <li> feels like it really cleans efficiently</li>
            <li> this one moves so fast I had to get used to it</li>
            <li> Oral B replacement heads are reasonably priced also.</li>
            <li> However, this one really works.  </li>
            <li> My teeth feel much cleaner after using this brush.  </li>
            <li> brush heads are a hollow tube with holes at the top and the bottom, so</li>
            <li> my wife loves it and so do i. thanks again</li>
            <li> Charger works very well.  </li>
            <li> electric toothbrush works very well.</li>
            <li> There are generic brush heads available.</li>
            <li> We bought two of them and fortunately they had different colors to tell them apart.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I still really like my brush</li>
            <li> I do like the powerful vibrations of the brush head, maybe even stronger than my old ones.</li>
            <li> better than expected.</li>
            <li> It is a very low-end product.  </li>
            <li> Product works better than expected.</li>
            <li> would highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> What a difference - holds a charge longer than the instructions say and is much lighter (brush as well as the charger).  </li>
            <li> Even works on the tongue really well.</li>
            <li> It works very well.</li>
            <li> My teeth feel so much cleaner using this brush rather than a manual brush.</li>
            <li> and it holds a charge very well.</li>
            <li> It works much better than the old one and after brushing it feels like I just left the dentist&#x27;s office!</li>
            <li> and my mouth feels fresher compared to using manual brushes (kind of similar feeling after going to the dentist for regular cleaning).</li>
            <li> The motion is really nice, however it is missing the ability to change speeds.</li>
            <li> Oral-B has a number of brushes available - the Sonic, Vitality, the Professional Care family (which comprises the 1000 and 3000), and the Professional Care SmartSeries (4000 and 5000).</li>
            <li> Overall I find the Oral-b 1000 to be a well made, simple to use, and effective electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Simple, silent, effective.</li>
            <li> I had my old Braun/oralB for many years and it finally stopped charging.  </li>
            <li> and I only got 1 cavity (while I used to have more frequently).</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace my many years old one of the same model.  </li>
            <li> You really don&#x27;t need more bells and whistles (including a bigger stand that takes up more space on your counter) than this unit, which uses the same brushes I had on hand from my last Oral-B brush.</li>
            <li> That has never happened to me before because I have not been brushing properly time wise or using the wrong kind of toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> and I think it does at least a good of a job at cleaning my teeth.</li>
            <li> With this model, I just run some warm water over it every few days, and voila.</li>
            <li> I run the brush till the battery is almost dead before i recharge it, this model also has a recharging-charged led which I find handy.</li>
            <li> This oral-b keeps my teeth cleaner, requires minimal maintenance and provides gentle, effective brushing action.</li>
            <li> This is half the cost of the one I replaced, and although it does not have the bells and whistles of the older model, it is every bit as effective when it comes to oral hygiene.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;-Brush heads are easily replaced and last a decent amount of time before needing to be replaced&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I recently purchased the Oral-B Professional Care 1000 and I love it.</li>
            <li> I own a sonic-care and I ordered this as a second brush that brush&#x27;s differently (circular)</li>
            <li> The brush head seems small at first but is totally effective.</li>
            <li> Far better than my last Oral-B&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I suppose that&#x27;s where the \\&quot;precision\\&quot; comes into play -- it was far easier to get in all the crevices and corners than with a standard toothbrush -- but it also meant I found myself more than once clanging the plastic edge of the head against my enamel.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I like it, but I don&#x27;t like the round headed brush as well as I liked the rectangular headed Oral B that this one replaced.  </li>
            <li> I had an old Oral B electric toothbrush that finally died after many years.  </li>
            <li> but if you do a good job on each tooth with a plain old manual toothbrush, I would probably save my money.</li>
            <li> I got this toothbrush about a month and a half ago to replace a Sonic Care one that died on me and so far I love it even more than my old one when it was new.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this toothbrush for anyone that wants to have superbly clean teeth in general and for anyone with sensitivity issues.</li>
            <li> or more twice a day for a week, my teeth felt extra clean similar to the feeling I get after I&#x27;ve received a professional teeth cleaning.  </li>
            <li> After the first brush with this new tooth brush, I could feel an immediate difference.  </li>
            <li> so far I have to say I made the right choice.</li>
            <li> It vibrates very quickly and has a long battery life between charges.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure I would like the tiny head on it, but I can easily see that I have lots less tartar...</li>
            <li> If your teeth are used to a good scrubbing there is no need to even use anything other than the standard brush</li>
            <li> I replaced an older more expensive model but this one seems to be as effective</li>
            <li> As the review on The Wirecutter mentions, and as confirmed with a simple search, the sonic toothbrushes are really just a marketing gimmick and all the extra cleaning options don&#x27;t really add any true</li>
            <li> have found my teeth to feel reallllllly clean after using this brush, that super smooth and slick just had them professionally cleaned feeling.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> as stated&lt;br /&gt;-different brush heads are all essentially the same, except for the flossing one which actually works pretty good</li>
            <li> First off it very loud.  </li>
            <li> These are far better than the old model, which we thought was pretty terrific.</li>
            <li> The brush is much quieter than the older model that I use and it is much slimer.</li>
            <li> but once I did, I feel like I&#x27;m REALLY getting my teeth clean, finally!!!</li>
            <li> This one is simple and straightforward.  </li>
            <li> after call finally led to \\&quot;please resend the original paperwork.....</li>
            <li> I notice that a lot of the negative comments mention it, so apparently it&#x27;s either more pronounced in some units than others, or many folks just aren&#x27;t as bothered by it.</li>
            <li> This is an item I would glad recommend to other of my friends and family&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> When I other Oral-B died after many years use</li>
            <li> I purchased this product to replace my original Oral-B rechargeable that finally wore out after 16 years.</li>
            <li> After one month of brushing teeth and before using a traditional tooth brush, I noticed a significant improvement.</li>
            <li> Originally purchased the Oral-B 1000 at a big box retailer as it was on sale at a price lower than Amazon.  </li>
            <li> So much better than the other brand.</li>
            <li> get a letter back saying the rebate request is incomplete because they did not receive an original UPC--can I please send it.</li>
            <li> And, believe it or not, my original Oral-B just recently died after over 20 YEARS use twice a day by 2 people.</li>
            <li> (admittedly it takes a long time for each charge, but that&#x27;s not a big deal), and is easy to clean.</li>
            <li> one benefit of using electronic toothbrushes is that people spend more time brushing their teeth with electronic toothbrushes than with manual toothbrushes, so there&#x27;s a decent chance that other electronic toothbrushes might, in the real world, outperform manual toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li> I was additionally pleased that the Oral-B/Braun folks still use the same size charger -- I set the new brush on the old charger and it started charging immediately</li>
            <li> I brush twice a day but even if I forget to brush one night, the next morning my teeth STILL feel clean.  </li>
            <li> One word can only describe how clean this toothbrush cleans your teeth....</li>
            <li> Works fine and holds charge really long.</li>
            <li> Peppy brush and works well to clean up back teeth.</li>
            <li> So overall, I do recommend this brush as it does seem to clean well.</li>
            <li> Should have taken care of my older units as I feel their build quality used to be much higher.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My teeth have never felt so clean or looked as white.</li>
            <li> /&gt;You&#x27;ll reach all the way back to clean</li>
            <li> Its pretty fun actually.</li>
            <li> my teeth are clean and it&#x27;s helping my gums that use to bleed when I brushed my teeth.</li>
            <li> Simple to keep clean.</li>
            <li> I took it on a week long business trip without the charger and worked fine through out.</li>
            <li> This is a toothbrush for those who wanna keep their teeth clean as possible!</li>
            <li> Was looking for a toothbrush to clean the back of my rear teeth.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> Easy to clean and small on the counter.</li>
            <li> Used to be my mouth only felt this clean after a dentist visit.</li>
            <li> particular what type of toothpaste used or the heads would wear out really fast.&lt;br /&gt;Hard</li>
            <li> This 1000 model only proves the company upgrades performance  and quality consistently.</li>
            <li> I do not feel as clean when I use a regular toothbrush.</li>
            <li> The price was pretty steep for me when compared to a regular tooth brush, but now seeing the performance was worth it.  </li>
            <li> charge also seems to take awhile, although this is an issue that I had mainly because my bathroom doesn&#x27;t really have any outlets, so I had to charge the toothbrush in a separate room.</li>
            <li> my teeth feel clean and they look white</li>
            <li> (Target sold these for 39 bucks for a while)&lt;br /&gt;-different brush head designs available (over half a dozen) for different cleaning styles (also a con)&lt;br /&gt;-rechargeable&lt;br /&gt;-cleans better than manual brushes</li>
            <li> He says it gives his teeth a deeper clean than a regular toothbrush.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re an average American, high-end electric toothbrushes and water picks have always been things you saw in movies on television in the bathrooms of the rich-the people who had good things that you didn&#x27;t have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Admittingly the UV sterialization of the head by Sonicare is a good thing but to me it was not worth the extra cost.  </li>
            <li> really cleans well, would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Happy with Amazon, not happy with new Oral-B.</li>
            <li> But if you don&#x27;t have a big mouth or some special skill which I seem to lack, the machine will CATCH ON YOUR LIPS or even your tongue.  </li>
            <li> Nothing special, no extra setting, just click the button and vibrates.</li>
            <li> These toothbrushes are way better than conventional or battery powered brushes.</li>
            <li> By the way, my dentist says my teeth look better sense using this versus conventional brush.</li>
            <li> This one is a replacement as the other wore out and it is just as good as the one I had for over 10 years with several new features.</li>
            <li> It only has one speed and that is super fast.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s a good thing because you really can wear off enamel from hard and frequent brushing.</li>
            <li> The higher models probably have one too, but I don&#x27;t know how useful they are, and this one little quirk certainly wasn&#x27;t worth the added expense to me</li>
            <li> The higher models probably have one too, but I don&#x27;t know how useful they are, and this one little quirk certainly wasn&#x27;t worth the added expense to me</li>
            <li> is the new age of \\&quot;SMART PRODUCTS\\&quot;:&lt;br /&gt;1)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Oral B Electric Toothbrushes for as long as they were available until my pervious dentist suggested a Phillips Sonicare Electric Toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Light rechargeable and holds the charge a long time.&lt;br</li>
            <li> somewhere in the middle is the sweet spot.  </li>
            <li> somewhere in the middle is the sweet spot.  </li>
            <li> first thing I noticed in Oral-b 100 Professional Care</li>
            <li> you go higher in the Professional Care family</li>
            <li> I left mine unplugged for the first full week until it died completely</li>
            <li> Not much of a surprise however, as the cleaning action of the Oral B is much more vigorous and intense.  </li>
            <li> This one, though, leaves pieces of food between my teeth and along my gum line, even when brushing for the full 2 minutes, in 30 second quadrants.  </li>
            <li> This was the first professional electric toothbrush I ever bought, so I wasn&#x27;t looking to spend a lot of money.</li>
            <li> It did have to charge overnight initially to reach a full charge.</li>
            <li> Also, it is helpful that the &amp;#34;timer&amp;#34; goes off every 30 seconds by changing the brush pattern for 2 seconds - so if you are trying to acheive a full 2 minutes with giving equal attention to areas of the mouth, this is helpful.  </li>
            <li> Brush head seems kind of small.</li>
            <li> The true test will be my next dentist appointment.</li>
            <li> Without renewed charging, a full charge will last 35-40 minutes.</li>
            <li> It has a nice small charger.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace my 12 year old Oral-B tooth brush and it is better than the old one, I will never buy a different brand.</li>
            <li> In addition to the oscillating action of the brush head, that comfortably and cleans each tooth, this model also now has a pulsating action and is an improvement over the 20 year old model.</li>
            <li> So the $20 is true ONLY IF you buy one.</li>
            <li> Very user friendly, portable, and the charge lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> Not bad for instant gratification.</li>
            <li> Also, the new charging unit does not have a place to wrap excess cord like the old one did; and, no, the new handle won&#x27;t fit on the old charging unit.  </li>
            <li> Gentle enough to brush without  hurting my gums, but powerful enough to leave my teeth feeling incredibly clean.  </li>
            <li> So, for me, the single speed on the 1000 was just fine.  </li>
            <li> This thing cleans better, hands down.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m sure helped keep my dentist bills down.</li>
            <li> I was really looking forward to that brush head holder, but since the brush has been delivered I was able to undergo all of the stages of grief and finally have come to accept that I wont be able to proudly display my brush heads next to the charger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Onto</li>
            <li> It takes right at two days undisturbed on the charger to reach a full charge AND from full charge we get 2-3 brushings before the motor runs too slow to be useful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love the small and simply docking/charging station, and how easily the brush head fits onto the toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I forgot my other Oral-B in Europe, so I decided to just get a new one because my teeth just don&#x27;t feel healthy without an electronic toothbrush.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I am not sure how many vibrations/rotations my old brush had, but this one feels like there is more motion overall.</li>
            <li> This new electrical toothbrush really is heaven sent.</li>
            <li> I expect to use the this toothbrush for many years as I did my previous Oral-B toothbrush.</li>
            <li> This one is much better than the previous Oral-B.  </li>
            <li> The instructions recommend unplugging the charger between charges, which is a slight inconvenience, though that should probably be done for most chargers these days.  </li>
            <li> My previous ORAL B gave up after many years of use.  </li>
            <li> previously used a Sonicare Elite that stopped holding a charge for more than a minute after a couple months of use.</li>
            <li> This brush is better than my previous SonicCare electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Even my children have commented how the Oral-B is much better than their previous toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Although I use their top of the line 5000 series at home, I wanted something for travel use that was less bulky.</li>
            <li> My previous Oral-B rotating brush lasted for over 9 years, I just replaced it with the updated version at a much better price than I paid 10 years ago.  </li>
            <li> The older model just showed a dim, steady light to indicate it was working properly.  </li>
            <li> Pleased about the product but after ordered, found one for a lot less money.  </li>
            <li> And it seems to get between the teeth and onto the gums better than my previous one.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a replacement for the Vitality toothbrush which I had previously used and which I was okay with.  </li>
            <li> but since they had four and a half stars, I figured they must be ok, and I&#x27;ll save a lot of money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li> Much better than my previous type...</li>
            <li> replaced an older model with this</li>
            <li> Get a model that uses the same brush heads as the higher-end models and you will get the same cleaning performance.ur teeth better, in my experience.  </li>
            <li> Why I didn&#x27;t replace my older model with this one I don&#x27;t know.</li>
            <li> Bought to replace an older OralB toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> I purchased an Oral-B 1000 to replace an older unit.  </li>
            <li> I had an older model and it held up for 3 years before giving out.  </li>
            <li> Replaced an older model.  </li>
            <li> Decent toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I had an older version of this which eventually died.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in a love hate relationship with Oral B. Product works great</li>
            <li> The 30 sec phases work, but it doesn&#x27;t shut off after 2 minutes...which is nice actually!</li>
            <li> The old one was fantastic, I don&#x27;t know what happened to them over the last 25 years.</li>
            <li> This is a upgrade from a Oral-B older version.</li>
            <li> Simply put, it does a better job at cleaning my teeth than a standard tooth brush.  </li>
            <li> I used to have an older model that had a wall mount kit.  </li>
            <li> We have an older model for 4 toothbrush heads.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace my older and sluggish tooth brush.  </li>
            <li> I bought this toothbrush to replace an older version of it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Had to return -- I could not use for more than a few seconds without developing a headache and nausea, much like motion sickness.</li>
            <li> And that was one of the biggest draws to this product in particular.</li>
            <li> Replaced an older model.</li>
            <li> I believe this is a an older model.  </li>
            <li> You definitely will pay more at your local pharmacy department.</li>
            <li> Personally I prefer a product that has a simple operation without too many frills.</li>
            <li> difference in the smooth-running feel of this nicer tooth-brush versus the cheaper Oral-B one is pretty noticeable - the same level of difference I noticed when going from the cell-type battery brushes to my first Oral-B rechargeable one.  </li>
            <li> Therefore, many of my bathroom items are just outside the door on a small/short bookcase next to an outlet.  </li>
            <li> Price is decent for the quality.</li>
            <li> We bought it to replace an older model which I wish we still had.  </li>
            <li> I have had the Oral-B for several weeks now and works much better than the prior Braun unit.  </li>
            <li> While it lacks several of the more advanced features (the timer display module and various speeds, such as sensitive, gum massage, etc.)</li>
            <li> bells and whistles like the more expensive Oral B models, but a much better value.</li>
            <li> Upgraded to this electric toothbrush from an older model Oral-B.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m comparing this brush to an older OralB 7000DLX model that it was supposed to replace.</li>
            <li> I think it does a decent job.</li>
            <li> Not only is it powerful, it is gentle.  </li>
            <li> I have basically beaten back periodontal disease, such that there is no change for many years now.</li>
            <li> I got my older unit working.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure I often got impatient when brushing with simple brushes and stopped brushing too quickly without some guide to gently remind you that you need to brush for two minutes.  </li>
            <li> These are just refills for the main product.  </li>
            <li> Cheaper than the older version I had</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t spend money on a more expensive model.  </li>
            <li> I have been using Oral-B rechargeable electric toothbrushes for two years now (I have the older model that was replaced by this one)</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is the classic high-performance tool that Oral-B has offered for years with improvement in the streamline design that takes minimum counter space.</li>
            <li> The cleaning action is very vigorous and I feel that it is very cleaning well.</li>
            <li> This is the second one I&#x27;ve owned and it has made a tremendous difference, even my dentist has noticed.</li>
            <li> We were looking for an additional Oral B brush for a decent price.  </li>
            <li> but before I opened it I did a quick search online to read reviews and decided to return it because it only supports 110-130 V power supply</li>
            <li> I love that it flashes red when it needs recharging and hope that this format will help it last longer than the two years my Pulsonic did.  </li>
            <li> This toothbrush replaced an older model which succumbed to time.  </li>
            <li> Brought to replace a older Oral-B toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> Would like to be able to switch heads so that my husband can use the same unit (different head).  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t replaced the brushes yet, which I hear is the most expensive lifetime cost of a brush like this, but for now I&#x27;m totally satisfied.</li>
            <li> My older unit had a plastic travel case.</li>
            <li> I was using my favorite Sonicare toothbrush and flossing daily back then.</li>
            <li> I give it four stars because it only comes with one brush head and no place to store a second one so it cannot feasibly be used by two or more people.</li>
            <li> I had an older version and this replaced it.</li>
            <li> I had an older version of the Oral-B Electric toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> Upgrade from an older model to this.</li>
            <li> If you have an older Oral-B I would recommend upgrading</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended this particular brush for me.</li>
            <li> We chose the oral B electric tooth brush as a replacement for an older model, which still works.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not as strong brushing as I expected.</li>
            <li> It took one day to fully charge, it has very good power ,just don&#x27;t press down to hard on your teeth to much</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is very soft and gentle on my gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had once had an Oral-B Waterpik I had liked-- and a desire to compare the tooth cleaning experience between the sonic and the plain old electric toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Since it seems to be more effective, and cavities and other dental issues are even more expensive (and no fun to remedy), the cost may be worth it.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Either way I&#x27;d HIGHLY recommend this brush.  </li>
            <li> We highly recommend them to anyone looking for an electric toothbrush.</li>

            <li> Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I ordered the 1000 as it was the lowest level of the high powered models.  </li>

            <li> Highly recommend&#x27;</li>

            <li> Would highly recommend this item.</li>
            <li> Also, &#x27;tartar control&#x27; products are highly under-rated in my opinion.  </li>

            <li> I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a first-rate electric tooth brush at a value price.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend  this brush for the price.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Highly Recommended.&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li> I highly recommend Oral B (anything).</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> in all, works as well and highly recommended for first-timers though I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;ll get 20 years of use out of this model.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li> highly recommended.  </li>
            <li> This year I went to the dentist and she highly recommended that I get a Sonic brush.</li>
            <li> Seems to clean teeth well and has a long battery life.</li>
            <li> That said, I still like it better than Sonicare (the vibrating is less intense and I use the sensitive brush head).</li>
            <li> Nice charging stand - the Oral B 1000 can be charged even if some water is present due to its non-metal-on-metal contact between the charger and the brush.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> We are going to start our own basketball team and try to compete against the other families that have done the same.  </li>
            <li> Not too rough and does a fine job removing plaque.  </li>
            <li> Works fine as expected.</li>
            <li> a little more powerful.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The perfomance if this toothbrush is a little better</li>
            <li> We all love the way they work, how they keep their charge, and take up little space on the bathroom vanity.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Spend a little more and get a little more.  </li>
            <li> Raised in a struggling home, I was always taught that a little elbow grease can more than make up for a lot of what you lack otherwise.</li>
            <li> Compared with them, this one seems a little noisier, but not terrible.  </li>
            <li> there was a little more rubber grip on handle</li>
            <li> Also, a little more rubber for the grip would improve comfort and, of course, grip while using the brush.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> second one I have had, the first lasted about 3-4 years!  </li>
            <li> This model is a streamlined version of my old one and gives me the same clean feeling.</li>
            <li> This replaces an older model she had and so far she really likes the performance.</li>
            <li> My teeth don&#x27;t feel clean compared to using a regular brush plus it bothers my sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li> I had previously been using a cheap disposable electric toothbrush from Wal-Mart &amp;#34;Equate.&amp;#34; It seemed to do an okay job, and at least better than what a regular toothbrush could do for me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quiet and has a timer that indicates every 30 seconds by a pause in action so you can thoroughly clean your teeth.  </li>
            <li> In general a like very much this product.</li>
            <li> Highly reviewed and for a reason, replace you normal tooth brush now and make the switch, you wont regret it.</li>
            <li> I admit that I haven&#x27;t actually been WOUNDED yet, but it is certainly disconcerting, and the first couple times it might scare you, so be warned.</li>
            <li> The replacement brush tips I had on hand for my old unit even fit the new one thus saving me the cost of having to purchase different ones for the new unit -- Oral-B replacement brushes aren&#x27;t cheap.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li> The electris toothbrush with the little round brush really works great.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s still a perfectly good electric toothbrush otherwise, though I really did want something that would warn me when I brushed too hard.</li>
            <li> I suggest buying from Amazon directly, instead of from a third-party supplier through Amazon, or from a reliable brick-and-mortar store, to ensure you get the real thing.ack</li>

            <li> Well, I really found out what sonic action is,&lt;br /&gt;even</li>
            <li> I bought Oral-B Professional care 1000 a month ago and really like it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The ORAL-B 1000 PROFESSIONAL CARE electric toothbrush product which I tested for Amazon Vine claims to stop pulsing if too much pressure is put on the teeth.</li>
            <li> I bought two \\&quot;Oral-B Professional Care 1000 Electric Rechargeable Power Toothbrush 1 Count\\&quot;, but I just received one reward card, could you explain it, thanks.</li>
            <li> Easier to keep these clean too - you just take it apart, wash each of the 2 pieces under water, dry with a towel</li>
            <li> His old electric toothbrush wasn&#x27;t doing the job and it was very noisy.</li>
            <li> The 1000 makes my teeth feels much cleaner than my old toothbrush.</li>
            <li> The battery holds a charge very well, so far.</li>
            <li> I found this toothbrush to be of great value over the Sonicare expensive models.</li>
            <li> I get this to replace my old Oral-B electric tootbrush that was on-lne for 10 whole years.</li>
            <li> I can also adjust the pressure so as to get me comfortable and not get it too rough for my gum and teeth.</li>
            <li> When I recharge it, it blinks a green light enough to light up the room.</li>
            <li> When it worked, it was great but it often failed to work for me.&lt;br /&gt;Consequently</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great toothbrush and the replacement heads aren&#x27;t as expensive as some.</li>
            <li> but I felt that the battery was beginning to lose charge quicker than normal</li>
            <li> It does a good job of getting around and between teeth, though the small opening in the plastic casing means, saliva, toothpaste and water will all get in their, which can get gross, unless you rinse well and take the brush head off from time to time to rinse out the inside.</li>
            <li> unlike manual toothbrushes, the PC 1000, helps to keep you honest and following the advice of dental care professionals by automatically reminding you to give each quarter of your mouth equal attention for a total of two minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But, well worth the price when you compare it to similar items.</li>
            <li> My last one lasted more than 10 years, so I&#x27;m hoping this one will be around for a long time.  </li>
            <li> my old battery operated one better, this is not worth the money.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know it&#x27;s a normal problem or</li>
            <li> Kids love them and it helps them know when they have brushes long enough because of the built in timer.  </li>
            <li> dentist feels the round head is better than ones normally found on toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> Regardless, I like the brush, and more so really like the small footprint of the charger.</li>
            <li> After more than 9 months of use, I now have to charge it after about 1 week of brushing for 2-3 min 2-3 times a day, but that&#x27;s how long the manual says it should last anyway.</li>
            <li> This is normal and happens with all electric toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> smile-- not psycho white like the news readers or club floozies ...</li>
            <li> Well worth sending back.</li>
            <li> I never really bought into the whole Oral-b vs. Sonicare debate because technically any electric toothbrush is better than a manual one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been used to a normal toothbrush all these days....</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t seem worth the money with such a limitation.</li>
            <li> This is like a lighter version of that, my teeth feel cleaner than they do with a normal brush</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for a few weeks now and it is so much better than the one I had which required batteries.</li>
            <li> Its powerful and the timer promotes proper brushing.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s definitely an investment worth making.</li>
            <li> and I like the Oral-B much better because of the round brush.  </li>
            <li> At first I thought the price of an electric toothbrush was a bit much, but after using one I will never go back to a manual brush.</li>
            <li> Worth the money with cash back offer.</li>
            <li> The head of this brush is nice and small and the bristles are soft.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t find the sixty second alerts useful</li>
            <li> My teeth have been noticeably cleaner (I was using a normal toothbrush before).  </li>
            <li> and I have to brush it off with a normal brush.</li>
            <li> This feature alone makes this brush worth the purchase over simple brushes.  </li>
            <li> This is my second one, the battery wore out on the first one and it was cheaper to just replace the whole thing.  </li>
            <li> I discovered there are actually various versions of this product, but figuring out what was worth what was impossible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Sometimes I care a lot that an item is cheaper-built, and sometimes I am glad I saved a few dollars.</li>
            <li> After using this toothbrush for a few weeks, I&#x27;m quite pleased with it.</li>
            <li> First time I ever paid this much for a toothbrush; always bought the $10 and under ones at the big box store.  </li>
            <li> Does a nice job, isn&#x27;t too loud, holds a charge for at least a week, has a nice small footprint</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t want a toothbrush I can&#x27;t take with me for more than a few days before the battery dies.</li>
            <li> Appears to be well worth the price especially with the mail in coupon.  </li>
            <li> I was using a Sonicare for pretty much the last 10+ years.</li>
            <li> Both seem to equally make my teeth and mouth feel fresh.  </li>
            <li> The sonic set I was going to get was only 5 dollars more and came with an extra sensitive brush head....</li>
            <li> I find the single head easier to clean.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t keep it plugged in regularly, but it can easily hold full power for a few days.  </li>
            <li> The bristles are hard enough to feel like you got a good clean but soft enough that it doesn&#x27;t hurt your gums.  </li>
            <li> I paid twice as much for the OLD version than I did for the new version 1000 model.</li>
            <li> 30 sec timers are very useful.</li>
            <li> It did take about 24 hours to initially charge, which surprised me, but recharges quickly after each use.</li>
            <li> and I was thrilled to see it cost half the price and had the same amount of stars.  </li>
            <li> Sound is ringing, easy bleeding, brushing your teeth is worse than the philips a lot</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is easy to use, especially for someone like me who has a smaller jaw.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anybody want to buy a year and a half old Rotadent with a worn out brush head : )</li>
            <li> Easy to use, pauses when it&#x27;s time to change to the next quadrant, ensuring all areas get brushed !</li>
            <li> Other models in that line have additional bells and whistles that for most people are unnecessary and therefore not cost effective.  </li>
            <li> I liked the small footprint of the charger, plus a $20 rebate!</li>
            <li> My new one has a few new features to make it even better, like the timer notes every 30 seconds of the 2 minute time, by vibrating, to let you move to another area of teeth cleaning.  </li>
            <li> so you know you&#x27;ve brushed each quadrant of your teeth for the right amount of time.</li>
            <li> The charging stand is smaller but right for the brush.</li>
            <li> He also stated that I would look forward to brushing again later in the day, and he was certainly right about that.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> /&gt;Pretty simple right?</li>
            <li> The feature that notifies me every 30 seconds and every two minutes how long I&#x27;ve been brushing, by making the brush stutter, is a mild annoyance, and can&#x27;t be turned off.  </li>
            <li> The brush heads wear out a bit quickly, but I also tend to be a long brusher, so I wouldn&#x27;t attribute it to the product.</li>
            <li> New Precision Clean brush heads are a bit larger &amp; really are tailored to the size of the individual tooth.</li>
            <li> Since the design elements on the budget versions are similar to the pro versions and uses the same toothbrush head, I thought the budget Oral B electric toothbrush was just as good as the more expensive Oral-B Pros.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was not at all sure I would want the 30 second brief pause that encourages the user to move on to the next area, but I have found it very helpful and quite unobtrusive in completing an even 2 minutes.  </li>
            <li> My gums look great, my teeth always feel like I just came from the dentist, it stops when you brush too hard, and it gets in every single place!</li>
            <li> you get multiple brush modes (daily clean, sensitive, polish, deep clean), pressure sensors, and even wireless displays.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I like Oral B, and this is a fine model to get, but I found soon after getting it that local retailers had it for the same price or cheaper, and I could also find coupons with some regularity.</li>
            <li> My teeth have never felt so smooth with any other brush.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not as comfortable as other brushes i have used.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t even consider any other product, your teeth are too important to gamble on a &amp;#34;maybe&amp;#34; product.</li>
            <li> Since I didn&#x27;t find the digital info useful and always used the normal mode which was never a problem for my sensitive teeth, I decided to \\&quot;downgrade\\&quot; to the no frills Oral B 1000 model featuring one speed and no display.</li>
            <li> Feels good on the gums, not sure if it&#x27;s making anything better or worse.</li>
            <li> This new model I believe is faster than the older model it replaced, if you have never used a brush like this you may need to go a little easy on pressure to get used to it.</li>
            <li> Frankly, I did not think it would live up to the &amp;#34;hype&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve now used my new one</li>
            <li> so I decided a new one was in order.</li>
            <li> It feels like I have new teeth.  </li>
            <li> (The 1000 model number replaced the 7400 model number which replaced the 3D number, all without any claim of being a new model, but no doubt there have been some updates to it over the years.)    </li>
            <li> But this new model is simpler and just as effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> Because I threw away the box and the receipt thinking that there would be no problems with the brush since it was brand new, I have no way of returning it to the store.  </li>
            <li> After 5 years of use, I just replaced my toothbrush with a new Oral-B Pro 1000 model.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to electric toothbrushes</li>
            <li> I bought this toothbrush, new, out of the box.</li>
            <li> It was returned and a new brush was sent out immediately.</li>
            <li> I live in a multi-person house hold</li>
            <li> I have used the new electrical toothbrush for about a month now</li>
            <li> I was astonished with the speed/power of the new toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> so it had been years since I looked for a new toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Was looking for a new electric toothbrush to replace my 5 year Braun unit.  </li>
            <li> so she just bought a new one</li>
            <li> I started searching for a new one.</li>
            <li> With the new Oral-B, I have to recharge it twice a week, which, granted</li>
            <li> I still could easily live with manual brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> He loves the electric toothbrush, and wanted him to have spare brush heads for the new toothbrush.</li>
            <li> so I decided it was time for a new toothbrush.</li>
            <li> my new look....</li>
            <li> yeah, time for a new one.</li>
            <li> When I lucked out and saw a new one of these on eBay for $27.99/free ship (didn&#x27;t wanna hassle with the rebate), I decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li> The disadvantage is I don&#x27;t live in US</li>
            <li> wanted to have a new brush</li>
            <li> Almost cheaper to buy a new unit than to buy a pack of brush replacements</li>
            <li> had to buy a new one.</li>
            <li> The new ones (these)</li>
            <li> For new buyers....  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Finally decided to replace the thing when I saw the price on this new one (plus $15 off from a mfg rebate).</li>
            <li> A new version for $30?</li>
            <li> If this device could be upgraded with a new battery, a superior-quality build would make sense.</li>
            <li> Includes new features explained in the instruction booklet.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll update this review when I&#x27;ve had some experience with the new one.</li>
            <li> This new one is noisy.</li>
            <li> In fact, the Oral-B that I replaced with this new one wasn&#x27;t out of working order ....</li>
            <li> I thought I would replace it with a new one for Christmas.  </li>
            <li> this series instead of just buying new heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Sure, I could set a timer and keep an eye on it, switching to different parts of my mouth as the timer counts down, but this is very convenient.</li>
            <li> Sure, I could set a timer and keep an eye on it, switching to different parts of my mouth as the timer counts down, but this is very convenient.</li>
            <li> As a Prime member was let down with the performance of the product and really had hoped for better back up from Amazon.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a fan of electric toothbrushes, and the battery life on this new Precision 1000 is a few days longer than my old variant, so that&#x27;s ok with me.</li>
            <li> It is easy to handle and takes up less counter space.&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li> What you give up is more features, like UV sterilizing and perhaps additional cleaning modes (like a gentle cycle on your washing machine, some brushes have a mode for delicate users).  </li>
            <li> What you give up is more features, like UV sterilizing and perhaps additional cleaning modes (like a gentle cycle on your washing machine, some brushes have a mode for delicate users).  </li>
            <li> a note - the different heads available can be quite different.  </li>
            <li> just how much pressure is enough and when it is too much.</li>
            <li> really thought these electric tooth brush is really meant for the physically challenged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Am very satisfied and like that other brushes can be interchanged in the unit for other family members.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t understand why anyone would pay 2/3/4 times as much for the same thing from oral-b with additional features.</li>
            <li> A marked improvement over the older Oral-B toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> We bought these to replace older rechargeable tooth brushes and WOW.  </li>
            <li> has a red light to indicate low battery&lt;br</li>
            <li> Decent build quality so far.  </li>
            <li> model seems to have good battery life, at least initially.  </li>
            <li> It does the job and in a nice way without shaking your fillings loose like some other electric toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li> Also I have a fairly large mouth with fairly large teeth, and the tiny heads on this thing made it feel like I was brushing with a bundle of soft toothpicks.</li>
            <li> She got the exact same rejection letter (after sending away the original UPC in a carefully sealed envelope.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Many people prefer the battery operated ones due to the cheaper price, but when you add up the cost of batteries you&#x27;re really losing money in the long run.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush works well; cleans fast and deep, is easy to use and maintain.&lt;br /&gt;The Oral-B Professional \\&quot;Precision 1000\\&quot; is lightweight but powerful.&lt;br /&gt;Being completely waterproof and induction-charged suggests a long product life.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also very loud.</li>
            <li> the unit is very light and the pottery is very heavy.  </li>
            <li> The 1st we received was not working properly and Amazon sent another one with very fast delivery.</li>
            <li> I did not take it on a recent vacation with me and regretted it, very very much.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend the Oral-B Professional Care 1000 Electric Toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend the Oral-B Professional Care 1000 Electric Toothbrush.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very loud, but I hear that that&#x27;s the norm for electric toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> I have a very small mouth, as my dentist will attest, and most of them are too large and my teeth do not get cleaned as well.</li>
            <li> There is only one speed, which is fine because I only used one speed on my old model.</li>
            <li> /&gt;While the brush handle itself is nice and quiet, the brushing heads that come with the brush are a little loud.</li>
            <li> The charge lasts long enough that you can travel with this brush easily.</li>
            <li> I like that it has a timer to tell you when to switch to other areas of your mouth, and having the brush stop if I push too hard it great too.  </li>
            <li> There are stutters to let you know how long you&#x27;ve been brushing, but they&#x27;re easy enough to ignore, and the unit doesn&#x27;t turn itself off.</li>
            <li> It lasts long, easy to maintain, doesn&#x27;t require extensive charging (though the charging does take forever).</li>
            <li> The charge lasts for a long time so short trips can easily be done without the charger.</li>
            <li> but, given that corporate environmental irresponsibility is ubiquitous and typical, I am glad I spent less and still have a good way to take care of the ol&#x27; pearly whites.nd</li>

            <li> Our second Oral B. First one lasted 6 years - with wife and I using it 2x a day</li>
            <li> Better grip, seems lighter, less likely to activate button by mistake like older model.&lt;br /&gt;3.  </li>
            <li> I replaced that first electric with another from the same brand.  </li>
            <li> Of the six models, I would say that the only ones that I did not like were the low-end Oral-B and the first Interplak.  </li>
            <li> The first lasted for about ten years.</li>
            <li> The first time i used it i felt like i was finally brushing my teeth.</li>
            <li> I lost my first on a recent trip.</li>
            <li> Been using it for a month and no problem so far!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of the modern electric toothbrush - and so is my dentist!  </li>
            <li> As the toothbrush pulsated after the first 30 seconds to indicate that it should be moved to a different part of the mouth, the brush immediately stopped working.  </li>
            <li> It seemed my first choice, did not vibrate enough.</li>
            <li> As an example, while I do use the normal brush speed, I prefer the sensitive heads because of my gums.  </li>
            <li> have gotten more cavities than I should in the past.  </li>
            <li> I received the replacement and was sent exactly the same thing.  </li>
            <li> I love that it has a small brush head.</li>
            <li> Completely unsanitary!</li>
            <li> Like I mentioned earlier, neither toothbrush is better than the other at cleaning your teeth</li>
            <li> I mentioned earlier, neither toothbrush is better than the other at cleaning your teeth, it&#x27;s just the Oral-b</li>
            <li> With the first use my teeth felt like I just left the dentist.</li>
            <li> After we recieved the replacement we snt the first back prepaid.</li>
            <li> I ordered it online for value as comparable brushes were selling for higher prices in local retail.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The more expensive ones have more bells and whistles, but I still believe they do the SAME job of cleaning the teeth.</li>
            <li> The only thing that you should be aware of is that although it comes with a charger, there is no place to hold the brush attachment.  </li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t that old!  </li>
            <li> I felt like I went from a classy compact car to a luxurious full-size premier sedan!</li>
            <li> and after using it for only a week, I really think I notice my teeth getting whiter!  </li>
            <li> and so far it works!  </li>
            <li> Even though this model is more towards the basic side of features compared to the other models, it&#x27;s all you need for brushing teeth.</li>
            <li> and I used it for the first time last night.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> my first visit back to the dentist after using this toothbrush</li>
            <li> Pretty gross.</li>
            <li> First, I&#x27;ve only had this for a week</li>
            <li> In terms of vibration and noise I find it very quiet, but as i said this is my first electric toothbrush</li>
            <li> The Sonicare head was pretty big</li>
            <li> I personally prefer the smaller, circular brush head of the 1000 to the more traditional linear type of head used by Sonicare.</li>
            <li> I had an old one of these for about 25 years!  </li>
            <li> Toothbrushes from oral B has given the market top notch products over the past years.</li>
            <li> It works just as well as my old brush and was 1/3 the price!</li>
            <li> Resulted in more stain than usual on my teeth.</li>
            <li> This is definitely better than manual brushes as well as the various other electric toothbrushes I have used.</li>
            <li> My first finally bit the dust after 13 years.</li>
            <li> This was a Christmas gift for our 20 year old son and he loves it!  </li>
            <li> Sought a relacement for my previous tooth brush, and this one is just fine.</li>
            <li> Whenever I scale after manual brushing I usually have a notable amount of plaque remaining .</li>
            <li> This is my first electric toothbrush and I can not believe the difference from regular brushing.  </li>
            <li> replacement for my original is a bit slimmer but same basic specs</li>
            <li> I completely disagree!</li>
            <li> Because of the way I use this toothbrush (not all the time) I have not had to replace the heads more than once in the past</li>
            <li> Try the flossing action one if you like the feeling of a jackhammer on your gums!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, this is much better than the inexpensive ones I&#x27;ve had in the past.</li>
            <li> I will tell you that my dentist had recommended a different brand and a higher model in that brand with lots of bells and whistles.</li>
            <li> I bought a higher price model last Christmas and wanted another one but at a cheaper price.  </li>
            <li> Although it didn&#x27;t take long to arrive it was worth the wait.</li>
            <li> The other thing I like is that the charger interface is exactly the same as it was on our original one from 15 years ago.  </li>
            <li> So a good buy as a one-person brush but not ideal for families or couples who share.</li>
            <li> But if more than one person uses it, that really cuts down the use time, and that&#x27;s where the overly long recharge period is an issue.</li>
            <li> As long as it is totally discharge every 6 months it should be fine.  </li>
            <li> The battery lasts a long time, and it does a pretty decent job at getting in between teeth</li>
            <li> I would recommend starting to use a toothbrush like this AFTER getting a thorough cleaning at the dentist, so you&#x27;re essentially starting off with a clean slate.</li>
            <li> My teeth feel just as clean as they did the day of my recent cleaning, whereas with a regular toothbrush I&#x27;d probably already be feeling some buildup.</li>
            <li> I credit this excellent result to moving the brush very slowly for about 2 minutes per quadrant, not the entire job, for a total of 8 minutes, twice daily.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy to report that it works exactly as I expected it to (the single brushing speed is the same as the speed I always used on my old brush) and uses the same replacement brushes.  </li>
            <li> so I know that I&#x27;ve done due diligence in getting my mouth clean.  </li>
            <li> I had other electrical tooth brushes before, but now I can feel the clean power on my teeths after each brush.</li>
            <li> I like that the charger takes up so little space on the bathroom counter, but re-charging time is kind of long.</li>
            <li> This Oral-B Professional Care 1000 Electric Rechargeable Power Toothbrush is  more expensive but definitely works better than my Colgate battery-powered toothbrush.</li>
            <li> since I still have the old Oral-B I use that one while the new one is charging.</li>
            <li> Oral-B toothbrush with their new Professional Care 1000.</li>
            <li> My old Oral-B doesn&#x27;t hold a candle to this new</li>
            <li> Both the old and the new products are made in Germany, which explains why the old one still works as well as it did when it was new.  </li>
            <li> My 20 year old unit broke, my fault, so I bought a new one.</li>
            <li> The new unit is an improvement over the old, as the manufacturer has upgraded and improved it over the years.</li>
            <li> I had to buy this new version because the charger of the old one was damaged and Braun has discontinued that version.</li>
            <li> Since companies can&#x27;t come up with any new ideas, they start to try and complicate old ones to make them seem new.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I just repurchased a new Sonicare with some sensitive head replacements</li>
            <li> The new toothbrush is lighter, cleaner looking and operates just as well as the old.  </li>
            <li> The new one arrived quickly, thank you Amazon Prime, But, after 24 hours it would only run about 15 seconds, I left it on the charger another 24 hours, again 10 or 15 seconds.</li>
            <li> And they&#x27;re quite cheap these days; the [[ASIN:B0002M5JNY Oral-B S-200]] costs significantly less than this one.</li>
            <li> Compact, light with a long lasting battery.</li>
            <li> contents of the box are few and this product is easy to use.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, slim to hold, waterproof to be placed in the bathroom; and it pauses automatically when I press it heavily upon a tooth</li>
            <li> The brush heed snaps on easily &amp; remains firm while brushing.</li>
            <li> As expected is as good if not better than the one purchased 10 years ago.</li>
            <li> - you get plenty of brushing action and &#x27;more&#x27; is not necessarily better.  </li>
            <li> Overall, this is much better than regular toothbrushes, with a really unobtrusive charger, so I won&#x27;t ever be going back to regular brushes.</li>
            <li> This definitely does a great job of cleaning but the biggest setback is the base grows mold fairly quickly and gets pretty gross.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not bad overall, but I would spend some extra $ and get the 5000 model.  </li>
            <li> just like any other brush nothing special.</li>
            <li> The major drawback is that there is a blinking green light that lights a darkened bathroom very well for about 15 minutes after using the machine and placing it on the charger.  </li>
            <li> most things, it comes down to personal tastes, but I found my [[ASIN:B0019ZGU1S</li>
            <li> They seemed to get down into the gumline better than the traditional shaped heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;The very narrow head makes brushing much easier and comfortable to use.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I was surprised by how loud it is!</li>
            <li> - I just had my first dental cleaning after using the Oral B Professional 1000 with the Floss Action brush head for the last four months.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyhow, a few novacaine injections, a wisdom tooth extraction, and a couple hundred bucks later, good folks at the Tooth Spa sent me home drooling like a disoriented monkey and with explicit instructions to purchase one of this gizmos.</li>
            <li> review--&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used a manual toothbrush for at least the past 10 years, but was looking for a cheap and effective electric one, since I always read about the benefits of them.</li>
            <li> I bought a new Oral B \\&quot;Professional Care 1000\\&quot; electric toothbrush and threw away my old electric toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> I brush well anyway, and floss twice daily, but this thing brings tooth brushing to a whole new level.</li>
            <li> It uses the same model of brush head but this model cleans more aggressively than the previous one.  </li>
            <li> I actually spend less time brushing now and get better results.  </li>
            <li> Cleans better and faster than a regular toothbrush with less effort.</li>
            <li> Luckily, it fits the same charger and the same replacement heads!</li>
            <li> This brush made my entire head vibrate like a jack hammer, was very loud, and gave me VERY SORE gums after just one use.</li>
            <li> My previous models had a backing so at least it felt more secure.</li>
            <li> Expected the same smooth action from a new brush</li>
            <li> The only drawback I have heard of is the size of the brush head not being as large as some</li>
            <li> Have had it only a few weeks but works great and half the price of my old one which was just like this one.  </li>
            <li> It occurred to me that if my dentists have always used small round rotating brushes (vs. any other motion), then that must be what&#x27;s best</li>
            <li> The recharge light is a little obtrusive in that it blinks instead of just a stead glow.  </li>
            <li> powerful cleaning, and a battery that lasts for days on a single charge!</li>
            <li> The older one was getting dirty and too slow but this one is very strong and easy to keep clean.</li>
            <li> Brush is okay, but the head it comes with needs to be a little bigger.</li>
            <li> I love how clean it leaves my mouth feeling: if I go away and have to use an ordinary toothbrush for even a few days I find myself delighting in the dental-cleaning-clean feeling I get when I come home to my trusty electric.</li>
            <li> I only have had the electric toothbrushes that you buy from your regular pharmacy type store but this is on a much higher caliber!</li>
            <li> Will shop a little more thoroughly next time.</li>
            <li> I suppose I will use it for a while but will eventually shell out a little more and get the next version up.</li>
            <li> Will do a little more research next time.</li>
            <li> It seems to rattle a little more than my last Oral-B&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and I love that there is a &#x27;warning signal&#x27; if I am pushing too hard, which can hurt your gums.</li>
            <li> It works ok, but the on-off button is hard to locate when you&#x27;re brushing.  </li>
            <li> in all, it would be hard to find a better electric toothbrush at anywhere close to this price.</li>
            <li> It also probably does a better job without brushing too hard.  </li>
            <li> I have owned several of these over time model has changed and gotten better, you certainly dont need anything mero complex than this.</li>
            <li> it works well, and I don&#x27;t find it to be super loud the way some other people mentioned.</li>
            <li> The Oral-b&#x27;s head is specifically designed to be round and small allowing users to clean each individual tooth while the structural design allow for simple and easy clean up.</li>
            <li> Neither will shaking the brush head vigorously clear all of it.</li>
            <li> The old one had simply worn out, he used it so much.</li>
            <li> : To clarify, there isn&#x27;t much point in reviewing the heads themselves because Oral-B offers several varieties.</li>
            <li> My 10 year old Oral-B started making a harsh sound when brushing.  </li>
            <li> my opinion, based on my experience, you should be pleasantly surprised if any of these electric brushes (of at least the 1000 and 3000 models) lasts more than a year.  </li>
            <li> In my opinion, based on my experience, you should be pleasantly surprised if any of these electric brushes (of at least the 1000 and 3000 models) lasts more than a year.  </li>
            <li> Steer clear.</li>
            <li> The image of the product clearly has a toothbrush head storage compartment attached to the charging unit.  </li>
            <li> So much less pressure on my gums, and my teeth still feel clean.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s half the price and way easier to clean.</li>
            <li> What I like about this type of loud is that it&#x27;s a low-pitched hum - like a really quiet biplane (haha,</li>
            <li> how unbelievably LOUD it is.</li>
            <li> It may not have all the bells and whistles, but it has (as far as I can tell anyway) all the performance.</li>
            <li> One feature this has that my old one didn&#x27;t is that when it is close to being in need of charge</li>
            <li> I replaced my old Oral B Vitality toothbrush with this</li>
            <li> It was old and getting louder and louder</li>
            <li> So far I haven&#x27;t even taken this one out of the box.</li>
            <li> Depending on your daily use, it can go about a week with the low battery red light comes on.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Well, I am just about to return the Oral B professional care</li>
            <li> This replaced a 10-year old Braun/Oral-B electric toothbrush.  </li>

            <li> Oral-b professional care 1000 also helps improve gum health by helping to prevent and reverse gingivitis (according to Oral B).</li>
            <li> and also had 2 additional modes of sensitive and polish.</li>
            <li> The Oral-B 1000 is the entry level of the Professional Care</li>
            <li> /&gt;Do note that the Professional Care 1000&#x27;s specifications indicate the presence of a pressure sensor.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive gums and did not find this brush head to be too abrasive.</li>

            <li> Replaced an old (10+ years)</li>
            <li> What an improvement over the old one.  </li>
            <li> At first, I took advantage of the feature of the 1000 model that lets you know how long you&#x27;re supposed to brush each quadrant of your mouth.</li>
            <li> and I decided to try Oral B Sonic Action after Oral B Professional 1000,&lt;br /&gt;because</li>
            <li> Definitely recommend the product to all who so ever wants to buy a Electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I replaced my Sonicare electric toothbrush with this one because I wanted one with replacement heads with soft bristles.  </li>
            <li> The charging light is green and flashes when being charged.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worked well so far, got compliments from my dentist.</li>

            <li> I like the old Oral-b that would pulse to let you know that the two minutes were up.  </li>
            <li> The 30 second timer for each part of your mouth is very helpful.</li>

            <li> I had an oral b professional 3000 or 5000.  </li>
            <li> I was upset that they stopped making replacement brushes for my old one just three years into ownership.  </li>
            <li> I have always had a Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush and when my old one needed replacing</li>
            <li> Seems to work well so far.  </li>
            <li> Also fits on the old charger which has a 4 brush storage.</li>
            <li> but it is twice as often as with my old elec.</li>
            <li> From full charge I usually get about 5 days (twice daily) brushing, then red light will flash.  </li>
            <li> of my unexpected pleasures of the Oral-B 1000 Pro toothbrush is the built in timers.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m assuming it does something like clear the memory on the battery when you allow it to go completely dead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I personally feel the chemicals in pastes and rinses that say &#x27;tartar-control&#x27; really work,</li>
            <li> I personally feel the chemicals in pastes and rinses that say &#x27;tartar-control&#x27; really work,</li>
            <li> So far this electric toothbrush machine has been holding up well.</li>
            <li> ; loud.</li>
            <li> Feels almost like the professional cleaning at the dentist, without the bill.</li>
            <li> Really like the 30 second timer.</li>
            <li> The smallish brush makes cleaning the far teeth easier.</li>
            <li> SO FAR SO GO  OD</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t think this brush works nearly as well as the oral b brush I had been using.</li>
            <li> thing I am not a fan of is how loud it is, I have never used an electric toothbrush</li>
            <li> so they all be this loud</li>
            <li> Bought this to replace an old one.  </li>
            <li> I actually brush for a whole two minutes thanks to the 30 second reminder function (yes, as an adult I didn&#x27;t brush for 2 minutes).</li>
            <li> Makes your teeth feel like you just had a professional cleaning.</li>
            <li> but so far I would buy it again</li>
            <li> replacement for the old one</li>
            <li> /&gt;It also had a gum setting, sensitive area setting and polish settings.</li>
            <li> Far exceeds my old Phillips sonic brush.</li>
            <li> But having used the brush for about a week now, I like knowing when my quarter-mouth 30-sec period is complete</li>
            <li> My old tooth brush broke</li>
            <li> My brother has had his for about 10 years so far.</li>
            <li> Let me begin with mentiong that i have sensitive gums.</li>
            <li> Using the oral b sensitive heads.</li>
            <li> So wow, what a difference when I got this one.  </li>
            <li> But I was surprised as the design of this head feels like it cups each tooth while doing its job</li>
            <li> I use it twice a day, it cleans the enamel off the plaque which generally takes a lot of effort while using a normal toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I like the timer which the my old one also had</li>
            <li> I picked this model because I wanted to try the Floss Action head, and it was a step up from Vitality which moves at about 1/4 of the speed of this one.</li>
            <li> It comes with 1 Precision head, but there was a $3 coupon enclosed, and the Floss Action heads were on sale at Walgreen&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> So I end up having to hit those manually with my old Cybersonic head.</li>
            <li> So I end up having to hit those manually with my old Cybersonic head.</li>
            <li> I got this for my 10 year old.  </li>
            <li> wow..</li>
            <li> Had a sonicare and did not like the brushing action or the cleaning involved with the toothbrush.</li>
            <li> The motor is not too loud and they&#x27;ve improved the timing mechanism so that it tells you every 30 seconds when to start brushing another area.  </li>
            <li> This unit has a rougher vibration and, in my opinion, is too fast for proper cleaning.</li>
            <li> I bought the sensitive gums head</li>
            <li> The vibrating and pulsing action massages the gums, and ensures that the bristles get in between your teeth, working to remove plaque buildup.</li>
            <li> This was a replacement for a 10 year old Oral-B.</li>
            <li> The directions say you can leave it plugged in, but that&#x27;s what I did with my old Sonicare and the battery</li>
            <li> After using the electric toothbrush for several months, I find that I really like it</li>
            <li> this replaced an oral-b nine years old</li>
            <li> I feel like my teeth are much cleaner than they were with a regular toothbrush</li>
            <li> my old one quite on me&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
            <li> gave me the needed cleanse and care that my sensitive teeth deserves.</li>
            <li> My old Oral-B toothbrush died after 7 years, so I decided to go with this one.  </li>
            <li> Has a lot of power, might switch to the sensitive heads as I have sensitive gums</li>
            <li> It is not the complete Oral B package that one purchases</li>
            <li> Her old one (Sonicare) died, and we decided to try an Oral-B.  </li>
            <li> All that is really needed is the final &#x27;reminder&#x27; pause at the end of 2 minutes.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as loud as the one I tossed in the garbage, and it feels like it&#x27;s cleaning my teeth.</li>
            <li> When our old Oral-B toothbrush wore out after 10+ years, my husband and I realized Oral-B was the brand for us.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After I had my buckles fixed my gums</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my husband and so far he says he loves it.</li>
            <li> I nearly always have to take it out while it&#x27;s still running to locate the button.</li>
            <li> This brush is about 50% quieter than the old one, and spins faster.</li>
            <li> Item was shipped fast and takes brushing to the next level.</li>
            <li> I just replaced an old Oral B toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> One thing I don&#x27;t like is the brush got soft too soon, 1 week, and it doesn&#x27;t have the two speeds as advertised.  </li>
            <li> I really like the 30 second intervals.  </li>
            <li> Needs to be cleaned nearly every day.</li>
            <li> It has a very indiscreet &amp;#34;skip&amp;#34; in the vibration every 30 seconds, with a &amp;#34;double skip&amp;#34; at two minutes to help you ensure a proper brushing time.  </li>
            <li> (I like the old charger because it has a brush-head holder attached).</li>
            <li> Had to replace my old, worn out Oral-B toothbrush</li>
            <li> I really like the 30 second timer for each quadrant</li>
            <li> Works well and direct replacement for another one I had that is now having battery issues.</li>
            <li> My teeth &amp;#34;almost&amp;#34; felt young again.</li>
            <li> (I bought the soft heads, bc</li>
            <li> My oral surgeon recommended using the Oral B Professional electronic toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> This unit has improvements and additional features from the old one.</li>
            <li> Feels like you havejust had your teeth cleansed professionally.  </li>
            <li> Oral B Professional Care 1000 Electric Toothbrush.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It reaches places I could not reach with my old tooth brush.</li>
            <li> They said these were loud and vibrated a lot</li>
            <li> We really didn&#x27;t use the fancy display on all of the others we&#x27;ve had and found this one works the same as the fancy versions.</li>
            <li> old son needed his toothbrush replace, we decided to get him an Oral B, too.  </li>
            <li> I bought this brush after my old Oral-B went to Tooth Fairy heaven.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;I got a professional electric toothbrush,\\</li>
            <li> I think the old models were dual voltage.</li>
            <li> My son is sensitive to vibration and he tolerates and loves this brush.</li>
            <li> The reason for purchasing this toothbrush is that dentist recommend a circular brush action which my old brush did not have.  </li>
            <li> this was a replacement product as my old one died.</li>
            <li> She loves it so much that I have to limit her to only using it twice a day!!</li>
            <li> It gets my teeth cleaner than the old model did.</li>
            <li> I really like that after 30 seconds it has a different vibration</li>
            <li> It so far is working well, as I was hoping.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had an old oral b toothbrush.</li>
            <li> This is a replacement for  a 7 year old model.  </li>
            <li> WOW People treat yourself to an electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I have the Sonicare and didn&#x27;t like how gunk would go into the brush head requiring considerable cleaning weekly.  </li>
            <li> I like the brushing action.</li>
            <li> old one lasted forever.</li>
            <li> Keeps my teeth much cleaner than standard brushing</li>
            <li> so I had to order the Sensitive toothbrush replacements.  </li>
            <li> Now I have to switch out the brushes for sensitive areas and tougher areas like my built in retainer and tongue.  </li>
            <li> Toothbrush is well built and not too loud.</li>
            <li> I have a sonic toothbrush that I really like, but a year ago I found that I needed a second toothbrush to keep at the office and throw in my case for those away from home trips.  </li>
            <li> Needed a replacement as our 25+ yr old Oral-B died.</li>
            <li> I use it with the soft head refills.</li>
            <li> Works well, reasonably priced, does not come with case or extra brush heads or anything to store brush</li>
            <li> THE OLD FASHION WAY OF BRUSHING TEETH</li>
            <li> I will see how it really does at my next checkup.with the dentist.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had any problems so far.</li>
            <li> i needed to replace my old &amp;#34;Vitality&amp;#34; model (had it for 8 years)</li>
            <li> This was bought as an update for an old Oral-B toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> When I saw there was a professional model that was affordable</li>
            <li> I would recommend the the Oral B Professional to anyone who likes electrib brushes.  </li>
            <li> My teeth feel so much cleaner after brushing, though I don&#x27;t know if they actually are.</li>
            <li> In terms of charging it, it will take about 24 hours for the green light to stop flashing.</li>
            <li> noticeable difference vs old toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I thought it might come with a sensitive speed, too, but not in this model.</li>
            <li> can only speculate that the slime is generated by the moisture trapped in the many parts within the brush</li>
            <li> The charger is really small and tucks away nicely and the toothbrush holds a really long charge.</li>
            <li> , so I guess I shouldn&#x27;t have expected it to be as powerful.</li>
            <li> I bought the 5000 model for myself and while the 5000 model has a few more features including the display unit ( which never worked properly for me</li>
            <li> While I&#x27;ve only been using it for a few weeks, my family and I LOVE this thing.  </li>
            <li> and that is just scary-as in scary good</li>
            <li> and that is just scary-as in scary good performance.    </li>
            <li> The instructions say that you can leave the toothbrush off the charger for up to a week, but I&#x27;ve noticed the motor runs more slowly if I leave it off the charger for even a day.</li>
            <li> Double A battery ones slowly die and becomeless effective.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I will say that I loved the UV base on my older toothbrush, but replacement brushes were nowhere near as easy to come by whereas with this one I can find them in just about any pharmacy, supermarket or big box chain</li>
            <li> Works good but replacement heads so expensive.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace an electric toothbrush I had for many years that was slowly dying.  </li>
            <li> but it had an LED screen in the handle which was kind of unnecessary, caused it to be bulky, and I think it also ate up power.&lt;br</li>
            <li> this brush is a strong little machine!</li>
            <li> Then I just keep using for few more days to totally run battery down before charging full.</li>
            <li> This answers my desire for a toothbrush that is easy to use,takes little room on my counter-top and is easily rinsed, towel dried and replaced in short order...</li>
            <li> It lacks the different modes and it is less powerful than the higher models.</li>
            <li> This machine runs at a higher speed than the previous model, which attribute I don&#x27;t really understand.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s footprint is tiny - about a square inch, and the cord is super long.</li>
            <li> In my opinion this is the better of the two Oral-B and the other more expensive Sonicare.</li>
            <li> the voltage is not fit for my country ，but the other side is good enough for me</li>
            <li> Also, the neck of the brush is bigger than others and I find toothpaste easily runs down the brush when brushing</li>
            <li> The handle part is slimmer than in the past and is easy to move around the mouth.</li>
            <li> I started using the first one on a consistent basis  for the last few months--ie-- brushing for exactly 2 minutes (30 seconds per quadrant) using the stutter reminder and guess what, my dental checkup came back flying colors, almost no plague.  </li>
            <li> It is fast and does the job much quicker than the other one I have.  </li>
            <li> Simple, straightforward, single-speed device; works just as expected.</li>
            <li> The charger is small and easy to use.</li>
            <li> and I was due for a new one as the old one didn&#x27;t seem to be holding charge very well anymore!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Every thirty seconds, a timer in the brush causes the brush to &#x60;stutter&#x27; in several pulses that tells you to go on to the next section of your teeth and gums, if you&#x27;re interrupted, you can turn the brush off and it will continue the cleaning program from where it left off so long as it isn&#x27;t turned off for more than thirty seconds at a time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Every thirty seconds, a timer in the brush causes the brush to &#x60;stutter&#x27; in several pulses that tells you to go on to the next section of your teeth and gums, if you&#x27;re interrupted, you can turn the brush off and it will continue the cleaning program from where it left off so long as it isn&#x27;t turned off for more than thirty seconds at a time.    </li>
            <li> These brushes along with the motor clean teeth so well, that my dentist is always amazed by how little plaque I have.</li>
            <li> It also vibrates very quickly and you only need to plug the charger in when you are recharging - not all the time as I did with my previous one.  </li>
            <li> Very easy to use, long lasting on a single charge, Oral B Pro does a terrific job!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The only time I ever used the low speed on the Sonic Complete was when I first started using it</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the smaller base size which frees up more cabinet space.</li>
            <li> I have only used this a short time but so far this unit is much better than my previous Oral B 1000.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend buying the extra soft bristles, before I got this electric toothbrush</li>
            <li> I especially like the feature where it has a special pulse every 30 sec</li>
            <li> I already have this particular product, so ordered this one for a Christmas present from Amazon.  </li>
            <li> I finally decided I didn&#x27;t want to add the higher end complexity to my oral hygene or pay the extra money.  </li>
            <li> I used an older model and upgraded to the current model.  </li>
            <li> Had to replace and older Oral-B electric toothbrush that finally died and</li>
            <li> It also seems to get my teeth cleaner than an older earlier version Oral-B that I needed to replace.  </li>
            <li> The only thing that i don&#x27;t like is that the brush head is small and i need to reapply toothpaste between doing the top set and bottom.</li>
            <li> I corrected it by putting a small piece of aluminum foil over the light and it blocks it completely and the foil is &amp;#34;water-proof&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> Replacement for similar older model.  </li>
            <li> If it last as long well worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;Does</li>
            <li> , my hygienist asked if i had been doing things differently because my teeth and gums looked better than usual.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the older model of this same toothbrush for years</li>
            <li> This is my first electric tooth brush and likely not my last.</li>
            <li> Overall decent product.</li>
            <li> Small size gets in to more spaces than larger sized brushes.</li>
            <li> I like the 30 second interval signals which encourage me to be consistent in brushing the different sections of my teeth.  </li>
            <li> The first one was one of the more expensive models.</li>
            <li> definitely don&#x27;t need the extra features offered in the higher end versions.</li>
            <li> Bought this to replace an older model that finally bit the dust.  </li>
            <li> I bought this to replace an older version of the same brand and price point.  </li>
            <li> same EXACT story has happened to a friend of mine who recently purchased this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> every thirty seconds, which I find useful because I often didn&#x27;t spend long enough before.</li>
            <li> I definitely noticed that the rotating brush was an improvement on my older Oral-B</li>
            <li> I am a big fan of oral-b toothbrushes, but everyone should be aware that the chargers are quite likely to quit working within a year.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have a timer like I was hoping for but it gets the job done other wise and its very small</li>
            <li> Compared to the Philips brand that my wife had before, this one takes a little bit longer to charge the battery and the brushing power is not as strong and no option for different settings.  </li>
            <li> If the old one is any indicator of the new one&#x27;s durability, then I should be using my new one for a LONG time.  </li>
            <li> I have never felt such a clean other than getting my 6 month check up at my dentist.</li>
            <li> The other reviewer was right: this thing is like a jack-hammer.</li>
            <li> Even after purchasing the SonicSeal, which I highly suggest to anyone who has the Elite/Essence model, mold would still build up at the bottom of the SonicSeal/Sonicare handle without proper cleaning.</li>
            <li> one.&lt;br /&gt;It operates on a very high speed and also holds its&#x27; charge for a long time too.</li>
            <li> However not much later, Oral-B came out with their first \\&quot;SmartSeries\\&quot; which has a special sensor that monitors if the user is pressing too hard on the teeth--this is indicated by reading the signals on an LCD display.</li>
            <li> I needed a new rechargeable toothbrush since my old oral B finally died.</li>
            <li> My old one died after several yrs and needed a new one.</li>
            <li> heads are available from both the company and generic (so hidden cost of the heads can be reduced if you shop</li>
            <li> great product, i bought some for my family members, compare to the expensive pro 5000 or pro 7000, it has the same effect, the only daily clean mode can satisfy one&#x27;s normal use already, i have pro 5000 also, but i only use the daily clean mode everyday, so if i can make the decision again, i will buy this pro 1000 for myself directly, i will not pay extra money for the different modes that i do not need.</li>
            <li> I like that it pulsates every 30 seconds and a special pattern at 2 minutes to let you know when you&#x27;ve brushed long enough.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very careful to dry the entire toothbrush every time I use it, but within a couple of days, a brown burnt gunk starts forming on the charger surface (the part that the toothbrush sits on) and every day there&#x27;s more until I scrape it off and start over again.</li>
            <li> very well--charging takes a bit long but plug it in overnight</li>
            <li> I hope this toothbrush lasts as many years as the one it replaced, which was at least ten years old.</li>
            <li> so you know how long to brush each quarter section of your teeth, very helpful.</li>
            <li> i wish i had bought one a long time ago thanks for agreat product</li>
            <li> Charges fast and lasts a long time&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> long before the charge starts dropping off fast.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m finding it to be just as capable as their far more expensive 5000 series.</li>
            <li> I really like that the battery stays charged for so long.</li>
            <li> It takes a long time to charge, but otherwise it seems to work real well.</li>
            <li> My teeth feel much cleaner after using this, and the charge lasts for a long time before I have to recharge.</li>
            <li> Properly used, these toothbrushes clean your teeth in all the hard to reach places (smaller brush head), and when gently held at a 45 degree angle near the base of the tooth, are excellent for removing the tartar that collects near the gum.  </li>
            <li> it is definitely easier on the arm than normal brushing, although I am somewhat anal when it comes to brushing...</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t go back to a normal toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> I have no negative comments, works well and quietly with vibrating alerts for every 30 seconds of brush time.</li>
            <li> So far this toothbrush has yet to fail them and they all love it!</li>
            <li> Note that the cheapest model that can use a 3D brush head works just as well as the most expensive model, which just has a few more bells and whistles on the timer and display.</li>
            <li> In contrast to other rechargeable electric toothbrushes, the Oral-B has a smaller, round head which more readily allows it to access ALL areas of my teeth.  </li>
            <li> a little sluggish if you press to hard but does a good job if you take your time</li>
            <li> /&gt;Packaging is also  typical for Amazon - First Rate!</li>
            <li> When my old Oral-B electric toothbrush died, I had to order a new one ASAP because brushing with a regular toothbrush left my teeth feeling less than clean.  </li>
            <li> I think electric wins hands down.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth the investment, hands down.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There&#x27;s a big difference in thinking you&#x27;ve done the proper amount of brushing time and ACTUALLY doing the right amount of brushing time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> One speed and stops when you push hard so this brush is definitely easy to use.  </li>
            <li> I found that simply hitting the &#x27;on&#x27; button as many times as I could as I went by, I was able to get it down to truly dead, but it generally requires using the bush manually for a day or so, until it is completely dead</li>

            <li> I have to clean the brush regularly because excess toothpaste foam drips down the brush and hardens, but I imagine that&#x27;s an issue with any electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> You can spend more to get less from other products.  </li>
            <li> When I had to use a regular toothbrush, I couldn&#x27;t wait until my new one arrived.  </li>
            <li> I had an oral B several years ago till it wore out; then bought a Phillips Sonicare at the recommendation of my new dentist.</li>
            <li> Had to buy a new one because my last one died after 6 years of continued use.  </li>
            <li> I have been using the same one for 10 years, never needed to buy a new one.  </li>
            <li> the earlier model was when it was new.  </li>
            <li> I bought this new brush because I had a surplus of toothbrush heads for a similar model that broke after 5 years of use.</li>
            <li> So when my last one died I decided to, of course, buy a new one.</li>
            <li> After using the same electric toothbrush for almost 10 years (a Braun 3D), the batteries just couldn&#x27;t keep charged &amp; it was time for a new one.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve used Oral-B for years, accidentally left the charger in Florida so had to order two new ones.</li>
            <li> I always had to awkwardly position the brush to clean the inside of my teeth, the outer portion is really easy though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> She told me her Dental Hygienist commented that there was less plaque to clean off and asked if she was doing anything different.</li>
            <li> since it doesn&#x27;t seem to stop any action no matter how much pressure I exert on it, I worry it is too rough on my teeth.</li>
            <li> since it doesn&#x27;t seem to stop any action no matter how much pressure I exert on it, I worry it is too rough on my teeth.</li>
            <li> Hopefully, it was last as long as my first one.</li>
            <li> 1000.&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s enough vibrating to message and (with the soft brushes \\&quot;Oral-B Sensitive [</li>
            <li> It could be that I am just used to the strength and feel of Sonicare, but this brush is quite a bit less powerful.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Plaque gone, slight gum bleeding gone, dentist fresh vibe after each brushing,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It does need to be recharged after a few days of use (the red light flashes on the device), however, I do brush for a lengthy time each time I use it.  </li>
            <li> only wish I have is the charger (which is really compact) can be used internationally (</li>
            <li> This works pretty well, but not brushing long enough was never a problem for me.</li>
            <li> My old one is over 15 years old, and actually still works.  </li>
            <li> Only gripe is the blinking green light when charging, because the vanity area and outlet are inside my bedroom, so it lights up in the night.</li>
            <li> Only drawback is a 22-hour charge time from bottom to top, and a recommendation to fully discharge the battery at least every 6 months to preserve the rechargeable battery.  </li>
            <li> That protrusion totally prevents me from getting the bristles to the chewing area of my back teeth, which really pisses me off, because I like to be thorough.</li>
            <li> That protrusion totally prevents me from getting the bristles to the chewing area of my back teeth, which really pisses me off, because I like to be thorough.</li>
            <li> The footprint of the actual charging station is tiny, so it doesn&#x27;t take up too much room on my bathroom counter.  </li>
            <li> I unplug the charger when I&#x27;m not actively charging the brush.</li>
            <li> I looked online for a replacement, and decided to go for this earlier model because my husband has a newer and fancier model (with a timer, battery indicator, etc), but it doesn&#x27;t really feel very different.</li>
            <li> The only downside is that the rotation tends to stop a second if too much pressure is put on the brush.</li>
            <li> Noisy, difficult to make sure you are getting the whole tooth surface.  </li>
            <li> though I had more cons than pros, don&#x27;t get me wrong, I still really like this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Very basic, no timer, does not pulse, very load, and battery time is very short.  </li>
            <li> as good as the expensive if you dont need extra lights and bells literally.</li>
            <li> really don&#x27;t feel that I miss the features of the more expensive one.</li>
            <li> Battery lasts quite a while between charges, and I like the small roundness of the brush head, good for reaching small areas.  </li>
            <li> I tried the battery powered one a few years ago and tossed in quickly.  </li>
            <li> It would have been a wiser decision to charge a dollar or two more and provide a better charging base.  </li>
            <li> No need to buy a whole kit, this came as a single brush</li>
            <li> fast forward to every single dental visit since I switched to this Oral-B brush</li>
            <li> The brush is just right (a little stiff) and my mouth feels clean, once finished.</li>
            <li> but I promise to properly dispose of the old toothbrush!  </li>
            <li> Terrific product so far!</li>
            <li> No other toothbrush shape comes close.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I never knew why I couldn&#x27;t get all the white off my tongue with a regular toothbrush, this Oral-B removed all the white the first time!&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li> Like this toothbrush just fine except - the on/off button is hard to locate while you&#x27;ve got the toothbrush in your mouth.</li>
            <li> No other comparison</li>
            <li> This is my first electric toothbrush and after a few days I can tell that it will get my teeth much cleaner than a regular brush.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> This is the first electric toothbrush I have ever owned, so I cannot compare it to other products.  </li>
            <li> made me little dissy at first, no joke!</li>
            <li> I thought that it would have the feature to slow the brush down for a more gentle cleaning but this model doesn&#x27;t have it.</li>
            <li> I think it might be slightly too powerful, but I&#x27;d rather go a little over the top than not powerful</li>
            <li> Pros: small footprint, makes mouth feel clean.</li>
            <li> would recommend replacing the default toothbrush head provided (small circle) to the dual clean head.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like going to the dentist to get them clean everyday and that&#x27;s just fantastcic!</li>
            <li> a small head has a lot of power in it as well leaves mouth felling clean and refreshed.</li>
            <li> Wife has the 5000 and it cost a few times more, and we don&#x27;t care for the added features like bluetooth or use the other modes.</li>
            <li> The battery is now starting to need to be recharged noticeably more often now, so expect the life of one of these to last 3-4 years, which might not be as long as you expected it to last.</li>
            <li> It is very user friendly, and doesn&#x27;t have unnecessary add-ons.  </li>
            <li> She said that I needed it because I still have my wisdom teeth and a conventional tooth brush will not reach back far enough to adequately brush them.  </li>
            <li> Unlike the Vitality model it does not start slowing down before it dies completely, so if you travel regularly for more than a few days I recommend charging it completely before you leave.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Previous versions from other makers have been hard to keep clean, taken up more room and didn&#x27;t work quite as well.</li>
            <li> Never sure one better than the other, but like the action of this unit.  </li>
            <li> I only use it when I cannot clean some spots which are hard to reach using normal toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sleek and clean looking but it has a slow grind rather than the old one which had 2 speeds.</li>
            <li> the basic model with only 2 settings High and off</li>
            <li> Expected a little larger head, but love everything else about it.</li>
            <li> Definitely noticed a brighter smile in comparison to using conventional toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> I had a previous version of this brush from around 2003-2004, and it was still going strong...except the brush heads started to fit loosely</li>
            <li> Had a variety of OralB toothbrushes over the years and my general opinion is they are not what they used to</li>
            <li> It really doesn&#x27;t take much toothpaste at all for this small head.</li>
            <li> The head is smaller than my Spinbrush, this is important to me because I have a small mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I generally buy extra soft bristles for my manual toothbrushes</li>
            <li> When I finally got around to opening this product when my old Oral B sonic toothbrush died, I couldn&#x27;t believe:&lt;br /&gt;(1)</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not heavy enough to resist the force of the power cord pushing against it.  </li>
            <li> simply because it has a battery indicator and the word Professional in its name.</li>
            <li> only misgivings so far apart from cost</li>
            <li> It seems to still have a lot of power left when that starts happening, enough I&#x27;ve found to go for a couple more days at least.  </li>
            <li> My old one finally bit the dust after about 7 years of use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like getting a professional cleaning daily.</li>
            <li> decided to go back to the brushing (twirling clock, counter clock) of the Professional</li>
            <li> far as the brush goes it suppoed to occulate and vibrate it only occulates</li>
            <li> The power action is constantly pushing the toothpaste/saliva out of my mouth</li>
            <li> The Professional Care 1000 is very similar to the 3D Excel.  </li>
            <li> I was surprised that it actually made my teeth noticeably whiter after about 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> and we really wanted that feature and expected it to store all of our brush heads.</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;d say it does an equivalent job to prior.  </li>
            <li> I sent this back, postage was $Aud30.00, and asked for a replacement and stating that I needed a 220 volt Oral B Professional Care 1000 Electric rechargeable power toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> My old oral B finally quit working</li>
            <li> Would definitely recommend the Oral-B Professional.</li>
            <li> I bought this brush to replace a similar Professional Care model that lasted over 7 years of twice a day use.  </li>
            <li> so far I&#x27;ve only used the precision head which I do like...</li>
            <li> I ordered some extra brushes and my 5 yr old loves to use &#x27;daddy&#x27;s tooth brush now.</li>
            <li> My 5 year old model finally gave up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The Oral-B Professional Care 1000 toothbrushes that are sold in North America will have the 8,800 oscillations per minute but only 20,000 pulsations per minute&#x27;.</li>
            <li> My last Braun was 10 years old</li>
            <li> Going in with your expectations set low will most likely save you some of the frustration we&#x27;ve had with our several these past couple months.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Going in with your expectations set low will most likely save you some of the frustration we&#x27;ve had with our several these past couple months.  </li>
            <li> Purchased this brush to replace our old electric toothbrush, that after 4 years finally went up.</li>
            <li> My old Oral-B finally died.</li>
            <li> My old battery operated toothbrush finally quit on me.</li>
            <li> , I followed the instructions in the package of my last rechargeable to allow the battery to completely drain every three months or so.  </li>
            <li> ; loud, but definitely &amp;#34;hey guys, guess who&#x27;s brushing their teeth in the bathroom!&amp;#34</li>
            <li> my dentist was always telling me to brush softer with extra soft bristles.</li>
            <li> I also bought a 3-pack of the floss action brush heads for future use.</li>
            <li> So far, I&#x27;ve used the included standard brush head with my 1000 brush for about a week.</li>
            <li> Smaller brush makes getting back side of back teeth much easier.</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve gotten this toothbrush for 3 different people as gifts.</li>
            <li> I have to hold the handle upside-down and almost completely vertical, and hit those from above.</li>
            <li> I have to hold the handle upside-down and almost completely vertical, and hit those from above.</li>
            <li> I can still remember the epic difference between my regular toothbrush and this.</li>
            <li> My dentist had recommended I get an electric toothbrush since my brushing skills apparently suck.</li>
            <li> My dentist always comments how I barely have any plaque since using this product.  </li>
            <li> Definitely an upgrade from the old toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> You should go back to honoring price drops since it pisses off customers like me who frequently makes purchases on Amazon.</li>
            <li> It has 3 brush settings apparently</li>
            <li> The only caveat with this Oral-B is that you need to be conscious of using on each tooth.  </li>
            <li> are soft enough to make me think they&#x27;re cleaning under the gumline and not damaging my enamel.  </li>
            <li> Ordered this to replace my old Oral-B that was finally failing after 8 years!</li>
            <li> My old brush only signaled after 2minutes were up.</li>
            <li> I love the feature that tells me when I have brushed long enough on each quadrant and also tells you when you have brushed long enough overall.</li>
            <li> The cleaning action is a combination of a rotating brush that vibrates at the same time.  </li>
            <li> It does have the 30 second alert, which I did like in my old one.</li>
            <li> 220V charging can be directly used in China, it can not converter, personally tested.</li>
            <li> and I have no regrets.</li>
            <li> The only weakness that I&#x27;ve noted thus far is the lack of a brush head cover.</li>
            <li> I owned the Oral B Professional Care 5000 series for years and it finally died...</li>
            <li> We tried a cheaper generic store version of brush heads but were so unimpressed that we ordered the oral b floss action heads within a week.  </li>
            <li> I bought this item when my old one -- also Oral-B -- finally died.  </li>
            <li> Every several months you should completely discharge the battery then recharge it according to the instructions.</li>
            <li> This is the 2nd oral b professional toothbrush I have had</li>
            <li> But the biggest problem is the bristles are barely longer than the length of the head of the toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> i&#x27;m going to try the different head for it for sensitive gums but that could just be me.</li>
            <li> Every time I use it, I feel like I&#x27;ve just had a proper cleaning from the dentist, and don&#x27;t think I ever want to go back to using a normal toothbrush.</li>
            <li> This is a great toothbrush, though the timer can be a bit annoying if you&#x27;re a person who normally brushes their teeth longer than 2 minutes, though it doesn&#x27;t interfere with brushing.</li>
            <li> better way to stand behind your product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love the product, not happy with the rebate.</li>
            <li> The smaller head is especially useful for brushing behind the back teeth even if you still have your wisdom teeth in place, as I do.</li>
            <li> The battery life is ok, not great.  </li>
            <li> , it is almost certain to harbor a considerable amount of black slime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This model also has several useful features my previous model didn&#x27;t including shutting down if you are pressing too hard -especially useful for me - and remaining charge indicator.  </li>
            <li> The 1000 Professional is slightly smaller than my previous toothbrush and operates at a higher speed.  </li>
            <li> I recently moved to a different state &amp; I have a new dentist now.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Three weeks later, we get back a used charger and what appears to be a new 3000-series brush unit.  </li>
            <li> You can FEEL when the brush has hit a 30 second mark (it does a 1/4 second &amp;#34;stop&amp;#34; twice) and the continues brushing, so you can move to a new quadrant of your mouth.  </li>
            <li> The first charge seems to take a very long time and it doesn&#x27;t seem to hold a charge as long as advertised.</li>
            <li> Powerful, long lasting on a single charge and with it&#x27;s built in timer</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the battery can not be easily replaced and the battery lasts about 2 years.</li>
            <li> The other elements of this success include brushing twice daily, flossing once thoroughly at night, and then a thorough water-picking at a low pressure after the floss (with my waterpik purchased from Amazon, of course).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a quantum leap forward in speed, feel and handling from my previous Vitality for which I paid around the same price that i was able to buy this 1000 model due to a current sale.</li>
            <li> It did not even hurt his gums when he first started using although his previous toothbrushes were either non-electric or battery operated kids brushes.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this one since the battery recharges electrically, and it is so much better than the other, cheaper models I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
            <li> I ordered this particular toothbrush to replace one of the same description that finally quit working after 14 years of daily use.  </li>
            <li> Its hard to get excited about a toothbrush, but he likes it.</li>
            <li> The only option we had on our first was a 2 minute timer that let you know you had brushed long enough.</li>
            <li> When it&#x27;s low the light turns red, when it&#x27;s charging it blinks green, and when it&#x27;s done charging it goes blank.</li>
            <li> The electric toothbrush has really helped with my dental hygiene overall and makes a big difference from the standard toothbrush (especially if you are like me and don&#x27;t floss).</li>
            <li> /&gt;So, after using that one for a few years, I finally upgraded to my 3rd Oral-B - this one, the PRO 1000 - which is just right!  </li>
            <li> Toothbrushes purchased at the local grocer are never able to give me the clean mouth feel that an Oral-B electric brush does.  </li>
            <li> and this one seems to put them back in tame territory, and that clean feeling is addictive</li>
            <li> I think that this toothbrush has the advantage that it is very affordable compared to other brands.</li>
            <li> It is a little loud, but my teeth feel much cleaner than with Sonicare.  </li>
            <li> Much cheaper than other options.</li>
            <li> Other reviews have said that they like how you \\&quot;don&#x27;t need to use as much toothpaste,\\&quot;</li>
            <li> One kept me from working too fast, the other reminded me that it&#x27;s time to finish</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really compare this to other electric tooth brushes as I&#x27;ve never owned any, but this seems to do the job</li>
            <li> Other than the price to replace the brush heads which are costly, I really like the Oral-B and will continue using it.</li>
            <li> The Oral-B brush, on the other hand, has one connecting point and a ring that seals very well.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other brands, but plan to stay with this one because I really like the way the toothbrush head cups each tooth.</li>
            <li> Isn&#x27;t hard to clean itself</li>
            <li> I like the small round brush head of this type of oral B because it fits better in my small mouth and reaches teeth better than larger brush heads especially the teeth in the back of my mouth.</li>
            <li> It charges the brush wirelessly, which is cool, and I honestly prefer the smaller base.</li>
            <li> I kept telling myself I couldn&#x27;t justify the money, but when I finally had the funds (and a recent dental visit showed me a few new &amp;#34;soft spots&amp;#34;), I said I would get</li>
            <li> I also really like the little bit smaller version for this new toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> I think this is a great product and easy to transition to from regular brushes - the base is also small</li>
            <li> Because the bush rotates at a high speed, it really cleans along the gum line,which will save me a small fortune in trips to the dentist.</li>
            <li> Either way it works really well and the base charges by inductance which is not only cool (albeit slow), but it makes the thing really easy to clean.</li>
            <li> only negative for me is the flashing light that tells you its charging.</li>
            <li> B000050FDE Oral-B Professional Care 1000 Power Toothbrush]]) sold at Amazon that has the same model number brush and comes with two different kinds of brush heads instead of the one head that comes in this package, and is cheaper.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used an Oral-B electric toothbrush for years and only recently switched to the Oral-B 1000 Professional.  </li>
            <li> B003UKM9CO Oral-B 1000 Professional Care 1000 Electric Toothbrush, White and Blue]]</li>
            <li> Oddly, I have an older Oral-B that is 4 years old, and is still working perfectly.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is a replacement for a similar model that lasted nearly 10 years and finally just stopped charging.</li>
            <li> bought the Oral-B Professional Care 1000 after checking the various Amazon reviews from others of their various models.</li>
            <li> I left my electronic at home and brought a regular old toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> Recently bought the extra soft heads.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll never go back to a regular old toothbrush again.</li>
            <li> this is the same quality as the old one, and works with the same brushes, it is a well built piece of equipment</li>
            <li> I prefer the Braun Oral-B electric brush to the Sonicare because of the smaller brush size that gets behind my teeth more effectively.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I know I have spent about 30 seconds on each quadrant no matter how I chose to break up the quadrants for that particular session.  </li>
            <li> I already own a lesser expensive model of the Oral b</li>
            <li> I am a little concerned about the toothbrush as it makes a funny noise with the motor.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;However, I believe that this product overall is a critical part of my regimen, and a manual brush or something cheaper would mess with success.</li>
            <li> The first time (and only time so far as I&#x27;ve only had it a few weeks)</li>
            <li> My new Dentist recommended this for gum disease in which I&#x27;ve just had to loose two teeth.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace a Braun Oral B electric toothbrush I have owned for over ten years--it still works just fine, but I thought I should have another one ready to replace it when it failed, as I assumed it must, eventually.  </li>
            <li> This is at least my third Oral-b electric toothbrush, the first was a AA battery powered model that wore out mainly from a lack of waterproofing.</li>
            <li> little bit on the noisey side&lt;br /&gt;-Takes a long time to go from a low battery to a full charge</li>
            <li> They are a tad bit loud as one of the other reviewers mentioned but I can live with it for 2 minutes twice daily.</li>
            <li> This one was about half the price of the first one I bought last year.</li>
            <li> The rest of the unit is the same as before, no complaints as it is easy to use, lasts a fairly long time and small enough to take on trips.</li>
            <li> Its annoying that there seems to be some kind of gunk that comes out of the top of the handle and runs down the side!</li>
            <li> Used different brand and was hard to clean.</li>
            <li> Will stop for a second on occasion when brushing the teeth, but that may be due to adding to much pressure.</li>
            <li> after I wait for the little light to stop flashing (indicating unit is charging because people like to set and watch little flashy lights for hours) which I suppose is much better than waiting for a simple solid green light to come on.</li>
            <li> Apparently its enough to give this toothbrush one star.</li>
            <li> The Triumph had several speeds for different brushes but the only brush I used was the Floss Action.  </li>
            <li> This is deceptive advertising which I never expected from a company such as Amazon.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had all that long and hope it holds us as well as my old one.</li>
            <li> The thing i hate most about thus brush is the 30 second timer instead of a sound</li>
            <li> This is my first electric toothbrush, so some of my views might be misplaced, but I thought they would still be valuable to those also looking to make the switch from a manual toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> , it pulses oddly a few times, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to time for exactly 30 seconds (comparing to myself and a timer).</li>
            <li> /&gt;The vibration feeling took a few days to get used to and my gums tingled at first.</li>
            <li> Excellent basic electric toothbrush without all the unnecessary and expensive add-ons.</li>
            <li> To get the full oral b experience it looks like you&#x27;ll have to spend at least 80</li>
            <li> This is my first electric toothbrush - I&#x27;ve been using this for a few days now</li>
            <li> The batteries get pretty crappy at holding a charge after a few years.</li>
            <li> The first one I had went dead within about a month.</li>
            <li> Just a side note, be careful not to buy the really rough replacement heads, because the toothbrush is already powerful enough.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like being taken, so I&#x27;m pretty harsh with the rating.</li>
            <li> round rotating brush head is exactly what I was looking for.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It has a small, powerful head that allows you to reach all areas of your mouth.  </li>
            <li> it is my first electric toothbrush,I like it and use it everyday.</li>
            <li> When my first one died, tried a few others for about 6 months, I had 2 cavities during that time.  </li>
            <li> Had an Oral B first for a few years, then changed to Sonicare.  </li>
            <li> These are hard to fit into the back of my mouth to reach the upper back teeth.</li>
            <li> I did this because I wanted my brush to last as long as possible and will do it with this new one too.  </li>
            <li> I did this because I wanted my brush to last as long as possible and will do it with this new one too.  </li>
            <li> Braun is no help, as they are obviously more interested in selling you a new toothbrush than helping replace your worthless charger.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is very loud and has a strong vibration that borders on uncomfortable to use.  </li>
            <li> Easy to hold when dry, otherwise grip is a little slippery when wet.</li>
            <li> One small gripe, the on/off button is kind of hard to find by touch.</li>
            <li> This electric toothbrush is fine, except for the fact that the button to turn it on is very hard to push.  </li>
            <li> Not too much discomfort, although it is slightly aggressive.</li>
            <li> Teeth cleanings are much easier with less pain at the dentist.  </li>
            <li> My dentist says my teeth are much cleaner than with the manual toothbrush I was using, with less plaque &amp; tartar.</li>
            <li> My dentist appointments are much shorter, I have a lot less plaque.</li>
            <li> I visit my dentist less often for cleanings, thanks to this brush.  </li>
            <li> Teeth seem much cleaner compared to the brush I was using previously.</li>
            <li> I also didn&#x27;t feel like I had much precision cleaning my teeth because the brush head is long and wide.</li>
            <li> It was a surprise to find that a smaller round brush head could work so much better than a standard larger round head or oval head electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t kept track exactly, but it appears to only need a recharge every few weeks.</li>
            <li> The first few days my gums bled, but now after a week they no longer bleed and there is definitely no buildup hiding at my gum-lines.</li>
            <li> Went to dentist after using it only a few weeks and for the first time in years they did not mention any problem with my gums.  </li>
            <li> It cleans your teeth so thoroughly that they truly feel &amp;#34;squeaky clean.&amp;#34; This may sound a little odd</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve went through several heads, which are a bit expensive and don&#x27;t last super long, but it works well enough to make it worth it.  </li>
            <li> This model also has the two minute pulse alert but it has two additional ones at about 45 second intervals but are less intense than the two minute alert.  </li>
            <li> These can also take the small round heads, or the larger more regular toothbrush looking heads -</li>
            <li> I hope they don&#x27;t stop making new brush heads for it over the next few years like they did my old one.  </li>
            <li> I am on my second one (and the first one is still going strong but has acquired an unpleasant odor over time which I cannot get rid of.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush needs to be charged only once every 2 or 3 weeks and has a courtesy reminder light that indicates weak power.</li>
            <li> I decided to purchase this after my old Oral-B electric toothbrush finally started to loose its strength after 6-7 years.</li>
            <li> The only bad thing about it is that it is annoyingly loud, not too big of deal, but just have to be thoughtful if your significant other is asleep nearby.</li>
            <li> Seeing as I am now really &amp;#34;into&amp;#34; obsessive brushing and compulsive flossing, this little number is a godsend.</li>
            <li> Love the small charger!!!  </li>
            <li> Also, I have found the rotating action of the head allows you to position it in hard-to-reach areas and then just allow it to do its work, whereas it&#x27;s much less likely to get sufficient cleaning action manually - especially if, like me, you still have some wisdom teeth left</li>
            <li> The new brush comes with a smaller base with no storage which is all I would need anyway.&lt;br /&gt;You could pay much more and get the more expensive models with all the additional bells and whistles, but do you really need them?</li>
            <li> I have sensitive teeth, so was a little worried; but so far no issues.</li>
            <li> The other possible issue is that Braun&#x27;s guarantee requires the consumer to pay shipping to return the toothbrush if it develops problems, whereas Norelco sends you a new one with a postage-paid label to return the defective one.</li>
            <li> A different used charger and a brush handle that also appears to be other than new.  </li>
            <li> use traditional way to wash my teeth for decades, and replace a new one every other month.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The ergonomics are not fantastic due to battery,but you quickly learn to adapt to it for proper brushing.&lt;br /&gt;All</li>
            <li> I am not sure if there is a need for variable speeds, since I only use the high speed, but the Oral B 1000 only offers 1&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought this to use while I waited for Norelco to send me a replacement for a defective Sonicare (the second one to go bad, but Norelco has been good about replacing them at no cost).  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Trust me, if you replace the standard head with a floss head (same price for the head), you will get the same highly dentist rated results shown by Consumers Magazine at half the price.</li>
            <li> Read a few articles and studies which stated that there&#x27;s no true advantage between an electric toothbrush versus a solid clean with your manual brush.</li>
            <li> It comes with two brush heads - one is the little round one, the other is a larger one that&#x27;s supposed to remove more plaque</li>
            <li> Did not last for long (battery recharging failed in less than 6 months), but it was a good toothbrush while it worked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:</li>
            <li> , I mean it takes almost a whole day to fully charge when it&#x27;s nearly completely drained.</li>
            <li> As an adult who knows how to brush my teeth, the 4 timer pauses (as quick as they are) interrupt and slow down my brushing process.</li>
            <li> SO worth the relatively small amount of money for it!  </li>
            <li> the new brush is not as good as the previous one, but is not that bad.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not saying they make a bad product, but the Oral-B brush gets your teeth every bit as clean, cost considerably less, and are more reliable and long lasting.  </li>
            <li> So, I use it only once in a while and usually stick to my regular electric toothbrush, the Oral B with 2 minute warning, simple, gentle on my gums and teeth, and it only cost me about $25.00.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The brushes in the Professional Care series on the other hand add quadrant timers, and are rated both at 8800 oscillations per second and at 40,000 pulsations per second.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I researched for days, being completely taken aback by horror stories of gum bleeding and other problems caused by such devices.</li>
            <li> I never even considered any other when my old one finally died.</li>
            <li> The PC 1000&#x60;s head combines a rapid vibrating motion with a rotating action; you use it not by vigorously scrubbing back and forth against the wall of your closed teeth, but by slowly running the brush first over your gums and then over and around each tooth individually.</li>
            <li> Simple, effective, and not that expensive!  </li>
            <li> The price point is around 35 dollars, doesnt take 2 days to reach a full charge, so in other words dont waste ur time, or fall victim to their misleading visual marketing.</li>
            <li> I replaced my older Braun (at least 7 yrs old that still works) with this one.  </li>
            <li> I decided to take my old manual toothbrush with me on vacation the other weekend</li>
            <li> Although I still floss and use a Proxa Brush between my teeth before brushing with the Oral B Professional 1000, doing this routine after breakfast and supper, I&#x27;ve stopped using all the other electronic tooth brushes I used before.</li>
            <li> only downside is that the head on this brush is rather small, so it takes quite a bit of rubbing on my neck, temples or back to have any real impact.</li>
            <li> My other Oral B Professional toothbrush lasted over 2 years.  </li>
            <li> This is a replacement for ours that broke(not due to manufacture default but 11 and 7 yr old boys dropping it repeatedly).</li>
            <li> It works very well, but the neck is a little too long for me.</li>
            <li> replaced my old one due to battery not holding a charge anymore probably because I over charged it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also easier to reach way around the back teeth, considering the smaller, round head in comparison to a normal toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After doing quite a bit of research I also found that the only differences between the Professional Care 1000 and higher models like the 4000 and 5000 are the number of brush modes and unnecessary add-ons like timers and displays on the toothbrush itself.</li>
            <li> &gt; The price seemed a little high....</li>
            <li> the other hand, a sonic brush, with its higher frequency, cleans about as well with less noise.</li>
            <li> In fact, the only reason I needed to replace the old one was because the plastic \\&quot;keys\\&quot; on the handle which slots on the brush unit \\&quot;keyed\\&quot; into had worn down over years of daily use.  </li>
            <li> You know how they recommend that you change your toothbrush every three months or so, well based on the difference between this model and my previous Oral B electric brush, I recommend springing for a new electric brush every couple of years and not just the brush heads.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint about the new brush is that it signals (by a hesitation pulse) every 30 seconds, instead of just after two minutes--which is what the old brush does.  </li>
            <li> My teeth never felt this clean with my previous ordinary toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> It is a better and faster replacement for the previous model and, conveniently, the brush heads fit both.&lt;br /&gt;After one minute of brushing, there is a pause which is annoying.  </li>
            <li> toothbrush holds charge for a long time, so I only plug it in when the low battery indicator comes on.</li>
            <li> Still, all of these rechargeable batteries have the same problem: they never last as long as they are supposed to.</li>
            <li> Hope this one will last as long as the last one.</li>
            <li> , I definitely wasn&#x27;t brushing long enough before.</li>
            <li> They were used just a few hours after charging them up and mankind, we could feel the cleaning difference over our older rechargeable Vitality brushes.  </li>
            <li> There are no frills here--no extra attachments, no carrying case--just a tiny charger and a simple toothbrush with a single setting.</li>
            <li> With the smaller size head, I could get to all the hard to reach dental surfaces such as the back of the very posterior molars plus the inside of the incisors and canines.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It takes about 16 hours to re-charge and its recommended to completely run down the battery once a month to make it last longer.</li>
            <li> They do suggest completely running the charge down every 6 months to make it last longer.</li>
            <li> Werewolves might require something of more industrial strength, but this is a MUST for those humans who really don&#x27;t want their teeth to slowly rot right out of their very heads in a gruesome, yellowing spiral of abject decay.</li>
            <li> Teeth get really clean and the small head gets into all the tight places.</li>
            <li> I had been using an older version of the current Oral-B 3000 model for the past 8 years, but it finally broke.  </li>
            <li> We only replaced it because it was starting to not keep a charge very long.</li>
            <li> It works very well with very little effort.  </li>
            <li> , in case you don&#x27;t know, always take the head off of the brush, rinse well, and leave it off to dry, just putting back on the next time you brush.  </li>
            <li> The charger is much smaller than my old one, so it takes up less space.</li>
            <li> Works well as replacement of previous unit (13 years old), the reminder feature is especially helpful to insure you get the job done.</li>
            <li> Now, that&#x27;s not a big deal if you&#x27;re single, but when two of you are using the same handle, then one of you isn&#x27;t going to have any place to put your brush head...but not to fear, for a meer $7.00 (plus $5.15 shipping &amp; handling) you can now BUY the holder!  </li>
            <li> Sometime around late 2005, I bought my first Oral-B.  </li>
            <li> Again, just an adjustment thing, so I&#x27;ll keep working to find a way to brush without forcing so much saliva past my lips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> charger is small and compact: it won&#x27;t take much space up on your counter.  </li>
            <li> As usual Amazon&#x27;s service was fast.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small rotor heads really covers each tooth.</li>
            <li> Not sure how much difference it&#x27;ll make yet in terms of cavities reduction.</li>
            <li> Not sure how much longer it would have lasted beyond that.  </li>
            <li> not sure how much the vibration did for cleaning my teach.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s long lasting and require no maintenance.</li>
            <li> Battery is long lasting.</li>
            <li> My wife and I do not find that this a problem since the battery life on each is long lasting.</li>
            <li> This one does have a few different brush options for sensitive teeth and gums, but only one speed</li>
            <li> It takes a long time to charge but once it is charged it last all week.</li>
            <li> battery doesn&#x27;t last long and Design is too bulky.</li>
            <li> and the charge lasted long enough to get me through a 3-day power outage.  </li>
            <li> For a really long time now, it wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge - just long enough for me to use it once, then I&#x27;d have to stick it back on the charger again.</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s long enough for me to tell that I&#x27;m like this toothbrush a lot.</li>
            <li> I understand from ftriend that they last a long time too.</li>
            <li> Only one minor thing I don&#x27;t like is the &#x27;reminder&#x27; pauses after every 30 seconds of brushing -</li>
            <li> and they last a long time.</li>
            <li> I realized I have not been brushing long enough per the timer on this unit.  </li>
            <li> I just wanted an electric toothbrush that simply brushed my teeth as long as I kept it running.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;this will never stop functioning as long as it is charged on regular basis..</li>
            <li> Also doesn&#x27;t show a time so that you know how long you have brushed.</li>
            <li> Allegedly there is a sensitive teeth setting, doesn&#x27;t seem any different from the other two (whitening and regular).</li>
            <li> The flashing charging light would not stop blinking and the handle &amp; base became very hot</li>
            <li> Generally not the thig to do, but</li>
            <li> but this brush has been the true game changer for me.  </li>
            <li> I like the brushing action of the new brush for its tight and controlled feel in comparison to the previous one which seemed softer and looser with longer strokes.  </li>
            <li> This particular one has a small rotating head which reaches the back of my molars.</li>
            <li> My old Oral-B electric toothbrush had put in very long service, and was gradually slowing down; I&#x27;d lost track of how terrific one of these brushes could be.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much thinner than other electric toothbrushes, so it is less tiring to hold.</li>
            <li> Not major - just an annoyance.</li>
            <li> Hopefully this toothbrush will last a long time!</li>
            <li> I have had one like this for a few years now and got a new one for my husband.  </li>
            <li> In my case, after a very long search, I found a replacement charger for $55 (plus shipping) for my $50 toothbrush at some third party site, but not amazon.  </li>
            <li> After inserting a small stiff brush in every crevice I could  see and shaking the brush head again, more black slime appeared.</li>
            <li> Even though this happened within the first year, the supposed warranty is so absurd -- you have to keep the original receipt, not just the original proof of purchase -- that it is impossible to take advantage of it.</li>
            <li> I owned a previous 8 year old model that still works and updated to this one just because.</li>
            <li> As for the timer, well I think it&#x27;s useless, but not annoying enough to worry about, I just keep brushing away</li>
            <li> /&gt;In short:&lt;br /&gt;You can get a rechargeable toothbrush that uses the same heads for half the price at most grocery stores (either Oral-B or a generic brand) that doesn&#x27;t have all of these useless upgrades.</li>
            <li> I have used the Oral-B 1000 Professional Care only for a few days</li>
            <li> The brush heads last a long time as long as you rinse them off and store them</li>
            <li> I bought 5 of this item, one for each of my family members, and expected to get $100 rebate and received only $20 in total.</li>
            <li> Slow and gentle is the key to using this thing.  </li>
            <li> So far it works, but I hate the fact that this one is longer than the two older ones I had because now it doesn&#x27;t fit upright on the shelf where I kept the others.</li>
            <li> It is very loud and harsh on the teeth.  </li>
            <li> Bursts are limited and very short.</li>
            <li> Now only single speed vs. dual -</li>
            <li> Last about 5 days of two a day brushing on single charge.</li>
            <li> small head and the power means I am doing a better job of cleaning behind my back teeth</li>
            <li> One is fast and 2nd is just a little less faster.  </li>
            <li> charging station has a small footprint which is very helpful for the old fashioned lavatory I have at the office which has very little space for items kept constantly available.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make an annoying sound when you&#x27;re using it, the charging process is seamless and simple, and it&#x27;s not heavy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used some other kinds and brands of electric toothbrushes (all more expensive than this one)</li>
            <li> Having used other electronic toothbrushes, I found this one brushes harder than others and isn&#x27;t as soft bear the gum line.</li>
            <li> I timed myself with a regular toothbrush &amp; realized I&#x27;ve always only brushed for less than a minute.  </li>
            <li> The base is small, easy to clean, and the battery stays charged for all three family members to brush our teeth, back to back even!</li>
            <li> The more expensive ones have other programs or options, but this cleans as well as any of them.</li>
            <li> However, the next brushing cycle will abruptly end after about a minute and THEN indicates that the battery is low and must be charged.</li>
            <li> The reason I&#x27;m commenting now is I&#x27;m thinking of buying another Pro 1000 model before the battery gives out on my present one, especially since I don&#x27;t need those other features of the newer models.</li>
            <li> Compared to other much more expensive mechanical brushes.</li>
            <li> it is very thin so it can be easily packed  for traveling.</li>
            <li> It is a little loud, but I think they all are.</li>
            <li> THe head is small enough to reach hard to reach areas and will surround and clean each tooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My wife always says I brush too hard since my toothbrush heads wear out twice as fast as hers.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;-pressure cutoff doesn&#x27;t really work, claims to stop brushing if you push too hard.</li>
            <li> It is a little investment upfront for the brush and to buy replacement brush heads (buy good-rated generic on Amazon) but the deep cleaning will definitely save you money in dental services!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> In the direction packet it states other models have two modes, one for \\&quot;daily use\\&quot; and one for sensitive teeth that has less pressure.</li>
            <li> In the direction packet it states other models have two modes, one for \\&quot;daily use\\&quot; and one for sensitive teeth that has less pressure.</li>
            <li> Replaced one same brand that was at least 15 years old!!</li>
            <li> I read a bunch of reviews and articles about electric toothbrushes when I was looking for a replacement for my old one, and I found that dentists and experts agree there is very little, if any difference between various types of motions in electric brushes.</li>
            <li> charger has a small foot print so it does&#x27;nt take up much room on the counter.&lt;br /&gt;5)I work on a boat and even in rough seas</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m assuming it does something like clear the memory on the battery when you allow it to go completely dead.    </li>
            <li> Over the past several years, I have had excess plaque and sensitive gums on every 6mo checkup at the dentist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t need an electric toothbrush to tell me how long to brush my teeth.</li>
            <li> But those are minor flaws that shouldn&#x27;t dissuade anyone from buying this</li>
            <li> Wanted an electric toothbrush for a long time, and got this with a 50% off rebate and couldnt be happier.</li>
            <li> I have been using Oral-B electric brushes for as long as I can remember.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> (see below) are minor.  </li>
            <li> A brush head is expected to last about three months.  </li>
            <li> Long battery life (2 weeks before recharging).</li>
            <li> : The drawback is the long charging time for the battery.</li>
            <li> I have been using Oral B toothbrushes for quite a long time.  </li>
            <li> I periodically put on a pair of 2.5 diopter reading glasses and usually am dismayed at the amount of plaque buildup I see with normal brushing.</li>
            <li> You would be amazed at how long 3 minutes (the recommended brushing time) is.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It does not have the remote pressure sensor and smiley indicator as the highest end model but in terms of brushing works just the same</li>
            <li> I chose the 1000 model as opposed to the more expensive because it is the same thing, except for a few things that you do not need.</li>
            <li> I bought it to replace my old model which lasted a few years</li>
            <li> I am finding that after about 2.5 years of use the battery is not holding a charge as long; I need to charge it twice weekly, now.</li>
            <li> toothbrush gives timed signals to let you know how long you&#x27;ve been brushing.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s just to let you know how long it&#x27;s been going.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s see how long the battery lasts.</li>
            <li> Battery life not as long as I would expect..needs charging every 3-4 days.</li>
            <li> Cons: long time to recharge, like 24 - 48 hours.</li>
            <li> Charge lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> Internal timer vibrates at 15 sec.</li>
            <li> I like the size of this one and that you can take it off the charger and it lasts a LONG time before it needs recharging.</li>
            <li> so you know how long you have been brushing.</li>
            <li> When you charge this unit, it does take a long time to charge, but it doesn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
            <li> but I wonder if I got one that was sitting around in the warehouse too long.</li>
            <li> Wish i had not waited so long to purchase one.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Had I known the difference between the starter level and this one, I would have spent the extra 10 or 15 bucks for this one.</li>
            <li> Hoping to be using this one for just as long.  </li>
            <li> Received this a few days ago as an early Christmas gift and I use this as a toothbrush and polisher for my teeth.</li>
            <li> I submitted the rebate several weeks ago, however no reply from the rebate center.</li>
            <li> However this is a minor point compared to the build quality and value for money.</li>
            <li> also am an &#x27;over-brusher&#x27;, so I tend to brush too long and too vigorously, and have caused some unneccessary gum receding and enamel damage.  </li>
            <li> Just don&#x27;t over-brush.f, even though it is not completely drained.  </li>
            <li> long enough.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The battery lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> so you know how long you need to brush.</li>
            <li> Stays charged for a long time without being on the charger dock.</li>
            <li> Hope this one lasts as long.</li>
            <li> The battery technology is different in the Oral B, but I&#x27;m not really one to take</li>
            <li> Beware, charging times are LONG.</li>
            <li> I wish I had this a long time ago.  </li>
            <li> runs for a long time</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe I waited so long to switch.</li>
            <li> Minor points, I suppose.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s way too long.  </li>
            <li> I cannot believe i have waited so long to get an electronic toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> so you know how long you&#x27;re brushing your teeth.</li>
            <li> but it took a long time to be fully charged.</li>
            <li> and I plan on having it for a long time.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think the battery lasts as long as advertised though.</li>
            <li> can get brush heads without going to the dentist or grey market.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It stays charged up for a long time.  </li>
            <li> Long battery life.</li>
            <li> Arrived earlier than expected.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe I waiting so long to get this.</li>
            <li> so you know how long you&#x27;re brushing is section to get two minutes of brushing in.</li>
            <li> People need to be told where and how long to brush&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I hope this one lasts as long as the one its replacing.</li>
            <li> Battery lasts for a long time before you need to recharge it again, around a week or so.</li>
            <li> As a premium product I would have expected the product to last longer, I also contacted P&amp;G about this, and here is their response in it&#x27;s entirety.  </li>
            <li> Works well and holds charge for a long time.</li>
            <li> Wish I bought this long ago.</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve had this for a few months and think I picked a winner.</li>
            <li> The only con I have on it is every 30 sec.</li>
            <li> it just didn&#x27;t hold a charge as long as it used to.  </li>
            <li> Took me a long time do decide on an electric brush.  </li>
            <li> how long I brush in each quarter of my mouth.</li>
            <li> Thanks!!!e time how long I brush in each quarter of my mouth.</li>
            <li> I like the auto &amp;#34;you&#x27;ve been brushing your teeth too long feature&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> No idea what took me so long.</li>
            <li> Hold a charge for a long time.</li>
            <li> But then the old one returned from the dead and gave us another 5 years.  </li>
            <li> No matter how long and carefully I manually brushed, I could not achieve the thorough cleaning that I got with power brushing.</li>
            <li> The first one got left behind somewhere.  </li>
            <li> One slow and one fast.</li>
            <li> designed, replaceable heads, surprisingly sturdy base, and the&lt;br /&gt;Built in, rather non-intrusive, 2 minute</li>
            <li> (I had an older one with the bigger base and it would get dirty and it was hard to clean) and works great.</li>
            <li> The part that enters your mouth is not sealed and there is an opening further down the head which is still outside your mouth.</li>
            <li> I used it twice a day exclusively, and it only just broke down last week.</li>
            <li> To me, this timer is just something else that will break down after a short period.you get splattered with toothpaste spit removing it from your month while on) it remembers where you were and when you turn it back on...</li>
            <li> That model does look a little different, though, maybe a little bulkier in the handle, so it may be an older version.  </li>
            <li> kinda of product .. means to last a little while but not particularly long.  </li>
            <li> The next day after having charged the new brush for at least 20 hours as the instructions recommended I used it for literally 30 seconds and it quit working.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, this Oral-B model is acceptable, though I question why it&#x27;s so much better than some of its less expensive counterparts</li>
            <li> I previously had a more expensive model and can tell the difference in quality.</li>
            <li> I purchased this to replace my previous Oral B Triumph (equivalent to the Oral B 4000 current model) that wore out after several years of use.</li>
            <li> Recently I got braces and my teeth started getting a yellow tan because it&#x27;s not very easy to get in between the braces.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a feature with this Oral-B that didn&#x27;t exist with my previous ones -- while operating, it is programmed to hesitate for a couple of second every couple of minutes, as a cue to the length of time that a quadrant of your mouth should be brushed.  </li>
            <li> I was a bit hesitant to purchase what I thought would be a downgrade, but I figured I only ever used one of the speeds on my old toothbrush, so I might as well save a few bucks and not pay for the other two modes that I would never use.  </li>
            <li> The two-year limited warrantee is worthless: we&#x27;d have to ship it back at our own expense (a $15 proposition) and get it back a month later (assuming there are no delays due to weather or holidays).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone past the return date with Amazon, and I will get a new toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Live that the charging port is so small too.</li>
            <li> Just replaced my plain old Oral-B that I have had for years.  </li>
            <li> after several days use, my teeth seems whitened a little bit.but one-time charge can not last that long than i thought.</li>
            <li> It has just enough features for me, and I like that the base of the toothbrush is wide enough to stand on its own.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-A single charge lasts about a week when brushing 2x per day&lt;br /&gt;-Built-in timer w/ vibration helps gauge how long you&#x27;ve been brushing</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it takes abnormally long to finish completely charging.</li>
            <li> and the charge lasts a long time!  </li>
            <li> Assuming it lasts as long as its predecessor, I heartily recommend this toothbrush!</li>
            <li> other thing that is very different is the way is moves the saliva around in your mouth.  </li>
            <li> (2) the opportunity to see by graph the depletion of your battery&#x27;s charge (3) complicate your brushing by using multiple heads, whitening and perhaps other procedures.  </li>
            <li> This toothbrush has enough power that with the other heads I could see going overboard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The charge dock is extremely convenient, and I have currently had no issues with it retaining a charge on trips I have taken.</li>
            <li> My bathroom is very small without much counter space.  </li>
            <li> This one is a little different as the head is smaller than what I am used to.</li>
            <li> This caught my eye mainly due to price -- after the manufacturer rebate the final cost was</li>
            <li> The other improvement is the shorter, 30 second warnings which time your quarterly mouth brushing routine.</li>
            <li> but I only use it every other day.</li>
            <li> Just be aware of this weak point and go for it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this unit as a replacement (I purchased TWO replacements, diff models, will comment on other in different review).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Bought this a gift and haven&#x27;t heard any complaints besides that it&#x27;s a little loud then expected.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried the others, but they are likely well made, like other products I&#x27;ve had made by Braun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried the others, but they are likely well made, like other products I&#x27;ve had made by Braun.  </li>
            <li> This is a big improvement over other powered brushes that I have used.</li>
            <li> About a year ago the battery started to loose it&#x27;s ability to hold a charge for long.  </li>
            <li> It is made in Germany and is very high quality, not like the cheap crap you get from China.</li>
            <li> first thing I noticed when I turned the brush on and started to use it, was that the bristles were very hard compared to what I had been using.</li>
            <li> That Sonicare lasted a very long time.  </li>
            <li> stays charged VERY long</li>
            <li> However, the charging takes a very long time - almost 24 hours.</li>
            <li> My teeth feel noticeably cleaner after brushing (compared to a standard toothbrush), and I find it works especially well to clean in the hard to reach area behind molars.</li>
            <li> reason I got interested in the electronic toothbrushes, is I tend to brush up and down too hard</li>
            <li> My other brush (oral b spinbrush)  had the same rule about changing heads, but I let mine go for almost 6 months and never had a problem with it wearing down or teeth and gums not getting cleaned, so I am hoping this will last as long.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Rinsing and leaving it to dry will not prevent it.</li>
            <li> Once rinsed, I dry the brush and brush holder tip with a towel, momentarily running the brush holder as I wipe it dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> so they dry out.  </li>
            <li> Having to remove the brush head each time to rinse and then let dry is another disadvantage.  </li>
            <li> No complaints after several recharges and twice daily use for a few months.</li>
            <li> The Sonicare is quieter and has an auto shut-off that the Braun lacks, but the Braun&#x27;s smaller, round brush head makes it easier to reach farther back in the mouth.  </li>
            <li> When I first used it I felt it was a bit harsh on my teeth, but I usually use a manual, non-electric toothbrush</li>
            <li> To start with the negative:  I preferred my former (abt 10 years old)</li>
            <li> I agree that you should brush all your teeth for a minimal of 2 minutes of total brushing time but the 30 Sec timer should be removed or the consumer given the option of disabling it.&lt;br /&gt;3</li>
            <li> I agree that you should brush all your teeth for a minimal of 2 minutes of total brushing time but the 30 Sec timer should be removed or the consumer given the option of disabling it.&lt;br /&gt;3</li>
            <li> After the last few charging cycles, I have noticed that the unit will not indicate that the battery is low and needs to be recharged.</li>
            <li> I also hate the fact that every time I go to try and put the brush on, I always end up holding the darn thing backwards as that&#x27;s what feels more natural</li>
            <li> It would run down sitting in a suitcase on a trip and be quite slow that night in the hotel unless it had charging time first.</li>
            <li> So apparently the unit doesn&#x27;t seal to the brush somehow, despite the little o-rings that come with the brush heads.</li>
            <li> Hope to get at least that long with the new one.</li>
            <li> I like the smaller charger base and new timer on this new one which is different than my old one.  </li>
            <li> I get months of use out of a single head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought this one because it is a single.  </li>
            <li> It says you can brush twice a day for two weeks on a single charge.</li>
            <li> The description indicates there is a 2 year limited warranty</li>
            <li> It comes with a single disposable brush head.</li>
            <li> It lasts quite a while on a single charge; we don&#x27;t have an outlet in the bathroom of our 1905 house &amp;</li>
            <li> I got 12 days use out of a single charge.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Buying another Costco pair seemed wasteful, since the wife&#x27;s is still working well; so, I started shopping around for a single unit.</li>
            <li> Every single time I brush with this, I get that super-clean feeling I get after going to the dentist for a cleaning.  </li>
            <li> disappointed - expected more from major brand.  </li>
            <li> Granted this might make the Oral B electric less \\&quot;green\\&quot; than an old-fashioned toothbrush, but in the whole scheme of things, I think it&#x27;s a small price to pay for a life time of oral health.</li>
            <li> Hopefully it will last as long as my previous Oral-B Toothbrush--about six years.</li>
            <li> Personally, I do not understand this stupid limitation in the charger, because this is a European product and there most of the electronic stuffs like this are multivoltage.</li>
            <li> I bought this Oral-B electric toothbrush to replace the old one I have been using for the past 15-to-20 years.  </li>
            <li> I have used the Oral B Sonic Complete and the Philips Sonicare toothbruses in the past.  </li>
            <li> i like it , i have used Oral-b in the past , i bought one for my husband ,so far he seems to like it .</li>
            <li> that a manual toothbrush can and that using it for fourteen days will help arrest or even partially reverse the progress of gingivitis.</li>
            <li> that a manual toothbrush can and that using it for fourteen days will help arrest or even partially reverse the progress of gingivitis.</li>
            <li> It gives a brief &#x27;pulse&#x27; every 30 seconds to remind you to switch quadrants - personally I find this annoying but not terribly so.</li>
            <li> Keeps charge for a long time, longer than expected.</li>
            <li> I really liked this toothbrush but it stopped charging after two months :(</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not like the old school electrics that were weak and barely wiggled</li>
            <li> /&gt;Having used it for a few months now, I have no regrets.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t pay full price, I&#x27;ll never admit that I need to change the head, they&#x27;re so expensive.</li>
            <li> I just try to remember to grip the brush loosely.</li>
            <li> After all these years it finally broke down.</li>
            <li> Only down side charging takes a day</li>
            <li> the only down side is that this doesn&#x27;t seem to have the &amp;#34;sensitive&amp;#34; mode, it says it does, but maybe mine is &#x27;defective&#x27; -</li>
            <li> The only thing that might bring the experience down is the replacement heads.</li>
            <li> As the spit starts running down your chin, you finally find the on/off</li>
            <li> As the spit starts running down your chin, you finally find the on/off</li>
            <li> To me, this timer is just something else that will break down after a short period.</li>
            <li> I recently upgraded to the Professional Care 1000 toothbrush from an older, less expensive model.</li>
            <li> I found a new dentist and discovered that their office was basically a &amp;#34;tooth spa&amp;#34; ... Or at least they were attempting to craft the illusion (&amp;#34;Lavender neck pillow, sir?&amp;#34; &amp;#34;Glass of water from the freshwater springs of the midi-Pyrenees?&amp;#34; &amp;#34;Would you let to pet one of our Relaxation Rabbits?&amp;#34;).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I did try to really press down hard on it</li>
            <li> pretty much got the bad news of cavities and gum disease.  </li>
            <li> but by encouraging you to change your brushing habits to optimize tooth cleaning and gum health.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brushing with it is such a different experience from using any ordinary, manual toothbrush, that just reading the instruction-sheet can leave you standing there staring as you wonder about the brushing habits you&#x27;ve had for a lifetime.</li>
            <li> This is my second Oral-B electric toothbrush, my first failed after years and years of reliable service because the battery could no longer hold a charge.  </li>
            <li> Just what I needed - however I saw the same thing at Target for less.....</li>
            <li> I had a previous model that finally wore out after about 8 years.  </li>
            <li> This is my second electric tooth brush, the fist Oral B having worked as usual for over ten years.</li>
            <li> Brush heads are much smaller than manual toothbrush, so they hold less toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> I found small writing on the back and one side to indicate this model has one mode brushing which they say is for daily use.</li>
            <li> I found small writing on the back and one side to indicate this model has one mode brushing which they say is for daily use.</li>
            <li> actually they bleed less with this than they did with a brush</li>
            <li> Why limit yourself to a small work surface when the bigger head can take double?</li>
            <li> /&gt;Those vibrating chairs and pillows and personal massage doohickeys look pretty inviting -- but they&#x27;re always so expensive.</li>
            <li> There are slight modifications, but basically this is the same Oral-B&lt;br /&gt;toothbrush</li>
            <li> I figured it was the same version as my previous one without any bells and whistles.  </li>
            <li> about ten dollars just has one less speed.  </li>
            <li> she recently lost her other charger to her other brush</li>
            <li> The brush is small enough that I can reach all the way to the back teeth.  </li>
            <li> really like the small round toothbrush head.</li>
            <li> Also, the photo here is misleading, there&#x27;s NO extra brush head dock that comes with this brush, only the small charger came with it.</li>
            <li> The first one lasted for three years with twice daily use (i was sad that it died, but i&#x27;ve heard that&#x27;s the case with rechargeable batteries).</li>
            <li> I got mine for $35, and the next time I searched Amazon I couldn&#x27;t find them for less than 65.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had it for a few weeks, so we&#x27;ll have to see how the battery works in the long term.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This model is lighter, smaller, less noisy, and seems to run smoother and faster than the Costco version (or</li>
            <li> Maybe my next dentist bill will be less.</li>
            <li> My wife purchased this for me from Amazon for Christmas because my previous Oral-B of 10 years cratered, so technically I am a verified buyer</li>
            <li> , as a previous Oral-b user I expect the brush to work the same way</li>
            <li> So I am brushing and then about a half a minute the thing makes this godawful stutter then starts back up again.</li>
            <li> This was half the cost of my local stores.  </li>
            <li> Then you are stuck trying to buy a replacement, because braun/oral-b often changes designs and subsequent models often do not work with previous chargers.</li>
            <li> The previous model I had came with three brushes, I didn&#x27;t need a larger version.</li>
            <li> Got this when it was on sale for less than a third of retail price (assuming the mail-in-rebate comes).</li>
            <li> This Oral-B toothbrush charges really quickly and the replacement heads are not too expensive.</li>
            <li> Bought this due to some minor dental issues.  </li>
            <li> First a hairline crack developed near the base where it sits on the charger.</li>
            <li> It only has one speed and the brush felt harder on the gum comparing to my previous one (which was gone after 10 years, it had two speed).  </li>
            <li> I bought this as a replacement for an older Oral-B power toothbrush because I was fed up with the effort required to clean the charging base.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t brush very hard.  </li>
            <li> He said if it gets frayed, it does not clean properly.</li>
            <li> I like it only had it for a little bit</li>
            <li> but my husband said it feels a little too big.  </li>
            <li> This is my 3rd OralB toothbrush and the company must be making cutbacks because it no longer comes with those little pegs that you use to put your toothbrush heads on.</li>
            <li> We pop the brush heads off and keep them in a little container next to the brush where it sits on</li>
            <li> This little machine is simple and gets the job done!</li>
            <li> I thought after reading the reviews this might be something a little different that I would like.  </li>
            <li> is just a little bigger than the bottom of the toothbrush bottom</li>
            <li> \\&quot;Why don&#x27;t you just brush a little harder with the regular kind?\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I cannot detect any difference in action no matter how hard I push against my teeth.</li>
            <li> I tend to brush too hard, and this product nearly stops when I do so, so that feature is a plus for me.</li>
            <li> it stop (i.e. not very consistent.</li>
            <li> I am still using the original base with the new brush.</li>
            <li> and I am actually brushing for the entire 2 minutes where I used to hardly ever do that.</li>
            <li> , they were loud and vibrated really hard, and were  really rough on my teeth.</li>
            <li> Product description is not accurate: there is no pressure indicator on this toothbrush and it does not stop if you apply too much pressure—press as hard on it as you like and</li>
            <li> earlier units were basically the same but had multiple speeds and a large charging base to hold multiple brush heads, both of which I never used.  </li>
            <li> Some people have commented on the sound being too loud (not) and it cutting out being a problem when they are brushing too hard (not a problem...</li>
            <li> This is far better as it has a 2 minute timer with vibrational queues so each quadrant is cleaned; a sensor to let you know if you&#x27;re brushing too hard; smaller charging base.</li>
            <li> The new charging base also makes it easier to clean.</li>
            <li> I have had a history of bad plaque build up, which is when I started with the Braun, and now is even better with the Oral-B.  </li>
            <li> my only complaint is that it&#x27;s kinda ugly, but it does the job, and it does it amazingly well, so i still give it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely a difference in clean that you can feel and is impossible to achieve with a manual brush.</li>
            <li> This was extremely painful to clean because I would have to twist the head off, pop out the brush head, clean the round base, and then clean the handle mouth.</li>
            <li> This is a really powerful toothbrush!&lt;br /&gt;Despite having a couple of front facing fillings (the dentist called them buckles) reveal them selves to be defective once I started using this toothbrush (they got knocked off, thannnnnks old dentist, grrr)</li>
            <li> This is the 3rd one I have owned and theses things last at least 3 plus years.  </li>
            <li> the next go round.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s because I like the smaller /  round head.</li>
            <li> it is not the toothbrush i expected to get.</li>
            <li> The charger is a lot bulkier than expected.</li>
            <li> you already know how to brush your teeth, all the extra&#x27;s are a waste of money in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I called Oral B who said that it should be under warranty but that I would have to pay shipping (which would NOT be reimbursed) or drive to take it to the closest repair center.  </li>
            <li> The heads with the rubber disc in the center can be a bit abrasive to me.</li>
            <li> All products were as we expected.</li>
            <li> works as expected -cleans</li>
            <li> Returned - not as expected</li>
            <li> There is not even a contact number for the Fulfillment Center on the letter declining the rebate.</li>
            <li> Does everything I expected of it.</li>
            <li> has a 30 second notification (head turns on and off a few times)</li>
            <li> There really is no competition with manual and electric toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> It arrived sooner than I expected.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had these a few days</li>
            <li> i expected it&#x27;s a product that with 8,800 oscillations and 40,000 pulsations per minutes.</li>
            <li> it in to a service center for warranty claim.  </li>
            <li> Holds a charge for a few days if you forget to put it back on its dock.</li>
            <li> I use it but aim skiierd it may damage my implant  because it is to rough  </li>
            <li> I had absolutely no problems with it.  </li>
            <li> My teeth felt a lot cleaner and the tiny round head made it easier to reach areas I could not reach before.</li>
            <li> The brush is noisier than expected.  </li>
            <li> This thoroughly cleans my teeth and gum lines without being rough.  </li>
            <li> had to go back to my dentist a few weeks after buying this because I had to have a crown procedure done</li>
            <li> The quadrant timers (30 sec) coincide with my brushing habits to begin with</li>
            <li> and I had trouble reaching my back molars.</li>
            <li> It works as expected.</li>
            <li> It was a one-person toothbrush, so it&#x27;s not as though it got extraordinarily heavy use by multiple users.</li>
            <li> Has the 30 sec quadrant timer and the 2 min timer.</li>
            <li> Works well for the money spent.</li>
            <li> Using the smaller round brush head this toothbrush has helped me get my teeth cleaner than ever before.</li>
            <li> The only thing I feel is a bit redundant is the timer or the &amp;#34;hesitation&amp;#34; to tell you to move to another quadrant.  </li>
            <li> like the red light low battery indicator - my kids notice and put it on the base when it&#x27;s out (my three kids</li>
            <li> The 30 sec timer on it for each area of mouth (4 quadrants 30 sec each) is somewhat noticeable, but not much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> well about a few weeks in, i can say that i still like regular brushing over this.</li>
            <li> It worked well, but after only 2-3 years the battery had trouble keeping a charge.</li>
            <li> Works as expected.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve even converted my boyfriend, and he&#x27;s never really cared to brush (but still does).  </li>
            <li> As expected.</li>
            <li> careful withthe o-ring when you replace it.</li>
            <li> They made the on/off button harder to distinguish in the handle.</li>
            <li> They made the on/off button harder to distinguish in the handle.</li>
            <li> it could be too harsh and irritate your gum especially if they are irritated already.</li>
            <li> so rough that I threw them in the trash.</li>
            <li> absolutely no complaints</li>
            <li> and we use the precision heads which are getting harder and harder to find.</li>
            <li> All I wanted was the simple snap-on base that came with the last one I ordered -- it can&#x27;t cost more than a few pennies, but it does the trick.  </li>
            <li> And AFAIK there is absolutely no way to disable it.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t brush for a set length of time, I carefully get each side of each tooth.  </li>
            <li> the round one is easier to get to my back teeth.</li>
            <li> A really rough brush compared to the dazzle pro.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can buy a few different types of brush heads for this device.</li>
            <li> I purchased this after using a Phillips Sonicare the last few years.</li>
            <li> The battery died a few days after the 60-day money back guarantee ran out.</li>
            <li> and  as I expected.</li>
            <li> The Pluses:&lt;br /&gt;1.  Smaller recharge base makes it easier to pack for travel and more stable.&lt;br /&gt;2.  </li>
            <li> Only reason it&#x27;s not five star is I&#x27;m used to a larger brush head but slowly getting used too it.</li>
            <li> Tried charging with an old base we had (one that conveniently fit), and it worked.</li>
            <li> For me, I prefer the slow speed because my buccal mucusa and gums are extremely sensitive.</li>
            <li> toothbrush doesn&#x27;t operate any better than the Vitality and, like someone else posted, there is a gunk that accumulates at the base of the charger which I have to scrub and soak regularly.  </li>
            <li> My wife &amp; I share the base and each keep out own heads.  </li>
            <li> The charging base is really nice too.</li>
            <li> The kids all have their own head and share the base.</li>
            <li> I never had to wipe down my Sonicare toothbrush (esp after every single use) and it never left a mess on my bathroom</li>
            <li> only downsides are that the base can easily collect some toothpastey/watery grime after only a few days if you don&#x27;t dry it off after every single use, which I don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> This is a bit of a challenge, because the brush turns off by itself, so even though you leave it off the charger, once it&#x27;s worn down a bit, it will stop and turn off, even though it is not completely drained.  </li>
            <li> It does not seem to work any better than the less expensive Oral-b toothbrushes I have used in the past.  </li>
            <li> The toothbrush is adequate, has a low somewhat unpleasant pitch.  </li>
            <li> One downside is the strange little hole in the shaft of the removable brush: It fills with water/toothpaste and leaves little white pools on the counter.</li>
            <li> A bit loud, tough to hang on to when wet, would prefer a &amp;#34;beep&amp;#34; instead of the pulse after 30 sec interval, takes a long time to charge fully.</li>
            <li> only issue is you have to clean the stem and base regularly or you get a bit of grime</li>
            <li> My problem is that the small base makes the unit top heavy and likely to tip when I&#x27;m reaching for something else near it.</li>
            <li> I had my previous oral b brush for a long time, this is an improvement with added pulsations in addition to the rotations.  </li>
            <li> so bought this in advance of a complete battery failure.</li>
            <li> I find that these last about 3 years, after which time the battery holds less and less charge.</li>
            <li> handle itself is slightly grooved so that it is less likely to slip when damp.  </li>
            <li> other issue with this brush is that my dentist told me it can be harder on the gums than Sonicare.</li>
            <li> This was terrible, worked fine initially but suddenly stopped working after only around 6 months.</li>
            <li> This one should last at least that long.</li>
            <li> Heads are a bit pricy, but do last a long time, at least for me.</li>
            <li> Not happy since brush head is the main part of the brush.</li>
            <li> I have been using Oral-B electric tooth  brushes for past years and wanted one for trip, but this unit missed the functions for gentle and slow modes</li>
            <li> :  This brush will accomodate the &#x27;dual-action&#x27; heads, and once I tried those, going back to the single action was really lame.  </li>
            <li> A single On/Off button on the handle controls the brush instead of the previous two.  </li>
            <li> (I have considered the Rotadent for sometime but eventually rejected it because of the poor battery technology and high price in brushhead</li>
            <li> It does require pretty regular cleaning of the whole unit, including the charging base, but it&#x27;s a small price to pay.  </li>
            <li> The head action is clumsy and a little rough.  </li>
            <li> on the low setting, with very little noise, about a 2 on the 10 scale.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Well and truly shocked, I used a pulsating water aerator (water pik) just to see whether any more black slime remained.</li>
            <li> /&gt;the battery life on the tooth brush last for a few days.. maybe even up to a week and half</li>
            <li> My teeth may just be sensitive compared to others, but it&#x27;s not a good toothbrush for me.</li>
            <li> I was expecting the same quality I&#x27;d gotten from my past two Oral-B&#x27;s</li>
            <li> Extremely thorough cleaning.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I would have used all the bells and whistles that other brushes offered.  </li>
            <li> There is no room for other brush heads to be stored on the stand</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll have to charge it every other day.</li>
            <li> Each charge lasts about 8 days before it tells you its low and you need to recharge and you would not want to go past that because the lack of power is noticeable at that point.</li>
            <li> Sent in my photo copies, refused due to sending in copies not originals.  </li>
            <li> Compared to the other electric toothbrushes I have used, even ones by this brand, this is bulky and unruly.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried other brands</li>
            <li> No option to store other brush heads.</li>
            <li> Considered a luxuary item due to price.</li>
            <li> but other than that it gets the job done.</li>
            <li> like how the head is small and you can pinpoint on locations around your mouth, except that I feel that it doesn&#x27;t hold enough toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I have to lean over the sink in case I drool and usually stop one once or twice to spit while brushing to prevent it from dripping out of my mouth or ending up with a blue waterfall over my chin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Uses same brushes as my other Oral-B. Has a small charger and battery is replaceable.  </li>
            <li> I prefer the Oral-B to any other brand of electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> However, reading the other reviews, it sounds like others have gotten it to work.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have had a similar toothbrush in the past, but the model has been discontinued.</li>
            <li> a bargain at the price compared to the other models.</li>
            <li> quite small, which is convenient if you are short of space.</li>
            <li> Having never used an &amp;#34;electric&amp;#34; toothbrush before, it did feel weird at first</li>
            <li> I bought  two and gave the other to my partner.  </li>
            <li> If I find I do not like it, I can buy any of the other varieties they offer ....</li>
            <li> Works extremely well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small head allows me to reach the teeth farthest back in my mouth</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> but he says he likes this one because he feels it leaves his teeth cleaner than any of the other ones we&#x27;ve used before.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had several Oral B electric toothbrushes over the years, but after this one I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;ll ever buy another.  </li>
            <li> This model is small and basic, just what I need</li>
            <li> Prices vary widely:  shop!</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first.</li>
            <li> a problem I&#x27;ve never had with any other</li>
            <li> Overall, the Oral-B has done wonders for the teeth, but the excessive recharge time gets the product 4 stars, not 5.</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> It is a bit noisy as written in other reviews.</li>
            <li> Next time, I&#x27;ll get the one I usually get.</li>
            <li> I recommend this toothbrush over other brands.</li>
            <li> I like that it is lighter than other Oral-B power toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> I looked at the other models but felt this one gives me the features that I need.</li>
            <li> It gets my teeth cleaner than any other tooth brush I have ever used.</li>
            <li> It times you with hesitations to encourage you to move the spinning head to other places in your mouth to get a thorough polishing.</li>
            <li> She is not pleased with the 30 second notifications.  </li>
            <li> Only a small amount of toothpaste is needed with each brushing.</li>
            <li> No need for all the bells and whistles of other models.</li>
            <li> other thing</li>
            <li> other thing</li>
            <li> Be careful!</li>
            <li> I prefer the circular motion versus the back-and-forth method of other brushes.  </li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t come with a holder for the toothbrush, the way that all of the other OralB electric toothbrushes came.  </li>
            <li> I bought this due to name</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried them both and agree with other reviewers.</li>
            <li> I opted for this one instead 1) for the price and 2) because from reading other reviews, it seemed as if cleaning this one was a bit easier.</li>
            <li> There is a small hole below the brush that is difficult to clean and I have no idea</li>
            <li> I tried testing it on my hand and the only thing I noticed was that if I pressed hard enough to bore a hole in wood, the motor bogged down.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s very rough.</li>
            <li> I found them to be noisy and felt very rough in my mouth...sort of like an attack on my teeth and gums.  </li>
            <li> This model feels very rough on the gum.  </li>
            <li> Performance was very rough.  </li>
            <li> The new brush is worse.</li>
            <li> I got confused because the manufacturer is using one set of directions for multiple models of their toothbrushes but not being specific on the directions as to which model is in the box.</li>
            <li> The brush head was so big, I was gaging when I tired to brush in the back.</li>
            <li> My old Sonicare, Elite model not flexcare, replacement heads was twisted on similar to a cup.</li>
            <li> If you simply want an electric toothbrush and don&#x27;t want extra unnecessary features, then this is the one to get.</li>
            <li> It has a slight jittery motion that alerts you to the fact that you have spent the requisite 30 seconds on one quadrant of your mouth as recommended.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;d think flashing green means it&#x27;s finished charging and a constant green means &amp;#34;wait.</li>
            <li> The main differences between the two was that the old version had two speeds (which I never used the slower speed anyway) and a much larger base with storage compartments for additional brush heads.</li>
            <li> I have some problems with my teeth and my dentist ask me to use a smaller tooth brush to reach to all the difficult areas, special behind the lower jaw teeth.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The action on the head is weak, too--</li>
            <li> The timer also makes sure I don&#x27;t brush poorly when I&#x27;m tired and lazy.</li>
            <li> closed tight around the tooth brush.</li>
            <li> The standard 2 minute timer is broken into four 30 second quadrant units, which really breaks up the monotony of swirling a toothbrush through your mouth at random for 120 seconds.</li>
            <li> This tootbrush is rechargeable (come with the base) and very comfortable to grip.</li>
            <li> Was a little disappointed that I found a better price at BJ&#x27;s Wholesale Club after I had purchased this, but service and other items I purchased made up the difference.  </li>
            <li> I noticed a change in brushing heads was called for in anywhere from three to six months, not because the bristles wear down, but the head becomes slightly looser and it would sort of start pinching my gum or tongue a bit as my skin could get slightly caught between the loose plastic.  </li>
            <li> This works so well, my other one vibrated too much and made it uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> I feel this helps prevent damage to their enamel due to erroneous use of too much pressure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> started a few years back with the cell-type battery powered brushes, but they always tended to die on me in a few months, so about a year and a half ago, I went to Oral-B&#x27;s cheapest re-chargeable  model.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The only other complaint is the battery.</li>
            <li> I recommend this product to everyone who are brushing their teeth with the conventional brush</li>
            <li> While waiting for it to arrive had to use conventional toothbrush.</li>
            <li> The other is a small round one for a \\&quot;deep and thorough cleaning.\\</li>
            <li> I bought another Oral B toothbrush because the previous one worked well for a few years and mostly because I had recently paid their outrageous price to get a packet of replacement brushes and thus had to buy the same brand to get a handle to which they would attach.  </li>
            <li> I put toothpaste on it for one side of my mouth, and then stop and reload halfway through for the other half.</li>
            <li> are much less of a cost then any of the other electric toothbrushes I was considering.  </li>
            <li> When we got this, she thought that I&#x27;d finally learn that I was indeed brushing too hard.  </li>
            <li> I personally did not like how hard it vibrated though-</li>
            <li> If you press too hard, the brush simply stops rotating.</li>
            <li> Small brush surface could be a little larger</li>
            <li> How hard can it be to brush your teeth with a regular toothbrush?&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is very quiet and I like the feature that slows down or stops the toothbrush if you are brushing too hard..</li>
            <li> Too bad it is no longer available, as I want to buy another.</li>
            <li> only complaint I have against the Oral-B 1000 is that it takes 17 hours to recharge after using it for 8 or 9 days, but</li>
            <li> It short circuited at least once every time I used it for three weeks.</li>
            <li> Only negative is doesn&#x27;t come with travel case or cover for brush.</li>
            <li> However, I distinctly recall cutting the UPCs out and mailing them in with the rebate information.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really tell that it works...if it does it useless....</li>
            <li> The only negative is it takes a while to charge.</li>
            <li> but whatever, so not worth</li>
            <li> only complaint is that the price dropped $10 this week.&lt;br /&gt;Great product.</li>
            <li> It was recommended by my dental tech that I purchase one that was really expensive, but felt like there was something out there that would do the job at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Only complaint is that the head should have a click when attaching to the body.</li>
            <li> only negative point</li>
            <li> I have to say this is the only negative point about this product.</li>
            <li> I am a fanatic about my teeth, I go to the dentist every 6 months, floss and brush multiple times a day.</li>
            <li> This is my 4th Oral-B. Have used several models and nevr had a complaint.</li>
            <li> old one was broken after 5 years.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The brush sits on top of the base and charges wirelessly.  </li>
            <li> The product is good but the $20 rebate trick was disgusting!</li>
            <li> I love the compact base and the cleaning power of the brush.</li>
            <li> So even on short trips I was forced to bring the charger.  </li>
            <li> It came down to this one and a comparably priced/reviewed SonicCare, but this one was smaller and had a few small advantages.</li>
            <li> IMO, you can&#x27;t go wrong with an Oral B electric toothbrush, and it really comes down to choosing a model based upon the features that you want.  </li>
            <li> Also, it does not just shut off instantly after 2 min, it seems to slow down a bit.  </li>
            <li> Plus the Oral-B heads are less expensive in general, and tend to go on sale regularly to keep the long-term costs manageable.&lt;br</li>
            <li> A perk is that I find that I use LESS TOOTHPASTE with this brush than conventional toothbrush...</li>
            <li> The base is concave and ends up getting a little gunky no matter how clean I think my brush is after use, but it&#x27;s simple to clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;A run down on the Oral B 1000-&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> one upstairs and one down stairs in Maine, and we each have one in Fl</li>
            <li> The speed slows down.</li>
            <li> I like the fact that it breaks the 2 minutes down to 30 seconds per quadrant of your mouth.  </li>
            <li> I wipe down my toothbrush after every use.</li>
            <li> but the truth is I still sometimes end up with toothpaste spit down the front of me,</li>
            <li> My 10-year-old Oral-B toothbrush was failing - the battery wasn&#x27;t fully charging and the RPMs and power were down -</li>
            <li> but no need to bear down.</li>
            <li> That way you can break down the 2mins into 4 quardrants.</li>
            <li> so it won&#x27;t run down and then have to do with out it until it is recharged.  </li>
            <li> (i.e. they would fall off if I turned the brush upside down).</li>
            <li> The battery has already slowed down to the point where I have to keep the brush on he charger all the time.  </li>
            <li> just can’t go down to the store and buy a replacement.</li>
            <li> Not sure why I waited so long!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;requires minimal space in the bathroom!!</li>
            <li> I keep getting my shirts dirty because it drips right down on me.  </li>
            <li> Original brush heads are expensive, but generic versions can be found less expensive at Amazon.</li>
            <li> I also found that I don&#x27;t use the toothbrush head storage in the larger base of the Excel, so the smaller charging base of the 1000 was great.  </li>
            <li> However, I know from previous experience, that the item might have problems down the road</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t waste money on the sonic style or other gimmicks.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s where the base connects to the toothbrush and when I take off the top, the metal piece is already getting a little rusty.</li>
            <li> Sonicare is more expensive and I had to buy 2 in the past year and a half to replace broken ones.</li>
            <li> The recharger stand is just a small basic oval shape that takes up very little space.</li>
            <li> I have a few cavities and this made them slightly uncomfortable, but other than that, a high quality product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d previously used a Phillips.</li>
            <li> A lot of black slime will pop out.</li>
            <li> Died/not charging after less than a year/ 30-50 uses.</li>
            <li> I had previously used the Oral-B battery powered electric toothbrush (the $15 one that uses AA batteries).  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had previous versions of this brush which have worked well over the years..</li>
            <li> It feels...smooth and the rhythmic vibration is oddly comforting.</li>
            <li> The brush head is small enough for a small mouth.&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li> My husband ordered the Oral B Pulsonic Sonic Electric Rechargeable Power Toothbrush because it was slimmer, and he thought it would take up less space.</li>
            <li> My dentist noticed a difference since I have been using them, less plaque</li>
            <li> Using it has lowered the amount of plaque on some somewhat hidden parts of my teeth.</li>
            <li> I was previously using a battery operated brand and when this was demonstrated to me by my sister, I wanted it immediately.</li>
            <li> Compared to a previous model Oral-B toothbrush I owned, this one is like a toothbrush on steroids.</li>
            <li> I will know six months from now whether I get less cavities</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve shared in previous reviews for Oral-B electric toothbrush products,</li>
            <li> Noisier and less engineered than previous models.</li>
            <li> A replacement for my previous model which ran faithfully for about four years.</li>
            <li> This newer model is lighter to hold &amp; takes up less room.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Could have bought it for $20 less on sale at Walgreens with coupon.</li>
            <li> Previously a devout Sonicare user, my husband convinced me to try an Oral-B instead.  </li>
            <li> However, I would not recommend it for kids under 6 as I am not sure it would be small enough for their mouths.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Since I use this toothbrush I have much less inflammation of the gums</li>
            <li> product cured my slight bleeding at brushing time.</li>
            <li> Less noise and easier on my mouth.</li>
            <li> Before moving, I didn&#x27;t go to the dentist for a year &amp; a half.  </li>
            <li> Grabbed it when it was on sale here on Amazon, it was almost half of what I would have to pay at the store...</li>
            <li> Taking care of my teeth and gums is a big thing for me(I brush at least 2 times a day, floss everyday, and use mouth wash), so I don&#x27;t think it was from lack of care.</li>
            <li> You should not be brushing with a manual toothbrush anymore - this takes so much less time</li>
            <li> After using the 1000 model for couple weeks, I plan to take the previous one to my office.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s louder than my previous ultrasonic brush by Oral-B.  </li>
            <li> I fits my schedule, less time.  </li>
            <li> I know, it seems an odd gift.  </li>
            <li> They were previously using battery operated units, but they were losing their punch.  </li>
            <li> less than $25.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Had previous Oral B rechargeable electric toothbrush &amp; this one that I ordered fully met expectations.</li>
            <li> The difference:  less work, cleaner teeth.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is typical with Amazon.</li>
            <li> A slight nuisance.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s painful and should come with a speed/sensitivity option to at least give their customers a choice and a chance to be able to use it.</li>
            <li> I have been having less tartar build up since using it.</li>
            <li> Previous to this I had an Oral B electric toothbrush for 15 years.</li>
            <li> I have had two previous Oral-B battery powered tooth brushes.</li>
            <li> The charge seems to hold for about a week, and it does help me brush with less pressure.</li>
            <li> my previous brush which lasted 10 years to work.</li>
            <li> My previous Oral-B lasted 8 years, so I&#x27;ll be tickled if this one does also.</li>
            <li> I was using previously.</li>
            <li> Hoping for less time in the dental chair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, there isn&#x27;t any cover for the head like previous electric toothbrushes I&#x27;ve had.</li>
            <li> It is recommended that the brush heads be replaced every three months or when the indicators are half way faded.  </li>
            <li> Has a lot of the features from previous flagship&lt;br /&gt;model.</li>
            <li> and you find that you floss less because it cleans between the teeth so thoroughly.</li>
            <li> The design is slender and sleek with a narrow charging base that takes up less space on a bathroom counter top.</li>
            <li> Still, I used these products faithfully for the 20 years I had no professional dental care, and I had hardly any tartar build-up when I got my teeth cleaned, whereas previously, I did not use the products, and went to the dentist every 6 months</li>
            <li> Still, I used these products faithfully for the 20 years I had no professional dental care, and I had hardly any tartar build-up when I got my teeth cleaned, whereas previously, I did not use the products, and went to the dentist every 6 months</li>
            <li> Very small charger base, easy to hold handle, takes the standard Oral-B head series.</li>
            <li> This is the fourth electric brush I have owned and it is hard to find anything wrong with it so far.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Having said all that, this toothbrush is not an excuse for not flossing and brushing at least once per day.</li>
            <li> Not cool.</li>
            <li> They both failed after about a year, but maybe that&#x27;s normal.  </li>
            <li> it needs a long recharging once a week, at least.  </li>
            <li> Minor complaint,</li>
            <li> The machine stops if it hits a little friction in my mouth (they previous one never did that).  </li>
            <li> The brush part could be a little softer in my opinion, but its really a minor complaint.</li>
            <li> I admit that now I&#x27;m usually too lazy to brush for as long as I should, so I ignore the pauses.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love how small the base is</li>
            <li> so it is not surprising that the battery was completely dead by the end, but this toothbrush seems to last a lot longer.</li>
            <li> The replacement tips are expensive, but they last a long time.</li>
            <li> charging base is also easy to use.  </li>
            <li> so it feels like you can easily tip it over or knock your brush off the base.</li>
            <li> So about every other week I have to clean this crap</li>
            <li> The only downside is the name brand replacement heads are ridiculously expensive and the off-brand ones I found at Target that are supposed to work with it are a very tight and awkward fit.</li>
            <li> In addition, I&#x27;ve notice a little bit of gum re-growth in a spot where it had receded.</li>
            <li> As a result, the brush unit itself turned a little when in use, not just the brush wheel.  </li>
            <li> I can see the difference in the little specks of food that get loosened from my teeth.</li>
            <li> brush han little to no</li>
            <li> but it takes up little room on the bathroom counter.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My dental hygienist says there is little for her to do when I show up every 6 months for a checkup.</li>
            <li> I took off one star because this device is a little noisy but</li>
            <li> But, with a little ingenuity the LED can be covered with material to reduce the brightness level.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t like the small brush heads other sizes are compatible with this.</li>
            <li> I bought this toothbrush after doing a little bit of research into Oral-B and Sonicare.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush, if used twice a week, allows a person to do little or no flossing.</li>
            <li> I am giving it only 3 stars because the one I received is missing the brush storage base - which is the reason I bought it in the first place.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just a compact little stand.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is a little pricey</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended this brush due to past history of gingivitis which has not since using it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have been using this a little over a year.  </li>
            <li> My dental hygienist recommended my getting an electric brush due to excessive tartar build-up between my 6 month cleanings.</li>
            <li> Things I didn&#x27;t like:&lt;br /&gt;Short battery life with little warning before dying.&lt;br /&gt;Poorly designed stand.&lt;br /&gt;Expensive brush heads.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li> The battery seems to die a little during brushing.</li>
            <li> I have used a little bracket and some Velcro loop&amp;hook material and</li>
            <li> it would charge a little faster.</li>
            <li> The only negative is that it takes forever to fully charge!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had two other Oral-B Electric toothbrushes in the past.</li>
            <li> /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;Handle is a little narrow&lt;br /&gt;Base</li>
            <li> I am just nitpicking little details I wish could be improved on.</li>
            <li> could be a little slimmer with today&#x27;s battery tech, but you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> I found it doesn&#x27;t reduce the need to floss even a little bit.</li>
            <li> When I was little I used to have an electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Although my teeth feel really, really clean when I&#x27;m done, I am disappointed in how it feels while brushing, it&#x27;s like a jackhammer in my mouth.</li>
            <li> I am disappointed with the brush head size and the difficulty on keeping the unit clean.  </li>
            <li> The nickel-cadmium rechargeable batteries were still working fine, but the charging base got damaged during a move.  </li>
            <li> the previous Oral-B I had lasted, and the flashing green light while it is charging is beyond annoying.</li>
            <li> but it was a little too harsh on some of my gum tissues</li>
            <li> Low quality appearance and feel; brush head is small and hard as a rock; the vibration is weak and actually sputters--even when not touching the teeth.  </li>
            <li> The stress of a tough year is starting to get to me.</li>
            <li> The Sonicare cleaning action was fine; it was the unsanitary design, the really nasty smell, the need to take the brush assembly apart at least every week and figure out a way to swab out all that gunk under it without corroding the metal parts that was so off-putting.  </li>
            <li> So, if i brush my teeth before going to bed, the annoying green light in the adjoining bathroom flashes on and off onto my bedroom wall until the mechanism is fully charged again.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the picture clearly shows that it comes with the stand/brush head case.</li>
            <li> /&gt;What&#x27;s even worse, because I waited until I actually needed it</li>
            <li> Not too expensive, but it still offers all the results of top-tier brushes.</li>
            <li> Just wish it came with a few accessories like a travel case and a brush holder.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, replacement is necessary after several years b/c the battery loses its ability to hold charge.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s missing</li>
            <li> I had a Sonicare, but the vibration level made it a chore to use, so I didn&#x27;t use it after a few months.</li>
            <li> The base itself is smaller, barely bigger than the toothbrush handle itself, and the handle is smaller as well.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Spinal cord injury, trouble with my grip.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve been burned twice by fake Rebate offers.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for a few months and for the money you cannot beat the value.  </li>
            <li> for a few years.  </li>
            <li> Coz I&#x27;ve used electronic brushes before and this one is simply not comfortable to use.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After about a week of use I found myself really missing the Sonicare technology.</li>
            <li> /handle part with you for a few days of travel</li>
            <li> This is truly a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I was a heavy soda drinker</li>
            <li> I decided on an Oral-b when my Sonicare started to give me trouble after 9 faithful years of use.</li>
            <li> The Oral-b will blink green when charging and stop blinking when fully charged.</li>
            <li> The Oral-b will blink green when charging and stop blinking when fully charged.</li>
            <li> we will see in few month.</li>
            <li> After a few days, however, I noticed a layer of my front teeth was scraped off.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve owned it for a few weeks now</li>
            <li> than have it die on you after not charging for a few days.</li>
            <li> I use it for a few weeks without needing to recharge it.</li>
            <li> I got one of these for me a few years ago and just got another one for my wife.  </li>
            <li> They just cheat me and waste my time and money.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It gets messy</li>
            <li> After years of scrubbing my teeth with dollar store electric tooth brushes, my dentist recommended me to get a &amp;#34;professional level&amp;#34; toothbrush because of poor brushing habits and extremely red gums (and I am a non-smoker).</li>
            <li> Just started using it a few days ago.</li>
            <li> Have been using it for a few months now and it lasts days without charging.</li>
            <li> This replaces a dead Cybersonic 2 that I had for 12 years.</li>
            <li> Well, I bought one of these in Dec 2012, and as of this month, June 2015, it&#x27;s dead, no ability to charge.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Heads are not cheap..</li>
            <li> My husband and I use them everyday.</li>
            <li> Toothbrush lasts a few days of brushing in between charging.</li>
            <li> and I like the low profile base which we only use when the battery shows low.</li>
            <li> I dropped it a few times already.</li>
            <li> This brush has few of the bells and whistles of pricier models, but does an efficient job.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s frustrating to have to constantly charge the toothbrush.</li>
            <li> It took a few times to get used to the vibration in my mouth</li>
            <li> I also use a pick/scaler a few times a week.</li>
            <li> Nothing wrong with it so far.</li>
            <li> I used it everyday, 2 times a day.  </li>
            <li> A couple of days ago, the toothbrush stopped altogether, presumably the battery is dead.  </li>
            <li> Have been using this for a few months.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had quite a few electric toothbrushes for years.  </li>
            <li> After calling the help line I was told sometimes this happens so if yours doesn&#x27;t go off after a few hours don&#x27;t be alarmed.</li>
            <li> flashing green is kinda</li>
            <li> so unfortunately I don&#x27;t have anything to compare it to, but I will say that I am pleasantly surprised by how well it works.</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t have to charge it everyday.</li>
            <li> We got this to replace our old Braun Sonicare which was difficult to keep clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Don’t waste your money.  </li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t think I would like the round brushes</li>
            <li> This toothbrush replaced a battery one where the head had broken after only a few weeks.</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;pulsating&amp;#34; mentioned oh-so-briefly in the product description is actually a very unpleasant and extremely strong jackhammer</li>
            <li> Furthermore the base has a smaller male part and a wider flat part which makes it easier to clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had a problem brushing less than two minutes, usually I do three, so</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too hard on my gums as other toothbrushes have been.  </li>
            <li> You have to clean the base holder everyday</li>
            <li> Loses 1 star due to this.</li>
            <li> I have used hard bristle toothbrushes in the past, but this one seemed much harder.</li>
            <li> Brush heads were stiff.</li>
            <li> I wanted just a plain electric toothbrush for a resonable price.</li>
            <li> No good.the mother is not strong.</li>
            <li> If the charger and base of the toothbrush were clean (ie, side charging port) then I would give it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> Would have rated 5 stars but find that the power button is not easy to locate because of the handle design.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spent so much extra money on extra crap and extra time to make up for the poor job</li>
            <li> I have owned several different brands of powered toothbrushes, some VERY expensive.  </li>
            <li> As for other reviews that state they have mechanical problems with electric toothbrushes, if you only spend $40 for this model and get 6-12 months out of it before it breaks, you&#x27;ll be a lot less frustrated than you would if you spent $120.</li>
            <li> but you&#x27;ve never seen anything like the mess i get in when using it - the mirror, too!</li>
            <li> actually just tried it out right now and it makes brushing alot less boring.</li>
            <li> Hate the price but lifespan of a new Oral-B toothbrush head is several months.</li>
            <li> This brush is a bit of a different experience for me, having used a much less expensive electronic brush system before.</li>
            <li> Because it&#x27;s slimmer, I find it much easier to navigate around my mouth and keep the base dry as well.</li>
            <li> and this unit slows down to tell me when I am pushing too hard.</li>
            <li> Will stop if you press down to hard.  </li>
            <li> There are no fancy settings, although this one will shut down if you press to hard against your teeth.</li>
            <li> The first one had a bad battery from the start, and I never got around to replacing it.</li>
            <li> I was shocked at the quality of this toothbrush because it was not expensive.  </li>
            <li> I think a lot has to do with the small round brush head.</li>
            <li> extras you pay for are things like an external timer that you can watch to see if your brushing long enough (BTW the 1000 model has timing intervals that are simply momentary pauses every 30 seconds), or Battery level indicators (I keep mine on the charging base all of the time, so the Level indicator would be useless to me), or a flashing LED if you are pressing to hard.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Her dentist recommended a power brush with the small round head.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-instructions are vague and in broken English, still can&#x27;t figure out how to toggle between the different speed settings--or there just isn&#x27;t any difference.</li>
            <li> I had to come up with a complaint, it would be that the charging base is a little insubstantial resulting in it being hard to place exactly where you want it on a flat surface --  </li>
            <li> We had the Oral B Vitality before and it lasted almost 7 years but just began to slow down</li>
            <li> I know you&#x27;re not supposed to press down with toothbrushes but the motor just about stops with the least rotation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Only complaint--on/off switch is a little difficult to find by touch.</li>
            <li> As with past purchases of Braun Electric Toothbrushes (previous version lasted for 10 years!)</li>
            <li> The ORAL-B is way less expensive than the Sonic and equal (if not better) in quality.</li>
            <li> Not very effective.</li>
            <li> Dazzlepro Advanced Sonic Toothbrush with UV Base]] gave up the ghost I found that manual brushing was not nearly as effective, so I purchased this model.</li>
            <li> This is false advertisement and should at least state only 1 item per rebate in the details of the cost!!!!</li>
            <li> As a bonus, the base is way smaller than the old one I had.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s got a lot of power behind it, and the charging base, which is kid-safe, is really innovative.  </li>
            <li> Small brush head lets you get to hard to reach corners of your mouth, but the brush itself seems a little stiff.</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush but I am very disappointed that I bought it in June of 2015 and it has already broke.  </li>
            <li> Electric Toothbrush helps to rectify that; it offers you champaign dental hygiene on something nearer to a beer budget; replacing the manual toothbrush&#x27;s large, dense pack of bristles with a small, circular head that is better suited to accessing each tooth&#x27;s surface and removing food particles at the gumline where the worst of the nasty, irreversible damage</li>
            <li> The motor just gets bent a little when you push really hard so it changes tone.</li>
            <li> power button also was a little small and hard.</li>
            <li> I wish they could&#x27;ve made it a little flatter, or at least recessed that area where the part with the bristles attaches to it.</li>
            <li> I wish they could&#x27;ve made it a little flatter, or at least recessed that area where the part with the bristles attaches to it.</li>
            <li> I ended up giving this one away, because it was a little slow for my liking.</li>
            <li> The Brush Has Very Little Power When Pressure Is Applied</li>
            <li> Compact size takes very little space on the counter or storage area which helps.</li>
            <li> My dentist always tell me how I have very little plaque...</li>
            <li> I have really bad overcrowding, so even though I brushed my teeth like I was supposed to, I still got really bad gingivitis and cavities because my standard toothbrush was unable to reach certain places, and I also brushed way too hard.</li>
            <li> and I really didn&#x27;t like flossing because it was painful.</li>
            <li> It sounds like a small airplane is landing in the bathroom when I use it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> have been a user of electric toothbrushes for the past 18 years.  </li>
            <li> Not sure if it&#x27;s supposed to feel this way.  </li>
            <li> This is the past toothbrush I have ever owned.</li>
            <li> drawbacks are: the brush is supposed to stop pulsating when you pressed too hard, but sometime you push hard and it doesn&#x27;t stop and some other time you don&#x27;t push too hard and</li>
            <li> Not much more to say than</li>
            <li> SOME EIGHT WEEKS HAVE PAST</li>
            <li> It makes me brush my teeth, because I can be lazy doing it!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> thing to note is it does let you know when 30 seconds has past</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if the timing mechanism is off on mine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> There is a small glitch to it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using electric tooth brushes for the past 20 years.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> THIS one, however, fails the battery test big time.</li>
            <li> because the one I received is missing the brush storage base - which is the reason I bought it in the first place.  </li>
            <li> I have a severe gag reflex &amp; prefer the small brush heads.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I found it for $30 at Walmart later.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how to explain it, but I discontinued using it for fear it was hurting my teeth.</li>
            <li> you should also know that, because it rotates, it can fling small toothpaste globs, so i don&#x27;t recommend brushing with this just before you head out for work in the suit and tie.</li>
            <li> Not sure if there is just a flaw in the one I received as it skips on and off as I use it?????</li>
            <li> I use a small capped container.  </li>
            <li> I hate brushing my teeth, but this thing makes it fun.  </li>
            <li> If you used this everyday I doubt you would ever get cavities!</li>
            <li> We discovered last night that it was not the toothbrush that failed, but the charger.</li>
            <li> The extra battery allows it to be taken on short trips of a few days without bringing the base.</li>
            <li> We have used them in the past and this was a replacement.</li>
            <li> I like it since I&#x27;m too lazy brushing the teeth</li>
            <li> Otherwise you&#x27;re likely to find it uncomfortable and have bleeding gums.</li>
            <li> The charger is small and unobtrusive.</li>
            <li> No more need to count myself to know when to switch to another area of the mouth.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t hurt on the gums and is small enough to reach difficult areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure now.&lt;br</li>
            <li> No more wasting money on batteries as it&#x27;s rechargeable, and the battery lasts about one week before it needs to be charged.</li>
            <li> In the past.</li>
            <li> This  toothbrush takes up a small area .  </li>
            <li> Not sure if it applies to the Amazon purchase as the rebate says it&#x27;s for a \\&quot;store purchase\\&quot;, but we shall see.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A small signal every 30 seconds reminds you to change quadrants.</li>
            <li> Had to use usual brush for three weeks and had  a feeling of &amp;#34;dirty teeth&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I will NEVER use an ordinary toothbrush again.  </li>
            <li> even the charging station is small</li>
            <li> I like the small head.  </li>
            <li> Not sure why,</li>
            <li> I usually used the Spinbrush from oral b</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually have problems with my teeth or gums and dentist</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s weird and gross.  </li>
            <li> Toothbrush tends to stutter when in use (loses power every few seconds).&lt;br /&gt;Disappointing but couldn&#x27;t be bothered to return product.</li>
            <li> The small head allows for precision brushing and avoiding the gums.  </li>
            <li> I use it everyday and it works!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sad to send it back</li>
            <li> Like the small charger.</li>
            <li> Althought the brush head is small</li>
            <li> Works as well as all the Oral-B toothbrushes I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
            <li> One is about the size of a small hand toothbrush which is touted for cleaning and whitening.  </li>
            <li> had I not read the instructions, and I am not sure I can differentiate between the three, but regardless it works well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Oral-B rechargeable electric toothbrushes for the past 20+ years.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Power button is a bit small</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I would pay retail for this</li>
            <li> It is easier to get inside my front teeth with the small rotating head.</li>
            <li> The charger is small and saves counter space.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t mean a few hours</li>
            <li> It appears from wading through the reviews that the cheaper ones are likely to be fakes, not true Oral-B parts, and that they may soon fall apart, with some risk of cutting the mouth.  </li>
            <li> It appears from wading through the reviews that the cheaper ones are likely to be fakes, not true Oral-B parts, and that they may soon fall apart, with some risk of cutting the mouth.  </li>
            <li> What is helpful is to purchase their power tip brush which is very narrow and allows you to target in between the teeth.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately these spinning bristle models don&#x27;t really do it for me and if you&#x27;re used to sonic technology you will likely be as disappointed as I was.</li>
            <li> but wow I was completely wrong!</li>
            <li> Both my wife and I find the button difficult to find by feel due to its small size, and a bit hard to press down.  </li>
            <li> admit after the bad buckle debacle I chatted with my dentist (new and improved, dentist 2.0!)</li>
            <li> charging base is tiny and simple.  </li>
            <li> The only thing I don&#x27;t like is liquid settles into the base of the holder and looks gross.</li>
            <li> , this thing has poor design in that it gets so dirty so fast.</li>
            <li> Works but not great is gust a small round brush the is a little slow.</li>
            <li> Just not very good.  </li>
            <li> and I find that I brush my teeth a lot longer than with a manual brush ( which either hurts my gums if I brush too hard or I end up hitting them while trying to maneuver it in the mouth) and I like the small size</li>
            <li> It warns me when I&#x27;m brushing too hard by stopping the toothbrush and giving 3 small &amp;#34;buzzing&amp;#34; type sounds, and it takes the &amp;#34;sensitive&amp;#34; brush heads.</li>
            <li> so not suitable for travel to countries with 220V power.</li>
            <li> There is NO brush head storage base as the picture shows.&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, the toothbrush works pretty well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been puckered up so tight for so long, I&#x27;m afraid my puckerer may have frozen that</li>
            <li> /&gt;After one and a half years, the battery seems to be getting worse over time.</li>
            <li> Small base is very compact and unobtrusive on the counter.</li>
            <li> charger base gets a little gross looking after a couple days from water running down on it</li>
            <li> well, the need to floss is lessened due to the pulsating head that breaks up stuck food particles (major plus since I hate</li>
            <li> My previous Barun Oral-B lasted about 9.7 years and only started to go bad after maybe 9.3, I guess.  </li>
            <li> It works just fine when it&#x27;s been charged up, stupid mistake on my part!!</li>
            <li> Also, my dentist is always telling me not to brush too hard</li>
            <li> In the product description it says &amp;#34;The pressure sensor lights up if you brush too hard to prevent harmful over-brushing,&amp;#34; but that is not the case for the Oral-B PRO 1000.</li>
            <li> Still, for the money, this is hard to beat.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush also \\&quot;talks back\\&quot; when you push too hard.  </li>
            <li> you brush too hard the pulsations stop.</li>
            <li> Also it states it has an auto stop if you push too hard...</li>
            <li> although I think we all know if we are brushing too hard</li>
            <li> hard.  </li>
            <li> I used sonic one before and its hard to get used to.  </li>
            <li> Hard for me to believe, though -- it is RELENTLESS.</li>
            <li> It even has pressure sensative sensors that stops the brush when you brush too hard.</li>
            <li> It is not from brushing too hard.</li>
            <li> And if he brushes too hard, it quits spinning.  </li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll also receive additional momentary stutters if you&#x27;re pressing to hard on your teeth.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Bought this because I brush too hard and have receding gum lines.</li>
            <li> I like the mechanism that makes you not to press too hard, so it does not damage the gums.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> It has the quadrant timer and if you brush too hard it stops to let you know.</li>
            <li> (maybe I am pressing too hard</li>
            <li> All I cared was that this brush was made in Germany, and price is hard to beat.</li>
            <li> Button is hard to press on.  </li>
            <li> It is hard to turn on and off.</li>
            <li> This is one toothbrush that works hard to help foul mouths everywhere.</li>
            <li> I also scaled my teeth after and it was hardly any plaque to be found.</li>
            <li> People press too hard when brushing.&lt;br /&gt;5)</li>
            <li> I was experiencing difficulty getting into hard to reach places.</li>
            <li> The bristles are dangerously hard.  </li>
            <li> Hard on the gums.  </li>
            <li> I do not irritate my gums by brushing too hard anymore</li>
            <li> consistency is hard to achieve.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s meant to stop pulsating if brushing too hard?</li>
            <li> /&gt;You see we are too stupid and need a \\&quot;SMART SENSE\\</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, for some reason Amazon has the brush pictured with a large base.</li>
            <li> The reminder pause that occurs every 30 seconds is a little irritating.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s too late to return it.</li>
            <li> Complained to both Amazon and the shipping company with no response at all from either.  </li>
            <li> That aspect really sucks.</li>
            <li> The unit holds a charge for at least a week when I travel, so I dont even take the charger along.</li>
            <li> dsen&#x27;t brush, it sucks.</li>
            <li> However, it turned out to have a larger footprint because its charging base is so wide (</li>
            <li> Nothing wrong with the product, but be careful with rebate offer.</li>
            <li> The company sucks.  </li>
            <li> However, it seems it can lasts for at least two weeks if fully charged.</li>
            <li> nothing negative to say about this tooth brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I brush at least 4-5 minutes.</li>
            <li> This sucker is like going to the dentist.  </li>
            <li> The charging stand absolutely sucks for my needs.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Another $8 to send this piece of crap back to the service center.  </li>
            <li> The female charge socket of the brush handle was quite scuffed and dirty, suggesting it had been on an off of a charging unit quite a bit, like maybe at someone else&#x27;s house.  </li>
            <li> Keeps a charge for at least 5 days.</li>
            <li> German-made, so that means it has some quality at least.</li>
            <li> My husband has never liked any electric toothbrush before</li>
            <li> At the urging of the professionals, acquired the Oral-B and have reduced the staining by at least 90%.  </li>
            <li> I feel it should have lasted at least a year.  </li>
            <li> Did Braun get feedback that indicated to them that having a place to actually store the brush heads was inconvenient to customers?  </li>
            <li> They lasted 4 years, then we bought the cheaper model and it sucks.</li>
            <li> I complained and got another one.</li>
            <li> Sadly, Oral B neglected to put this minimal amount of effort in.</li>
            <li> By the time everything was said and done my teeth felt like I had just left the dentist (without the awkward hands in the mouth conversation).  </li>
            <li> but I brush at least 4 minutes twice a day.</li>
            <li> Battery charge lasts at least a week; doing one brushing a day.</li>
            <li> Who would ever buy this, knowing that it was expected to fail in 3-5 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Stays charged for at least a week.  </li>
            <li> confusing-</li>
            <li> The thing that sucks is that I’m in Afghanistan</li>
            <li> really (I swear), unless you count its sensor as annoying (the toothbrush stops when you&#x27;re going too</li>
            <li> Slow motion.  </li>
            <li> I also like the slim, lightweight handle and very compact charging base.  </li>
            <li> I was forced to buy this when Interplak stropped making their rotating toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> However, I cannot get past the gross gunk that develops on the base every single day!!!!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this does not work on my brush - and given the experience of other reviewers -</li>
            <li> Watch out for fake \\&quot;Oral B\\&quot; replacement heads that aren&#x27;t made by Oral B -- as reported in other reviews here.</li>
            <li> I find the brush ends too sharp and uncomfortable to use for gum massaging.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I mean who cares about that?  </li>
            <li> no more cavities!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t mean to imply anything....</li>
            <li> Once I began using an Oral-B, no more plaque problem!  </li>
            <li> The base also gets dirty and has to constantly be cleaned.&lt;br /&gt;*It takes a long time to charge and found it lasted me less than a week once fully charged.</li>
            <li> Very small quanitiy of water which you use up almost immediately</li>
            <li> I like that the charging stand has a very small foot print</li>
            <li> worst part is that the sonicare version in this price range is the full power sonicare brush without the bells and whistles.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I’m very sorry that your toothbrush is no longer working properly.</li>
            <li> But expensive gadgets and doodads would just angry my blood up further, so I&#x27;m seeking Samadhi on a shoestring</li>
            <li> Frustrated that Amazon doesn&#x27;t at least provide a way confirm contact for warranty back up.  </li>
            <li> I bought this to replace a less expensive Oral-B electric toothbrush that someone accidentally broke.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush was quite a bit less expensive than the sonic one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended.</li>
            <li> First and foremost, the Oral-B brush is a solid piece, not the contraption Sonicare sells that allows stinky mold and bacteria to proliferate at the brush base and beneath the cone where it screws into the base.  </li>
            <li> This can make it a little difficult turning the toothbrush on and off.</li>
            <li> Nitpicking, but it is a little annoying.&lt;br /&gt;The base is little narrow</li>
            <li> I was afraid that it was gonna knock my teeth loose!</li>
            <li> Finally got in for the super-duper cleaning I had been putting off for a year and it wasn&#x27;t so bad at all.</li>
            <li> This is no good, do not purchase this product.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s probably not a fair comparison.  </li>
            <li> charging base is by far the smallest I&#x27;ve seen.  </li>
            <li> Now I can get all those hard to reach areas without gagging!  </li>
            <li> It also warns you if you are pressing too hard!</li>
            <li> Nothing major, but find it annoying at times.</li>
            <li> Disappointed that it only come with 1 brush head though.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li> Weak motor in the unit.  </li>
            <li> I had purchased a different brand and was totally disappointed.  </li>
            <li> So when you are brushing your teeth the plastic center of the toothbrush head is always hitting your teeth and gums and it is very uncomfortable feeling.  </li>
            <li> I am terribly disappointed; this product was purchased by me prior to leaving for our destination wedding and malfunctioned while we were away.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried pressing very hard on my teeth and nothing happens.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s inconvenient, but otherwise I feel like half my mouth gets jipped on the toothpaste and doesn&#x27;t get as clean.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I got this after a particularly unpleasant cleaning at the dentist due to lots of plaque buildup.</li>
            <li> I was very unhappy as this is a present for someone.</li>
            <li> Very disappointing - it is LOUDER than the cheaper Vitality model, pinches my lip in a gap that&#x27;s designed into it, and instead of signaling when you&#x27;ve been brushing for a total of 2 minutes, it signals every 30 seconds to time the brushing of each quadrant of your mouth.</li>
            <li> It is very slow to start.  </li>
            <li> Just cutting the soda &amp; sweets down helped a lot to!</li>
            <li> Just cutting the soda &amp; sweets down helped a lot to!</li>
            <li> Keep it simple stupid.</li>
            <li> And for the confused users out there, the pressure sensor does not turn the brush off.  </li>
            <li> Total crap.</li>
            <li> Based upon your preferences, you might decide that a model with multiple speeds or a base with storage fits your needs</li>
            <li> It gets the job done without a boatload of unnecessary bluetooth bells and whistles.</li>
            <li> I both this least expensive version</li>
            <li> He always tired to get me to come in for a cleaning every 3 months instead of every 6 months.</li>
            <li> Can be annoying for the middle of the night bathroom visits</li>
            <li> but the base is smaller.  </li>
            <li> The only annoying aspect for me is the timer that alerts you to change quadrants after 30 seconds.</li>
            <li> I believe that&#x27;s the base that actually comes with the Precision 3000 instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over</li>
            <li> I feel this product was deficient</li>
            <li> But alas, it eventually started to feel like it was losing power.  </li>
            <li> I gather the battery power on these things is not great</li>
            <li> but it can&#x27;t be a lot worse than this one...</li>
            <li> Bought one for myself after growing tired of Spin Brush battery life issues.&lt;br /&gt;3</li>
            <li> Also, water gets trapped in the head and stinks unless you wash it.</li>
            <li> I like the smaller base</li>
            <li> four days later, their solution was a link for me to buy a $13 toothbrush head holder that from the picture is not attached to the base.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a happy camper.</li>
            <li> There is a battery indicator, but it is unnecessary--</li>
            <li> The Sonicare will blink green when charging and stay green when fully charged until removed from the charging base.</li>
            <li> The Sonicare will blink green when charging and stay green when fully charged until removed from the charging base.</li>
            <li> This is false.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This isn&#x27;t a bad brush, but it has about half the power of the spendier units.</li>
            <li> It does a thorough job of cleaning and even gives very subtle time reminders to keep you on track (vibrates every 30 seconds so that you know to change quadrants, and then vibrates for a longer period after two minutes of brushing).</li>
            <li> Obviously a bad cell, charger, or charging circuit, or a little of all three.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Used this product for a few months then the switch went bad.  </li>
            <li> The picture on Amazon&#x27;s web site shows the unit with a storage base, but I only got the round charging base.</li>
            <li> The picture on Amazon&#x27;s web site shows the unit with a storage base, but I only got the round charging base.</li>
            <li> This new version does the job, but it&#x27;s louder and the charging base can topple over with bad cable management.  </li>
            <li> Have not used it in months, very frustrated with the short longeivity with the premium price tag.</li>
            <li> I find it unnecessary and a little annoying.</li>
            <li> Dumb!</li>
            <li> Disappointed that the picture did not accurately represent the product I was getting.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The one annoyance is that the internals of the toothbrush drain down, which creates a gunky toothpastey sludge at the base of the charger.  </li>
            <li> You may find that not keeping it on the charging base and just charging it when it runs down may provide</li>
            <li> base uses little space.</li>
            <li> I was wrong.  </li>
            <li> However, the brushes do see to wear faster and why the heck does it have to be so expensive to replace?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had Oral-B electric toothbrushes for years that take replaceable batteries, but the battery cover is too difficult to remove/replace and eventually cracks.</li>
            <li> As I was unable to locate another \\&quot;Braun\\</li>
            <li> Replacement heads are not overly expensive</li>
            <li> I tried to use that brand, but could never get used to the uncomfortable sensation it created in my mouth and gums, so I went with the Braun Oral-B.  </li>
            <li> Switches failed or batteries wore out - requiring them to purchase expensive replacements while my trusty Braun kept reliably plugging along.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m skeptical as to the performance of Sonicare&#x27;s vibrating head vs. a scrubbing head like the Oral-B..</li>
            <li> I would NOT recommend buying this brush as the quality is extremely POOR!</li>
            <li> Works well but the pulsing (i.e. it turns off for a split second every 30 seconds) drives me insane.</li>
            <li> It is not that expensive and there is a $20 mail in rebate till Christmas</li>
            <li> Expensive</li>
            <li> I was sorry</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong</li>
            <li> The replacement brushes also get expensive.  </li>
            <li> so it felt a bit weird when i started using an electronic one...but</li>
            <li> I figured wrong....</li>
            <li> Although quite expensive it will pay out over time saving dentist bills.</li>
            <li> What went wrong?  </li>
            <li> I will update this post if anything goes wrong.</li>
            <li> and I am angry because there is no recourse.  </li>
            <li> But that is just me, my boyfriend thinks it is a silly concern.</li>
            <li> I am sorry I did not return it .</li>
            <li> knocked a star off because waste accumulates on the base for both my daughter and I.</li>
            <li> I know it sounds silly</li>
            <li> It is expensive and also somewhat difficult to replace the battery</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> and she was unable to turn it on at all.</li>
            <li> 1 speed and is a bit difficult to shut off.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a weird signal as I was expecting a beep</li>
            <li> (weird huh).</li>
            <li> Electric toothbrushes are usually so expensive and the refills are about $8-10 each.  </li>
            <li> The brush heads are on the expensive side</li>
            <li> After 3 months of use this tooth bush has started to fail to hold a charge and is none usable.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately didn&#x27;t keep the box or documents which came with it.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s the wrong way.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to throw away this piece of junk and stop doing all of this extra crap!</li>
            <li> unfortunately I can&#x27;t figure out how to change the heads.</li>
            <li> While it might be difficult to avoid all Proctor and Gamble products, I will avoid Oral B products from now on, just as I avoid medicines from Abbott Pharmaceuticals after they screwed me over on a rebate for a blood glucose monitor.</li>
            <li> Never go wrong with Braun.</li>
            <li> Sadly I have had this one since December and it is junk.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s a weird uncomfortable feeling.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t worry, nothing&#x27;s wrong.</li>
            <li> He is very tough on things.  </li>
            <li> It is a tad unstudy on it&#x27;s small base....</li>
            <li> do like the small, compact base.  </li>
            <li> No more crud collection on the base and the bottom of the toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Maybe some people like the small footprint of the base.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just a toothbrush on a small base.</li>
            <li> how BULKY and awkward the handle was....like a joystick!&lt;br /&gt;(2)</li>
            <li> it has been a disappointment.</li>
            <li> It vibrates like crazy, takes some getting used to, no beeping every 30 seconds just on/off.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t apply any pressure to your teeth without this thing cutting off.  </li>
            <li> For me, it felt awkward cleaning the lingual surface of the mandibular anterior teeth with the shape of the brush on the Sonicare.  </li>
            <li> Awkward.</li>
            <li> Awkward.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product to replace another electric toothbrush I was using that I was unhappy with.</li>
            <li> /&gt;*It gets really dirty.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned a lot of electric toothbrushes and this one is dangerous.</li>
            <li> Any drips will collect on the open base rather than inside the toothbrush holder like the Philips, which was so disgusting it eventually prompted me to discard it.  </li>
            <li> and you are afraid to take it out while running</li>
            <li> and you are afraid to take it out while running</li>
            <li> When you put in your mouth it goes crazy</li>
            <li> I hated it and vowed to never own one again.</li>
            <li> It also came with no cover for the brush and that is disappointing.</li>
            <li> It is an annoying and unnecessary feature.  </li>
            <li> Not happy that what is pictured is not what I got....where is the base?</li>
            <li> This is unnecessary, and since I have a community bathroom and keep the toothbrush in my room, quite annoying.</li>
            <li> But, the base is poorly designed.</li>
            <li> I find the hesitation to be a bit annoying and unnecessary, but I guess that feature is aimed at kids.  </li>
            <li> The product works well, but I was disappointed that a base to hold at least 2 brushes was not included.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not fond on how expensive the toothbrush head replacements are - yikes!)</li>
            <li> The one this one replaced lasted 12 years before the battery failed to hold a charge!</li>
            <li> WRONG AGAIN!</li>
            <li> Will update if anything goes wrong!</li>
            <li> I bought this electric tooth brush for my wife and I was very skeptical about her acceptance after some unpleasant experience with another brand.</li>
            <li> My Sonicare toothbrushes kept breaking, and are very expensive.  </li>
            <li> --this toothbrush makes it almost impossible to keep from drooling all over.</li>
            <li> impossible to change the brushl  </li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve noticed a decrease in bad morning breath too when using this brush.  </li>
            <li> Too bad this does not come with a brush-head cover as this would&#x27;ve earned a five star rating.</li>
            <li> That led to a bad case of gingivitis, which he wanted to fix.</li>
            <li> We just got a bad one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Another bad battery cell?  </li>
            <li> Then I got this bad boy</li>
            <li> My dental hygienist noticed the improvement in plaque reduction and the built in timer helps to guide your brushing so that you don&#x27;t fluke yourself into bad teeth.</li>
            <li> poorly made and the customer service is horrible and unresponsive.</li>
            <li> I was shocked.</li>
            <li> I felt like I was going to be sick when I used the Sonicare toothbrush</li>
            <li> and because I&#x27;m sick of cavities.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I thought I would give an electric toothbrush a try and after reading the reviews I picked this one and have not been disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed.</li>
            <li> was totally disappointed  </li>
            <li> ran out of charge without warning :-(  </li>
            <li> DISAPPOINTING!</li>
            <li> Buy it, you wont be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I leave with painful, bloody gums.</li>
            <li> I always thought it was stupid to buy a tooth brush over $5 that you manually use</li>
            <li> She has me using a stupid water pic.</li>
            <li> No longer the annoying beeping when recharge is needed, just blinking.&lt;br /&gt;4</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s quite annoying.</li>
            <li> wife uses the Sonicare vibrating toothbrush, which I hate..</li>
            <li> When it pulses 5 times, you have to sit there like a moron and wait for it to stop pulsing</li>
            <li> I put the charging base inside my desk away from view so</li>
            <li> You get a charging base, brush head and brush handle.</li>
            <li> The storage base that shows room for 4 brush heads WAS NOT included.</li>
            <li> I think this is annoying.</li>
            <li> The solution is to take the head out of the base after you&#x27;re done brushing.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s annoying, but it eliminates the gunk problem.</li>
            <li> Hate the toothbrush head...</li>
            <li> The recharging base is&lt;br /&gt;now</li>
            <li> I hate it.</li>
            <li> why I hate it</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know why they picture it having a base like that.</li>
            <li> The base was not balanced and it did not connect with the brush.</li>
            <li> Bought this in Sept 2013; now in  March 2014, the unit will not charge so it is worthless.  </li>
            <li> if you can imagine that) - so it&#x27;s not too annoying.</li>
            <li> My Cybersonic had head covers and a base for the unit and all the attachments.</li>

            <li> I prefer the two-minute signal and find it mildly annoying to have to count the 30-second signals instead.  </li>
            <li> I hate you for this and will consider not buying from you in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t the base will have toothpaste and water all over it.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s charger base.</li>
            <li> This is the base model in their pro series, but for us, its all we need.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t miss that feature of the charging base at all.</li>
            <li> Has lights indicating &amp;#34;charge&amp;#34; so she knows when to place it on its base to recharge.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Unfortunately, the stutter feature is really, really annoying.  </li>
            <li> So I do not need any timer feature, and the stuttering is just really, really annoying.  </li>
            <li> I hate this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> &quot; meant to get you to switch to another quadrant are annoying, and can&#x27;t be turned off&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You can store it on the charging base or elsewhere.</li>
            <li> I hate the vibrating feeling in my mouth.</li>
            <li> I HATE the sonic vibrating style of any brush</li>
            <li> It eliminates bad breath!</li>
            <li> She was SHOCKED that I had almost NO PLAQUE!</li>

            <li> Disappointed!</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed and would not recommend this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> what a TERRIBLE job it did.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t affect the brush part - just the handle part - and it is very annoying!</li>
            <li> What a horrible feature.</li>
            <li> I HATE ORAL B!!</li>
            <li> the base gets gunky, even with cleaning every part of it every day, but then once a week when you are cleaning your bathroom, do that as well!</li>
            <li> i will never buy anything from this horrible company again.</li>
            <li> This is the worst electric brush I&#x27;ve ever had.  </li>
            <li> way before the horrible Prime Day sales.</li>
            <li> The worst 2 things, tho, are that water somehow gets in the brush head and, unless you take it off and rinse out the inside, it starts smelling like swamp water.</li>
            <li> No longer hate brushing and flossing!</li>
            <li> the worst !!</li>
            <li> Have been using another brand of electric toothbrush for years, but didn&#x27;t know how terrible it was until I started using the Oral-B!  </li>
            <li> Brushing your teeth gets boring.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Our second Oral B. First one lasted 6 years - with wife and I using it 2x a day</li>
            <li> I let you know what my dentist says when I go in.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted at a reasonable price. I don&#x27;t know why anyone would pay more for an electric toothbrush. It occurred to me that if my dentists have always used small round rotating brushes (vs. any other motion), then that must be what&#x27;s best and therefore what I should use. And any electric brush is better than a manual when you consider how many more strokes it produces in the same amount of time.</li>
            <li> I love my new toothbrush. It does a wonderful job of cleaning.</li>
            <li> very basic function..but great product.</li>
            <li> Perfect. I have used the Oral B toothbrush for years and I love it. Bought this one for my daughter.</li>
            <li> Love this Toothbrush! My teeth feel so clean!!! Highly recommend this product! My last Oral B lasted for 10 years!!!</li>
            <li> When I finally got around to opening this product when my old Oral B sonic toothbrush died, I couldn&#x27;t believe:&lt;br /&gt;(1) how BULKY and awkward the handle was....like a joystick!&lt;br /&gt;(2) how unbelievably LOUD it is. It sounds like a small airplane is landing in the bathroom when I use it.&lt;br /&gt;(3) what a TERRIBLE job it did. I was expecting the same quality I&#x27;d gotten from my past two Oral-B&#x27;s but this was a huge disappointment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What&#x27;s even worse, because I waited until I actually needed it, it&#x27;s too late to return it. I do not recommend this brush at all.</li>
            <li> My new electric toothbrush is excellent and meets all my expectations. As far as I can tell, it is doing a good job.  The charge lasts several days which is quite handy.  I expect to use the this toothbrush for many years as I did my previous Oral-B toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Excellent Toothbrush!!  Works Very Nice and the charge lasts a long time!  The Best Toothbrush I&#x27;ve Ever Bought!!!</li>
            <li> I purchased this toothbrush after reading several reviews that this brush is the best combination of effectiveness and price. I&#x27;ve been using mine this last month and have noticed my teeth to not only feel cleaner, but to look it as well. They look whiter and shinier than ever. In addition, I&#x27;ve notice a little bit of gum re-growth in a spot where it had receded. I was hoping this would be the case, but I wouldn&#x27;t have blamed the brush if this didn&#x27;t happen. However, it has, and I couldn&#x27;t be happier with this brush. Not too expensive, but it still offers all the results of top-tier brushes. It may not have all the bells and whistles, but it has (as far as I can tell anyway) all the performance. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> The Pluses:&lt;br /&gt;1.  Smaller recharge base makes it easier to pack for travel and more stable.&lt;br /&gt;2.  Better grip, seems lighter, less likely to activate button by mistake like older model.&lt;br /&gt;3.  No longer the annoying beeping when recharge is needed, just blinking.&lt;br /&gt;4.  Great value on price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Minuses:&lt;br /&gt;1.  Comes with only one brush head.&lt;br /&gt;2.  Replacement heads are still too costly.</li>
            <li> I plugged it in to charge as per instructions but won&#x27;t hold charge.  Have to keep charging for it to work 2-3 times.  Will buy the phillips the next go round.</li>
            <li> IF YOU LOVE YOUR PARTNER &amp; THEIR SMILE YOU WILL CONSIDER IT! UNLESS YOU LIKE AUSTIN POWER TEETH ! IF YOU CARE FOR SOMEBODY WHY NOT CONSIDER CARING FOR THEIR HYGIENE? I BOUGHT 1 FOR MYSELF 3 YEARS AGO AND SEEN A DIFFERENCE IN MY CHOPS.</li>
            <li> I switched to an electric toothbrush on my endodontist&#x27;s recommendation and purchased this one because of both the brand and the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It makes brushing a pleasure and holds a charge well. I may eventually upgrade to one with more features, but am happy with this one for now.</li>
            <li> Complained to both Amazon and the shipping company with no response at all from either.  Will pursue another option and avoid this product in the future.</li>
            <li> My dental hygienist recommended the Oral-B PRO 1000 Electric toothbrush.  So I got one.  Frankly, I did not think it would live up to the &amp;#34;hype&amp;#34;.  I was wrong.  The hype is true.  Use this device every day, floss every day and I think you&#x27;ll be very pleased with the results.  When you run your tongue over your teeth and you&#x27;ll feel the smooth difference.  It&#x27;s the same feeling you get after your dental hygienist cleans your teeth.  Amazing.</li>
            <li> replaced an older model with this and  works just fine. Took out of box, read directions,charged the unit and no problems</li>
            <li> I like it very much, it does its job very well.&lt;br /&gt;Didn&#x27;t like the build in timer that tells you when to move on to the next area in the mouth- I don&#x27;t need an electric toothbrush to tell me how long to brush my teeth. It does so by stopping for a split second and it&#x27;s quite annoying. After a while, I&#x27;ve trained myself to ignore it...</li>
            <li> Bought this to use at our vacation home, and it works every bit as well as the higher-priced Oral-B pro models.</li>
            <li> just like any other brush nothing special. The thing i hate most about thus brush is the 30 second timer instead of a sound it just a short stutter.</li>
            <li> My teeth never felt cleaner!</li>
            <li> Great product.  The brush part could be a little softer in my opinion, but its really a minor complaint.</li>
            <li> I bought this Oral-B electric toothbrush to replace the old one I have been using for the past 15-to-20 years.  If the old one is any indicator of the new one&#x27;s durability, then I should be using my new one for a LONG time.  In fact, the only reason I needed to replace the old one was because the plastic \\&quot;keys\\&quot; on the handle which slots on the brush unit \\&quot;keyed\\&quot; into had worn down over years of daily use.  As a result, the brush unit itself turned a little when in use, not just the brush wheel.  I&#x27;ve now used my new one (I got the Precision 1000 model) for over a week and am very pleased with it.  The brush wheel oscillates quite a bit faster than it did on my older unit, making my teeth feel really clean.  The replacement brush tips I had on hand for my old unit even fit the new one thus saving me the cost of having to purchase different ones for the new unit -- Oral-B replacement brushes aren&#x27;t cheap.&lt;br /&gt;If I had to come up with a complaint, it would be that the charging base is a little insubstantial resulting in it being hard to place exactly where you want it on a flat surface --  it&#x27;s not heavy enough to resist the force of the power cord pushing against it.  Also, the new charging unit does not have a place to wrap excess cord like the old one did; and, no, the new handle won&#x27;t fit on the old charging unit.  But those are minor flaws that shouldn&#x27;t dissuade anyone from buying this toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Added 6/21/13:  I forgot to mention it in my original review, but as \\&quot;icing on the cake\\&quot;, although I ordered this item with Amazon&#x27;s \\&quot;free\\&quot; delivery choice, I received it about 3 days after placing my order.  Thanks, Amazon!</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush, really gives a good clean you can feel</li>
            <li> My Oral-B finally gave out after 13 years of service!  When I had to use a regular toothbrush, I couldn&#x27;t wait until my new one arrived.  My teeth just feel so much cleaner with the Oral-B.  Found out my dental hygenist uses one as well.  Great product!</li>
            <li> I think this toothbrush is a economical solution to having a cleaner mouth.One feature this has that my old one didn&#x27;t is that when it is close to being in need of charge it starts flashing red.</li>
            <li> The feel is just like when I get my teeth cleaned at the dentist.  Also, my dentist is always telling me not to brush too hard and this unit slows down to tell me when I am pushing too hard.</li>
            <li> Good toothbrush, just wondering how well the battery can last, works fine now, but I had one previously and after a while the battery performance just dwells.</li>
            <li> No complaints after several recharges and twice daily use for a few months. I chose this model because it appeared that the vibration might be a low enough frequency that I might actually use it. Yes! I like it just fine.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a pretty good toothbrush, makes my teeth feel clean.  I love the 2 minute timer that let&#x27;s me know when to stop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downsides are that the base can easily collect some toothpastey/watery grime after only a few days if you don&#x27;t dry it off after every single use, which I don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I replaced my old Oral B Vitality toothbrush with this and I really like it.  I like that it has a timer for each quadrant of my mouth.  After using it for only a week, I feel that my teeth are getting more thoroughly clean!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for around a year. Its annoying that there seems to be some kind of gunk that comes out of the top of the handle and runs down the side! &amp; then there is something that leaks out the bottom that creates a sticky ring at the bottom! So about every other week I have to clean this crap off!&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t affect the brush part - just the handle part - and it is very annoying! I can&#x27;t figure out why it does this!</li>
            <li> It is a great toothbrush.  I love the timer on it which keeps me brushing longer.  I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have only used this a short time but so far this unit is much better than my previous Oral B 1000. The battery seems stronger. The rest of the unit is the same as before, no complaints as it is easy to use, lasts a fairly long time and small enough to take on trips.</li>
            <li> i bought this toothbrush after my dentist recommended i switch from regular brushes to electric ones.  you really do get that straight from the dentist feel after every use.  i&#x27;ve noticed a decrease in bad morning breath too when using this brush.  i would absolutely recommend it to anyone.  my only complaint is that it&#x27;s kinda ugly, but it does the job, and it does it amazingly well, so i still give it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> After using this for about 2 weeks I notice that my teeth feel almost as clean as when I get a cleaning done at the dentist.  The battery is good for about a week worth of brushing twice a day although I have only let it die out once, I normally keep it on the charger when I&#x27;m not using it.</li>
            <li> Not very effective. Bursts are limited and very short. I sent mine back. Very small quanitiy of water which you use up almost immediately</li>
            <li> Light weight, durable, great to travel with, rapid charging. Has 30 second quad timer so you know when you done in each area.</li>
            <li> I do love this and prefer it to SonicCare which I had used for over a decade. It&#x27;s because I like the smaller /  round head. However, the brushes do see to wear faster and why the heck does it have to be so expensive to replace? That aspect really sucks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d previously used a Phillips. It was old and getting louder and louder so I decided a new one was in order. Totally pleased with this product. Nothing about it bothers me and my teeth feel super clean afterwards. Very happy about my choice.</li>
            <li> Used this product for a few months then the switch went bad.  Runs all the time unless in charging holder.  Have not used it in months, very frustrated with the short longeivity with the premium price tag.</li>
            <li> Great price.  I would have paid more for the two speed if I researched more. Dentist approved.</li>
            <li> powerful cleaning, and a battery that lasts for days on a single charge!</li>
            <li> Have had one of the original units for a number of years. It still does a good job but I felt that the battery was beginning to lose charge quicker than normal so bought this in advance of a complete battery failure. So far I haven&#x27;t even taken this one out of the box.</li>
            <li> My first electric tooth brush, no problems with it yet. It seems to clean the teeth well, my dentist recommended this brand.</li>
            <li> Fantastic.  Clean teeth.  Easy to use.  Timer to let you know when to tackle the next of the four quadrants (illustration in instruction shows how to divide and conquer).  Affordable replacement heads.</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush !! My teeth feel very clean. Operates quietly.</li>
            <li> Gets the job done!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been a user of electric toothbrushes for the past 18 years.  I started out with Interplak and used that for almost two years, until the battery corroded.  I replaced that first electric with another from the same brand.  Eventually, the Sonicare came out and I switched to that brand.  That Sonicare lasted a very long time.  Sometime around late 2005, I bought my first Oral-B.  The Oral-B was one of their mid-end models and it also lasted a number of years.  The nickel-cadmium rechargeable batteries were still working fine, but the charging base got damaged during a move.  I replaced that one with a cheap model, also an Oral-B.  This cheap model will only hold its charge for about 3 brushing sessions before you notice a significant performance decrease and the unit would need to be fully recharged.  As they say, you do get what you pay for.  There are times when you travel and have to take the brush with you.  It  would be nice to have something that will hold a longer charge.  So, I bought this one.  This one is much better than the previous Oral-B.  It uses the same model of brush head but this model cleans more aggressively than the previous one.  So, here we are, my sixth electric toothbrush in 18-19 years of use.  Of the six models, I would say that the only ones that I did not like were the low-end Oral-B and the first Interplak.  All the rest were good at what they were supposed to do.  You do not need to spend 100+ dollars on a top-model like the Sonicare to get good results.  I have found that the key to getting good performance is to replace the brush head often.  Get the name brand brush head if you can.  The brush heads on the Sonicare tend to last longer than the ones on the Oral-B, but they are also typically more expensive.  It is your choice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can easily recommend this model, the Oral-B Precision 1000, to anybody who wants to use an electric toothbrush.  Spending more money will not necessarily clean your teeth better, in my experience.  What you give up is more features, like UV sterilizing and perhaps additional cleaning modes (like a gentle cycle on your washing machine, some brushes have a mode for delicate users).  My advice when it comes to electric toothbrushes is to avoid the low-end and the high-end.  somewhere in the middle is the sweet spot.  Get a model that uses the same brush heads as the higher-end models and you will get the same cleaning performance.ur teeth better, in my experience.

            <li> My first electric toothbrush. It cleans significantly better than manual, but is pretty loud.</li>
            <li> I love electric toothbrushes, they really get my teeth clean and shiny and I find that I brush my teeth a lot longer than with a manual brush ( which either hurts my gums if I brush too hard or I end up hitting them while trying to maneuver it in the mouth) and I like the small size, it&#x27;s actually perfect. I also find that using gel toothpaste works best with this type of brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a very powerful product, I had brushes that cost twice that and this one seems to put them back in tame territory, and that clean feeling is addictive, I always feel ready for bed when I use this, I also love how it comes with a charger, no batteries to mess and fumble with, easy and convenient.</li>
            <li> This is our family&#x27;s second oral b.  The first lasted for about ten years. The only option we had on our first was a 2 minute timer that let you know you had brushed long enough. This model 1000 was a great replacement for our original.  No bells and whistles just a great toothbrush.  My oral hygenist noticed a huge difference when we had to get rid of our old Oral B.  Now I feel confident that I&#x27;m doing my gums a favor.  As before a great product.  I definately recomend it.</li>
            <li> This is at least my third Oral-b electric toothbrush, the first was a AA battery powered model that wore out mainly from a lack of waterproofing. The second had rechargeable batteries and ran for around $20 in 2003. It did well until the on off switch wore out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first thing I noticed in Oral-b 100 Professional Care 1000 Electric toothbrush is the battery/ charge indicator. It lets you know when the toothbrush is charging, is charged, and needs charged. Depending on your daily use, it can go about a week with the low battery red light comes on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush head technology hasn&#x27;t noticeably changed ]during these years. It does a good job of getting around and between teeth, though the small opening in the plastic casing means, saliva, toothpaste and water will all get in their, which can get gross, unless you rinse well and take the brush head off from time to time to rinse out the inside. I&#x27;m sure there is a reason for this hole, but I think it should go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like most things, it comes down to personal tastes, but I found my [[ASIN:B0019ZGU1S Philips Sonicare R732 Healthy White Power Toothbrush]] does a better job of getting my teeth clean and has three speed settings. It does of course cost twice as much, but comes with a travel case and two brush heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this Oral-B model is acceptable, though I question why it&#x27;s so much better than some of its less expensive counterparts simply because it has a battery indicator and the word Professional in its name.</li>
            <li> Have had it only a few weeks but works great and half the price of my old one which was just like this one.  Go figure.</li>
            <li> I was a bit sceptical about this product at first, thinking it was just something my dentist was endorsing, but I must say, it truly is amazing. Every time I use it, I feel like I&#x27;ve just had a proper cleaning from the dentist, and don&#x27;t think I ever want to go back to using a normal toothbrush. Cannot recommend this electric toothbrush highly enough.</li>
            <li> I love oral b and the fact that I found it cheaper at amazon® makes it even better!  I&#x27;m a prime user and it&#x27;s the best investment I have ever made!</li>
            <li> Although my teeth feel really, really clean when I&#x27;m done, I am disappointed in how it feels while brushing, it&#x27;s like a jackhammer in my mouth. Not sure if it&#x27;s supposed to feel this way.  I&#x27;m wondering if constant use would loosen any fillings or caps that I have in place. I try to use it very gingerly, but I&#x27;m still not comfortable with it.  So, I use it only once in a while and usually stick to my regular electric toothbrush, the Oral B with 2 minute warning, simple, gentle on my gums and teeth, and it only cost me about $25.00.</li>
            <li> My son, who has braces, uses this toothbrush and it is effective in cleaning his teeth. He loves it and doesn&#x27;t want a manual toothbrush anymore. This Oral-B toothbrush charges really quickly and the replacement heads are not too expensive. The heads do need to be replaced every 2-3 months. I recommend this toothbrush for anyone with braces because the head spins really quickly to get teeth even cleaner than manua brushing.</li>
            <li> If I could rate this item a ZERO I would.  Low quality appearance and feel; brush head is small and hard as a rock; the vibration is weak and actually sputters--even when not touching the teeth.  This is a piece of junk--DO NOT BUY.  It is now a toy for our 4-year-old son.</li>
            <li> I got what I wanted. An electric toothbrush with a circular head, keeps a good charge, easy to maintain, and at a good price. It works great! Probably not the best out there but I&#x27;m very happy with it. I decided to take my old manual toothbrush with me on vacation the other weekend and I simply didn&#x27;t feel like it was effectively cleaning my teeth. I&#x27;ve been spoiled with this :)</li>
            <li> the voltage is 110V AC. it cannot be used in China. But if it canbe shipped to China, you have to warn me that at least.&lt;br /&gt;Bad experience!  It was damaged during the first charging.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush does a thorough job of cleaning the teeth.  I like the 30-second timer for each quadrant,  and the availability of  various types of replacement  brush heads.  The Amazon price was great and significantly lower than the price in local stores.</li>
            <li> Wanted an electric toothbrush for a long time, and got this with a 50% off rebate and couldnt be happier. as good as the expensive if you dont need extra lights and bells literally. Great fast service and my teeth look great after only a week :)</li>
            <li> Why I didn&#x27;t replace my older model with this one I don&#x27;t know. The first time i used it i felt like i was finally brushing my teeth. Especially like that it tells you when it has to be recharged. Good price.</li>
            <li> This is a toothbrush that is really just as advertised and it does a great job. It replaces an Oral-B that I have had for many years, but had to be recharged every week, and did not have much power.&lt;br /&gt;The only complaint I have against the Oral-B 1000 is that it takes 17 hours to recharge after using it for 8 or 9 days, but since I still have the old Oral-B I use that one while the new one is charging. It seems to get my teeth (and my 2 removable bridges) much cleaner than the old one and is one I would highly recommend because it has a lot more power than the old one and does such a good job.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not just the noise, which you&#x27;ll get used to eventually.  But if you don&#x27;t have a big mouth or some special skill which I seem to lack, the machine will CATCH ON YOUR LIPS or even your tongue.  I admit that I haven&#x27;t actually been WOUNDED yet, but it is certainly disconcerting, and the first couple times it might scare you, so be warned.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had Oral-B electric toothbrushes for years that take replaceable batteries, but the battery cover is too difficult to remove/replace and eventually cracks. I purchased this one since the battery recharges electrically, and it is so much better than the other, cheaper models I&#x27;ve used in the past. Power lasted about 3 weeks before needing to recharge again with 1-2x daily use. Makes my teeth feel so smooth again.</li>
            <li> Love it.  I replaced my older Braun (at least 7 yrs old that still works) with this one.  Quieter and teeth feel squeaky clean.  I rather like the build in timer, doesn&#x27;t bother me at all.</li>
            <li> Lasts about 3 years, cleans teeth well, good value</li>
            <li> My teeth never felt this clean with my previous ordinary toothbrush.  Definitely worth it!</li>
            <li> Well, I am just about to return the Oral B professional care 100 Electric Rechargeable Power Toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt; Since around 1995 I had a Braun Electric Toothbrush that I really liked and it kept my teeth and gums in good condition. After all these years it finally broke down. As I was unable to locate another \\&quot;Braun\\&quot; I purchased the Oral-B. To my dismay, the speed it too fast and after using it my, teeth hurt for days, not the gums, just the teeth. The speed of the toothbrush is so fast I don&#x27;t know how it can possibly clean in between my teeth and gums. I will have to try to find a Braun or try another brand.</li>
            <li> Ordered this item on the 14th and it still did not ship. No email from amazon as to why and btw I ordered this with my prime account.</li>
            <li> I have bought two of this,and I like it so much. I also bought one for my husband.But I still use the regular toothbrush together with this electronic one.</li>
            <li> This Oral-B Professional Care 1000 Electric Rechargeable Power Toothbrush is  more expensive but definitely works better than my Colgate battery-powered toothbrush. I can see the difference in the little specks of food that get loosened from my teeth. It takes a long time to get fully charged, and seems to lose power a lot sooner than expected, but otherwise, it does provide a good cleaning!</li>
            <li> The latest model OralB is quiet and does a good job of cleaning.  The only drawback is that the battery only lasts for 8 1/2 days.</li>
            <li> I went to the dentist after years of neglecting them and pretty much got the bad news of cavities and gum disease.  The first thing they told me to do was get an Oral-B rechargeable toothbrush.  This has been one of the best pieces of advice I&#x27;ve ever received.  It feels like I have new teeth.  I brush twice a day but even if I forget to brush one night, the next morning my teeth STILL feel clean.  Of course I floss, water pik, and use mouth wash too but this brush has been the true game changer for me.  And for the confused users out there, the pressure sensor does not turn the brush off.  It stops the \\&quot;3d\\&quot; motion, which means the brush continues to spin but doesn&#x27;t vibrate towards and away from the tooth.  You can tell its activated because the brush will sound different.  Either way I&#x27;d HIGHLY recommend this brush.  I&#x27;ve only used the regular head that&#x27;s come with it but I&#x27;ve heard the floss action is even better so its possible this brush may be even better than this.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s fantastic!I used it daily and feel great. l like it very much!It&#x27;s easy to exchange and use. The trushhead has a good size for move it wherever in the mouth.</li>
            <li> I will never brush my teeth with a regular toothbrush again. This thing is just TOO fun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The vibrate feature alerting you to switch sides or end your brushing is particularly cool. I feel like I&#x27;m able to get every nook and cranny of my teeth clean.</li>
            <li> Good, good informative book</li>
            <li> This was terrible, worked fine initially but suddenly stopped working after only around 6 months. The website asks for proof of purchase and we have to pay our own postage to return it. This is no good, do not purchase this product.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t take much space on the counter, easy to use and handle is slim to hold. Too bad this does not come with a brush-head cover as this would&#x27;ve earned a five star rating.</li>
            <li> This is my second Oral-B electric toothbrush. I lost my first on a recent trip. The very first time I used this toothbrush I knew I could never use a manual toothbrush again. You get a very clean after dentist visit feeling the very first time you use it. It works so well sometimes I don not use toothpaste and it still leaves your teeth with a very clean feeling.</li>
            <li> I have been using Oral-B electric brushes for as long as I can remember.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Works well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problem, and its a huge problem, is cleaning the brush. Rinsing thoroughly and shaking off water may seem all that is needed. It may look clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now try shaking the brush head vigorously. A lot of black slime will pop out. Looks like bacteria! After inserting a small stiff brush in every crevice I could  see and shaking the brush head again, more black slime appeared. Well and truly shocked, I used a pulsating water aerator (water pik) just to see whether any more black slime remained. And indeed there was. Lots more. All these from a brush head that looked perfectly clean on the outside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are using an Oral-B brush head, it is almost certain to harbor a considerable amount of black slime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can only speculate that the slime is generated by the moisture trapped in the many parts within the brush head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rinsing and leaving it to dry will not prevent it. Neither will shaking the brush head vigorously clear all of it. The brush head needs to be redesigned. In the meantime, I would recommend flushing all the slime out with a water pik.</li>
            <li> Bought to replace an older OralB toothbrush.  This one operates at a much higher speed and works GREAT with the floss action\\&quot; heads.  Well worth the upgrade price!  Just wish it came with a few accessories like a travel case and a brush holder.</li>
            <li> replacing the one i have had since they first came out so  just ordering the same product  many many  years later. if it works why change</li>
            <li> I have one and  I love it. However, these are gifts for my grandchildren.</li>
            <li> As usual Oral-B makes a great electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> exactly what I wanted works great</li>
            <li> As expected is as good if not better than the one purchased 10 years ago.</li>
            <li> Works ok but battery life pretty short.</li>
            <li> This replaced a 10-year old Braun/Oral-B electric toothbrush.  It works much better than the old one and after brushing it feels like I just left the dentist&#x27;s office!</li>
            <li> This is the past toothbrush I have ever owned. It cleans your teeth so thoroughly that they truly feel &amp;#34;squeaky clean.&amp;#34; This may sound a little odd but I actually look forward to brushing my teeth with this :-)</li>
            <li> After several weeks of use I&#x27;ve been pretty happy with this brush.  I can&#x27;t say as some do that it&#x27;s like a dentist&#x27;s cleaning, since the brush doesn&#x27;t scrape off hardened plaque build-up, of course, and there are places between teeth no brush can get, but it&#x27;s very good, leaves a nice smooth clean feel.  It&#x27;s definitely better and faster than my manual brush, easier on my gums, and the small brush head more easily reaches hard-to-reach spots.  It has plenty of oomph and a solid, precise feel, better than some others I&#x27;ve tried.  A charge holds for five or six days of moderate use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only misgivings so far apart from cost (see below) are minor.  The instructions recommend unplugging the charger between charges, which is a slight inconvenience, though that should probably be done for most chargers these days.  There&#x27;s a light on the brush that flashes red when it&#x27;s ready to be recharged.  It seems to still have a lot of power left when that starts happening, enough I&#x27;ve found to go for a couple more days at least.  The feature that notifies me every 30 seconds and every two minutes how long I&#x27;ve been brushing, by making the brush stutter, is a mild annoyance, and can&#x27;t be turned off.  Some like that reminder, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This kind of brush is a lot more expensive than a manual brush, of course, and replacement brush heads aren&#x27;t cheap either.  A brush head is expected to last about three months.  Since it seems to be more effective, and cavities and other dental issues are even more expensive (and no fun to remedy), the cost may be worth it.  Currently there&#x27;s another package ([[ASIN:B000050FDE Oral-B Professional Care 1000 Power Toothbrush]]) sold at Amazon that has the same model number brush and comes with two different kinds of brush heads instead of the one head that comes in this package, and is cheaper.  That model does look a little different, though, maybe a little bulkier in the handle, so it may be an older version.  Judging from its reviews, which go back several years from when the model was called the 3D, it works just as well. (The 1000 model number replaced the 7400 model number which replaced the 3D number, all without any claim of being a new model, but no doubt there have been some updates to it over the years.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon sells a lot of replacement heads that fit this brush (and there are several kinds of heads that fit).  It appears from wading through the reviews that the cheaper ones are likely to be fakes, not true Oral-B parts, and that they may soon fall apart, with some risk of cutting the mouth.  I suggest buying from Amazon directly, instead of from a third-party supplier through Amazon, or from a reliable brick-and-mortar store, to ensure you get the real thing.ack several years from when the model was called the 3D, it works just as well.

            <li> So much cheaper than the store works great</li>
            <li> Extremely thorough cleaning. Not too much discomfort, although it is slightly aggressive. I guess this is a good thing, and luckily you have the ability to back off on the pressure you apply. I have a few cavities and this made them slightly uncomfortable, but other than that, a high quality product. Felt more substantial, longer lasting and pleasant than my wife&#x27;s $12 vibrating brush. Further, I have no clue how the charger works (appears to have no metal and be fully water-sealed), but it does.</li>
            <li> works exactly as advertized</li>
            <li> This is the third Oral B toothbrush I have purchased and I continue to be impressed by their products. The rebate was definitely a bonus!!</li>
            <li> Ordered as a gift, but heard she is using it daily.</li>
            <li> This item is a must have. It leaves you feeling like you just stepped out of the Dentist&#x27;s chair. The product was delivered promptly and its a must buy!!!</li>
            <li> Works really well, need to take your time. Priced great! Thanks so much!</li>
            <li> As many reviewers have said, the brush can be a bit rough at first, but you get used to it. I think that this toothbrush has the advantage that it is very affordable compared to other brands. It also leaves your teeth very clean. Easy to charge. Easy to set up. Been using it for a month and no problem so far!</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush so far it works great.</li>
            <li> It cleans my teeth and hasn&#x27;t given me any problems.</li>
            <li> Oral B rechargeable electric tooth brush is wonderful.  I&#x27;ve been using it for years.  It&#x27;s long lasting and require no maintenance. The one I just purchased is for my daughter and she will love it.  The one I have for myself is over 15 years  and it&#x27;s still going strong.  I would recommend it to any one that&#x27;s looking for a good electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Bought as a replacement for an old electric toothbrush that quit working. I like this one. The action is effective but doesnt tear your gums up. It cleans very well and is comfortable to hold. Some people will like all the notifications it gives you when you&#x27;ve brushed for 30 seconds, two minutes, and so forth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; It&#x27;s easy to clean and water doesnt get inside it. I like that the charging stand has a very small foot print, so it&#x27;s unobtrusive on the vaniety. The unit holds a charge for at least a week when I travel, so I dont even take the charger along. I read a bunch of reviews and articles about electric toothbrushes when I was looking for a replacement for my old one, and I found that dentists and experts agree there is very little, if any difference between various types of motions in electric brushes. Electric works better than manual, since you tend to brush longer and correctly. However, spinning, thrusting, jerking, and whipping isn&#x27;t necessary to good teeth and gum healh. This brush was recommended by more experts because it&#x27;s effective and affordable. If you need the bells and whistles to be happy, have at it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, if the tool does the job and I can afford it, I&#x27;m in. I&#x27;ll buy this again.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re an average American, high-end electric toothbrushes and water picks have always been things you saw in movies on television in the bathrooms of the rich-the people who had good things that you didn&#x27;t have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Oral-b Professional Care 1000 (we&#x27;ll call it, \\&quot;the PC 1000\\&quot;) Electric Toothbrush helps to rectify that; it offers you champaign dental hygiene on something nearer to a beer budget; replacing the manual toothbrush&#x27;s large, dense pack of bristles with a small, circular head that is better suited to accessing each tooth&#x27;s surface and removing food particles at the gumline where the worst of the nasty, irreversible damage happens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using different technologies and approaches, Oral-b&#x27;s high-end toothbrushes like the PC 1000 improve your oral hygiene not only by having a stronger action than the cheap competition (including its own low-cost vibrating toothbrushes), but by encouraging you to change your brushing habits to optimize tooth cleaning and gum health.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brushing with it is such a different experience from using any ordinary, manual toothbrush, that just reading the instruction-sheet can leave you standing there staring as you wonder about the brushing habits you&#x27;ve had for a lifetime. Using it properly involves big changes in the way you do things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first change is that brushing with the Oral-b PC 1000 is counterintuitive: the brush does all the work. The PC 1000&#x60;s head combines a rapid vibrating motion with a rotating action; you use it not by vigorously scrubbing back and forth against the wall of your closed teeth, but by slowly running the brush first over your gums and then over and around each tooth individually. This provides a different and much more thorough cleaning than the one that manual toothbrushes provide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also unlike manual toothbrushes, the PC 1000, helps to keep you honest and following the advice of dental care professionals by automatically reminding you to give each quarter of your mouth equal attention for a total of two minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every thirty seconds, a timer in the brush causes the brush to &#x60;stutter&#x27; in several pulses that tells you to go on to the next section of your teeth and gums, if you&#x27;re interrupted, you can turn the brush off and it will continue the cleaning program from where it left off so long as it isn&#x27;t turned off for more than thirty seconds at a time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s what it does and how it does it. Oral-b claims that using the PC 1000 remove double the amount of plaque that a manual toothbrush can and that using it for fourteen days will help arrest or even partially reverse the progress of gingivitis. I can&#x27;t tell whether this is true or not without consulting a dentist. I do know that I have brushed with it and felt it loosen and remove firmer food particles from between my teeth by brushing alone and that is just scary-as in scary good performance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I&#x27;m impressed with the Oral-b Professional Care 1000. It is simple to charge (plug in charging stand, put toothbrush on it) and, when used properly, it changes not only how you brush but your entire attitude towards brushing; while the cost of it is not much more than what you would pay for not too many of Oral-b&#x27;s own vibrating manual toothbrushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like it. I wish they had made them at this price many years and many dental complications ago.total of two minutes.     Every thirty seconds, a timer in the brush causes the brush to &#x60;stutter&#x27; in several pulses that tells you to go on to the next section of your teeth and gums, if you&#x27;re interrupted, you can turn the brush off and it will continue the cleaning program from where it left off so long as it isn&#x27;t turned off for more than thirty seconds at a time.

            <li> It appears that Braun has become exclusively a saving company and they have are leaving Oral B to brand/produce the line of electric toothbrushes. The bottom of the toothbrush (in addition to \\&quot;Made in Germany\\&quot;) is labeled \\&quot;Braun\\&quot;. Why is this a big deal? Well my wife has had a Braun 3D Excel for 10 years and it has worked flawlessly. The Oral B 1000 is virtually identical - except it does not have variable speeds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A run down on the Oral B 1000-&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Nice charging stand - the Oral B 1000 can be charged even if some water is present due to its non-metal-on-metal contact between the charger and the brush.&lt;br /&gt;- Oddly, it is only 1 speed. I am not sure if there is a need for variable speeds, since I only use the high speed, but the Oral B 1000 only offers 1&lt;br /&gt;- Nice rubberized grip&lt;br /&gt;- Replacement heads are not overly expensive&lt;br /&gt;- Not too loud - a humming sound is all that you hear&lt;br /&gt;- Battery life - pretty decent - you take it on vacation without worries&lt;br /&gt;- An efficient way to brush - the rotating heads really are more effective than standard brushing. This will help you remove more plaque from your teeth!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Final Verdict -Whether you call it a Braun or and Oral B - the Oral B 1000 is a top choice for a moderately priced electric toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5 Stars</li>
            <li> Wish this had a lower speed. One is fast and 2nd is just a little less faster.  Too much vibration&lt;br /&gt;can cause issues with teeth</li>
            <li> High qualiity and good features like the 30 second beep and the 2 minute beep.  Battery is long lasting. Great toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Reliable and it works well,</li>
            <li> Oral-b 1000 Professional Care 1000 Electric Toothbrush cleans teeth much more than manual toothbrushes. It&#x27;s head gently pulsates to break up plaque and rotates to sweep it away, removing up to 2x more plaque than a regular manual brush . Oral-b professional care 1000 also helps improve gum health by helping to prevent and reverse gingivitis (according to Oral B). I can feel my teeth is cleaner and my mouth feels fresher compared to using manual brushes (kind of similar feeling after going to the dentist for regular cleaning). No brush can replace flossing however (so continue to floss).  This tootbrush is rechargeable (come with the base) and very comfortable to grip. THe head is small enough to reach hard to reach areas and will surround and clean each tooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some drawbacks are: the brush is supposed to stop pulsating when you pressed too hard, but sometime you push hard and it doesn&#x27;t stop and some other time you don&#x27;t push too hard and it stop (i.e. not very consistent. the idea is great however). The battery is not replaceable (it&#x27;s sealed, but probably for the better so water will not leak inside). Lastly, the brush head replacement is quite pricey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sidarta Tanu</li>
            <li> In the product description it says &amp;#34;The pressure sensor lights up if you brush too hard to prevent harmful over-brushing,&amp;#34; but that is not the case for the Oral-B PRO 1000. I wish I had realized that before I opened the package.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the comparison chart it does indicate that there is no visible pressure sensor.</li>
            <li> Great electric toothbrush, but I don&#x27;t like having to toss or recycle the whole handle because the battery can&#x27;t be replaced when it dies after a couple of years.</li>
            <li> This is my second Oral-B electric toothbrush, my first failed after years and years of reliable service because the battery could no longer hold a charge.  This new unit cleans my teeth exceptionally well, is stoutly built, and should last at least as many years as its predecessor.  The rest of my family uses the very prominent and considerably more expensive alternative whose name rhymes with tonic share.  I tried to use that brand, but could never get used to the uncomfortable sensation it created in my mouth and gums, so I went with the Braun Oral-B.  In the time I&#x27;ve gone through one Oral-B brush, my family has gone through 2 of the competitors.  Switches failed or batteries wore out - requiring them to purchase expensive replacements while my trusty Braun kept reliably plugging along.  I&#x27;m not saying they make a bad product, but the Oral-B brush gets your teeth every bit as clean, cost considerably less, and are more reliable and long lasting.  In my book, that&#x27;s a 5-star product.</li>
            <li> This works so well, my other one vibrated too much and made it uncomfortable. This one has a perfect sized head and is easy to reach all teeth</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had Oral-B Electric toothbrushes for 23 years and they keep my teeth white and my gums in good shape.  Well worth the cost. I&#x27;ve now had my Oral B 1000 for 6 years and the battery seems to be dying. Will definitely get another one.</li>
            <li> good product; feels clean. a little sluggish if you press to hard but does a good job if you take your time</li>
            <li> I bought this to use while I waited for Norelco to send me a replacement for a defective Sonicare (the second one to go bad, but Norelco has been good about replacing them at no cost).  I was pleasantly surprised to find that it works just as well as the Sonicare, and even though I have my replacement, I&#x27;m still using the Braun most of the time.  The Sonicare is quieter and has an auto shut-off that the Braun lacks, but the Braun&#x27;s smaller, round brush head makes it easier to reach farther back in the mouth.  They weigh about the same, but the Braun feels a bit more comfortable.  The big drawback is the noise, but it&#x27;s not enough of a problem to keep me from using it.  The other possible issue is that Braun&#x27;s guarantee requires the consumer to pay shipping to return the toothbrush if it develops problems, whereas Norelco sends you a new one with a postage-paid label to return the defective one. Still, for the money, this is hard to beat.</li>
            <li> I take good care of my teeth, and it shows. This works very well and I recommend this product to all.</li>
            <li> We ordered 2 of these electric toothbrushes and love them! Our teeth feel much cleaner since using them! We highly recommend them to anyone looking for an electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> it is not the toothbrush i expected to get. i believe oral-b describes one of their brushes in the ad, as well as the inst. book, but not this one. it must be the 5000 or whatever; it was not the 1000.</li>
            <li> this worked great for awhile.  One night, after using it, I put it on the charger.  The next night it would not turn on.  I&#x27;ve left in on the charger for days, so either the battery is shot or the switch is.  The low battery indicator light does not flash when i push the on button.</li>
            <li> brush han little to no power.&lt;br /&gt;touch it to your teeth, it stops.&lt;br /&gt;It dsen&#x27;t brush, it sucks.</li>
            <li> Nice and work perfect</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my father. It looks nice. And I think it&#x27;s really a good deal when the rebate is still available.</li>
            <li> The motion is really nice, however it is missing the ability to change speeds. The charger is a lot bulkier than expected.</li>
            <li> One word can only describe how clean this toothbrush cleans your teeth.... Very.. clean that is.  Much better than my old but trusty vitality.  I couldn&#x27;t imagine trying to clean my teeth this well with a manual toothbrush.  You would probably wear your gums away before you came close.</li>
            <li> Oral-B Professional Healthy Clean Precision was more than expected. This was the 2nd one that I have gotten for my husband. After charging, he began brushing. The old one had simply worn out, he used it so much. I hear this sound from the bathroom &amp;#34;Wow, this one is so much faster, Love it!&amp;#34;. Two satisfied customers.</li>
            <li> Love the full rotating spin of this brush.  Does what it promises.  Very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Excellent update:  new stutter timing feature is great; flashing light while recharging; slimmer, cleaner design in handle and recharging stand.  (last one lasted 20 years!)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of the modern electric toothbrush - and so is my dentist!  Properly used, these toothbrushes clean your teeth in all the hard to reach places (smaller brush head), and when gently held at a 45 degree angle near the base of the tooth, are excellent for removing the tartar that collects near the gum.  I have been using the Oral B brand for years and years.  I purchased an Oral-B 1000 to replace an older unit.  Unfortunately, replacement is necessary after several years b/c the battery loses its ability to hold charge.  Granted this might make the Oral B electric less \\&quot;green\\&quot; than an old-fashioned toothbrush, but in the whole scheme of things, I think it&#x27;s a small price to pay for a life time of oral health. Apparently it is possible to replace the batteries if you&#x27;re comfortable handling circuit boards and soldering guns (You Tube)...I&#x27;m not, but I promise to properly dispose of the old toothbrush!  In any case, I love this new brush - it&#x27;s more \\&quot;powerful\\&quot; than the old one and has a smaller footprint on the bathroom counter.  So far, so good.  Assuming it lasts as long as its predecessor, I heartily recommend this toothbrush!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used an Oral-B electric toothbrush for years and only recently switched to the Oral-B 1000 Professional.  The 1000 Professional is slightly smaller than my previous toothbrush and operates at a higher speed.  I like the brushing action of the new brush for its tight and controlled feel in comparison to the previous one which seemed softer and looser with longer strokes.  A single On/Off button on the handle controls the brush instead of the previous two.  Both my wife and I find the button difficult to find by feel due to its small size, and a bit hard to press down.  The one feature we could both do without is the quadrant timer.  It is an annoying and unnecessary feature.  It is only because of the On/Off switch and timer that I gave it 4 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over the years, I have developed my own technique to keep the toothbrush fresh and clean.  It is to run water over the brush and tip of the brush holder with the brush operating. Once clean, I remove the brush and run water over it and the tip of the brush holder, with the brush holder momentarily running.  This cleanses both the brush and brush holder shaft seal.  Once rinsed, I dry the brush and brush holder tip with a towel, momentarily running the brush holder as I wipe it dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Oral B-1000 Professional electric toothbrush is an excellent, quality product.  Other models in that line have additional bells and whistles that for most people are unnecessary and therefore not cost effective.  Whether you currently use an electric toothbrush or have never used one before, you&#x27;ll most probably be happy with it.</li>
            <li> Died/not charging after less than a year/ 30-50 uses. AVOID!</li>
            <li> This is a really nice brush.  I&#x27;ve never used an electric toothbrush before.  I can really notice that it is working way better than my manual toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I had previously used the Oral-B battery powered electric toothbrush (the $15 one that uses AA batteries).  This toothbrush has much more power and cleans a lot better.  I got this toothbrush for $29.  Watch the price, it fluctuates a lot.</li>
            <li> Just what I needed - however I saw the same thing at Target for less.....</li>
            <li> This is my second Oral-B electric toothbrush &amp; I have been very happy. My old one finally bit the dust after about 7 years of use. I liked the old one &amp; I love this one also. The 50% rebate offered by Procter &amp; Gamble made it a very good bargain. I definitely recommend this product to others.</li>
            <li> I have used the Oral-B 1000 Professional Care only for a few days and I&#x27;m very happy with it. This is my second electric toothbrush and I can say its significantly better than my first. It&#x27;s functional and effective, slightly harsh but good for my damaged gums. My teeth feel fresh and envigorated after brushing.It was recommended by my periodontist and I think its perfect. I&#x27;ve already bought some optional head brushes for versatility of jobs. Good price too.[[ASIN:B003UKM9CO Oral-B 1000 Professional Care 1000 Electric Toothbrush, White and Blue]]</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter.  She uses it a couple times every day and swears by it.  She told me her Dental Hygienist commented that there was less plaque to clean off and asked if she was doing anything different.</li>
            <li> This is a really nice mechanical brush. Works fine and holds charge really long. I wish I had switched earlier.&lt;br /&gt;Please make sure you wipe the metal rod that holds the brush head, as it comes in contact with water after use.</li>
            <li> I purchased this to replace my previous Oral B Triumph (equivalent to the Oral B 4000 current model) that wore out after several years of use. I was happy with the Triumph which had an LCD display showing digital brushing time, tells when to replace the toothbrush head, charging status, etc. and also had 2 additional modes of sensitive and polish. Since I didn&#x27;t find the digital info useful and always used the normal mode which was never a problem for my sensitive teeth, I decided to \\&quot;downgrade\\&quot; to the no frills Oral B 1000 model featuring one speed and no display. I am very satisfied with its performance and I like the slimmer handle and lighter weight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had to go back to manual brushing while I waited for the Oral B electric toothbrush to arrive and there is a huge difference in the results. No matter how long and carefully I manually brushed, I could not achieve the thorough cleaning that I got with power brushing. It&#x27;s definitely a difference in clean that you can feel and is impossible to achieve with a manual brush. I highly recommend this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> This electric toothbrush works great and recharges quickly. It is a tad unstudy on it&#x27;s small base....but it takes up little room on the bathroom counter.&lt;br /&gt; The price seemed a little high....but it came with the %50 rebate so I was very happy!</li>
            <li> My first Oral-B was a Vitality which I liked very much and it served me well for over 7 years.  I took a step up to the Professional and am very glad I did, it seems to do a better job, but I miss the 2 minute shut off that the Vitality had. I would definitely recommend this to a friend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had previous versions of this brush which have worked well over the years.. earlier units were basically the same but had multiple speeds and a large charging base to hold multiple brush heads, both of which I never used.  Both were great at cleaning my teeth..  But this new model is simpler and just as effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me it&#x27;s helpful this has just one speed setting.. on &amp; off.  This way I can rinse the brush and continue brushing without having to go through 4 button presses each time to stop the brush.  You don&#x27;t want to pull a moving brush out of your mouth because it will make a mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Battery life is excellent, running 1-2 weeks between charges.  The handle has an LED to indicator that blinks red when the battery is low.&lt;br /&gt;The charging base is tiny and simple.  Replacement heads are sold everywhere and are not expensive.. I get months of use out of a single head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife uses the Sonicare vibrating toothbrush, which I hate.. the buzz it makes in my mouth causes my skin to crawl!  I&#x27;m skeptical as to the performance of Sonicare&#x27;s vibrating head vs. a scrubbing head like the Oral-B.. I think the Oral-B cleans better and gets into the gumline as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Oral-B is highly recommended by me!</li>
            <li> Oral-B has a number of brushes available - the Sonic, Vitality, the Professional Care family (which comprises the 1000 and 3000), and the Professional Care SmartSeries (4000 and 5000). The Oral-B 1000 is the entry level of the Professional Care series.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my usage of the Vitality and the Oral-B 1000, the Oral-B 1000 stands at the minimum level of functionality to make an electric toothbrush viable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For example, the Vitality does not have a quadrant timer (it beeps only at the end of the 2-minute cycle), is rated at only 7600 oscillations per second, and does not have battery charging indicators.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brushes in the Professional Care series on the other hand add quadrant timers, and are rated both at 8800 oscillations per second and at 40,000 pulsations per second.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As you go higher in the Professional Care family you get multiple brush modes (daily clean, sensitive, polish, deep clean), pressure sensors, and even wireless displays.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, the brush is simply wonderful. I&#x27;ve tried the pro white, precision clean, and dual clean brush heads, and I&#x27;m simply thrilled with each, though the dual clean head is my favorite. It works noticeably better than my manual toothbrush, in particular with cleaning between my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m definitely a happy camper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do note that the Professional Care 1000&#x27;s specifications indicate the presence of a pressure sensor. Unfortunately this does not work on my brush - and given the experience of other reviewers - I&#x27;m inclined to think this is simply a misprint in the specs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy Brushing!</li>
            <li> Great brush though I don&#x27;t have anything to compare it with since I am a first time user.  Researched all others and for the price it&#x27;s a great buy. I don&#x27;t think I would have used all the bells and whistles that other brushes offered.  This one is simple and straightforward.  There is no room for other brush heads to be stored on the stand but this is not an issue for me since I am the only one using the brush.  The precision clean brush head is not too hard or soft and does a great job.  I have sensitive gums and did not find this brush head to be too abrasive.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this. Long battery life (2 weeks before recharging).</li>
            <li> stop working in 1st day</li>
            <li> Last one lasted 12 years. Hope to get at least that long with the new one. A marvelous machine.</li>
            <li> I got this to replace a Sonicare and I am satisfied with its performance.  It is a little loud, but my teeth feel much cleaner than with Sonicare.  I think a lot has to do with the small round brush head.</li>
            <li> I feel like I just left the dentist after using this!</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B003UKM9CO Professional Care 1000 Electric Rechargeable Power Toothbrush 1 Count]]&lt;br /&gt;This is a great price for this electric rechargeable toothbrush!  I already have this particular product, so ordered this one for a Christmas present from Amazon.  I am very happy that it arrived very promptly after I placed my order.</li>
            <li> This thing cleans better, hands down.  Teeth feel very clean after use and i&#x27;m sure my dentist will notice a difference on my next visit.  I wouldn&#x27;t buy a more expensive model, you&#x27;re wasting money at that point.  This thing does the job, does it well, with no frills.</li>
            <li> Replaced an old (10+ years) Oral-B toothbrush with their new Professional Care 1000. What an improvement over the old one.  Using it is like going to the dentist every day for a cleaning.</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush. Much cheaper than other options.</li>
            <li> Works great for my husband</li>
            <li> Product exceeded expectations. Very pleased with whole experience.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Original Oral-B 3D Electric toothbrush for about the last 5 years and have been loving it before it finally died. I paid twice as much for the OLD version than I did for the new version 1000 model. The main differences between the two was that the old version had two speeds (which I never used the slower speed anyway) and a much larger base with storage compartments for additional brush heads. I am still using the original base with the new brush. The new brush comes with a smaller base with no storage which is all I would need anyway.&lt;br /&gt;You could pay much more and get the more expensive models with all the additional bells and whistles, but do you really need them? They all brush the same way and give you the same good results.&lt;br /&gt;The extras you pay for are things like an external timer that you can watch to see if your brushing long enough (BTW the 1000 model has timing intervals that are simply momentary pauses every 30 seconds), or Battery level indicators (I keep mine on the charging base all of the time, so the Level indicator would be useless to me), or a flashing LED if you are pressing to hard.&lt;br /&gt;If you already know how to brush your teeth, all the extra&#x27;s are a waste of money in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Replaced one we had for 10 years.  This simple, one speed, auto stop with too much pressure is GREAT.  Wish that this one came with the little adapter to hold two brushes, that would have made this perfect.  But, well worth the price when you compare it to similar items.</li>
            <li> My Dentist finally convince to switch to an Oral-B to protect and clean my teeth better. What a difference! Easy to use and definitely better for the teeth and gums. Great product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a dental freak, my teeth are yellow from coffee stains and I&#x27;m a slacker when it comes to flossing. But damn! I can&#x27;t wait to brush my teeth at every opportunity after using this tooth brush. It feels...smooth and the rhythmic vibration is oddly comforting. Its like my mouth is being cleaned by angels LOL! My only regret is not buying this product sooner.</li>
            <li> I like it only had it for a little bit but so far it&#x27;s good and the price is right.</li>
            <li> It works great.  I had a previous model that finally wore out after about 8 years.  This one should last at least that long.</li>
            <li> Got one for my husband and I and we both love it. Got a GREAT deal as well so very happy!</li>
            <li> Very fast, efficient cleaning teeth.</li>
            <li> This is not the Oral B Tooth brush i own, and ait certainly meets my expectations, Battery last about a week between charges.  The only thing it&#x27;s missing is a travel case.</li>
            <li> A great brush and a clean unlike any I&#x27;ve ever seen!</li>
            <li> Consumers Reports Magazine rated the Oral B smart series (3000 and 5000) as the best electric brushes based on evaluation of users by dentists (using plaque revealing dies).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason the 1000 was not as effective is because it comes with a standard head instead of the floss head like the smart series. The price clubs sell the 1000 series with the floss head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trust me, if you replace the standard head with a floss head (same price for the head), you will get the same highly dentist rated results shown by Consumers Magazine at half the price. The extra thrills of the smart series will not be used by most consumers (sensitive and polishing cycles, feedback display, etc).</li>
            <li> Found I like these &amp;#34;new fangled&amp;#34; toothbrushes... (3rd mo owning one)...cut me some slack here people...I drive a 20 yr old car &amp; refuse to own a cell phone.  Just went from a battery operated Oral B to this one.  A great toothbrush...what&#x27;ll they think of next?  Boggles the mind</li>
            <li> Literature in the box says you can go 3-4 days between charging. Total crap. You&#x27;ll have to charge it every other day.</li>
            <li> For a gift....Hope they like it.</li>
            <li> this is the best toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;Every visit to the dentist is a good one.</li>
            <li> the voltage is not fit for my country ，but the other side is good enough for me</li>
            <li> Excellent replacement!</li>
            <li> Superb value and works beautifully eliminating plaque and stains.  My last one lasted more than 10 years, so I&#x27;m hoping this one will be around for a long time.  I have found that in addition to whitening teeth, the Oral B has significantly reduced the incidence of tooth decay and cavities.  My dental hygienist says there is little for her to do when I show up every 6 months for a checkup.</li>
            <li> This is a great little electric toothbrush.  It does what it needs to do without all the bells and whistles.  The 30 second timer feature is nice too.  Hopefully, it was last as long as my first one.</li>
            <li> I love my Oral-B.  I had an older model and it held up for 3 years before giving out.  The newer model is quieter and has an added bonus of a light that shows when it needs to be recharged.  Cleans well and leaves my mouth feeling fresh and clean.  It&#x27;s not too hard on my gums as other toothbrushes have been.  I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> We received our Oral-b Electric Toothbrushes as order.  There are two toothbrushes, but only one charger.  My wife and I do not find that this a problem since the battery life on each is long lasting. It does the job and in a nice way without shaking your fillings loose like some other electric toothbrushes.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> i really love this thing..brushing is fun for me now..at first i thought sonicare would be better because it has more vibration..but this oralb brush not just brushes but i think massages to the gums with its powerful vibration..</li>
            <li> The battery died after only 8 months, now I need to buy something else..Don&#x27;t do the same mistake, buy a different one.</li>
            <li> Pros: It cleans the teeth thoroughly. The brush head is small enough for a small mouth.&lt;br /&gt;Cons: The drawback is the long charging time for the battery.</li>
            <li> Replaced an older model.  I like the timer, which my older one lacked, and I like the way the light blinks as it is charging and stops when it is charged.  The brushing motion is much better too.</li>
            <li> Works but not great is gust a small round brush the is a little slow.</li>
            <li> Works great but I was surprised by how loud it is!</li>
            <li> I have been using Oral B toothbrushes for quite a long time.  An older model Oral B toothbrush which I have had for many years recently started quitting almost every time I used it.  I bought a new Oral B \\&quot;Professional Care 1000\\&quot; electric toothbrush and threw away my old electric toothbrush.  The next day after having charged the new brush for at least 20 hours as the instructions recommended I used it for literally 30 seconds and it quit working.  As the toothbrush pulsated after the first 30 seconds to indicate that it should be moved to a different part of the mouth, the brush immediately stopped working.  I tried recharging it and replacing the brushhead but it still will not work.  Because I threw away the box and the receipt thinking that there would be no problems with the brush since it was brand new, I have no way of returning it to the store.  I called Oral B who said that it should be under warranty but that I would have to pay shipping (which would NOT be reimbursed) or drive to take it to the closest repair center.  I would NOT recommend buying this brush as the quality is extremely POOR!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had the sonic care and hated how it felt.  It kind of tickled and didn&#x27;t feel like it was doing the job, whether it was or not, leading to me just not using it correctly.  I got the oral b at the recommendation of my dentist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I must say it feels like some type of mouth massage!  I really enjoy it and because of that the 2 minutes of brushing go quicker than I&#x27;d like.</li>
            <li> Finally, an electric toothbrush that is pleasant to use and effective at removing plaque. I had a Sonicare, but the vibration level made it a chore to use, so I didn&#x27;t use it after a few months.I periodically put on a pair of 2.5 diopter reading glasses and usually am dismayed at the amount of plaque buildup I see with normal brushing. Not with this toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having said all that, this toothbrush is not an excuse for not flossing and brushing at least once per day. If you neglect your teeth on a regular basis, this toothbrush is not going to save you from a lecture from your dental hygienist.</li>
            <li> I recently upgraded to the Professional Care 1000 toothbrush from an older, less expensive model. First off, it felt surprisingly more powerful. The newer slender handle design is much easier to manuveur and I love the &#x27;Precision Clean&#x27; style brush head. The cupped design works great, especially around the posterior teeth. My teeth feel and look noticably cleaner and smoother. I like having the option of interchangeable brush heads too. I have used Oral-B electric toothbrushes for many years and highly reccommend them.&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 2016:  After 5 years of use, I just replaced my toothbrush with a new Oral-B Pro 1000 model. It began to lose the ability to hold a full charge and the power was also diminished. This recent purchase is only my 3rd Oral-B electric toothbrush in 16+ years. I bought mine from Target on sale for $39.</li>
            <li> I researched a lot of different options before ordering my first electric toothbrush, and I&#x27;m glad I went with this product. It has just enough features for me, and I like that the base of the toothbrush is wide enough to stand on its own. My husband ordered the Oral B Pulsonic Sonic Electric Rechargeable Power Toothbrush because it was slimmer, and he thought it would take up less space. However, it turned out to have a larger footprint because its charging base is so wide (around 2.5 inches compared to 1.5 inches for the 1000 model).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was stunned at how \\&quot;fresh from the dentist\\&quot; clean my teeth felt when I used this toothbrush. When I travel, I take a non-electric toothbrush and now find myself unsatisfied without an electric toothbrush. At first, I took advantage of the feature of the 1000 model that lets you know how long you&#x27;re supposed to brush each quadrant of your mouth. The toothbrush will pause its normal vibration after a certain period of time, and you get a really thorough clean if you follow its lead. I admit that now I&#x27;m usually too lazy to brush for as long as I should, so I ignore the pauses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This toothbrush holds charge for a long time, so I only plug it in when the low battery indicator comes on. I have to clean the brush regularly because excess toothpaste foam drips down the brush and hardens, but I imagine that&#x27;s an issue with any electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> The timing device keeps you on track for a good check up and bright smile.  You would be amazed at how long 3 minutes (the recommended brushing time) is.  It&#x27;s like getting a professional cleaning daily.</li>
            <li> This is the second Oral-B toothbrush I have purchased and they both are great.  My dentist noticed a difference since I have been using them, less plaque and my gums are in better shape.  I take it with me when I travel, easily fits in a zip lock bag and into the suitcase.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to electric toothbrushes and I decided to try Oral B Sonic Action after Oral B Professional 1000,&lt;br /&gt;because It seemed my first choice, did not vibrate enough. Well, I really found out what sonic action is,&lt;br /&gt;even on the low setting, with very little noise, about a 2 on the 10 scale.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sure this would message and vibrate (occuring in brush head) whatever off your teeth,&lt;br /&gt;but, if your dental setup is many caps, what is that doing to that glue?&lt;br /&gt;I decided to go back to the brushing (twirling clock, counter clock) of the Professional 1000.&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s enough vibrating to message and (with the soft brushes \\&quot;Oral-B Sensitive [3 Extra-Soft Brush heads]\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;had to be purchased separately) cleans all surfaces very well,&lt;br /&gt;very quickly (because of no need for my own maneuvering, which I was overdoing.)&lt;br /&gt;It fits very well in the hand and mouth.&lt;br /&gt;However, the noise for it is about a 4 and The charge only last about four uses for me.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t fall for the $20 rebate scam. You buy the brush you mail everything in then instead of $20 then send you a rebate of $10 with no explanation or anything, when we called they said they would look into it then would call us back, never did. They also said we might have used a coupon with it and they don&#x27;t allow both we dont remember using a coupon when buying it and they now have the original receipt so you can&#x27;t check it or can&#x27;t return it without the UPC. Pretty convenient for them huh? I don&#x27;t even want the brush now since they basically stole my money to get me to buy it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I want my $10 back. Oral B I hope this review costs you more than my $10 you stole. I also might contact the FTC.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the brush goes it suppoed to occulate and vibrate it only occulates and it&#x27;s very rough. I like my old battery operated one better, this is not worth the money.</li>
            <li> Great product at Reasonable price</li>
            <li> Electric toothbrush with Crest 3D white toothpaste have made my teeth whiter.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you both.Definitely recommend the product to all who so ever wants to buy a Electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my hubby and he loves it! Its a great product for the price.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush is doing its job.&lt;br /&gt;My teeth feel clean.&lt;br /&gt;It is easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;I really don&#x27;t feel that I miss the features of the more expensive one.</li>
            <li> I replaced my Sonicare electric toothbrush with this one because I wanted one with replacement heads with soft bristles.  I bought this toothbrush and the Oral-B Power Sensative Replacement Electric Toothbrush Heads, and they work fine for me.</li>
            <li> Nothing wrong with the product, but be careful with rebate offer. You won&#x27;t get it if the seller doesn&#x27;t send you the original rebate form and receipt! Disappointed!</li>
            <li> love it and great reports from the dentist, this is  5th  ............one upstairs and one down stairs in Maine, and we each have one in Fl</li>
            <li> This is my first electric toothbrush, so some of my views might be misplaced, but I thought they would still be valuable to those also looking to make the switch from a manual toothbrush.  The first thing I noticed was that the oscillating action of the brush is pretty intense.  Combine that with the stiffness of the bristles and it definitely takes some getting used to.  I still feel like I would like to have a lighter setting, but I think I just need to adjust to the different feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other thing that is very different is the way is moves the saliva around in your mouth.  The power action is constantly pushing the toothpaste/saliva out of my mouth and I keep drooling on myself!  I had to lean way over the sink and just let the drool roll other wise I keep getting my shirts dirty because it drips right down on me.  Again, just an adjustment thing, so I&#x27;ll keep working to find a way to brush without forcing so much saliva past my lips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do like the small, compact base.  The charging light is green and flashes when being charged.  Once the battery is full, the light stays off (which I like).  The toothbrush also \\&quot;talks back\\&quot; when you push too hard.  I notice that if I try to get too aggressive (like I&#x27;m brushing with a manual brush), the motor stutters on and off so you get the hint.  Slow and gentle is the key to using this thing.  Worn most of the way through the one brush head that it comes with, so I&#x27;ll be shopping around for the best price on replacement heads very soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I would give this product a thumbs up.  Check Oral-B&#x27;s website for mail in rebates too!</li>
            <li> This model is thin and light enough to be used by a 3 year old&lt;br /&gt;It does not have the remote pressure sensor and smiley indicator as the highest end model but in terms of brushing works just the same</li>
            <li> This is my second Oral B electric toothbrush, and I&#x27;ve been very happy with both of them.  The first one is a 3D Excel that I&#x27;ve used for over five years.  The Professional Care 1000 is very similar to the 3D Excel.  From what I can tell, it&#x27;s primarily cosmetic changes - and the 1000 only has one speed instead of two on the 3D Excel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The level of clean achieved with these toothbrushes has been excellent for me.  The amount of time that my dental hygenist spends cleaning my teeth is much lower since I started using the Excel.  IMO, you can&#x27;t go wrong with an Oral B electric toothbrush, and it really comes down to choosing a model based upon the features that you want.  In the five plus years that I&#x27;ve used my 3D Excel, I have never used the second (slower) speed.  I believe that the slower speed is for more sensitive teeth/gums, but the \\&quot;normal\\&quot; speed has been fine for me - and I have sensitive teeth and gums.  So, for me, the single speed on the 1000 was just fine.  I also found that I don&#x27;t use the toothbrush head storage in the larger base of the Excel, so the smaller charging base of the 1000 was great.  Based upon your preferences, you might decide that a model with multiple speeds or a base with storage fits your needs better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a note - the different heads available can be quite different.  So, maybe give a couple different versions a try if you don&#x27;t like what comes with it.  As an example, while I do use the normal brush speed, I prefer the sensitive heads because of my gums.  The heads with the rubber disc in the center can be a bit abrasive to me.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is extremely good. I was surprised that it actually made my teeth noticeably whiter after about 2 weeks. I chose the 1000 model as opposed to the more expensive because it is the same thing, except for a few things that you do not need. Who needs an LCD display when you brush your teeth? lol. I found this model for around $40 so i bought it and i&#x27;m extremely satisfied. The replacement heads are around $3-4 each so keep that in mind. Each charge lasts about 8 days before it tells you its low and you need to recharge and you would not want to go past that because the lack of power is noticeable at that point. It takes about 16 hours to re-charge and its recommended to completely run down the battery once a month to make it last longer. Before this brush, I used the cheap $13 oral b electric precision toothbrush that was made in china and it is nothing in power compared to this. I dont recommend that you re-charge it after every use because it will kill the battery much faster.</li>
            <li> Works well but the pulsing (i.e. it turns off for a split second every 30 seconds) drives me insane. I actually threw the toothbrush today out of rage. Every time it pulses, it adds another pulse: one pulse, then two, then three - all the way up to five. When it pulses 5 times, you have to sit there like a moron and wait for it to stop pulsing so you can continue brushing. I can&#x27;t believe that grown adults need a toothbrush to tell them to &amp;#34;switch sides&amp;#34; or whatever the pulse is trying to tell you to do. Either way, it&#x27;s maddening and obnoxious. I don&#x27;t brush my teeth as often as I should because I dread the pulse. I couldn&#x27;t find a toothbrush that doesn&#x27;t do that. It seems every toothbrush does that these days. What a horrible feature.</li>
            <li> Brush is okay, but the head it comes with needs to be a little bigger.</li>
            <li> Great product - Great Price!</li>
            <li> This is my second electric tooth brush, the fist Oral B having worked as usual for over ten years. This model is a streamlined version of my old one and gives me the same clean feeling. It&#x27;s good to have such a reliable product that I can rely on over the years.</li>
            <li> I bought this toothbrush, new, out of the box. It short circuited at least once every time I used it for three weeks. It was returned and a new brush was sent out immediately. The new brush is worse. It stops and starts several times during brushing. Don&#x27;t believe we will buy oral B products again.</li>
            <li> Very nice product but now does not have dual speeds</li>
            <li> the toothbrush is effective, but the metal pole is rusting and I only used it for 6 days... I don&#x27;t know it&#x27;s a normal problem or only mine has this problem. it really makes me feel upset.</li>
            <li> Seems to be good but I need to get more brushes because it only comes with one.</li>
            <li> Should buy higher models</li>
            <li> I have been using this brush now for almost two months and have found 2 minutes is not enough time to brush my teeth.  This tooth brush signals me every 30 seconds to move on to the next quadrant of my mouth.  The brush makes you think and does not allow you to miss any area.  I find that I could spend more time brushing because it keeps your mind on what you are doing and doing it right.</li>
            <li> This Oral-B Pro works well for my toothbrushing needs.  Using it has lowered the amount of plaque on some somewhat hidden parts of my teeth.</li>
            <li> Works well and really does and excellent job.</li>
            <li> I bought it because I figured the circular brush would provide greater range of motion than the rectangular shape of competitors. It&#x27;s worked well so far, got compliments from my dentist.</li>
            <li> This is the best toothbrush ever. The battery lasts 6-7 days and yes it does take 13 hours to charge. who cares? stop complaining. I put the charging base inside my desk away from view so the blinking green light doesn&#x27;t bother me. But, why would a light bother anyone? Apparently its enough to give this toothbrush one star. This toothbrush improved my brushing habits and is really great if you have braces. I had it for over a year and it works amazingly.</li>
            <li> I own 2 Oral B Pro Care toothbrushes.  Both work great.  The company sucks.  The first one I bought 3 years ago.  There was a $15 rebate.  I mailed the all of the information and 8 weeks later was still waiting.  Call after call finally led to \\&quot;please resend the original paperwork.....really?  How do I re-mail the paperwork you already have.  No rebate. So 3 years later here I am again. Need a travel brush, buy another Oral B....same thing. After 3 months they have no record of my having mailed the rebate forms.  Please send again.  Sent in my photo copies, refused due to sending in copies not originals.  What a scam. I HATE ORAL B!!</li>
            <li> All products were as we expected.</li>
            <li> So far so good. I&#x27;ve noticed that I brush gentler and my gums are thanking me. It makes brushing a lot easier and you don&#x27;t have to think as much about what you&#x27;re doing. Just brush this part, buzz buzz, move to the next part, buzz buzz, etc. Very easy, very effective and makes brushing easy.</li>
            <li> These are great tooth brushes at a reasonable price.  Kids love them and it helps them know when they have brushes long enough because of the built in timer.  Highly recommend any of their models.</li>
            <li> Compared to the other electric toothbrushes I have used, even ones by this brand, this is bulky and unruly. The motor for this isn&#x27;t quite precise enough and I feel like it&#x27;s too much/not targeted. It&#x27;s also very loud. I&#x27;ve gotten used to it so I will try and stick with it, but it&#x27;s definitely worth it to splurge a little more for a better model.</li>
            <li> There is a pressure indicator in the fourth picture of the product description, but the one I received does not agree with it.</li>
            <li> After reading the specs on the many brands and models I settled on this one. There are no bells and whistles just turn it on and brush. The reasons I think I made the right choice are as follows.&lt;br /&gt;1)Price (Shop around I bought mine for $38 free shipping on another site. Even Wally world sells these for $39 + tax.&lt;br /&gt;2)Cleans my teeth better than any mannual brush I ever had.&lt;br /&gt;3)You can buy generic brush heads for $6.45 free shipping. I like these heads better than the OEM brush heads.&lt;br /&gt;4)The charger has a small foot print so it does&#x27;nt take up much room on the counter.&lt;br /&gt;5)I work on a boat and even in rough seas the tooth brush does&#x27;nt fall of the charger.I did have to velcro the charger to the counter.&lt;br /&gt;6)Very easy to keep clean. A quick rinse and a wipe and that&#x27;s it.&lt;br /&gt;In sum I paid $44.65 for the tooth brush and a year of brush heads, cleans my teeth, easy to keeep clean, will not fall off the charger. Fits my needs totaly.</li>
            <li> I do like the product.  It works exactly as intended and holds a charge very well.  The only issue I had is not being able to use the manufacturer&#x27;s rebate because it was not purchased from a retail store and receipts from Amazon would not be honored.  So I would consider that before ordering again in the future.</li>
            <li> She likes it... works like the others...</li>
            <li> I was expecting a simple effective toothbrush, without many bells and whisltles and that&#x27;s exactly what I got. I&#x27;ve been using this brush for a couple of months. It cleans my teeth very well. It did take about 24 hours to initially charge, which surprised me, but recharges quickly after each use.</li>
            <li> I bought this toothbrush to replace my old Oral B Vitality electric toothbrush.  I was looking at another toothbrush, but didn&#x27;t want to spend a ton of money.  Then I found this Oral B and I was thrilled to see it cost half the price and had the same amount of stars.  The biggest reason I wanted to stick to Oral B was because I still had 7 brush heads that I bought for my Oral B Vitality which was gradually dying out.  I was happy to find the toothbrush heads still fit a new model.&lt;br /&gt;After purchasing this product and using it for about a month, I can say I&#x27;m still very happy with my purchase.  I like the 30 second timer which tells me when to change it up.  I also really like the little bit smaller version for this new toothbrush.  The base itself is smaller, barely bigger than the toothbrush handle itself, and the handle is smaller as well.&lt;br /&gt;I also tested the battery life when leaving it unplugged.  On the packaging it tells you at home you can leave it plugged in without draining the battery, but &amp;#34;for the environment&amp;#34; they say it is also recommended to unplug it when not charging.  I left mine unplugged for the first full week until it died completely (I don&#x27;t think I even charged it all the way from taking it out of the box before doing this).  I don&#x27;t keep it plugged in regularly, but it can easily hold full power for a few days.  Unlike the Vitality model it does not start slowing down before it dies completely, so if you travel regularly for more than a few days I recommend charging it completely before you leave.&lt;br /&gt;I hope this product lasts a good 10 years like my last one!</li>
            <li> Handicapped. Spinal cord injury, trouble with my grip. And use for over a year, works great. Hold a charge for quite some time. Reasonable price. Just as effective as the more expensive units. Able to go on vacation for a week plus without having to bring the charger.</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush. I was previously using a battery operated brand and when this was demonstrated to me by my sister, I wanted it immediately. What&#x27;s really terrific about this is that it holds a charge for about a week! I like that because I don&#x27;t have an outlet to dedicate to this, I wouldn&#x27;t like it if it had to be plugged in all the time. Terrific product so far!</li>
            <li> This is a superior product. My teeth have never felt so smooth with any other brush.</li>
            <li> Not much more to say than this is a good electric toothbrush.  I bought it to replace my old model which lasted a few years and I expect this one will also last a while.</li>
            <li> Saved me twice when my wife left the gas on our stove top on.</li>
            <li> Teeth feel clean. It is easy to use, efficient and comfortable, with a good battery life.  I have used other electric tooth brushes but this is the best.</li>
            <li> I thought I was getting what was in the picture. I didn&#x27;t get a brush head holder like the one in the product photo. When I read the instructions manual, it had pictures of a different kind of brush head holder, I did not receive either one. I live in a multi-person house hold and we really wanted that feature and expected it to store all of our brush heads. I don&#x27;t know what we will do now...</li>
            <li> Just love Braun products.  Excellent cleaning, so my dentist says.</li>
            <li> as good as it gets; just one thing: why is there a light to tell me, that the battery is loading? it blinks all night! one feature, one can live without easily;</li>
            <li> I got 20 MIR, so the total price was $25. It is quite a deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And it washes very clean, it has a light to indicate when you need to charge and when it will become full. I love this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I LIKE THE TOOTH BRUSH....HOWEVER WHEN I PURCHASED IT THERE WAS A $15.00 REBATE (VALID WITH PURCHASE UNTIL JUNE 1)........I MAILED IN THE REBATE FORM THE SAME WEEK I RECEIVED THE BRUSH ........I HAVE NOT RECEIVED THE REBATE CHECK AND SOME EIGHT WEEKS HAVE PAST......REQUEST FOLLOW UP ON REBATE....BOBMC</li>
            <li> Compared to a previous model Oral-B toothbrush I owned, this one is like a toothbrush on steroids. It vibrates very quickly and has a long battery life between charges.</li>
            <li> It makes me brush my teeth, because I can be lazy doing it!&lt;br /&gt;I liked that it buzzes every 30 seconds to let you know to move on to another part, and I like that it keeps going even after the prescribed 2 minutes, because my dentist said I need to keep going until 3 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;Yes the base gets gunky, even with cleaning every part of it every day, but then once a week when you are cleaning your bathroom, do that as well!</li>
            <li> Product is fine, works well. But it does not come with the brush head storage bin that they show in the photo. Not cool.</li>
            <li> I bought Oral-B Professional care 1000 a month ago and really like it. The price is reasonable and the functions are enough for a good cleaning.</li>
            <li> Decent toothbrush. I got it after my dentist recommended I used something mechanical to help with plaque build up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing to note is it does let you know when 30 seconds has past, it pulses oddly a few times, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to time for exactly 30 seconds (comparing to myself and a timer). I&#x27;m not sure if the timing mechanism is off on mine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have liked it so far though. If you are look for something with an audible beep or for something with gum care I would look for a more expensive brush. This one does have a few different brush options for sensitive teeth and gums, but only one speed setting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall a good intro to mechanical powered brushes for me, though I might go for something a bit more fancy next time.</li>
            <li> Great little electric toothbrush. I had an older version of this which eventually died. I love it.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking to try a real electric toothbrush (not the Oral-B Pulsar cheapies), this is a good entry point. It gets the job done without a boatload of unnecessary bluetooth bells and whistles. I found that I needed to recharge it about once every two weeks or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT: To clarify, there isn&#x27;t much point in reviewing the heads themselves because Oral-B offers several varieties. This comes with a basic head; I prefer the Flossing head but that&#x27;s all personal preference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brush features a timed brushing cycle with prompts to move to the next quadrant. When used properly (for the full duration and following the prompts) you get a clean superior to a manual and to a battery-powered manual electric (like Oral-B Pulsar, Crest Spinbrush, etc).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The battery is NOT removable and cannot be replaced. I am finding that after about 2.5 years of use the battery is not holding a charge as long; I need to charge it twice weekly, now. I will eventually upgrade to another model.</li>
            <li> easily use and charge :) really motivate me to brush my teeth</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in a love hate relationship with Oral B. Product works great but I&#x27;ve been burned twice by fake Rebate offers.</li>
            <li> Two minute timer makes me brush longer.  Seems to remove more placque thanmy manual brush.  My teeth feel polished.  Charges over night and lasts one week.  Brush heads are much smaller than manual toothbrush, so they hold less toothpaste.  Sometimes I add toothpaste twice. Seems like a fine basic electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I owned an Oral-B brush before that uses battery and it dies. So I bought this one. Much better than my old one. However, I noticed that the charger only supports US voltage (110V), which means I cannot use it when traveling to Asia. Loses 1 star due to this. However, it seems it can lasts for at least two weeks if fully charged.</li>
            <li> nothing negative to say about this tooth brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it does a good job  cleaning and it was inexpensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;my teeth feel great after ever brushing .</li>
            <li> Peppy brush and works well to clean up back teeth. It&#x27;s just the right size to get to the back teeth and give them a good brushing. It comes with a standard head, which is good, but can use and a more advanced Oral B brush, which is better. No complaints, it works as it should... and is sooooo much better to get teeth clean than a manual brush.</li>
            <li> I received the package on time, the toothbrush was as described. I had an oral B several years ago till it wore out; then bought a Phillips Sonicare at the recommendation of my new dentist. I am soooo happy to be back to the Oral B - I feel like it works better and is more comfortable to use. The 30 sec phases work, but it doesn&#x27;t shut off after 2 minutes...which is nice actually!</li>
            <li> I took off one star because this device is a little noisy but bearable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had an old Braun electrical toothbrush that worked like a charm for about 8 years. One day last week, it went to Braun heaven after years of geat service. I did a little research online and Oral B 1000 looked like a great value for what I needed. I dont need an indicator to tell me when to replace the replacement head, when to charge, etc. I can also do without two modes of brushing - just want a model that cleaned my teeth well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I knew that Braun is highly recommended by dentists because it removes tartar and cleans better than manual brushes but I didnt know how well until I had to revert back to using a manual brush. My teeth felt like it had hair growing on it after just 2 days of manual toothbrush use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank goodness, my shipment arrived in 4 days and I can&#x27;t tell you how clean, smooth and shiney my teeth felt after one use! I LOVE running my tongue over my teeth because it feels soooo good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wonderful product. Braun makes great electronics and this is no differnt.</li>
            <li> My 10 year old Oral-B started making a harsh sound when brushing.  Bought this one to replace it.  Nothing to complain about.</li>
            <li> Very good product and the second one we have purchased.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good toothbrush.  No complaints.</li>
            <li> I bought one and loved it. Then bought one for my dentist wife and she loves it. We both use the Floss Action type of brush head. Try it once and you&#x27;ll feel the difference immediately.&lt;br /&gt;I love the 4x30sec cycles for each quarter of the teeth, it disciplines me into adequately brushing my teeth every time.</li>
            <li> Have used the toothbrush for ~1 month now. Much quieter than the older Oral-B toothbrush I had been using (whose battery finally gave up after many years of use). I like the \\&quot;quadrant\\&quot; timer that provides a hint to move from one part of my mouth to the next. I charge it once per week overnight then put away the charger. The charge lasts for 2 brushes per day for a week. I recommend this product to anyone looking to purchase an electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> There are no frills here--no extra attachments, no carrying case--just a tiny charger and a simple toothbrush with a single setting. If that setting had a label, it would be: 11.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the loudest, most powerful toothbrush I&#x27;ve owned. And yes, it leaves you with that \\&quot;just went to the dentist\\&quot; clean, smooth feeling if properly used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the other hand, a sonic brush, with its higher frequency, cleans about as well with less noise. And they&#x27;re quite cheap these days; the [[ASIN:B0002M5JNY Oral-B S-200]] costs significantly less than this one. Both are sleek, well-designed units. I&#x27;m no dental professional, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s wise to pay more for a toothbrush just because it has a little more raw power.</li>
            <li> I have used the Oral B Sonic Complete and the Philips Sonicare toothbruses in the past.  This left my teeth feeling cleaner than both of those.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the cup shaped bristles. They seemed to get down into the gumline better than the traditional shaped heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The charging base is by far the smallest I&#x27;ve seen.  A big plus if your counter space is limited.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is only one speed which isn&#x27;t a huge issue.  The only time I ever used the low speed on the Sonic Complete was when I first started using it and I had to get used to the sensation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The toothbrush gives timed signals to let you know how long you&#x27;ve been brushing.  The speed slows down. It seems like the charge is running out but it&#x27;s just to let you know how long it&#x27;s been going.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> One speed and stops when you push hard so this brush is definitely easy to use.  Might be especially good for kids and the elderly to keep them from hurting their gums.  It can&#x27;t be overdone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make sure you put the paste on by pushing it into the brush and then insert the brush in your mouth before pushing the on button.  The paste will just jump off the brush if you put a bit on top and turn it on. It really doesn&#x27;t take much toothpaste at all for this small head. And you get a nice clean feeling mouth if you brush for the recommended two minutes.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t beat the ultra cleaning this toothbrush provides and for the price, you can&#x27;t beat it.  Groupon had refills for cheap and you don&#x27;t need to switch until every 3-6 months.  Teeth cleanings are much easier with less pain at the dentist.  You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this toothbrush.  It&#x27;s my 2nd try at one of these and I love that there is a &#x27;warning signal&#x27; if I am pushing too hard, which can hurt your gums. My 1st try was 10-15 years ago had no signals and I damaged my gum and had to have a graft...so now I feel I can get the benefit of the better electric toothbrush without worrying that I am not doing it right!</li>
            <li> I waited for over a month before doing this review because I wanted to see if this really works and I am glad to say that it does. My dentist has seen an improvement in my dental hygiene and my teeth feel and look cleaner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have gotten more cavities than I should in the past.  I will know six months from now whether I get less cavities but I am very hopeful that this will happen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The contents of the box are few and this product is easy to use. You get a charging base, brush head and brush handle. You connect the brush the handle and charge it and it is ready to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The instructions suggest that you should brush your mouth in four quadrants and brush each for 30 seconds. The brush changes it vibration speed for a second or two after 30 seconds to let you know that you should shift to another part of your mouth. At the end of two minutes you hear and feel some more vibreations and you are done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you brush too hard the pulsations stop. This is important to me since I have a lot of fillings and sensitive gums and I don&#x27;t want to damage anything in my mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will use a regular toothbrush on occasion if a tooth is hurting me or if it feels like the tooth needs more cleaning.  This does not happen very often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The vibration feeling took a few days to get used to and my gums tingled at first. My gums don&#x27;t tingle any more and I don&#x27;t even notice the vibrations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My dentist feels the round head is better than ones normally found on toothbrushes. I know my teeth are cleaner looking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a simple product that works.  I will try to update this in six moths after my next dental checkup.</li>
            <li> you don&#x27;t have to spend 100. dollars for simple features</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is excellent. The automatic pressure shut-off is great for people with sensitive teeth. Works very well and offered at an excellent price.</li>
            <li> Replacement for old Oral-B electric toothbrush.  So far I&#x27;d say it does an equivalent job to prior.  It might be a bit more powerful or maybe that&#x27;s just because it&#x27;s newer.</li>
            <li> Exactly what we wanted. Great price too! We like the idea of the timer. You get a dental cleaning right at home, it makes your teeth feel so clean and shiny!</li>
            <li> This is the fourth electric brush I have owned and it is hard to find anything wrong with it so far.  It seems to clean teeth well, is easy to keep clean, takes up very little counter space and looks good.  Previous versions from other makers have been hard to keep clean, taken up more room and didn&#x27;t work quite as well.</li>
            <li> The Oral-B professional Healthy Clean Precision 1000 Rechargeable Electric Tooth Brush is GREAT!! I&#x27;ve used the Oral-B toothbrush for years it&#x27;s the best!! You definately had the best price also!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for a few months and for the money you cannot beat the value.  My teeth feel as if they had just left the dentist&#x27;s office every time I use this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Update 4/10/12 - I just had my first dental cleaning after using the Oral B Professional 1000 with the Floss Action brush head for the last four months. The dental hygienist immediately said that it looked like I had gotten my teeth cleaned before coming to her to clean my teeth. When she was later scaling my teeth roots, she said they were smooth like glass. Although I still floss and use a Proxa Brush between my teeth before brushing with the Oral B Professional 1000, doing this routine after breakfast and supper, I&#x27;ve stopped using all the other electronic tooth brushes I used before. This one is all I need. I credit this excellent result to moving the brush very slowly for about 2 minutes per quadrant, not the entire job, for a total of 8 minutes, twice daily.</li>
            <li> I got the Oral B Precision 1000 at Target.  It vibrates so much that I couldn&#x27;t stand brushing my teeth.  Had to take it back.</li>
            <li> Updated review with more detail to explain my 1 star opinion---&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I&#x27;ve shared in previous reviews for Oral-B electric toothbrush products, one of the Oral-B \\&quot;regular\\&quot; electric toothbrushes (similar to this ORAL-B PROFESSIONAL 1000) that I bought a few years ago made my teeth sensitive to the point of having pain. My dentist, who had recommended the Oral-B toothbrush in the first place, diagnosed the Oral-B electric toothbrush as being to blame for taking the enamel off my teeth. This was a temporary condition that resolved on its own once I discontinued its use per the dentist&#x27;s order. At that time under the dentist&#x27;s direction, I went back to using a Sonicare electric toothbrush. However not much later, Oral-B came out with their first \\&quot;SmartSeries\\&quot; which has a special sensor that monitors if the user is pressing too hard on the teeth--this is indicated by reading the signals on an LCD display. My dentist then recommended the SMARTSERIES model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband and two children have been using the [[ASIN:B002HWS9GG Oral-B Professional Care SmartSeries 5000 Rechargeable Toothbrush]] for a few years.  We own two units because my kids have their own bathroom. They all like the SMARTSERIES 5000. I like that it helps teach my children just how much pressure is enough and when it is too much. The dentist and I feel this helps prevent damage to their enamel due to erroneous use of too much pressure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ORAL-B 1000 PROFESSIONAL CARE electric toothbrush product which I tested for Amazon Vine claims to stop pulsing if too much pressure is put on the teeth. I cannot detect any difference in action no matter how hard I push against my teeth. I also tried pushing it against a fingertip and the palm of my hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In reading the directions in the box I got confused because the manufacturer is using one set of directions for multiple models of their toothbrushes but not being specific on the directions as to which model is in the box. I then turned to the box for a closer reading of exactly what the 1000 series could do. I found small writing on the back and one side to indicate this model has one mode brushing which they say is for daily use. In the direction packet it states other models have two modes, one for \\&quot;daily use\\&quot; and one for sensitive teeth that has less pressure. There is also a notation that some models have a tooth whitening feature (no model numbers are stated or I&#x27;d share them here).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This model comes with one regular brush head. By close reading of the direction packet I learned there is another model of head that is for sensitive teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are shopping for an electric toothbrush you need to know there are many options on the market, even with this latest series by Oral-B there are different models, some with more options than others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though my dentist has never given me a diagnosis of having \\&quot;sensitive teeth\\&quot; I don&#x27;t like the sensation of this 1000 series Oral-B toothbrush, it is very strong and since it doesn&#x27;t seem to stop any action no matter how much pressure I exert on it, I worry it is too rough on my teeth. I plan to stick to using my Sonicare. My husband and kids are happily still using their SMART SERIES with an LCD panel that tells them if they are pressing too hard.r reading of exactly what the 1000 series could do.

            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t rave about it because using their flossinator brushhead still doesn&#x27;t do an ideal job. Surface cleans the teeth but not between teeth. And when I say between the teeth I&#x27;m talking about the exposed portion that I feel a brush should get to. I brush at least 4-5 minutes. What is helpful is to purchase their power tip brush which is very narrow and allows you to target in between the teeth. I think it works as good as any automatic brush. I haven&#x27;t tried other brands so I can&#x27;t make a comparison. But I guess it cleans better than a regular toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Works fine with strong action. It does the job.  The flashing light is annoyingly bright and the battery seems to run down somewhat faster than the claimed 10 x 2 min brushings.</li>
            <li> When ordering this product, because I live in Australia and our voltage is 220 volt, I would have thought I would receive one suitable for our voltage but instead received 110 - 130 volt one (suitable for USA).  I sent this back, postage was $Aud30.00, and asked for a replacement and stating that I needed a 220 volt Oral B Professional Care 1000 Electric rechargeable power toothbrush.  I received the replacement and was sent exactly the same thing.  I will not be sending this back because it will again cost me $Aud30.00.  I was very unhappy as this is a present for someone.</li>
            <li> And it does not need to be plugged in all the time. A charge lasts about a week. It blinks RED at the bottom when it needs to be recharged so you do not have to leave the charger on the counter all the time.</li>
            <li> I forgot my other Oral-B in Europe, so I decided to just get a new one because my teeth just don&#x27;t feel healthy without an electronic toothbrush. The charger is really small and tucks away nicely and the toothbrush holds a really long charge. If you haven&#x27;t had an electronic toothbrush before, I highly recommend getting one. Your teeth will feel so much healthier!</li>
            <li> this slow cooker works great.  i really love the timer.  the unit is very light and the pottery is very heavy.  it is a good looking and good working slow cooker.</li>
            <li> great brush. great price. Just enough lights to let you know when to charge. Works great without a charge for a week. I&#x27;m impressed. I used the Oral-B Vitality brush until it died recently. This brush is even better!</li>
            <li> One thing I don&#x27;t like is to pay for \\&quot;bells &amp; whistles\\&quot; I won&#x27;t use.  My old oral B finally quit working so I considered the \\&quot;Sonicare\\&quot; and the Oral B models 1000-5000.  I found out that all except the Oral B 1000 cost more money and gave you (1) longer battery life  (2) the opportunity to see by graph the depletion of your battery&#x27;s charge (3) complicate your brushing by using multiple heads, whitening and perhaps other procedures.  I finally decided I didn&#x27;t want to add the higher end complexity to my oral hygene or pay the extra money.  Admittingly the UV sterialization of the head by Sonicare is a good thing but to me it was not worth the extra cost.  My wife &amp; I share the base and each keep out own heads.  She also using a flossing head and finds it highly effective.  We checked with our dental hygene rep who said the Oral-b is an excellent product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We have had our Oral-b 1000 for over a month and are very satisfied with the battery life.  The flashing read light after use indicates that charging is needed and we choose to deplete the battery before recharge although this is unnecessary for good battery life.  The brushing action is very good and better than our old brush.  Personally I don&#x27;t find the 30 second timer useful though this is good for those who brush in quadrants.  Overall I find the Oral-b 1000 to be a well made, simple to use, and effective electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Equivalent to the old model I still have for 12 years</li>
            <li> This is a great tooth brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really thought these electric tooth brush is really meant for the physically challenged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because they cant really move their hands easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But this does come as a surprise and leaves me with the squeaky clean feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looks cool&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;easy clean&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also comes with money back gaurantee.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What better way to stand behind your product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great brush.</li>
            <li> I have used a previous model Oral-B electric toothbrush, but this one is far superior.  The battery charge lasts about 10 days and the feeling of the brushing is great.</li>
            <li> In general a like very much this product. The only problem is that the charger is ONLY for 120 volts. Therefore, you can not use it on most of the countries. Personally, I do not understand this stupid limitation in the charger, because this is a European product and there most of the electronic stuffs like this are multivoltage.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this toothbrush. It takes a long time to charge but once it is charged it last all week.</li>
            <li> Works wonderfully. No issues</li>
            <li> My teeth are squeaky clean when I&#x27;m done brushing.  Used to use a Braun, switched to this one.  I actually spend less time brushing now and get better results.  Then again, the Braun model was ancient so it&#x27;s probably not a fair comparison.  Regardless, I like the brush, and more so really like the small footprint of the charger.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush was just what the wife was looking for.  Price and product were very good.  Shipping completed in a very timely manner.</li>
            <li> Not as pictured!! The storage base that shows room for 4 brush heads WAS NOT included. Do not post a picture that isn&#x27;t a proper representation of the actual product.</li>
            <li> I have been using Braun rechargeable toothbrushes for years and it was time to retire my old one.  Thanks to the great review by a person who actually made a video of the product I was sold.  I have no complaints.  It arrived in a short period of time and I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.  It is definitely a step up from my last Braun.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter who loves it! I have owned an older version of it for years that I also love. Still works great. Would definitely recommend the Oral-B Professional.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush does an excellent job in keeping your teeth clean. Original brush heads are expensive, but generic versions can be found less expensive at Amazon.</li>
            <li> works as expected -cleans very well--charging takes a bit long but plug it in overnight and it generally get full charge by morning</li>
            <li> Love this toothbrush!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok. Noisier and less engineered than previous models. No option to store other brush heads. battery doesn&#x27;t last long and Design is too bulky.</li>
            <li> Good version of tried and true product.  Let&#x27;s see how long the battery lasts.</li>
            <li> When my super duper Oral B outfit bit the dust and I had $40 dollars worth of replacement brushes languishing in the drawer, I looked for an economical replacement. It works like a charm.</li>
            <li> Nice, portable, easy to use toothbrush; battery last for a long time (about a week) . it is very thin so it can be easily packed  for traveling. fast delivery</li>
            <li> It pulses to let you know when to change the area of your mouth that youre brushing... I think this is annoying. I went back to a regular toothbrush.</li>
            <li> so far so good. the product is in good quality. I am satisfied with cleanness from the brushing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this toothbrush for about 3 months now, and I&#x27;m extremely happy with it.  I was initially worried about the small diameter of the brush heads, but the size turned out to be perfect and my teeth feel much cleaner after using this brush than they ever did with a manual.  I only wish that it came with a travel case like several of the store models do.</li>
            <li> fast service, great product at a great price.</li>
            <li> Great tooth brush. The timer is nice.</li>
            <li> Good toothbrush. No complaints. I really like the Charge indicator that reminds me to take it out of my shower and place it on the charger.</li>
            <li> A replacement for my previous model which ran faithfully for about four years. Does a better job than hand brushing. Considered a luxuary item due to price.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product through Amazon. There had been a Promotion advertised with it to give a $15.00 Rebate by mail. I sent in all the required documentation after receiving the Tooth Brush. Somewhat later, I received a letter that said &amp;#34;Your submission included receipt(s) showing discount(s) were received. This not acceptable for this offer.&amp;#34; What a deal!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband and he absolutely loves it. I want to trade him because I like the color of his better! I myself have a similar version of this same brush. We love to brush our teeth!</li>
            <li> I have used an Oral-B electric toothbrush since I was in my pre-teen years.  I have always had successful check-ups and the dentist always thinks my teeth are very clean.  It is a little investment upfront for the brush and to buy replacement brush heads (buy good-rated generic on Amazon) but the deep cleaning will definitely save you money in dental services!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other great thing about these Oral-B brushes is that they will last 5-7 years before the battery weakens noticeably in power.  I just replace the brush by then because they are continuously releasing better and more powerful models.</li>
            <li> Maybe some people need reminders about when to move from tooth to tooth. But if you are looking for a great electric toothbrush, this is it.  I would suggest having 2, as they take 16 hours to charge--or just have a manual brush,too.  Since I have been using Oral B electric toothbrushes for several years now, my dental checkups have been much better.  I used to have a lot of plaque; now there is almost none.  My gums are in great shape.  The bottom line is that it does a better job than you can do yourself, and your teeth are worth the investment.</li>
            <li> I like Oral B, and this is a fine model to get, but I found soon after getting it that local retailers had it for the same price or cheaper, and I could also find coupons with some regularity. Chalk it up to an impulse buy, me and my weird Canadian Oral-B PRO are still much better off than we were before.</li>
            <li> This is a must have. Only down side charging takes a day</li>
            <li> Only reason it&#x27;s not five star is I&#x27;m used to a larger brush head but slowly getting used too it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best toothbrush I&#x27;ve owned. The brush head is very easy to remove. I like the vibrations to let me know it&#x27;s time to change quadrants. I really like knowing I have a variety of heads to choose from. I&#x27;m not stuck with the kind that came with it.</li>
            <li> I always thought that no electric toothbrush would clean my teeth any better than good old fashioned brushing, but I was totally wrong.  I think EVERYONE should use this toothbrush.  It&#x27;s wonderful.</li>
            <li> I used an Braun Oral B that lasted 25 years. Naturally I bought another one when it quit working, that is the battery would no  longer hold a charge. The new one arrived quickly, thank you Amazon Prime, But, after 24 hours it would only run about 15 seconds, I left it on the charger another 24 hours, again 10 or 15 seconds. Had to send it back. I might ad that Amazon&#x27;s return policy is very easy and good. Happy with Amazon, not happy with new Oral-B. The old one was fantastic, I don&#x27;t know what happened to them over the last 25 years.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s o.k. but you&#x27;ve never seen anything like the mess i get in when using it - the mirror, too!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve worked in dental offices for 21 years.  We all know that Oral-B is top-notch!  When my old Oral-B electric toothbrush died, I had to order a new one ASAP because brushing with a regular toothbrush left my teeth feeling less than clean.  This newer model is lighter to hold &amp; takes up less room.</li>
            <li> In my opinion this is the better of the two Oral-B and the other more expensive Sonicare. I have used this Oral-B for several years.</li>
            <li> I have used the new electrical toothbrush for about a month now and I&#x27;m very pleased.  The unit charged well and stays charged for along time.  It is doing a great job cleaning my teeth and is a big improvement over my prior electrical toothbrush.  I would recommend this unit to anybody in the market for an electrical toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I purchase this as replacement because&lt;br /&gt;my old one was broken after 5 years.&lt;br /&gt;It works very well, and I count on it on every&lt;br /&gt;day now.</li>
            <li> I bought this to keep my teeth well cleaned and to get healthier gums. It does a great job. There is a small glitch to it. it has a hesitation to it, leading you to believe the item is defective. i returned it and recieved a second one. The second one did the same thing, a hesitation. but other than that it gets the job done. i kept it. So far so good. oh, and my teeth? They sure are pretty. hee hee hee</li>
            <li> I bought this brush to replace a similar Professional Care model that lasted over 7 years of twice a day use.  I love this brush and would recommend it.  Teeth stay much cleaner than with regular brushing; almost like going to a dentist every day</li>
            <li> I bought two of these for my wife and myself. While they are most definitely better than any standard toothbrush, I find that I miss my old Sonicare. It could be that I am just used to the strength and feel of Sonicare, but this brush is quite a bit less powerful. This would be great for those people with sensitive gums who need to slowly work up to something more powerful, but for those of you who already owned an electric toothbrush I would get one a little more powerful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I really enjoy the feeling of the brush head on my gums and teeth. The swirly, vibrating head cleans great and massages the gums very well. So overall, I do recommend this brush as it does seem to clean well.</li>
            <li> This is my first electric toothbrush. I wanted to get one because I felt like my manual couldn&#x27;t get my teeth as clean as I wanted, and my dental hygenist said that I had plaque around my gumline. This toothbrush definitely takes care of that problem. I think it might be slightly too powerful, but I&#x27;d rather go a little over the top than not powerful enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like how the head is small and you can pinpoint on locations around your mouth, except that I feel that it doesn&#x27;t hold enough toothpaste. Other reviews have said that they like how you \\&quot;don&#x27;t need to use as much toothpaste,\\&quot; but I think you don&#x27;t use enough. I put toothpaste on it for one side of my mouth, and then stop and reload halfway through for the other half. It&#x27;s inconvenient, but otherwise I feel like half my mouth gets jipped on the toothpaste and doesn&#x27;t get as clean.&lt;br /&gt;Another con that someone else mentioned--this toothbrush makes it almost impossible to keep from drooling all over. I have to lean over the sink in case I drool and usually stop one once or twice to spit while brushing to prevent it from dripping out of my mouth or ending up with a blue waterfall over my chin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like how this toothbrush charges. When it&#x27;s low the light turns red, when it&#x27;s charging it blinks green, and when it&#x27;s done charging it goes blank. Easy peasy. I also never felt the toothbrush losing power or become weaker when the red light came on to tell me to charge it.</li>
            <li> Returned - not as expected</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how it got so many good reviews honestly. Coz I&#x27;ve used electronic brushes before and this one is simply not comfortable to use. The vibration is too strong that it hurt my gum the first time I used it.</li>
            <li> No good.the mother is not strong.</li>
            <li> I bought two \\&quot;Oral-B Professional Care 1000 Electric Rechargeable Power Toothbrush 1 Count\\&quot;, but I just received one reward card, could you explain it, thanks.</li>
            <li> Do&#x27;s a very thourgh job of cleaning,but extremely messy.I use it over my laundry sink.&lt;br /&gt;Could have bought it for $20 less on sale at Walgreens with coupon.You don&#x27;t always get the best deal on Amazon</li>
            <li> Compact with speed about equal to a Crest Spinbrush.  Uses same brushes as my other Oral-B. Has a small charger and battery is replaceable.  Only negative is doesn&#x27;t come with travel case or cover for brush.</li>
            <li> Cleans my teeth way better especially when my grip isn&#x27;t that good in the morning.</li>
            <li> The 1000 is the best value in the Oral B line I think. Wife has the 5000 and it cost a few times more, and we don&#x27;t care for the added features like bluetooth or use the other modes. I would give the Phillips a try next time, as I am not in love with the cleaning I get from the Oral-B ones.</li>
            <li> Nice but they get you on the replacement heads</li>
            <li> Previously a devout Sonicare user, my husband convinced me to try an Oral-B instead.  This toothbrush is very loud and has a strong vibration that borders on uncomfortable to use.  I&#x27;d probably give it two stars for the toothbrush alone, but the one-star rating is because of the fact that the $15 rebate offer was declined, reportedly because the original UPC was not included.  However, I distinctly recall cutting the UPCs out and mailing them in with the rebate information.  We purchased two at the time, so lost out on $30 worth of rebate.  There is not even a contact number for the Fulfillment Center on the letter declining the rebate.</li>
            <li> This definitely leaves my teeth feeling A LOT cleaner than when using a regular toothbrush.  I like it so much I bought one for my husband and another for my son.</li>
            <li> Had a variety of OralB toothbrushes over the years and my general opinion is they are not what they used to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This unit is loud and has a huge amount of vibration.  It feels like a disposable+ kinda of product .. means to last a little while but not particularly long.  Should have taken care of my older units as I feel their build quality used to be much higher.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3 stars since they still clean teeth.</li>
            <li> Like it a lot!  Does everything I expected of it.</li>
            <li> Battery life not as long as I would expect..needs charging every 3-4 days. I like the high speed of the brush and seems to clean well.</li>
            <li> It works pretty well, it holds a good charge, and also cleans my teeth well, what more could you want?</li>
            <li> EXCELLENT!  My teeth have never felt so clean or looked as white. The head that comes with the toothbrush works ok, but I suggest you buy the &amp;#34;Prowhite&amp;#34; heads as they are far and away better than the generic head.</li>
            <li> I ordered this particular toothbrush to replace one of the same description that finally quit working after 14 years of daily use.  My dentist originally suggested this and I figured he ought to lnow.</li>
            <li> This is a upgrade from a Oral-B older version. IT is amazing difference for us that I got another one. We now have two for our family.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Works flawlessly and the timers on it makes it easier for my kids to understand how long they need to brush.</li>
            <li> The Oral-B Professional 1000 is very useful, and I am thinking about getting a newer generation. And it is posted fast.</li>
            <li> I used an older model and upgraded to the current model.  I was astonished with the speed/power of the new toothbrush.  Glad I got a new one.</li>
            <li> The product worked great as promised, shipped promptly and recieved as promised. I really line it and would recommend it to anyone in the market for this type of product.</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with my tooth brush.</li>
            <li> I find that these last about 3 years, after which time the battery holds less and less charge. A very good toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend using &amp;#34;soft/gentle&amp;#34; brushes, not standard ones, to avoid gum damage.&lt;br /&gt;Oral: in this day and age, it&#x27;s time you made a universal 100/240 volt charger.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, slim to hold, waterproof to be placed in the bathroom; and it pauses automatically when I press it heavily upon a tooth</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended I purchase this tooth brush and after using it for about a month, I can understand why.  Simply put, it does a better job at cleaning my teeth than a standard tooth brush.  I recommend using the floss action brush head.</li>
            <li> So I investigated and investigated whether to get an oral B/Braun or Sonic Care toothbruch...after days of research and asking my dentist I went with the oral B.  I was going to get the sonic care...as they seemed to be a great deal here on amazon, but the one flaw being they get real nastee where to brush attaches (see reviews for the entry level sonic care for details)....Really the main reason I didn&#x27;t get the sonic care is because I was charged tax and it was $5 more....so I cancelled it and ordered this....so far I&#x27;ve only used the precision head which I do like...I can tell a difference between this and a regular brush, my teeth are squeaky clean, but I&#x27;ve not made it to my dentist to see if the claims are true of reversing periodontal disease...I just started showing signs of it so hopefully it does...the timer does work, but IT ONLY HAS ONE SPEED!&lt;br /&gt;Anyhow, I think I&#x27;m going to buy some different heads to add to my collection and stick with this until it dies..it is definitely easier on the arm than normal brushing, although I am somewhat anal when it comes to brushing...I still brush more than the recomended 2 mins so the timer doesn&#x27;t really do a lot of good although I do like having it so I know that I&#x27;ve done due diligence in getting my mouth clean.  I would&#x27;ve gave it 5 stars except for the lies!  Also it states it has an auto stop if you push too hard...even states it on the box...I can&#x27;t really tell that it works...if it does it useless....although I think we all know if we are brushing too hard so no big deal.&lt;br /&gt;Also, it says it may make your gums bleed at first...well let me tell you mine didn&#x27;t bleed...not at all...actually they bleed less with this than they did with a brush so I wouldn&#x27;t be too worried about that...also the speed it uses seems fine...I don&#x27;t know why someone would want all the extra speeds of the upper level models.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is wonderful.  My previous ORAL B gave up after many years of use.  They both have two minute timers, but this new one lets me know when 30 seconds have passed, making brushing each quadrant very easy.  It&#x27;s easy on the gums, too.  Love it!</li>
            <li> Purchased to replace a 4+ year old Oral-B Professional series. Great updates in this generation. It feels stronger, the 3D effect is more comfortable, along with the 30 second timer steps. Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush!  With the freshest of breaths, I had the confidence to propose to my girlfriend of 2 months.  She said yes and we just had 7 sons within the span of 2 years.  We are going to start our own basketball team and try to compete against the other families that have done the same.  I received a promotion because my boss thought my fresh smile would increase work productivity, which it has!  My only problem with the toothbrush is the battery life.  I brush my teeth 18 times a day, 2 hours each session, and I can&#x27;t seem to keep a charge to keep my breath as phresh as possible.  Thanks Oral-B Professional Healthy Clean Precision 1000 Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush!</li>
            <li> This toothbrush works very well for the money. I would recommend investing in it over one of the cheaper &amp;#34;disposable&amp;#34; battery powered tooth brushes. Using generic brush replacements has not been an issue.</li>
            <li> I searched online for the best electronic toothbrush.  It turns out, the style of this toothbrush has been found by Cochrane to be the only type of electronic toothbrush that outperforms manual toothbrushes when used as directed. Cochrane does meta-analyses and they are very conservative, which means that when they say something, it is pretty much true.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t completely agree with their methodology -- one benefit of using electronic toothbrushes is that people spend more time brushing their teeth with electronic toothbrushes than with manual toothbrushes, so there&#x27;s a decent chance that other electronic toothbrushes might, in the real world, outperform manual toothbrushes.  However, their meta-analysis was toothbrushes, used as directed, and with that context, I believe them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Independent of my prompting, my dentist also recommended this very toothbrush, reinforcing my belief in its goodness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one annoyance is that the internals of the toothbrush drain down, which creates a gunky toothpastey sludge at the base of the charger.  The solution is to take the head out of the base after you&#x27;re done brushing.  That&#x27;s annoying, but it eliminates the gunk problem.</li>
            <li> this brush is good. my dentist said my teeth look better after using it. It works. Pros: small footprint, makes mouth feel clean. Cons: long time to recharge, like 24 - 48 hours.</li>
            <li> I adore my Oral-B toothbrush.  It&#x27;s quiet, it thoroughly cleans between tooth spaces, and it keeps charged forever.  I prefer the Oral-B to any other brand of electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Well written, outstanding book.  The author is truly bold in Christ.......using God&#x27;s opinion.....not his own, for the foundation of this book. He understands what is happening on the political scene and how it is affecting the American majority.  I have bought the book for others and they have enjoyed it as well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;V. Roland</li>
            <li> This toothbrush works really well. After I use it my teeth feel nice and clean. The tooth brush on the charger is nice and slim and does not take up much space. I would recommend this tooth brush over a manual toothbrush as it definitely does a better job. It is not that expensive and there is a $20 mail in rebate till Christmas so this is your chance to own a great electrical toothbrush for  cheap!</li>
            <li> Still the best toothbrush.  Simple, silent, effective.</li>
            <li> Multiple brush heads and sturdy construction makes this a good buy. Ours is three years old and going strong</li>
            <li> Nice,  effective cleaning of the teeth, and removal of plaque, leaves a sensation fresh and clean</li>
            <li> All oral b pro toothbrushes are great!</li>
            <li> The overall quality of the merchandise and the way it works for myself  is why chose that rating.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush for the money!  I would recommend to anyone.  I used an Amazon coupon for 10 off and there was a rebate for another 20 off so I got this for only $18.  Great deal.</li>
            <li> great feature set, great battery life. has a 30 second notification (head turns on and off a few times) so you can brush each quadrant evenly. after two minutes it gives you a nice notification.</li>
            <li> I had the cheap version before.  It lasted 6 years or so.  It was easy to order another.  I ordered the 1000 as it was the lowest level of the high powered models.  This sucker is like going to the dentist.  Very powerful.  I ordered some extra brushes and my 5 yr old loves to use &#x27;daddy&#x27;s tooth brush now.</li>
            <li> Would never go back to a basic toothbrush!  I &#x27;v been using the Oral-B for15 years now.  Replacement heads are well worth the cost. If you love an after the dentist cleaning, you will get it with this product.</li>
            <li> I have been a big fan of electric toothbrushes for years.  I bought this one because it is a single.  I didn&#x27;t want to pay for more than one brush head.  Plus, my dentist recommends this brand.</li>
            <li> excellent product, fast shipping</li>
            <li> I love this tooth brush.  I brought one about six months ago and now purchased one for my husband.  He is very happy with it.</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush, just wish they were cheaper</li>
            <li> My dental hygienist recommended this for my 6 and 9 year old kids. The kids like it, and it works well for smaller mouths. However, I would not recommend it for kids under 6 as I am not sure it would be small enough for their mouths. The 30 second vibration marker is a nice way for the kids to keep track of time brushing. It only needs to be charged once per week, which is great for kids! We leave it unplugged except on the night we are charging--safer and saves electricity.</li>
            <li> The Oral B is just what I wanted after years of using another model...This answers my desire for a toothbrush that is easy to use,takes little room on my counter-top and is easily rinsed, towel dried and replaced in short order...I would highly recommend it for everyone..This is a good product to pack when traveling...takes up little space...Best of all, you know your teeth are clean and you feel great.</li>
            <li> Works well and as described, no complaints.</li>
            <li> my teeth have an all new kind of clean feeling. I am not crazy about the pulses every 30 seconds but it&#x27;s tolerable. I use the circular spin brush and I like how it can get into all the nooks and crannies.</li>
            <li> I have been an Oral B user for years. I believe the model I was using was a more expensive version of the product. This model seems cheap and cuts out (freezes) when I use it. It has had problems from the day I bought it. Only been using it for about 2 months but wondering when I will be replacing it.</li>
            <li> When I began to receive a fully charged with the electric toothbrush is very clean, very comfortable, and the price is very cheap, very grateful, I really like it.</li>
            <li> It come on time.  It work.  Disappointed that it only come with 1 brush head though.&lt;br /&gt;If the head wasn&#x27;t too expensive, it would have been better.</li>
            <li> Very useful and easy to use!</li>
            <li> My teeth feel really clean after using this device and the plaque along my gum line is nearly gone after just a couple weeks.  My Sonic Care wasn’t able to get the job done after many years of use.  Not much of a surprise however, as the cleaning action of the Oral B is much more vigorous and intense.  One small gripe, the on/off button is kind of hard to find by touch.</li>
            <li> Great brush. Works well. Easy to charge. I like the 2 minute timer with 30 second intervals. Expensive though compared to UK prices!</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush! I have problem gums and this toothbrush does a thorough job w/out being&lt;br /&gt;too hard.  I had a great check up last week....Love Oral B!</li>
            <li> Update 11/08/12: After more than 9 months of use, I now have to charge it after about 1 week of brushing for 2-3 min 2-3 times a day, but that&#x27;s how long the manual says it should last anyway. I still love how well it cleans my teeth. I feel like I get the best results when using [[ASIN:B000AUIFCA Oral B Floss Action 3 pack brush head refill]].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I previously used a Sonicare Elite that stopped holding a charge for more than a minute after a couple months of use. I&#x27;ve had this one for about 3 months and I&#x27;ve only had to charge it about once every 1.5 - 2 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Long battery life&lt;br /&gt;30 second quadrant timing&lt;br /&gt;Light weight&lt;br /&gt;Stays on after 2 minutes so you can continue brushing if you want&lt;br /&gt;Cleans teeth well&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s a hole in the back of the brush head that allows fluids in. Doesn&#x27;t seem to sanitary to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Notes: If you&#x27;re using an electric toothbrush for the first time or after a long time, your gums will probably bleed. This is normal and happens with all electric toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> I really like this toothbrush.  I had my old Braun/oralB for many years and it finally stopped charging.  I had many of the brush heads left so I decided to get this one so that I can use them up. Works well.</li>
            <li> I feel the electric toothbrush cleans my teeth much better than standard brushing.  I recommend it to everyone.  It&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
            <li> This was my mistake. It was plugged into a switched outlet and I didn&#x27;t notice that the switch was turned off! It works just fine when it&#x27;s been charged up, stupid mistake on my part!!</li>
            <li> I got two of these for my kids on the recommendation of our dentist. I have also been using an Oral-B for years and like them a lot. The heads are nice and small for kids&#x27; mouths and the built in timer is very handy. Previously we had been buying the disposable battery-operated brushes for them at the grocery store, but these were a great investment.</li>
            <li> I have been using an Oral B Triumph for about 2 years.  It&#x27;s an amazing brush and my teeth feel incredibly clean after I brush with it.  Rechargeable battery life is impressive.  I have to say that this particular brush is more of the same....2 minute timer, battery life light, that&#x27;s about it.  So it&#x27;s a great brush, I just have no idea why they have come out with a new model!</li>
            <li> My wife always says I brush too hard since my toothbrush heads wear out twice as fast as hers.  When we got this, she thought that I&#x27;d finally learn that I was indeed brushing too hard.  Well, either that particular feature is not working on this Oral B toothbrush, or I am brushing with the right pressure.  I did try to really press down hard on it and it never did shut off.  So I&#x27;m thinking I might have one where that feature isn&#x27;t working.  However, reading the other reviews, it sounds like others have gotten it to work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, this is a really great toothbrush.  My teeth feel especially clean when I go through the whole 2 min routine.  The toothbrush pulsates every 30 seconds to let you know it is time to move to a different quadrant of the mouth.  Without that, I&#x27;m sure my brushing would only take me about 80-90 seconds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The charger is small and compact: it won&#x27;t take much space up on your counter.  I used to have an older model that had a wall mount kit.  This does not have that, but that&#x27;s no big deal for me.  The booklet says the charge should last a week.  This is a factor for me, since my bathroom doesn&#x27;t have a convenient outlet for keeping this on the charger every night, so I have the charger in another room and only charge the unit when it needs it.  In actuality, the red \\&quot;needs a charge\\&quot; light comes on probably about every 4 days (probably because I put too much pressure on my teeth).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, great toothbrush, with the best feature being the timed brushing cycle to ensure a really thorough job.</li>
            <li> Oral-B was offering a 50% rebate on all of its power toothbrushes so I figured this was a great chance to try out an alternative to the Sonicare toothbrush I had been using. Even without the 50% rebate the cost of the Oral-B models are lower than the Sonicare models. After doing quite a bit of research I also found that the only differences between the Professional Care 1000 and higher models like the 4000 and 5000 are the number of brush modes and unnecessary add-ons like timers and displays on the toothbrush itself. If your teeth are used to a good scrubbing there is no need to even use anything other than the standard brush mode.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After about a week of use I found myself really missing the Sonicare technology. I didn&#x27;t feel like the spinning bristles of the Oral-B were cleaning my teeth as well as the vibrating/pulsing bristles of the Sonicare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oral-B used to make a sonic toothbrush called the Sonic Complete which still remains the best toothbrush I&#x27;ve owned. Unfortunately these spinning bristle models don&#x27;t really do it for me and if you&#x27;re used to sonic technology you will likely be as disappointed as I was.</li>
            <li> I like the Oral-b 1000 toothbrush.  It does not seem to work any better than the less expensive Oral-b toothbrushes I have used in the past.  The thing that I don&#x27;t like is that the recharging light flashes while charging and really catches your attention at night when you get up to use the bathroom.  I would probably look for a cheaper model Oral-b.  Seems to hold its charge for about week but when the battery goes it is gone and you might have to finish with a manual toothbrush for that night.  It has a light to let you know when to recharge but I ignore it until it gives out of power.  It seems to run at a high speed all the way up until it stops, and that is good.  I do not keep my Oral-b plugged in all the time and only plug it in when it needs a charge. I like the old Oral-b that would pulse to let you know that the two minutes were up.  This model also has the two minute pulse alert but it has two additional ones at about 45 second intervals but are less intense than the two minute alert.  It has so many alerts that you start to ignore them and might miss the two minute alert.</li>
            <li> I like this toothbrush very much, it does an excellent job of brushing, holds a charge good and is light weight and easy to use. I would reccomend to anyone. As usual Amazon&#x27;s service was fast.</li>
            <li> THIS IS THE ABSOLUTE BEST BRUSH IV USED.  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT TO ANYONE WHO REALLY WANTS CLEAN TEETH.</li>
            <li> I upgraded to this model from my old Oral-B and it is MUCH better than my old one.  My teeth feel more like after a dental cleaning now after using it.</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush. The 30 second timer for each part of your mouth is very helpful. It makes me realize that I have not been spending enough time brushing. The charge lasts for a whole week so you can bring the brush/handle part with you for a few days of travel w/out having to pack the charger. The handle part is slimmer than in the past and is easy to move around the mouth. In general, a very wonderful appliance to have.</li>
            <li> Best toothbrush, easy to charge, corded base.</li>
            <li> Holds a charge well, seems quite effective, but super loud.</li>
            <li> Excellent power brush. Really deep cleans, and works great.  I&#x27;ve been using electric tooth brushes for the past 20 years.&lt;br /&gt;This is the best one so far and at $50.00 makes it just about perfect.  Use as directed and you&#x27;ll never have cavities. You will have beautiful sparkling, perfectly cleaned teeth&#x27;.... Highly recommend&#x27;</li>
            <li> This toothbrush has saved my gums and prevented many cavities.&lt;br /&gt;Since I use this toothbrush I have much less inflammation of the gums and I only got 1 cavity (while I used to have more frequently). It does a great job and holds the charge well (I went on a 3-week trip on 1 charge and my toothbrush is now 2 years old).&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend replacing the default toothbrush head provided (small circle) to the dual clean head. Why limit yourself to a small work surface when the bigger head can take double?</li>
            <li> Read the reviews and was torn but this is a great toothbrush.  Yes it is loud but you feel like you&#x27;re doing something.  Easy to hear/feel reminders to move to new area.  Charge lasts a long time.  I wouldn&#x27;t go back to a normal toothbrush.  Dentist recommended by the way.</li>
            <li> I have had this baby 1 week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plaque gone, slight gum bleeding gone, dentist fresh vibe after each brushing,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Awesome charge hold, Amazing effectiveness, but DO&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOT&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SKIP&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DAMNED&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Read me stuff ! Please read the booklet. Please learn the right way to get the most of this Braun. You learn a ton.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had a bit of a creeping up gingivitis situation evolving or emerging. I actually do the floss thing and do the dentist thing, haters!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product cured my slight bleeding at brushing time. You are advised to work the tooth sides, tops, and the gums. Do these things, gargle with cheap H2O2 from the pharmacy (peroxide) and voila. Happy healthy choppers with a normal colored white smile-- not psycho white like the news readers or club floozies ...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great clean white healthy happy teeth are the final analysis, bottom line, end result, and sum total of reading and heeding the previous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Off you go. Get healthy. Rotten teeth actually kill via heart disease, fellow comrade mortals. Get educated.</li>
            <li> I like the light weight easy to handle slender brush . It&#x27;s small rotor heads really covers each tooth. It&#x27;s far better than its rival. Quite happy!</li>
            <li> This is a replacement brush for one that I had bought in Germany over twenty years ago.  It great though a bit more noisy than the one that I had.</li>
            <li> poorly made and the customer service is horrible and unresponsive. purchase a different brand! i will never buy anything from this horrible company again.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace an Oral-B that I&#x27;ve had for about ten years. No complaints about that one. THIS one, however, fails the battery test big time. It says you can brush twice a day for two weeks on a single charge. NOT SO. Three days is more like it. And now the \\&quot;RECHARGE\\&quot; light blinks after every use. Well worth sending back.</li>
            <li> This is truly a waste of money. It takes forever to charge, does not work well. I gave it to Goodwill.</li>
            <li> This item has not worked properly since the day I received it.  it will not hold a charge.  it has been a disappointment.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone through two Sonicare brushes.  They both failed after about a year, but maybe that&#x27;s normal.  I found them to be noisy and felt very rough in my mouth...sort of like an attack on my teeth and gums.  So, when I needed a new brush, I reviewed the data on both the Phillips and the Oral B, and liked the sound of the Oral B reviews.  I both this least expensive version and I LOVE it.  Less noise and easier on my mouth.</li>
            <li> My old toothbrush died so I bought a new one exactly like the old one and am very happy with it.</li>
            <li> Great product exceeded my expectations bought for my wife she loves it .</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this toothbrush! I have always been big on dental care and brush my teeth more than 2x a day and was glad when I received this as a christmas present! There really is no competition with manual and electric toothbrushes. I think electric wins hands down. I don&#x27;t find myself vigorously moving my arms to brush my teeth as I did with a manual toothbrush, instead I just calmly put this against my mouth and slowly move from side to side. I also love how it oscillates and the 2-minute timer on it with 30-second reminders to move to a different area of my mouth. It&#x27;s great! Oh, and it really does remove surface stains on the teeth. I drink 2 cups of tea every morning and brush my teeth before I leave the house and would see the tea stains being removed as I rinse my mouth in the sink! Amazing!</li>
            <li> This is my first electronic toothbrush so I don&#x27;t have much to compare it to, but I really like it. I bought it after my dentist suggested an electric toothbrush and I tried to find one at the intersection of economy and utility. I can tell from my rinses that this thing really works a lot better than manual toothbrushes. My teeth feel cleaner longer and my breath is better, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt;My hygienist actually said (without prompting) that she noticed a difference in the tarter buildup on my teeth after using this brush for a year. She also said my gums were in much better shape, so it definitely works!</li>
            <li> Talk about perfectly clean. I&#x27;m a mom on the run and don&#x27;t always have a lot of time to really brush well. This has helped me have very clean teeth even though I brush in a rush.</li>
            <li> The product information on Amazon is incorrect.  This product can not use all the different brush heads, as stated above.  Specifically, it cannot use the Ortho head, though it specifically states in the product info this is one that can be used.  OralB&#x27;s website says the same thing, but the packaging on both the toothbrush and the Ortho replacement head specifically say they are not compatible.  I called OralB and their automated information confirmed the info on the packaging, these two are not compatible.  Ugh...now I&#x27;ve got to go to the hassle of doing a return...</li>
            <li> I like the 2 minute timer. It keeps me accountable. I didnt think that i would b e using that feature, but it is really becoming part of my morning routine (and brushing will take another 2 minutes, so I have x amount of minutes left to get out the door).</li>
            <li> Another great product purchased from Amazon.</li>
            <li> Unit seems well built, feels solid and of good quality materials.  I am giving it only 3 stars because the one I received is missing the brush storage base - which is the reason I bought it in the first place.  My kids will use it and I need for them to be able to store two brush heads.  The picture on Amazon&#x27;s web site shows the unit with a storage base, but I only got the round charging base.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t have multi speed as it says on box</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is the best one I&#x27;ve ever had. It is far superior than the other brands I&#x27;ve owned over the years.</li>
            <li> Great product at great price.</li>
            <li> Does the job and is a quality product. Would purchase again.</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush! I&#x27;ve been using Oral B Electric Toothbrushes for as long as they were available until my pervious dentist suggested a Phillips Sonicare Electric Toothbrush. I was sorry I listened to his advice &amp; switched to Phillips Sonicare.  That was a big mistake, I&#x27;ve been having problems ever since before switching back to Oral B.  I have a severe gag reflex &amp; prefer the small brush heads. I was a heavy soda drinker and I love sweets.  One day I went to the dentist complaining that my teeth hurt.  It turned out I had a lot of Cavities. My pervious Dentist suggested the Phillips Sonicare toothbrush, so I bought that electric toothbrush. I hated it. It wasn&#x27;t the right toothbrush for me. The brush head was so big, I was gaging when I tired to brush in the back. I felt like I was going to be sick when I used the Sonicare toothbrush and I would stop using it after 1 minute of using it every day &amp; night. That led to a bad case of gingivitis, which he wanted to fix. He always tired to get me to come in for a cleaning every 3 months instead of every 6 months. I didn&#x27;t want to do that because I couldn&#x27;t afford it &amp; I always believed 2 times a year was enough.  I didn&#x27;t want him to fix the gingivitis, I just wanted to walkout of his office. After that dentist appointment I wanted to go back to Oral B.  I throw away the Phillips Sonicare toothbrush &amp; I bought this electric toothbrush. I also switched to Crest Pro Health Toothpaste. I love that it has a small brush head. I can get to the back teeth easily without gaging myself.  It&#x27;s not a harsh head either. It feels very comfortable. Before when I was using the Phillips Sonicare Toothbrush, I could only stand to brush my teeth for 1 minute day &amp; night before my gag reflex started acting up. With the Oral B toothbrush I can brush my teeth for the suggested 3-5 minutes amount without any gaging. I recently moved to a different state &amp; I have a new dentist now.  Before moving, I didn&#x27;t go to the dentist for a year &amp; a half.  When I sat in the chair &amp; opened my mouth, the hygienist immediately said that I did a great job brushing my teeth &amp; she couldn&#x27;t believe that I could get to the back teeth so easily.  That was a great complement to me. I felt so proud of myself. Even the dentist told me that I did a great job brushing my teeth &amp; he told me to keep up the good work!  I will never go back to Phillips Sonicare.  It might be a great toothbrush for a lot of people, but not for me.  Thanks Oral B. I didn&#x27;t think I would have a great checkup ever! Oral B &amp; Crest Pro Health is a great combination! My mouth feels very clean &amp; fresh! Just cutting the soda &amp; sweets down helped a lot to! But, I owe everything to the Oral B Toothbrush! What a great product!a half.

            <li> Works exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t be happier.  It was/is the toothbrush I was looking for.  It arrived sooner than I expected.</li>
            <li> The stress of a tough year is starting to get to me. I&#x27;ve been puckered up so tight for so long, I&#x27;m afraid my puckerer may have frozen that way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I&#x27;ve been searching for inner peace -- and outer unpuckering -- in personal relaxation products. But expensive gadgets and doodads would just angry my blood up further, so I&#x27;m seeking Samadhi on a shoestring budget.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Those vibrating chairs and pillows and personal massage doohickeys look pretty inviting -- but they&#x27;re always so expensive. I figured it&#x27;s the wiggling that does all of the work, so why not use a vibrating toothbrush to gently caress out my cares? Oral-B, take me away!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside is that the head on this brush is rather small, so it takes quite a bit of rubbing on my neck, temples or back to have any real impact. And by the time I&#x27;ve worked out a big knot between my shoulder blades, say, I&#x27;ve created an even bigger one from holding the toothbrush in one place for so long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If this came with some sort of clamp, or maybe a person to hold the brush for you, then it would be a nice massage tool for people. In the meantime, it&#x27;s the perfect size to provide tension relief to my pet hamster. Mr. Nippers really seems to like our massage sessions. And his wheel running has been much looser and easy-going since we started. Nice product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll have to admit this is my first Oral-b ever since I started using an electric toothbrush and I am completely loving it! I decided on an Oral-b when my Sonicare started to give me trouble after 9 faithful years of use. Don&#x27;t get me wrong this doesn&#x27;t mean that Oral-b is better than Sonicare, it just means I prefer the Oral-b more. After using the Oral-b for a week I can honestly say it beats the Sonicare (the Elite/Essence model) in 2 key areas, its precision and the maintenance. The Oral-b&#x27;s head is specifically designed to be round and small allowing users to clean each individual tooth while the structural design allow for simple and easy clean up. All you have to do to clean the unit is pull the head attachment off, rinse with water, and wipe clean with a towel or napkin. My old Sonicare, Elite model not flexcare, replacement heads was twisted on similar to a cup. This was extremely painful to clean because I would have to twist the head off, pop out the brush head, clean the round base, and then clean the handle mouth. If I didn&#x27;t do this after each use the tooth paste drip off while brushing will seep inside the brush unit and the handle unit turning into mold. Completely unsanitary! Even after purchasing the SonicSeal, which I highly suggest to anyone who has the Elite/Essence model, mold would still build up at the bottom of the SonicSeal/Sonicare handle without proper cleaning. I also didn&#x27;t feel like I had much precision cleaning my teeth because the brush head is long and wide. I always had to awkwardly position the brush to clean the inside of my teeth, the outer portion is really easy though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beside these 2 factors, I think both toothbrush does a great job at cleaning your teeth, one just requires more work. I never really bought into the whole Oral-b vs. Sonicare debate because technically any electric toothbrush is better than a manual one. I get the same squeaky clean fresh feeling after I brush using either the Oral-b or Sonicare. Like I mentioned earlier, neither toothbrush is better than the other at cleaning your teeth, it&#x27;s just the Oral-b gives you better precision and is easier to maintain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some miscellaneous difference between the Oral-b and Sonicare (Elite model):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. The Oral-b works by oscillating (moving side by side), so there is no need to brush when its on just move it tooth to tooth. The Sonicare uses sonic technology by vibrating, so brushing is required when the unit is on or it won&#x27;t clean at all just vibrates based on my experiences.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. The Oral-b has a quadrant timer just like the Sonicare. They will both pause after each 30 seconds indicating when to change quadrant, but unlike the Sonicare which stops automatically after 2 mins the Oral-b will continue on until prompted by the user to stop. I love this because I brush for 3 mins not 2.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. The charge indicator is different for both units. The Sonicare will blink green when charging and stay green when fully charged until removed from the charging base. The Oral-b will blink green when charging and stop blinking when fully charged. I had to pull out the manual to make sure the Oral-b was fully charged and working. I thought it malfunctioned because the light stayed off.I mentioned earlier, neither toothbrush is better than the other at cleaning your teeth, it&#x27;s just the Oral-b gives you better precision and is easier to maintain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some miscellaneous difference between the Oral-b and Sonicare (Elite model):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.

            <li> Works great! Internal timer vibrates at 15 sec. intervals to help complete a recommended 2-minute brushing. Got this one for college-bound son. Works very well around braces, too!</li>
            <li> Got rid of our sonic toothbrushes partly because I am grossed out by how dirty/moldy they get. I know we can take them apart and run them through the top of the D/W, but still.  The replacement brushes also get expensive.  Researched this Prof Care 1000 series and bought 2, for a total of @$90 which is a great deal.  At Fred Meyer they are $70 each.  I LOVE this toothbrush!  With the first use my teeth felt like I just left the dentist. Easier to keep these clean too - you just take it apart, wash each of the 2 pieces under water, dry with a towel and that&#x27;s it.  I&#x27;ve only had these a few days so I cant review battery life.  It comes with two brush heads - one is the little round one, the other is a larger one that&#x27;s supposed to remove more plaque but my husband said it feels a little too big.  Very happy with my purchase!</li>
            <li> I hope this toothbrush lasts as many years as the one it replaced, which was at least ten years old. I love how clean it leaves my mouth feeling: if I go away and have to use an ordinary toothbrush for even a few days I find myself delighting in the dental-cleaning-clean feeling I get when I come home to my trusty electric. I don&#x27;t know whether all electric toothbrushes are as good, but this one is great. Buy one!</li>
            <li> ive had this for about a year. I couldn&#x27;t remember to buy the brush head. soooooo good to brush my gums and teeth again. my teeth are is great shape thanks to this jewel...and im a smoker too. well packed and a quick post</li>
            <li> We have used this brand of tooth brush fdor years and they are great. The 1st we received was not working properly and Amazon sent another one with very fast delivery. After we recieved the replacement we snt the first back prepaid. Excellent service from Amazon.</li>
            <li> I bought this toothbrush because I didn&#x27;t feel like I needed all the bells and whistles that come with Oral B top of the line. I&#x27;d worn out 2 Braun Professional Care(#? the good 2-speed one) before this so it had been years since I looked for a new toothbrush. I didn&#x27;t want reminders and lcd screens... this thing goes in my mouth for pete&#x27;s sake!! I miss the high speed. The charging stand absolutely sucks for my needs. I think about sending it back... but it&#x27;s been in my mouth!! caveat emptor</li>
            <li> This toothbrush works well. There is no need to buy the more expensive one. I love the prices and the free shipping. I am also getting a rebate from Oral B. I have been using Oral B electric toothbrushes for years. They are definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> We have had several electric tooth brushes since the 1960&#x27;s. The last two were Oral-B. They each lasted several years. This model is the most powerful and cleans in more than one direction. It has a built in timer that alerts you every 30 seconds as the minimum for cleaning each area of the mouth. It does not have storage for the brushes. We kept the brush storage from the last one.</li>
            <li> Works great!  I bought it to replace our last Oral B electric toothbrush that lasted several years.  I like the size of this one and that you can take it off the charger and it lasts a LONG time before it needs recharging.</li>
            <li> this is a very good product. the same brush is being sold for 70 or more at retail i really like this because it has a lot more rpm as compared to my older electric tooth brush which i retired after 8 years in service</li>
            <li> I have no complaints about this product.  Gentle enough to brush without  hurting my gums, but powerful enough to leave my teeth feeling incredibly clean.  The brush heads wear out a bit quickly, but I also tend to be a long brusher, so I wouldn&#x27;t attribute it to the product.</li>
            <li> I did a bit of research before ordering the Precision 1000.  I am pleased with the toothbrush. The only negative is it takes a while to charge.</li>
            <li> Not as strong brushing as I expected. The charge only last for 2 brushing.</li>
            <li> My dental hygienist recommended that I give the Oral-B a try. I love it; it really seems to do a great job. I can&#x27;t wait to hear what my hygienist says at my next visit.......</li>
            <li> Sound is ringing, easy bleeding, brushing your teeth is worse than the philips a lot</li>
            <li> Simple, easy to charge, easy to wash and to replace the brushes, the battery lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> We like this product. We have an older model for 4 toothbrush heads. We needed this for our son in the second bathroom. It works well.</li>
            <li> My healthy  white smile is worth the price, plus the fact that it&#x27;s rechargeable. I would recommend this product to everyone.</li>
            <li> My 5 year old model finally gave up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Appreciate that I can just toss the toothbrush in my bag for a 5 day trip and have plenty of power without the charger.  As the battery ages (years) the charge will lessen .  My sense is that this is an improved product on what was always a very good product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended</li>
            <li> I have had a similar toothbrush in the past, but the model has been discontinued. the new brush is not as good as the previous one, but is not that bad.  It osculates much slower, but it still gets the job done.  I don&#x27;t understand why manufacturers discontinue an item that works so well for a model that is not as good.</li>
            <li> Works great and cleanin is easier now and I recommend this to all</li>
            <li> I replaced my older Oral B model with this one and what a difference!  I have always loved the Oral-B brand and once again, they did not let me down.</li>
            <li> so suitable~~~~~~~~~~~~i love it~~~~~~~</li>
            <li> Excellent basic electric toothbrush without all the unnecessary and expensive add-ons.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had the Oral-B PRO 1000 for a week, but so far I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase.  It&#x27;s reasonably priced and does a really good job of getting my teeth &amp;#34;squeaky clean&amp;#34;.  I have a lot of crowns, implants, etc. and this brush gets into all the nooks and crannies and helps me to get that fresh feeling you have after visiting the dentist for a cleaning.</li>
            <li> i expected it&#x27;s a product that with 8,800 oscillations and 40,000 pulsations per minutes. But i got feedback from consumer care that &#x27;the information on our website (8,800 oscillations and 40,000 pulsations) is actually the global toothbrush information. These toothbrushes would be distributed in countries like Europe. The Oral-B Professional Care 1000 toothbrushes that are sold in North America will have the 8,800 oscillations per minute but only 20,000 pulsations per minute&#x27;.</li>
            <li> Works great.  No problems.</li>
            <li> K.i.s.s. method in all it&#x27;s glory. Keep it simple stupid. Enough said. Need i say more? I didn&#x27;t think shi</li>
            <li> My husband ordered this model and he is very satisfied.  Easy to use and has the 2 minute timer.</li>
            <li> Works great....a bargain at the price compared to the other models. Very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I used sonic one before and its hard to get used to.  we will see in few month. May be I will go back to sonic</li>
            <li> Good value.  Very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Bought this item in September 2014 and quit working in August of 2015.</li>
            <li> Love it! Worth every penny! :-)</li>
            <li> Works great. The only reason for not giving it 5 starts is when the device is charging the flashing LED is rather bright and reminds me of a large, bright outdoor sign flashing on and off. But, with a little ingenuity the LED can be covered with material to reduce the brightness level.</li>
            <li> Decided to go back to Braun and it is a great device and feels good to get a really good clean again.</li>
            <li> This is a great toothbrush.  You have to clean the base holder everyday otherwise it gets moldy.  That&#x27;s why I didn&#x27;t give it five stars, but otherwise I love it!</li>
            <li> I thought I would give an electric toothbrush a try and after reading the reviews I picked this one and have not been disappointed. It does a great job on my teeth without beating up my gums which I tended to do with a regular toothbrush.</li>
            <li> i had for 5 years still going. reliable and cleans better than hand brush</li>
            <li> Grabbed it when it was on sale here on Amazon, it was almost half of what I would have to pay at the store...the only down side is that this doesn&#x27;t seem to have the &amp;#34;sensitive&amp;#34; mode, it says it does, but maybe mine is &#x27;defective&#x27; - but whatever, so not worth the bother to send it back, everything else is great - used it to replace a 3 year old Oral-B Pro...</li>
            <li> What a great product.  Love the power, feel and clean this toothbrush provides.  My last Braun was 10 years old and I replaced it with this one.  You could say I am a big fan of Braun.</li>
            <li> Have always used an Oral-B electric brush since they came on the market.  Makes my teeth feel cleaner and fresher.  I bought this to replace my older and sluggish tooth brush.  I luv it!  I don&#x27;t think they make a better one!</li>
            <li> This is the second one I purchased. It does a very nice job cleaning your teeth. It has a vibration in the handle so you know how long you have been brushing. I bought this one to replace the first one that my son broke. He is very tough on things.  This one was about half the price of the first one I bought last year.</li>
            <li> Have had an Oral B for a number of years but it was the economy model.  This is the turbo version.  Every time I brush my teeth feel like they were just cleaned by the dentist.  I also feel it will reduce the amount of plaque left between dentist visits.&lt;br /&gt;Great charge time of up to 5 days.</li>
            <li> This is the second one I purchased.  The first one got left behind somewhere.  The two minute timer works well.  My dental hygienist is happy with the condition of my teeth.  I don&#x27;t need more bells and whistles.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush does a great job. It works well.  Unfortunately I found it for $30 at Walmart later.  Had swift service from Amazon.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> We have used Oral-B rechargeable toothbrushes for several years and are quite satisfied with them. This latest one seems to operate at a higher speed, which we like, and it has a nice balance when handling. I would highly recommend this unit.</li>
            <li> I bought this brush for just $9.99 with $20 MIR by Oral B. Delivered on time and everything looks good to me except the brush head. Sounds like it&#x27;s time to change the brush head and it&#x27;s just 2-3 weeks back only I bought this brush. Not happy since brush head is the main part of the brush.</li>
            <li> Our 1000 model lasted us just over 10 months before the battery cell went bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I call Oral-B.  They assure me that the NiMh cells they use will last a minimum of three years and realistically a max of 5 years.  Sounds great.  If that happens, then I&#x27;ll have gotten my money&#x27;s worth from it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No problem.  I&#x27;ve used these toothbrushes for 12 years now.  They&#x27;re workhorses.  We just got a bad one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Send it in to a service center for warranty claim.  Postage + insurance costs $8.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Three weeks later, we get back a used charger and what appears to be a new 3000-series brush unit.  Fine with us.  Only two problems...It takes right at two days undisturbed on the charger to reach a full charge AND from full charge we get 2-3 brushings before the motor runs too slow to be useful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another bad battery cell?  I don&#x27;t know.  Maybe it&#x27;s the used charger, but I doubt it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another $8 to send this piece of crap back to the service center.  Another three weeks to get it back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good.  A different used charger and a brush handle that also appears to be other than new.  The female charge socket of the brush handle was quite scuffed and dirty, suggesting it had been on an off of a charging unit quite a bit, like maybe at someone else&#x27;s house.  I look at it and think, \\&quot;Oh, good...I just paid $16 in postage for a used toothbrush.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We put this one on the charger.  2-1/2 days later (I&#x27;m not exaggerating) the handle shows a full charge.  It&#x27;s two weeks later now and it still takes 2-1/2 days on the charger to get a full charge.  Obviously a bad cell, charger, or charging circuit, or a little of all three.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do I spend another $8 to repeat this process yet again (for the third time in six weeks)?  Nope.  $24 and 9 weeks of hassle just isn&#x27;t a fair price for a used toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was a long-time happy customer of this line of brushes.  At present, I&#x27;m on the lower edge of just a customer of this line of brushes.  And I&#x27;ll jump ship as soon as I find something that I think might actually last.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my opinion, based on my experience, you should be pleasantly surprised if any of these electric brushes (of at least the 1000 and 3000 models) lasts more than a year.  Going in with your expectations set low will most likely save you some of the frustration we&#x27;ve had with our several these past couple months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush still does a great job cleaning our teeth, but I&#x27;ve stopped looking at Oral-B as a tank and more as a disposable unit that will have to be replaced within a year.In my opinion, based on my experience, you should be pleasantly surprised if any of these electric brushes (of at least the 1000 and 3000 models) lasts more than a year.

            <li> I recieved this toothbrush for Christmas and I was very excited to get it. When I first used it I felt it was a bit harsh on my teeth, but I usually use a manual, non-electric toothbrush so I thought I just wasn&#x27;t used to it. The harshness also made my gums bleed. Taking care of my teeth and gums is a big thing for me(I brush at least 2 times a day, floss everyday, and use mouth wash), so I don&#x27;t think it was from lack of care. I continued using it, because I thought I would just get used to it. After a few days, however, I noticed a layer of my front teeth was scraped off. I&#x27;m not sure how to explain it, but I discontinued using it for fear it was hurting my teeth. My teeth may just be sensitive compared to others, but it&#x27;s not a good toothbrush for me. I did like the 2 minute timer, separated into 30 second segments though.</li>
            <li> If you want a power toothbrush this is the one. We have tried the cheap ones found in most department stores and besides them being huge and bulky they never seem to work for more than a couple months. We tried these and what a huge difference. So slim and comfortable to hold, this brush shape can really get into all the corners and clean the days plaque away. Really helps gum health as well. After using this religiously gums are so clean and healthy, rarely any sensitivity or redness anymore. Holds a charge for a few days if you forget to put it back on its dock. If you don&#x27;t like the small brush heads other sizes are compatible with this. Recommend these to everyone of all ages. You should not be brushing with a manual toothbrush anymore - this takes so much less time and you really feel the difference. Like getting a cleaning at the dentist clean.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been used to a normal toothbrush all these days....so it felt a bit weird when i started using an electronic one...but using it seems more efficient....</li>
            <li> Bought this as an additional one for a child.  These are great toothbrushes.  No complaints.  Recommend to others and woud buy again.</li>
            <li> I bought it as a replacement for my Oral-B Triumph which I had for maybe 10 years.  The Triumph had several speeds for different brushes but the only brush I used was the Floss Action.  So I bought the PRO 1000 which has only one speed.  It is much lighter and the stand does not take up much space on the counter.  It is also quieter than the Trumph.</li>
            <li> I have used Oral-B electrics for years love them. This one comes with the side to side head which the picture does not show. So off to buy different head! I would give 5 stars for the brush it self.</li>
            <li> Last Oral-B toothbrush I had lasted almost 20 years.  This one promises to be just as useful.  I like the 30-sec stutter-stop.  Reminds me to do my teeth in quadrants.  The recharge light is a little obtrusive in that it blinks instead of just a stead glow.  Can be annoying for the middle of the night bathroom visits but since you only have to charge it every two weeks or so I can deal with it.</li>
            <li> Toothbrush is ok.  We could have done better on the price elsewhere.  Our fault.</li>
            <li> Hate the toothbrush head...I don&#x27;t feel it accomplishes any more than the basic brush heads.</li>
            <li> Had to buy a new one because my last one died after 6 years of continued use.  Love using these.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product. It works great. Oral-B is a name you can trust and this product is proof.</li>
            <li> This is the worst electric brush I&#x27;ve ever had.  I was a long-time Oral-B fan.  This one, though, leaves pieces of food between my teeth and along my gum line, even when brushing for the full 2 minutes, in 30 second quadrants.  I do NOT recommend it.</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush! Very happy that I purchased this!</li>
            <li> Purchased this for my husband, and he loves it!  Great product!</li>
            <li> There are slight modifications, but basically this is the same Oral-B&lt;br /&gt;toothbrush that has been popular for years.  The recharging base is&lt;br /&gt;now quite small, which is convenient if you are short of space.</li>
            <li> this version has a larger head and thus seems more effective than the previous model I had&lt;br /&gt;love it</li>
            <li> Having never used an &amp;#34;electric&amp;#34; toothbrush before, it did feel weird at first but I am getting used to it. Teeth feel very clean and I have more confidence that I am reaching all the areas in my mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only thing I don&#x27;t love is that it pulses what seems every 30 seconds. I&#x27;m assuming that this is for monitoring cleaning time but I wish it would softly beep instead of interrupting my brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product. Oh and it&#x27;s much quieter than my wife&#x27;s Sonicare (sounds like a plane taking off).</li>
            <li> this is my first electric toothbrush and i have to say that i love the way it makes my teeth and mouth feel. I have never felt such a clean other than getting my 6 month check up at my dentist. I totally love this product and recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> I have some problems with my teeth and my dentist ask me to use a smaller tooth brush to reach to all the difficult areas, special behind the lower jaw teeth.&lt;br /&gt;The results are amazing and I cant be happier!</li>
            <li> Love it. Great toothbrush and cheaper than wal-****!</li>
            <li> This was a Christmas gift for my son and the brand he specifically asked for.  I will probably order it again for myself.</li>
            <li> I bought this toothbrush to replace an older version of it. This one has a &amp;#34;timer&amp;#34; that goes off every 30 seconds so you know you&#x27;ve brushed each quadrant of your teeth for the right amount of time.</li>
            <li> Have never used an electric toothbrush before. Very pleased with the results. I feel like I&#x27;ve just come from the dentist every time I use it.</li>
            <li> Great price nice small stand. Keeps a charge for at least 5 days. Definitely recommend</li>
            <li> Dentist tells me that my oral hygiene is perfect, and all I have used for years is this type of Oral B electric toothbrush.  So I would highly recomend it.  The downside is that Oral B rips you off with the price of replacement brushes.</li>
            <li> I love my new Oral-b Pro Healthy Clean Precision 1000 rechargeable electric toothbrush.  It does need to be recharged after a few days of use (the red light flashes on the device), however, I do brush for a lengthy time each time I use it.  I&#x27;m so glad I bought it!</li>
            <li> the funtion is simple and easy to use. but the charger is for US (110-130v) and couldn&#x27;t use it in China.</li>
            <li> Good price, but they seem very firm.</li>
            <li> We owned an older model for many years and were fairly happy with it. We only replaced it because it was starting to not keep a charge very long. When we started using this model, we were blown away by how much more powerful it seems to be. Our teeth feel noticeably cleaner and we are able to use a much lighter touch than before while getting better results. The charge indicator lights are nice, as is the quadrant notification feature. I notice that 2 minutes seems to go by much faster now and I am actually brushing for the entire 2 minutes where I used to hardly ever do that. Great product.</li>
            <li> I have never had an electric toothbrush before and I am amazed with how well it cleans.  It is very quiet and I like the feature that slows down or stops the toothbrush if you are brushing too hard.. I bought  two and gave the other to my partner.  His old electric toothbrush wasn&#x27;t doing the job and it was very noisy.</li>
            <li> I would personally go with next model up that has 2 speeds.  I ended up giving this one away, because it was a little slow for my liking.</li>
            <li> my wife bought this for a xmas gift for her son she has one and loves it, and decided to buy one for him</li>
            <li> Does an excellent job of cleaning.  Brush and product design is simple.  Easy to use.  Definitely gets the job done.  I ordered it online for value as comparable brushes were selling for higher prices in local retail.</li>
            <li> Had one before and loved it. Better than the Philips. Had better teeth cleaning experience. Arrived very quickly. Happy with my purchase</li>
            <li> This toothbrush works well enough - it&#x27;s not as fast as the better Oral-B models, but it does a decent job. It gives a brief &#x27;pulse&#x27; every 30 seconds to remind you to switch quadrants - personally I find this annoying but not terribly so. Otherwise, it does exactly what it should.</li>
            <li> Replaced another Oral B that was still working after 5 or so years.  The new one makes a huge difference</li>
            <li> Works as you would expect, initial battery lasted only a year. Proceed if replacing battery is your last resort.  If the product is out of warranty, the battery is replaceable. If you&#x27;re savvy enough, use the battery disposal instructions and take everything apart gently (primarily \\&quot;breaking\\&quot; the cap off the bottom and don&#x27;t use a screwdriver to pry the circuit board away from the battery). Original battery for me was a 1.2V 1100mAh Ni-MH AA battery w/ solder tabs (plenty of room for a capacity upgrade). There are 4 solder joints. Have fun.</li>
            <li> I like this brand oral-B. the price is good.</li>
            <li> a very powerful electrical toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;pro:&lt;br /&gt;- Cheap, portable, powerful and easy to handle&lt;br /&gt;con:&lt;br /&gt;- little bit loud, no setting to adjust the rotation speed.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace my many years old one of the same model.  And so far this one is exactly as I expected. I control the length of time I brush each area of my teeth, and I like that I can easily change the type of various brush heads depending upon what function I want to perform.&lt;br /&gt;More Whitening, more cleaning, sensitivity, etc.  This is far superior to the lower end electronic toothbrushes and the easy to use plug in charging station keeps this running 7 days or longer on one charge, and there are NO batteries to mess with.  If you need heavier duty cleaning, this isn&#x27;t for you. This is the 20,000 pulses model.  And the price on Amazon was the best I found.</li>
            <li> Good toothbrush. Twice a day for 2 minutes or more. Highly reviewed and for a reason, replace you normal tooth brush now and make the switch, you wont regret it.</li>
            <li> My new favorite tooth brush! Exceeded my expectations</li>
            <li> I bought this toothbrush after doing a little bit of research into Oral-B and Sonicare. The different I found between the two was that this not only vibrated, but the bristles rotate. The Sonicare brush only vibrates.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works great, my mouth definitely feels cleaner than with a manual toothbrush. What is nice is that the brush automatically vibrates extra every thirty (30) seconds, to let you know you should move to a knew place in your mouth. The instructions break up your mouth into four (4) quadrants with thirty (30) seconds a piece so you know you are spending adequate time in each area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve owned it for a few weeks now and I have not had to charge it yet, and this is using it twice a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this brush to anyone thinking of buying an electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t need lots of whistles and bells, just a tooth brush to clean my teeth.  This does the job...well, simply and fast.</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;pulsating&amp;#34; mentioned oh-so-briefly in the product description is actually a very unpleasant and extremely strong jackhammer effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Had to return -- I could not use for more than a few seconds without developing a headache and nausea, much like motion sickness. I could feel the pounding of the brush throughout my skull.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not cool. I notice that a lot of the negative comments mention it, so apparently it&#x27;s either more pronounced in some units than others, or many folks just aren&#x27;t as bothered by it. Hard for me to believe, though -- it is RELENTLESS.</li>
            <li> I was looking for something better since my 12yr old oral b spinbrush was getting seasoned. Night &amp; day feeling in my mouth. My teeth are far from perfect &amp; bleed easy while brushing. Didn&#x27;t have that problem &amp; made me wanna brush more! It vibrates like crazy, takes some getting used to, no beeping every 30 seconds just on/off. Overall recommended for the cost.</li>
            <li> Use it every day.  Great item.</li>
            <li> Excellent quality all parts made in Germany including the brush head.</li>
            <li> This is a great replacement for a old similar brush that was finally worn out. Got it at a reduced price and could not be happier.</li>
            <li> really like this oral b.  Had sonicare and like this much much better.</li>
            <li> Toothbrush was great until the day the base just stopped charging it. Now, it might as well be a paperweight. Even though this happened within the first year, the supposed warranty is so absurd -- you have to keep the original receipt, not just the original proof of purchase -- that it is impossible to take advantage of it. Never buying this inferior brand again. And to think Braun used to be a symbol of quality.</li>
            <li> Love it! This was a replacement and it works even better than the one I had.</li>
            <li> This brush does the job very well, and way cheaper than most. I&#x27;m very happy with it and would recommend it. You really don&#x27;t need more bells and whistles (including a bigger stand that takes up more space on your counter) than this unit, which uses the same brushes I had on hand from my last Oral-B brush.</li>
            <li> Very noisy but gets the job done.  Better to keep it on the stand than have it die on you after not charging for a few days.</li>
            <li> The product works well, but I was disappointed that a base to hold at least 2 brushes was not included.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is incredibly convenient. It doesn&#x27;t make an annoying sound when you&#x27;re using it, the charging process is seamless and simple, and it&#x27;s not heavy. I&#x27;m so happy I bought this brush!</li>
            <li> i purchased this product to replace an oral-b vitality sonic toothbrush. the rotational/vibrational action from this model i thought would provide superior cleaning. it absolutely does. as far as cleaning, it&#x27;s a 5 star product. while it is possible to spend much more on an electronic toothbrush, i really doubt you are getting cleaner teeth for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i have been using this product for 2 months now. i have to say it is kind of an ordeal to use this thing. it is loud. while brushing, it sounds like a cessna in flight. if you open your mouth just right, it will sound like someone is playing a didgeridoo in your bathroom. you should also know that, because it rotates, it can fling small toothpaste globs, so i don&#x27;t recommend brushing with this just before you head out for work in the suit and tie. nothing stains quite like toothpaste. the brush head also seems like it is deeper to accommodate the moving parts. it&#x27;s not as comfortable as other brushes i have used. it reaches everywhere, though. lastly, the timer goes off every 15-30 seconds to prompt you to change quadrants in your mouth. useful, but also kinda nagging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;brushing your teeth used to be so simple. now it&#x27;s an ordeal. but for the effectiveness of the cleaning, i guess it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> Not sure if there is just a flaw in the one I received as it skips on and off as I use it?????</li>
            <li> Great price, nice design, decent battery life and very nice brush.&lt;br /&gt;This is a perfect option for an everyday brush to keep in your bag or for a travel brush.&lt;br /&gt;Also, the amazon locker system is absolutely fantastic!</li>
            <li> The Oral B electric toothbrush is fantastic!! My teeth are very close together and I really didn&#x27;t like flossing because it was painful. This toothbrush, if used twice a week, allows a person to do little or no flossing. It helps eliminate plaque and tartar. It also cleans your teeth excellently.</li>
            <li> It does an excellent job of cleaning the teeth. It is a different method than my Sonicare &amp; I much prefer it. The fine design leaves few open areas, so no slime can collect as it did in my Sonicare , and it is very easy to keep the electric handle &amp; brush clean after each use..</li>
            <li> I have owned several of these over time model has changed and gotten better, you certainly dont need anything mero complex than this.</li>
            <li> So far, I am very happy with my purchase. This brush has the right amount of pressure to keep my teeth and gums nice and healthy. I use it for a few weeks without needing to recharge it. When you charge this unit, it does take a long time to charge, but it doesn&#x27;t bother me. When it needs charging, I will simply use it , and put it back on the charger.  Then I will put away the charger until it needs more juice. Great buy!</li>
            <li> What a great toothbrush!  The vibration does a terrific job of cleaning.  The size is just right and it fits quite easily on the charger.</li>
            <li> Purchased this brush to replace our old electric toothbrush, that after 4 years finally went up. I am very pleased with the smaller base size which frees up more cabinet space. Love the battery indicator lights and the 30 second notifications to switch sides. Good product so far!</li>
            <li> Best ever, had one for ten years and when it wore out had to purchase another one.  Tried another but took it back.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush works fine but I wonder if I got one that was sitting around in the warehouse too long. The instructions say that you can leave the toothbrush off the charger for up to a week, but I&#x27;ve noticed the motor runs more slowly if I leave it off the charger for even a day.</li>
            <li> I bought this from a regular store, not from here... But I I&#x27;m very happy with it,  if you charge it for the whole night ( I will say 9, 10 hrs)  the charging time will last for more than a week, almost two weeks.  I&#x27;m thinking on buying another one for my daughter,  I recommend it.</li>
            <li> Outstanding device to brush teeth.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t waste money on the sonic style or other gimmicks. This basic model is great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;ll reach all the way back to clean and that&#x27;s important. You&#x27;ll do a lot of cleaning in 2-3 minutes and that&#x27;s important. Use the Dual Action, full sized heads for maximum effect, that&#x27;s easier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Heads are pricey, so buy them in the six pack, that will last a about a year. Find a deal and those are about $30.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The last one of these lasted me 11 years and I&#x27;m going on 4 years with my current model like this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pay now or pay later, with a trip to the dentist. You will be okay with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Worth for the money you paid.</li>
            <li> I have this on auto ship, so I have probably already given a review at some point, but I shall do so again. This is a great product. These brushes along with the motor clean teeth so well, that my dentist is always amazed by how little plaque I have.</li>
            <li> No complaints. Working well, not too chubby. Not too noisy. Just OK. The $30 price is great, considering it can last for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not sure about the cost of brushes.</li>
            <li> It works as it should.  I keep it charging all the time per instructions.  It is a newer battery, they no longer use NicC it is NicM.  As long as it is totally discharge every 6 months it should be fine.  I like the quarterly pulses, it times the 4 areas of the teeth.  Not too sure about the brush head.  I am still trying to get used to it. If I find I do not like it, I can buy any of the other varieties they offer .... anther plus.&lt;br /&gt;The more expensive ones have more bells and whistles, but I still believe they do the SAME job of cleaning the teeth.</li>
            <li> Good price with promotion code.</li>
            <li> I only have had the electric toothbrushes that you buy from your regular pharmacy type store but this is on a much higher caliber! Its like a machine polisher that they use but on your teeth! It really does a very good job at cleaning and having it feel clean. Visually like a buffer as well. I would say this is my favorite toothbrush ever. I always thought it was stupid to buy a tooth brush over $5 that you manually use but wow I was completely wrong! This is a need!</li>
            <li> Everything&#x27;s perfect about this brush. Never had anything make my teeth feel so clean on the surface and in the spaces between.</li>
            <li> This is my third Oral-B electrical toothbrush. Initially I owned a battery operated one. After it go rusty in the battery compartment because the moisture was seeping in, I&#x27;ve purchased a step up, a rechargeable version, but it was not a Pro flavor. Despite having a Ni-Cd battery, it has been working for probably 4 years and is still operational. After using the 1000 model for couple weeks, I plan to take the previous one to my office. After 1000, that one feels so mild, more for gums, rather than teeth. Now I am even surprised that I used to brush with that for 4 years!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one is marked as \\&quot;Made in Germany.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, with all the addition of bathroom gadgets that require electricity, the next problem is to install extra GFI outlets and hide all the cords!</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is fantastic.  I&#x27;ve had electric toothbrushes b/4, but this really, really cleans my teeth &amp; massages my gums.</li>
            <li> Great at this price point. Does what I need and expect. Teeth feel great (when I spend the 2 min and do it right)!&lt;br /&gt;*GOOD* &#x3D; Powerful, good reach.&lt;br /&gt;*BAD* &#x3D; A bit loud, tough to hang on to when wet, would prefer a &amp;#34;beep&amp;#34; instead of the pulse after 30 sec interval, takes a long time to charge fully. Only one head provided.</li>
            <li> Speed and pressure is fine. I like it. Judy</li>
            <li> I was disappointed. It only has one speed and that is super fast.</li>
            <li> It has lived up to my expectations and I enjoy using it.</li>
            <li> This is an item I would glad recommend to other of my friends and family&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Go Oral-B save our gums and teeth</li>
            <li> The Oral-B does a great job.  Wish i had not waited so long to purchase one.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend it to anyone that is interested in Dental hygiene.</li>
            <li> Amazing product!&lt;br /&gt;I love it, feel my mouth is super clean and fresh.&lt;br /&gt;Love the mechanism that lets you know when to change cleansing location.&lt;br /&gt;One con - only one brushing speed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had good luck with Oral-B Professional Healthy Clean Products.  Was a little disappointed that I found a better price at BJ&#x27;s Wholesale Club after I had purchased this, but service and other items I purchased made up the difference.  Will shop a little more thoroughly next time.</li>
            <li> This is my 4th Oral-B.  I&#x27;ve lost 2 - left them in Hotel rooms....&lt;br /&gt;They all do basically the same thing.  This one has a 30 second time that reduces the brush speed momentarily.  I am still not fully used to it after about a month, but getting there.  My brain thinks that it the battery is dying.&lt;br /&gt;My dental checkups are proof that this brush does a great job.</li>
            <li> I use it to brush my teeth, up and down, side to side, and it does a good job. Amen</li>
            <li> Seems to be quite good at brushing but not overbrushing.  My dentist told me I needed it.</li>
            <li> Works extremely well. Had to replace and older Oral-B electric toothbrush that finally died and this new model makes a noticeable improvement in how clean my teeth feel.</li>
            <li> This is the best toothbrush that costs less than 30 dollars. It cleans almost same as the ones that cost around $100. If you simply want an electric toothbrush and don&#x27;t want extra unnecessary features, then this is the one to get. It simply works and cleans like it should. It even has pressure sensative sensors that stops the brush when you brush too hard. It lacks the different modes and it is less powerful than the higher models. Honesly, from what i have read, most people don&#x27;t switch modes when brushing. All I need it to do is spin. You can purchase all the brush heads that are avaliable for different types of cleaning. I am very happy with it and would buy agian.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with the results .Works better than the old one I had.  My wife just loves hers too.Recommend it to every one.</li>
            <li> Loooooove this toothbrush! It vibrates every 30 seconds so you know how long to brush each quarter section of your teeth, very helpful.</li>
            <li> I got one of these for me a few years ago and just got another one for my wife.  They work well.  Mine has some rust leaking around the top but it still works.</li>
            <li> This is a great toothbrush for a small amount of money.  I like the fact that it breaks the 2 minutes down to 30 seconds per quadrant of your mouth.  This helps insure that you cover all areas.  It also seems to get my teeth cleaner than an older earlier version Oral-B that I needed to replace.  The only thing that you should be aware of is that although it comes with a charger, there is no place to hold the brush attachment.  I use a small capped container.  If you absolutely prefer brush storage with your electric brush - this isn&#x27;t for you.</li>
            <li> I’ve been wanting an electrical toothbrush and i am glad i bought this one! love it. works great</li>
            <li> i dont knoe hoe i didid without it beforei love this thing.it does a great job.use it and recharge when not using it. works out well</li>
            <li> Very good brush for the price. I feel like it cleans my teeth quite a bit better than a standard toothbrush. I&#x27;ve had it for a couple of months and it is still running strong.  The only bad thing about it is that it is annoyingly loud, not too big of deal, but just have to be thoughtful if your significant other is asleep nearby.</li>
            <li> I hate brushing my teeth, but this thing makes it fun.  It&#x27;s got a lot of power behind it, and the charging base, which is kid-safe, is really innovative.  It does require pretty regular cleaning of the whole unit, including the charging base, but it&#x27;s a small price to pay.  Really happy with my purchase and considering buying one for my wife as well.</li>
            <li> I had an oral b professional 3000 or 5000.  It died after about 4-5 years. I was very happy with it. I purchased this to replace it, being that it looked very similar and cost about 40 bucks.  I figured it was the same version as my previous one without any bells and whistles.  I figured wrong....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This isn&#x27;t a bad brush, but it has about half the power of the spendier units. To get the full oral b experience it looks like you&#x27;ll have to spend at least 80 dollars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The worst part is that the sonicare version in this price range is the full power sonicare brush without the bells and whistles. I strongly recommend that if you only want to spend about 40 dollars, get the sonicare essence 5600 or whatever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now if you can spend more, the difference between the sonicare and the oral b is a toss up, but at this price range you deffinitely should go with the sonicare.</li>
            <li> Love this tooth brush. We all have it here in our house, even my 4.5 yo. And she brushes while watching the oral B app. It has the times every 30 seconds so you can switch corners in your mouth. This model is fine for me, don&#x27;t need to spend more money for a fancier brush.</li>
            <li> Small brush head lets you get to hard to reach corners of your mouth, but the brush itself seems a little stiff.</li>
            <li> Love this toothbrush! great price and performance</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years. Fantastic product.</li>
            <li> All of the features a good except the auto-stop pressure sensor. It doesn&#x27;t work on ours, anyway. And that was one of the biggest draws to this product in particular. Otherwise, we really like how quickly it charges and that it does 30 second timers to make sure all four quadrants of the mouth, outlined in the included instruction manual, get a full 2 minutes.</li>
            <li> Best electric toothbrush I have ever had and I have had many.</li>
            <li> very durable and easy to use. makes cleaning my teeth easier and whitens too!</li>
            <li> My teeth are so clean it feels like I&#x27;ve just been to the dentist.  I did not take it on a recent vacation with me and regretted it, very very much.</li>
            <li> Not happy that what is pictured is not what I got....where is the base?</li>
            <li> Had a credit to use and chose this product. It is good quality and has proved to be of good value</li>
            <li> I use in conjunction with the floss-action heads. I find that it works great, my teeth feel clean and n earthy after every brush. Please comment if this review was helpful.</li>
            <li> This is not an easy product to find or price in department stores or drugstores; it was a fair price for it and worked well.</li>
            <li> Best for the price....</li>
            <li> Bought it to replace a similar model whose battery died after about 2 years. Oddly, I have an older Oral-B that is 4 years old, and is still working perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;We will see if this latest one stands up.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush has definitely improved my dental hygiene.  The timing feature works very well and my teeth are always left feeling very clean</li>
            <li> This is easy to pack to travel, it does not have all those accessories some of them have.&lt;br /&gt;It has a lot of power.</li>
            <li> Replaced an older model. Works great.</li>
            <li> My teeth feel so clean! I also love the 30 second timer: it helps me budget my time and brush my teeth evenly. The dentist was pleased!</li>
            <li> Very good , as advertised.</li>
            <li> Does the job!&lt;br /&gt;I have periodontal disease and must take care of cleaning my teeth and keeping the plaque off the teeth.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product from Amazon to be shipped in India. My biggest worry was if it will work in India with 220V 0Hz supply. Well it works like a charm, I have been using it for over 2 year years now. You just have to use a good 220V to 110V converter, try to use the heavy electric based converters as opposed to the light weight electronics based converters.</li>
            <li> I believe this is a an older model.  There is one that works just as well thats about ten dollars just has one less speed.  I would invest a little more to get the better model.</li>
            <li> Although quite expensive it will pay out over time saving dentist bills. You can save on spare brushes using the coupons or buying them on eBay.</li>
            <li> My old Oral-B finally died. It would turn itself on or could not be turned off. The 1000 makes my teeth feels much cleaner than my old toothbrush. As someone else said, the more expensive units are just bells and whistles. I am definitely recommending it.</li>
            <li> My wife said she just really liked this new toothbrush.  She said it fits well.  It has a fast speed, and seems to get her teeth really clean.  She was really glad to get this.  Glad it was on sale.  Mark</li>
            <li> Love this toothbrush!  Holds charge for a week and really effective.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful electric toothbrush which thoroughly cleans tooth! If you used this everyday I doubt you would ever get cavities! It is well worth the money! It takes down plaque beautifully! I highly recommend this toothbrush!</li>
            <li> Bought this for my girlfriend. She tried it as soon as it came . she&#x27;s loving it. It was a great gift.!</li>
            <li> This brush got great reviews. That&#x27;s why I bought it. It has turned out to be a good toothbrush. However, I cannot get past the gross gunk that develops on the base every single day!!!! I wipe down my toothbrush after every use. I cannot figure out what is causing the gunk to develop every day. It&#x27;s become such a bother. I hate it. It grosses me out. And, it does take some effort to get it clean...not just a quick swipe. Does anyone know what causes that gunk, and what to do to stop it?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The picture is after I cleaned it off last night, and used the toothbrush this morning. This is what it looks like when I go to use my toothbrush the next time. Ick!</li>
            <li> Did not last for long (battery recharging failed in less than 6 months), but it was a good toothbrush while it worked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: We discovered last night that it was not the toothbrush that failed, but the charger. Tried charging with an old base we had (one that conveniently fit), and it worked. So it seems that Braun should provide a way to purchase replacement bases. I have never seen any indication that they do, so my 2 rating still applies.</li>
            <li> Feels like I just left the dentist - teeth are so clean!  Like this better than my Sonic care Flex care, seems like it removes more stains.</li>
            <li> This is the 3rd one I have owned and theses things last at least 3 plus years.  I would definitely recommend them to anyone, They leave your teeth feeling nice and almost polished.  The value is a good, and they take up very little counter space even in the charger.  The only drawback I have heard of is the size of the brush head not being as large as some but it works great for me.</li>
            <li> I received a Dud. I charged it according to the instruction and it never worked it just makes a humming noise when you turn it on no oscilation or vibration was totally disappointed  however I must say that Amazon customer service was really helpful in the end</li>
            <li> Fantastic price and does a great job.  After the first brush with this new tooth brush, I could feel an immediate difference.  It feels like it is doing a much better job than a regular tooth brush.</li>
            <li> Bought these at the recommendation of our dentist. They work great and the charge lasts more than a week.</li>
            <li> I bought this Electric Toothbrush for my wife and so far she have not complaint so it is great so far.</li>
            <li> Recommended by our family dentist. Excellent price for 1000 rotations which is quite sufficient.  Best to order extra heads when buying toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I like this product very much.  I have been using Oral B electric brush ever since they came out with the product. It does the job well !</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s louder than my previous ultrasonic brush by Oral-B.  I was upset that they stopped making replacement brushes for my old one just three years into ownership.  This new version does the job, but it&#x27;s louder and the charging base can topple over with bad cable management.  Wrap up your cord well and it&#x27;ll be fine.  I hope they don&#x27;t stop making new brush heads for it over the next few years like they did my old one.  It wasn&#x27;t that old!  Anyway... I&#x27;m a fan of electric toothbrushes, and the battery life on this new Precision 1000 is a few days longer than my old variant, so that&#x27;s ok with me.</li>
            <li> This is a great step up from the entry level Oral B electric toothbrush that i have had for about 4 years. The original toothbrush was OK, but seemed to be loosing the capacity to recharge. This replacement and step-up is dramatically better, - it easily holds a charge for a week without recharging. The power is markedly better and the every 30 second reminder to move to the next quadrant of my teeth is nice to make sure that I am spending appropriate time on each area. The starter toothbrush has a 2 minute timer which kind of leaves you guessing as to how much time on each area. The cleaning action of this brush is much better.Had I known the difference between the starter level and this one, I would have spent the extra 10 or 15 bucks for this one. The starter level Oral B is actually OK, but the difference in the cleaning, longer charge, improved timer and better power makes this a better investment.</li>
            <li> This thing cleans much, much better than a manual toothbrush.  In fact, when we use manual toothbrushes for a couple days while traveling, my wife and I remark how we can&#x27;t wait to get home and properly clean our teeth.  You can really feel the difference.</li>
            <li> This was the first professional electric toothbrush I ever bought, so I wasn&#x27;t looking to spend a lot of money. I think this was well worth the cost. It has a 2-minute timer in intervals of 30 seconds. The charging station is very convienent. The toothbrush sits in the charging station while not in use, and then you can plug the station in when you want to charge the toothbrush. My girlfriend has this toothbrush as well and we&#x27;re both very happy with them.</li>
            <li> I love it because my wife&#x27;s breath smells great now after she uses it and it cleans her teeth wonderfully.</li>
            <li> Replaced one I had for many, many years so I was apprehensive.  It has been great.  Would buy it again.</li>
            <li> Just what I wanted at a reasonable cost.</li>
            <li> Oral B makes the best tooth brushes.  This is a replacement for a similar model that lasted nearly 10 years and finally just stopped charging. Wouldn&#x27;t buy anything but Oral B.</li>
            <li> Great deal. We bought two! Keeps charge for a long time, longer than expected. Dentist recommended. Good buy, no regrets.</li>
            <li> Oral B - spoiled me, can&#x27;t use a manual tooth brush &amp; it&#x27;s always ncie to get good dentist feedback</li>
            <li> Its powerful, gets your teeth really  clean</li>
            <li> Works even better than expected.  I&#x27;ve used the Oral B products for years now, but this is an upgrade for me and so far I love it.</li>
            <li> For the price, this is an excellent toothbrush.  I can use it for about a week without charging it, which is great for taking it on vacation since you don&#x27;t have to bring the charger.</li>
            <li> gets good reviews, but the vibrations are way too strong for me.  made me feel lightheaded.  doesn&#x27;t seem worth the money with such a limitation.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the spinbrush as compared to a back-and-forth type electric toothbrush. Even my husband says he feels his teeth get cleaner. The hygienist said 2 minutes with this equals 6 minutes of brushing with a manual toothbrush. There are rebates offered quite often, which makes it an even better deal.</li>
            <li> I love my new electric toothbrush. My teeth feel clean like if I came out of a dentist office. I like that handle is nice and sleek.</li>
            <li> Ok ive been an amazon prime customer for 1 month and its amazing. Toothbrush came in fast. Looks good and feels strong. I also bought extra tips for it here on amazon.&lt;br /&gt;FIRST, it takes about a full day for it to charge. Dont worry about over charging it shuts by itself.&lt;br /&gt;I actually just tried it out right now and it makes brushing alot less boring. Its pretty fun actually. I can just let it sit on each tooth for 6 seconds and damn do they feel all buffed and polished.&lt;br /&gt;Highly suggest you buy this one!</li>
            <li> When I other Oral-B died after many years use I couldn&#x27;t wait to have another.  Cleans teeth so much better than a toothbrush. Like the 30 second beeps and 2 minute beep.</li>
            <li> Toothbrushes purchased at the local grocer are never able to give me the clean mouth feel that an Oral-B electric brush does.  It&#x27;s small head allows me to reach the teeth farthest back in my mouth and I am always left with a smooth, clean finish.</li>
            <li> This is my first electric toothbrush - I&#x27;ve been using this for a few days now and I love it. My mouth feels exceptionally clean after using it, and I like that it pulsates every 30 seconds and a special pattern at 2 minutes to let you know when you&#x27;ve brushed long enough. I was looking at this and some sonic brushes that were double the price, and I&#x27;m definitely glad I went with this brush.</li>
            <li> Excellent purchase.  I&#x27;m very happy with it.</li>
            <li> This electric  tooth brush is of good quality compare what you can buy in another stores. Thanks</li>
            <li> Bought two and like them.</li>
            <li> Great, reasonable price makes me like it</li>
            <li> Best price for this item. And I looked everywhere.  Similar to ones I&#x27;ve had before but the base is smaller.  It&#x27;s just as powerful though!</li>
            <li> This is a great brush when it is working. Every now and then, it stops for a second then starts again. It is not from brushing too hard. It happens even if the brush is running out of my mouth. I must have received a faulty unit. While it is working, it cleans really well and I am overall happy with it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product to replace my original Oral-B rechargeable that finally wore out after 16 years. I bought another Oral-B because I was so satisfied with my prior unit.  I like the smaller charger base and new timer on this new one which is different than my old one.  Hoping to be using this one for just as long.  Oral-B toothbrushes are great!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it for about 3 months. It seems like the battery will not charge overnight, in that the toothbrush acts as if it&#x27;s about to die every morning. The charging light flashes, so it&#x27;s all hooked up. I&#x27;ve gone past the return date with Amazon, and I will get a new toothbrush. I cannot recommend this model at all. I have used Oral-B quite happily before, so it&#x27;s not the brand, just this model. Steer clear.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush cleans my teeth better than my last oral.B toothbrush. It did have to charge overnight initially to reach a full charge.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this toothbrush.  I bought it for my 10 year old son who has problems with brushing long enough; so this was perfect since it has a timer that allows it to brush for 2 minutes!  And if he brushes too hard, it quits spinning.  Perfect solution to my problem!!</li>
            <li> just love it for its convenience+ cleanliness. now I don&#x27;t miss any night&lt;br /&gt;What I miss here is hygiene cap if I want to carry while travelling.</li>
            <li> Received this a few days ago as an early Christmas gift and I use this as a toothbrush and polisher for my teeth. This toothbrush is very soft and gentle on my gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;+ What I like about it most is the fact that it fits my molars and all my teeth perfectly, and it cleans and polishes each tooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;+ The head is smaller than my Spinbrush, this is important to me because I have a small mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;+ Gentler than any battery, electric or rechargeable toothbrushes than I have used before. This is a must for me as I have tender gums--with this toothbrush, my gums DO NOT BLEED!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;+ My teeth are beginning to look whiter and brighter and shinier!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend this!</li>
            <li> Was looking for a new electric toothbrush to replace my 5 year Braun unit.  Very happy with the Oral B 1000 unit.</li>
            <li> I submitted the rebate several weeks ago, however no reply from the rebate center. They just cheat me and waste my time and money.</li>
            <li> After using manual and expensive brushes for many years, I found this item to be the best in Dental Hygiene.</li>
            <li> Holds a charge, cleans well, and I haven&#x27;t had any issues with it since I bought it - and that was months and months ago. Good product, good price.</li>
            <li> Works as advertised, I have been using it for past 3 weeks works great, I like it and would recommend it.</li>
            <li> The build quality is great on both the toothbrush and the charging base.  I love how small the base is and it doesn&#x27;t tip as easily as you&#x27;d think.  The toothbrush is a quality Oral-B product as to say it&#x27;s feels top notch and should last years.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I needed. I had one and needed a second handle and charger. All the heads fit well and my teeth feel so much better than with a manual brush.</li>
            <li> This brush is better than my previous SonicCare electric toothbrush. Sonicare is more expensive and I had to buy 2 in the past year and a half to replace broken ones. This is a basic brush and does a good job. There are a variety of brush heads to suit your needs. I had to get used to the larger brush heads but do not notice anymore. I am pleased with my purchase so far.</li>
            <li> I actually have not used.  Bought as gifts for grandsons.  They said it works great.  I need to follow up with them.</li>
            <li> she recently lost her other charger to her other brush so she just bought a new one and she is very happy with the one i had ordered her</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush I&#x27;ve been using it for about two years now and it&#x27;s working great! I got it on sale for 39.99 and have never looked back.</li>
            <li> It works great.  I had another just like it and used it for over three years before it battery went out.  I hope this one does as good</li>
            <li> I have always had a Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush and when my old one needed replacing I started searching for a new one. I was happy to find Amazon had what I was looking for.  Works great and I have had it for over a year now. No problems whatsoever. Would highly recommend this item.</li>
            <li> Unit seems well built, feels solid and of good quality materials. I am giving it only 3 stars because the one I received is missing the brush storage base - which is the reason I bought it in the first place. My kids will use it and I need for them to be able to store two brush heads. The picture on Amazon&#x27;s web site shows the unit with a storage base, but I only got the round charging base.</li>
            <li> pretty good but I had the original Oral B version for years that I paid $100 for which seemed like a lot at the time but it lasted for 12 years (changing heads of course) and was a work horse. This is like a lighter version of that, my teeth feel cleaner than they do with a normal brush but.... I suppose I will use it for a while but will eventually shell out a little more and get the next version up. a great toothbrush and clean teeth are a worthwhile investment, I suggest you spend a little more now and save later but if you can&#x27;t this is still pretty good.</li>
            <li> I have been an Oral B cusomer for over 20 years. My dental appointments for all of this time have shown that continuing use of this product, produces outstanding results. I have been using the Oral B Vitality toothbrushes for almost 5 years, and finally the batteries were wearing down.&lt;br /&gt;I upgraded to the Oral B 1000 and couldn&#x27;t be happier. I was stunned in the progress of battery design, and the Series 1000 was outstanding.&lt;br /&gt;I was blown away on first use as the power was twice that of the Vitality series. So in my opinion Oral B continue the tradition of producing&lt;br /&gt;an excellent product. I would purchase again.</li>
            <li> Lots of good reviews on this model, so I chose it, plus there was a $20 Oral-B rebate.  So far, done a good job, battery life is a week or more.</li>
            <li> My son has been using this for over 6 months and it has worked flawlessly. Since this has a lot of reviews and is no longer available, I won&#x27;t go on. Too bad it is no longer available, as I want to buy another.</li>
            <li> Item as described.  GReat seller!</li>
            <li> Love this toothbrush, it&#x27;s like getting a vibrating gum massage every time you brush. I had to see a periodontist for an issue, and she noticed the difference before and after this toothbrush right away. I also noticed a huge difference when I floss afterwards (without getting too gross).</li>
            <li> Excellent unit. It does exactly what I intened it to do!</li>
            <li> My old battery operated toothbrush finally quit on me. This new rechargeable toothbrush is amazing! I love it!</li>
            <li> Seems to work well so far.  Different than my last Oral B brush which lasted about 10 years.  Delivery was quick.</li>
            <li> Battery does not hold enough charge for more than one use before having to recharge.</li>
            <li> Super pleased with this purchased and my teeth love it more</li>
            <li> Brushes really well, I noticed my teeth cleaner and whiter compared to manual brush I was using.</li>
            <li> Works great.  Our older Oral-B battery was dying and this was a perfect replacement.  Also fits on the old charger which has a 4 brush storage.</li>
            <li> Except that the buzz tickles my nose, this is the way to brush. I just had a checkup and had almost no scraping of plaque. It&#x27;s a really useful product and all the dentists want you to use something like it.</li>
            <li> I only bought this because it was on sale... way before the horrible Prime Day sales. Definitely noticed a brighter smile in comparison to using conventional toothbrushes. My girlfriend always laughs that there&#x27;s a vibrator in my mouth though....</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t see the need for multiple speeds. Keeps charge all week for 6 brushes a day.</li>
            <li> Used this for the first time today and I love it! It massages the gums very well and leaves your teeth with a nice, clean, polished feeling!</li>
            <li> It works ok, but the on-off button is hard to locate when you&#x27;re brushing.  There was no change in speed when the instructions given were followed. The thing that bothers me most is that they had a gift coupon offer and when you went to that website, it had already been used up by the number of applicants.  But they &amp;#34;gave you a chance to enter a low value sweepstakes&amp;#34; by giving them personal information.  To me this is a scam where each sweepstakes entry is used as a way to get information to a third party for advertising purposes, and Oral-B gets a kickback for supplying this information using a ruse.  I&#x27;d still buy one again but watch out for the scam.</li>
            <li> Because the bush rotates at a high speed, it really cleans along the gum line,which will save me a small fortune in trips to the dentist.</li>
            <li> This is a good toothbrush, nothing too fancy. Does the job.&lt;br /&gt;My only issue is you have to clean the stem and base regularly or you get a bit of grime build up- no way to avoid this really!</li>
            <li> This was recommended on thesweethome.com so I thought it&#x27;d be a great purchase.  You can&#x27;t apply any pressure to your teeth without this thing cutting off.  I really don&#x27;t brush very hard.  I don&#x27;t feel like this cleans my teeth very well.  I will be purchasing a different electric toothbrush just to compare, but if this is the quality I can expect, i&#x27;ll stick to manually brushing.</li>
            <li> I used to have the vitality. I did have it for several years so it is not surprising that the battery was completely dead by the end, but this toothbrush seems to last a lot longer. Otherwise it is a similar product. Although there are claims of another dimension of oscillation it is not noticeable. The extra battery allows it to be taken on short trips of a few days without bringing the base. Furthermore the base has a smaller male part and a wider flat part which makes it easier to clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only negative for me is the flashing light that tells you its charging. This is unnecessary, and since I have a community bathroom and keep the toothbrush in my room, quite annoying.</li>
            <li> so far so good. had for about 4 months charged about 3 times. the toothbrush is strong so there are days when i dont feel well and using this made me feel nauseous believe it or not. I think doesits task well of cleaning however... shall update after my next visit to the dentist...</li>
            <li> Good power.  I also like that it signals time for each quarter and the battery does not need recharging often.</li>
            <li> This electric tooth brush will cut off and on while you are brushing your teeth.  It is NOT related to pressing the brush against your teeth.  Other than that, it&#x27;s a nice tooth brush.</li>
            <li> I bought this electric toothbrush for second time !It works great make my teeth clean and comfortable!And I like the design too!it&#x27;s beautiful !I will buy another one for my mom !I would also like to recommend it to anyone who needs an electric toothbrush!</li>
            <li> the electric brush was so cheap. It has battery charge indicator and low battery indicator. so you can know the battery status. it worth 26 dollars. trust me</li>
            <li> My teeth are cleaner than ever. Love it.</li>
            <li> To start with the negative:  I preferred my former (abt 10 years old) Oral-B elec. toothbrush in that I didn&#x27;t have to recharge it as often.  I use the brush once a day and use a manual brush at night.  This has been my habit for years.  With the new Oral-B, I have to recharge it twice a week, which, granted isn&#x27;t a big deal but it is twice as often as with my old elec. brush.  Also, it takes forever to recharge--much longer than before.  I think it does a good job.  Guess I will find out when I go to the dentist.  Also, I just ignore the buzzing that tells you wheh to move from one section of your mouth to another.  There are enough things beeping and buzzing and vying for my attention as it is.</li>
            <li> You can pay more buying online and if you do you probably have a good reason. You definitely will pay more at your local pharmacy department. However, this is great value and dollar for dollars you cannot do better.</li>
            <li> This is my third oral-B electric toothbrush and they all seem to be great.  My teeth and gums feel very clean after using it.</li>
            <li> Does a very good job.  Almost like having your teeth cleaned at the dentist.  Only drawback is that it take about 12 hours to recharge.</li>
            <li> Good product without any frills. Personally I prefer a product that has a simple operation without too many frills. The only annoying aspect for me is the timer that alerts you to change quadrants after 30 seconds. I would prefer the 2 minute alert and nothing more. There is no way that I could find to turn off the 30 second alert. However this is a minor point compared to the build quality and value for money. The product is recommended for those who take their dental care seriously and want an affordable electric toothbrush that works flawlessly.</li>
            <li> I use it but aim skiierd it may damage my implant  because it is to rough  when I brush my teeth  why I hate it</li>
            <li> Teeth feel clean (this is my first electric toothbrush).&lt;br /&gt;Good for fitting smaller mouths.&lt;br /&gt;Charging is easy.&lt;br /&gt;It gets messy but it&#x27;s easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;Recommend.</li>
            <li> Works great and gets the job done in a very short amount of time. Combine it with flossing and you are on your way to healthy gums and teeth. The only thing that i don&#x27;t like is that the brush head is small and i need to reapply toothpaste between doing the top set and bottom. Love it! It really does whiten and get at the plack better and i have gotten rid of coffee stains.</li>
            <li> German made, what a difference.  Everything worked even the brushhead is better quality compared to my travel Oral B Pro Health (battery operated, which is a real pain to open and change out batteries) which is made in China.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Spinning at much higher RPM than my traveling one, I cant wait to have dental checkup to see if this thing (which cost just a tad more than Pro Health) really cleans better (I have considered the Rotadent for sometime but eventually rejected it because of the poor battery technology and high price in brushhead replacements).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I actually do like the 30 seconds stutter reminder to brush different quadrant whereas before I have to watch my clock to do so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only wish I have is the charger (which is really compact) can be used internationally (which at 110 it is not) so I can travel with it.  So I am stuck with continuing using the Pro Health (which is about same size as the 1000) for travel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: 10-10-2014&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like this product so much bought another identical one.  I started using the first one on a consistent basis  for the last few months--ie-- brushing for exactly 2 minutes (30 seconds per quadrant) using the stutter reminder and guess what, my dental checkup came back flying colors, almost no plague.  That has never happened to me before because I have not been brushing properly time wise or using the wrong kind of toothbrush.  I really felt the round rotating brush head is a joy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also per instruction to once and awhile run charges all the way to zero.  From full charge I usually get about 5 days (twice daily) brushing, then red light will flash.  Then I just keep using for few more days to totally run battery down before charging full.</li>
            <li> It does an excellent job of cleaning my teeth for the price. I have always used this brand and have never found its performance substandard.</li>
            <li> This is the first real electric tooth brush I&#x27;ve had (tried the cheap Crest Spin brush, but nothing on this level) and I did a lot of research ahead of time and decided the reviews and the price was the most reasonable with this brush.  I absolutely love it.  My mouth and teeth feel very clean once I&#x27;m done and my teeth are already looking whiter.  The brush is small enough that I can reach all the way to the back teeth.  The bristles are hard enough to feel like you got a good clean but soft enough that it doesn&#x27;t hurt your gums.  I like the vibrating timer for the 4 quadrants as well - it&#x27;s gentle but noticible.  My husband was skepticle and thought it would be like the Crest Spin brush but he tried mine and also really noticed the difference - so we got him one too and he really loves it as well.  I think this is a great product and easy to transition to from regular brushes - the base is also small so doesn&#x27;t take up much space in the bathroom.</li>
            <li> For many years I&#x27;ve used the Oral B budget version (appx. $20) of their pro electric toothbrush and loved it. The strong motor and small head just works so much better than most other brand of electric toothbrushes and infinitely more cleaner than using a manual brush. Since the design elements on the budget versions are similar to the pro versions and uses the same toothbrush head, I thought the budget Oral B electric toothbrush was just as good as the more expensive Oral-B Pros.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, when I got an Oral-B 1000 Pro Care Electric Toothbrush, the differences were very noticeable! I felt like I went from a classy compact car to a luxurious full-size premier sedan! The motor on the Oral-B 1000 is much more refined. The body is taller and more slender. It makes for a much better brushing experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of my unexpected pleasures of the Oral-B 1000 Pro toothbrush is the built in timers. One goes off once every 20 seconds to remind you to move onto the next section of your teeth. Then the 2-minute warning saying you&#x27;ve completed the recommended minimum time to brush your teeth. Nice! One kept me from working too fast, the other reminded me that it&#x27;s time to finish up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like the small round toothbrush head. It reaches to the back teeth, gets into tight corners, and is able to give a good scrub in every dental nook and cranny. The blue bands fade over time to remind you to replace the toothbrush head after a while. (Con: I&#x27;m not fond on how expensive the toothbrush head replacements are - yikes!) Surely, the round brush head give me the best clean. No other toothbrush shape comes close.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m loving the Oral-B 1000. It&#x27;s an excellent toothbrush and a pleasure to use. It makes for a better tooth-brushing experience for me. I&#x27;ll never go back if I can help it.</li>
            <li> Electric brushes can be a good thing - there is quite a bit more cleaning action going on because the automatic brush strokes are way faster than your hand can perform so you will always get better cleaning.  Also, I have found the rotating action of the head allows you to position it in hard-to-reach areas and then just allow it to do its work, whereas it&#x27;s much less likely to get sufficient cleaning action manually - especially if, like me, you still have some wisdom teeth left and you are concerned about keeping them from decaying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also am an &#x27;over-brusher&#x27;, so I tend to brush too long and too vigorously, and have caused some unneccessary gum receding and enamel damage.  That&#x27;s one caution I would make with the electric toothbrushes - you get plenty of brushing action and &#x27;more&#x27; is not necessarily better.  Sometimes a light brushing and some flossing or toothpick action would serve you better than long, intense brushing.  This brush has a light pause built into it to let you know you are brushing too hard - probably a good thing for those of us so interest in dental hygiene that we will buy these gizmos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One reason I got interested in the electronic toothbrushes, is I tend to brush up and down too hard and I was causing both irritation and receding in a couple areas of my gums and a friend mentioned that her dentist said the rotary-action of these brushes can help correct that a bit - sure enough, I found I stopped making my gum sore every time I brushed, plus brushing was so much more enjoyable in general.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started a few years back with the cell-type battery powered brushes, but they always tended to die on me in a few months, so about a year and a half ago, I went to Oral-B&#x27;s cheapest re-chargeable  model.  I had absolutely no problems with it.  When I went to the dentist recently after not having gone for over twenty years, they seemed to think my teeth were in outstanding shape, except for the fact that I was over-brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The difference in the smooth-running feel of this nicer tooth-brush versus the cheaper Oral-B one is pretty noticeable - the same level of difference I noticed when going from the cell-type battery brushes to my first Oral-B rechargeable one.  Both rechargeable models have the built-in &#x27;three big pauses&#x27; signal to let you know you have brushed for a full two minutes, however, I am re-thinking whether I need to follow the 2-minute recommendation every time I brush, since over-brushing is the greatest bane my teeth have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A couple recommendations:  This brush will accomodate the &#x27;dual-action&#x27; heads, and once I tried those, going back to the single action was really lame.  Dual-action rocks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, in case you don&#x27;t know, always take the head off of the brush, rinse well, and leave it off to dry, just putting back on the next time you brush.  This should keep any bacteria from growing in the brush head.  If you still notice a smell of bacteria, or just want to make sure to get it extra clean, use very hot water when rinsing or even have a spray bottle of strong alcohol available to spray into the bottom of the brush head before you lay it down to dry out.  I noticed a change in brushing heads was called for in anywhere from three to six months, not because the bristles wear down, but the head becomes slightly looser and it would sort of start pinching my gum or tongue a bit as my skin could get slightly caught between the loose plastic.  The miser in me wants to continue until the head simply falls apart, but it&#x27;s much better to just break down and get a new one at that point, thereby avoiding the discomfort, and getting back to enjoying the luxury of a nice electronic toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I followed the instructions in the package of my last rechargeable to allow the battery to completely drain every three months or so.  This is a bit of a challenge, because the brush turns off by itself, so even though you leave it off the charger, once it&#x27;s worn down a bit, it will stop and turn off, even though it is not completely drained.  I found that simply hitting the &#x27;on&#x27; button as many times as I could as I went by, I was able to get it down to truly dead, but it generally requires using the bush manually for a day or so, until it is completely dead and then you can charge it back up.  I did this because I wanted my brush to last as long as possible and will do it with this new one too.  I&#x27;m assuming it does something like clear the memory on the battery when you allow it to go completely dead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two of my personal dental hygiene recommendations:  Be a bit careful about using baking soda or toothpastes with strong abrasives if you are an &#x27;over-brusher&#x27; which can cause even more worn enamel.  Also, &#x27;tartar control&#x27; products are highly under-rated in my opinion.  I personally feel the chemicals in pastes and rinses that say &#x27;tartar-control&#x27; really work, although I will admit, my dentist doesn&#x27;t seem one bit impressed with them.  Still, I used these products faithfully for the 20 years I had no professional dental care, and I had hardly any tartar build-up when I got my teeth cleaned, whereas previously, I did not use the products, and went to the dentist every 6 months and they seemed to find a reasonable amount of tartar to scrape off each time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, this is a wonderful product that makes an annoying daily-plus chore downright enjoyable and keeps your teeth looking and chewing nicely.  Just don&#x27;t over-brush.f, even though it is not completely drained.

            <li> It was a surprise to find that a smaller round brush head could work so much better than a standard larger round head or oval head electric toothbrush. This smaller brush head also had a strong massaging action which felt great on my gums. With the smaller size head, I could get to all the hard to reach dental surfaces such as the back of the very posterior molars plus the inside of the incisors and canines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The handle itself is slightly grooved so that it is less likely to slip when damp.  It&#x27;s much thinner than other electric toothbrushes, so it is less tiring to hold. The design is slender and sleek with a narrow charging base that takes up less space on a bathroom counter top. The unit also has a timer so you can insure you are actually brushing long enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After brushing for three minutes or more twice a day for a week, my teeth felt extra clean similar to the feeling I get after I&#x27;ve received a professional teeth cleaning.  I was surprised that a smaller brush head could be so much more efficient, but indeed it was compared with my SoniCare electric toothbrush which costs twice as much. In my opinion, purchasing this Oral-B 1000 electric toothbrush is a good investment not only to get cleaner teeth but also to benefit from an efficient gum massage!</li>
            <li> i had one for 10 years started to have battery problems , replaced it with tis one ,  so happy i did , love how it works , good buy ,hope it last 10 years ,,</li>
            <li> I bought this toothbrush for replacement to my 12 year old Braun / Oral B electric toothbrush who was still working fine until my girlfriend drop it on the floor! ;)&lt;br /&gt;This electric toothbrush is more powerfull than the old one, I&#x27;m really amazed by the head pulsing speed!&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this electric toothbrush for everyone who want to keep her teeth clean!</li>
            <li> oh yea baby works great</li>
            <li> What went wrong?  This model feels very rough on the gum.  The last one kept going and going but began to feel the brush head was hammering rather than smooth vibration I used to feel.  Expected the same smooth action from a new brush but no.  Returning this and trying out a different brand with a different mode of brushing.</li>
            <li> This is the toothbrush that my regular dentist, as well as my periodontist; recommended that I use years and years ago.</li>
            <li> Why rush a battery only two days</li>
            <li> Performance was very rough.  Brush heads were stiff.</li>
            <li> It only has one speed and the brush felt harder on the gum comparing to my previous one (which was gone after 10 years, it had two speed).  It does not have the 30 second reminder to change sides either. The price was okay with a clip coupon.  It does the job but the quality is not as good as my previous one I got from costco, which I did not find online.</li>
            <li> I ordered this item and it looks like it is supposed to come with a holder for extra brush heads.  Mine did not.  I tried to leave a customer feedback but it was not on the list. I really like that option for this because my bf and I were going to share it.  Disappointed that the picture did not accurately represent the product I was getting.</li>
            <li> My dental hygienist recommended this and it does a great job.</li>
            <li> Weak motor in the unit.  The power fades in and out at certain angles.</li>
            <li> After years of scrubbing my teeth with dollar store electric tooth brushes, my dentist recommended me to get a &amp;#34;professional level&amp;#34; toothbrush because of poor brushing habits and extremely red gums (and I am a non-smoker). This toothbrush makes it so simple to brush your teeth. Just power it on and hover the brush head over your teeth and watch your dental health improve immediately. The battery life on this brush is very nice and I only charge it once every 3-4 days. The only thing that might bring the experience down is the replacement heads. They are over priced compared to  the aftermarket heads and make the cost of maintaining this brush a hassle. Regardless I would definitely recommend this to a friend.</li>
            <li> My dentist wanted me to buy something similar at his office for $149.  I think this one cost me $19.99.  Works fine, does the job, simple, no problem.</li>
            <li> Love this tooth brush. Gets your teeth almost as clean as a professional cleaning. Would definitely buy this product again.</li>
            <li> This is great I love it my teeth are clean and it&#x27;s helping my gums that use to bleed when I brushed my teeth. I like when it let&#x27;s you know to switch sides when brushing, and stays charged for a good amount of time.</li>
            <li> Easy to use. Simple to keep clean. Mouth feels good after using. Used different brand and was hard to clean.</li>
            <li> So far this electric toothbrush machine has been holding up well. For two people to use it, it needs to be charged every five days, but that makes sense since I read somewhere that it will go twice a day for seven days before a recharge. I will update this post if anything goes wrong. German-made, so that means it has some quality at least.</li>
            <li> the toothbrush is heavy,it has a beautiful shape and  good quality.U will find it is totally worth it.We love it !</li>
            <li> This was my first experience with an electric toothbrush - and I purchased it as a suggestion from my dentist.  Not sure why I waited so long!  Best way to get your teeth clean - you can feel the difference!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hayley Ninnis&lt;br /&gt;West Chester, PA</li>
            <li> love it i wish i had bought one a long time ago thanks for agreat product will try it for a while and look for another</li>
            <li> This toothbrush works great! And it was not expensive at all! I would definitely recommend this brush. That&#x27;s about it!</li>
            <li> This is the best electric tooth brush I have owned.  The one I bought in 1997-98 died on me last mo.  I got this one, can see the upgrade, takes the same brush I stocked up on, and is the best.</li>
            <li> - Great price&lt;br /&gt;- Works great&lt;br /&gt;- Looks good&lt;br /&gt;- VERY durable (I drop it all the time)&lt;br /&gt;- Charges fast and lasts a long time&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best electric toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
            <li> After debating between this and the Phillips toothbrush, I bought this one solely because of the smaller rounder brush head. I feel they clean better especially hard-to-reach places like the back teeth. My husband has never liked any electric toothbrush before but he says he likes this one because he feels it leaves his teeth cleaner than any of the other ones we&#x27;ve used before. They are a tad bit loud as one of the other reviewers mentioned but I can live with it for 2 minutes twice daily.</li>
            <li> So the Precision 1000 works really well. The battery lasts a long time, and it does a pretty decent job at getting in between teeth (of course it&#x27;s no replacement for flossing). I can&#x27;t really compare this to other electric tooth brushes as I&#x27;ve never owned any, but this seems to do the job nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The timing feature on the brush lets you know when 30 seconds has passed so you can move on to another quarter of your mouth, and then finally when two minutes are up and you&#x27;re all done. This works pretty well, but not brushing long enough was never a problem for me. I kind of wish I could deactivate this feature (especially since you can&#x27;t pause it to spit).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While the brush handle itself is nice and quiet, the brushing heads that come with the brush are a little loud. Not &amp;#34;I need ear plugs&amp;#34; loud, but definitely &amp;#34;hey guys, guess who&#x27;s brushing their teeth in the bathroom!&amp;#34; loud. If your spouse is a light sleeper, maybe this would be a problem? Not sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, for some reason Amazon has the brush pictured with a large base. It doesn&#x27;t come with one. It&#x27;s just a compact little stand. It charges the brush wirelessly, which is cool, and I honestly prefer the smaller base. Don&#x27;t know why they picture it having a base like that. I believe that&#x27;s the base that actually comes with the Precision 3000 instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over all, great tooth brush. The charge lasts long enough that you can travel with this brush easily. I recommend it.</li>
            <li> This is a nice basic electric toothbrush.  Nothing fancy about it but it works.  My only issue is the two minute timer.  I wish you could set the interval because my dentist recommends 3 minutes.  Still a good purchase.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just like coming the from the dentist&#x27;s office after having my teeth cleaned.  Great product that I would recommend highly.</li>
            <li> A great toothbrush to take when we travel. It has just the right heads and is rechargeable. My husband and I both have one</li>
            <li> I love this product - my mouth feels so clean and do not even feel the need for flossing. Highly recommended</li>
            <li> I found it to be better than just brushing with a regular toothbrush.  My teeth felt a lot cleaner and the tiny round head made it easier to reach areas I could not reach before.</li>
            <li> great product! i really like it. it&#x27;s easy to use and recharge.  after some days it really can whiten my tooth.</li>
            <li> This is a great basic, no bells, no whistles electric tooth brush.  I have had the fancier ones but this one performs just as well!  So save yourself about $30 and purchase this one instead!</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush, I bought 2 of them and my husband and I are very satisfied.</li>
            <li> This thing has lasted me several years now and I&#x27;m sure helped keep my dentist bills down.</li>
            <li> Good brush, though I found it a bit too powerful and not as smooth or comfortable as the Oral b junior sensitive electric brush.  Also, the photo here is misleading, there&#x27;s NO extra brush head dock that comes with this brush, only the small charger came with it. Thus only 3 stars...</li>
            <li> This was just what I was looking for.  An Oral-B handle that would work with the Oral-B heads that I already had and as an added plus this worked with the Oral-B app for the iPhone.  The amazing folks at Oral-B allowed their app to work using the microphone.  This functionality is not through Bluetooth, however I didn&#x27;t need the Bluetooth connection (or the extra cost of the fancier handle).</li>
            <li> works great, I really like this brush! stays charged VERY long</li>
            <li> Great quality and price.</li>
            <li> My teeth and gums like this unit!</li>
            <li> I love it!!!! Would definitely recommend buying this one! Feels almost like the professional cleaning at the dentist, without the bill.</li>
            <li> Great product and quickly shipped.</li>
            <li> Excellent toothbrush! We have used them in the past and this was a replacement. Greatly improved. I like the timing mechanism so you can actually brush for 2 minutes without having a watch to keep track of the time.</li>
            <li> Love and use it every day. charge lasts about a week</li>
            <li> Exactly as advertised</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush!  I have always used an Oral B electric toothbrush, but this is like a jet compared to the 2 seater plane it replaced.  It is fast and does the job much quicker than the other one I have.  It leaves your mouth and teeth feeling very clean and my dentist always remarks how well I brush; of course I don&#x27;t tell her I use an electric toothbrush!  I got this on sale for about $30 and it is well worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> Wish I would of gat the sonic...but it works fine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had several Oral B electric toothbrushes over the years, but after this one I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;ll ever buy another.  The charge on the battery only lasts for about 10 brushings and then I have to recharge it.  Recharging takes about a day, so in effect I can&#x27;t use the electric toothbrush for 1 or 2 days per week.  I&#x27;m giving it 2 stars because, when the battery has juice, the toothbrush functions just fine.</li>
            <li> Works perfectly well.  Holds satisfactory charge.  Only complaint--on/off switch is a little difficult to find by touch.</li>
            <li> This is a great toothbrush. The battery lasts a long time. Really like the 30 second timer. I would recommend this to anyone who wants a great toothbrush but doesn&#x27;t care to spend a ton of money on the higher priced versions.</li>
            <li> I decided to purchase this after my old Oral-B electric toothbrush finally started to loose its strength after 6-7 years. Amazon had by far the best price--I had looked in several local stores. I love that it has the ability to let you know when you&#x27;ve brushed in each area of your mouth for the recommended amount of time. The charger is much smaller than my old one, so it takes up less space. Overall, this is a great product!</li>
            <li> Love it! Stays charged about two weeks and is so much more powerful than others. It takes about a full day to charge it to the full but it will work almost immediately. Live that the charging port is so small too.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband and myself, and we love it. We also bought the additional heads and can&#x27;t see us going back to the regular toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for a few weeks now and it is so much better than the one I had which required batteries. I took it on a week long business trip without the charger and worked fine through out. The smallish brush makes cleaning the far teeth easier.</li>
            <li> its a great brush repllaces A BRAUN  TAT WAS STILEN SO FAR SO GO  OD</li>
            <li> This is a great toothbrush, though the timer can be a bit annoying if you&#x27;re a person who normally brushes their teeth longer than 2 minutes, though it doesn&#x27;t interfere with brushing. I&#x27;m glad I bought it.</li>
            <li> THe button to start the brush doesn&#x27;t work easily and I don&#x27;t think this brush works nearly as well as the oral b brush I had been using.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item because of all of the rave reviews on May 5, 2013.  Today&#x27;s date is December 5, 2013 and it has stopped working.  I have no recourse since this company does not offer replacement or refunds longer than 30 days.  I am not even able to contact this manufacturer to complain about the short life of this product.  My other Oral B Professional toothbrush lasted over 2 years.  I feel this product was deficient and I am angry because there is no recourse.  I will never purchase another Oral B product and  will tell anyone who will listen about this inferior product.</li>
            <li> Been using it awhile.  I like it since I&#x27;m too lazy brushing the teeth right by hand.  I fits my schedule, less time.  The dentist said the teeth are looking good.</li>
            <li> The brush works, my dentist tells me it does a better job than a manual brush, and my check-ups are better.  Need I say more?</li>
            <li> My teeth feel so smooth after using this toothbrush every day with my braces! I love it, it is such a great product.</li>
            <li> This is my first electric toothbrush and I LOVE IT!&lt;br /&gt;the way my teeth look and feel its just awesome! It&#x27;s like going to the dentist to get them clean everyday and that&#x27;s just fantastcic! Looking forward to some ramdom special order to purchase 3 more for my family! If you were having doubts... this is a must! and it&#x27;s cheaper compared to the others!</li>
            <li> This works great and does an amazing job.  Stick with the regular heads, they work the best.</li>
            <li> good product, fast delivery</li>
            <li> Love, Love my toothbrush.  I had purchased a different brand and was totally disappointed.  Went right back to my Oral-B.  Great value for a great product.</li>
            <li> This is great.  I have had two over the years and this one was a gift for my sis.  She was thrilled.  I know, it seems an odd gift.  But now I plan to get some for my kids.  It is one of those devices one often won&#x27;t buy for oneself.  So it makes a great gift.</li>
            <li> I like this brand, I brought this for my father as a replacement.</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush, I like how small the head is to make it super easy to clean all angles of the back teeth. I highly recommend buying the extra soft bristles, before I got this electric toothbrush my dentist was always telling me to brush softer with extra soft bristles. This toothbrush has enough power that with the other heads I could see going overboard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I am not a fan of is how loud it is, I have never used an electric toothbrush so they all be this loud but I feel I need to close the bathroom door so the whole apartment does not hear me brush my teeth. But that is just me, my boyfriend thinks it is a silly concern.</li>
            <li> very cheap, Overall a great product for its price.</li>
            <li> Best I have had.  Zero plaque on my teeth now.</li>
            <li> Bought this to replace an old one.  Love this thing.  Will change your mouth.</li>
            <li> works as well as the more expensive Oral-B electric tooth brushes I have purchased.</li>
            <li> Cute color (hey, I&#x27;m a girl!), powerful, and holds its charge well. Ordered 3(!) for myself and for gifts. Definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> Clean and clear. This gets the job done</li>
            <li> Effective; charges quickly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used an Oral B for 10 plus years. Dental cost down and healthy teeth and gums up! Great price. Good delivery and good value.</li>
            <li> great product, i bought some for my family members, compare to the expensive pro 5000 or pro 7000, it has the same effect, the only daily clean mode can satisfy one&#x27;s normal use already, i have pro 5000 also, but i only use the daily clean mode everyday, so if i can make the decision again, i will buy this pro 1000 for myself directly, i will not pay extra money for the different modes that i do not need.</li>
            <li> Simple, effective, and not that expensive!  I feel like I had my teeth cleaned at the dentist&#x27;s every time I brush my teeth, and after using it for only a week, I really think I notice my teeth getting whiter!  Even flossing wouldn&#x27;t get rid of all of the plaque on my teeth, and my gums were receding because of it, but now even when I pick at my gum-line gently, there&#x27;s no tarter build-up at all.  All I can say is to this toothbrush is, &amp;#34;Where have you BEEN all my life??&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Great shape and speed</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had an electric toothbrush before, so I was unsure as to what I needed to expect. Well, my lack of expectations were happily surpassed. This is the best toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever had. I actually brush for a whole two minutes thanks to the 30 second reminder function (yes, as an adult I didn&#x27;t brush for 2 minutes). The charge dock is extremely convenient, and I have currently had no issues with it retaining a charge on trips I have taken. I would recommend this to anyone looking for an electric toothbrush, especially since I got it on my phone so I saved an extra bit.</li>
            <li> The unit works great and arrived in a timely manner.  The reason I am giving it only two stars is because the toothbrush head storage compartment is not included.  The image of the product clearly has a toothbrush head storage compartment attached to the charging unit.  This is deceptive advertising which I never expected from a company such as Amazon.  The picture needs to be updated!</li>
            <li> These were a better deal here than we could find elsewhere. Very happy with this purchase</li>
            <li> This is my 3rd one. The batteries get pretty crappy at holding a charge after a few years. This model is small and basic, just what I need</li>
            <li> Love it. Much better than my old Sonicare</li>
            <li> Nice, works good except motor burps once in a wile</li>
            <li> Very easy to use.  Prices vary widely:  shop!</li>
            <li> Teeth have never been cleaner.</li>
            <li> The electric toothbrush is very good. But need to pay attention to clean after use it.</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush! Makes your teeth feel like you just had a professional cleaning. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Works just great to keep my &amp;#34;Pearly Whites&amp;#34; in great shape. Easy to hold , just does an exceptional job cleaning.</li>
            <li> A large upgrade from my Panasonic that I purchased many years ago. Have been using it for about a month now and no complaints. Easy to clean, easy to use, and very easy to carry around. Its definitely an electronic toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Works just as the Dentist ordered</li>
            <li> The charger is very small, and the product easy to hold and operate (as well as easy to keep clean). Great!</li>
            <li> We bought two of these.  We had the Oral B Vitality before and it lasted almost 7 years but just began to slow down so we ordered this one.  So far, we are very pleased with it.  The flashing recharge light is helpful to know when it is fully charged.  It spins a lot faster than the Vitality we had before.  It has a smaller &amp;#34;footprint&amp;#34; on the bathroom vanity which is a plus.  The handle is longer and slimmer.  So far, we&#x27;re very happy.</li>
            <li> First one I have ever had, like it quite well seems to do a good job I will find out in 6 months check up if and how much it helped, does take along time to charge up but so far I would buy it again</li>
            <li> I was pleased with the construction and value of this battery operated toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;It cleans well and the brushes seem to hold up nicely.  I get a good 2 weeks of&lt;br /&gt;brushing on a charge.  Good value.</li>
            <li> Awesome fast deliver and at a great price too, packed well and easy to open, works great and about 50% off the price when I ordered :) Happy customer!!</li>
            <li> Great product.  It works like having your teeth cleaned at the dentist.  Easy to use and the battery stays charged for weeks.</li>
            <li> Our teeth are cleaner since we have been using this electric toothbrush. It&#x27;s easy to use, and the results are very good. It is our first time using an electric toothbrush. We highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> It is a good brush.  But I&#x27;ve noticed already the diminished power of the recharged battery.  It is not as advertised for two weeks, more like 4 - 5 days, twice per day.</li>
            <li> I am really happy with ,y new toothbrush. It came really fast amd i think it was worth buying it :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d been fighting the electric toothbrush bandwagon tooth and nail until my dentist told me I needed one. This is great. So much less pressure on my gums, and my teeth still feel clean. The downside, I&#x27;d say, is it takes more effort to clean the roof of your mouth and tongue, but this is a great toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Definitely recommended! It produces a difference right after the first use and lasts most of the day.  Does not replace flossing.</li>
            <li> I got this after a particularly unpleasant cleaning at the dentist due to lots of plaque buildup. The hygienist suggested an electric toothbrush to do a better job of removing plaque at the gumline. I have had this for about two weeks and it&#x27;s great. I would recommend starting to use a toothbrush like this AFTER getting a thorough cleaning at the dentist, so you&#x27;re essentially starting off with a clean slate. Otherwise you&#x27;re likely to find it uncomfortable and have bleeding gums. My teeth feel just as clean as they did the day of my recent cleaning, whereas with a regular toothbrush I&#x27;d probably already be feeling some buildup. I like the internal timer that changes the pulsation to signal it&#x27;s time to move to the next quadrant of the mouth. Very handy.</li>
            <li> It had been 5 years since I had bought my first Oral B Electric toothbrush and I was due for a new one as the old one didn&#x27;t seem to be holding charge very well anymore! SO happy I choose this one. The power is wonderful and I feel like my teeth are nice and clean just like after the dentist again!</li>
            <li> Bought this recently for my girl, it is very nice, battery charge indicator is a cool feature. The brush is much quieter than the older model that I use and it is much slimer. Also the battery lasts for many uses between charges.</li>
            <li> Its powerful and the timer promotes proper brushing. Our teeth are getting whiter just by following the 2 minutes with this brush.</li>
            <li> So far this is a good buy and it is more fun to use this brush. It works well, have good reviews, and it does remove my plaque than my standard brush. Also, this is a no extras on this model which is not bad as a toothbrush should not cost a lot of money.</li>
            <li> I Did Not Like That It Had Only 1 Speed The Brush Has Very Little Power When Pressure Is Applied</li>
            <li> ran out of charge without warning :-(  (nothing else to add. blank blank blank blank  blank blank blank blank blank blank</li>
            <li> Absolutely love the electric toothbrush.I regret not buying one when they first came on the market,I would have saved thousands of dollars in dental bills.My new Dentist recommended this for gum disease in which I&#x27;ve just had to loose two teeth.It spends much faster than you could ever move your manual brush.It gets everywhere in between including at the most important gum line.I have lots to praise and say,but I believe I&#x27;ve said enough.You will not regret it,I promise.While you&#x27;re at it,a Waterpic irrigation set is the second part of the team...Save your teeth while they are still good. :)</li>
            <li> Much better than the battery version. Love it.</li>
            <li> WORKS WELL...MY HUSBAND LOVE IT...</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first. However, 6 month later at my cleaning the dentist asked me what I was doing different, so the results speak for themselves.</li>
            <li> Nice toothbrush.  Works very well.</li>
            <li> Im a dentist and like it. Does just as good as the 200 one without any gimmicks. Just buy one thats rechargable. Double A battery ones slowly die and becomeless effective.</li>
            <li> Works grat. As advertised</li>
            <li> First time I used this brush was like murdering my teeth with mega vibrations.  After a couple days my gums got used to the exceptional cleaning power and now brushing my teeth is so satisfying.  In the month I&#x27;ve had it I definitely see and feel the improved health of my teeth and gums.  One of the better purchases I have made in years.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush exceeded my expectations.  It cleans my teeth well and is attractive while taking up minimal space on my sink.  I would buy the same toothbrush if I need one again.</li>
            <li> My dentist agrees that this toothbrush is effective in cleaning my teeth and reducing the amount of plaque. The charger is small and unobtrusive.</li>
            <li> This is for the Oral-B Professional Healthy Clean Precision 1000.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This does a great job at getting my teeth clean. I&#x27;ve used some other kinds and brands of electric toothbrushes (all more expensive than this one) and I think I like this one the most. I appreciate that it is relatively cheap compared to most of the other options and I think it does at least a good of a job at cleaning my teeth. I like the feature of it letting you know every 30 seconds to change spots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I don&#x27;t like is the way the heads are designed. The part that enters your mouth is not sealed and there is an opening further down the head which is still outside your mouth. I never realized it before but parts of my brushing routine is done with my mouth closed tight around the tooth brush. This just isn&#x27;t possible with this head so I have to continually inhale gently to keep spit from coming out through the toothbrush head. I&#x27;ve gotten used to it but the truth is I still sometimes end up with toothpaste spit down the front of me, a problem I&#x27;ve never had with any other toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only other complaint is the battery. The first one I had went dead within about a month. I sent it in for repair and they replaced the battery. It&#x27;s been about 5 months since then and it seems to be fine now. Still, all of these rechargeable batteries have the same problem: they never last as long as they are supposed to. To prolong the life of the battery I would strongly recommend not putting it on the charger after every use. Wait until the low battery light flashes. I get about 15 brushes per charge. That&#x27;s a pretty reasonable number but unless I&#x27;m very lucky, it won&#x27;t take long before the charge starts dropping off fast.</li>
            <li> replacement for the old one</li>
            <li> Awesome product! I like way better then my Sonicare and it&#x27;s half the price and way easier to clean. Plus the replacement heads are cheaper.</li>
            <li> I loved that this toothbrush was so affordable compared with the usual $125-$150 electrics out there and so far it works!  No complaints.</li>
            <li> With 30 second intervals for each quad it&#x27;s a sure way to ensure clean teeth.  This is a toothbrush for those who wanna keep their teeth clean as possible!</li>
            <li> I bought it for my mother. She loves it and says it cleans her teeth better than a manual toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I bought this toothbrush on a recommendation from my dentist.  He said I was brushing too hard, and that this brush would help keep a good firmness and cleanliness to my brushing.  He was right!  I like that it has a timer to tell you when to switch to other areas of your mouth, and having the brush stop if I push too hard it great too.  I found out you can also put any Oral-B brush head on this model.  Glad I bought this!</li>
            <li> Received item in timely manner.  Item as advertised.  I don&#x27;t like the vibration stop timer.  I should have gotten an audible timer instead.  Solid unit.  Instructions could have been written better.  I got an unadvertised 50% my cost rebate!</li>
            <li> I have the higher end version of this toothbrush that has the timer display and many other features.  But I wanted to buy an extra one for my girlfriend&#x27;s place and this one was perfect for the price.  It doesn&#x27;t have all the bells and whistles of the higher end models, but it cleans your teeth just as well in my opinion.  Great buy!</li>
            <li> I bought this as I read that the Sonicare rotates too quickly for most people&#x27;s gums.  This is easy to clean, easy to charge, and is very simple to operate - which comes in handy when I&#x27;m less-than-awake in the mornings.  There&#x27;s a stutter at 30-sec intervals to help you time your brushing sessions.</li>
            <li> My last one was much better. A display showing the time brushed &amp; happy face at the two minute mark.&lt;br /&gt;It also had a gum setting, sensitive area setting and polish settings. Missed the frills. It does the job and hesitates every thirty seconds so you can time it.</li>
            <li> Finally, an affordable electric toothbrush that tells me when I have had enough.  The replacement tips are expensive, but they last a long time.</li>
            <li> Love this toothbrush!! Just started using it a few days ago. Not sure how much difference it&#x27;ll make yet in terms of cavities reduction. But love it so far. It has 4 30 seconds segments - very useful. Love how strong it is.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Performs very nicely. I purchased at what I believe was an excellent price point. It is a true value. Recommend to everyone. If you do not have a similar product that performs you need this.</li>
            <li> Bought this due to some minor dental issues.  About 15 years ago I bought the same Braun/Oral B system just like this to assist in correcting the same problem.  I loved it then and this one is working just the same but with some improvements.  I like how the mortorized handle has a very nice waterproof coating.  Also, it is helpful that the &amp;#34;timer&amp;#34; goes off every 30 seconds by changing the brush pattern for 2 seconds - so if you are trying to acheive a full 2 minutes with giving equal attention to areas of the mouth, this is helpful.  Also, it does not just shut off instantly after 2 min, it seems to slow down a bit.  From reading the manual, it indicates there are 2 speeds - the second one is &amp;#34;gentle&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;sensitive&amp;#34;, although I have not tried it.&lt;br /&gt;  The only con for me is the bright light.  My bathroom is very small without much counter space.  Therefore, many of my bathroom items are just outside the door on a small/short bookcase next to an outlet.  This is perfect for many things but when I plug this Braun toothbrush into the outlet, there is a large &amp;#34;charge&amp;#34; icon that lights up very bright blue.  This honestly might work as a nightlight in a bathroom if you wanted it too - it is that bright.  However, this is in my bedroom and it is too bright.  I corrected it by putting a small piece of aluminum foil over the light and it blocks it completely and the foil is &amp;#34;water-proof&amp;#34;.  Alternatively, the charge lasts for 14 two-minute brush sessions (or one week of twice per day use), so one could just plug it in when leaving in the morning and unplug at night, then wait another week to do the same.&lt;br /&gt;  Overall, very happy with this item.</li>
            <li> If your looking at this product, your are already thinking about functionality. Even though this model is more towards the basic side of features compared to the other models, it&#x27;s all you need for brushing teeth. Honestly I don&#x27;t think anyone needs timers, a stand, self-cleaning feature, and a pressure sensor for brushing teeth. This brush will do the job just fine. It does have features like, 1 second pauses for every 30 seconds to let you know you need to move on to the next quadrant of your mouth for brushing. A small easy travel charging dock (if you are going to be gone for more than 5 days and have to possibly need to recharge), and easy to understand battery indicators. And above all the price. I bought 2 of these in the same transaction for $27 a piece, at walmart they were $65 a piece. After one month of brushing teeth and before using a traditional tooth brush, I noticed a significant improvement.</li>
            <li> My first electric tooth brush and all I can say is it does the job well. We&#x27;ll see how well it goes over time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had an electric toothbrush before, but my dentist recommended I get one after my latest cleaning, reminding me that I needed to brush for 2 full minutes, because otherwise it simply isn&#x27;t effective, and that the electric softer can do a better job anyways while reminding us how long we&#x27;ve brushed.  This basic product is awesome.  You can FEEL when the brush has hit a 30 second mark (it does a 1/4 second &amp;#34;stop&amp;#34; twice) and the continues brushing, so you can move to a new quadrant of your mouth.  Once it hits 2 minutes, it does a longer stop sequence, then continues brushing if you want to brush more (your tongue perhaps?). Overall, this is much better than regular toothbrushes, with a really unobtrusive charger, so I won&#x27;t ever be going back to regular brushes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these tooth brushes for years.  I&#x27;ve tried other ones, but this is perfect.  Don&#x27;t need the higher cost models and much better than the Oral-B Vitality.</li>
            <li> Great product , very simple works well easy to clean I wish I had got it before, cleaning is very easy too you just put it in the water</li>
            <li> i got this for my husband after he saw how much i liked my own.  he said it makes his teeth feel like they do after a dental cleaning!how good is that!??</li>
            <li> Saved 25% over price at Target. This is a great product. It&#x27;s my second one in five years. Would buy another.</li>
            <li> Not too many frills, and not too basic. this model is all I need.  30 sec timers are very useful.</li>
            <li> The base was not balanced and it did not connect with the brush. I found it to be an inferior product. I would not recommend this to anyone. I am sorry I did not return it .</li>
            <li> Far exceeds my old Phillips sonic brush. This brush is worth every penny &amp; more. The most satisfactory purchase of anything that I&#x27;ve made in a long time. Watch out for fake \\&quot;Oral B\\&quot; replacement heads that aren&#x27;t made by Oral B -- as reported in other reviews here. (They say buy from Amazon, not from a store that sells through Amazon.)</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush. My dental hygenist recommended this model. Easy to use and holds a charge for travel. I would have liked a carrying case, but none is included.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased the Oral-B Professional Care 1000 Electric Rechargeable Power toothbrush and am totally delighted with it. I have no negative comments, works well and quietly with vibrating alerts for every 30 seconds of brush time. My teeth definitely feel cleaner and look brighter.</li>
            <li> Coffee + teas w/ fruits (especially the blueberry) had resulted in significant staining of these older teeth, requiring significant efforts by the hygienist to clean them up. At the urging of the professionals, acquired the Oral-B and have reduced the staining by at least 90%.  The only down side is the induction recharging, which requires a good 15 to 17 hours for full recharge. So, if the low battery shows at night and set to recharge, the unit will not be fully recharged until the following evening. A charge lasts about a week, used twice a day, consistent w/ the informational pamphlet. But if more than one person uses it, that really cuts down the use time, and that&#x27;s where the overly long recharge period is an issue. \\&quot;Constant\\&quot; recharge would likely solve the issue, but at the cost of reducing the life of the battery itself. Yes, the induction system has no exposed contacts, looks \\&quot;neat\\&quot;, etc., but sacrifices efficient recharge time (maybe that&#x27;s why these are also available as 2-unit packs). Overall, the Oral-B has done wonders for the teeth, but the excessive recharge time gets the product 4 stars, not 5.</li>
            <li> Having used other electronic toothbrushes, I found this one brushes harder than others and isn&#x27;t as soft bear the gum line. Also, the neck of the brush is bigger than others and I find toothpaste easily runs down the brush when brushing</li>
            <li> These are powerful brushes and do a great job.  I like the fact I can store this in the cabinet between brushing and charge only as needed.</li>
            <li> Works great!  I love the timer feature.</li>
            <li> Just what the dentist recommended!!</li>
            <li> I bought this as a replacement for an older Oral-B power toothbrush because I was fed up with the effort required to clean the charging base. With this model, I just run some warm water over it every few days, and voila. No more crud collection on the base and the bottom of the toothbrush. I also like the 30 second timer. No more need to count myself to know when to switch to another area of the mouth. Another reviewer mentioned that it&#x27;s only 110V so not suitable for travel to countries with 220V power. True, but I travel a lot and I prefer to bring a disposable power toothbrush that doesn&#x27;t require a charger, so in my eyes that is not a problem. I can wholeheartedly recommend this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Bought this product on my hygienist&#x27;s recommendation and absolutely cannot believe the difference.  Very user friendly, portable, and the charge lasts a long time.  Am very satisfied and like that other brushes can be interchanged in the unit for other family members.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had an issue with brushing manually and therefore have held off buying an electric toothbrush. For a variety of reasons (temporary price drop to $50 on Amazon, $20 mail-in rebate, 5% credit card bonus points from purchases from Amazon with one of my credit cards from Jan1 thru Mar31, 2012), I thought I&#x27;d give this a try since my overall commitment would be under $30.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought the Oral-B Professional Care 1000 after checking the various Amazon reviews from others of their various models. I also bought a 3-pack of the floss action brush heads for future use. So far, I&#x27;ve used the included standard brush head with my 1000 brush for about a week. My impressions:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-as I read the product info and some folks&#x27; reviews, I thought the 30-sec stutter timer was a bit of a gimmick. But having used the brush for about a week now, I like knowing when my quarter-mouth 30-sec period is complete so I can brush for the recommended 2 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-I had no issues with initial gum bleeding and am happy with the results of brushing with the 1000 compared to my earlier manual brushing. I generally buy extra soft bristles for my manual toothbrushes so I expected I&#x27;d need to buy the Sensitive brush heads for the 1000, but I&#x27;m happy with the standard brush head that came with the 1000.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-initially, I didn&#x27;t think the 1000 was doing a better job than my manual brushing that I&#x27;ve been doing now for over 60 years, BUT... I do think that my morning flossing goes easier since switching to the 1000, so I will confess that maybe the 1000 does better than my old manual brush has done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-even with the cost of replacement heads, I expect to keep using and preferring the 1000 over manual brushing into the future. I will say though, that if my 1000 dies, I&#x27;ll wait for a good sale on a replacement rather than run right out and buy a replacement the day the 1000 died. I still could easily live with manual brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-the one issue I have with my 1000 is that I tried to test the pressure sensor alert to see what the result would be and what level of pressure the brush considers to be too much. Maybe my unit is defective or maybe I don&#x27;t know what to expect, but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve experienced an alert from my 1000 when pressing too hard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just one more cute observation--when looking to buy this toothbrush, I did also check a well-known internet auction site--yes, that one--and was very surprised to observe that in addition to Sellers offering new units, some sellers were offering \\&quot;slightly used\\&quot; electric Oral-B Pro Care model 1000 toothbrushes.

            <li> My old tooth brush broke and it was a lot more expensive. Was very happy when this won came. Great especially for the price!</li>
            <li> This is my second Oral-B Toothbrush.  My old one is over 15 years old, and actually still works.  My new one has a few new features to make it even better, like the timer notes every 30 seconds of the 2 minute time, by vibrating, to let you move to another area of teeth cleaning.  My dental tech who cleans my teeth, thinks that my gums and teeth are in very good condition, with the electric toothbrush.  I at one time had surgery on my gums, but have had no further problems with my Oral-B use. I consider this an excellent product.</li>
            <li> Great value.  Seems very powerful.  A bit noisy compared to another brand I recently had.  Overall, very pleased.</li>
            <li> Product description is not accurate: there is no pressure indicator on this toothbrush and it does not stop if you apply too much pressure—press as hard on it as you like and the motor keeps going. It&#x27;s still a perfectly good electric toothbrush otherwise, though I really did want something that would warn me when I brushed too hard.</li>
            <li> Our last one lasted for 16 years.  Perfect.</li>
            <li> For wife.  She loves it.  Replacement for similar older model.  Great price.</li>
            <li> excellant toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Works really well.  These things last.  My brother has had his for about 10 years so far. I personally put the charger on a switch so I only charge it when it needs it.  It saves power too.</li>
            <li> This thing is fantastic. Used it for almost 2 years with no issues and you cannot beat the price!</li>
            <li> I works fine and cleans my teeth. I bought it to replace my old Oral-B electric toothbrush which I bought for $20 many years ago.  The perfomance if this toothbrush is a little better and I like the brush head. Therefore the price is right.  Delivery was prompt and good.</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush but hard to find replacement heads.</li>
            <li> Had one before for like 15 yrs. to replace and really good. If it last as long well worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;Does everything you want and need from an electric tooth brush.</li>
            <li> Better dental check ups and cudos from the dental hygienist</li>
            <li> I got this for $25 after rebate from walmart.com yesterday, I already love it.  I timed myself with a regular toothbrush &amp; realized I&#x27;ve always only brushed for less than a minute.  This electric toothbrush pulsates after every 30 seconds so I know when to move on to the next quadrant of my mouth.  I never knew why I couldn&#x27;t get all the white off my tongue with a regular toothbrush, this Oral-B removed all the white the first time!&lt;br /&gt;You can get generic replacement heads for about $1 each by searching ebay for \\&quot;oral-b precision heads\\&quot; (about $3.33 each for oral-b brand replacement heads).</li>
            <li> Let me begin with mentiong that i have sensitive gums. Brushing everyday used to be an average episode of true blood(minus the s3x obviously). I was used to it. I then bought this toothbrush on an impulse and what a find.&lt;br /&gt;Some points to note would be&lt;br /&gt;- Gums bleed for a week or so and then its reduced drasticallly. Using the oral b sensitive heads. Miracle!&lt;br /&gt;- i still have not nailed the art of brushing with this without drooling a bucket worth of saliva. Could be a user error.&lt;br /&gt;- charge holds good for a couple of weeks for me. YMMV&lt;br /&gt;- brush is big enough to be used as a club in emergency situations. Thats a plus in my book!</li>
            <li> Solid powerful motor, good brush. Price is decent for the quality. Have been using it for a few months now and it lasts days without charging.</li>
            <li> Everything works great and the toothbrush is able to really clean my teeth so that they feel smooth. It doesn&#x27;t hurt on the gums and is small enough to reach difficult areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I knocked a star off because waste accumulates on the base for both my daughter and I. If the charger and base of the toothbrush were clean (ie, side charging port) then I would give it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> Great value from OralB</li>
            <li> A gift for a person who didn&#x27;t like to brush his teeth and, like me, now finds it enjoyable, including a light massage of the gums.  A relaxing way to do a good job of brushing, complete with timer to let one know when they have reached 2 minutes of brushing.  In practice I always go beyond 2 minutes.  Smaller brush makes getting back side of back teeth much easier.</li>
            <li> Buy this if you are looking for a rechargeable toothbrush. I really don&#x27;t understand why anyone would pay 2/3/4 times as much for the same thing from oral-b with additional features. This has everything you need. It tells you when the battery is low and buzzes every 30 seconds for 2 minutes to ensure you get all sections of your mouth and brush your teeth for the recommended 2 minutes. The electric toothbrush has really helped with my dental hygiene overall and makes a big difference from the standard toothbrush (especially if you are like me and don&#x27;t floss).</li>
            <li> Love these tooth brushes.  Great for dental health, compact with reasonably priced replacement brushes.&lt;br /&gt;Bought two for our grandsons as gifts.</li>
            <li> Just what you would expect in an electric toothbrush head! Not too rough and does a fine job removing plaque.  The bristles fade when it&#x27;s time to replace.</li>
            <li> Great cleaning.  I used to have a Phillips sonicare and I believe this one cleans better.  It is quite a vibration on your gums though if that bothers you.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d used battery operated toothbrush for years, but it seemed like I had to replace them about every 3rd or 4th time the batteries needed replacing.  Then moved on to an Oral B Vitality and what a difference.  I had that for years.  It let you know when you&#x27;d been brushing for 2 minutes and the charge lasted long enough to get me through a 3-day power outage.  Not sure how much longer it would have lasted beyond that.  But alas, it eventually started to feel like it was losing power.  So wow, what a difference when I got this one.  Did the Vitality ever feel this strong?  I&#x27;m not sure now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It took quite a while to charge it up for the first time, so make sure you have something else available, just to play it safe on that first day.  A light blinks to let you know when it&#x27;s charging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Didn&#x27;t think I&#x27;d like the brush head that came with it.  I actually liked an older brush head that just recently you can&#x27;t seem to get anymore that had two brushes on it.  But I was surprised as the design of this head feels like it cups each tooth while doing its job and your teeth actually feel cleaner, almost as smooth as just coming from the dentist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;re notified via a momentary stuttering of the pulse every 30 seconds.  This is designed so that you work on one quadrant of your mouth at a time and eventually trains you to the tempo of how much time to spend on each tooth.  You&#x27;ll also receive additional momentary stutters if you&#x27;re pressing to hard on your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s supposed to last a total of 14 2-minute brushings before the charge is depleted.  They do suggest completely running the charge down every 6 months to make it last longer.</li>
            <li> The product I ordered worked fine, exactly as specified. I personally did not like how hard it vibrated though- I felt a bit like I&#x27;d stuck a power saw in my mouth every time I used it. And yes, I did bleed quite a bit at the gums every time I used it. I know from the manual that that may go away after continued usage, but I just wasn&#x27;t willing to wait on it. To each their own, I suppose.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have a timer like I was hoping for but it gets the job done other wise and its very small</li>
            <li> Love this brush and I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Ordered this for a friend, to give to her fiance&#x27; for Christmas.  He loves the electric toothbrush, and wanted him to have spare brush heads for the new toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I love my electric toothbrush. I will never go back! Each time I go to the dentist they compliment me on how nice my teeth and gums look. I owe it all to the Oral-B electric toothbrush. I haven&#x27;t had any issues with it. and would definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> I bought this toothbrush 2 months ago and have been using it since then. It works amazing! I use it twice a day, it cleans the enamel off the plaque which generally takes a lot of effort while using a normal toothbrush. However, the charging takes a very long time - almost 24 hours. But irrespective of this, the brush is a good buy.</li>
            <li> Bought this in Sept 2013; now in  March 2014, the unit will not charge so it is worthless.  I tried to return to Amazon but the window to return it was only 30 days.  The description indicates there is a 2 year limited warranty but the details were in the packaging which I&#x27;m pretty sure I don&#x27;t have anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very disappointed - expected more from major brand.  Will not purchase another</li>
            <li> The only problem I&#x27;ve had since owing this toothbrush is trying to replace the charger after I forgot it at a hotel.</li>
            <li> My wife and I bought this rechargeable electric brush about 6 months ago. The units work very well and the feeling after cleaning our teeth is great. The brush has last all this time without replacing them although wear and tear is becoming evident. Strongly recommend this product to every one.</li>
            <li> Really strong Brush and the only thing is that the replacement Brushes cost almost just as much as the brush itself. Other then that it&#x27;s a Good brush.</li>
            <li> This was ordered for my granddaughter. Her dentist recommended a power brush with the small round head. The only one I know that fits that description is the Oral B. I am sure it will help if she uses it regularly.</li>
            <li> Brush head seems kind of small. The first charge seems to take a very long time and it doesn&#x27;t seem to hold a charge as long as advertised. Nothing special, no extra setting, just click the button and vibrates.</li>
            <li> Great product, no problems.</li>
            <li> I had another oral B toothbrush which made me buy this one. This one works great and makes my teeth feel like I just left the dentist.</li>
            <li> I purchased this toothbrush back in December and I have nothing but good things to say about it. I know it sounds silly but I feel like it has made brushing my teeth so much more exciting. It does a thorough job of cleaning and even gives very subtle time reminders to keep you on track (vibrates every 30 seconds so that you know to change quadrants, and then vibrates for a longer period after two minutes of brushing). Even my dentist noticed a difference!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a little pricey but it&#x27;s definitely an investment worth making. You really won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
            <li> Love the product, not happy with the rebate. Did not get it, I need a receit.&lt;br /&gt;Didn&#x27;t get one online. Help</li>
            <li> I own both the Philips Sonicare Essence 5300 and the Oral-B Professional Care 1000 and have used both extensively.  They are very different toothbrushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Philips uses sonic technology that causes the brush to vibrate extremely fast without it actually moving much; this subtle quality creates a more pleasant brushing experience than the Oral-B.  It also has a longer more traditional brush that I like better for tongue cleaning, and for getting into certain spaces between teeth.  I find the brush ends too sharp and uncomfortable to use for gum massaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Oral-B has a round brush that acts more like a jackhammer in that it is much more physical and vigorous than the Philips.  I can also apply more pressure with the Oral-B (important for cleaning molars).  These two qualities makes it better for deep cleaning.  The brush is also softer than the Philips, which combined with the \\&quot;vigorous\\&quot; quality makes it better for gum massaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Which one I use depends on what I want.  I use the Oral-B about 65% of the time, the Philips about 35%.  I give the edge to Oral-B since deep cleaning is most important to me, though I&#x27;m still glad I have the Philips for light jobs.</li>
            <li> Awesome, easy to use. Exactly as I was hoping. Powerful when charged and charges quickly.</li>
            <li> The small head is perfect to reach into all of the nooks and crannies of the mouth. No more wasting money on batteries as it&#x27;s rechargeable, and the battery lasts about one week before it needs to be charged.</li>
            <li> I own both a Sonicare and an Oral-B and I like the Oral-B much better because of the round brush.  For me, it felt awkward cleaning the lingual surface of the mandibular anterior teeth with the shape of the brush on the Sonicare.  With the Oral-B, no matter which teeth you&#x27;re cleaning or whatever angle, the round brush is all over it and cleans perfectly.  This difference is huge and on close inspection, I noticed the Oral-B left my teeth cleaner.</li>
            <li> My 10-year-old Oral-B toothbrush was failing - the battery wasn&#x27;t fully charging and the RPMs and power were down - so I decided it was time for a new toothbrush. Since I still had a couple of Oral-B brush tips and because I liked the brand, I decided to stay with Oral-B.&lt;br /&gt;My Precision 1000 arrived yesterday afternoon and I used it for the first time last night.&lt;br /&gt;I was stunned at the speed and power. This thing is like a ferret on meth (in a good way, of course) and left my mouth feeling way fresher and cleaner than did my old brush.&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that the price dropped $10 this week.&lt;br /&gt;Great product. My teeth and gums love it.</li>
            <li> Great tool.  My dentist love s my new look....</li>
            <li> Only gripe is the blinking green light when charging, because the vanity area and outlet are inside my bedroom, so it lights up in the night.</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve gotten this toothbrush for 3 different people as gifts. One was for my mother over a year ago, the second my sister (also over a year ago), and lastly my husband recently got one from me. So far this toothbrush has yet to fail them and they all love it! It works well, leaving them with a clean mouth. It is rechargeable, which is what I always recommend to my patients (I am a dental hygienist). Many people prefer the battery operated ones due to the cheaper price, but when you add up the cost of batteries you&#x27;re really losing money in the long run. Furthermore, rechargeable keeps its energy up, meaning it spins better than it does with a dying battery. Also, for the cost this is almost just as good as the much more expensive rechargeable toothbrushes. Sure the bells and whistles aren&#x27;t all there but you&#x27;ll still get a clean smile that will make your hygienist proud of you. Just be sure to brush 2x/day for 2 full minutes, floss at least 1x/day (no matter how good of a toothbrush you have you still have to floss), brush your tongue via tongue scraper 2x/day, and use your antimicrobial mouthwash for a full 30 seconds 2x/day. Do this and your dentist will love you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I highly recommend this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I love it! It really clean my teeth. After you brush, you can feel your teeth surface feel just right after ur dentist visit. I had oral-b sonic toothbrush 4 yrs ago and I thought that was good but this new one is 1/4 of cost of my old one and does the better job!</li>
            <li> A marked improvement over the older Oral-B toothbrush.  The brushing speed and timing features signal this out as an outstanding performer.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS TOOTHBRUSH!</li>
            <li> I have never purchased an electric toothbrush, so did some research on them. This particular one has a small rotating head which reaches the back of my molars. It was recommended by my dental tech that I purchase one that was really expensive, but felt like there was something out there that would do the job at a reasonable price. The Oral B Pro 1000 charges overnight, lasts me about a week brushing 2 times a day, and leave my gums and mouth feeling clean. What more could anyone ask for?</li>
            <li> like the oral-b rechargeable always had good performance just think I prefer the adjustable speed after this purchase</li>
            <li> This here toothbrush along with some whitening toothpaste, and I have entered a whole new world of clean teeth.  Terrific product and SO worth the relatively small amount of money for it!  Doesn&#x27;t take up much counter space at all, and vibrates powerfully for a good clean.  Time your brush for you so you get the recommended 2 minutes cut into 4ths (one for each quarter of the mouth).  Will stop if you press down to hard.  Only drawback is a 22-hour charge time from bottom to top, and a recommendation to fully discharge the battery at least every 6 months to preserve the rechargeable battery.  But a full battery lasts for 7 days of 2x/day brushing.  Glad I bought this!</li>
            <li> My second Oral-B electric toothbrush.  I love it.  My dentist says it&#x27;s the best.  My gums prove it.</li>
            <li> Just replaced my plain old Oral-B that I have had for years.  This was more than I wanted to spend since I think the last one was about $20, but overall I am very happy.  The battery on this is much better, it charges quickly, and I feel that I get a better clean. I like the timer which the my old one also had so you know how long you need to brush. I also like that it holds a charge for a week so when I travel, I can just bring it with me.  In the past. I left my electronic at home and brought a regular old toothbrush.  I have been using an electronic Oral-B toothbrush for about 15 to 20 years, morning and night. and my dentist consistently tells me I have excellent oral hygiene.</li>
            <li> great quality, works well, great price</li>
            <li> My old Oral-B doesn&#x27;t hold a candle to this new one.&lt;br /&gt;It operates on a very high speed and also holds its&#x27; charge for a long time too.</li>
            <li> Razzle dazzle! Love how clean this makes my mouth feel!</li>
            <li> good for all cleaning purposes-- good for a narrow mouth</li>
            <li> Good product, heads last about as long as the original ones.</li>
            <li> This is an exceptional product and it is a light-weight, slim, and very attractive product.  Easily recommend to anyone.&lt;br /&gt;Packaging is also  typical for Amazon - First Rate!</li>
            <li> Oral B tooth brush is light weight easy to charge I was using a regular toothbrush.  It wasn&#x27;t cleaning my teeth like I would like had to upgrade heard positive things about this product. Cleans my teeth real good I wanted something affordable That work because most Electric toothbrushes cost a arm and a leg came a cross this one.</li>
            <li> I bought this product instead of a Sonicare one just because the price and the available promotion (rebate of 20 bucks).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received my order today. However, I immediately found several suspicious problems. First, the package was already opened. I have bought many stuffs from Amazon and it&#x27;s the first time I received a product in such an opened package. Second, and more suspiciously, the toothbrush gets no energy at all, which in my experience is abnormal for a rechargeable electric product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In summary, I wonder if there is some quality issues with the product.</li>
            <li> This is my second oral b toothbrush purchase, the first one I bought more than 12 YEARS ago! The switch started failing recently so I decided to purchase this model to replace it. At first I thought the price of an electric toothbrush was a bit much, but after using one I will never go back to a manual brush. The clean feeling the oral b delivers cant be matched by manually brushing IMO. This new model I believe is faster than the older model it replaced, if you have never used a brush like this you may need to go a little easy on pressure to get used to it. You may also experience your gums bleeding but eventually that will go away. It seems to take forever to charge this brush, but I just do it overnight and it lasts me a over a week before it needs recharged. I run the brush till the battery is almost dead before i recharge it, this model also has a recharging-charged led which I find handy. I dont hesitate to take this brush with me away from home either, camping-traveling no problem at all. I paid more for the older model than I did this one, IMO it&#x27;s a steal at the price they currently have it listed for!</li>
            <li> This replaces a dead Cybersonic 2 that I had for 12 years. For a really long time now, it wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge - just long enough for me to use it once, then I&#x27;d have to stick it back on the charger again. Then the switch was malfunctioning, so yeah, time for a new one. I picked this model because I wanted to try the Floss Action head, and it was a step up from Vitality which moves at about 1/4 of the speed of this one. The higher models move at twice the speed of this one and have a couple more settings, but then I thought, \\&quot;do I really need that?\\&quot; I thought it might&#x27;ve been overkill, and just didn&#x27;t have a ton of money to spend on a toothbrush this time around. When I lucked out and saw a new one of these on eBay for $27.99/free ship (didn&#x27;t wanna hassle with the rebate), I decided to give it a try. It comes with 1 Precision head, but there was a $3 coupon enclosed, and the Floss Action heads were on sale at Walgreen&#x27;s. So I got a 3-pack of FA heads for $18.99. Not bad for instant gratification. I really like tongue cleaner attachments, so I also managed to order the Mouthcare Essentials kit for $18.99/free ship from Bonanza (I think this kit goes for $45).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it for 3 days. On my first day, my first thought was that it was scary-percussive. I was afraid that it was gonna knock my teeth loose! But I kept using it, and thankfully my teeth are still intact. It is a little loud, but I think they all are. What I like about this type of loud is that it&#x27;s a low-pitched hum - like a really quiet biplane (haha, if you can imagine that) - so it&#x27;s not too annoying. There are stutters to let you know how long you&#x27;ve been brushing, but they&#x27;re easy enough to ignore, and the unit doesn&#x27;t turn itself off. Nice, since I brush for way longer than 2 minutes. It stutters too when you&#x27;re brushing too hard, which is a welcome feature that I didn&#x27;t have before. Having the unit with all my attachments just willy nilly on my counter, or even in a drawer, was driving me nuts, but I found a small bait-and-tackle type case at Daiso for $1.50 that fits everything perfectly (I&#x27;ll try to  post a pic). A pencil case would&#x27;ve done the trick too, but Target&#x27;s assortment wasn&#x27;t so good this year. My Cybersonic had head covers and a base for the unit and all the attachments. The higher models probably have one too, but I don&#x27;t know how useful they are, and this one little quirk certainly wasn&#x27;t worth the added expense to me - so I&#x27;m happy with the one I got.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The -1 star is because of the head. The diameter of the bristles is fine - what really bugs me is the depth of the fat stem. I wish they could&#x27;ve made it a little flatter, or at least recessed that area where the part with the bristles attaches to it. That protrusion totally prevents me from getting the bristles to the chewing area of my back teeth, which really pisses me off, because I like to be thorough. So I end up having to hit those manually with my old Cybersonic head. Bummer. I&#x27;ve had to readjust how I brush my inner bottom fronts too. I have to hold the handle upside-down and almost completely vertical, and hit those from above. I don&#x27;t remember ever having to do that with my Cybersonic. Awkward. But other than that, I&#x27;m pretty happy with my purchase. Especially since I got everything so cheap!iving me nuts, but I found a small bait-and-tackle type case at Daiso for $1.50 that fits everything perfectly (I&#x27;ll try to  post a pic).

            <li> My teeth feel really clean. The brush is noisier than expected.  My last Oral B sonic was quieter.  Had that toothbrush for about 10 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ordered from Amazon.  Great 1 day service!  Have purchased several items via Amazon and have been very happy with results.</li>
            <li> I got this for my 10 year old.  He loves it and brushes 2x a day.  No problem.</li>
            <li> Great brush! Does the job as recommended. I would strongly recommend buying this. Worth the money with cash back offer.</li>
            <li> I did have a problem with the first one I ordered.  The flashing charging light would not stop blinking and the handle &amp; base became very hot but Amazon replaced it and it now works fine.  I am very pleased with the product and Amazon&#x27;s return policy.</li>
            <li> wow.. My teeth feel so clean after each use.  Real easy to use.  This  toothbrush takes up a small area .  I suggest one for each member of the family.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a quality toothbrush that was not too expensive and the Oral-B toothbrush was a perfect match.  It has strong motor with excellent vibration and head movement for a goog thorough cleaning. Plus I was able to process a $20 rebate from Proctor and Gamble so this was a grat deal!</li>
            <li> As with past purchases of Braun Electric Toothbrushes (previous version lasted for 10 years!) this is an excellent product . My dentist recommended this brush due to past history of gingivitis which has not since using it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Downside is the cost of replacement brush heads..but Amazon has good pricing for the replacements</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace a Braun Oral B electric toothbrush I have owned for over ten years--it still works just fine, but I thought I should have another one ready to replace it when it failed, as I assumed it must, eventually.  Both the old and the new products are made in Germany, which explains why the old one still works as well as it did when it was new.  The new one (1000) has a smaller charging station, which I thought would be more convenient for travel.  My only complaint about the new brush is that it signals (by a hesitation pulse) every 30 seconds, instead of just after two minutes--which is what the old brush does.  I prefer the two-minute signal and find it mildly annoying to have to count the 30-second signals instead.  Other than that, I am perfectly happy with it, and thrilled to find something that is still made in Germany.</li>
            <li> I bought this toothbrush because it got good reviews on Amazon. I have been using different electric toothbrushes for years. This one is a little different as the head is smaller than what I am used to. But after a few days, it seems to be a good product. And with the rebate currently being offered, a great deal.</li>
            <li> I was a tad hesitant to purchase an electric toothbrush but my dentist recommended it as a remedy to a gum problem. I researched for days, being completely taken aback by horror stories of gum bleeding and other problems caused by such devices. Eventually, I ordered the Oral-B 1000 as it seemed to offer a good value for the price based on various reviews. So far I have absolutely no complaints. The brushing is very smooth, leaves a nice clean feeling, and I have not experienced any gum bleeding. I&#x27;ve only been using the device for about a month so can&#x27;t report on any long-term effects but so far I have to say I made the right choice.</li>
            <li> Had a sonicare and did not like the brushing action or the cleaning involved with the toothbrush. This oral-b keeps my teeth cleaner, requires minimal maintenance and provides gentle, effective brushing action. Glad i made the switch.</li>
            <li> Excellent product but do not expect to receive your $20 rebate even though you send in all your documentation as required!  I have purchased two of the above Oral-B Professional 1000 Toothbrushes and received two letters stating that I must send original UPC barcodes with the original receipt and application in order to receive the $20 rebate.  How can I resend original barcodes that I already sent?  It seems that the company is unwilling to actually give back the advertised rebate!  My opinion is that they are liars and cheats!</li>
            <li> The only thing I would have liked to have with this would have been a cover for the brush, to keep it cleaner.</li>
            <li> The Oral-B Pro-Healthy CP1000 Rechargeable is a good tooth brush. Well made, comfortable in the hand and provides excellent cleaning. However, I was able to buy this from my local chain drugstore for $15.00 cheaper. Check locally first on this item.</li>
            <li> i got this toothbrush at the recommendation of my dental hygienist.  it has made a big difference in cleaning my teeth.  my first visit back to the dentist after using this toothbrush, my hygienist asked if i had been doing things differently because my teeth and gums looked better than usual.</li>
            <li> We bought it to replace an older model which I wish we still had.  First, the packaging is excessive and wasteful.  The toothbrush is adequate, has a low somewhat unpleasant pitch.  It has an intentional &amp;#34;stutter&amp;#34; for each quadrant change-over and does not turn off automatically.  We will use it until it dies, which may be forever; then get something else.</li>
            <li> A good value if you need only a single unit and solo charger. It comes with a single disposable brush head.</li>
            <li> When our old Oral B couldn&#x27;t hold a charge for a full 2 minute brush anymore, we knew it was time to replace it. This was exceeded our expectations. For less money than we spent 3 years ago on our old one, we got a great toothbrush! The base is small, easy to clean, and the battery stays charged for all three family members to brush our teeth, back to back even! We obviously swap out our brush heads, just to clarify! This toothbrush just seems to have more... vigor to it. It&#x27;s perfect for us!</li>
            <li> For the price it&#x27;s fantastic!!! My teeth always feel great afterwards. The true test will be my next dentist appointment.</li>
            <li> This is a replacement for an Oral-B that finally died after many years of service.  When this one dies mamy years form now I will replace it with another Oral-B</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is easy to use, especially for someone like me who has a smaller jaw. My dentist says my teeth are much cleaner than with the manual toothbrush I was using, with less plaque &amp; tartar. It lasts quite a while on a single charge; we don&#x27;t have an outlet in the bathroom of our 1905 house &amp; I can just charge it in my bedroom &amp; then keep the toothbrush in the bathroom cabinet. It does take approx. 12 hours to charge fully, but it&#x27;s not a problem for me.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a hug difference using the Oral-B as apposed to a regular tooth brush. Mine was a gift and I loved it so much that I bought one for my boyfriend.</li>
            <li> Originally purchased the Oral-B 1000 at a big box retailer as it was on sale at a price lower than Amazon.  This was to replace a Braun unit that my wife and I shared for several years.  I have had the Oral-B for several weeks now and works much better than the prior Braun unit.  This thoroughly cleans my teeth and gum lines without being rough.  I have had a history of bad plaque build up, which is when I started with the Braun, and now is even better with the Oral-B.  The unit has been holding its charge for a week between being used 4 times a day.  So this is great to take for quick business trips as I can take up to a full week without having to take the charging stand along.  The Clean Precision line offers higher end models with more features, but this unit is exactly what I was looking for with features and price.  I was so pleased with the Oral-B 1000 unit, that I decided to buy another for my children to share (of course each with their own brush attachment).  They were previously using battery operated units, but they were losing their punch.  Even my children have commented how the Oral-B is much better than their previous toothbrushes.  Unfortunately the sale at the big box retailer was over, and Amazon had the better deal.  Which is where I purchased the 2nd unit.  Even at Amazon&#x27;s price, the Oral-B is well worth the value.  My dentist will be pleased with my next check up.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with this tooth brush. Would certainly buy it again and recommend it to a friend. It&#x27;s not too noisy, doesn&#x27;t take much space in the bathroom, has a great grip ... 5 stars!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m extremely pleased with this electric toothbrush.  My husband and I each bought one of these brushes and we are very happy with them.</li>
            <li> Unbeatable! The next best thing to going to your dental hygenist daily.  I have been using the same one for 10 years, never needed to buy a new one.  I switch the brush out every 3 months or so.  I can still remember the epic difference between my regular toothbrush and this. a small amount of toothpaste does a great job. do yourself a favor and get one today.</li>
            <li> After using my Oral B electric toothbrush for over 20 years, it finally died. I was able to obtain a replacement very reasonably on Amazon and had a $10 rebate from the company. I don&#x27;t like the new one as well, but my old model is no longer available. This one has no brush cover and is only one speed instead of two. It is designed to brush your teeth in quadrants, which is not the way I brush. It pulses after each quarter of the process and then gives a bigger pulse at the end.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m getting used to it. But why can&#x27;t they save time and money and effort leaving a great product alone?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for about a month.  It&#x27;s awesome.  I was using an earlier model of an Oral-B electric toothbrush that was dying.  But this 1000 is a hundred times better than the earlier model was when it was new.  The motor is not too loud and they&#x27;ve improved the timing mechanism so that it tells you every 30 seconds when to start brushing another area.  I am able to keep my teeth squeaky clean.  I know my dentist will notice the difference.</li>
            <li> I am having no problems with this toothbrush. It is a bit noisy as written in other reviews. This does not bother me. The battery holds a charge very well, so far. I wait a week between charges. No loss of power in a week.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used manual toothbrushes all my life and was never interested in electric toothbrushes, despite me taking good care of my teeth. Recently I got braces and my teeth started getting a yellow tan because it&#x27;s not very easy to get in between the braces. Then I got this bad boy and I&#x27;ve got to say it&#x27;s been the best thing I&#x27;ve done for my mouth! My teeth are very clean now and in a week my teeth have become whiter, and it&#x27;s very easy to clean in between my braces!!!</li>
            <li> Terrific! This was recommended by my periodontist, and it really makes your teeth &amp;#34;dentist clean&amp;#34;.  I change the brush head every three months as recommended. He said if it gets frayed, it does not clean properly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Oral-B toothbrushes for several years and love how they work. The round heads are more maneuverable than the conventionally-shaped heads on the Sonic Care and, for me, do a better job cleaning my teeth. Plus the Oral-B heads are less expensive in general, and tend to go on sale regularly to keep the long-term costs manageable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although I use their top of the line 5000 series at home, I wanted something for travel use that was less bulky. This caught my eye mainly due to price -- after the manufacturer rebate the final cost was less than $25.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m finding it to be just as capable as their far more expensive 5000 series. While it lacks several of the more advanced features (the timer display module and various speeds, such as sensitive, gum massage, etc.) it gets the job done. To be honest, most of the time on my 5000 I just use the regular speed, so there&#x27;s no real loss of functionality with the 1000 model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It supposedly has fewer pulsations per minute than the more expensive models (20,000 per minute versus 40,000 per minute for the 3000 to 5000 series). I can&#x27;t feel a measurable difference. My teeth feel just as clean after using this versus my 5000 model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The overall size of the handle and charger is more compact than the 5000 series making it much easier to pack in a travel case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No bells and whistles like the more expensive Oral B models, but a much better value. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Love the this product! This model has given me the proper cleaning tool and my dental tech is more than pleased.  Thanks</li>
            <li> This is my 3rd OralB toothbrush and the company must be making cutbacks because it no longer comes with those little pegs that you use to put your toothbrush heads on. Now, that&#x27;s not a big deal if you&#x27;re single, but when two of you are using the same handle, then one of you isn&#x27;t going to have any place to put your brush head...but not to fear, for a meer $7.00 (plus $5.15 shipping &amp; handling) you can now BUY the holder!  Woo hoo!</li>
            <li> Upgraded to this electric toothbrush from an older model Oral-B.  This is a great toothbrush.  Rather than just alerting you when it&#x27;s time to stop brushing (after 2 minutes) it alerts you by pulsating once every 30 seconds - so that it&#x27;s time to move &amp;#34;quadrants.&amp;#34;  This takes some getting use to but it actually does help.  The brush head is great that it comes with, and really feels like it does the job.  The footprint of the actual charging station is tiny, so it doesn&#x27;t take up too much room on my bathroom counter.  It holds the charge for about a week, and alerts me when it&#x27;s time to re-charge.  The manual says you can leave the charger plugged in and it won&#x27;t hurt the brush, but I just unplug it for whatever energy savings it gives me.  Overall a great electric toothbrush for a great price.  Only wish that it would have included a replacement head.</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush. I&#x27;ve used Oral-B electric toothbrushes for many years and this is the best one so far. I really like that the battery stays charged for so long. There are numerous features, but it&#x27;s easy to use. The appearance is good, too. The packaging was very good and the instructions are clearly written with good illustrations. I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> The saying \\&quot;you get what you pay for\\&quot; applies. I&#x27;ve used Oral B electric toothbrushes for years. I liked the small footprint of the charger, plus a $20 rebate! How could I lose? This is truly a piece of junk. It rattles, it vibrates like a jack hammer, it even sounds cheap and like it&#x27;s going to fall apart. Yes, I did get my rebate, unlike several people who reviewed this. The worst 2 things, tho, are that water somehow gets in the brush head and, unless you take it off and rinse out the inside, it starts smelling like swamp water. It&#x27;s not just the head that came with the toothbrush. I&#x27;ve replaced the head, and the same thing happens. Pretty gross. I have to take the brush off every couple of days and soak it in Listerine antibiotic mouthwash. So apparently the unit doesn&#x27;t seal to the brush somehow, despite the little o-rings that come with the brush heads. The second thing is that this wonderful small footprint charger get very hot. I&#x27;m very careful to dry the entire toothbrush every time I use it, but within a couple of days, a brown burnt gunk starts forming on the charger surface (the part that the toothbrush sits on) and every day there&#x27;s more until I scrape it off and start over again. I think I&#x27;ll just order another one and try to shame Oral B into a refund. This hot charger and burnt gunk make it hazardous, I think. Next time, I&#x27;ll get the one I usually get. Pay the money and forget the cheap.</li>
            <li> The head stops spinning periodically for a couple seconds during use, feels underpowered.  Bought two and both behave the same way.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m comparing this brush to an older OralB 7000DLX model that it was supposed to replace. The 7000 had a nice smooth vibration and was at the correct vibration speed to allow the brush to get down in between your teeth and their crevasses. This unit has a rougher vibration and, in my opinion, is too fast for proper cleaning. Look elsewhere for a better unit. Since purchasing this unit, I&#x27;ve replaced the battery in my 7000, so this unit is going in the Goodwill pile.</li>
            <li> First, I&#x27;ve only had this for a week but that&#x27;s long enough for me to tell that I&#x27;m like this toothbrush a lot. You know how they recommend that you change your toothbrush every three months or so, well based on the difference between this model and my previous Oral B electric brush, I recommend springing for a new electric brush every couple of years and not just the brush heads.  It&#x27;s a quantum leap forward in speed, feel and handling from my previous Vitality for which I paid around the same price that i was able to buy this 1000 model due to a current sale. This model also has several useful features my previous model didn&#x27;t including shutting down if you are pressing too hard -especially useful for me - and remaining charge indicator.  As is true with most Oral B electric brushes you can use a wide varietiy of brush heads to suit your needs. in all, it would be hard to find a better electric toothbrush at anywhere close to this price.</li>
            <li> Got this for my daughter and have had much better brushing results. Even the dentist made positive statements that the new brush was doing a great job.</li>
            <li> The Oral-B electric toothbrushes very effective and tooth care. The cost of electric toothbrush was very reasonable. I recommend this toothbrush over other brands.</li>
            <li> Powerful spinning action makes teeth feel really clean.  Compact size for the bathroom sink. .  I really love this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> after several days use, my teeth seems whitened a little bit.but one-time charge can not last that long than i thought.</li>
            <li> Very very good toothbrush at a very affordable price. Makes brushing teeth so much more enjoyable compared to conventional brushes.</li>
            <li> We bought these to replace older rechargeable tooth brushes and WOW.  They were used just a few hours after charging them up and mankind, we could feel the cleaning difference over our older rechargeable Vitality brushes.  The price was lower then shopping locally and with the rebate, it was a very easy decision. This Oral-B Professional Healthy Clean Precision 1000 by Braun is an excellent product that we can depend on day after day to attain exemplary oral hygiene care.  We can&#x27;t wait until our next 6 month check-up at the dentist.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend this to friends. Helps keep teeth clean and gums massaged. Easy to use but no need to bear down. I understand from ftriend that they last a long time too.</li>
            <li> Bought this because I brush too hard and have receding gum lines. This works GREAT! Buzzes at every 30 secs so you know when to move to the next quadrent. Stays charged for a long time without being on the charger dock. I bought the sensitive gums head and it works perfectly for my needs! Only complaint is that the head should have a click when attaching to the body. It doesn&#x27;t seem to by a snug fit.</li>
            <li> I must admit  this is the first electric toothbrush i have ever owned, and coming from the usual toothbrush to this ...it is great. It is easy to set up and charge and not as bulky as i first thought so it firsts on my shelf perfectly. It gives a vibration every 30 seconds so you know to move on to the next &amp;#34;quadrant&amp;#34; of teeth. In terms of vibration and noise I find it very quiet, but as i said this is my first electric toothbrush so i have nothing to compare against.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read all the reviews and i thank all those who gave it positive ones, for the more &amp;#34;professional&amp;#34; users i guess there are many things you can nitpick about. My final say is that i would definitely recommend  this to anyone, especially those who have never used one before.</li>
            <li> While this is not the top of the line unit, it does the basics very well.  The 30 second and 2 minute timer pulses are super cool.  Feels like it is doing an excellent job of cleaning as well.</li>
            <li> Replacement for one I have had for 10 years.  Now only single speed vs. dual - but that is fine as I only use it on higher speed.</li>
            <li> Works great.  Lots of power.</li>
            <li> great I use it twice  every day</li>
            <li> My 20 year old unit broke, my fault, so I bought a new one. I should have done it sooner. This oscillates faster, cleans better, and vibrates every 30 seconds to assist in the brushing process.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush we received does not have the brush storage compartment shown in the picture on the website.  It just has a simple oval charge station.  Otherwise it seems fine. I have attached a photo of the actual item. It is replacing an Oral B that lasted for years until it was dropped a second time and refused to turn on.  Hope this one lasts as long.</li>
            <li> I got it for my daughter who is 10. She likes it. I like that it is lighter than other Oral-B power toothbrushes. I thought that it would have the feature to slow the brush down for a more gentle cleaning but this model doesn&#x27;t have it.</li>
            <li> When my [[ASIN:B00BWTWUR4 Dazzlepro Advanced Sonic Toothbrush with UV Base]] gave up the ghost I found that manual brushing was not nearly as effective, so I purchased this model. To be honest, I went by price, and had planned to use this one as an interim solution until I had more time to research and find a better one. This turns out to be all the toothbrush I need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say that I loved the UV base on my older toothbrush, but replacement brushes were nowhere near as easy to come by whereas with this one I can find them in just about any pharmacy, supermarket or big box chain store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, it&#x27;s the thorough and effective cleaning that this model provides. There are no fancy settings, although this one will shut down if you press to hard against your teeth. That&#x27;s a good thing because you really can wear off enamel from hard and frequent brushing. It also has a tactile indicator that lets you know when you switch to another part of your mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line - do not let the low price scare you off. This is half the cost of the one I replaced, and although it does not have the bells and whistles of the older model, it is every bit as effective when it comes to oral hygiene.</li>
            <li> For the money this tooth brush works great! I love the 30 second interval reminders.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband. It took him about four times to get used to it and then he suddenly wondered how he ever lived without this. He is now admitting this new electric toothbrush is doing &amp;#34;a much better job than my old regular toothbrush.&amp;#34; &#x27;Twas a good purchase.</li>
            <li> This is a great brush and it works good and easy.</li>
            <li> I found this toothbrush to be of great value over the Sonicare expensive models. I love the small and simply docking/charging station, and how easily the brush head fits onto the toothbrush. It provides a vibration alert every 30 seconds to rotate the quadrant of your mouth, ensuring you get even brushing. The vibrating and pulsing action massages the gums, and ensures that the bristles get in between your teeth, working to remove plaque buildup. My mouth always feels incredibly clean and fresh after using this, and I feel healthier too!</li>
            <li> Fabulous tooth brush!  Very easy to use, long lasting on a single charge, Oral B Pro does a terrific job!&lt;br /&gt;I have been using an Oral-B tooth brush for almost 10 years.  My previous Oral-B rotating brush lasted for over 9 years, I just replaced it with the updated version at a much better price than I paid 10 years ago.  Highly recommended- my dental checkups are always quick and easy - my dentist told me to keep doing whatever it is that I have been doing.</li>
            <li> Had previous Oral B rechargeable electric toothbrush &amp; this one that I ordered fully met expectations.</li>
            <li> A great product,  very happy with it and would highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product to replace another electric toothbrush I was using that I was unhappy with. This toothbrush does an outstanding job, getting every tooth, even the back ones with great ease. Mouth always feels clean and refreshed and the price was much better than expected. Intend to buy another when needed.</li>
            <li> This product functions as advertised.  After two weeks use, I am very satisfied.  Follow the instructions and brush as directed.&lt;br /&gt;The unit was delivered on time, as promised.</li>
            <li> I bought this after taking a look at several different reviews for several different electric toothbrushes, including the Sonicare version at a comparable price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this for about a month and it&#x27;s been outstanding so far. My dentist had recommended I get an electric toothbrush since my brushing skills apparently suck. I opted for this one since it&#x27;d gotten slightly better reviews than the Sonicare, despite being a couple of bucks higher in price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pros:&lt;br /&gt;Very efficient&lt;br /&gt;Very thorough&lt;br /&gt;Very easy/modern feel to it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cons:&lt;br /&gt;None really (I swear), unless you count its sensor as annoying (the toothbrush stops when you&#x27;re going too hard)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had to go back to my dentist a few weeks after buying this because I had to have a crown procedure done and I asked her: \\&quot;Can you tell the difference?\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She looked at me and her reaction was: \\&quot;Oh my God, you got an electric toothbrush didn&#x27;t you? I can totally see the difference!\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I felt special, ha ha.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This also happens to come back with a rebate (for 50% off) redeemable via mail, which I just mailed in. Not sure if it applies to the Amazon purchase as the rebate says it&#x27;s for a \\&quot;store purchase\\&quot;, but we shall see.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Either way, great toothbrush, I made the right decision.</li>
            <li> This was a replacement for a 10 year old Oral-B. It&#x27;s thinner and the vibrating brush feels faster - gets the job done. The quadrant timers (30 sec) coincide with my brushing habits to begin with but as I get older its nice to know what I&#x27;ve covered :-) Nice to be able to use the same Oral-B brushes that I already had. The charging stand is smaller but right for the brush. All around great brush at a great price.</li>
            <li> I have used the Oral B Electric Toothbrushes for more than a decade. Recently I purchased the Oral B 1000. It is a great purchase. The thing I like about is the feature of giving an indication every 30 secs. That way you can break down the 2mins into 4 quardrants. This helps in going through evenly across. The pulsations are very fast and gives you a squeaky clean. I would highly reccommend this brush.</li>
            <li> good deal for the price. the model 1000 is worth the value compared to the 3000 or 5000.  bought this before for someone else and no complaints.</li>
            <li> I have always used a regular toothbrush and now I am dealing with some gum disease, so, that is where a regular toothbrush got me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I bought this about 5 months ago and I love it for the gums especially. I feel like it stimulates the gums and really cleans inside the pockets.  On top of that, I went back to my Dentist and they didnt have to srap AT ALL(this has never happened before)!&lt;br /&gt; It has a charger, which I like for ease. It also has several heads to choose from. I have also started using a waterjet and I think that helps too.&lt;br /&gt; The two together equal, great oral care. Good luck!</li>
            <li> The last Oral-B unit I owned lasted 8 years.  I expect similar life out of this one too.  The new unit is an improvement over the old, as the manufacturer has upgraded and improved it over the years.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush is quite good and clean my teeth well. It also have a charging indicator so I know when it fully charged. The disadvantage is I don&#x27;t live in US and I need a converter for the plug.</li>
            <li> This product is really what a needed. It is easy to use, even for the whole family and so simple to clean. Thanks to Oral-B!</li>
            <li> Really good product and the toothbrush head is small so it&#x27;s easy to reach areas that regular toothbrushes can not reach</li>
            <li> My Sonicare stopped charging so I did some research and settled on this toothbrush. The Sonicare head was pretty big and I had trouble reaching my back molars. I had to use a kid-sized manual brush to reach them and using two toothbrushes was getting tedious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to give this a try since my dentist recommended them. Well, it cleans well, but it hurt my teeth. I bought a package of Sensitive Heads and that alleviated the issue. I think Oral B should package those with the brush instead of the regular ones. I want to clean my teeth, not strip them of enamel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This also provides a \\&quot;stutter\\&quot; to let you know when to move on to the next quadrant of your mouth. I find it unnecessary and a little annoying. If you&#x27;re brushing properly the stutter is not needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oral B says that there is a \\&quot;brushing too hard\\&quot; indicator, but I can&#x27;t seem to get it to trip. I&#x27;ve tried pressing very hard on my teeth and nothing happens. I just try to remember to grip the brush loosely. It&#x27;s a toothbrush, not an icepick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I get almost two weeks out of a full charge. I unplug the charger when I&#x27;m not actively charging the brush. The directions say you can leave it plugged in, but that&#x27;s what I did with my old Sonicare and the battery wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge for more than 12 hours. The battery technology is different in the Oral B, but I&#x27;m not really one to take chances.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also like that this brush is made in Germany.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m glad I bought this brush instead of another Sonicare.</li>
            <li> Although not the most powerful electric toothbrush I have owned, it is effective and holds a charge for many days. Compact size takes very little space on the counter or storage area which helps.</li>
            <li> This is my second Oral B and I love them. My hygenist noticed immediately the difference using an electric brush. The first one lasted for three years with twice daily use (i was sad that it died, but i&#x27;ve heard that&#x27;s the case with rechargeable batteries). The timer is perfect, gets me to brush longer. Just a side note, be careful not to buy the really rough replacement heads, because the toothbrush is already powerful enough. I wasted money buying the hi-tech &amp;#34;floss action&amp;#34; heads just to find that they&#x27;re way too much with an electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I get this to replace my old Oral-B electric tootbrush that was on-lne for 10 whole years. You can&#x27;t find this quality anywhere else.</li>
            <li> Never thought an electric toothbrush would be worth the investment, but this has made me a convert.  After using this toothbrush my teeth feel super clean compared to using a manual toothbrush.  Even after brushing a lot longer with the manual toothbrush, I cannot get my teeth as clean as with the Oral-B.  I have sensitive teeth and gums and this toothbrush is perfect, it does not irritate them all and my teeth feel squeaky clean.  It is made in Germany, so I expect it to last a lot longer than the cheaply made products from China.  I highly recommend this toothbrush for anyone that wants to have superbly clean teeth in general and for anyone with sensitivity issues.</li>
            <li> Mouth feels cleaner. Teeth look whiter. I like that it lets you know when to change quadrants. I bought one for everyone in our house</li>
            <li> Great electric toothbrush at a reasonable price.  I bought them for my kids for Christmas and it&#x27;s no longer a fight to get them to brush their teeth.  It&#x27;s a fun new &amp;#34;toy&amp;#34; for them.</li>
            <li> Oral B is one of the brands i trust when it comes to teeth care. So, when I found this toothbrush I wanted to give it a chance. You would know that a toothbrush made from Oral-B is high quality.&lt;br /&gt;This new one I have is extremely good. I love how it is aggressive with its cleaning power. I can also adjust the pressure so as to get me comfortable and not get it too rough for my gum and teeth. A great thing about this is that it will tell you that it has low power already because of its blinking mechanism allowing you to charge it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this toothbrush..</li>
            <li> Love it. Light, simple and as described. These extra words are to meet a bothersome requirement for additional blah, blah.</li>
            <li> I prefer the Braun Oral-B electric brush to the Sonicare because of the smaller brush size that gets behind my teeth more effectively.&lt;br /&gt;I used to use the Vitality model, but this one is sleeker, quieter, shows its charge level and - most importantly - has a &amp;#34;quad pacer&amp;#34;. The Vitality has a two minute timer (the proper length of time to brush) but this one alerts you every 30 seconds as well as two minutes - it times each quadrant of your mouth during the two minute brush time so you brush evenly.&lt;br /&gt;It works well, the build quality is excellent.&lt;br /&gt;Braun makes more expensive models but this one has the most needed features at a very reasonable price. It is the one to get if Braun is your thing.</li>
            <li> The battery on my previous one died after many years of good use. It is expensive and also somewhat difficult to replace the battery so I decided to replace the entire unit instead. There was a nice rebate on this and the price was right. I have been using it now for over a month and am completely satisfied. A small signal every 30 seconds reminds you to change quadrants. I would prefer it didn&#x27;t but not a big deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This does not accomodate multiple brush heads so if your intention is multiple users, it&#x27;s not the one you want. I find the single head easier to clean.</li>
            <li> My teeth feel amazingly clean.  The Oral-B 1000 is as easy to use as a manual toothbrush.  The difference:  less work, cleaner teeth.</li>
            <li> Bought this as a gift for my wife and she loves it. She&#x27;s been using it reguarly for about a month now and she says she could never go back to a regular tooth brush, her teeth and gums feel a lot healthier.  Shipper did a great job getting it to us in a timely manner, and it was packaged well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my third braun brush - and I must say they are just getting better and better. Had to use usual brush for three weeks and had  a feeling of &amp;#34;dirty teeth&amp;#34;. But after brushing with this one my teeth feel clean :)</li>
            <li> It works great. The indicator is a plus (it tells you when it&#x27;s almost over, but you can still use for another 2-3 brushes.</li>
            <li> I really liked this toothbrush but it stopped charging after two months :( It seems like most people dont have that problem but if you do you&#x27;re SOL.</li>
            <li> Easy to order without the need to good to a brick and mortar store and wait in long lines at Christmas time.</li>
            <li> Works well. Will stop for a second on occasion when brushing the teeth, but that may be due to adding to much pressure. It does the job and for the price, I would buy one again.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is great!  My teeth always feel dentist-clean when I finish, and the battery lasts for days (I&#x27;ve travelled with it, and it&#x27;s lasted 4 days without a charge).  I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> There is a 2 minute timer to help obtain the best possible cleaning of your teeth.  The battery will last about a week before it needs to be charged.  I looked at the other models but felt this one gives me the features that I need.</li>
            <li> I am impressed with the highspeed action of the unit,  It cleans very well and charges quicklyand is easy to clean</li>
            <li> I like the mechanism that makes you not to press too hard, so it does not damage the gums.&lt;br /&gt;Also the lamp light up as to recharge, adds a lot</li>
            <li> Got it on sale, best ever! Charges fast! Slim charger. Wish it came with one more toothbrush head. Quiet to use</li>
            <li> It works as expected.</li>
            <li> Good mouth care is important to me. I read several reviews on electric toothbrushes and that helped me to decide. I&#x27;m very pleased with this purchase. Thank You czp</li>
            <li> There is a feature listed in the Amazon description that is not on this item: \\&quot;Pressure Sensor stops pulsations when you&#x27;re brushing too hard\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is typical with Amazon. Product descriptions include features not found on the item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, the Oral-B is a very good toothbrush. This is the third one I have owned. I like the single-speed switch of the model 1000 because it is easier to use, and multiple settings are not needed. I paid one-fourth the price others charge. The quality of design and construction seems to keep getting better. This one is quieter, more comfortable, and easier to use than older models.</li>
            <li> I am happy with the job the Oral-B 1000 Electric toothbrush does. It is a good value for the money.</li>
            <li> These fit perfect and seem to clean your teeth better that the old original round heads did.</li>
            <li> Good quality low-cost products.</li>
            <li> I bought this because of a review I read online.  It is simple and effective.  Buy one for your dental health!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend the Oral-B Professional Care 1000 Electric Toothbrush. As usual, Amazon&#x27;s service was exceptional. My teeth have never been good. This toothbrush really does a great job. My first Oral-B was purchased in 2001, a Plaque Remover 3-D. It still works &amp; I still use it. The handle design has not changed much. The 1000 is quieter &amp; vibration is almost non existent. The charging lights which indicate status of charging &amp; low indicator are new &amp; welcome. The charging light blinks while charging &amp; goes out when fully charged. Beware, charging times are LONG. It can easily take 16 hours for a full charge when run down. You can choose to just return it to the plugged in charger after brushing, &amp; thus not worry about charging. It will shut off when peak charge is reached. Without renewed charging, a full charge will last 35-40 minutes. The other improvement is the shorter, 30 second warnings which time your quarterly mouth brushing routine. I like this feature since it does improve your brushing technique with this feedback. The brush pauses are brief &amp; don&#x27;t affect actual brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush heads have been greatly improved over the years. New Precision Clean brush heads are a bit larger &amp; really are tailored to the size of the individual tooth. These heads do a better job creating the \\&quot;bubbles\\&quot; from the toothpaste. I also noticed the massage affects are improved. I really can feel the difference! Four brush heads are available, with different designs &amp; functions. Heads are a bit pricy, but do last a long time, at least for me. Don&#x27;t apply pressure with this brush, it isn&#x27;t necessary. Just touch the brush to your teeth &amp; let the brush do the work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 1000 cleanup is a snap. Just pull the brush head off &amp; wipe the handle with a damp washcloth. The brush heed snaps on easily &amp; remains firm while brushing. I had an earlier Waterpic that had a problem in this area. I personally prefer the smaller, circular brush head of the 1000 to the more traditional linear type of head used by Sonicare. It&#x27;s design to fit each individual tooth enables more flexibility in the style of your brushing, more like a dental instrument. Try it.traditional linear type of head used by Sonicare. It&#x27;s design to fit each individual tooth enables more flexibility in the style of your brushing, more like a dental instrument. Try it.</li>
            <li> Excellent product! ! Had this product years prior and had exellent dental checkups! ! A++++</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for a couple months now.  My Sonicare toothbrushes kept breaking, and are very expensive.  This one does the job at a lower price point and is also recommended by my dentist (in addition to the Sonicare).</li>
            <li> I like the smaller brush head to reach the back teeth.  I had a similar model for several years, and I hope this one will last as well.</li>
            <li> Bought this toothbrush and so far I am very happy with it and both my husband and I use it with different brushes.  I think my next dental cleaning will show an improvement.  Shall see in March.</li>
            <li> Good product. Cleans well and holds a charge. My teeth are clean. What else I supposed to say! Oh, I needed more words. Now I&#x27;m done.</li>
            <li> After using the electric toothbrush for several months, I find that I really like it but it could be better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;*Cleans your teeth and gums really well&lt;br /&gt;*Encourages you to spend more time brushing (2 minutes)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;*It gets really dirty. This is my biggest gripe about it. There is a small hole below the brush that is difficult to clean and I have no idea why it&#x27;s there (the philips electric toothbrush doesn&#x27;t have it.) It&#x27;s where the base connects to the toothbrush and when I take off the top, the metal piece is already getting a little rusty. The base also gets dirty and has to constantly be cleaned.&lt;br /&gt;*It takes a long time to charge and found it lasted me less than a week once fully charged.</li>
            <li> great value and I love the new brush head that cups your teeth for an even better clean. this replaced an oral-b nine years old and i will continue to buy oral-b.</li>
            <li> Well, I bought one of these in Dec 2012, and as of this month, June 2015, it&#x27;s dead, no ability to charge.  Surely a Braun product should be lasting more than 2 and a half years.  It was a one-person toothbrush, so it&#x27;s not as though it got extraordinarily heavy use by multiple users. More to the point, my Braun coffee maker has been going strong for 5 years, which is more than I expected.  Anyway, buyers should know that the toothbrush isn&#x27;t built to Braun&#x27;s former standard.</li>
            <li> Recommended by my dentist for inflamed gums [so embarrassing] and it is far superior to my previous brush.  Using it is very comfortable.  The head of this brush is nice and small and the bristles are soft.  If too much pressure is applied the head stops spinning until pressure is relieved.  My mouth feels much better after two weeks use, and compared to the cost of any dental work this is well worth the money.  I wish I had this a long time ago.  I noticed that replacement heads are available in my grocery store.</li>
            <li> I had an old one of these for about 25 years!  It only just gave up.  This one is more compact and takes less room (the stand) on the sink - I love it.</li>
            <li> Love all Oral-B products.</li>
            <li> Is this the best electric toothbrush ever? No. But it&#x27;s an absolutely *fantastic* toothbrush for the price. This is my second of these - I got it on sale a couple of days ago - and I have to say that it&#x27;s a value even at the regular price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It cleans well and it is itself easy to clean. Really, there isn&#x27;t anything else you&#x27;d need. The more expensive ones have other programs or options, but this cleans as well as any of them. Recommended.</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush!  I have had this model for several years and I am highly impressed.  My dentist always comments how I barely have any plaque since using this product.  I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Great product, has a new head that is just awesome.</li>
            <li> Great clean feeling. Simple to operate as there are no fancy speed settings or modes. Has the 30 sec quadrant timer and the 2 min timer. Also switches off if using too much pressure, although I haven&#x27;t been able to trip it yet into switching off yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oral B brushes are great because the replacement brushes tend to be cheaper than the Sonicare counterparts thereby being cheaper in the long run as well as the initial buy. Generic brush heads also work great with this brush. Do not pay $60+ on this however. Wait for Amazon&#x27;s sale and buy it for around $35-$40. I paid $34 for it.</li>
            <li> Works well for the money spent.</li>
            <li> It is easy to use. My teeth and mouth are so appreciative of the new oral hygiene care they are getting!&lt;br /&gt;Go Oral-B!</li>
            <li> No longer hate brushing and flossing! Do both twice a day. No longer nagged about my dentist for not flossing. This product does both. You have to buy the special flosser separate. I get mine from my dentist.  I&#x27;ve been using it faithfully for three months now. I would gag with a regular toothbrush or spin brush. Now I can get all those hard to reach areas without gagging!  I feel good about brushing again!</li>
            <li> GET IT WHILE IT&#x27;S ON SALE!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;39.99&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had this toothbrush for a couple of weeks.  Really like it.&lt;br /&gt;IT works...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have never had an electric toothbrush before, you need to try out this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It will feel funny at first.  But keep at it.  Soon you won&#x27;t think about it&lt;br /&gt;will be part of your routine and you&#x27;ll feel better too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;****  KEEP SMILING  ****</li>
            <li> I have now bought 6 of these for various members of my family.  We all love the way they work, how they keep their charge, and take up little space on the bathroom vanity.</li>
            <li> Super easy to use.  Definitely an upgrade from the old toothbrush.  Good for sensitive gums as well and the timer is nice.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the older model of this same toothbrush for years and I&#x27;ve always been very happy with this product. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> BUY WHEN CHEAP!!&lt;br /&gt;When I first started looking at the product it was about $39 dollars. Next day it&#x27;s $69. WHAT! So I bought it just in case it went higher and then what do you know a couple days later it&#x27;s $39 again. Amazon, I don&#x27;t appreciate the fluctuation in price so capriciously nor do I like you scamming me out of an extra $30. You should go back to honoring price drops since it pisses off customers like me who frequently makes purchases on Amazon. I hate you for this and will consider not buying from you in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product itself is great, I like that it comes with a small charger so it can be stored easily and it gets the job done. A full charge lasts about 9 days before the light goes red to let you know to charge it. It has 3 brush settings apparently but I have yet to learn how to use them.</li>
            <li> I read a LOT of reviews on electric toothbrushes before going with the Oral B Pro Care 1000 and I am thrilled with my purchase.  I feel like my teeth are much cleaner than they were with a regular toothbrush (as though I had just come from the dentist), it is more kind to my gums and I have adjusted to the feeling of the electric toothbrush as well.  As for other reviews that state they have mechanical problems with electric toothbrushes, if you only spend $40 for this model and get 6-12 months out of it before it breaks, you&#x27;ll be a lot less frustrated than you would if you spent $120.</li>
            <li> I will NEVER use an ordinary toothbrush again.  I feel like I&#x27;ve left the dentist after each brushing.  Trying to convince my husband to purchase one.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described.  I appreciate the timer that alerts the user every thirty seconds so that teeth are thoroughly brushed.</li>
            <li> Christmas gift for my wife. This replaces an older model she had and so far she really likes the performance.</li>
            <li> I saved a lot of money as compared to other retailers like target, and it works great! Came super fast too. No complaints here.</li>
            <li> wanted to have a new brush cause my old one quite on me&lt;br /&gt;Now i have a good one i hope runs for a long time</li>
            <li> Works good but replacement heads so expensive.</li>
            <li> I love the price and how this toothbrush works.  It&#x27;s super easy and it does stay charged for longer than a week.  The charger is tine and it&#x27;s also easy to clean, which is one of the problems that I had with my previous model of Oral-B electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Saves a lot of time and tooth paste. Easy to use and I would recommend to friends.I like it.&lt;br /&gt;thanks</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t be beat!! Replaced one same brand that was at least 15 years old!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Oral-B for years and think it is great.</li>
            <li> A guess it is a Christmas gift and not given yet.  Expect to be happy. with the gift.  I don&#x27;t have anything to say.</li>
            <li> it arrived on time and works well and was a good price. No need to buy a whole kit, this came as a single brush</li>
            <li> Great item, use it everyday and really like it. It cleans good and gets in between the teeth for a through cleaning.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace an electric toothbrush I had for many years that was slowly dying.  It didn&#x27;t seem to be taking or holding a charge.  I figured it was time to replace it.  I was thrilled to find the new one is faster and has more features that I didn&#x27;t know it had.  It still signals the end of 2 minutes but it also signals at the end of every 30 seconds so you can change the section being brushed.  It also vibrates very quickly and you only need to plug the charger in when you are recharging - not all the time as I did with my previous one.  It signals when its time to plug in the charger.  The first time (and only time so far as I&#x27;ve only had it a few weeks) it signals that it was time to recharge I didn&#x27;t realize it meant plug it in immediately so the next time I went to use it, it died while I was brushing.  Now I know to plug it in right away when it signals.</li>
            <li> Does a nice job, but a bit noisy That&#x27;s why I did not give it a 5 star rating. Also charges quickly.</li>
            <li> Been using it for the last year and it works fine!&lt;br /&gt;Heads are not cheap.. you won&#x27;t save any money by using electric brush.</li>
            <li> in my opinion the toothbrush doesn&#x27;t clean teeth thoroughly enough.&lt;br /&gt;I like the idea of toothbrush pulsing after 30 seconds.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is fantastic, spins very fast and really does a great job of removing tarter, couldn&#x27;t beat the price that I got it for on Amazon. I bought this one for my 13 year old, I have had one for 3 years and absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Mouth feels extremely clean afterwards&lt;br /&gt;-Cleans in-between teeth well, the need to floss is lessened due to the pulsating head that breaks up stuck food particles (major plus since I hate flossing)&lt;br /&gt;-2 Minute brush timer, 30 minute quadrant timer (using the cellphone timer was getting old)&lt;br /&gt;-Discreet unit, not too bulky, even the charging station is small&lt;br /&gt;-Brush heads are easily replaced and last a decent amount of time before needing to be replaced&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-Only has a red light to indicate low battery&lt;br /&gt;-A little bit on the noisey side&lt;br /&gt;-Takes a long time to go from a low battery to a full charge (12+ hours)&lt;br /&gt;-No case for traveling&lt;br /&gt;-One speed&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I&#x27;m happy with the product, it met my expectations. This is my first electric tooth brush and likely not my last.</li>
            <li> easy to use and really made the switch from manual to electric toothbrush a total comfort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the only negative point i can think of is when the battery gets weaker, so does the oscillation as well -- probably have to charge it before the red light starts flashing to maintain the intensity of the oscilliation&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;all in all a wonderful addition to my toilet</li>
            <li> Since the more pricey electric tbrushes NEVER SEEM TO GO ON SALE I tend to find the Philips sonicare cleans the most similar. The price point is around 35 dollars, doesnt take 2 days to reach a full charge, so in other words dont waste ur time, or fall victim to their misleading visual marketing.</li>
            <li> I bought the Oral-B Professional to replace an earlier model and it works great. I especially like the feature where it has a special pulse every 30 sec so you know when to move to a different section of your mouth.</li>
            <li> Had been looking for a good electric toothbrush and found this one on here. It had very good reviews and I am glad I purchased it! It has the quadrant timer and if you brush too hard it stops to let you know. Very good brush and my teeth feel even cleaner than when I used a manual brush.</li>
            <li> This was just what I needed thank you very much it worked just great for me I will recommened it to everyone I know.</li>
            <li> It is very loud and harsh on the teeth.  I liked my old Sonic Vitality better.  It worked great but had no replacement s for it.</li>
            <li> Our family has purchased several of these.  Does a great job of cleaning teeth and is reliable.  Worth the money.</li>
            <li> I love the compact brush head and the cleaning an automatic brush provides.  This one was recommended by my dentist.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this toothbrush for about one month, but I don&#x27;t think I could ever go back to another toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I have used this for a month now, and am very happy so far! Like how discreet the charger is.</li>
            <li> Best toothbrush I every tried great cleaning even thought it only has a small head has a lot of power in it as well leaves mouth felling clean and refreshed. I would recamend it to others</li>
            <li> Ask any dentist, these things are better than toothbrushes...who knew?  Very powerful brushing action, prompts you to switch quadrant, has wear indicators, not expensive.  What&#x27;s not to like?</li>
            <li> I love this product.  Works great and well worth the money.  I bought one for me and ended up buying additional ones for my kids.</li>
            <li> Perfectly OK.  Just not very good.  I gather the battery power on these things is not great but it can&#x27;t be a lot worse than this one...it needs a long recharging once a week, at least.  The action on the head is weak, too--I know you&#x27;re not supposed to press down with toothbrushes but the motor just about stops with the least rotation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Spend a little more and get a little more.  I just ordered the 3000 and consider the 1000 a not-too-expensive lesson/introduction to the world of electric toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> It gets my teeth cleaner than any other tooth brush I have ever used. I haven&#x27;t had any issues with it and am impressed with the battery life.</li>
            <li> I feel super clean after using this toothbrush. Fits nicely in my hands! Easily stays charged for brushing. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I bought this solely because it \\&quot;had\\&quot; a pressure sensor (my dental hygienist said I should have this feature).  I tried testing it on my hand and the only thing I noticed was that if I pressed hard enough to bore a hole in wood, the motor bogged down.  I really do hope this wasn&#x27;t it!  Despite what the box says, there is NO pressure sensor.  I don&#x27;t like being taken, so I&#x27;m pretty harsh with the rating.</li>
            <li> I loved this toothbrush when I first got it but it stopped working after 6 months.  I feel it should have lasted at least a year.  I am very disappointed and would not recommend this toothbrush.  I will look for another brand.</li>
            <li> Brushing with an electric toothbrush is like getting a cleaning at the dentist.  I wouldn&#x27;t want to go back to a manual brush. All my grandchildren now have access to an electric toothbrush. I also bought the model that has the attached holder for extra heads so everyone could use the electric brush. This is the only model I&#x27;ve used, but I&#x27;m glad it&#x27;s the one I bought.</li>
            <li> I had this since Christmas. It works better than a regular toothbrush.  The only problem is every time you are done brushing you have to pull up the brush and shake out the toothpaste. If you don&#x27;t the base will have toothpaste and water all over it. It takes another minutes or so but it&#x27;s worth it. Overall decent product.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with this toothbrush.  Very nice and cleans well.  Was a great buy and a great price.</li>
            <li> Really cleans and tells you when to advance to another section of your teeth.</li>
            <li> Even the dental hygienist and dentist stand by this electric toothbrush.  I&#x27;ve recommended it to family and friends.  BE prepared for improved six month checks.</li>
            <li> Its ok, I haven&#x27;t used it much since i switched back to manual brushing! I guess its just OK. .</li>
            <li> Its really worth a try !!! I Absolutely Love it so far!! I never tried anything like this before !!!</li>
            <li> This is my first electric toothbrush. I can&#x27;t believe I waited so long to switch. Teeth feel like they do after a cleaning at the dentist.</li>
            <li> I have been using this a little over a year.  I like the small head.  Makes it easier to maneuver around teeth.  Recently bought the extra soft heads.  They seem to work as well as the standard head.</li>
            <li> This is the second unit for me,without any hesitation I bought for second time.Also, the brand of Oral-B is well known ,this design is simple and do the requirement.</li>
            <li> My wife likes the smaller head which makes it easier to get her back teeth. In her opion this model has everthing she needs and it was a great price.</li>
            <li> My first electric brush, good price, only one concern, after about 2 minutes it sounds as if it is going to stop but then keeps on trucking. Not sure why, but this seems to,occur each and every use.</li>
            <li> Takes a while to charge it the first time. After that I only charge it about once every 2 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;Does a great job of cleaning my teeth. would recommend anyone to purchase this one.</li>
            <li> Nicely packaged.  Bought it as a gift so no idea how it works or functions.  Recipiant seemed pleased when it was opened.</li>
            <li> I been looking for an electric toothbrush for a while. I got a giftcard for christmas and bought this product and I love it. I have noticed it does stop occasionally (maybe I am pressing too hard but I don&#x27;t think so and it sits on the charger all day) Either way awesome price and very happy with this purchase!</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful, powerful product, far superior to its step-down version. Spend the extra money; your mouth will thank you. If I was a genie, I would cause the recharge process to be faster. It takes many many hours, but, oh well...</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush. Has a timer, which forces you to brush for 2 minutes (GOOD THING!). Well, you CAN stop sooner, but then face your guilt!  Much cheaper than the higher models, and I think it works great. Recommend!</li>
            <li> I have had one like this for a few years now and got a new one for my husband.  When I go to the dentist, I&#x27;m always told what good clean teeth I have.  I guess the electric toothbrush gets some credit for it.</li>
            <li> Toothbrushes from oral B has given the market top notch products over the past years. This new electrical toothbrush really is heaven sent. I have always used oral B dental hygiene products. This electric toothbrush just made it to my necessity. The buy was totally worth it.&lt;br /&gt;It gave me the needed cleanse and care that my sensitive teeth deserves. Aside from the quality that it bestows, the rechargeable battery with light on the switch that would light up whenever you&#x27;ll need recharging is a great addition to the amenities of the toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;You can also navigate the speed of the brush. For me, I prefer the slow speed because my buccal mucusa and gums are extremely sensitive.</li>
            <li> It was time to switch from a regular toothbrush to an electric.  I am very pleased with the Oral-B Professional Care 1000; meets all my expectations.  Thanks.</li>
            <li> Small footprint and excellent cleaning. I couldn&#x27;t ask for more.</li>
            <li> Pros: Works great and I like it even better than my Sonicare brush. It is easy to handle and takes up less counter space.&lt;br /&gt;Cons: I would like a brush head cover. The buzzing sound is highly reminiscent of a dentist&#x27;s drill and took some getting used to.</li>
            <li> This electric toothbrush is fine, except for the fact that the button to turn it on is very hard to push.  I purchased this for my mother in law and she was unable to turn it on at all.</li>
            <li> Love It. This Oral-B electric toothbrush is awesome. It works so much better than my 20-year-old Braun electric toothbrush. It&#x27;s much more powerful and I like the pulses the Oral-B does at 30-second intervals. My teeth feel so much cleaner just like I came from the dentist. All I need now is to get get some Crest 3-D white to help brighten up my dingy teeth. I turned around and ordered this toothbrush for my husband (shhhh - he doesn&#x27;t know yet as it&#x27;s a surprise).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great. I have been using it for about 18 months now. No problems.</li>
            <li> My old Oral-B toothbrush died after 7 years, so I decided to go with this one.  It works just as well as my old brush and was 1/3 the price!</li>
            <li> I love it and a great clean feel</li>
            <li> Great deal and excellent service</li>
            <li> 8 months after purchase the battery charge lasts through only 2 minutes of brushing.</li>
            <li> Works great! Has a lot of power, might switch to the sensitive heads as I have sensitive gums</li>
            <li> Described well. Like that Amazon had many to choose from. When you look in the stores, they often will only have one Oral B model available. Like that I could buy this one. Relatively inexpensive but a good quality product that does the job well. My last Oral B lasted about 10 years.</li>
            <li> This is a really good buy. It brushes well, takes the various head options and uses the four thirty second stutters to time your brushing. It Brushes at only one speed and does not have the fancy modes for tooth whitening or scrubbing braces, which I do not need. The charging apparatus is all standard. Buy this brush if you want standard Oral B quality at about 1/3 the price. I am very happy with it, replacing a ten- year old one hat finally died.</li>
            <li> Its high speed cleaning does the trick.  It times you with hesitations to encourage you to move the spinning head to other places in your mouth to get a thorough polishing.</li>
            <li> Replaced one my wife had for years and met all of her expectations.</li>
            <li> Have always had good luck with Oral-B.  Never sure one better than the other, but like the action of this unit.  Miss the holder for multiple brushes I had with my previous unit, otherwise happy with purchase.  Seemed like good value.</li>
            <li> it is simply the travel charger that I already have if I had known that I would not have purchsed this item.  It is not the complete Oral B package that one purchases</li>
            <li> My daughter, now back in school for another degree, loves this electric toothbrush.  Her old one (Sonicare) died, and we decided to try an Oral-B.  She said it&#x27;s perfect, plus the price for me was great!  Would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> I never had an electric toothbrush before.  The replacement brushes last a long time and good quality.  My dentist appointments are much shorter, I have a lot less plaque.</li>
            <li> Bought this to replace a similar electric toothbrush which died after probably over 10 years of use.  Works great, just what I needed.  Only one minor thing I don&#x27;t like is the &#x27;reminder&#x27; pauses after every 30 seconds of brushing - I mean who cares about that?  All that is really needed is the final &#x27;reminder&#x27; pause at the end of 2 minutes.  Overall, very happy with purchase.</li>
            <li> Great Oral-B toothbrush, great price, works great. It has a nice small charger. It is also great for travel due to it&#x27;s size.</li>
            <li> This is my third Oral -B rechargable Tooth Brush. I buy it because it works. I&#x27;m sure I buy another when the time comes. It&#x27;s a good product for a reasonable price. Thanks.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;re first time electronic toothbrush users and these are a great buy! My husband and I use them everyday. We charge them fully and use until the battery lights come on and they last a long time. Would recommend them for anyone!</li>
            <li> Great price for this brush.  Working fine and exhibits a lot of power for the cost.  Great replacement brush at economical price.</li>
            <li> Was looking for a toothbrush to clean the back of my rear teeth.&lt;br /&gt;The round rotating brush head is exactly what I was looking for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A great plus is the 30 second indicator.&lt;br /&gt;At the end of 30 seconds, the toothbrush will pulse on/off to let you know to move to another quadrant of your mouth.&lt;br /&gt;In 2 minutes, (30+30+30+30) and your done brushing your teeth!</li>
            <li> So far so good.  I replaced an older more expensive model but this one seems to be as effective and I like the charge battery indicator.</li>
            <li> I got this toothbrush for my kids.  They really are brushing!  Our dentist says there teeth look great and not nearly as much plaque.</li>
            <li> It does it&#x27;s job beautifully!</li>
            <li> ARRIVED WITHOUT ADAPTOR TO AUSTRALIAN POWER POINTS. DISAPPOINTING!</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush. Recommend by dentist</li>
            <li> My teeth don&#x27;t feel clean compared to using a regular brush plus it bothers my sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li> Was bought as a gift person loves it</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is such a wonderful investment.  It brushes so well and is so convenient.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush is great. feels right and does a good job.  I don&#x27;t find the sixty second alerts useful but they don&#x27;t interfere with the brushing.  My problem is that the small base makes the unit top heavy and likely to tip when I&#x27;m reaching for something else near it. A slight nuisance.</li>
            <li> This brush is a bit of a different experience for me, having used a much less expensive electronic brush system before. The brushing action is different but very effective and my teeth feel even cleaner than before.  It took quite a while, more than 12 hours for the battery to fully charge and takes a good while for it to fully recharge to capacity after each use. But this is not at all a problem because it holds it&#x27;s charge forever- literally. :-)  Update: I have updated my rating to 5 stars after using this brush for the better part of a year. Using the smaller round brush head this toothbrush has helped me get my teeth cleaner than ever before. The smaller head is especially useful for brushing behind the back teeth even if you still have your wisdom teeth in place, as I do.</li>
            <li> One of the best features is that it lets you know every 30 seconds so you can change area of brushing.  It also lets you know when the 2 minutes is up.  It is an excellent toothbrush and power brushes are better than self brushing.</li>
            <li> Works great!  What a difference it makes!</li>
            <li> Had one before and will buy again- very nice quality.</li>
            <li> Charged quickly. Easy to take from package to setup in the bathroom. I really like how the toothbrush works for me. The brush is just right (a little stiff) and my mouth feels clean, once finished.</li>
            <li> Great product for a great price. My teeth feel sooo clean after using this toothbrush. Definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe this is such a popular product. It feels like its going to shake my teeth right out of my mouth because it&#x27;s so strong and I can&#x27;t imagine that the turning of the brush is good for your gums? It&#x27;s painful and should come with a speed/sensitivity option to at least give their customers a choice and a chance to be able to use it.</li>
            <li> I find this toothbrush to be great. It is my first electric toothbrush so I didn&#x27;t want to invest in one with all the bells and whistles. This one does all i need an electric toothbrush to do. It is gentle on the teeth and gums. I have been having less tartar build up since using it. It was a good choice for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very impressed with this Precision 1000.  Leaves my teeth feeling nice and clean.  The only thing I feel is a bit redundant is the timer or the &amp;#34;hesitation&amp;#34; to tell you to move to another quadrant.  I brush 3 to 4 times longer than the timer cycles.</li>
            <li> Excellent cleaning power. Does everything I wanted it to do. Signals you when suggested time elapses. Don&#x27;t use generic replacement brushes. Stick with the Oral B brand.</li>
            <li> I purchased this toothbrush for my wife as a replacement.  It is as good or better than her prior, much more expensive rechargeable toothbrush.  She is not pleased with the 30 second notifications.  Her prior tooth brush provided a notification every 2 minutes which she prefered.</li>
            <li> These are way better than the older model that I had. It has worked well for about 3 months now. Love them!</li>
            <li> I love this thing! It is made in Germany and is very high quality, not like the cheap crap you get from China. It works perfectly and my teeth feel very clean. Much better than a manual toothbrush. Seems to get between the teeth better. Buy it, you wont be disappointed. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> This is fantastic and great.  I love mine and do trust Oral B.  I got my daughter and her husband two for Christmas!</li>
            <li> My first electric toothbrush. Looks great. Nice package. Works as I thought.&lt;br /&gt;  Seems can not set the brush model. ( not as the instruction said)</li>
            <li> This is a great electric toothbrush.  My teeth have been noticeably cleaner (I was using a normal toothbrush before).  It is very user friendly, and doesn&#x27;t have unnecessary add-ons.  I like that there are multiple options for toothbrush heads.  I haven&#x27;t had any problems at all with this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Very good quality.  My dentist recommended it!!  Very satisfied. Like the newer features, quadrant alert brushing. Oral-B is a very good brand.</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush, I cannot use a normal brush anymore after switching to this one.  The clean feeling doesn&#x27;t even compare.  The brush heads last a long time as long as you rinse them off and store them so they dry out.  I&#x27;ve had the brush about two years or so.&lt;br /&gt;The one gripe I have with it is the battery, mine doesn&#x27;t hold a charge anymore so I&#x27;m going to replace it.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased the Oral-B Professional Care 1000 and I love it. Battery lasts for almost a week. It works perfectly and it&#x27; s easy to use. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> The best electrical toothbrush I ever had. Easy to clean and small on the counter. The timer is good too.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend has been using this toothbrush for more than a year now and loves it! So, I bought one and love it better than my other electric toothbrush. It&#x27;s not as loud as the one I tossed in the garbage, and it feels like it&#x27;s cleaning my teeth.</li>
            <li> Amazon description says &amp;#34; Pack contents included are 1 handle, 1 charger, 1 ProWhite refill brush head, 1 refill stand, and 1 travel case vs. a regular manual toothbrush.&amp;#34;. This is false.  There is no refill stand or travel case.  I have received 2 and they are both just a brush and charger.  Brush itself is a good product, thus the 2 stars.</li>
            <li> This is a replacement for ours that broke(not due to manufacture default but 11 and 7 yr old boys dropping it repeatedly). I ordered it Dec 23 and it arrived Dec 28!!!</li>
            <li> The only drawback I see that there is no cover for its head or no case to put this awesome toothbrush in. Othere than this it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;pressure alert&amp;#34; or whatever they call it isn&#x27;t actually a feature. The motor just gets bent a little when you push really hard so it changes tone. That&#x27;s what they&#x27;re advertising. Either way it works really well and the base charges by inductance which is not only cool (albeit slow), but it makes the thing really easy to clean.</li>
            <li> I have had this toothbrush for a couple of years, so we recently bought another one for my husband. Works well to clean teeth. Toothbrush lasts a few days of brushing in between charging.</li>
            <li> really cleans well, would highly recommend. this is my first electric toothbrush and i am impressed with how well it cleans.</li>
            <li> When our old Oral-B toothbrush wore out after 10+ years, my husband and I realized Oral-B was the brand for us. The Healthy Clean Precision 1000 toothbrush does a fine job of cleaning our teeth - you can ask our dentists! The standard 2 minute timer is broken into four 30 second quadrant units, which really breaks up the monotony of swirling a toothbrush through your mouth at random for 120 seconds. Each quadrant gets the attention it deserves! This toothbrush needs to be charged only once every 2 or 3 weeks and has a courtesy reminder light that indicates weak power. Our teeth and gums love this toothbrush!</li>
            <li> I love using this toothbrush.  I feel like I&#x27;ve just been to the dentist&#x27;s office after every time I use it.</li>
            <li> I was planning on saving some money by switching to oral-b from sonic care because the replacement heads are cheaper, but I ended up wasting 40 bucks. This toothbrush feels like a jackhammer rattling my skull but somehow it doesn&#x27;t manage to clean my teeth. After brushing I can still feel a layer of plaque on my teeth and I have to brush it off with a normal brush. I have been using the oral-b for a week hoping that it would improve but it hasn&#x27;t. I will spend the extra money and go back to sonic care.</li>
            <li> After reading multiple reviews on all the many electric toothbrushes out there, I chose this one for my husband and me. I&#x27;m happy to say that we love it! You really get that just-been-to-the-dentist feeling. Some reviewers did not care for the two minute signal the toothbrush emits, but neither one of us minds it at all. It does help us stay focused on brushing each quadrant. Amazon offered a much better price than a large retailer, too. Good value!</li>
            <li> Works well!  My hygienist has noticed improvement and my measurements have definitely improved.  Would not go back to the sonicare.</li>
            <li> This is a really powerful toothbrush!&lt;br /&gt;Despite having a couple of front facing fillings (the dentist called them buckles) reveal them selves to be defective once I started using this toothbrush (they got knocked off, thannnnnks old dentist, grrr) I am still very pleased with this brush.&lt;br /&gt;I admit after the bad buckle debacle I chatted with my dentist (new and improved, dentist 2.0!) to just confirm it should be okay to use a brush like this on teeth with fillings and buckles etc and she said YES In fact she highly recommended it.&lt;br /&gt;I have found my teeth to feel reallllllly clean after using this brush, that super smooth and slick just had them professionally cleaned feeling.&lt;br /&gt;The small head and the power means I am doing a better job of cleaning behind my back teeth which despite my most gung ho efforts has always been a &amp;#34;do better job&amp;#34; spot for me personally.&lt;br /&gt;I find this brush to be a much better design than an older electric brush we had years back. This one seems easy to keep clean and hygenic. We pop the brush heads off and keep them in a little container next to the brush where it sits on it&#x27;s charger base. We pop the head off after every use and dry the end with a towel just to make sure we keep things clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the timer feature.&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s a big difference in thinking you&#x27;ve done the proper amount of brushing time and ACTUALLY doing the right amount of brushing time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like I said above, it&#x27;s verrry powerful. It&#x27;s not like the old school electrics that were weak and barely wiggled this is very aggressive.&lt;br /&gt;If you have sore gums or something you might want to use caution and investigate whether this is the right brush for you.&lt;br /&gt;After I had my buckles fixed my gums were sore from the work and the needles and I had to stop using this brush until they healed. My manual brush felt insignificant in comparison, was happy to get back to using this brush.</li>
            <li> No complaints, price was good, it&#x27;s quieter than a previous Oral B brush I had and I like the low profile base which we only use when the battery shows low. I keep the charger plugged in in a cabinet out of sight.&lt;br /&gt;I like the red light low battery indicator - my kids notice and put it on the base when it&#x27;s out (my three kids and I each have our own heads and share the handle).&lt;br /&gt;Now I&#x27;m looking for a good cheap head holder.</li>
            <li> I have really bad overcrowding, so even though I brushed my teeth like I was supposed to, I still got really bad gingivitis and cavities because my standard toothbrush was unable to reach certain places, and I also brushed way too hard.My dental hygienist suggested I get this and I love it! My gums look great, my teeth always feel like I just came from the dentist, it stops when you brush too hard, and it gets in every single place! I went to my orthodontist for the first time after two months of owning this and he said I had super healthy gums and teeth!</li>
            <li> use every day.... recommend.</li>
            <li> better than the vibrating one</li>
            <li> 10 years ago the basic model came with a 2 nub brush holder.  This one doesn&#x27;t.  Did Braun get feedback that indicated to them that having a place to actually store the brush heads was inconvenient to customers?  The bases can be purchased - for ten bucks plus shipping.  Really?</li>
            <li> Almost cheaper to buy a new unit than to buy a pack of brush replacements</li>
            <li> I am a little concerned about the toothbrush as it makes a funny noise with the motor.  But I am very happy otherwise.</li>
            <li> Not bad overall, but I would spend some extra $ and get the 5000 model.  Well worth it.  This definitely does a great job of cleaning but the biggest setback is the base grows mold fairly quickly and gets pretty gross.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used mine for 3 years now and it still works fine.  Only the battery power has declined over time.</li>
            <li> awesome toothbrush, makes it fun haha</li>
            <li> Does a good job and is easily cleaned.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my husband and so far he says he loves it. If something comes up in the future, I&#x27;ll be sure to update my review. Until then, two thumbs up!</li>
            <li> quit working in about 6 months</li>
            <li> Previous to this I had an Oral B electric toothbrush for 15 years. It wasn&#x27;t till recently that it started to malfunction and&lt;br /&gt;I had to buy a new one. This new toothbrush , I must say, is not as good as that toothbrush. This toothbrush has&lt;br /&gt;Only 1 speed and is a bit difficult to shut off.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like this model and should have purchased one of the models that allows you to change vibration speed. I have a lot of teeth that have crowns on them and I feel like the vibrations will loosen them up. It&#x27;s way too strong. My teeth feel clean but I only use it every other day. It rattles my brain!😕</li>
            <li> Good product.  reliable.  Well price</li>
            <li> I love this brush. It has replaced my traditional brush. I like the timer that reminds me when to move to another quadrant of my mouth. It doesn&#x27;t irritate my gums and feels really good. The charging base is really nice too. It&#x27;s a great quality product, AND... it&#x27;s made in Germany!&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that it take HOURS to charge. I don&#x27;t mean a few hours, I mean it takes almost a whole day to fully charge when it&#x27;s nearly completely drained.</li>
            <li> Lightweight and power button responsive to moderate pressure.</li>
            <li> So much better than the other brand.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned three different Oral-B electric toothbrushes.&lt;br /&gt;The 1st was great, but was powered by two AA batteries, and I felt bad going through so many of them over time.&lt;br /&gt;I eventually upgraded to my 2nd Oral-B electric toothbrush - with a rechargeable battery, yay! - but it had an LED screen in the handle which was kind of unnecessary, caused it to be bulky, and I think it also ate up power.&lt;br /&gt;So, after using that one for a few years, I finally upgraded to my 3rd Oral-B - this one, the PRO 1000 - which is just right!  No unnecessary extras which I&#x27;ll never use, and which drain power.  An easy-to-hold handle.  An easy recharger, which gives me a week&#x27;s worth of brushing. (!) And as if all that weren&#x27;t enough?  This toothbrush is one of the most inexpensive ones!&lt;br /&gt;Needless to say… it&#x27;s already my favorite Oral-B.</li>
            <li> Still using this toothbrush til this day, bought it many years ago, works and functions great, kind of annoying now to brush my teeth using a regular manual toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I wish I would have bought this product much, much earlier.  Excellent experience, buying, delivery and use.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush works great! I bought it because it&#x27;s a great price for an electric toothbrush ($50 compared to over $100) and it works quite well! It doesn&#x27;t blow me away but it does its job and I&#x27;ve noticed my teeth looking nicer than before. I&#x27;m happy with this product for the price.</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush but I am very disappointed that I bought it in June of 2015 and it has already broke.  The brush won&#x27;t spin anymore.  I thought getting it here cheaper than at a store was a good deal but obviously it backfired.</li>
            <li> I bought a Braun Oral B about 10 years ago for about $100. I used it twice a day exclusively, and it only just broke down last week. I looked online for a replacement, and decided to go for this earlier model because my husband has a newer and fancier model (with a timer, battery indicator, etc), but it doesn&#x27;t really feel very different. All I cared was that this brush was made in Germany, and price is hard to beat. The brush came in two days and runs and feels absolutely great. I hope it will last for ten years, too. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Handle is slippery when your hand is covered with water/toothpaste foam.  They should have designed ribs or rubber overmold on the handle.  I dropped it a few times already.</li>
            <li> There is a mail in rebate form attached so the product will be 29.99 not 49.99.  I couldn&#x27;t open the form before I purchased but went ahead and purchased 3 as that is all it would let me purchase.  Well after receiving the product I tried to open the rebate form again and it states that I can claim only one of the three items purchased.  This is false advertisement and should at least state only 1 item per rebate in the details of the cost!!!!</li>
            <li> Considering i went to go buy this brush at K-mart and found out it was double the price compared to Amazon it was a no brainer really. Delivery was quick and i enjoy brushing my teeth again. It has no speed settings or anything but it still gets the job done, highly recommended!</li>
            <li> this brush is a strong little machine! i can feel a huge difference vs a regular toothbrush, much better then the battery operated oral b basic model for $ 7.99 in most drugstores. this brush is a definite investment. it does all of the work! i just have to guide it. really deep cleaning.</li>
            <li> Like this toothbrush just fine except - the on/off button is hard to locate while you&#x27;ve got the toothbrush in your mouth. I nearly always have to take it out while it&#x27;s still running to locate the button. Not major - just an annoyance.</li>
            <li> Bought this as a replacement after my Braun 3D died. My old Braun toothbrush heads fit on this and works just fine, and the main brush handle also fits the old charger and charges also. This brush is about 50% quieter than the old one, and spins faster.</li>
            <li> Powerful little toothbrush, light, easy to hold, and really does a good job. Price was good and I may buy some more for my grandkids.</li>
            <li> Finally got in for the super-duper cleaning I had been putting off for a year and it wasn&#x27;t so bad at all. I found a new dentist and discovered that their office was basically a &amp;#34;tooth spa&amp;#34; ... Or at least they were attempting to craft the illusion (&amp;#34;Lavender neck pillow, sir?&amp;#34; &amp;#34;Glass of water from the freshwater springs of the midi-Pyrenees?&amp;#34; &amp;#34;Would you let to pet one of our Relaxation Rabbits?&amp;#34;).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyhow, a few novacaine injections, a wisdom tooth extraction, and a couple hundred bucks later, good folks at the Tooth Spa sent me home drooling like a disoriented monkey and with explicit instructions to purchase one of this gizmos. Seeing as I am now really &amp;#34;into&amp;#34; obsessive brushing and compulsive flossing, this little number is a godsend. Price is great, it has a lot of power to blast those unsightly bits of animal tendon and pesky escargot tails from betwixt your newly polished fangs. Werewolves might require something of more industrial strength, but this is a MUST for those humans who really don&#x27;t want their teeth to slowly rot right out of their very heads in a gruesome, yellowing spiral of abject decay. Highly recommended. Nothing like a squeaky clean mouth.</li>
            <li> No problems yet and plenty of rebates &amp; coupons to get you started.  This toothbrush definitely gets my teeth cleaner than manual brushing.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace my 12 year old Oral-B tooth brush and it is better than the old one, I will never buy a different brand.</li>
            <li> This is my first electric toothbrush and it is fantastic. I have used this for about 2 months now. My teeth feel super smooth afterwards. I charge it about once a week and no issues with the battery life. I recommend buying it.</li>
            <li> much more thorough than a manual tooth brush.  Able to notice a difference right away and continues to get better over time.</li>
            <li> Use this tooth brush and you will never go back to a manual tooth brush. It makes your teeth feel so clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> I usually used the Spinbrush from oral b but it was finally wearing out, so I decided to give this one try based on the reviews. I think it does a decent job. I don&#x27;t usually have problems with my teeth or gums and dentist has always said my teeth were in very good shape. I have been using this for about a week and it works just as well. The 30 sec timer on it for each area of mouth (4 quadrants 30 sec each) is somewhat noticeable, but not much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t go by the 3 month rule. My other brush (oral b spinbrush)  had the same rule about changing heads, but I let mine go for almost 6 months and never had a problem with it wearing down or teeth and gums not getting cleaned, so I am hoping this will last as long. I think the 3 month thing is just more of a way to get people to buy brush heads more often then they need to make more money.  So only buy when you feel it is necessary (teeth and gums not getting as clean as they should) or you really notice the brush heads wearing out.</li>
            <li> OMG! The other reviewer was right: this thing is like a jack-hammer. My gums are still buzzing a half-hour later. I&#x27;ve owned a lot of electric toothbrushes and this one is dangerous. I had to count my teeth after using it. Get something else. You could not possibly do worse.</li>
            <li> This is the first electric toothbrush that I have ever used. I really like it. I like how it alerts you every 30 seconds to ensure an even brushing time all over.</li>
            <li> nice product.&lt;br /&gt;would definitely recommend this to a friend. holds its charge &amp; doesn&#x27;t take up much space in cabinet.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied and highly recommend.  Item was shipped fast and takes brushing to the next level. I will never use a regular brush again. A++++</li>
            <li> got what I wanted, when they said. can&#x27;t ask for more then that. solid job all around. no complaints at all.</li>
            <li> It does what it claims to do: help you brush your teeth.  Decent build quality so far.  Made in Germany, not Chicom.  If it lasts as long as my last Oral/Braun, great.  If not, not.</li>
            <li> I bought another Oral B toothbrush because the previous one worked well for a few years and mostly because I had recently paid their outrageous price to get a packet of replacement brushes and thus had to buy the same brand to get a handle to which they would attach.  This machine runs at a higher speed than the previous model, which attribute I don&#x27;t really understand.  The machine stops if it hits a little friction in my mouth (they previous one never did that).  Minor points, I suppose.  The major drawback is that there is a blinking green light that lights a darkened bathroom very well for about 15 minutes after using the machine and placing it on the charger.  So, if i brush my teeth before going to bed, the annoying green light in the adjoining bathroom flashes on and off onto my bedroom wall until the mechanism is fully charged again.  Is it necessary to be told the machine is charging?  The older model just showed a dim, steady light to indicate it was working properly.  Yes, I could close the bathroom door, but it aids air flow to keep it open.  I am going to run a band of electrician&#x27;s tape around the handle to cover the light.  But why should I have to do that?</li>
            <li> I have been using Oral B Electric toothbrushes for many years and from the first loved it. I have a very small mouth, as my dentist will attest, and most of them are too large and my teeth do not get cleaned as well. I also love that it is timed for two minutes which is the length of time we need to clean our teeth. Overall I would not use another toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I like that the charger takes up so little space on the bathroom counter, but re-charging time is kind of long. The brush slows if any pressure is put on it, so there&#x27;s a learning curve.  I think it does a good job of cleaning . . I hope for confirmation of this at my next dentist appointment.</li>
            <li> This is the best electric toothbrush ever!  Not only is it powerful, it is gentle.  It really does a great job in 2 minutes.  Gives you a signal every 30 seconds and then a longer signal at 2 minutes.  It&#x27;s a weird signal as I was expecting a beep but it is just a gentle change in the speed of the brushing.  I am very pleased and have checked on the price of brush head replacements and oral-b&#x27;s are much less of a cost then any of the other electric toothbrushes I was considering.  I know I will enjoy this for many years.</li>
            <li> Easy to operate and charges up very well. Teeth feel great and super clean after each use. Only a small amount of toothpaste is needed with each brushing.</li>
            <li> Pleased about the product but after ordered, found one for a lot less money.  Disppointed in price.  Will do a little more research next time.</li>
            <li> When you change a habit for many decades, and the product amaze you.&lt;br /&gt;I use traditional way to wash my teeth for decades, and replace a new one every other month.&lt;br /&gt;Most of my friends use electrical and I always wondering why people like certain kind of brush.&lt;br /&gt;It turns out after I finally got one. It works well with me. No other comparison but it&#x27;s a good start.</li>
            <li> This took over 12 hours to charge initially.  That&#x27;s way too long.  I have been placing it on the charger after each use so it won&#x27;t run down and then have to do with out it until it is recharged.  I does a good job on the surface of my teeth but my old manual does a much better job in between. Having to remove the brush head each time to rinse and then let dry is another disadvantage.  I won&#x27;t be buying another</li>
            <li> both my kids were thrilled to receive these. they both think they are fun to use and my teenager, who is a boy, loves to brush for now. hope it continues to help him want to have fresh breath and teeth!</li>
            <li> I had an earlier generation of this brush. It worked well for six years. I hope that this one will last six years as well. Luckily, it fits the same charger and the same replacement heads!</li>
            <li> I cannot believe i have waited so long to get an electronic toothbrush.  The oral-B Precision 1000 does a fabulous job cleaning my teeth.</li>
            <li> Replaced a larger, heavier product with this. This (plus its stand)  is more conducive to packing for overnights. Replacement heads are readily available too.</li>
            <li> I had other electrical tooth brushes before, but now I can feel the clean power on my teeths after each brush.</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush!  This is as replacement so it&#x27;s not my first Oral-B electric toothbrush.  I have always been happy with this product.</li>
            <li> I just replaced an old Oral B toothbrush.  This is a simple good replacement.  Highly recommend it.  Also the $15 dollar rebate was a good incentive.</li>
            <li> I have had two previous Oral-B battery powered tooth brushes. They worked well except eventually the battery compartment cracked and the toothbrushes stopped working. The rechargeable toothbrush is superior to the battery powered brushes because the housing does not crack.</li>
            <li> This brush has few of the bells and whistles of pricier models, but does an efficient job.  It does have the 30 second warnings...which are helpful.  Good buy and sufficient for the task.</li>
            <li> I switched from a manual toothbrush. The charge lasts a long time, and it cleans effectively. My teeth were already in fine shape, so given that, I think this was a good value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The charger base gets a little gross looking after a couple days from water running down on it (I think), but it cleans off pretty easily.</li>
            <li> This is my first electric toothbrush ever. I brush well anyway, and floss twice daily, but this thing brings tooth brushing to a whole new level. It&#x27;s inexpensive, works great and vibrates every 30 seconds so you know how long you&#x27;re brushing your teeth. At first I didn&#x27;t like that, but I usually brush my teeth for three minutes or so anyway. It ended up being a blessing in disguise. It&#x27;s also easier to reach way around the back teeth, considering the smaller, round head in comparison to a normal toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This thing also feels great on your gums. I&#x27;ll never go back to a regular old toothbrush again.</li>
            <li> I have used a variety of these for years. This is my second of this type. The first one had a bad battery from the start, and I never got around to replacing it. It would run down sitting in a suitcase on a trip and be quite slow that night in the hotel unless it had charging time first. It never was very fast. Resulted in more stain than usual on my teeth. The new one is better, but not up to the published claims they make about time between charges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I believe that this product overall is a critical part of my regimen, and a manual brush or something cheaper would mess with success. I have basically beaten back periodontal disease, such that there is no change for many years now. The other elements of this success include brushing twice daily, flossing once thoroughly at night, and then a thorough water-picking at a low pressure after the floss (with my waterpik purchased from Amazon, of course). It is also important to find a good hygienist who is serious about cleaning out the pockets, and doesn&#x27;t just give you a quick rush job with a cavitron.</li>
            <li> Received it quickly and immediately started using.  One thing I don&#x27;t like is the brush got soft too soon, 1 week, and it doesn&#x27;t have the two speeds as advertised.  Also suppose to last for 7 days without a charge, but only lasted 3.</li>
            <li> I ordered this , then cancelled.  Reason:  I got my older unit working.  I really like this brush, so I reordered.  So when necessary I will reorder.</li>
            <li> I purchased these so my kids would want to brush their teeth and because I&#x27;m sick of cavities. They really like it.</li>
            <li> This was a Christmas gift for my son who put it on his wish list.  He has been very happy with it and says he loves using it.  It works well, is easy to use, and he is a fan of the way the brushes work.  I chose it because of the cost and because I didn&#x27;t want to invest too much in case he didn&#x27;t like an electric toothbrush.  This time l was lucky and got a great product for a great price.</li>
            <li> I love this electric tooth brush.  It&#x27;s very good price and really helps cleaning all around my teeth; bright and fully clean!</li>
            <li> This works well getting to problem spots in the back of the mouth. The circular motion gets up under the gums.&lt;br /&gt;Nice brush, slender, charger stand does  not take up much room on the counter.</li>
            <li> Oral-B is a great brand and this unit has extra-soft brush heads available for those with sensitive gums (like me). I&#x27;ve used Oral-B toothbrushes for years and they last and last. This is the best looking of all that I&#x27;ve had. Very small charger base, easy to hold handle, takes the standard Oral-B head series. Perfect for good oral hygiene.</li>
            <li> I bought this electric tooth brush for my wife and I was very skeptical about her acceptance after some unpleasant experience with another brand. She liked it from day one and she&#x27;s very satisfied with it after nearly two months of use. Great product.</li>
            <li> Loved my first brush and it lasted for years. Bought the newer version and have been greatly pleased with it.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is okay.  It does an adequate job but I have decided to upgrade to a Philips Sonicare Toothbrush after hearing a coworker tell me how her dentist raved about how her teeth and gums have improved since she starting using it.</li>
            <li> Battery lasts quite a while between charges, and I like the small roundness of the brush head, good for reaching small areas.  I would definitely recommend this, don&#x27;t spend more $ on a SonicCare.</li>
            <li> Seems to be the low cost lower quality unit.</li>
            <li> I really love this tooth brush.  I realized I have not been brushing long enough per the timer on this unit.  I really like the 30 second intervals.  It&#x27;s easy to recharge (takes about 24 hrs).  Once it starts blinking red, I plug it in and by the next morning it is charged.  I only need to charge it once a week (I don&#x27;t want the charger out on my counter, I only bring it out to charge).  Someone complainted about it getting gunky, but all you do is pop the head off when you rinse it, it takes like 5 seconds and then pop it back on.</li>
            <li> Oral B strikes again, we wore out the last pair and loved them too. They lasted 4 years, then we bought the cheaper model and it sucks. Did not last 2 years and charge now only lasts a day.  The new ones (these) I got 12 days use out of a single charge.</li>
            <li> This is the first electric toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever used.  It takes a long time to charge, but otherwise it seems to work real well.</li>
            <li> good but it took a long time to be fully charged.</li>
            <li> In love with this toothbrush, my teeth never felt so clean. It feels like I&#x27;m getting dentist treatment at home. Fast shipping, great price!</li>
            <li> Arrived on time.  Great product.  My wife loves it also.</li>
            <li> After years of faithful duty, my Oral-B &amp;#34;Vitality&amp;#34; toothbrush bit the dust.  I replaced it with this toothbrush and I am thrilled with it.  Two features make it much better than my old one.  I like the fact that it stutters after 30 seconds, letting me know it is time to move on to another place in my mouth &amp; I like the light that lets me know it is time to recharge it.  For new buyers....  it takes quite awhile (up to 22 hours) for the first charge.  So, don&#x27;t worry about it.</li>
            <li> I really like this brush.  My teeth feel as clean as after the dentist!  And it seems to get between the teeth and onto the gums better than my previous one.</li>
            <li> Met all expectations.</li>
            <li> Works the same as a $200 toothbrush for a fraction of the price. Definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> Love this brush.  Head rotates super fast.  Very suprised at speed.  Been using it for a few months now and seems to be doing a very good job.</li>
            <li> Small size gets in to more spaces than larger sized brushes. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is liquid settles into the base of the holder and looks gross. Needs to be cleaned nearly every day. Would buy Oral-B brand again.</li>
            <li> This is the quality of any electric toothbrush. It will not perform like the Sonic Care series with regards to plaque removal. It performs as described, but I actually prefer a manual brush to this one.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush makes you feel like you just had a cleaning at the dentist. Easy to use and we replacement heads are available when needed.</li>
            <li> I purchased this based on the review on The Wirecutter and I&#x27;m glad I followed their advice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let&#x27;s be honest: it&#x27;s a toothbrush.  It doesn&#x27;t need a ton of special features, it just needs to get your teeth clean.  And this does the job.  As the review on The Wirecutter mentions, and as confirmed with a simple search, the sonic toothbrushes are really just a marketing gimmick and all the extra cleaning options don&#x27;t really add any true benefit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having used it for a few months now, I have no regrets.  It has a small, powerful head that allows you to reach all areas of your mouth.  Unlike some weaker brushes, I can feel that this is really getting my teeth clean.  It has a very indiscreet &amp;#34;skip&amp;#34; in the vibration every 30 seconds, with a &amp;#34;double skip&amp;#34; at two minutes to help you ensure a proper brushing time.  This feature alone makes this brush worth the purchase over simple brushes.  I&#x27;m sure I often got impatient when brushing with simple brushes and stopped brushing too quickly without some guide to gently remind you that you need to brush for two minutes.  I focus on a quarter of my teeth for each 30 seconds and then move on.  I&#x27;ve actually noticed a difference in the feel and look of my teeth after using this brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The charging base is also easy to use.  The brush sits on top of the base and charges wirelessly.  The base is concave and ends up getting a little gunky no matter how clean I think my brush is after use, but it&#x27;s simple to clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, after my research, I decided this brush offered the best value without going overboard on silly features.  I also have no doubts about it&#x27;s quality: it&#x27;s a Braun brush made in Germany and I plan on having it for a long time.</li>
            <li> I bought this product about 2 years ago and it is still running great. It holds the charge well. It&#x27;s a good quality product.</li>
            <li> Great product! I owned a previous 8 year old model that still works and updated to this one just because. It has awsome power! Great improvement.</li>
            <li> Good luck finding a replacement head!  I just bought replacement heads which the package indicated would be for the \\&quot;Vitality Sonic Oral-B\\&quot;.  My toothbrush has printed on it:  \\&quot;Oral-B Vitality\\&quot;.  Wouldn&#x27;t YOU think the brushes would be compatible?  They are not!  Why would the company sell \\&quot;Vitality\\&quot; replacements for a \\&quot;Vitality\\&quot; toothbrush that aren&#x27;t compatible?  Incompetence?  Pre-meditated scam?  You decide.  Do NOT buy this product.</li>
            <li> This model replaced one that I had owned for probably 10 years.  It works great &amp; is very reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> My dental hygienist recommended my getting an electric brush due to excessive tartar build-up between my 6 month cleanings. I went with the Oral B Pro 1000 since its brush head looked like the best choice for me due to still having all my wisdom teeth and the need to get back to those teeth. The brush has exceeded my expectations regarding cleaning all my teeth. I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a first-rate electric tooth brush at a value price.</li>
            <li> These are just refills for the main product.  These are just fine for the product they are adaptable to.</li>
            <li> Bought as a gift.  The person really likes it and has had better check-ups as a result!!</li>
            <li> Great product.  Been using them for several years.</li>
            <li> ok for the price, not as good as original</li>
            <li> This is a good product that I paid $40 for. Then I found out my wife had ordered the twin pack for $50..a better deal and double the pulses per minute from this one. This 20k one makes my nose itch when I use it (weird huh). The 40k ones don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Excellent product for the price (this is the best price I have found for this product). Takes some getting used to but love how clean my teeth feel after!</li>
            <li> Oral HYGienist says, &amp;#34;whatever you&#x27;re doing, don&#x27;t stop.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> well truthfully, i bought this because i didnt want to drop double the $ on sonicare--i figured test drive this baby and then if i feel like its worth it, i will consider the investment in sonicare. well about a few weeks in, i can say that i still like regular brushing over this. i tend to stay away from battery operated anything and a toothbrush is no exception here. i just prefer the feel and weight of an ergonomic toothbrush. i get the kids sized and make sure its super soft and i just go at it--with this ive found there is a lot of thought involved, its just not as routine yet.</li>
            <li> great simple electric toothbrush- replacing one that died after many years.  works well</li>
            <li> My son likes this toothbrush and uses it daily. Seems to clean teeth well and has a long battery life.</li>
            <li> Teeth have never been cleaner! Love this thing.</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush!!! Easy to use...turn it on and go. I bet my next dental exam will be a piece of cake.</li>
            <li> Not as good as the Braun I&#x27;ve been using.</li>
            <li> I have returned the product, not because there was any problem with the product but because it could not be used in Australia as the voltage was incompatable. i would have thought that if you are shipping a product to Australia it would have to be usable .</li>
            <li> I own a sonic-care and I ordered this as a second brush that brush&#x27;s differently (circular) It took one day to fully charge, it has very good power ,just don&#x27;t press down to hard on your teeth to much, I like all the optional brush heads available, unlike sonic-care,It cleans very well and leaves your gums feeling good,I&#x27;ll post more upon how it holds up !</li>
            <li> My teeth feel cleaner with this than with the much more expensive Philips model I had.  Also, it&#x27;s easier to keep clean.  Any drips will collect on the open base rather than inside the toothbrush holder like the Philips, which was so disgusting it eventually prompted me to discard it.  The only caveat with this Oral-B is that you need to be conscious of using on each tooth.  The head is much smaller.  That has it advantages, however, like reaching the farthest molars.</li>
            <li> I had a previous version of this brush from around 2003-2004, and it was still going strong...except the brush heads started to fit loosely (i.e. they would fall off if I turned the brush upside down). Surprisingly, I was still able to brush fairly well, and the rechargeable battery still worked fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally decided to replace the thing when I saw the price on this new one (plus $15 off from a mfg rebate). A new version for $30? Sign me up. I was additionally pleased that the Oral-B/Braun folks still use the same size charger -- I set the new brush on the old charger and it started charging immediately (I like the old charger because it has a brush-head holder attached). Nice to think a company out there doesn&#x27;t obsolete a perfectly good induction charging system just because it is a decade (or more) old. So, now I have a spare charger in case I would need it for some reason (it is more compact, so if I traveled for a long time, it would be nice to have around...)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not sure how many vibrations/rotations my old brush had, but this one feels like there is more motion overall. The oscillations are still very &amp;#34;tight&amp;#34;, and (obviously) the brush heads fit perfectly and snugly now (brush heads that worked on the old brush all work on this new brush, another nice thing for them to have left alone!).</li>
            <li> This is my second one, the battery wore out on the first one and it was cheaper to just replace the whole thing.  Since I have been using this product my dentist appointments for cleanings have been great and that was what it was all about for me!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used battery powered brushes before, but my dentist said an electric brush was better. I looked at a variety of models and decided I wanted something with a rotating head. This fit the bill and I&#x27;ve been pleased with it.</li>
            <li> Cleans  10 times better than my old Oral -B !!</li>
            <li> Awesome. Should have got an Oral B years ago. Used to be my mouth only felt this clean after a dentist visit. I got mine for $35, and the next time I searched Amazon I couldn&#x27;t find them for less than 65. Just good luck for me. What a bargain!</li>
            <li> This is a great toothbrush. I like how it has a built in timer. It definitely gets the job done.</li>
            <li> I already own one of these and purchased another to have at my dad&#x27;s place (out of state) while visiting him there.  It&#x27;s a great little toothbrush.</li>
            <li> This product seems to get the job done. I like it and my teeth feel clean after use. I don&#x27;t think the battery lasts as long as advertised though.</li>
            <li> I must say it makes teeth brush more effective than normal way. And the battery is also good, normal I charge each week.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is incredible. I don&#x27;t believe you will get a better product for the price. The toothbrush went beyond my expectations in removing surface stains on my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The refill brush heads are a bit on the pricey side though.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a week now and I like it very much.  I don&#x27;t have anything to compare it to, as I have never used an e-toothbrush before, so that is why I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I used a Rotadent for a year and a half, felt it was good, it wasn&#x27;t the latest model. Things I didn&#x27;t like:&lt;br /&gt;Short battery life with little warning before dying.&lt;br /&gt;Poorly designed stand.&lt;br /&gt;Expensive brush heads.&lt;br /&gt;Very particular what type of toothpaste used or the heads would wear out really fast.&lt;br /&gt;Hard to get a good cleaning without toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Things I think are better about the Oral-B:&lt;br /&gt;I can use any toothpaste I want.&lt;br /&gt;Brush heads are reasonably priced.&lt;br /&gt;Lets you know when the batteries are running out.&lt;br /&gt;Teeth feel cleaner.&lt;br /&gt;More maneuverable in the mouth.&lt;br /&gt;Very nice mechanical design, feels like a professional tool.&lt;br /&gt;I can get brush heads without going to the dentist or grey market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anybody want to buy a year and a half old Rotadent with a worn out brush head : )</li>
            <li> Does what it says it does. Cleans teeth and gums just fine. I really like the 30 second buzz feature to make sure that you aren&#x27;t spending too much time on one part of your mouth.</li>
            <li> This is everything you need in an electric toothbrush. My mom was so impressed that she bought the same one. Keep an eye out on the Oral-B site for rebates, too.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush works well, but after just a month of use it only holds enough of a charge for one or two uses. It&#x27;s frustrating to have to constantly charge the toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Easy to use. Fits in your mouth much better than the rectangular head of a regular toothbrush. Cleans between teeth and massages gums. Perfect speed. Better than the one my dentist sold me for $160.00.</li>
            <li> I am using the older version since 2001 and it still works great. I had to buy this new version because the charger of the old one was damaged and Braun has discontinued that version. I couldn&#x27;t find any charger replacement. I have to say this is the only negative point about this product. The charger works only with 110 Volt. In my last vacation I tried to use the charger with a 220 to 110 volt converter and the charger got damaged even with converter. Just be aware of this weak point and go for it. It works great and runs for many years.</li>
            <li> It is very slow to start.  Button is hard to press on.  Slow motion.  Cheaper than the older version I had, so I guess I shouldn&#x27;t have expected it to be as powerful.</li>
            <li> My teeth feel noticeably cleaner than with manual brushing!  I like the 30 second interval signals which encourage me to be consistent in brushing the different sections of my teeth.  I think replacement brushes are way over-priced.</li>
            <li> I recently piurchased thge oral-b 1000 rechargable toothbrush &amp; the product didn&#x27;t operate from the start.  I tried recharging at various outlets in my house &amp; it still didn&#x27;t operate.  I trashed it.</li>
            <li> I was shocked at the quality of this toothbrush because it was not expensive.  It stays charged up for a long time.  I LOVE it and recommend it to everyone because it does clean your teeth MUCH better than a manual brush ever could!  I wish I would have introduced a product like this for my children at about age 3.  Hope bunches of parents read this.</li>
            <li> We have used these for AGES,,,they have recently updated the battery and charging system, and needed to be replaced. These can also take the small round heads, or the larger more regular toothbrush looking heads - both work great, and the toothbrush has a time that lets you know when you have hit every quadrant of your mouth successfully and lets you know when your have finished up! Nice gadget! *On a side bonus...you can clean your rings with it!</li>
            <li> I use the toothbrush two to three times a day. I had it replaced once because the motor skips as if it&#x27;s going to quit, but doesn&#x27;t. I complained and got another one. This one skips as well. It is hard to turn on and off. I have to use my thumbnail. When I recharge it, it blinks a green light enough to light up the room. I&#x27;ve had oral B toothbrushes before and they were of much higher quality.</li>
            <li> more powerful than last model - great value for this price, too - would recommend to anyone who wants really clean teeth</li>
            <li> Bought one for myself after growing tired of Spin Brush battery life issues.&lt;br /&gt;3 weeks later bought one for my wife.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This + the Oral-B flosser makes for a great oral care duo.</li>
            <li> Great, easy to use brush.  I&#x27;m a former dental hygienist and very happy with the results. I would definitely recommend this prod</li>
            <li> I used to have a higher model but decided to try the this model. So far I am very pleased with it.  There is only one speed, which is fine because I only used one speed on my old model. It does take about 12 hours to charge it once the battery is fully depleted.  This one doesn&#x27;t vibrate compared to the higher level model....not sure how much the vibration did for cleaning my teach.  It does pulse every 30 seconds so you know when to switch quadrants. I would highly recommend  this brush for the price.</li>
            <li> This is definitely better than manual brushes as well as the various other electric toothbrushes I have used. My dental hygienist noticed the improvement in plaque reduction and the built in timer helps to guide your brushing so that you don&#x27;t fluke yourself into bad teeth. This is one toothbrush that works hard to help foul mouths everywhere. No complaints yet, keep it charged up every couple of days to make sure the brush is at optimal speed.</li>
            <li> I love it! The brush head seems small at first but is totally effective. The pauses/alerts are intentional (read the manual).</li>
            <li> What can you say. Oral-B has cornered the market on oral hygiene. This is the base model in their pro series, but for us, its all we need. Powerful, long lasting on a single charge and with it&#x27;s built in timer you always spend the right amount of time doing what needs to be done. Don&#x27;t even consider any other product, your teeth are too important to gamble on a &amp;#34;maybe&amp;#34; product.</li>
            <li> This is my 2nd Oral B. My first finally bit the dust after 13 years. I think it&#x27;s an excellent value</li>
            <li> Far better than my last Oral-B&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The very narrow head makes brushing much easier and comfortable to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The little charging light is also a nice touch.</li>
            <li> After the first time brushing my teeth with this gem my teeth felt as clean as if I just left the dentist for a teeth clean. This tooth brush is definitely worth all $39 which is pretty cheap for an electric toothbrush. I love it! I&#x27;ll be ordering my hubby one of these too! Awesome</li>
            <li> Love this!  Had to replace my old, worn out Oral-B toothbrush and this was just what I wanted.  I did let it charge overnight (12 hrs), but it&#x27;s been working for days on that charge!  It&#x27;s quiet, the &amp;#34;pulsing&amp;#34; reminder to move to another quadrant is gentle.  The size is perfect for my hand and mouth.  Such a deal for the price.  Super happy with my new toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Works well. Helps provide better cleaning at reasonable cost. Holds charge, lasts, brushes replaceable. Simple model. Not much to go wrong.</li>
            <li> This is a great toothbrush.  We bought it after my wife&#x27;s Sonicare died (3 months of use and it quit).  We are sticking with Oral-B.  A year later and still going strong.</li>
            <li> I have used Oral B electric toothbrushes for many years. This 1000 model only proves the company upgrades performance  and quality consistently. after brushing, your teeth are totally clean. You know the feeling after your teeth were cleaned at your dentist, it is the same every time you brush! Gums are healthier. My Dentist says my exams are alway good. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I was trying to replace the no-longer-made Oral B Sonic Complete (that I LOVED) and this is what I chose. However,&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#62;Its handle and body is too lightweight for me.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#62;The noise of the motor reverberates in my mouth&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#62;It&#x27;s not my Sonic Completer. Please Oral B, bring it back!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used it now three days and dislike it so much it&#x27;s headed for the trash bin).</li>
            <li> So far, so good. I haven&#x27;t had an electric brush in ages and it&#x27;s wonderful to have really clean teeth again without gag-inducing giant toothbrush heads.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to order one more for my boyfriend. well made, easy to clean, very convenient. now I need to order refill brushes</li>
            <li> I purchased this as a replacement for my Philips e-series (the battery had finally died after 2-3 years). I will be taking it back. The battery seems to die a little during brushing. Also, it doesn&#x27;t cut off after 2+ minutes (which is partly why I like electronic toothbrushes). Also, there is no &amp;#34;quadrant indicator&amp;#34; as advertised. Maybe I got a dude?</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why people like this toothbrush.  The battery has already slowed down to the point where I have to keep the brush on he charger all the time.  The head action is clumsy and a little rough.  I liked the water pick much better, but it also had issues with the charger and battery.  Overall I wouldn&#x27;t buy this again.</li>
            <li> it is my first electric toothbrush,I like it and use it everyday.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t spend money on a more expensive model.  This little machine is simple and gets the job done!</li>
            <li> I am brushing the right way.  It took a few times to get used to the vibration in my mouth but once I did, I feel like I&#x27;m REALLY getting my teeth clean, finally!!!</li>
            <li> I had another brand toothbrush that was battery powered.  When it worked, it was great but it often failed to work for me.&lt;br /&gt;Consequently, I decided to try a rechargeable toothbrush and started with the best priced Oral-B 1000.  I&#x27;m delighted to&lt;br /&gt;say I&#x27;m very pleased with it and happy I ordered it from Amazon.  Got an excellent deal and that made the purchase even&lt;br /&gt;nicer!</li>
            <li> they  like them thank you</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this product. I purchased it in 2012 it is now 2014 and this Oral-B is still going strong. I do change the brush head every two or three months. It is by far the best I have ever used. I have recommended it to my two adult children and they are very pleased with it also.  I wish I had purchased an Oral-B earlier instead of using a manual toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;Update: It is now October 2015 and this product is still going strong. I am extremely pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I own 2 of these and love them! The one this one replaced lasted 12 years before the battery failed to hold a charge! I only wish I could find a brush with stiffer bristles! I heartily recommend this toothbrush!</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with this toothbrush.  It performs as I had hoped it would!</li>
            <li> Great brush. Just ordered a second one for my wife. Awesome price. No need for all the bells and whistles of other models. This one is great, and holds a charge for a couple weeks.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush performs well, and my teeth feel clean after usage. My only complaint is that it takes abnormally long to finish completely charging.</li>
            <li> This was replacement for the Oral-B I used for 20 years.  It has some  advancements on the old one, and it&#x27;s just as good. Very happy  I stayed with the brand.  Hope it lasts another 20 years.</li>
            <li> A great product at a great price.  I wish I had purchased one years ago.  Teeth have never been cleaner, and it&#x27;s quick and easy.</li>
            <li> I ordered this to replace another Oral B toothbrush that was on the fritz. I have no complaints - it works well, and I don&#x27;t find it to be super loud the way some other people mentioned. I like the reminders to change your brushing area. It&#x27;s only been a week, but so far, so good!</li>
            <li> This is my second Oral-B toothbrush. I love the Oral-B electric toothbrush. I feel as if I get a better brushing as opposed to manual brushing. Other than the price to replace the brush heads which are costly, I really like the Oral-B and will continue using it.</li>
            <li> Teeth feel very clean after using this toothbrush and I like that it has 4 30 second timers for each quadrant of your mouth. The new charging base also makes it easier to clean.</li>
            <li> great price on a great product</li>
            <li> Does a wonderful job of cleaning teeth. Holds charge for a week of cleaning.</li>
            <li> Great deal for the price.</li>
            <li> Need to add a rubberized foot so that it does not slide on our Travertine floor.</li>
            <li> impossible to change the brushl  No instrufyion included</li>
            <li> This was a Christmas gift for our 20 year old son and he loves it!  Score for the parents...</li>
            <li> Works great, this is my second one, wouldn&#x27;t have any other!</li>
            <li> this toothbrush is awesome so far! I&#x27;ve been using it for about 2 weeks and it&#x27;s definitely better than a manual toothbrush. The charge takes about 24 hours and that will last 1 week until the next charge. I really like the 30 second timer for each quadrant, it&#x27;s really helpful. Hopefully this toothbrush will last a long time!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t hold a charge as long as I would like and recharging takes the better part of a day, but for the price I really can&#x27;t complain too much about that.  I&#x27;m also not a big fan of the stuttering quadrant timer, but that&#x27;s just a personal preference and not a big deal.  Others may find it really handy.  Overall, it seems to do a good job of scrubbing my teeth and the bristles on the head are soft enough to make me think they&#x27;re cleaning under the gumline and not damaging my enamel.  I&#x27;ve only had the toothbrush for a month or so, so I guess durability will be the only question with this product. In short, it has its minor flaws, but so far I&#x27;m satisfied that I got a good toothbrush for the price.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a replacement for the Vitality toothbrush which I had previously used and which I was okay with.  Oral B was offering a rebate so I thought I would be buying an improvement to the vitality.  Instead, I was greatly disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The toothbrush doesn&#x27;t operate any better than the Vitality and, like someone else posted, there is a gunk that accumulates at the base of the charger which I have to scrub and soak regularly.  It&#x27;s weird and gross.  Also, water gets trapped in the head and stinks unless you wash it.</li>
            <li> OK product.  Compared to the Philips brand that my wife had before, this one takes a little bit longer to charge the battery and the brushing power is not as strong and no option for different settings.  It was a lot cheaper than the Philips than but it does the job.</li>
            <li> Compact, light with a long lasting battery. A excellent toothbrush to clean the teeth and massage the gums. Replacement brushes are readily available and easy to replace. A great buy!</li>
            <li> GREAT TOOTHBRUSH! Happy customer!</li>
            <li> I enjoy brushing my teeth with it.</li>
            <li> After 3 days i decided to buy one for myself. My wife and I love the Oral Pro 1000.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 36-years-old, and bought my very first electric toothbrush. LOVE it. Can&#x27;t believe I didn&#x27;t purchase one years ago. (I bought it at the suggestion of my dentist). My teeth feel so clean, and look whiter. This toothbrush was easy to figure out, and definitely does the job.</li>
            <li> I just wanted an electric toothbrush that simply brushed my teeth as long as I kept it running.  This works great.  The battery holds a good charge and I just leave it plugged in.  Very simple, very good.</li>
            <li> Works well and direct replacement for another one I had that is now having battery issues.</li>
            <li> Works great. Long battery life. Excellent configuration.</li>
            <li> Sought a relacement for my previous tooth brush, and this one is just fine.</li>
            <li> wonderful price and the brush works great.</li>
            <li> My Dental Hygienist really liked the results of using this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Powerful without being abrasive. You need only use a light touch and can feel this brush cleaning. My teeth &amp;#34;almost&amp;#34; felt young again. You know-slick after a good dental cleaning&lt;br /&gt;Small base uses little space. Very nice- great price!</li>
            <li> Very pleased with the price and delivery date</li>
            <li> This toothbrush replaced a battery one where the head had broken after only a few weeks. The toothbrush has a powerful clean and gives vibration feedback every 30 seconds before a larger more prolonged vibration at 2 minutes to remind you that it is time to stop. All in all a good tooth brush, just a shame that it only comes with a single head and I&#x27;m sure my family could also use this.</li>
            <li> The Wirecutter hit the nail on the head. It lasts long, easy to maintain, doesn&#x27;t require extensive charging (though the charging does take forever).</li>
            <li> I bought this on amazon for under $30, it was a great buy.  I had my previous oral b brush for a long time, this is an improvement with added pulsations in addition to the rotations.  My teeth feel cleaner.  The charge seems to hold for about a week, and it does help me brush with less pressure.</li>
            <li> Big nice, should be improvement...</li>
            <li> Works well as replacement of previous unit (13 years old), the reminder feature is especially helpful to insure you get the job done.</li>
            <li> love this! Light rechargeable and holds the charge a long time.&lt;br /&gt;Great toothbrush too-gets everywhere around your mouth.teeth&lt;br /&gt;feel dentist clean after</li>
            <li> This oral brush is good as advertised. Product effective as described and quite satisfied. All expectations met with no unpleasant surprises.</li>
            <li> I love having a NEW electric toothbrush.  My daughter is a hygienist and said it is the only way to brush your teeth...it has certainly helped keep me cavity free and also kept my gums in great shape!</li>
            <li> I had been using an older version of the current Oral-B 3000 model for the past 8 years, but it finally broke.  I was a bit hesitant to purchase what I thought would be a downgrade, but I figured I only ever used one of the speeds on my old toothbrush, so I might as well save a few bucks and not pay for the other two modes that I would never use.  I&#x27;m happy to report that it works exactly as I expected it to (the single brushing speed is the same as the speed I always used on my old brush) and uses the same replacement brushes.  As a bonus, the base is way smaller than the old one I had.  I never used any of the brush head holders anyways, so I don&#x27;t miss that feature of the charging base at all.</li>
            <li> Takes care of the whole tooth nothing but the tooth so help me.</li>
            <li> Arrived earlier than expected.  Works great!! Will never go back to using a regular toothbrush!! Took on a 3 day weekend and brush maintained a charge throughout my vacation.</li>
            <li> Ordered this to replace my old Oral-B that was finally failing after 8 years! Hope this one will last as long as the last one. This model is more powerful and works with my  existing brush heads. What a relief!</li>
            <li> This is my 3rd Oral-B electric toothbrush. The first one was one of the more expensive models. It worked well, but after only 2-3 years the battery had trouble keeping a charge. I then bought one of the cheap rechargeable models, but never felt like it got my teeth as clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I finally decided to try this model after seeing a rebate offer. In my opinion, it cleans very well. I also like having the :30 zone timer (which is lacking on cheaper models). I&#x27;ve only had it for a few weeks, so we&#x27;ll have to see how the battery works in the long term.</li>
            <li> We purchased the version sold by Costco in pairs, and were immediately turned into big Oral-B fans. The kids got one for Christmas, and the parents came next. This is a great way to brush, doing a much better job than manual brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Skip a couple/three years ahead, and my handset gave up the ghost. Probably the battery. (My wife charges more frequently, and her&#x27;s is just fine.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, what to do?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buying another Costco pair seemed wasteful, since the wife&#x27;s is still working well; so, I started shopping around for a single unit. I discovered there are actually various versions of this product, but figuring out what was worth what was impossible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oral-B needs to make versions feature comparison shopping easier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I rolled the dice, and went cheapest-I-could-find. One handset, this one, not fancy-anything. A rebate made it an even better deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This model is lighter, smaller, less noisy, and seems to run smoother and faster than the Costco version (or maybe it&#x27;s just newer?). But it also feels a bit \\&quot;cheaper\\&quot;, and the light blue color isn&#x27;t attractive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes I care a lot that an item is cheaper-built, and sometimes I am glad I saved a few dollars. In this case, I am happy I went with the cheaper model and saved money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely don&#x27;t need the extra features offered in the higher end versions. Definitely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quality-wise, let&#x27;s face it, any battery will eventually die, and these devices unforgivably do NOT allow for a replacement. If this device could be upgraded with a new battery, a superior-quality build would make sense. But this product is pre-destined to be discarded after a couple/three years, so why pretend it needs more build quality than is necessary for a throw-away consumer item? And I already mentioned that the fancy features of the higher end models make no sense to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t go off on why Oral-B should be more environmentally responsible... and should make this device&#x27;s battery upgrade-able.. but, given that corporate environmental irresponsibility is ubiquitous and typical, I am glad I spent less and still have a good way to take care of the ol&#x27; pearly whites.nd should make this device&#x27;s battery upgrade-able.. but, given that corporate environmental irresponsibility is ubiquitous and typical, I am glad I spent less and still have a good way to take care of the ol&#x27; pearly whites.</li>
            <li> I bought it for my daughter to use with the special brush for braces.  Her teeth look great!  So glad that it had an alternate brush head for her to use.  Her teeth are whiter!</li>
            <li> Bought this to replace an older model that finally bit the dust.  This brush is lightweight and does an excellent job.  Very happy with my purchase - and there was a $20 rebate to boot.</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with this toothbrush.  It does a super job and stays charged many days.  Plus, I took advantage of the $20 rebate, so feel I got an excellent product at a great price!</li>
            <li> Top notch product.  Provides strong cleaning power and charges last through a week vacation. Have bought a couple different versions over the years and happy with all.</li>
            <li> My wife and I like this brush much better than the Sonicare E-series that we used for several years.  It leaves my teeth feeling more clean and also seems to clean between the teeth better.</li>
            <li> I have been using Oral-B rechargeable electric toothbrushes for two years now (I have the older model that was replaced by this one) that I bought at my local grocery store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rechargeable battery is still going strong, which was a concern of mine when purchasing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The quality of my teeth cleaning is drastically improved with an electric toothbrush. I do not feel as clean when I use a regular toothbrush. I change the head about every three months and buy them in bulk to save money.</li>
            <li> My husband says he loves his new tooth brush more than his old oral b vitality tooth brush. He&#x27;s happy.</li>
            <li> Exceeded my expectations. Love the powerful, clean feeling after brushing. Definitely worth the price. Hopefully it will last as long as my previous Oral-B Toothbrush--about six years.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe I waiting so long to get this. My teeth are 100% cleaner. I love the way my mouth feels.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product according to the reviews.  This is my first electronic toothbrush, so can&#x27;t really compare to anything else.  I used the precision clean brush head that it came with and my mouth felt very clean afterwards, but then after purchasing the floss action brush head--wow--even better!</li>
            <li> Teeth get really clean and the small head gets into all the tight places. So much better than manual brushing!</li>
            <li> I am a fanatic about my teeth, I go to the dentist every 6 months, floss and brush multiple times a day. I also use a pick/scaler a few times a week. I used my Oral B for the first time today and my teeth felt clean and polished like I just came from the dentist. I also scaled my teeth after and it was hardly any plaque to be found. Whenever I scale after manual brushing I usually have a notable amount of plaque remaining . I also found the settings to be comfortable on my teeth ( I do not have sensitive teeth) . I just need to order some more heads for my family-I can&#x27;t be the only one in the house with sexy teeth. I would highly recommend this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> After using this toothbrush for a few weeks, I&#x27;m quite pleased with it. It&#x27;s easy to use, easy to keep charged, has a wealth of bristle choices, takes up a small footprint, and seems to work well. I especially like the 30 second timer feature. Would I buy another one? Yes, as a gift for family.</li>
            <li> Clean teeth !&lt;br /&gt;This the basic model with only 2 settings High and off and that&#x27;s all I need.&lt;br /&gt;I had the higher level more expensive model with 2 additional settings that I never used.&lt;br /&gt;Quality and good value.</li>
            <li> This does a good job and is very similar to the one my dentist uses.</li>
            <li> Good product, I switched to electric brush two months ago, and I can feel a big difference in my oral hygiene. I recommend this product to everyone who are brushing their teeth with the conventional brush</li>
            <li> First time I ever paid this much for a toothbrush; always bought the $10 and under ones at the big box store.  This thing is fantastic.  All the Oral-B heads interchange, which is a big plus.</li>
            <li> Works great.  Have 4 in the family and will buy again.  No reliability issues.  Easy to find and replace brushes when necessary.  Overall very good quality.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush it great.  So easy to use and charge, easy to clean and keep clean (though it is an every day maintenance thing).  We have a couple of these and would recommend the toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Good, trustworthy toothbrush. Interchangeable heads are nice. It&#x27;s easy to keep clean. Has 30 second timer so you know how long you&#x27;re brushing is section to get two minutes of brushing in. Like it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase! As my first electronic toothbrush, I spent 2 hours researching consumer &amp; professional reviews, and I picked the &amp;#34;best&amp;#34; one - the one with the highest reviews and best features. It came down to this one and a comparably priced/reviewed SonicCare, but this one was smaller and had a few small advantages. Very happy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 30-second timer is key - don&#x27;t buy a toothbrush without this feature!&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t forget to buy additional heads (I bought the soft heads, bc I heard this is useful for beginners - it was!)&lt;br /&gt;Size and aesthetics are important - you have to look at this and fit it in your bathroom every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy brushing!</li>
            <li> It was actually delivered on a Sunday by the post office. I was shocked. Great product.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace an older version of the same brand and price point.  It works well, requires recharging about once every week or two, and seems well made.  Would have rated 5 stars but find that the power button is not easy to locate because of the handle design.</li>
            <li> A great electric tooth brush for the money.  You can spend more to get less from other products.  I&#x27;ll buy another if and when this one wears out .</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended this toothbrush and I am not disappointed.  Easy to use; stays charged for several weeks; interchangeable brush heads.  A perk is that I find that I use LESS TOOTHPASTE with this brush than conventional toothbrush... so, in time, it will pay for itself.</li>
            <li> I needed a new rechargeable toothbrush since my old oral B finally died. I chose this model because it did what was needed without all the bells and whistles of pricy models and Amazon&#x27;s price was good. The battery life on all the oral B rechargeable brushes is only about 3yrs so why spend extra money? The 1000 is a great toothbrush that works as well as my old one. I like the stutter that lets me know it&#x27;s time to move to another quadrant of my mouth. My old brush only signaled after 2minutes were up. The new model helps me to keep cleaning my teeth with a more regular and even hand. I like the small round brush head of this type of oral B because it fits better in my small mouth and reaches teeth better than larger brush heads especially the teeth in the back of my mouth. The recharger stand is just a small basic oval shape that takes up very little space. I had to fold up the cord and put a rubber band around the extra length because there is no storage for the cord. There is no storage for extra brush heads either but that&#x27;s not a big deal. Overall I am pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I like the compact brush style.  Electric toothbrushes are usually so expensive and the refills are about $8-10 each.  This was much cheaper ($40 I think?) and you can get compatible refills from Target for only $3.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is the classic high-performance tool that Oral-B has offered for years with improvement in the streamline design that takes minimum counter space. Includes new features explained in the instruction booklet. Will not overcharge on stand. Practical for traveling.</li>
            <li> I got this to replace my older version - which is 8 years old &amp; still worked perfectly.  I simply could not get the replacement heads anymore.&lt;br /&gt;This is an excellent update.  I love the fact that it gives you a time for each quadrant you brush which makes me much more careful in brushing all my teeth equally.  Definitely worth the money and does a far better job than manually brushing your tech.</li>
            <li> Works as expected. A thousand times better than brushing manually. If you are on the fence about sticking with your manual toothbrush you need to get this. My mouth feels SOOOO much cleaner.</li>
            <li> With the help of Oral B and some good mouthrinses, my gums are getting so healthy. Great product. Would order again!</li>
            <li> My oral surgeon recommended using the Oral B Professional electronic toothbrush.  He recommended that I use it twice/day for maximum gum stimulation as well as getting my teeth cleaner than with a traditional toothbrush.  My mouth feels exhilarated after a cleaning.  He also stated that I would look forward to brushing again later in the day, and he was certainly right about that.&lt;br /&gt;I can wholeheartedly recommend this product to anyone who is looking for a maximum clean and stimulating toothbrush.</li>
            <li> My dentist has been telling me I need an electric toothbrush for a while, since I have issues with gum-line cavities and enamel erosion, despite my efforts to prevent them.  I kept telling myself I couldn&#x27;t justify the money, but when I finally had the funds (and a recent dental visit showed me a few new &amp;#34;soft spots&amp;#34;), I said I would get it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish I had bought this sooner.  Every single time I brush with this, I get that super-clean feeling I get after going to the dentist for a cleaning.  The smaller head makes it a lot easier to get the backside of the molars, and the different heads allow me to get a deeper and more thorough clean between my teeth and along the gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve even converted my boyfriend, and he&#x27;s never really cared to brush (but still does).  I will definitely be buying a second one for him, and recommending it to family and friends.  It&#x27;s worth the investment, hands down.</li>
            <li> It works okay, but the charge only lasts a week--instead of the three weeks the previous Oral-B I had lasted, and the flashing green light while it is charging is beyond annoying.</li>
            <li> I wish it had a cover.</li>
            <li> Great Product and priced well , would purchase again</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is crazy awesome!!  I upgraded from a different Oral-B electric and talk about an upgrade!  I could feel the difference almost immediately.  My husband and I both love this toothbrush and the awesome coupon that was sent to us after we purchased for replacement heads!</li>
            <li> Works very well. You dentist will also recommend. Easy to use and the price is good. will buy again, great product</li>
            <li> I found this product met all my needs. Whitening , gum health, plaque removal. Fresher breath thus making me more confident. I would definately recomend this to anyone who asks. My dentist is also happy I chose the Oral B Electric Tooth Brush. Thank you.</li>
            <li> Perfect. As expected.</li>
            <li> Returned this item, product page showed brush holder and it did not come with one.</li>
            <li> Works great! I bought two, one for myself and one for my daughter.  She was upset that I bought her a toothbrush, but after using this product she is brushing regularly!  Maybe my next dentist bill will be less.</li>
            <li> He has braces and this stands up pretty well to the hardware. good charger, comes with one extra head. careful withthe o-ring when you replace it.</li>
            <li> Looked at tons of reviews and landed on this model. Have been using it for over a month and I found I like the feel of the brush. I have sensitive teeth, so was a little worried; but so far no issues. I use the Pro White brush heads and have not noticed any brightening, but my teeth do feel cleaner and my gums do not bleed as often when I floss. Am happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> Seems to operate at higher speed than model it replaced.  Leaves teeth feeling very clean and had an especially good report from the dental hygienist after using it for a month.</li>
            <li> I have never used an electric toothbrush before, but decided to get it after my dentist recommended it. One charge lasts for over a week, and I really like the timer. I have no complaints.</li>
            <li> Quick to ship and items are exactly as advertised. I recommend this product to any one looking for same toothbrush</li>
            <li> Highly Recommended.&lt;br /&gt;Well designed, replaceable heads, surprisingly sturdy base, and the&lt;br /&gt;Built in, rather non-intrusive, 2 minute imer feature is perfect.</li>
            <li> As a dentist I wanted an electric toothbrush that was effective.  This brush does the job.  I recommend this Oral-B brush to all my friends, family and patients.</li>
            <li> Seems fine, but the brush doesn&#x27;t do nearly as many RPMs as previous toothbrushes that we&#x27;ve owned.  As I said, it&#x27;s OK</li>
            <li> My wife purchased this for me from Amazon for Christmas because my previous Oral-B of 10 years cratered, so technically I am a verified buyer but it was under her account and she doesn&#x27;t do reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is what I expect from a rechargeable toothbrush:&lt;br /&gt;1) plug unit in to recharge&lt;br /&gt;2) attach head&lt;br /&gt;3) Brush teeth&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pretty simple right? WRONG&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the new age of \\&quot;SMART PRODUCTS\\&quot;:&lt;br /&gt;1) People are stupid&lt;br /&gt;2) People don&#x27;t know how to recharge a toothbrush&lt;br /&gt;3) People don&#x27;t know how to brush their teeth&lt;br /&gt;4) People press too hard when brushing.&lt;br /&gt;5) People need to be told where and how long to brush&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, as a previous Oral-b user I expect the brush to work the same way my previous brush which lasted 10 years to work. WRONG AGAIN! Since companies can&#x27;t come up with any new ideas, they start to try and complicate old ones to make them seem new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So after I wait for the little light to stop flashing (indicating unit is charging because people like to set and watch little flashy lights for hours) which I suppose is much better than waiting for a simple solid green light to come on. I finally get the opportunity to brush my teeth. Remember, all you should have to do is charge and brush. So I am brushing and then about a half a minute the thing makes this godawful stutter then starts back up again. Then 30 seconds later it does it again. I wondered if I got a defective unit so I whip out the owner&#x27;s guide and after going through 3 pages of cautions, I finally get to the operations part.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You see we are too stupid and need a \\&quot;SMART SENSE\\&quot; toothbrush to tell us that every 30 seconds you need to focus on another of the 4 quadrants of your month to brush (Total of 2 minutes brushing time). It&#x27;s like Chinese Water Torture anticipating when that next jolt is going to occur. And if you have to spit before the next jolt, you are just out of luck, because if you turn it off to spit (if you don&#x27;t you get splattered with toothpaste spit removing it from your month while on) it remembers where you were and when you turn it back on... \\&quot;ZAP\\&quot; it gets you again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One other thing and I will stop ranting. They made the on/off button harder to distinguish in the handle. There you are, trying to turn it off so you can spit (spit seems to be such a gross word) fumbling around the handling, pushing what you think is the button, meanwhile your mouth is filling up with spit and you are afraid to take it out while running or you will get splatter. As the spit starts running down your chin, you finally find the on/off button.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom-line:&lt;br /&gt;1) Toothbrush cleans your teeth so I don&#x27;t want to discourage anyone from buying this product.&lt;br /&gt;2) I agree that you should brush all your teeth for a minimal of 2 minutes of total brushing time but the 30 Sec timer should be removed or the consumer given the option of disabling it.&lt;br /&gt;3) Better On/Off Button&lt;br /&gt;4) Oral-B could have made a simpler brush. To me, this timer is just something else that will break down after a short period.you get splattered with toothpaste spit removing it from your month while on) it remembers where you were and when you turn it back on... \\&quot;ZAP\\&quot; it gets you again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One other thing and I will stop ranting.

            <li> Got this as a gift for my hubby.  He is very happy with it and wishes he had asked for it long ago.  Its hard to get excited about a toothbrush, but he likes it.</li>
            <li> Does a nice job, isn&#x27;t too loud, holds a charge for at least a week, has a nice small footprint</li>
            <li> Great unit better than the old one which we used and loved for years.&lt;br /&gt;This unit has a timer to make brushing fun.</li>
            <li> I like this tooth brush a lot.  The cleaning action is very vigorous and I feel that it is very cleaning well.</li>
            <li> I do strongly recommend this product for the following reasons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1-The rotation of the brush is simply put, the best way to clean your teeth. I would not however recommend using it 3 times a day. it could be too harsh and irritate your gum especially if they are irritated already. This product will definitely help after you have a dentist cleaning. It will maintain your level of cleansing untill the next visit.&lt;br /&gt;2-There is a mechanism in this brush to stop it when you are pressing too hard.&lt;br /&gt;3- The ergonomics are not fantastic due to battery,but you quickly learn to adapt to it for proper brushing.&lt;br /&gt;All in all this is a good buy.</li>
            <li> This was ordered as a replacement for an Oral-B Braun electric toothbrush I purchased almost 20 years ago. I hope this one lasts as long as the one its replacing. This unit has improvements and additional features from the old one. In addition to the oscillating action of the brush head, that comfortably and cleans each tooth, this model also now has a pulsating action and is an improvement over the 20 year old model. This pulsating is timed to signal every 30 seconds to properly time the amount of time cleaning each quadrant of the mouth. A good improvement of an already very good electric toothbrush. Comfortable to hold and easy to use for children &amp; adults.</li>
            <li> I purchase this Oral-B to replace a Philips Sonicare that stop working after falling on the floor. I don’t like the Philips Sonicare electric toothbrushes after I purchased three because they’re not sturdy, they make a lot of noise, and you can&#x27;t brush the front of your teeth with your mouth open while facing a mirror because it splatters the toothpaste on the mirror and over the bathroom sink...I actually purchase those Philips Sonicare because of its reviews.  I love this Oral-B electric toothbrush, and my experiences with Oral-B electric toothbrushes. Never again will I change this brand for another.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush lives up to the description in it&#x27;s ad. Thorough and easy to use, easy to clean, and the battery lasts a reasonable amount of time. I&#x27;m glad I got it.</li>
            <li> Felt like the cleanest brushing experience that I have ever experienced.  I love this toothbrush.  Stand for the toothbrush is sleek and very easy to clean.</li>
            <li> It works very well with very little effort.  The charge last for over a week, so traveling with this is great. I would purchase it again if need be.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve wanted one of these for a while and I&#x27;m definitely glad I got it.  It gets my teeth super clean.  I got this model because is was one of the cheapest (~ $40).  However, it&#x27;s not sub-par quality.</li>
            <li> Nothing wrong with it so far. charges over night, ready to use in the morning. Ive been using it for almost about a month and i dont think i need to change the hear yet</li>
            <li> Excellent price on a much recommended product.  Feels like you havejust had your teeth cleansed professionally.  Would make a great gift for anyone.</li>
            <li> Battery lasts a week without charging, making it great for road trips.  The timer notifies you every 30 seconds of the 2 minutes allowing you to time coverage of your mouth by quadrant, if you are into that sort of thing... Easy to use, powerful, effective and takes no room on the countertop for the charger, since it is needed only once per week.  great delivery by Amazon, as always.</li>
            <li> Oral B Professional Care 1000 Electric Toothbrush. Great service, received the product very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;Great product, just as represented. Best ever.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m loving the brush and how great it feels on my teeth and how wonderfully it cleans.  Some people have commented on the sound being too loud (not) and it cutting out being a problem when they are brushing too hard (not a problem...it&#x27;s great for a reminder so that one doesn&#x27;t burn out the toothbrush by how they are using it).  Oral B has #1 products in my book.  This toothbrush is updating an Oral B electric toothbrush I&#x27;ve been using for over 8 years now and can&#x27;t say enough good things about it!  I highly recommend Oral B (anything).</li>
            <li> I believe the sonic care electric toothbrush will be my next purchase. Does not feel my teeth are cleaned after use.</li>
            <li> best electronic toothbrush on the market. I had a  battery powered one- ugh!! the worst !!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this will never stop functioning as long as it is charged on regular basis..</li>
            <li> I really shopped around for a good toothbrush, and although this was not the most expensive model I looked at it is far and away the best one I saw. It a great brush. Re-chargable stand helps you avoid the hassle of changing batteries (and yes, it really is a hassle) and best of all the heads are easily available from after market sellers, through Amazon no less.</li>
            <li> I am on my second one (and the first one is still going strong but has acquired an unpleasant odor over time which I cannot get rid of. But, I did have the first electric brush for 4 years. This Oral B 1000 is great. It does not have all the &amp;#34;bells and whistles&amp;#34; of the more expensive models, but doesn&#x27;t need it. It has a slight jittery motion that alerts you to the fact that you have spent the requisite 30 seconds on one quadrant of your mouth as recommended. This is enough for &amp;#34;bells and whistles&amp;#34;. The brush heads are on the expensive side but I try to hit the sales when buying them. My favorite is the &amp;#34;floss action&amp;#34; brush. My teeth feel so much cleaner than when I brush my teeth by hand. The handle is very comfortable, the battery charge lasts a long time and my teeth are cleaner than when I brush by hand. I always floss along with this brush.</li>
            <li> Toothbrush tends to stutter when in use (loses power every few seconds).&lt;br /&gt;Disappointing but couldn&#x27;t be bothered to return product.</li>
            <li> We have had Oral&#x3D;B toothbrushes for several years. This one was a replacement and is excellent. The price was reasonable and according to my wife it works very well.</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush.  My teeth have never been this clean.  The small head allows for precision brushing and avoiding the gums.  The battery life is ok, not great.  Take the charger with you if you are traveling for more than 1 night.</li>
            <li> This is my 2nd. oral-B and I am very satisfied. I was not sure if the newer model would be as well made as the first I purchased over ten years ago. I am pleasantly surprized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What discussed me most was the rebate promised.  I sent them every bar code on the box it was shipped in and a copy of the bill and payment as requested. About three weeks later they send a letter informing me the rebate is denied for not providing all the information as requested.  I think the rebate programs are a scam. Just something to entice you into purchasing their products.</li>
            <li> I love my new tooth brush, teeth and gums feel very healthy. I was experiencing difficulty getting into hard to reach places. This toothbrush does the job. Worth the cost.</li>
            <li> This is my Second Oral B and I love it.  When traveling I don&#x27;t leave home with out it. I would be lost with out it.</li>
            <li> The product is good but the $20 rebate trick was disgusting! I bought 5 of this item, one for each of my family members, and expected to get $100 rebate and received only $20 in total. I phoned them and they asked me to read the rebate form one more time and I realized it was $20 per address, period. So the $20 is true ONLY IF you buy one. I am sure I was not the only one who got fooled. Be careful!</li>
            <li> It works very well, but the neck is a little too long for me.</li>
            <li> Have been using another brand of electric toothbrush for years, but didn&#x27;t know how terrible it was until I started using the Oral-B!  What a difference in cleaning power.  I am thoroughly happy with it!</li>
            <li> Ok, so the toothbrush itself probably deserves more than one star--it works fine, brushes nicely when you push the button, etc.  What has made me very upset about this whole experience is the rebate. It meets U.S. code&#x27;s definition of mail fraud--\\&quot;having devised or intending to devise a scheme to defraud....use of the mail for the purpose of executing, or attempting to execute, the scheme.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put great care into sending an Amazon receipt, the properly filled out rebate form, and the original UPC from the toothbrush in a VERY well-sealed (tape reinforced) envelope.&lt;br /&gt;I get a letter back saying the rebate request is incomplete because they did not receive an original UPC--can I please send it. Ok, so what happens when I send in a photocopy (since I, of course, no longer have the original UPC?) You guessed it. They can&#x27;t use a photocopy.&lt;br /&gt;This same EXACT story has happened to a friend of mine who recently purchased this toothbrush. She got the exact same rejection letter (after sending away the original UPC in a carefully sealed envelope.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t bother me so much to have lost $20. What bothers me is that Proctor and Gamble has the balls to open rebate letters, toss UPC&#x27;s in the trash, and send out rejection letters. And that they get away with it. Because the customer has no recourse--they no longer have the original UPC.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I certainly don&#x27;t have recourse...I can&#x27;t prove I ever sent an original UPC in to them now, can I? A photocopy can be from anything. But I can warn others. Don&#x27;t assume you&#x27;ll get the rebate because you jumped through all the right hoops and sent in the right stuff. You quite possibly wont.</li>
            <li> Expected a little larger head, but love everything else about it.</li>
            <li> I love this electric toothbrush.  This is the second one I&#x27;ve owned and it has made a tremendous difference, even my dentist has noticed.</li>
            <li> Was suggested on dr. Oz. Love the tooth brush. Just doesn&#x27;t clean tongue well. But we&#x27;ll worth every dollar. ;)</li>
            <li> The item was packaged and shipped to my expectations. I hope this item outlasts the earlier/different model (used for 4 years), which had to be scrapped after water ingress into the motor housing - causing severe rusting.</li>
            <li> This is my second Oral-B toothbrush.  After 5 years the battery in the first one decided it was time to retire.  However I liked the first one so much that I purchased this second one.  I prefer the circular motion versus the back-and-forth method of other brushes.  This is a very nice toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Delivery within days. Product is exactly as shown. The product I bought was a toothbrush Oral B Prof 1000. It is proving to be worth the cost. This is my first electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t bother buying this cheap version. I&#x27;ve been using Oral-B power brushes for years, but this one is a dud. This brush made my entire head vibrate like a jack hammer, was very loud, and gave me VERY SORE gums after just one use. I bought an Oral-B Triumph Professional Care two years ago and it&#x27;s wonderful. I should have known better than to buy a cheaper model. Per Oral-B&#x27;s 100% satisfaction guarantee, I will be returning this brush.</li>
            <li> Great product, leaves your teeth feeling silky clean. Would recommend it.Have always used the Oral-B electric toothbrushes and this is an improvement on the others we have had.</li>
            <li> So far the toothbrush has been fine.  However, I know from previous experience, that the item might have problems down the road so I&#x27;ll wait and see.</li>
            <li> does a wonderful job of cleaning and making your teeth feel very clean.  Now checking to see how white they get in two months.</li>
            <li> The best I have ever used as the rotation does a super job and my teeth feel like they have been professionally cleaned</li>
            <li> I love the electric brush. I&#x27;ve been using it for 5 days &amp; my teeth are whiter than before.&lt;br /&gt;It reaches places I could not reach with my old tooth brush.</li>
            <li> I should have listened to the &amp;#34;cons&amp;#34;. I have always used the Sonicare toothbrush and I guess I was spoiled. They said these were loud and vibrated a lot but since they had four and a half stars, I figured they must be ok, and I&#x27;ll save a lot of money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, they were loud and vibrated really hard, and were  really rough on my teeth. so rough that I threw them in the trash. I then ordered the Sonicare and they came in, and I noticed the difference immediately,,</li>
            <li> i really like the quality of this toothbrush for the price absolutely no complaints&lt;br /&gt;im sure that you could pay a lot more but i dont think it would be worth it</li>
            <li> This is the first electric toothbrush I have used in more than 40 years, but it&#x27;s great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Teeth seem dentist clean&lt;br /&gt;Small charging stand&lt;br /&gt;Vibrates every 30 seconds to indicate  move to next quadrant&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;None</li>
            <li> This product was recommended to me by my dental hygienist.  She said that I needed it because I still have my wisdom teeth and a conventional tooth brush will not reach back far enough to adequately brush them.  She said to do with the plug in models as they have more power than the battery operated ones.  This is my first electric toothbrush and I can not believe the difference from regular brushing.  It was very easy to set up.  Also the 30 second triggers are great to tell you when to switch quadrants. The price was pretty steep for me when compared to a regular tooth brush, but now seeing the performance was worth it.  Also Amazon stayed true the their word of price matching and was very quick (&amp;lt;24hrs) to respond to my pricing challenge.</li>
            <li> The bristles are dangerously hard.  Hard on the gums.  I didn&#x27;t like the feel of it.  Perhaps I should have gotten the more expensive one.</li>
            <li> We were looking for an additional Oral B brush for a decent price.  We really didn&#x27;t use the fancy display on all of the others we&#x27;ve had and found this one works the same as the fancy versions.</li>
            <li> Wonderful toothbrush!  I was so happy to find this item at such a reasonable price as I&#x27;ve seen them in stores for 3 times as much.  I wish the replacement toothbrush heads were cheaper.</li>
            <li> I bought this toothbrush for my children along with a bigger model for the adults. The kids all have their own head and share the base. These toothbrushes are way better than conventional or battery powered brushes. They do an outstanding job at cleaning teeth. One of the best features is the alert to let you know the particular quadrant is done. The alarm give you 30 seconds per quadrant for a total time of 2 minutes brushing. Fantastic product that my family will not go without again.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for myself from Walmart a few years ago &amp; LOVE it! There were more expensive models but I chose this one. Mine has been going strong with no issues. I love the feature that tells me when I have brushed long enough on each quadrant and also tells you when you have brushed long enough overall. I tend to over brush so this is great for me. I purchased this again for my husband and he loves it too. It is a GREAT product for a GREAT price. I believe it was cheaper here on Amazon than at Walmart. I buy a large pack of replacement heads for it once a year at Costco at a great price. Sometimes I have heads left over at the end of the year too. My checkups at the dentist prove it works better than regular brushing. I do not irritate my gums by brushing too hard anymore (I have gum recession from doing this with my regular toothbrush). It also warns you if you are pressing too hard! I have been cavity free for over 2 years now!</li>
            <li> Very basic...no storage space for heads, so if you use this for more than one person, upgrade to the next model.  Also doesn&#x27;t show a time so that you know how long you have brushed.</li>
            <li> After 3 months of use this tooth bush has started to fail to hold a charge and is none usable.  In looking at Amazon&#x27;s policies they will not return it after 2 months.  Frustrated that Amazon doesn&#x27;t at least provide a way confirm contact for warranty back up.  Unfortunately didn&#x27;t keep the box or documents which came with it.  As a Prime member was let down with the performance of the product and really had hoped for better back up from Amazon.  Bought same produce through store and it&#x27;s working well but appears I got stuck with faulty product from Amazon.</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended this power brush.  After using it just 3 times, I noticed that my teeth really FEEL cleaner!  Also, it really massages the gum-line very well, too. The cleaning action is a combination of a rotating brush that vibrates at the same time.  Best of all is the waterproof design of the recharging mechanism that has no exposed contacts. Minor downside: when charging, a green light on the handle flashes very brightly.  Looks like a lighthouse in a darkened bathroom at night!</li>
            <li> I like it  much better than Sonicare, which I had been using for many years.&lt;br /&gt;It fits over and around each tooth and probably does a better job.  It&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;pleasant to use, too.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush itself has, thus far, been excellent. Unfortunately, the picture clearly shows that it comes with the stand/brush head case. This is misleading. The package only contains the charger and toothbrush itself. I wouldn&#x27;t mind this so much, were there anywhere on the page where it said what comes in the package. Sadly, Oral B neglected to put this minimal amount of effort in. Were this properly addressed, or their page amended to be accurate, I would gladly give this five stars.</li>
            <li> First, I would like to say that the stand in the picture is not the stand you receive. You only get the charger, no brush head holder. I was really looking forward to that brush head holder, but since the brush has been delivered I was able to undergo all of the stages of grief and finally have come to accept that I wont be able to proudly display my brush heads next to the charger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Onto the brush itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is everything that I expected and more! Plugged it in, charged it up, and took it for a spin through my oral cavity. As per the instructions, and my knowledge from being a semi-regular tooth brusher, I took 30 seconds per quadrant. the vibrations in between quadrants kept me on a terrific pace. By the time everything was said and done my teeth felt like I had just left the dentist (without the awkward hands in the mouth conversation).  5 STARS!!!</li>
            <li> Works great.  I need to charge weekly but I brush at least 4 minutes twice a day.</li>
            <li> There is nothing like a good electric toothbrush, and this is one of them. Within days, my teeth look whiter and healthier. I will never go back to a manual toothbrush. I got this at a great price too. Do your mouth and your health a favor and buy this. Also, don&#x27;t buy cheap brush replacements. buy the Oral-B ones.</li>
            <li> I purchased this electric toothbrush a month ago and absolutely love it.!  I have never owned an electric toothbrush before.  I use it everyday and it works!  My teeth feel amazing when done.</li>
            <li> Happy with the tooth brush but it really should have come with a travel case.</li>
            <li> We love our Oral-B toothbrushes.  Our dental reviews are a testament to their effectiveness.</li>
            <li> I love this Professional line, rechargeable toothbrush. My old one died after several yrs and needed a new one. This is far better as it has a 2 minute timer with vibrational queues so each quadrant is cleaned; a sensor to let you know if you&#x27;re brushing too hard; smaller charging base. I highly recommend this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> make sure you have a 110v outlet (for international buyers) this is the same quality as the old one, and works with the same brushes, it is a well built piece of equipment</li>
            <li> Love this electric toothbrush!  I already had one and when my 12 yr. old son needed his toothbrush replace, we decided to get him an Oral B, too.  He loves how clean his teeth feel.  It&#x27;s easy to care for, and does an excellent job cleaning ... the dentist even commented on how impressed he was.  I would recommend this to everyone!</li>
            <li> I bought this brush after my old Oral-B went to Tooth Fairy heaven. Have used it for 3 weeks now and does what I wanted an electric tooth brush to do. Brush teeth. I didn&#x27;t want a digital read out or one that connects to the internet and plays music etc etc.(LOL). I wanted just a plain electric toothbrush for a resonable price. This was it. It does have the 30 second alert, which I did like in my old one. It comes with a simple stand recharger that fits in the corner of the counter top.  My previous Oral-B lasted 8 years, so I&#x27;ll be tickled if this one does also. With the rebate, it cost $40.00, right up my alley.&lt;br /&gt;  They make a good product in my opinion. I&#x27;d recommend the Oral-B 1000 if your needs are basic.</li>
            <li> I received this product as part of Amazon&#x27;s Vine Voice program. I say this because I&#x27;ve never really been keen on spending nearly fifty dollars for a toothbrush, regardless of how \\&quot;professional\\&quot; it is or whatever \\&quot;precision\\&quot; it can claim to have. Raised in a struggling home, I was always taught that a little elbow grease can more than make up for a lot of what you lack otherwise. \\&quot;I got a professional electric toothbrush,\\&quot; I told my dad. \\&quot;Yeah?\\&quot; he said. \\&quot;Why don&#x27;t you just brush a little harder with the regular kind?\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This toothbrush does everything that it claims to. My teeth felt sparkling clean after most uses, although I found that the heads seemed to fray and wear out a bit faster than the product claimed they would. Also I have a fairly large mouth with fairly large teeth, and the tiny heads on this thing made it feel like I was brushing with a bundle of soft toothpicks. I suppose that&#x27;s where the \\&quot;precision\\&quot; comes into play -- it was far easier to get in all the crevices and corners than with a standard toothbrush -- but it also meant I found myself more than once clanging the plastic edge of the head against my enamel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The charge also seems to take awhile, although this is an issue that I had mainly because my bathroom doesn&#x27;t really have any outlets, so I had to charge the toothbrush in a separate room. Leaving it in the bathroom meant that it ran out of juice faster than normal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a good product, does what it claims, and when used as directed, it might be worth the expense for those who can&#x27;t seem to get a good, thorough cleaning with those old-fashioned manual models. People with teeth the size of [[ASIN:B0015DAEHK Chiclets]], though, might want to look elsewhere.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush met up with all my expectations.  I&#x27;ve bought 2 other ones over the past two years and this one is no disappointment!</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush. Stays charged for days.</li>
            <li> good product, arrived quickly, would recommend</li>
            <li> This is the best deal I could find anywhere for this electric toothbrush. I love the compact base and the cleaning power of the brush. The programmed &#x27;timer&#x27; alerts you every 30 seconds, so you can brush areas of your mouth thoroughly without thinking about it.</li>
            <li> My wife and I have used these for years and have had excellent service from them. They do an excellent job cleaning teeth.</li>
            <li> She loves it ! Easy to use, pauses when it&#x27;s time to change to the next quadrant, ensuring all areas get brushed ! Keeps it&#x27;s charge for ~6-7 days before needing to be recharged. Has lights indicating &amp;#34;charge&amp;#34; so she knows when to place it on its base to recharge. Great starter electric toothbrush for anyone. I bought the 5000 model for myself and while the 5000 model has a few more features including the display unit ( which never worked properly for me so I don&#x27;t even use it )  I should have just saved on $ and bought this one because the 1000 is just as efficient! The 1000 model just doesn&#x27;t come with the display unit or the travel case.</li>
            <li> This was my first time using an electric toothbrush, so I might be biased...:) ...but I really love it! It is leagues better than using a standard toothbrush. My teeth feel much cleaner after using this, and the charge lasts for a long time before I have to recharge. Because you&#x27;re supposed to only charge the brush when it tells you the battery is low, I have a standard toothbrush on &amp;#34;standby&amp;#34; for the one day it needs to charge fully. I haven&#x27;t kept track exactly, but it appears to only need a recharge every few weeks.</li>
            <li> The initial charge lasted 10 days, the second seven and the subsequent ones only three or four days. I missed my window to return it to Amazon by two days so I have to send it back to Braun on my dime. They&#x27;ll replace/repair it and send it back w/in 15 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The toothbrush itself worked well - when it wasn&#x27;t charging! Hopefully I just got a lemon and the replacement will hold a charge. I&#x27;ll update this review when I&#x27;ve had some experience with the new one.</li>
            <li> It works as promissed. Battery lasts for a long time before you need to recharge it again, around a week or so.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush does a good job of cleaning however, it takes a long time (approx. 17-18 hours) to recharge and the charge lasts only about 20 minutes (4 or 5 days of brushing).  The reminder pause that occurs every 30 seconds is a little irritating.</li>
            <li> Good quality, durable, does a good job cleaning teeth. No complaints or problems. I like that replacement brushes are easy to find and the model does not become obsolete.</li>
            <li> This product was given to me as a present. I was happy to get a new electric toothbrush at first but before I opened it I did a quick search online to read reviews and decided to return it because it only supports 110-130 V power supply and I need something that travels well and can go to international voltages like 220 V. I think the old models were dual voltage. I&#x27;m sad to send it back but I don&#x27;t want a toothbrush I can&#x27;t take with me for more than a few days before the battery dies.</li>
            <li> Love it, works so well and whitens my teeth.  after using i feel like i just had my teeth cleaned by the dentist.  And also, the battery can last with regular use for about a week without charging</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend the Oral-B Pro Healthy Clean Precision 1000, this is an awesome toothbrush. Last about 5 days of two a day brushing on single charge.</li>
            <li> While I&#x27;ve only been using it for a few weeks, my family and I LOVE this thing.  I bought the brushes for sensitive gums and am glad I did.  Our teeth are squeeky clean after using this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a Christmas gift for my husband, he has used it for about 5 months and loves it. I would recommend this to friends</li>
            <li> The 3D brush head works great. I get much better removal of tartar with this electric toothbrush than by hand brushing. Definitely worth the money for improved gum health. Note that the cheapest model that can use a 3D brush head works just as well as the most expensive model, which just has a few more bells and whistles on the timer and display. No need to buy the more expensive toothbrush. But, the base is poorly designed. Even though I wash the brush after use, toothpaste deposits build up on the top of the charging unit and these smell after a week or two. I have to keep washing the charger unit. The battery doesn&#x27;t charge well after about 2 years, and youll have to replace the unit. The new oner will seem much stronger as it will hold a good charge. Also, on two different occasions I bought an oral B electric tooth brush and submitted my receipt to Braun, who promised a $20 refund. On both occasions, I never heard back from them--what a scam.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush arrived 2 days after I ordered it.  The usual brilliant Amazon service.&lt;br /&gt;And I am very pleased with it the brush itself  It is the most comfortable electric toothbrush I have used as it is no struggle to get around the back teeth.&lt;br /&gt;Light and easy to hold.  It&#x60;s tempting to keep on brushing after the 2 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;So my teeth have never felt cleaner.</li>
            <li> I purchased this to replace an earlier Oral-B model than stopped charging. I thought my old one was good, but this one is the best. Does a great job and feels good on the gums.</li>
            <li> I tried the Oral B after my Sonicare died, but it doesn&#x27;t leave my mouth feeling as clean as the Sonicare did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason the Sonicare died is that I tend to apply pressure while brushing, and the rotating shaft develops a wobble because of the pressure wearing out whatever surrounds the shaft inside the unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going back to Sonicare.</li>
            <li> Ok, first the caveats. I am an Oral-B user for over 20 years. And, believe it or not, my original Oral-B just recently died after over 20 YEARS use twice a day by 2 people. (connector at head attachment developed a crack, still works but has a buzz and not as strong brushing). I purchased this unit as a replacement (I purchased TWO replacements, diff models, will comment on other in different review).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This replacement for my original is a bit slimmer but same basic specs and we use the precision heads which are getting harder and harder to find. Works well but lacks the Brush holder assemply we loved on me original Oral-B 40.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, works as well and highly recommended for first-timers though I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;ll get 20 years of use out of this model. They&#x27;re not making them like they used to , to last forever, but is probably still the best quality you can get out of an electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Very good massage for the gums and good cleaning power. Battery charge lasts at least a week; doing one brushing a day. It came well protected and charged the battery quickly.</li>
            <li> I had a Oral-B Triumph rechargeable electric toothbrush for over 10 years. This one has all the power I need &amp; I hope to have it for several years too!</li>
            <li> I so love mine and get better checkups so I buy these for birthday gifts and the recipients love it and greatly appreciate it</li>
            <li> I had used the first version of the Oral B electric cleaner and this is a nice improvement.  It still offers the power to do a good cleaning but now is much quieter and has new features that make it a better product, such as the charge indicator built into the handle.  It also seems to charge more quickly than the older model and performance stays better throughout the charing cycle.</li>
            <li> The Oral-B works as promised and my teeth feel as clean as they ever had after brushing.  My dentist recommended an electric toothbrush and I am glad I got this one.</li>
            <li> My son is sensitive to vibration and he tolerates and loves this brush. Gets his teeth clean without much effort. Great product!</li>
            <li> I had an Oral B for 10 years before it died. I used it everyday, 2 times a day.  I never had an cavities while using this brush.  When my first one died, tried a few others for about 6 months, I had 2 cavities during that time.  So, I went back to Oral B about 2 years ago and no more cavities! I love the timer that alerts you every 30 seconds, it keep me from brushing the same spot when I am daydreaming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only recommendation, make one that play music.  Brushing your teeth gets boring.</li>
            <li> I visit my dentist less often for cleanings, thanks to this brush.  Far superior tooth cleaning than the Sonicare I was using previously.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this product. Exactly as described and delivery was prompt.</li>
            <li> My previous Barun Oral-B lasted about 9.7 years and only started to go bad after maybe 9.3, I guess.  It was very nice.  However this one is smaller, lighter, with more features and more enjoyable to use.  I am very impressed.  I have used a little bracket and some Velcro loop&amp;hook material and now my new &amp;#34;Dental Friend&amp;#34; (this Product) is within easy reach and safe above the Lavatory Sink.</li>
            <li> So far it works, but I hate the fact that this one is longer than the two older ones I had because now it doesn&#x27;t fit upright on the shelf where I kept the others. I also hate the fact that every time I go to try and put the brush on, I always end up holding the darn thing backwards as that&#x27;s what feels more natural and it&#x27;s the wrong way. The old buttons where better in terms of size and feel. As for the timer, well I think it&#x27;s useless, but not annoying enough to worry about, I just keep brushing away so if they take that feature out I won&#x27;t miss it. I also don&#x27;t care for that blinking light...just another thing lighting up.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t work like we thought it would.</li>
            <li> Effect is good, very like</li>
            <li> My dentist requested that I purchase ONLY this brand. After resisting I now feel foolish as this product works very well. It only needs charging (for me) every 10 days and charges quickly after that first full charge. It such a great job that I bought more for the rest of the family.</li>
            <li> I have had an Oral B electric toothbrush for many years and have loved it.  This one is a replacement as the other wore out and it is just as good as the one I had for over 10 years with several new features.</li>
            <li> Great product, love it.</li>
            <li> So much higher power than the cheap electrics I grew up using. It pulses(momentarily stops and starts) every thirty seconds, which I find useful because I often didn&#x27;t spend long enough before. Battery holds charge a good long time. There are cheap generic brush head replacements available. Haven&#x27;t found anything to complain about.</li>
            <li> Works great, and the price was beyond amazing for the quality of this product, especially compared to other options! Thanks.</li>
            <li> 220V charging can be directly used in China, it can not converter, personally tested. Bold charge it!</li>
            <li> Works much better than those battery operated brushes.  2 minutes and your mouth feels extremely clean.</li>
            <li> I like it, but I don&#x27;t like the round headed brush as well as I liked the rectangular headed Oral B that this one replaced.  I didn&#x27;t think about it when I ordered it, but my next one will definitely have rectangular headed brushes.  These are hard to fit into the back of my mouth to reach the upper back teeth.</li>
            <li> I have been using Oral b toothbrush for many years.  It&#x27;s very quiet when using this toothbrush daily.  I still don&#x27;t know why I still have cavity.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had Oral-B for years.  It cleans your teeth and leaves them feeling smooth and looking polished.  The new timiing device is perfect for brushing each quadrant and prevents one from over-brushing.  I recommend it to all.</li>
            <li> After using 2 great expensive toothbrushes for 10 years (recommended by my orthodontist), I was quite hesitent to try my husband&#x27;s suggestion and purchase an &#x27;Oral-B Professional Healthy Clean Precision 1000 Rechargeable Electric&#x27; when mine died.  Did not think I needed or would like the timer which seemed to come with most of them but find it is a terrific asset for someone like myself who seems to always have 200 things on my mind. Every 30 seconds, for 2 minutes, it nudges me back to the job at hand &amp; when I am done I know I have spent about 30 seconds on each quadrant no matter how I chose to break up the quadrants for that particular session.  Hubby was right again.[[ASIN:B003UKM9CO Oral-B Professional Healthy Clean Precision 1000 Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush 1 Count]]</li>
            <li> This is a powerful toothbrush and I love the timer.  It helps you make sure you get all 4 quadrants for 30 seconds each.</li>
            <li> Had an Oral B first for a few years, then changed to Sonicare.  When the Sonicare finally died we went back to Oral B.  Glad we did as it is MUCH better in my opinion.  My husband likes it much better also.</li>
            <li> The reason for purchasing this toothbrush is that dentist recommend a circular brush action which my old brush did not have.  It&#x27;s a bit noisy. I haven&#x27;t had all that long and hope it holds us as well as my old one. Can&#x27;t beat the price for this product.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with item and time of shipment.  It definitely meets my needs and performs up to my expectations. I would recommend this item.</li>
            <li> It is a better and faster replacement for the previous model and, conveniently, the brush heads fit both.&lt;br /&gt;After one minute of brushing, there is a pause which is annoying.  Otherwise, it&#x27;s a good, basic toothbrush.</li>
            <li> this was a replacement product as my old one died. my dental check-ups have been great since using this. arrived as ordered.</li>
            <li> I like the toothbrush because it is slim (does not take a lot of space on the bathroom counter) but it is a lot noisier than other electric toothbrush I&#x27;ve own.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a Christmas gift for my daughter.  She loves it so much that I have to limit her to only using it twice a day!!</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush.  It leaves your teeth feeling very clean and smooth.  Be sure to check the Oral-B website for any rebates. I got a $15 rebate on this.</li>
            <li> Up until now, the toothbrush has performed well.  About a year ago the battery started to loose it&#x27;s ability to hold a charge for long.  I would only get a couple of uses out of it before it needed to be charged.  So even on short trips I was forced to bring the charger.  A couple of days ago, the toothbrush stopped altogether, presumably the battery is dead.  As a premium product I would have expected the product to last longer, I also contacted P&amp;G about this, and here is their response in it&#x27;s entirety.  Perhaps they should let consumers know that there is a planned obsolescence, or longevity (or in this case short-evity) built into their products.  Great selling feature, they should put this right on the package!!!!  Who would ever buy this, knowing that it was expected to fail in 3-5 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Thank you for contacting Oral-B, Ron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’m very sorry that your toothbrush is no longer working properly. Please be assured that I would be sharing your experience with the rest of my quality team. Our toothbrush handles are meant to last 3-5 years. If you had your toothbrush around that time, it would be time to replace the entire unit. Most likely is the battery that is has reached the end of its useful life time and the battery cannot be replaced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since your satisfaction means a great deal to us, I’m also sending a money saving coupon that would be good towards your next purchase of an Oral-B rechargeable toothbrush. You should receive my letter within the next 2-3 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for taking the time to write!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great. Works well and holds charge for a long time.</li>
            <li> I have used Sonicare and Oral B&#x27;s Pulsonic.  Compared with them, this one seems a little noisier, but not terrible.  It takes about 24 hours to charge and recharge which seems long, but not terrible.  The motion of the brush head is comfortable even on my sensitive teeth although it seems clumsily large, and only my next checkup will tell how effective it is in cleaning my teeth. I love that it flashes red when it needs recharging and hope that this format will help it last longer than the two years my Pulsonic did.  I also like the slim, lightweight handle and very compact charging base.  I have only used it for two weeks and may want to give it five stars later!</li>
            <li> This toothbrush replaced an older model which succumbed to time.  It gets my teeth cleaner than the old model did.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had several electric toothbrushes but, I like this one.  I like the smaller base and it does a good job</li>
            <li> I really like that after 30 seconds it has a different vibration so I can spend 30 seconds on each fourth of my mouth.</li>
            <li> My dentist suggested that I use an electric toothbrush to reduce tartar on my teeth that is seen during routine cleaning.  It took more than 24 hours to charge the first time, but shorter times since then.  My teeth feel very clean after using it.  It is a fairly basic and relatively inexpensive electric toothbrush, which cleans with a rapidly rotating brush; no ultrasonic cleaning you get with more expensive electric toothbrushes.  If you press too hard, the brush simply stops rotating.</li>
            <li> I gave this to my kids and they love it and i love the way their teeth look too! lol</li>
            <li> Very simple to use.  Has a two minute timer, 30 intervals.  Stays charged for at least a week.  Like the small charger.</li>
            <li> It meets my expectation. It would be perfect if the brush head is bigger. This is a good product with good price.</li>
            <li> It so far is working well, as I was hoping.&lt;br /&gt;  Aubrey Stone</li>
            <li> Easy to use - just plug and go. This is the first time I am using an electric toothbrush and I have no regrets. It feels like you just got back from the dentist.</li>
            <li> Have been using this for a few months. I love it! Does a great job with little effort. I wish it would come with two brush heads instead of just one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this brush for over a year and it continues to perform great. When and if this wears out I&#x27;ll buy another one just like it.</li>
            <li> Althought the brush head is small it feels as if it is targetting every tooth. The only downside is that the rotation tends to stop a second if too much pressure is put on the brush.</li>
            <li> Awesome brush!  This is an extremely good brush that is comparable to some of the equipment in my dentist&#x27;s office. Leaves your teeth feeling polished and clean, this brush has an automatic timer that lets you know when to stop brushing. A great brush!</li>
            <li> Brought to replace a older Oral-B toothbrush.  I liked the other model I had before better. It had a place on the recharger stand to store the brushes and also came with more then on brush. Still waiting for a rebate for Oral-B. I called them and there was no record of me mailing in all the information. I always have a problem with rebates, I think it is just a gimmick to get you to buy their product and then never mail you your money.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good. my first electronic toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;But I didn&#x27;t get the rebate till now. Hope I can get it .</li>
            <li> The electris toothbrush with the little round brush really works great.  I know my teeth feel much cleaner, than when I brush with&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;a regular manual toothbrush..  I almost enjoy brushing, almost.</li>
            <li> I had an old oral b toothbrush. Mine was a lower quality than this one and I am glad I replaced it.</li>
            <li> It is my second Oral-B,even better than my first.Like the smaller charging station and the low battery indicator. Good purchase.</li>
            <li> I was really hoping to take before and after pictures to see how effective this toothbrush was, but after a busy week I can already tell they are much whiter than they were before. I had previously been using a cheap disposable electric toothbrush from Wal-Mart &amp;#34;Equate.&amp;#34; It seemed to do an okay job, and at least better than what a regular toothbrush could do for me. The last time I had an Oral-B brush was about 10 years ago, when I was 15. It was a $30 model, and it seemed to work well for me. After it was lost, I have been using cheapo toothbrushes ever since. Over the past several years, I have had excess plaque and sensitive gums on every 6mo checkup at the dentist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first thing I noticed when I turned the brush on and started to use it, was that the bristles were very hard compared to what I had been using. I have used hard bristle toothbrushes in the past, but this one seemed much harder. The first few days my gums bled, but now after a week they no longer bleed and there is definitely no buildup hiding at my gum-lines. I am extremely happy with this toothbrush and will be buying another for my significant other. I feel like I have just left the dentist after using this, along with my oroburush, (tongue brush/scraper) floss and mouth wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This toothbrush is so good, it deserves 10 out of 5!</li>
            <li> I got this when there was a $25 mail in rebate so it was totally worth it. I switched to this electric toothbrush and my teeth are so much cleaner. I feel like this is a great model because you&#x27;re not paying for all the bells and whistles that you don&#x27;t really need. The only downside is the name brand replacement heads are ridiculously expensive and the off-brand ones I found at Target that are supposed to work with it are a very tight and awkward fit. I will probably just have to spring for the actual Oral-B replacement heads next time. That being said- you don&#x27;t have to replace the head very often, for me they last well over a month.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had quite a few electric toothbrushes for years.  This one is the best, and I couldn&#x27;t believe it lasted 16 days on a single charge.  No need to carry the charger on trips of 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> my wife loves that it recharges and has that extra oomph every time she uses it. Says her smile looks brighter and her teeth feel cleaner.</li>
            <li> I just started using this.  We&#x27;ll see the results when I visit the dentist in 2 mos.  I hope I am &amp;#34;brushing&amp;#34; correctly.</li>
            <li> This is a replacement for  a 7 year old model.  Works fine as expected.</li>
            <li> Wonderful!  I was somewhat apprehensive about choosing the &amp;#34;right&amp;#34; toothbrush.  This one is simple, easy to keep clean, and does a great job.  It feels like a very pleasant massage on one&#x27;s teeth and gums.  I was not at all sure I would want the 30 second brief pause that encourages the user to move on to the next area, but I have found it very helpful and quite unobtrusive in completing an even 2 minutes.  My old Oral-B electric toothbrush had put in very long service, and was gradually slowing down; I&#x27;d lost track of how terrific one of these brushes could be.  This model makes brushing teeth much more enjoyable.  Strongly recommended.</li>
            <li> It works great and very strong. I like the timer built in.</li>
            <li> I gave these as a gift and my friend thought it was very powerful for a toothbrush, said she liked that</li>
            <li> WOW People treat yourself to an electric toothbrush. We may think we get all those nooks and crannies but we seem to miss them with the traditional way of brushing manually. It saves on cost of dental work later on.</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s not to like.  Just works.  Excellent product.  Have been using Braun electric toothbrushes for decades.</li>
            <li> worked great never going back to a regular tooth brush</li>
            <li> A great brush and would recommend AAAAAAAAAAAA++++++++++</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple weeks and it works great.  Made my teeth feel squeaky clean.  I highly recommend the Oral-B Professional Care 1000 Electric Toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I have the Sonicare and didn&#x27;t like how gunk would go into the brush head requiring considerable cleaning weekly.  This brush feels more like a hygienist&#x27;s appliance and allows your teeth to feel well cleaned.  According to my hygienist, my Sonicare didn&#x27;t clean as well either.  I&#x27;m looking forward to my next dental visit to see if the professionals can see the difference with this switch.  Appears to be well worth the price especially with the mail in coupon.  The only weakness that I&#x27;ve noted thus far is the lack of a brush head cover.</li>
            <li> I like this product. I suggest patience while the unit is doing its initial charging of the internal battery. It took mine about 36 hours until the blinking light (showing that unit is charging) went off. After calling the help line I was told sometimes this happens so if yours doesn&#x27;t go off after a few hours don&#x27;t be alarmed. Just give it more time. As others have written this Model 1000 does a fine job of cleaning my teeth. Customer support of this product is excellent and helpful which is rare these days.</li>
            <li> Feels good on the gums, not sure if it&#x27;s making anything better or worse.</li>
            <li> Good. But a bit too quick. Wish it had a slower speed also.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t beat Oral-B products.</li>
            <li> I have one which I like so I gave this one as a gift to my son.</li>
            <li> **EDIT March 2014**&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After one and a half years, the battery seems to be getting worse over time. Despite following the charging instructions and recommendations provided by the manufacturer, there seems to be a disconnect between the battery indicating \\&quot;low\\&quot; vs. the battery depletion time. After the last few charging cycles, I have noticed that the unit will not indicate that the battery is low and needs to be recharged. However, the next brushing cycle will abruptly end after about a minute and THEN indicates that the battery is low and must be charged. Pressing the power button will not turn the unit back on. Hence, I now have to feel out when the battery may be getting low or just charge it every day, rather than once a week or when the unit indicates a low battery. Technically, it is still under warranty, but the shipping cost is on me, making it more worthwhile to just continue using the product as-is or buy a newer model. I am still somewhat happy with the unit, but I will definitely keep this in mind when buying another electric toothbrush in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--Previous review--&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used a manual toothbrush for at least the past 10 years, but was looking for a cheap and effective electric one, since I always read about the benefits of them. After using this one, I would be happy to recommend this to others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Positive:&lt;br /&gt;-Good size&lt;br /&gt;-Mouth feels very clean after use&lt;br /&gt;-Replacement heads are available from both the company and generic (so hidden cost of the heads can be reduced if you shop around)&lt;br /&gt;-Different heads available for purchase&lt;br /&gt;-A single charge lasts about a week when brushing 2x per day&lt;br /&gt;-Built-in timer w/ vibration helps gauge how long you&#x27;ve been brushing&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Negative:&lt;br /&gt;-Wish it would charge a little faster. Minor complaint, but if I brush at 7AM and get the low battery warning, I plug it in. Indicator still shows charging even if I wait until 11PM that night, and I like to let it charge fully, so I use a manual toothbrush for that session until the following morning, and then it is fully charged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Final verdict: a good electric toothbrush at a reasonable price. If you&#x27;re not looking to buy the top-end products at top-end prices, but want to see what electric toothbrushes are all about, try this one out.let it charge fully, so I use a manual toothbrush for that session until the following morning, and then it is fully charged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Final verdict: a good electric toothbrush at a reasonable price.

            <li> Good quality and efficient</li>
            <li> Works as well as all the Oral-B toothbrushes I&#x27;ve used in the past. They&#x27;re pretty consistent in quality.</li>
            <li> I started with an Oral-B toothbrush, then bought a Sonicare.  I&#x27;m back to Oral-B.  First and foremost, the Oral-B brush is a solid piece, not the contraption Sonicare sells that allows stinky mold and bacteria to proliferate at the brush base and beneath the cone where it screws into the base.  The Sonicare cleaning action was fine; it was the unsanitary design, the really nasty smell, the need to take the brush assembly apart at least every week and figure out a way to swab out all that gunk under it without corroding the metal parts that was so off-putting.  The Oral-B brush, on the other hand, has one connecting point and a ring that seals very well.  The price of the brushes is another win for Oral-B...at least $4 cheaper than Sonicare per brush.  The vibration of the Oral-B is a bit noisier and there&#x27;s more of it.  But who cares?  It cleans well, cleans up easily and is a much cheaper way to get the job done. Because it&#x27;s slimmer, I find it much easier to navigate around my mouth and keep the base dry as well.</li>
            <li> It works well and is comfortable to use. I wish it were a bit more powerful (more rotations per minute) but for $40 it&#x27;s a decent buy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve just upgraded from the $20 version of the Oral B Rechargeable Electric toothbrush. I didn&#x27;t think I would care that I get a reminder to change quandrants, but it is really helpful. What is the best thing about this toothbrush is that I don&#x27;t need to leave it plugged in. The $20 version would not let you know that it was going to die, it would just die in the middle of a brushing. I simply left it plugged in all the time. The 1000 will flash red to let you know that it needs to be recharged. Awesome. It flashes red when I&#x27;m done brushing. I plug it in. The next time I brush my teeth I unplug it. A charge lasts several days. I like the brushing action. My teeth feel great. I use a sensitive brush and my teeth feel clean and there is no pain.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s awesome compared to a manual brush. i don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s just my toothbrush but I can tell when it has full battery (rotations are a bit aggressive) and when it&#x27;s about to die (not just by the flashing red light either). that&#x27;s gotta be a malfunction or something. consistency is hard to achieve.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m really glad I chose the upgrade &amp;#34;professional&amp;#34; compared to the &amp;#34;vitality&amp;#34; ($15 price difference) because although I&#x27;m sure it doesn&#x27;t cost the manufacturer to make it pause, the pause every 30 seconds helps me remember to switch quadrants. although honestly I&#x27;ve stopped heading the suggestions and give myself a pat on the back if i even make it to the 2 minute 4x &#x27;job well done&#x27; pauses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the flashing green is kinda confusing- it means its charging i think although instictually i&#x27;d think flashing green means it&#x27;s finished charging and a constant green means &amp;#34;wait. gimme a sec&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;if someone from Oral B is reading this, please give me more coupons for the heads. I can&#x27;t pay full price, I&#x27;ll never admit that I need to change the head, they&#x27;re so expensive. ($30/3pack)</li>
            <li> Good tooth brush. Bought it to replace an earlier one.</li>
            <li> This is my first electric toothbrush so unfortunately I don&#x27;t have anything to compare it to, but I will say that I am pleasantly surprised by how well it works. Wish I bought this long ago. My teeth feel noticeably cleaner after brushing (compared to a standard toothbrush), and I find it works especially well to clean in the hard to reach area behind molars. Happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I love it. It makes my teeth feel extra clean and is easy to use. The charge lasts for a long time so short trips can easily be done without the charger. No complaints.</li>
            <li> Works great...cleaner teeth!</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t come with a holder for the toothbrush, the way that all of the other OralB electric toothbrushes came.  Without being able to remove the toothbrush, the unit is too tall to fit into a typical bathroom cabinet shelf, unless you rearrange the shelves and everything on them.  You can just remove the head, but putting it on the shelf or counter isn&#x27;t a good solution, both for germs, and to allow the head to dry out between uses.  I contacted OralB Customer Care and four days later, their solution was a link for me to buy a $13 toothbrush head holder that from the picture is not attached to the base.  All I wanted was the simple snap-on base that came with the last one I ordered -- it can&#x27;t cost more than a few pennies, but it does the trick.  I am in the process of calling the 800 number that Customer Care referred me to; so for, it is inoperable.  I&#x27;m not a happy camper.</li>
            <li> Just as described. Easy to use.</li>
            <li> Great price,  cheapest that I found.  This was half the cost of my local stores.  There was a $15.00 mail in rebate in addition.  My fault that I lost the proof of purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Works great.  Dentist has been recommending one for years.  I tried the battery powered one a few years ago and tossed in quickly.  Hoping for less time in the dental chair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fast delivery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Downside is that I didn&#x27;t research the cost of replacement heads,  which can  be  $7-8 each.  Looking for the attachment that will hold alternative heads on the charger unit.  Would like to be able to switch heads so that my husband can use the same unit (different head).  Haven&#x27;t found any models that are &amp;#34;family&amp;#34; friendly.</li>
            <li> Gives a nice thorough cleaning!  My teeth feel so good every time I brush.  I highly recommend this product.  Does the job, yet the price is right.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using cheap electric toothbrushes for years, and finally switched to this mid-rage model.  It leaves my teeth feeling delightfully clean, and the timer feature works great.  I&#x27;ll never go back!</li>
            <li> Works well. Simple. Quick delivery. NO complaints.&lt;br /&gt;My old one lasted forever. Hope the same for this one.&lt;br /&gt;I like the way it has the time reminder.</li>
            <li> My wife and I love our new electric toothbrushes.  My teeth always feel much cleaner now and my gums feel stronger. Great Price and free shipping to boot.</li>
            <li> Great product, great price.  It makes my teeth feel great and I know that it is keeping my gums healthy.</li>
            <li> i would say i like it. it is good for this price. though you may get a much better one with 200+ dollars</li>
            <li> I owned the Oral B Professional Care 5000 series for years and it finally died...it had a lot of features on it that i never used (like different speed settings)so i think this one is perfect for me. and the price is awesome.  works great for me and my husband.</li>
            <li> Very good item,&lt;br /&gt;still like it a lot and would buy it again&lt;br /&gt;Hope you will enjoy it, as well!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this brush for a couple of weeks now, and I love it. It gets my teeth WAY cleaner than the battery-powered brushes I had been using, and getting it on Amazon was way cheaper than getting it anywhere else. I haven&#x27;t replaced the brushes yet, which I hear is the most expensive lifetime cost of a brush like this, but for now I&#x27;m totally satisfied.</li>
            <li> I only use it when I cannot clean some spots which are hard to reach using normal toothbrushes. So far it works OK. The battery life increases after charging for a couple of times.</li>
            <li> I like this toothbrush, and would have given it 5 stars if it had a &amp;#34;floss action&amp;#34; brush head.  I feel the cleaning action is better with the floss action brush.  I haven&#x27;t been able to find the floss action replacement heads in the stores.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this toothbrush! Read a few articles and studies which stated that there&#x27;s no true advantage between an electric toothbrush versus a solid clean with your manual brush. I completely disagree! I concur with most of the reviews I found, about no need for any further bells and whistles. Simple, does an amazing job and the price is perfect!</li>
            <li> It cleans very well.  My only complaint is that the battery can not be easily replaced and the battery lasts about 2 years.</li>
            <li> I bought it in August 2011. It is fine to use when the battery works.&lt;br /&gt;But, now the battery died, and it cannot be used anymore.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush works great. I ordered it during a discount sale for a great price and value.</li>
            <li> I have been using Braun Oral B for years but they eventually wear out</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product and would recommend it to others.  It does not take up a lot of counter space</li>
            <li> Batteries on these do not last forever. This was an excellent replacement for an older Oral-B unit. Biggest drawback is that there does not seem to be a travel case available. My older unit had a plastic travel case.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for the price after my dentist office recomended using an electric toothbrush. One of the reviews said if you don&#x27;t need all the bells and wistles, the Oral-B 1000 would work great and it does. I charge i once a week. My teeth feel great. It encourages me to brush longer. I&#x27;m looking forward to my next checkup.</li>
            <li> This is my first electric toothbrush and after a few days I can tell that it will get my teeth much cleaner than a regular brush.&lt;br /&gt;This model seems to have good battery life, at least initially.  I have used it several times in a week and I have not had to recharge it.  (I&#x27;m going to try to drain the battery all the way before recharging, to avoid the &amp;#34;memory&amp;#34; effect).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, the stutter feature is really, really annoying.  And AFAIK there is absolutely no way to disable it.  For those who didn&#x27;t know, after 30 seconds it pauses once for 1 second, after 60 seconds it pauses twice, and after 2 min it pauses 3 times.. or something like that.  I don&#x27;t brush for a set length of time, I carefully get each side of each tooth.  So I do not need any timer feature, and the stuttering is just really, really annoying.  I wish it could just beep or have an LED light up or something.</li>
            <li> Love the item and the circular rotation on the brush. Keeps my teeth much cleaner than standard brushing</li>
            <li> The Oral-B Professional Healthy Clean Precision 1000 Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush is the best there is on the market. And for the price amazon is offering, no one can pass on this opportunity. So for anyone who wants a healthy set of teethes/gums (at the same time at great price) I would highly recommend in purchasing this today.</li>
            <li> I definitely noticed that the rotating brush was an improvement on my older Oral-B but it was a little too harsh on some of my gum tissues so I had to order the Sensitive toothbrush replacements.  Now I have to switch out the brushes for sensitive areas and tougher areas like my built in retainer and tongue.  Kind of a pain.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush itself is great, but I&#x27;ve bought two of these so far and both times the charger has died within 6 months.</li>
            <li> My dentist told me my plaque was building up and  typicall brushing was not working. I found a great deal on this product and love the purchase. It is important to use for 2 minutes, but for the price the quality is great and my teeth are much cleaner with less plaque.</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush.  Let me tell you why.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It keeps you honest.  30 seconds per quadrant!!!  Two minutes!!  It actually works great if you&#x27;re in a hurry and can&#x27;t spare two minutes.  Thirty seconds with this is better than thirty seconds by hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The battery life is reasonable.  I use one charger for mine and my wife&#x27;s toothbrush and I don&#x27;t have to keep the charger plugged in all the time.  That&#x27;s right.  I liked this toothbrush so much that I bought another one for my wife.  No offense honey. I didn&#x27;t mean to imply anything....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a wide assortment of heads available as this toothbrush works with the full line of oral b heads.  We tried a cheaper generic store version of brush heads but were so unimpressed that we ordered the oral b floss action heads within a week.  We were much more satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price is great.  The nearest retail stores have this same brush for $20 more.  It doesn&#x27;t have all the bells and whistles that some people may be looking for, but it has everything a good toothbrush should.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great upgrade from those cheap AA battery powered toothbrushes and couldn&#x27;t come more highly recommended.  Happy brushing.</li>
            <li> i like thie item very much because it&#x27;s really easy for me to use</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush!  Would purchase again.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace a less expensive Oral-B electric toothbrush that someone accidentally broke. This one has more power and suits me just fine. I&#x27;ve tried other brands, but plan to stay with this one because I really like the way the toothbrush head cups each tooth. For me, this makes thorough cleaning much easier than when using a toothbrush with an oval head.</li>
            <li> The first time I went to my dentist, I hadn&#x27;t been to one in well over a year. She was SHOCKED that I had almost NO PLAQUE! Her mind was kinda blown. I was using my favorite Sonicare toothbrush and flossing daily back then. I was using a Sonicare for pretty much the last 10+ years. My dentisit told me to switch to this Oral-B series because it&#x27;s &amp;#34;softer&amp;#34; on my gums. I guess the regular heads on the regular Sonicare can wear away the enamel on your teeth over time and make your gums recede. Fine, I switched.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So fast forward to every single dental visit since I switched to this Oral-B brush (btw, I change the heads on these brushes almost monthly because it feels like the plaque builds up so fast now) - she&#x27;s astounded at HOW MUCH PLAQUE I HAVE. At every damn visit! I leave with painful, bloody gums. I still brush morning and night and floss nightly. She has me using a stupid water pic. She also has me doing oil pulling. I&#x27;ve spent so much extra money on extra crap and extra time to make up for the poor job this toothbrush does!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, this thing has poor design in that it gets so dirty so fast. And smelly, too. I never had to wipe down my Sonicare toothbrush (esp after every single use) and it never left a mess on my bathroom sink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After my last dental visit I had had enough. I just repurchased a new Sonicare with some sensitive head replacements so I don&#x27;t get the enamel/gum wear. I can&#x27;t wait to throw away this piece of junk and stop doing all of this extra crap!</li>
            <li> had to send it back the brushing head didnt fit on all the way. requested a new one, but great product</li>
            <li> Very nice toothbrush, my family has been using electric toothbrushes for a decade or so and this was a great replacement. The older one was getting dirty and too slow but this one is very strong and easy to keep clean. Very good price for its usage and great for a family since all you&#x27;d need to do is buy more toothbrush heads. Also very sanitary in that way. Toothbrush is well built and not too loud. I&#x27;d definitely recommend it to anybody trying to improve or keep their teeth shiny! Will update if anything goes wrong!</li>
            <li> Helps a lot in getting teeth cleaned. Would buy again.</li>
            <li> Works very well. Has a powerful motor and leaves teeth with the just-cleaned feeling you get from a trip to the dentist. I give it four stars because it only comes with one brush head and no place to store a second one so it cannot feasibly be used by two or more people. Each family member would probably require their own unit.</li>
            <li> I have used this brand of toothbrush for better than 15 years with absolutely no complaints what so ever. Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for a bit over 3 years, moving up gradually as the models have improved. The battery is starting to wear down/show the low battery indicator after 1 brushing sometimes, but I also brush for well over 2 minutes, including using the power tip. I think the OLD Rotadent is the the best electric toothbrush that I have owned, but the new Rotadents keep getting reviews that they&#x27;ll break down within a year, so that&#x27;s not a solution. This Oral-B is still quite good (and to me, easier to handle than the Rotadent), even though I think I still feel a bit of plaque on the teeth at times after brushing (however, the dental appointment comment was that I&#x27;ve got one of the lowest plaque amounts on my teeth, and I only brush twice a day about 1/3 of the time). The reason I&#x27;m commenting now is I&#x27;m thinking of buying another Pro 1000 model before the battery gives out on my present one, especially since I don&#x27;t need those other features of the newer models. It warns me when I&#x27;m brushing too hard by stopping the toothbrush and giving 3 small &amp;#34;buzzing&amp;#34; type sounds, and it takes the &amp;#34;sensitive&amp;#34; brush heads. That&#x27;s all I need in an electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I have owned several different brands of powered toothbrushes, some VERY expensive.  I like this one best. If you are new to this kind of toothbrush, you will immediately feel the difference from regular brush.  Also, does not take up too much room on bathroom counter and replacement brushes are very reasonable.  GREAT buy!</li>
            <li> My mouth definitely feels cleans, when I use it.  I like the choice of replacement brush heads available for this model.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great toothbrush and the replacement heads aren&#x27;t as expensive as some. However, there isn&#x27;t any cover for the head like previous electric toothbrushes I&#x27;ve had. I wish there was!</li>
            <li> Works even better than anticipated.  Went to dentist after using it only a few weeks and for the first time in years they did not mention any problem with my gums.  Teeth seem much cleaner compared to the brush I was using previously.</li>
            <li> This is the best electronic toothbrush I have ever purchased. It is very powerful and cleans my teeth very well.&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend this product without hesitation.</li>
            <li> I have a sonic toothbrush that I really like, but a year ago I found that I needed a second toothbrush to keep at the office and throw in my case for those away from home trips.  I bought this due to name recognition-- I had once had an Oral-B Waterpik I had liked-- and a desire to compare the tooth cleaning experience between the sonic and the plain old electric toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It came with two heads. One is about the size of a small hand toothbrush which is touted for cleaning and whitening.  The other is a small round one for a \\&quot;deep and thorough cleaning.\\&quot;  I haven&#x27;t noticed much difference between the two except the round one is easier to get to my back teeth. Both have indicators show the amount of use.  It is recommended that the brush heads be replaced every three months or when the indicators are half way faded.  Because of the way I use this toothbrush (not all the time) I have not had to replace the heads more than once in the past year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One difference between the sonic toothbrush and this one is that this one stops spinning if too much pressure is applied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The charging station has a small footprint which is very helpful for the old fashioned lavatory I have at the office which has very little space for items kept constantly available.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cleaning experience between the sonic toothbrush and this one is not much different.  Both seem to equally make my teeth and mouth feel fresh.  This toothbrush was quite a bit less expensive than the sonic one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended.</li>
            <li> Perfect for teeth I can tell teeth cleaner already less plaque a real good deal ez to use pulse at 30 seconds</li>
            <li> I am a big fan of oral-b toothbrushes, but everyone should be aware that the chargers are quite likely to quit working within a year. Then you are stuck trying to buy a replacement, because braun/oral-b often changes designs and subsequent models often do not work with previous chargers. In my case, after a very long search, I found a replacement charger for $55 (plus shipping) for my $50 toothbrush at some third party site, but not amazon.  Braun is no help, as they are obviously more interested in selling you a new toothbrush than helping replace your worthless charger.</li>
            <li> I switched to this from a Sonicare and it was the best thing I&#x27;ve done for my dental health.  One minute on each side with gentle pressure cleaned up years of stains and cleaned areas the Sonicare wasn&#x27;t touching.</li>
            <li> This is the first electric toothbrush I have ever owned, so I cannot compare it to other products.  But, I am pleased with the way it cleans my teeth.  It is easy and comfortable to use.</li>
            <li> Cleans my teeth very well. Isn&#x27;t hard to clean itself (I had an older one with the bigger base and it would get dirty and it was hard to clean) and works great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Oral B tooth brushes for years. I bought this new brush because I had a surplus of toothbrush heads for a similar model that broke after 5 years of use.</li>
            <li> Helped a lot with sensitivity and gum line recession.</li>
            <li> replaced my old one due to battery not holding a charge anymore probably because I over charged it. This unit has a battery that will last a week w/o charging when brushing twice/day and then the battery low indicator will come on, a great feature.</li>
            <li> This Oral B electric toothbrush cleans very well, is somewhat quite and alerts you when you need to recharge, Great value for the cost.</li>
            <li> We purchased two of these, and from the first use on, both would start and stop. This was not a feature, as it happened intermittently. Why this happened I have no idea, as the brush seemed to be powerful. But this did not bode well for an appropriate lifespan, so we returned them.</li>
            <li> Love this toothbrush. so worth the money. my teeth have never  been so clean. i like that i don&#x27;t have to charge it everyday. i only charge it once a week.</li>
            <li> This is my first electric toothbrush so I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect out of it, to be honest I was intimidated by all the choices out there! So far I&#x27;ve had this for a few months and think I picked a winner. It&#x27;s not fancy but I don&#x27;t need it to be. It lets me know when to switch quadrants of my mouth and I like that feature a lot, I definitely wasn&#x27;t brushing long enough before. My teeth feel so much cleaner after I&#x27;m done brushing so I know it must be so much better than my manual brush was. I&#x27;m very satisfied and haven&#x27;t had any problems!</li>
            <li> I bought this item when my old one -- also Oral-B -- finally died.  I was really pleased to find that this one worked at a higher frequency than the old one, and the result was that my mouth felt considerably cleaner after use.</li>
            <li> Needed a replacement as our 25+ yr old Oral-B died. We shopped around before coming to Amazon (what were we thinking!!), and were suprised to find that we could save $30 by buying from Amazon. And with our prime we didn&#x27;t even have to pay shipping! As with all Oral-B products we have, we find the quality to be excellent and well worth the money!</li>
            <li> I had an older version and this replaced it. I like Oral-B products. This newer model I would definitely buy again. The previous model I had came with three brushes, I didn&#x27;t need a larger version.</li>
            <li> I just can&#x27;t say it enough. I love this toothbrush and my teeth feel so much healthier. Plaque has been obliterated.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. The only con I have on it is every 30 sec. it has a brief pause while it is running. Even if you shut it off right before the pause, when you press it on again, it quickly pauses again. Nothing major, but find it annoying at times.</li>
            <li> Good purchase product as a expected</li>
            <li> There is NO brush head storage base as the picture shows.&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, the toothbrush works pretty well.</li>
            <li> When you put in your mouth it goes crazy</li>
            <li> A really rough brush compared to the dazzle pro. Not my fav.</li>
            <li> Completely satisfied with delivery and performance of the product</li>
            <li> This is a great basic electric rechargeable toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;It has enough features to do a great job.&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t need a timer and a carrying case.&lt;br /&gt;The battery life isn&#x27;t quite as good as I&#x27;d like. That&#x27;s why I gave it a 4 out of 5&lt;br /&gt;but it&#x27;s easy enough to charge it up.</li>
            <li> Very nice toothbrush.</li>
            <li> This product was recommended by my dentist. Compared to other much more expensive mechanical brushes. This is all that you need. very satisfied!!!</li>
            <li> i like it , i have used Oral-b in the past , i bought one for my husband ,so far he seems to like it . my teeth feel clean and they look white</li>
            <li> These brushes are great. I use it with the soft head refills. They are easier on your gums. This is a great price on amazon too. I never even considered any other when my old one finally died. The oral b is a quality machine.</li>
            <li> My teeth feel like I&#x27;ve just left the dentist office after every brushing.  It eliminates bad breath! I have seen the light.</li>
            <li> Works well, reasonably priced, does not come with case or extra brush heads or anything to store brush head(s) in except on the handle itself. So a good buy as a one-person brush but not ideal for families or couples who share. Small base is very compact and unobtrusive on the counter.</li>
            <li> This product does a great job, well made, lots of power&lt;br /&gt;pro&#x27;s  I like evering about it.&lt;br /&gt;con&#x27;s  Havent found anything yet.&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend to a friend.</li>
            <li> This is my 4th Oral-B. Have used several models and nevr had a complaint. Proof is that my oral hygiene has beenk great for years.</li>
            <li> I bought this slim electric toothbrush after my dental hygienist recommended it. I tend to brush too hard, and this product nearly stops when I do so, so that feature is a plus for me. It has the capacity to work on 3 different settings by clicking the one button a different number of times - I would not have known had I not read the instructions, and I am not sure I can differentiate between the three, but regardless it works well. The downsize is that there is not a cap for the brush head, so I wouldn&#x27;t bring it on travel. it&#x27;s footprint is tiny - about a square inch, and the cord is super long.</li>
            <li> This my favorite electric toothbrush so far. It cleans your teeth much better than a non-electric toothbrush and the plug in version is more powerful than the battery operated ones.</li>
            <li> feels like it really cleans efficiently</li>
            <li> I got this toothbrush about a month and a half ago to replace a Sonic Care one that died on me and so far I love it even more than my old one when it was new. My teeth are getting so clean. It is much more powerful and my teeth feel so much better. I would recommend this toothbrush to anyone!</li>
            <li> Puting something electrical inside your mouth !! Generally not the thig to do, but this is safe and effective in cleaning teeth and making the mouth feel good.</li>
            <li> Bought this a gift and haven&#x27;t heard any complaints besides that it&#x27;s a little loud then expected.  It did come on time and in good condition.</li>
            <li> I bought this brush for my son, just because all family members have one each.  Surprisingly he just visited the dentist and they amazed that he had no cavities. I say thanks to this brush, it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this toothbrush for 1.5 years and it&#x27;s still going strong!  I&#x27;ve went through several heads, which are a bit expensive and don&#x27;t last super long, but it works well enough to make it worth it.  I was so impressed that I bought a pink one for my wife and she loves it.  We both like the Precision Clean head which it comes with.  Try the flossing action one if you like the feeling of a jackhammer on your gums!</li>
            <li> MY WIFE PURCHASED THIS ORAL B .EASE OF USE SUPERIOR WAY TOO BRUSH YOUR TEETH I&#x27;LL NEVER GO BACK TOO THE OLD FASHION WAY OF BRUSHING TEETH, THIS PRODUCT IS THE BEST</li>
            <li> My periodontist recommended this type of spin brush over the $10 variety and it has produced noticeably better results for my gums.  It holds its charge for days.  I actually keep the charger in my bedroom, while using the brush in the bathroom, of course. The one drawback will be the higher price for replacement spinning heads.</li>
            <li> It seems to rattle a little more than my last Oral-B&lt;br /&gt;I still like this brand better then others, but probably would not get this model again&lt;br /&gt;maybe its the toothbrush head, I&#x27;ll try switching the head, maybe that will help</li>
            <li> I love electric toothbrushes! this one moves so fast I had to get used to it but it works great. made me little dissy at first, no joke! Plus with the mail in rebate it was way affordable! My dentist always tell me how I have very little plaque... I know it&#x27;s from the toothbrush!</li>
            <li> I like this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I had an older version of the Oral-B Electric toothbrush.  It lasted about 15 years!  The new toothbrush is lighter, cleaner looking and operates just as well as the old.  It&#x27;s quiet and has a timer that indicates every 30 seconds by a pause in action so you can thoroughly clean your teeth.  Highly recommend!!!</li>
            <li> I started using this and find I can not go back to a regular toothbrush.  Even my dentist approves of it.</li>
            <li> Noisy. I liked my ro to dent better. I will see how it really does at my next checkup.with the dentist.</li>
            <li> This is one of my best investment ever! I was on the verge of having periodontal disease and after 2 months of using this, my dentist says my gums are in top notch shape. It doesn&#x27;t have all the bells and whistle, but it gets the job done! I like that it beeps every 30 seconds so I can switch to each quadrant of my teeth. It last me a week before I have to charge it. The only negative is that it takes forever to fully charge! I think 24 hours!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sleek and clean looking but it has a slow grind rather than the old one which had 2 speeds. One slow and one fast. This new one is noisy.</li>
            <li> Works great, but I don&#x27;t particularly care for the blinking lights when the battery is low.  I&#x27;ve used this brand for about 20 years and find the quality reliable.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush does a good job and the battery lasts a good amount of time.  There is a battery indicator, but it is unnecessary--one knows the battery is low when using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The battery is not replaceable by the user.  So, I don&#x27;t know how many years the battery will last, before I must buy another one.</li>
            <li> Simple, straightforward, single-speed device; works just as expected. Higher speed, more compact, and far superior to earlier versions of the Oral-B electric toothbrush that I have owned.</li>
            <li> The first time I used this product I was impressed it felt just like I had my teeth cleaned at the dentist office.</li>
            <li> Having had a Sonicare I thought after reading the reviews this might be something a little different that I would like.  I don&#x27;t.  Noisy, difficult to make sure you are getting the whole tooth surface.  I find after I use it I follow up with my regular toothbrush.</li>
            <li> excellent toothbrush for the money!  works as well as more expensive models.  highly recommended.  Oral B replacement heads are reasonably priced also.</li>
            <li> It leaves my teeth really clean. Improves the strenght of gums.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m certain this will be an excellent toothbrush, as it&#x27;s reviewed by independent sources very highly.  My issue is that Amazon is selling this toothbrush to international customers - and it doesn&#x27;t have a dual voltage charger!  No notice anywhere on the page saying &amp;#34;this toothbrush will only work with 110-130V - but hey! we&#x27;ll ship it to your 220-240V household, no problem!&amp;#34;  Amazon, why would you sell electronics overseas if you know they won&#x27;t work overseas????</li>
            <li> This is my first electric toothbrush and I&#x27;ve been using it for months - no complaints! I haven&#x27;t had any problems so far. The toothbrush works great, charges great (admittedly it takes a long time for each charge, but that&#x27;s not a big deal), and is easy to clean. It&#x27;s very loud, but I hear that that&#x27;s the norm for electric toothbrushes. I&#x27;d recommend this to anyone looking to make the switch from a regular toothbrush to electric.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Oral-B rechargeable electric toothbrushes for the past 20+ years.  In all that time, the item listed in this review is only the third one I&#x27;ve had to buy.  In fact, the Oral-B that I replaced with this new one wasn&#x27;t out of working order .... it just didn&#x27;t hold a charge as long as it used to.  My newest Oral-B does as fine a job of cleaning as its predecessors did.  In contrast to other rechargeable electric toothbrushes, the Oral-B has a smaller, round head which more readily allows it to access ALL areas of my teeth.  In my pre-Oral-B days I needed to visit my dentist every 4 months for teeth cleaning because of a problem I had with plaque buildup on the back of my bottom front teeth.  Once I began using an Oral-B, no more plaque problem!  I&#x27;ve been able to save money because now I see the dentist only twice a year instead of three times a year for regular check-ups.  There&#x27;s a feature with this Oral-B that didn&#x27;t exist with my previous ones -- while operating, it is programmed to hesitate for a couple of second every couple of minutes, as a cue to the length of time that a quadrant of your mouth should be brushed.  I find the hesitation to be a bit annoying and unnecessary, but I guess that feature is aimed at kids.  All in all, a fine product that I&#x27;d highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Have used an Oral-B for 7 years. My first one just gave out. Cannot imagine going back to manual brushing. This system gives you superior oral hygiene in just 4 minutes a day. Good for your teeth and gums,  gives the just came from the hygienist feel everyday.</li>
            <li> I love this tooth brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ive had other mechanical tooth brushes but this one is by far the best and the price is great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the battery life on the tooth brush last for a few days.. maybe even up to a week and half so you dont always have to leave it on the charger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;its durable, easy to use, and cleans well.</li>
            <li> I love this - unfortunately I can&#x27;t figure out how to change the heads. I don&#x27;t think it is the product, I believe it&#x27;s operator error.</li>
            <li> We have 4 Oral-B electric toothbrushes, and have used them for years. One stopped holding a charge, so we got this one. Very disappointing - it is LOUDER than the cheaper Vitality model, pinches my lip in a gap that&#x27;s designed into it, and instead of signaling when you&#x27;ve been brushing for a total of 2 minutes, it signals every 30 seconds to time the brushing of each quadrant of your mouth. Dumb! I hate this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> So far so good.  It was relatively inexpensive compared to the more expensive ones but I am satisfied with it.  No timer or fancy sterilizer but it is fine.  I have had it for just one week so we will see how it holds.</li>
            <li> I have used an electric toothbrush before, and I was less than impressed.  However, this one really works.  My teeth feel much cleaner after using this brush.  It does a very good job of dislodging seeds from strawberries and blueberries that I am not even aware they are between my teeth.  Very satisfied with this purchase.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush had everything I needed, great vibration and agitation of the teeth and gums, a nice recharger, and easy to hold with a small enough head to reach tight places in your mouth.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s meant to stop pulsating if brushing too hard? This is the main reason I got this toothbrush as it stated this in the details, however this feature is nom- existent in my brush.&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise it&#x27;s really great!</li>
            <li> I bought one for myself and loved it, then I bought two for my parents as Christmas gifts. I only charge it once a week for 24 hours. It has been over a year and the battery is still working great!</li>
            <li> We got this to replace our old Braun Sonicare which was difficult to keep clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although this product is comparatively easier to keep clean, it&#x27;s messier to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush heads are a hollow tube with holes at the top and the bottom, so when you brush, even if you keep your mouth shut, you&#x27;ll dribble spit and toothpaste out of the bottom of the brush head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s fine if you brush leaning over the sink, but if you don&#x27;t, you&#x27;re going to be wiping up drips from your feet or the floor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other issue with this brush is that my dentist told me it can be harder on the gums than Sonicare.</li>
            <li> Teeth feel as it I just got out of the dentists chair. Easy to use and does a much better job than regular tooth brush. Small brush surface could be a little larger I feel, but that is a personal preference</li>
            <li> this was a Christmas gift, and it has worked out great. my wife loves it and so do i. thanks again</li>
            <li> The toothbrush easily serves all MY needs -- but MAYBE others are better.  I notice some of this model come with a travel case.&lt;br /&gt;the one I ordered didn&#x27;t -- but I knew when I ordered it no case was available.</li>
            <li> Having had dental issues, the electric toothbrush is the only solution to making sure that teeth get clean!!!  However it was a bit pricey.</li>
            <li> Excellent product- cleans thoroughly yet is not harsh.  Charger works very well.  A good buy and reliable product that does what is expected.</li>
            <li> Works great! It hold a charge for a week of usage. Lots of brushing power. Excellent product.&lt;br /&gt;Waiting to see how long the head lasts and the cost of replacement.</li>
            <li> Took me a long time do decide on an electric brush.  Finally bought this after a recommendation from my dentist office.  I&#x27;ve already purchased a second one for my daughter.  Only draw back is I wish I had a cover for the brush.</li>
            <li> I have wanted a rechargeable toothbrush for awhile so I finally ordered this one and I love it.  Makes my teeth feel as clean as after I leave the dentist.  Would recommend to friends and family.</li>
            <li> Have tried MANY types of toothbrushes to encourage a seven-year-old boy to brush his teeth longer than 3 seconds, and he actually likes this one and goes the full two minutes.  Hope he keeps it up.  It did not even hurt his gums when he first started using although his previous toothbrushes were either non-electric or battery operated kids brushes.  I will let you know if he is still brushing well after 6 months.</li>
            <li> Bought it because I have tooth sensitivity and have a root canal done in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-cheap-ish (Target sold these for 39 bucks for a while)&lt;br /&gt;-different brush head designs available (over half a dozen) for different cleaning styles (also a con)&lt;br /&gt;-rechargeable&lt;br /&gt;-cleans better than manual brushes&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-instructions are vague and in broken English, still can&#x27;t figure out how to toggle between the different speed settings--or there just isn&#x27;t any difference. Allegedly there is a sensitive teeth setting, doesn&#x27;t seem any different from the other two (whitening and regular). For that matter, what is a whitening setting?&lt;br /&gt;-takes forever (over a day) to charge, doesn&#x27;t hold charge \\&quot;about a week\\&quot; as stated&lt;br /&gt;-different brush heads are all essentially the same, except for the flossing one which actually works pretty good&lt;br /&gt;-pressure cutoff doesn&#x27;t really work, claims to stop brushing if you push too hard. I pushed the brush head against my thumb with some considerable force, much more than any sane person would do when brushing and couldn&#x27;t get it to disengage.&lt;br /&gt;-\\&quot;stutters\\&quot; meant to get you to switch to another quadrant are annoying, and can&#x27;t be turned off&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short:&lt;br /&gt;You can get a rechargeable toothbrush that uses the same heads for half the price at most grocery stores (either Oral-B or a generic brand) that doesn&#x27;t have all of these useless upgrades.</li>
            <li> Update: I never got back to this but two of us bought one of these on the basis of a rebate and neither of us ever received the rebate. The battery is now starting to need to be recharged noticeably more often now, so expect the life of one of these to last 3-4 years, which might not be as long as you expected it to last. I have a personal policy that when I get screwed over on a rebate, I do my best to not buy items from the same company again. While it might be difficult to avoid all Proctor and Gamble products, I will avoid Oral B products from now on, just as I avoid medicines from Abbott Pharmaceuticals after they screwed me over on a rebate for a blood glucose monitor. I figure that they&#x27;ll lose a lot more money on me than they gained by screwing me on a rebate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This electric toothbrush works very well. No gimmicks, it just works. It&#x27;s the one recommended to me by my dental hygienist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every 30 seconds for the 2-minute standard timing for brushing your teeth, it vibrates differently to let you now it&#x27;s time to move on to the next quadrant in your mouth. You can stop the brush at that point to add more toothpaste (I use baking soda myself) and press it again. It remembers where you are in the time cycle unless you leave it off for a couple of minutes, when it will reset itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It takes a long time to charge up fully the first time, but that&#x27;s a good thing since the charger is not forcing a lot of current into the battery. You can store it on the charging base or elsewhere. It will need another charge in about a week. Every several months you should completely discharge the battery then recharge it according to the instructions. You may find that not keeping it on the charging base and just charging it when it runs down may provide a longer battery life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The battery appears to not be replaceable, but you can remove it when it&#x27;s time to dispose of the product so you can recycle it properly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product came with a plastic travel case, which I may use infrequently, but it&#x27;s nice to have something to protect it. There are generic brush heads available. I haven&#x27;t tried any of these yet, but I have read that some generic brush heads do not last and break. Some work, others don&#x27;t, and you can have a mix of these in a batch if you buy them from online auction sites. If you buy them from Amazon, you can return them if you find them to be defective or are otherwise not satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brushes have some bristles with a tint that fades over time to let you know when it&#x27;s time to replace it. I think it&#x27;s more of a marketing tool to get you to buy replacement heads more often, but you can use that as a reminder if you prefer. I will replace mine when it feels too soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can buy a few different types of brush heads for this device. The user guide shows which ones you can buy and what each one&#x27;s purpose is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush heads have a colored ring between the head and handle so you can tell one from another if more than two people in a household use the same product. The downside is that when you buy the product, you have no way of knowing which color of ring is in the package. We bought two of them and fortunately they had different colors to tell them apart. The replacement heads, if you buy them in a multi-pack, have different colored rings, so if you buy one of those packs when you buy the product, you will probably have several colors to choose from. Alternatively, you would color one ring with fingernail polish and let it dry before putting it on a brush head, or just use some colored tape around one or more of them in your bathroom. You could even make a label for each handle with the user&#x27;s name on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is much better than the inexpensive ones I&#x27;ve had in the past. I will definitely brush my teeth more often now that it&#x27;s so easy to do. Easy to do? How hard can it be to brush your teeth with a regular toothbrush?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You have to try one of these to understand. I tend to brush too quickly, and this device helps me time how long I brush in each quarter of my mouth. Sure, I could set a timer and keep an eye on it, switching to different parts of my mouth as the timer counts down, but this is very convenient. It also probably does a better job without brushing too hard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oral B (made by Braun) makes different models that use the same brush heads. This model is great. I haven&#x27;t tried the others, but they are likely well made, like other products I&#x27;ve had made by Braun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you found this review helpful, please click the YES button below this review.

            <li> Never go wrong with Braun.</li>
            <li> I like the auto &amp;#34;you&#x27;ve been brushing your teeth too long feature&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Liked it so much, bought two more for family members! Smile is brighter and gums feel like they are in a healthier condition. Very smart purchase.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been buying, and when needed replacing, Oral-B electric toothbrush for years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good battery life even with 10 days of travel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;German quality of the toothbrush head is most evident versus the Chinese-made knockoffs sold in stores like BJ&#x27;s. Hate the price but lifespan of a new Oral-B toothbrush head is several months.</li>
            <li> My teeth have never felt cleaner! It works great. I&#x27;ve never had a problem brushing less than two minutes, usually I do three, so having the pulses tell me every 30 seconds and 2 minutes is very nice.</li>
            <li> I purchased this after using a Phillips Sonicare the last few years.I don&#x27;t have to recharge it as much and the sensor is a nice feature.The smaller brush makes it easier to reach the back teeth.The only downfall is it seems to drip a bit more water while I am brushing my teeth.</li>
            <li> Excellent although I&#x27;m not crazy about the timer feature. As an adult who knows how to brush my teeth, the 4 timer pauses (as quick as they are) interrupt and slow down my brushing process.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not really crazy about this one.  I&#x27;ve had the Oral B before and loved it.  This one feels like a jack hammer is in your mouth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had two other Oral-B Electric toothbrushes in the past. So when my last one died I decided to, of course, buy a new one. First my Pros and Cons list:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;Strong vibrations from the brush head&lt;br /&gt;Reasonably priced&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;Handle is a little narrow&lt;br /&gt;Base is just a little bigger than the bottom of the toothbrush bottom&lt;br /&gt;Wish there was a little more rubber grip on handle&lt;br /&gt;Power button is a bit small&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;REVIEW:&lt;br /&gt;Even though I had more cons than pros, don&#x27;t get me wrong, I still really like this toothbrush. I am just nitpicking little details I wish could be improved on. For example, I wish the handle was a little thicker just so it could fit nicely into my hand. My two previous electric Oral-B toothbrushes has a nice feel in my hand size-wise. Also, a little more rubber for the grip would improve comfort and, of course, grip while using the brush.&lt;br /&gt;The power button also was a little small and hard. This can make it a little difficult turning the toothbrush on and off. Sometimes my thumb is pressing several times trying to find the power button. Nitpicking, but it is a little annoying.&lt;br /&gt;The base is little narrow so it feels like you can easily tip it over or knock your brush off the base. My previous models had a backing so at least it felt more secure. Maybe some people like the small footprint of the base. So it could just be me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I still really like my brush and I still would recommend it. I do like the powerful vibrations of the brush head, maybe even stronger than my old ones. It feels like it does a good job cleaning my teeth, which is all that matters anyway. And since it is reasonably priced, I am happy.</li>
            <li> better than expected.</li>
            <li> This is my first rechargable toothbrush. No idea what took me so long. Does the job well, makes my mouth feel clean and no changing batteries every 2 months!</li>
            <li> It is unbelievably fast and strong and does a good job. I like it a lot!</li>
            <li> Received as promised.  Thank you!!</li>
            <li> Performs as advertised well worth the  price.</li>
            <li> This is the 2nd oral b professional toothbrush I have had and I love it. It feels like your teeth are actually being cleaned while brushing. I love this one.</li>
            <li> Bought this toothbrush with the name recognition instead of reading all the reviews.  It is a very low-end product.  First off it very loud.  The battery only keeps a short charge compared to the last one I had.  The rotating brush will actually stop with even the slightest pressure on your teeth.  But the biggest problem is the bristles are barely longer than the length of the head of the toothbrush.  So when you are brushing your teeth the plastic center of the toothbrush head is always hitting your teeth and gums and it is very uncomfortable feeling.  Very basic, no timer, does not pulse, very load, and battery time is very short.  Not to many pros.</li>
            <li> Product works better than expected.</li>
            <li> Good for the price works as wxpected</li>
            <li> i needed to replace my old &amp;#34;Vitality&amp;#34; model (had it for 8 years) and this one exceeded my expectations.  I feel like I just left the dentist ever time I brush.  And the charge lasts a week!</li>
            <li> Great product. My first one lasted eight years.</li>
            <li> Awesome toothbrush! would highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Works great and I am able to use my old wall mounted charger.  Plaque has no where to hide when using this!</li>
            <li> Simple but works great!</li>
            <li> good basic tooth brush. could be a little slimmer with today&#x27;s battery tech, but you get what you pay for. i have had two of these in the last 5 years (lost first one at hotel in bangcock).</li>
            <li> This was bought as an update for an old Oral-B toothbrush.  What a difference - holds a charge longer than the instructions say and is much lighter (brush as well as the charger).  It also does a better job cleaning my teeth.  After reading the reviews this brush was the right choice.</li>
            <li> Put this thing in your mouth before turning it on or it flings toothpaste all over your bathroom.</li>
            <li> I already own a lesser expensive model of the Oral b but it was time to replace it.  When I saw there was a professional model that was affordable I bought it.  I would recommend the the Oral B Professional to anyone who likes electrib brushes.  The handle is nice and has a nice feel and the brush s very good.  You will want to take your time brushing and enjoy the ride.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used normal tooth brushes my entire life and this thing is awesome. My teeth feel so much cleaner after brushing, though I don&#x27;t know if they actually are. The timer also makes sure I don&#x27;t brush poorly when I&#x27;m tired and lazy.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this purchase. I had an old Oral B electric toothbrush that finally died after many years.  This new one pulsates much more quickly and seems to do a better job of brushing.  I would definitely recommend it.  good price on amazon.</li>
            <li> I had an Oral B electric toothbrush since 1995. I thought I would replace it with a new one for Christmas.  Sadly I have had this one since December and it is junk.  First a hairline crack developed near the base where it sits on the charger. Now that crack has become enormous. I am going to call Oral B and see if they will make it right. Sadly many products are no longer made the way they used to be.</li>
            <li> Does everything I want this to do, at this price point.  Did have some issues with moldy smell, though.</li>
            <li> Have had several Oral-B brushes.  Happy with all.  On sale, bought 2 for children. Great value</li>
            <li> Got this when it was on sale for less than a third of retail price (assuming the mail-in-rebate comes). I&#x27;m not sure if I would pay retail for this but it is really good compared to a regular toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My dentist recommended this kind of toothbrush and I&#x27;m glad I was able to find it on sale. Cleans better and faster than a regular toothbrush with less effort. Even works on the tongue really well. The only downside is the vibrations can give you a headache if you&#x27;re not used to it. I guess that&#x27;s why some people prefer spinning type of toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried them both and agree with other reviewers. The ORAL-B is way less expensive than the Sonic and equal (if not better) in quality.</li>
            <li> its a little loud- otherwise great!</li>
            <li> The battery died a few days after the 60-day money back guarantee ran out. The two-year limited warrantee is worthless: we&#x27;d have to ship it back at our own expense (a $15 proposition) and get it back a month later (assuming there are no delays due to weather or holidays).</li>
            <li> Upgrade from an older model to this. Works&lt;br /&gt;great. Has a lot of the features from previous flagship&lt;br /&gt;model. If you have an older Oral-B I would recommend upgrading&lt;br /&gt;to this series instead of just buying new heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Battery life isn&#x27;t as good as old NiCad models. Takes longer to&lt;br /&gt;charge. But NiMH is better for the environment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Got it for $20 after $20 mail in rebate. Very happy with it.</li>
            <li> I chose this product bacause I know the name brand. Oral-B. Easy and tiny to use and reasonable price. I Just need to buy replacement brush.</li>
            <li> Bought this second unit for travel.  It&#x27;s been the best way to keep our teeth clean, removing previous staining, and reduce cavities!  We&#x27;ll keep one in use always.</li>
            <li> So I think this is a good basic electric toothbrush. The head is tiny so it fits on each tooth and only takes a drop of toothpaste. It vibrates strongly, which I&#x27;m still trying to get used to. My skull vibrates and my eyeballs vibrate with it and it&#x27;s a weird uncomfortable feeling. I found it doesn&#x27;t reduce the need to floss even a little bit. It seems to clean the surfaces very well. But when I floss afterwards, it&#x27;s amazing how much stuff still comes out from between the teeth. So it may be beneficial to use an electric toothbrush but if you do a good job on each tooth with a plain old manual toothbrush, I would probably save my money.</li>
            <li> i had one that used batteries and it died often and was only fully charged for a day or two so i decided to get one with a plug so it&#x27;s always fully charged. i kind of think it&#x27;s too forceful now though. i&#x27;m going to try the different head for it for sensitive gums but that could just be me. my teeth do feel so clean though!!!</li>
            <li> I will tell you that my dentist had recommended a different brand and a higher model in that brand with lots of bells and whistles. When I read the reviews for this electric toothbrush, I took a chance on it.  I was astounded the first time I used it. My teeth felt as though I had just had them cleaned except there was no blood and pain. No bells or whistles.  It just runs. But boy does it clean. Very pleased. Have not seen my dentist yet but I know my teeth and gums feel better.</li>
            <li> When I was little I used to have an electric toothbrush. I hated it and vowed to never own one again. This year I went to the dentist and she highly recommended that I get a Sonic brush. I opted for this one instead 1) for the price and 2) because from reading other reviews, it seemed as if cleaning this one was a bit easier. The sonic set I was going to get was only 5 dollars more and came with an extra sensitive brush head....wish this came with one as well to see which brush head I prefer, but not a big deal at all. In terms of charging it, it will take about 24 hours for the green light to stop flashing. Don&#x27;t worry, nothing&#x27;s wrong.</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended this particular brush for me. I feel like it is doing the job well. I was happy with the price compared to other places, and the product seems solid, the brush head is comfortable and cleans well.</li>
            <li> best toothbrush Ive ever owned. My teeth used to hurt all of the time and I got a bunch of cavities, but who would have thought, this changed all that</li>
            <li> It works very well. The design makes it easy to use and effective to use. It just drops onto the charger with no hassles. This is a big improvement over other powered brushes that I have used.</li>
            <li> I chose this rating because I&#x27;m very pleased with the toothbrush.  My dental hygienist said that my teeth have never looked so good.  You can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li> This is my second Oral-B toothbrush.  The first lasted for years before the battery no longer held a charge.  It was an easy decision to buy a replacement.  I would have rated this product 5-stars except they have &amp;#34;cheaped out&amp;#34;  on the changing stand.  It is much smaller than my last one and tends to stick to the bottom of the toothbrush every time I pick it up.  It would have been a wiser decision to charge a dollar or two more and provide a better charging base.  The brush itself does an outstanding job.</li>
            <li> I am terribly disappointed; this product was purchased by me prior to leaving for our destination wedding and malfunctioned while we were away. Now, I cannot even return it to amazon because of the return policy!&lt;br /&gt;Obviously I was not expecting this product to cease functioning within 2 months of ordering it.&lt;br /&gt;The battery is faulty and simply wont charge, or so I assume, as it wont even charge when plugged in and wont turn on.&lt;br /&gt;Never again will I purchase oral b. I will stick to phillips sonicare, which worked wonderfully for two years.</li>
            <li> good price!!! well worth it!!! keeps teeth clean like dentist does!!!&lt;br /&gt;good for gums and great current rebate!!!&lt;br /&gt;requires minimal space in the bathroom!!</li>
            <li> This is the first time I used an electric toothbrush and this toothbrush meets my expectations - very satisfied, no hesitation recommending.</li>
            <li> We have had this brush for over a year and it works great with no problem. My teeth feel so much cleaner using this brush rather than a manual brush. I would recommend this to everyone. And a great price on amazon.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my mother as it would be easier for her to maintain her dental care and to prevent plaque build up.  It is a wonderful product and fulfills my mother&#x27;s needs.</li>
            <li> I have been using Oral-B electric tooth  brushes for past years and wanted one for trip, but this unit missed the functions for gentle and slow modes</li>
            <li> I bought a higher price model last Christmas and wanted another one but at a cheaper price.  I was looking for certain features - timer, pressure sensor.  This model had both but not like a higher price model.  That is the only reason why I am giving it 3 stars.</li>
            <li> I like it very much and it works very good. This is one of the choices that my dentist uggested.</li>
            <li> 1st electric toothbrush, works very well, holds a good charge and is efficient at cleaning teeth. noticeable difference vs old toothbrush. Would recommend to any one interested in one.</li>
            <li> Our old one was wearing out--the head would come off; so this  one was just great.  It does a good job on our teeth, and we are both pleased.</li>
            <li> Love it! I had another Oral-B pro before this one. It had multiple speeds. I guess I didn&#x27;t read the details well enough and just assumed this one would too. But either way, it does a great job of cleaning. My mouth feels amazing after every brushing.</li>
            <li> Works great!  Love the small charger!!!  Want to get one for everyone in my family.  Much better than the ones we had.</li>
            <li> I chose this over another product because of the lower brush head replacement price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product seems to meet my needs.</li>
            <li> Excellent. Works great. Hold a charge for a long time.</li>
            <li> I am disappointed with the brush head size and the difficulty on keeping the unit clean.  It also came with no cover for the brush and that is disappointing.</li>
            <li> I did a lot of research before deciding on the Oral-B Professional Care 1000 and I love my purchase. It was cost effective, simple (just one power button), and does a great job cleaning your teeth and Dentists agree. Features include four 30 second cycles that are for the four quadrents of your mouth, and a pressure sensor to make sure you don&#x27;t brush too hard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So get a great tooth brush without breaking the bank, your mouth will thank you for it.</li>
            <li> I needed to replace my old Oral-B this Oral -B electric toothbrush was Excellent and at a great price just as advertived.</li>
            <li> This is a good basic electric toothbrush. The only &amp;#34;extra&amp;#34; is the 30 second interval pulse for brushing. I thought it might come with a sensitive speed, too, but not in this model.</li>
            <li> After using the same electric toothbrush for almost 10 years (a Braun 3D), the batteries just couldn&#x27;t keep charged &amp; it was time for a new one. Bought this &amp; it works great! Lightweight, runs strong, lets you know every 30 seconds to move along for 2 minutes of brushing (brush your mouth in 1/4s). Easy to hold when dry, otherwise grip is a little slippery when wet. Hopefully this will last for 10 years.</li>
            <li> Excellent service i recommended to anyone ji ji ji ji ji ji ji ji ji ji ji ji ji ji</li>
            <li> It is conpact, can reach the back side of the the teeth, easy handle and cleans well and  as I expected.</li>
            <li> This is my second sonic toothbrush from Oral-B.  It is easy to use and can be tucked into a suitcase.  Short trips don&#x27;t even need the charger.  And my checkups have never been better!</li>
            <li> I hate the vibrating feeling in my mouth. I was forced to buy this when Interplak stropped making their rotating toothbrushes. I LOVED Interplak. I HATE the sonic vibrating style of any brush but there&#x27;s nothing else now. It doesn&#x27;t clean as well as the spinning brushes despite their claim to. This is just OK. Please come back with a spinning bristle head!</li>
            <li> The reason I gave this product 1 star is because this is the 2nd time I’ve been burned by it.  The 1st one I purchased lasted 6 months and this one only lasted a month. Don’t waste your money.  Spend a little more and buy something better.  The thing that sucks is that I’m in Afghanistan deployed with the Army and when things break you just can’t go down to the store and buy a replacement.</li>
            <li> While waiting for it to arrive had to use conventional toothbrush. Didn&#x27;t clean my teeth as well. When product arrived I immediately brushed my teeth and it felt oh so good. Although it didn&#x27;t take long to arrive it was worth the wait. I love this product. By the way, my dentist says my teeth look better sense using this versus conventional brush.</li>
            <li> I imagine this toothbrush is just like the more expensive ones, like my wife&#x27;s that I have used.  It just doesn&#x27;t have and special attachments or anything.  It&#x27;s just a toothbrush on a small base.</li>
            <li> We bought our first one of these about 15 years ago.  About 5 years ago something happened on a trip and it stopped working, so we bought a second one.  But then the old one returned from the dead and gave us another 5 years.  We used it until about 6 months ago when it finally would not hold a charge.  This is when we got our third one (reviewed here).  I&#x27;m an engineer and am just fascinated that you can make a consumer electronics device like this that runs for 15 years--amazing.  (JPL needs to open one of these up.)  The other thing I like is that the charger interface is exactly the same as it was on our original one from 15 years ago.  We have one charger on the vanity.  One of the brushes is always sitting in the charger and they get swapped every 3 or 4 days. The newer charger (a tiny thing) sits in the travel bag.  Anyway, I&#x27;m a fan.  It cleans teeth too.</li>
            <li> I purchased this as a gift for my husband and he thinks it is the best thing since sliced bread.</li>
            <li> second one I have had, the first lasted about 3-4 years!  Does a great job, I do throw the head that comes with it away and use a sensitive, softer head (better for the gums, less harsh).  My dentist office sells the same model, and has for 4 years.  They promote the use of electric toothbrush, I agree that they work better than manual: more effective.  My cleanings are quicker.  This is a good brand, works great.</li>
            <li> If you want clean teeth you need an electronic toothbrush! however, this is cheaper at Costco and I wish it had dual speeds instead of just one speed, otherthan that i am happy with it</li>
            <li> My new dentist recommended this for me and, while I&#x27;ll was very hesitant to switch to an automatic brush, I&#x27;m so glad I did.  After spending two weeks travelling without it, I noticed a very big difference in my teeth!</li>
            <li> This toothbrush works well; cleans fast and deep, is easy to use and maintain.&lt;br /&gt;The Oral-B Professional \\&quot;Precision 1000\\&quot; is lightweight but powerful.&lt;br /&gt;Being completely waterproof and induction-charged suggests a long product life.</li>
            <li> Much better than my previous type...I wasn&#x27;t sure I would like the tiny head on it, but I can easily see that I have lots less tartar...so could even floss less!The handle is smaller than I am used to, but adjustment comes eventurally!  It is easier to get inside my front teeth with the small rotating head.</li>
            <li> Good product. Makes my mouth feel like I just came from a cleaning at the dentist. Like the timer feature.</li>
            <li> Compact and works great. Once you switch to an electric toothbrush there is no going back.</li>
            <li> This unit is loud and kind of feels like a small jackhammer but seems to do a good job. I previously had a more expensive model and can tell the difference in quality.</li>
            <li> Love it! Even better than my sonic that I had. Didn&#x27;t think I would like the round brushes but it actually goes around the tooth a lot better.  Only reason why I gave it a four star is because it doesn&#x27;t come with a cover for the brush and for some reason I thought this model was the one that had all these fancy options, but it doesn&#x27;t but I still love it.</li>
            <li> We chose the oral B electric tooth brush as a replacement for an older model, which still works.&lt;br /&gt;The new one has nice blue color and a led to indicate when charging.&lt;br /&gt;We also have a years supply of brush heads for it. Iwould recommend it to anyone looking for a good electric tooth brush.</li>
            <li> I had another Braun toothbrush for over 20 years. It finally gave up the ghost and the new one is superior.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best electric toothbrushes I have ever used. It does a great job of cleaning my teeth, it feels like I just visited the dentist after each use. It does a great job of removing plaque and you find that you floss less because it cleans between the teeth so thoroughly.</li>
            <li> Great brush. I switched up from Sonicare after three years using the latter. Seems to be more effective with it&#x27;s rotating vibrations, and the whole thing is a bit more streamlined and easily stored. The charger is small and easy to use. One downside is the strange little hole in the shaft of the removable brush: It fills with water/toothpaste and leaves little white pools on the counter. Just rinse it more, you say? Ya, tried that. I even remove the top to rinse it out and it&#x27;s still an issue. That said, I still like it better than Sonicare (the vibrating is less intense and I use the sensitive brush head).</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush and you can&#x27;t beat the price, so it&#x27;s a great value.  You don&#x27;t need to apply any pressure...just let the brush do it&#x27;s job and it holds a charge very well.</li>
            <li> The charger on the toothbrush lasts 4-5 days if used twice a day. The charger is small and saves counter space.</li>
            <li> I bought one for myself and noticed a difference at the dentist office cleaning.  So I bought one for my husband and he loves it.</li>
            <li> Having an electric toothbrush is far superior to any manual toothbrush. Not only does it clean your teeth much better than a manual toothbrush, but it cleans without hurting your gums. My last oral b lasted for many years. That&#x27;s why I when I needed a replacement I bought another oral b</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve used Oral-B for years, accidentally left the charger in Florida so had to order two new ones. These are far better than the old model, which we thought was pretty terrific.</li>
            <li> Like the one I replaced it for, it has tendency to stall.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a Christmas gift for my bother who now wears braces. He loves this brush. He says it gives his teeth a deeper clean than a regular toothbrush. No complaints ;-)</li>
