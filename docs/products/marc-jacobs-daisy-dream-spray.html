            <li>, it&#x27;s just okay though .</li>
            <li>Such a good perfume!</li>
            <li>This is a fine scent.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the real deal at a much better price!</li>
            <li>It is summery and light.</li>
            <li>Its a genuine product from this seller.</li>
            <li>Very fresh light notes..</li>
            <li>Came super fast and such a great deal!</li>
            <li>If is the original product the smells disappear on 30 minutes I won&#x27;t buy it again .</li>
            <li>Fresh smelling, light perfume</li>

            <li>shipping was pretty quick too.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too soft and not to strong in smell.</li>
            <li>thank u so much!</li>
            <li>The amount of perfume you get here is more than the department store as I initially smelled it at Dillard&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>Appears to be the real deal and cheapeer!</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>

            <li>Would highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Fast  shipping.</li>
            <li>The scent is young enough for teenagers,  but sophisticated enough for grown ups.</li>
            <li>But I wanted to be honest as far as to other possible buyers.</li>
            <li>Exactly what you&#x27;d get in a big department store.</li>
            <li>I personally don&#x27;t mind that so much, so I probably could have hit the five star button.</li>

            <li> Always nervous to buy perfume on line but this is great...Fast delivery and smells great..thank u so much!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money i cannot smell anything.</li>
            <li> Bought for my wife at a good price. She really seems like like it.</li>
            <li> The bottle is very elegant and smells great.  Perfect gift for that special lady.</li>
            <li> Great fragrance! Great price! I was worried about ordering something like this on-line and it arriving broken.  This was packaged wonderfully and was just what my daughter wanted!  The beautiful bottle is just so lovely to look at as well!!!</li>
            <li> Such a good perfume! Would highly recommend! Fresh smelling, light perfume</li>
            <li> Another great spring/ summer fragrance.  Reminds me of a buttercup.  Floral, but not too heady.</li>
            <li> This perfume exceeds expectations.. It&#x27;s not too soft and not to strong in smell. Very fresh light notes.. A spring/ summer fragrance.. The amount of perfume you get here is more than the department store as I initially smelled it at Dillard&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> It was everything I&#x27;d hoped it would be and a bigger size than I thought.</li>
            <li> the perfume cannot last long.</li>
            <li> Ok! this is a lovely scent. I think I&#x27;d repurchase this one. I heard a lot about it, so I ordered it  without even smelling it. I got it in a timely manner, the bottle is adorable and good size, and the scent is so nice and light. I could do several sprays and not have it be over powering.The only reason why I did 4 stars vs. the 5, is because the scent does not last. You will get about 4hours use out of it, before you&#x27;d have to reapply it again. (at least on my skin, it might be different on yours). I personally don&#x27;t mind that so much, so I probably could have hit the five star button. But I wanted to be honest as far as to other possible buyers. I think the scent is fantastic, it&#x27;s very airy and fresh, with a florally scent mixed in it. Love it.</li>
            <li> Great price. Great product. Fast  shipping. Adequate packaging. A+ transaction..Thank you</li>
            <li> Love this perfume!&lt;br /&gt;Fast Shipping, absolutely best price and 100% a real perfume.&lt;br /&gt;So happy with my purchase!</li>

            <li> A fragrance that definitely wows him!!!</li>
            <li> Gift for someone and loved it.</li>
            <li> Fragrance is very weak and dissipates quickly. Not happy at all.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the real deal at a much better price! I was a little sceptical before ordering, but it&#x27;s legit. Smells great! No complaints whatsoever!</li>
            <li> Love it!!! Totally met my expectation!</li>
            <li> Appears to be the real deal and cheapeer!</li>
