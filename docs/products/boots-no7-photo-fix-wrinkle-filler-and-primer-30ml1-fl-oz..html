            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>Love this!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great and makes my face smooth and the make up</li>
            <li>Does an amazing job minimizing the appearance of wrinkles in between eyebrows and forehead.</li>
            <li>It makes your skin smooth and works great under your make up.</li>
            <li>Feels great and keeps your make-up on smooth and set.  </li>
            <li>Nice scent too.</li>
            <li>Has a nice non-greasy feel when applied</li>
            <li>The product is nice, as are all of the Boots No. 7 products...</li>
            <li>Very nice finish to to smooth out the lines and shadow any skin indentations.</li>
            <li>It applies very easily.  </li>
            <li>but it does create a flawless natural look.</li>
            <li>Just started using but very happy so far</li>
            <li>This is the first primer that I&#x27;ve been happy with.</li>
            <li>Will continue to purchase for sure.</li>
            <li>I love No7 products...</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>This primer made the concealer, which I love,</li>
            <li>(Yes, they use magic as a verb.)</li>
            <li>I put on top stays all day.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>This stuff is pretty amazing!  </li>
            <li>Nice and light.  </li>
            <li>Absolutely fabulous product!  </li>
            <li>I love it and will recommend it to all my friends.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Love all No. 7 products</li>
            <li>Did not expect miraculous results but am pleased with the softening effect it has on the lines at the corners of my eyes as well as the creases extending from nose to mouth.</li>
            <li>It gives me a brighter, more rested appearance.</li>
            <li>I love Boots 7 products</li>
            <li>She turned 30 and is more concerned with the quality of product she puts on her face.  </li>
            <li>Need to use it more to truly rate.</li>
            <li>It seem to work, love it.</li>
            <li>The thing I like best about the No. 7 Photo Fix is that it minimizes the &amp;#34;make-up settle&amp;#34; that builds up during the day in those lines, especially the ones on my forehead.</li>
            <li>It is more of a face cream,</li>
            <li>I love the way this product works under my makeup.</li>
            <li>Love the way this product makes my face feel.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>But I have to say this product rates as my favorite</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I think my makeup does stay on better....</li>
            <li>It feels as smooth as butter!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll continue to use :)</li>
            <li>Love the product, however, it came with a hole in it</li>
            <li>This stuff goes on very nicely and mutes the lines on my forehead immediately, as well as those other spots, and feels very nice on the skin.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t see much of a difference in my fine wrinkles, but it&#x27;s a great primer under make-up.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to use &amp; is refreshing to the skin.  </li>
            <li>yes it is smooth on the face---but they all are---not sure what all the hype is about--</li>
            <li>I do like this cream so smooth and makes my skin look better</li>
            <li>Another great Boots product..makes your skin really soft</li>
            <li>so it was more accessible .</li>
            <li>OMG you see the difference right away, I first wash my face, then put the PPPP cream on then a good moisturizer (I love</li>
            <li>Im sure this is great on younger skin...</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s fine.  </li>
            <li>All directions were followed, but still had wrinkles and fine lines, even with a lotion.</li>
            <li>One of my favoriteprimer,  it helps hide fine lines and wrinkles</li>
            <li>Smooth as silk.</li>
            <li>My make up went on smooth &amp; stayed on all day.  </li>
            <li>This is a fantastic skin-care line.</li>
            <li>I am age 65+ and am blessed with great skin but sagging is inevitable with age</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;pls send me a free bottle of each as a value customer and a xmas gift thank you in&lt;br /&gt;advance</li>
            <li>It makes my face smooth and makeup stays on all day.</li>
            <li>My skins feels so smooth and my makeup glides on.</li>
            <li>It allows for smooth, even make-up application.</li>
            <li>/&gt;it makes your foundation go on smoothly.</li>
            <li>It goes on buttery smooth and seems to enhance my foundation (No7 Lift &amp; Luminate Foundation SPF 15).  </li>
            <li>However, I am a big fan of Boots No7 Day Cream and Protect &amp; Perfect Intense Serum, and I use this product in conjunction with those; So maybe it&#x27;s a combination of all three that&#x27;s giving me the results</li>
            <li>I did not see a significant difference in the line filling either.</li>
            <li>Did nothing special to my face.</li>
            <li>There are light reflective components of this cream that lessen the appearance of wrinkles, and it is effective on fine lines but not so much on deep wrinkles.</li>
            <li>After using this product for one full week I have seen no difference in my skin.  </li>
            <li>The cream feels good on the face just started using it the only problem the tube is damaged there is a hole at the bottom of the tube hope it doesn&#x27;t evaporate</li>
            <li>Thanks :)</li>
            <li>The texture is exceptional and helps with foundation application, however, I don&#x27;t wear foundation on a daily basis.</li>
            <li>The cream absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>wow better than miracle blur from loreal will more really works</li>
            <li>I have some fine lines and such and this doesn&#x27;t really do much for those, but it goes on smooth and seems to be a nice primer before I put on my liquid foundation.</li>
            <li>so I thought it can&#x27;t be any good because Target is not a high end store right?  </li>
            <li>It does what it says it will do, its smooths out imperfections, i would recommended to any one who needs or wants smooth skin</li>
            <li>Well worth the the money for the results it gives you.</li>
            <li>Be sure to follow the directions - if you don&#x27;t apply it the way they direct it truly won&#x27;t work as well.</li>
            <li>I will not waste any more money on these products.</li>
            <li>I have been using this for the last 8 months, and I&#x27;ve really liked the results.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a nice filler for above the lips!</li>
            <li>So easy to apply, and makes skin look new and fresh.</li>
            <li>I then use Bare Minerals foundation, blush and Mineral Veil (a finishing powder) directly on top of the Photo Fix.</li>
            <li>so maybe they are all the same, but I saw an much more even look (and more natural</li>
            <li>Ok, after reading the description on the tube, I see that this is not a filler but a kind of &amp;#34;distracter&amp;#34; that is suppose to reflect the light and make the wrinkles APPEAR less deep.  </li>
            <li>It is great for those tiny lines on your upper lip.</li>
            <li>old, and have my fair share of lines &amp; wrinkles, but this is the first product I&#x27;ve found that actually fills them in !</li>
            <li>It really does exactly what it promises to do!</li>
            <li>After hearing about what a great product this is, how it is flying off the shelves and hard to find....I just had to try it!&lt;br</li>
            <li>Alone, it leaves your skin feeling velvety soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I have tried this item.</li>
            <li>But I love the finishing touch it puts on my daily make-up.</li>
            <li>But psychologically I feel better when I&#x27;m trying something.</li>
            <li>I know everyone is looking for anti-aging products that are worth it, but this one really is, imho.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m at the top end of 50 and work outside</li>
            <li>I did not expect this product to turn the clock back twenty years, so I am satisfied with the results.</li>
            <li>;)  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t look like I have &amp;#34;younger skin&amp;#34;, but I can definitely see a  more polished/refreshed look.  </li>
            <li>My face looks bright all day (almost pale).  </li>
            <li>Luckily I got a free sample from the local Duane Reade during a promotion.</li>
            <li>I use several other No. 7 products on my 60+ skin and they&#x27;re great.</li>
            <li>It fills in the lines very well and doesn&#x27;t move or slide off during the day which was something that Clarion Instant Smooth would do in humid or hot conditions.  </li>
            <li>also started using some new makeup brushes, but seems like this product would be more likely than a brush??</li>
            <li>Definitely seems to help with fine lines and wrinkles.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.  </li>
            <li>was ready to rave about it - huzzah.</li>
            <li>Really did not see much of difference, for the price would not buy again.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Maybe I was expecting too much from all the hype about this product</li>
            <li>it really is a product that, without a doubt, i will continue to purchase over and over again.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s very costly.</li>
            <li>I must admit that I don&#x27;t see a real difference in using this product.  </li>
            <li>I do not have wrinkles but this product makes my complection look smooth and much younger than I should be.</li>
            <li>Really didn&#x27;t give me the results I was looking for.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really believe it would polish off my wrinkles or lines, but I thought the remainder of my face it would fill in the pores or something and per what articles and TV said make it smoother looking.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a number of No 7 products and none of them really appealed to me at all.  </li>
            <li>Really like this product....</li>
            <li>This really seems to help with the wrinkles.  </li>
            <li>I put a pea-size amount on a finger tip and dot it over my wrinkles then gently distribute it in those areas.</li>
            <li>After hearing so  much hype, I figured I&#x27;d try a couple of the No. 7</li>
            <li>This produce line us half the cost of department cosmetics and works a whole lot better.  </li>
            <li>This product appeared on the &amp;#34;Doctors and had a decent rating.</li>
            <li>realistic expectations with what you buy.  </li>
            <li>I am 43 years old, and while I don&#x27;t have major wrinkles, I do see the signs of my fun life.</li>
            <li>it is a must have to feel complete and ready to greet the day and the stress that accompanies it.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t really make my skin feel soft.</li>
            <li>It gives my skin a glow making it look healthy and firm.  </li>
            <li>so I am always trying new products----I</li>
            <li>I previously used Clarion Instant Smooth which is very good but unfortunately discovered that they test on animals.  </li>
            <li>but when I started using it didn&#x27;t really see what the big whoop was.  </li>
            <li>This produce, despite all the hype, is completely ineffective on my skin.</li>
            <li>and I want to try the whole line of Boots No7, to see the totally effects.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m all about natural looking makeup.</li>
            <li>Makes  my face soft and young looking.</li>
            <li>I am liking this product so far...</li>
            <li>/&gt;(I hate that you require so many words in order to submit!!!)</li>
            <li>/&gt;highly recomend no mess, no stain and no fuss</li>
            <li>I have two reasonably well-defined forehead lines, small crows feet, smile lines, and lines that run from my nose to the corners of my mouth.</li>
            <li>Apparently, they were not a 68 year old woman.  </li>
            <li>First time user, At this time I&#x27;m not really noticing much difference with my lines, deep or not so deep.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have a hot face, like a chemical reaction, like I have with other products.</li>
            <li>Makes my skin feel very soft and smooth, but as a few others before mentioned it doesn&#x27;t last on the skin as long as I would like.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had this one long enough to really recommend it.</li>
            <li>While it doesn&#x27;t completely make them disappear it is an obvious improvement before and after application.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve tried all kinds of different foundations made for mature skin.</li>
            <li>I have mature skin and have tried numerous wrinkle creams.</li>
            <li>Okay, I haven&#x27;t used it very long, but it does seem to make my skin smoother - or at least it SEEMS to Look like it,&lt;br</li>
            <li>Just like any other face primer, really didn&#x27;t see any difference at all.</li>
            <li>Probably me, but the only thing thats gonna fix me for a photo is a shaky hand, low light and distance.  </li>

            <li> Very nice stuff.</li>
            <li> In two days, two people commented that my face was looking good.  </li>
            <li> Does a good job of smoothing the skin under make-up</li>
            <li> It also does a good job of hiding pores and making my finer lines disappear altogether.</li>
            <li> your makeup goes on flawless and smooth....</li>
            <li> you will be amazed at how good you look.</li>
            <li> Good prime</li>
            <li> I guess the price is fair for what it does.</li>
            <li> A good deal.</li>
            <li> Good even if your over 50.</li>
            <li> using your overnight revitalising, rich hydrating and protect &amp; perfect protection</li>
            <li> Quick shipping and wonderful product.</li>
            <li> Works but not that great and like most creams, takes a while.</li>
            <li> Okay, saw this on TV don&#x27;t remember in what context but looked like it worked great.  </li>
            <li> Love this product!</li>
            <li> Love it!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really in love with this product!  </li>
            <li> I love this product!</li>
            <li> Love this!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great and makes my face smooth and the make up</li>
            <li> Does an amazing job minimizing the appearance of wrinkles in between eyebrows and forehead.</li>
            <li> It makes your skin smooth and works great under your make up.</li>
            <li> Feels great and keeps your make-up on smooth and set.  </li>
            <li> Nice scent too.</li>
            <li> Has a nice non-greasy feel when applied</li>
            <li> The product is nice, as are all of the Boots No. 7 products...</li>
            <li> Very nice finish to to smooth out the lines and shadow any skin indentations.</li>
            <li> It applies very easily.  </li>
            <li> but it does create a flawless natural look.</li>
            <li> Just started using but very happy so far</li>
            <li> This is the first primer that I&#x27;ve been happy with.</li>
            <li> Will continue to purchase for sure.</li>
            <li> I love No7 products...</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> This primer made the concealer, which I love,</li>
            <li> (Yes, they use magic as a verb.)</li>
            <li> I put on top stays all day.  </li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> This stuff is pretty amazing!  </li>
            <li> Nice and light.  </li>
            <li> Absolutely fabulous product!  </li>
            <li> I love it and will recommend it to all my friends.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Love all No. 7 products</li>
            <li> Did not expect miraculous results but am pleased with the softening effect it has on the lines at the corners of my eyes as well as the creases extending from nose to mouth.</li>
            <li> It gives me a brighter, more rested appearance.</li>
            <li> I love Boots 7 products</li>
            <li> She turned 30 and is more concerned with the quality of product she puts on her face.  </li>
            <li> Need to use it more to truly rate.</li>
            <li> It seem to work, love it.</li>
            <li> The thing I like best about the No. 7 Photo Fix is that it minimizes the &amp;#34;make-up settle&amp;#34; that builds up during the day in those lines, especially the ones on my forehead.</li>
            <li> It is more of a face cream,</li>
            <li> I love the way this product works under my makeup.</li>
            <li> Love the way this product makes my face feel.</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> But I have to say this product rates as my favorite</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I think my makeup does stay on better....</li>
            <li> It feels as smooth as butter!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll continue to use :)</li>
            <li> Love the product, however, it came with a hole in it</li>
            <li> This stuff goes on very nicely and mutes the lines on my forehead immediately, as well as those other spots, and feels very nice on the skin.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see much of a difference in my fine wrinkles, but it&#x27;s a great primer under make-up.  </li>
            <li> It is easy to use &amp; is refreshing to the skin.  </li>
            <li> yes it is smooth on the face---but they all are---not sure what all the hype is about--</li>
            <li> I do like this cream so smooth and makes my skin look better</li>
            <li> Another great Boots product..makes your skin really soft</li>
            <li> so it was more accessible .</li>
            <li> OMG you see the difference right away, I first wash my face, then put the PPPP cream on then a good moisturizer (I love</li>
            <li> Im sure this is great on younger skin...</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s fine.  </li>
            <li> All directions were followed, but still had wrinkles and fine lines, even with a lotion.</li>
            <li> One of my favoriteprimer,  it helps hide fine lines and wrinkles</li>
            <li> Smooth as silk.</li>
            <li> My make up went on smooth &amp; stayed on all day.  </li>
            <li> This is a fantastic skin-care line.</li>
            <li> I am age 65+ and am blessed with great skin but sagging is inevitable with age</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;pls send me a free bottle of each as a value customer and a xmas gift thank you in&lt;br /&gt;advance</li>
            <li> It makes my face smooth and makeup stays on all day.</li>
            <li> My skins feels so smooth and my makeup glides on.</li>
            <li> It allows for smooth, even make-up application.</li>
            <li> /&gt;it makes your foundation go on smoothly.</li>
            <li> It goes on buttery smooth and seems to enhance my foundation (No7 Lift &amp; Luminate Foundation SPF 15).  </li>
            <li> However, I am a big fan of Boots No7 Day Cream and Protect &amp; Perfect Intense Serum, and I use this product in conjunction with those; So maybe it&#x27;s a combination of all three that&#x27;s giving me the results</li>
            <li> I did not see a significant difference in the line filling either.</li>
            <li> Did nothing special to my face.</li>
            <li> There are light reflective components of this cream that lessen the appearance of wrinkles, and it is effective on fine lines but not so much on deep wrinkles.</li>
            <li> After using this product for one full week I have seen no difference in my skin.  </li>
            <li> The cream feels good on the face just started using it the only problem the tube is damaged there is a hole at the bottom of the tube hope it doesn&#x27;t evaporate</li>
            <li> Thanks :)</li>
            <li> The texture is exceptional and helps with foundation application, however, I don&#x27;t wear foundation on a daily basis.</li>
            <li> The cream absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> wow better than miracle blur from loreal will more really works</li>
            <li> I have some fine lines and such and this doesn&#x27;t really do much for those, but it goes on smooth and seems to be a nice primer before I put on my liquid foundation.</li>
            <li> so I thought it can&#x27;t be any good because Target is not a high end store right?  </li>
            <li> It does what it says it will do, its smooths out imperfections, i would recommended to any one who needs or wants smooth skin</li>
            <li> Well worth the the money for the results it gives you.</li>
            <li> Be sure to follow the directions - if you don&#x27;t apply it the way they direct it truly won&#x27;t work as well.</li>
            <li> I will not waste any more money on these products.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for the last 8 months, and I&#x27;ve really liked the results.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a nice filler for above the lips!</li>
            <li> So easy to apply, and makes skin look new and fresh.</li>
            <li> I then use Bare Minerals foundation, blush and Mineral Veil (a finishing powder) directly on top of the Photo Fix.</li>
            <li> so maybe they are all the same, but I saw an much more even look (and more natural</li>
            <li> Ok, after reading the description on the tube, I see that this is not a filler but a kind of &amp;#34;distracter&amp;#34; that is suppose to reflect the light and make the wrinkles APPEAR less deep.  </li>
            <li> It is great for those tiny lines on your upper lip.</li>
            <li> old, and have my fair share of lines &amp; wrinkles, but this is the first product I&#x27;ve found that actually fills them in !</li>
            <li> It really does exactly what it promises to do!</li>
            <li> After hearing about what a great product this is, how it is flying off the shelves and hard to find....I just had to try it!&lt;br</li>
            <li> Alone, it leaves your skin feeling velvety soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have tried this item.</li>
            <li> But I love the finishing touch it puts on my daily make-up.</li>
            <li> But psychologically I feel better when I&#x27;m trying something.</li>
            <li> I know everyone is looking for anti-aging products that are worth it, but this one really is, imho.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m at the top end of 50 and work outside</li>
            <li> I did not expect this product to turn the clock back twenty years, so I am satisfied with the results.</li>
            <li> ;)  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t look like I have &amp;#34;younger skin&amp;#34;, but I can definitely see a  more polished/refreshed look.  </li>
            <li> My face looks bright all day (almost pale).  </li>
            <li> Luckily I got a free sample from the local Duane Reade during a promotion.</li>
            <li> I use several other No. 7 products on my 60+ skin and they&#x27;re great.</li>
            <li> It fills in the lines very well and doesn&#x27;t move or slide off during the day which was something that Clarion Instant Smooth would do in humid or hot conditions.  </li>
            <li> also started using some new makeup brushes, but seems like this product would be more likely than a brush??</li>
            <li> Definitely seems to help with fine lines and wrinkles.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  </li>
            <li> was ready to rave about it - huzzah.</li>
            <li> Really did not see much of difference, for the price would not buy again.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Maybe I was expecting too much from all the hype about this product</li>
            <li> it really is a product that, without a doubt, i will continue to purchase over and over again.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very costly.</li>
            <li> I must admit that I don&#x27;t see a real difference in using this product.  </li>
            <li> I do not have wrinkles but this product makes my complection look smooth and much younger than I should be.</li>
            <li> Really didn&#x27;t give me the results I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really believe it would polish off my wrinkles or lines, but I thought the remainder of my face it would fill in the pores or something and per what articles and TV said make it smoother looking.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a number of No 7 products and none of them really appealed to me at all.  </li>
            <li> Really like this product....</li>
            <li> This really seems to help with the wrinkles.  </li>
            <li> I put a pea-size amount on a finger tip and dot it over my wrinkles then gently distribute it in those areas.</li>
            <li> After hearing so  much hype, I figured I&#x27;d try a couple of the No. 7</li>
            <li> This produce line us half the cost of department cosmetics and works a whole lot better.  </li>
            <li> This product appeared on the &amp;#34;Doctors and had a decent rating.</li>
            <li> realistic expectations with what you buy.  </li>
            <li> I am 43 years old, and while I don&#x27;t have major wrinkles, I do see the signs of my fun life.</li>
            <li> it is a must have to feel complete and ready to greet the day and the stress that accompanies it.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t really make my skin feel soft.</li>
            <li> It gives my skin a glow making it look healthy and firm.  </li>
            <li> so I am always trying new products----I</li>
            <li> I previously used Clarion Instant Smooth which is very good but unfortunately discovered that they test on animals.  </li>
            <li> but when I started using it didn&#x27;t really see what the big whoop was.  </li>
            <li> This produce, despite all the hype, is completely ineffective on my skin.</li>
            <li> and I want to try the whole line of Boots No7, to see the totally effects.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m all about natural looking makeup.</li>
            <li> Makes  my face soft and young looking.</li>
            <li> I am liking this product so far...</li>
            <li> /&gt;(I hate that you require so many words in order to submit!!!)</li>
            <li> /&gt;highly recomend no mess, no stain and no fuss</li>
            <li> I have two reasonably well-defined forehead lines, small crows feet, smile lines, and lines that run from my nose to the corners of my mouth.</li>
            <li> Apparently, they were not a 68 year old woman.  </li>
            <li> First time user, At this time I&#x27;m not really noticing much difference with my lines, deep or not so deep.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a hot face, like a chemical reaction, like I have with other products.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel very soft and smooth, but as a few others before mentioned it doesn&#x27;t last on the skin as long as I would like.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had this one long enough to really recommend it.</li>
            <li> While it doesn&#x27;t completely make them disappear it is an obvious improvement before and after application.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve tried all kinds of different foundations made for mature skin.</li>
            <li> I have mature skin and have tried numerous wrinkle creams.</li>
            <li> Okay, I haven&#x27;t used it very long, but it does seem to make my skin smoother - or at least it SEEMS to Look like it,&lt;br</li>
            <li> Just like any other face primer, really didn&#x27;t see any difference at all.</li>
            <li> Probably me, but the only thing thats gonna fix me for a photo is a shaky hand, low light and distance.  </li>
            <li> I had seen this on TV a few times and had high expectations</li>
            <li> I will definitely continue to use this product as long as I can.</li>
            <li> this was purchase at the Target store in Garden City store in Long Island NY</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just a little more expensive.</li>
            <li> I apply over Roc moisturizer and give it a minute to set and dry.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 52 and have typical facial lines and crinkles for my age.</li>
            <li> /&gt;But my verdict is negative, because I cannot put this anywhere near my eyes.</li>
            <li> As expected.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not really a miracle cream.  </li>
            <li> I have only used this a few times.  </li>
            <li> guess I expected it to be thicker.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sticky and as other people have said, it&#x27;s heavily perfumed with something only your grandmother would like.</li>
            <li> Not big on deep changes, just subtle ones.  </li>
            <li> AND THERE WAS NO DIFFERENCE THAN THE OTHER SIDE</li>
            <li> BITING.&lt;br /&gt;IT DOES NOT DO ANYTHING THAT OTHER CREAMS DO NOT DO</li>
            <li> Almost gave a 4 stars due to the price, but compared to stuff my friends buy</li>
            <li> The applicator could dispense just a little less at at time, for my money, but that&#x27;s a minor quibble.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t surgery after all, but makes skin look like the wrinkles are less.  </li>
            <li> the way I see it, every little bit helps.  </li>
            <li> I just wasted my money ...</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make your skin look heavy.  </li>
            <li> Waste of time.  </li>
            <li> A waste of money.</li>
            <li> Too heavily perfumed</li>
            <li> I have quite a few products from this line.</li>
            <li> Maybe your experience will differ, otherwise it&#x27;s a waste of money.</li>
            <li> After applying the product and then my makeup I felt as though it made my face appear to pale.  </li>
            <li> I use it on my neck, without make up, where it softens those wrinkles that have begun to appear over the past few years.</li>
            <li> But the quantity is too little for the price!</li>
            <li> NOT worth the chase to find it!!  </li>
            <li> &amp; I didn&#x27;t have to use my powder like I usually do.  </li>
            <li> Not sure if I see a difference in wrinkle filler</li>
            <li> NO change from my usual primer</li>
            <li> but it is not magic as I read in some reviews.</li>
            <li> Also lazy when it comes to using a lot of products or makeup.  </li>
            <li> I am VERY picky about my make-up and usually end up disappointed after I find something I like, and they discontinue it.  </li>
            <li> It does &amp;#34;blur&amp;#34; the lines around my mouth, at least for a while</li>
            <li> This product has been getting a lot of hype from the news lately.  </li>
            <li> , it IS subtle, but it gives a smoothing effect.</li>
            <li> I have some crepiness under my eyes due to aging, and dark circles due primarily to terrible allergies</li>
            <li> However, my face has broken out some lately</li>
            <li> My base is the ultimate lazy, I just use Mac powder with a powder brush.  </li>
            <li> I have pretty awful marionette lines</li>
            <li> Christmas gift for my daughter who I;m encouraging to up her skin care game.  </li>
            <li> I quit using any of it because it always settles into the wrinkles and makes me look even worse.</li>
            <li> This \\&quot;filler\\&quot; does not fill wrinkles (mine are medium deep), but did seem to fill the pores on my nose and even out how my base applied.  </li>
            <li> The package is broken.</li>
            <li> I was not impressed at all.</li>
            <li> It difficult to find in a Target store because its out of stock.</li>
            <li> AND THE PRICE IS ABSURD.</li>
            <li> Wrong</li>
            <li> primer, this is not it, sorry folks.</li>
            <li> , I hate false advertising and Boots advertises this as a product that will &amp;#34;magic&amp;#34; away your wrinkles.</li>
            <li> does not work disappointed</li>
            <li> I was disappointed with this item.  </li>
            <li> I was very disappointed with the No 7 Photo Fix.  </li>
            <li> Used this once and found it awful.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I really like this product.  It works helping to conceal my under eye circles.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t tell any difference at all after using. I returned it and bought Primer from Clinique.</li>
            <li> I did not see any difference at all with this product---I have always taken care of my skin---so I am always trying new products----I tried No7 for 90 days---yes it is smooth on the face---but they all are---not sure what all the hype is about--someone got a lot of money for pushing this product---I am going back to my OLAY-----it does all this too---whatever that means---</li>
            <li> This product is ALL that it says it is. Will continue to purchase for sure. I love No7 products...Excellent for sure!</li>
            <li> As expected. Used it before.</li>
            <li> does not work disappointed</li>
            <li> Love this product! I don&#x27;t see much of a difference in my fine wrinkles, but it&#x27;s a great primer under make-up.  Alone, it leaves your skin feeling velvety soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> Love this product. I will definitely keep this in my makeup bag. Great job, No. 7!!!!</li>
            <li> This produce line us half the cost of department cosmetics and works a whole lot better.  In two days, two people commented that my face was looking good.  I am hooked  and so is my husband on the mens&#x27; line</li>
            <li> Too soon to tell difference</li>
            <li> Luckily I got a free sample from the local Duane Reade during a promotion. The texture is exceptional and helps with foundation application, however, I don&#x27;t wear foundation on a daily basis. So I experimented and used it under my under eye concealer, which I do use every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was ready to rave about it - huzzah. This primer made the concealer, which I love, even better!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But 5 minutes later my eyes were tearing. It&#x27;s not the concealer. I&#x27;ve worn that without a problem for months. It must be this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This might not happen with you. Try to get a sample and see what happens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But my verdict is negative, because I cannot put this anywhere near my eyes. It&#x27;s useless and I&#x27;m glad I paid nothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I hate false advertising and Boots advertises this as a product that will &amp;#34;magic&amp;#34; away your wrinkles. (Yes, they use magic as a verb.) Shame on Boots.</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful. Smooth as silk. My foundation goes on perfect.&lt;br /&gt;Love it!</li>
            <li> Great primer, cant do without it.</li>
            <li> Ok, after reading the description on the tube, I see that this is not a filler but a kind of &amp;#34;distracter&amp;#34; that is suppose to reflect the light and make the wrinkles APPEAR less deep.  I&#x27;ll go for anything that will help but I didn&#x27;t like that it was described as a filler and that is not what it says on the actual product. The cream absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great and makes my face smooth and the make up I put on top stays all day.  My face looks bright all day (almost pale).  Being south east asian the lighter the skin looks the prettier it is considered!  But the quantity is too little for the price!</li>
            <li> Excellent coffee - just that</li>
            <li> The smell is so over powering I couldn&#x27;t stand to have it on my face.  I did not see a significant difference in the line filling either.</li>
            <li> Great primer fir the price. Nice scent too.</li>
            <li> Really did not see much of difference, for the price would not buy again.&lt;br /&gt;Maybe I was expecting too much from all the hype about this product</li>
            <li> Great product!!!! Well worth the the money for the results it gives you. No need to spend a lot of money to heart great results.</li>
            <li> I had seen this on TV a few times and had high expectations but when I started using it didn&#x27;t really see what the big whoop was.  I was not impressed at all.</li>
            <li> Does an amazing job minimizing the appearance of wrinkles in between eyebrows and forehead. While it doesn&#x27;t completely make them disappear it is an obvious improvement before and after application. Be sure to follow the directions - if you don&#x27;t apply it the way they direct it truly won&#x27;t work as well.</li>
            <li> wow better than miracle blur from loreal will more really works</li>
            <li> So easy to apply, and makes skin look new and fresh.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have tried this item. I have used No7 products before. I haven&#x27;t had this one long enough to really recommend it.</li>
            <li> I would not buy this product again. I saw no improvement in my skin that this product said would happen.</li>
            <li> My wife has used this products for several years. It difficult to find in a Target store because its out of stock. Ordered on line.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my mom who likes it but it&#x27;s not really a miracle cream.  Not big on deep changes, just subtle ones.  Works but not that great and like most creams, takes a while.</li>
            <li> what can i say?  i am a repeat costomer when it comes to purchasing this product.  it really is a product that, without a doubt, i will continue to purchase over and over again.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed with the No 7 Photo Fix.  After using this product for one full week I have seen no difference in my skin.  I would not recommend this product to anyone.  I just wasted my money ... it&#x27;s very costly.</li>
            <li> I caught a story on this product on a talk show and had to try it. I love it. It is not suppose to make your wrinkles disappear only the rewinding of the clock can do that. But I love the finishing touch it puts on my daily make-up. It&#x27;s like framing your face the way you want it to stay for the entire day. For me ( And I am in my 50&#x27;s) it is a must have to feel complete and ready to greet the day and the stress that accompanies it.</li>
            <li> This stuff is pretty amazing!  It does &amp;#34;blur&amp;#34; the lines around my mouth, at least for a while</li>
            <li> Definitely seems to help with fine lines and wrinkles.</li>
            <li> This stuff goes on very nicely and mutes the lines on my forehead immediately, as well as those other spots, and feels very nice on the skin. The applicator could dispense just a little less at at time, for my money, but that&#x27;s a minor quibble.</li>
            <li> I have pretty awful marionette lines&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think anything short of a miracle would help diminish them. But psychologically I feel better when I&#x27;m trying something.</li>
            <li> The cream feels good on the face just started using it the only problem the tube is damaged there is a hole at the bottom of the tube hope it doesn&#x27;t evaporate</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make your skin look heavy.  Nice and light.  Love it!  Would recommend to a friend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(I hate that you require so many words in order to submit!!!)</li>
            <li> Absolutely fabulous product!  It really does exactly what it promises to do!</li>
            <li> This is a GREAT product! I didn&#x27;t think there could be such a noticeable difference in make up, it IS subtle, but it gives a smoothing effect. Excellent vendor!</li>
            <li> This produce, despite all the hype, is completely ineffective on my skin. I may as well put Crisco on my face.</li>
            <li> This is awesome stuff but, I wish the bottle was bigger.</li>
            <li> Just started using this so I&#x27;m hoping it will be as great as the day and night cream</li>
            <li> Christmas gift for my daughter who I;m encouraging to up her skin care game.  We all age and we gotta take care care of these candles God gave us or they will burn up!  She hasn&#x27;t reported to me how she likes this, but she lives several states away.  I use several other No. 7 products on my 60+ skin and they&#x27;re great.</li>
            <li> It does what it says it will do, its smooths out imperfections, i would recommended to any one who needs or wants smooth skin</li>
            <li> The best cream ever, I wolud recomend this if you have a specual occasion or every day.  Grest team. Great</li>
            <li> Okay, I haven&#x27;t used it very long, but it does seem to make my skin smoother - or at least it SEEMS to Look like it,&lt;br /&gt;Which is all you can ask of a cream.  It isn&#x27;t surgery after all, but makes skin look like the wrinkles are less.  I call that a win.</li>
            <li> I love this product!!!! My make up went on smooth &amp; stayed on all day.  I have oily skin &amp; I didn&#x27;t have to use my powder like I usually do.  It evened out my skin tone. I will definitely continue to use this product as long as I can.</li>
            <li> Seems to be another product that doesn&#x27;t work. I will not waste any more money on these products. So save yours too!</li>
            <li> It gives my skin a glow making it look healthy and firm.  I love it and will recommend it to all my friends.</li>
            <li> Quick shipping and wonderful product. Thanks :)</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t get results as stated.</li>
            <li> I CANNOT TELL ANY DIFFERENCE IN MY SKIN AT ALL!I DONE ONE SIDE OF MY FACE AND THERE WAS NO DIFFERENCE THAN THE OTHER SIDE</li>
            <li> I must admit that I don&#x27;t see a real difference in using this product.  However, I am a big fan of Boots No7 Day Cream and Protect &amp; Perfect Intense Serum, and I use this product in conjunction with those; So maybe it&#x27;s a combination of all three that&#x27;s giving me the results I see???&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So the way I see it, every little bit helps.  This is a fantastic skin-care line.</li>
            <li> Have been using it for a while.  Does a good job of smoothing the skin under make-up</li>
            <li> Wonderful stuff.  All their products work well for me.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t that impressed.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t see a visible difference as the advertising claims.</li>
            <li> I do like this cream so smooth and makes my skin look better</li>
            <li> great, my friends are asking me to get them some!</li>
            <li> I do not have wrinkles but this product makes my complection look smooth and much younger than I should be. If you know what I am talking about. It makes my make up look flawless. Love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really in love with this product!  I know everyone is looking for anti-aging products that are worth it, but this one really is, imho.</li>
            <li> After applying the product and then my makeup I felt as though it made my face appear to pale.  Really didn&#x27;t give me the results I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Love all No. 7 products</li>
            <li> I am age 65+ and am blessed with great skin but sagging is inevitable with age so I tried Boots No7. Did not expect miraculous results but am pleased with the softening effect it has on the lines at the corners of my eyes as well as the creases extending from nose to mouth. It gives me a brighter, more rested appearance.</li>
            <li> WAY OVER-PRICED FOR WHAT IT DELIVERS. SHAME ON ME FOR BITING.&lt;br /&gt;IT DOES NOT DO ANYTHING THAT OTHER CREAMS DO NOT DO AND THE PRICE IS ABSURD.</li>
            <li> I love Boots 7 products</li>
            <li> Okay, saw this on TV don&#x27;t remember in what context but looked like it worked great.  Also saw it in a magazine with great reviews.  Apparently, they were not a 68 year old woman.  I didn&#x27;t really believe it would polish off my wrinkles or lines, but I thought the remainder of my face it would fill in the pores or something and per what articles and TV said make it smoother looking.  Not so.  It did zip.  Waste of time.  I&#x27;ve tried a number of No 7 products and none of them really appealed to me at all.  Hype in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;And this product did not fill in the wrinkles I do have and did nothing at all.  A waste of money.</li>
            <li> I purchased Boots at my daughter-in-law&#x27;s request for her birthday last January.  She turned 30 and is more concerned with the quality of product she puts on her face.  She loves it!</li>
            <li> I have only used this a few times.  Need to use it more to truly rate.</li>
            <li> Hole in tube means I can&#x27;t carry it with me</li>
            <li> It seem to work, love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 52 and have typical facial lines and crinkles for my age. I have two reasonably well-defined forehead lines, small crows feet, smile lines, and lines that run from my nose to the corners of my mouth. And some dimple lines. The thing I like best about the No. 7 Photo Fix is that it minimizes the &amp;#34;make-up settle&amp;#34; that builds up during the day in those lines, especially the ones on my forehead. It also does a good job of hiding pores and making my finer lines disappear altogether. I use it on my neck, without make up, where it softens those wrinkles that have begun to appear over the past few years. I apply over Roc moisturizer and give it a minute to set and dry. I then use Bare Minerals foundation, blush and Mineral Veil (a finishing powder) directly on top of the Photo Fix. This is the first primer that I&#x27;ve been happy with.</li>
            <li> You might as well just smear glue on your face. It&#x27;s sticky and as other people have said, it&#x27;s heavily perfumed with something only your grandmother would like. They need to pull this off the shelf. What were they thinking?</li>
            <li> Really like this product....but cheaper at Walgreens</li>
            <li> fades away those tiny wrinkles around eyes, mouth, nose. I have been using it for a couple years now. It is great for those tiny lines on your upper lip.</li>
            <li> Very nice stuff. Makes my skin feel very soft and smooth, but as a few others before mentioned it doesn&#x27;t last on the skin as long as I would like.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ll recomend it to every one i have contact with&lt;br /&gt;i heard of in on the view channel 7 ABC&lt;br /&gt;highly recomend no mess, no stain and no fuss&lt;br /&gt;love the way it make my face look,i&#x27;m staying away&lt;br /&gt;from powder/liquid make up&lt;br /&gt;i&#x27;m using your overnight revitalising, rich hydrating and protect &amp; perfect protection&lt;br /&gt;all this was purchase at the Target store in Garden City store in Long Island NY&lt;br /&gt;pls send me a free bottle of each as a value customer and a xmas gift thank you in&lt;br /&gt;advance i&#x27;ll always used this product</li>
            <li> I was disappointed with this item.  It is more of a face cream, guess I expected it to be thicker.</li>
            <li> I might as well have had regular hand lotion on my face.  This done aboslutely nothing for me.</li>
            <li> II like this product... Seems as a Primer. Not sure if I see a difference in wrinkle filler</li>
            <li> I love the way this product works under my makeup. It makes my face smooth and makeup stays on all day. Not greasy at all.</li>
            <li> Very nice finish to to smooth out the lines and shadow any skin indentations.</li>
            <li> Love the way this product makes my face feel.</li>
            <li> Did nothing special to my face.Save your money!</li>
            <li> I have been hearing about Boots #7 products for years, on TV, in magazines etc but never tried it because they sell it at Target....TARGET, not Macy&#x27;s or Dillards, so I thought it can&#x27;t be any good because Target is not a high end store right?  Wrong I ordered it on Amazon after seeing it once again on a make over show.  It is awesome...your makeup goes on flawless and smooth....I also ordered the #7 Protect &amp; Perfect Protection &amp; Perfection cream because I am getting some wrinkles around my mouth...OMG you see the difference right away, I first wash my face, then put the PPPP cream on then a good moisturizer (I love Clinique&#x27;s moisture surge thirst relief) let it sink in then put the #7 Primer on...then your foundation.  Perfectly&lt;br /&gt;Beautiful....you will be amazed at how good you look.</li>
            <li> NO change from my usual primer i&#x27;m sill searching for the perfect face  primer, this is not it, sorry folks.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a miracle worker but it works for me. I&#x27;m 50 something and I&#x27;ve tried all kinds of different foundations made for mature skin. I quit using any of it because it always settles into the wrinkles and makes me look even worse. Then I discovered this and Boots tinted moisturizer and I love it. No, the wrinkles don&#x27;t disappear. Nothing short of a face lift or botox will do that but it does create a flawless natural look. I love it.</li>
            <li> Good prime but it is not magic as I read in some reviews.</li>
            <li> This really seems to help with the wrinkles.  It is easy to use &amp; is refreshing to the skin.  I am impressed with it.</li>
            <li> I love this product! My skins feels so smooth and my makeup glides on. I have mature skin and have tried numerous wrinkle creams. But I have to say this product rates as my favorite</li>
            <li> was squished under pans and out of box so some leaked out</li>
            <li> I will buy this product again and I want to try the whole line of Boots No7, to see the totally effects.</li>
            <li> Great Product. Happy with the results.</li>
            <li> Too heavily perfumed and I don&#x27;t see any difference in my skin. It doesn&#x27;t really make my skin feel soft. I don&#x27;t get it? I&#x27;m a 41 yo woman.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. Wish I could find it in the local Rite Aid so it was more accessible .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m at the top end of 50 and work outside so I&#x27;m all about natural looking makeup. Also lazy when it comes to using a lot of products or makeup.  This \\&quot;filler\\&quot; does not fill wrinkles (mine are medium deep), but did seem to fill the pores on my nose and even out how my base applied.  My base is the ultimate lazy, I just use Mac powder with a powder brush.  I&#x27;ve never used a primer before so maybe they are all the same, but I saw an much more even look (and more natural if anything) after applying. Has a nice non-greasy feel when applied and I only waited about 10 seconds before brushing on my powder afterwards. Almost gave a 4 stars due to the price, but compared to stuff my friends buy I guess the price is fair for what it does.</li>
            <li> This product has been getting a lot of hype from the news lately.  I tried it.  it&#x27;s fine.  It&#x27;s consistency is great,  I just feel like there is not a lot of product in the container.  I&#x27;ve used it a handful of times.  I think my makeup does stay on better.... but still on the fence about a repurchase.  I like Laura Mercier.  It&#x27;s just a little more expensive.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think this primer hid all my wrinkles and lines on my face as well as it was touted to do.&lt;br /&gt;Supposedly, all the stars use it on the &amp;#34;red carpet&amp;#34;!</li>
            <li> After hearing about what a great product this is, how it is flying off the shelves and hard to find....I just had to try it!&lt;br /&gt;So NOT worth the chase to find it!!  Just like any other face primer, really didn&#x27;t see any difference at all.</li>
            <li> I saw a comparison of this stuff. I thought I&#x27;d try it. I currently use: Olay, Roc &amp; Costco&#x27;s anti-wrinkle cream &amp; this stuff works with all of these products. I don&#x27;t have a hot face, like a chemical reaction, like I have with other products.</li>
            <li> You can not lose w/this product. A good deal. I will order again.</li>
            <li> First time user, At this time I&#x27;m not really noticing much difference with my lines, deep or not so deep.</li>
            <li> Love this! Plan to reorder.</li>
            <li> The operative words in the name of this product are &amp;#34;photo&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;filler&amp;#34;. The manufacturer does not claim that this product removes wrinkles, so no one should order it expecting a miracle.  There are light reflective components of this cream that lessen the appearance of wrinkles, and it is effective on fine lines but not so much on deep wrinkles. I put a pea-size amount on a finger tip and dot it over my wrinkles then gently distribute it in those areas. I did not expect this product to turn the clock back twenty years, so I am satisfied with the results. If your wrinkles are deep, you probably need to use Retin A rather than Boots No. 7.</li>
            <li> I have some crepiness under my eyes due to aging, and dark circles due primarily to terrible allergies so I need to use a lot of concealer.  I previously used Clarion Instant Smooth which is very good but unfortunately discovered that they test on animals.  I tried this hoping it would work as well and it does.  It fills in the lines very well and doesn&#x27;t move or slide off during the day which was something that Clarion Instant Smooth would do in humid or hot conditions.  I am very happy with this product&#x27;s performance and the companies position on animal testing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT:  I wanted to clarify that I only use this under and around my eyes.  I do not apply this as an all over primer.</li>
            <li> The package is broken.</li>
            <li> This product appeared on the &amp;#34;Doctors and had a decent rating. However, did not worked as promised nor as advertised on the bottle. All directions were followed, but still had wrinkles and fine lines, even with a lotion.</li>
            <li> Very good product.  I have quite a few products from this line.</li>
            <li> I just started using this product.  It applies very easily.  It feels as smooth as butter!  It allows for smooth, even make-up application.</li>
            <li> One of my favoriteprimer,  it helps hide fine lines and wrinkles</li>
            <li> I have been using this for the last 8 months, and I&#x27;ve really liked the results. It makes your skin smooth and works great under your make up. Good even if your over 50.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 74 yrs. old, and have my fair share of lines &amp; wrinkles, but this is the first product I&#x27;ve found that actually fills them in ! Plus,&lt;br /&gt;it makes your foundation go on smoothly. The very best product of it&#x27;s kind on the market !! I will never be without it from now on!</li>
            <li> The product is nice, as are all of the Boots No. 7 products...it&#x27;s a nice filler for above the lips!</li>
            <li> Used this once and found it awful.</li>
            <li> Just started using but very happy so far</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m now a BOOTS girl.  I am VERY picky about my make-up and usually end up disappointed after I find something I like, and they discontinue it.  After hearing so  much hype, I figured I&#x27;d try a couple of the No. 7 products.&lt;br /&gt;This product is great.  I am 43 years old, and while I don&#x27;t have major wrinkles, I do see the signs of my fun life. ;)  It goes on buttery smooth and seems to enhance my foundation (No7 Lift &amp; Luminate Foundation SPF 15).  I don&#x27;t look like I have &amp;#34;younger skin&amp;#34;, but I can definitely see a  more polished/refreshed look.  I&#x27;m very happy with it!  (I also use No7 Restore and Renew Night Cream - which has done wonders to even out my skin tone!)&lt;br /&gt;Have realistic expectations with what you buy.  It&#x27;s not a facelift in a tube, it&#x27;s a primer.  I&#x27;ll continue to use :)</li>
            <li> Feels great and keeps your make-up on smooth and set.  My make-up lasts a lot longer with this.  I use it in combination with Boots Intelligent Balance Mousse Foundation. Boots is awesome.</li>
            <li> Love the product, however, it came with a hole in it and I had to return it.  I have used it before and am happy with it.</li>
            <li> As described and delivered on time</li>
            <li> Makes  my face soft and young looking. I can tell the difference when I don&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li> Probably me, but the only thing thats gonna fix me for a photo is a shaky hand, low light and distance.  Im sure this is great on younger skin...but for me, I couldn&#x27;t tell the difference.</li>
            <li> I am liking this product so far... I was at Target and planned to purchase the ELF primer, but this caught my eye. I have some fine lines and such and this doesn&#x27;t really do much for those, but it goes on smooth and seems to be a nice primer before I put on my liquid foundation. However, my face has broken out some lately and this might be the culprit... also started using some new makeup brushes, but seems like this product would be more likely than a brush??</li>
            <li> Works great with the serum. I see a difference especially when I wear makeup.</li>
            <li> Cannot tell any difference whatsoever</li>
            <li> Another great Boots product..makes your skin really soft</li>
            <li> I should have paid attention to some reviews I read saying this stuff doesn&#x27;t work............it doesn&#x27;t work!  Maybe your experience will differ, otherwise it&#x27;s a waste of money.</li>
    </ol>
