            <li>a little goes a long way and this jar is huge!</li>
            <li>, skin is much less red, just a tiny bit itchy from peeling skin on my chest, but even the nipple is looking better and</li>
            <li>and it didn&#x27;t do as much as this stuff did in the first few days of use.  </li>
            <li>First day since my needle biopsy in february that I am starting to feel human again....</li>
            <li>He skin is lightening and back to a normal texture.</li>
            <li>I tried many products as recommended by doctors and radiation discussion boards, but my poor sensitive skin still reacted extremely with burning and folliculitis after only 10 treatments.  </li>

            <li> He skin is lightening and back to a normal texture.</li>
            <li> I tried many products as recommended by doctors and radiation discussion boards, but my poor sensitive skin still reacted extremely with burning and folliculitis after only 10 treatments.  </li>
            <li> I did get a sample from the radiation oncologist, along with a few other type creams, unfortunately I went with the free stuff and didn&#x27;t purchase this right away.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only thing that gets rid of the dry flakiness on my legs.</li>
            <li> My skin is only slightly pink, with no sores.  </li>
            <li> use it from head to toe on myself and my daughter to help with everyhitng from dry skin to excema, blemishes and chapped lips.</li>
            <li> Helped with the dry itchy skin.</li>
            <li> I strongly recommend this cream, if using from the start I would certainly never had such a bad reaction.  </li>
            <li> my advice is keep using it everyday several times a day before you have your reconstruction.</li>
            <li> a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> After breast surgery, the radiation nurses recommended a greasy salve to keep the radiation burns down on my wife&#x27;s breasts.</li>
            <li> I use it on my face as a moisturizer, and have no more irritation or dry spots.  </li>
            <li> Itching is slight and goes away after I apply this cream.  </li>
            <li> My radiologist switched me to this cream half way through my 30 treatments in the hopes that it would help my skin to avoid burning while I had breast radiation.  </li>
            <li> has reduced dramatically after less than a week.  </li>
            <li> a few applications of this or when she seems to get read</li>
            <li> Skin tightened up and dried out.</li>
            <li> 19 treatments in, I was prescribed the Silvadine prescription cream, this helped very little.  </li>
            <li> I never thought that poor thing would survive much less speak to me ever.  </li>
            <li> In addition, it is less expensive than Miaderm.</li>
            <li> It was nothing but glorified petroleum jelly and very thick and greasy.  </li>
            <li> , I figured it couldn&#x27;t get any worse.</li>
            <li> While undergoing 4 weeks of radiation for DCIS, My Girls Cream kept my skin moisturized and less painful.  </li>
            <li> By then I already had raw patches, folliculitus and severely painful allover.</li>
            <li> The skin under my arms and breast had burned and tightened so badly that I could hardly move my arm.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I had no knowledge about this cream months ago when I was going through radiation.</li>
            <li> I have had no burning sensation and the skin has just now turned faintly tan.  </li>
            <li> I was so desperate</li>
            <li> This is very expensive, and in the end my doctors did not put it on the to-buy list.</li>
            <li> In the end, I did burn, BUT I think my burn was not as bad as it could have been.  </li>
            <li> My doctors had recommended Aquafor which I found very disappointing.  </li>

            <li> I have throat cancer and was told my skin would be very red and sore.  From day one, my sister sent me this cream and I have used it every day.  My skin is only slightly pink, with no sores.  This cream is terrific and soothing.  I highly recommend it to anyone going through cancer treatment for anywhere on your body!</li>
            <li> I used My Girls Cream throughout my 7 week raditaion treatment.  My Dr and the radiation techs always commented on how good my skin looked.  I was able to complete treatment without any breaks and within a week or two of completing treatment my skin was normal.  Highly recommend this product to anyone getting ready for radiation.</li>
            <li> Excellent cream during radiation treatment....easy to apply, subtle scent ...I would recommend this cream to anyone undergoing radiation to the breast.</li>
            <li> Great in my radiation burned skin. Very soothing!</li>
            <li> The BEST cream when going through radiation treatment. It has no smell, it does not stain and is easy and mess free to apply! I continued to use it after I had completed treatment.</li>
            <li> AMAZING PRODUCT! My mother introduced it to me as she uses it for her skin afer radiation.. .I use it from head to toe on myself and my daughter to help with everyhitng from dry skin to excema, blemishes and chapped lips. Gentle healing and Godsent product. First application stings but relieves at the same time, but after that you get used to it and it no longer does when you apply. I noticed a difference the moment it set on my skin.. Its so gentle and it helped heal my 3 year old daughters stubborn yeast infection...Even the doctors had not idea what to do because nothing was working.. a few applications of this or when she seems to get read and it clears...&lt;br /&gt;Multi-functional and the best brand out there... Highly reccomend and have purches two so far! Note... a little goes a long way and this jar is huge!</li>
            <li> This cream has no odor and goes on smoothly and soothes red skin.  It absorbs but still leaves your skin feeling soft and moist.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using My girls about a week or so.  It has exceeded my expectations of a good skin cream.</li>
            <li> I am forcing myself to rate this for you. My skin looked good and semi-normal, and I did mix it with Aveeno. This is very expensive, and in the end my doctors did not put it on the to-buy list. You can try it, and if it does not work you may send it back. Good luck with your treatment.</li>
            <li> I used this cream during radiation and was extremely satisfied with the results! This cream has a whipped like texture and is so easy to apply versus some of the other recommended creams which were quite greasy. I highly recommend this cream. It got me through seven weeks of radiation for breast cancer</li>
            <li> While undergoing radiation treatment for breast cancer, I bought this product. My doctor told me not to use it and instead use only Miaderm. I used Miaderm, but when my burns became severe, it provided no relief. The skin under my arms and breast had burned and tightened so badly that I could hardly move my arm. That&#x27;s when I decided to give this cream a try. I was so desperate, I figured it couldn&#x27;t get any worse. I used this cream and saw relief within FOUR DAYS, applying it in the morning and at night. It softened my burned skin and allowed me a little more flexibility, in addition to promoting healing. In addition, it is less expensive than Miaderm. I am glad that I purchased this product!</li>
            <li> I have received 33 radiation treatments and my  Physicians office couldn&#x27;t believe how well my breast looked. I didn&#x27;t blister or have any severe  skin sloughing .Great cream I highly recommend for breast caner patients to use or anyone receiving radiation treatments.</li>
            <li> This cream was recommended when I went through radiation for breast cancer.  It has worked better than anything else I have used.  I highly recommend it for any part of your body.  It&#x27;s the only thing that gets rid of the dry flakiness on my legs.</li>
            <li> I researched this product and read reviews which were exact.  I have been dong radiation for four weeks now and have found this product to be very soothing.  Also, my techs commented on the good condition of my skin.  I have two more intensive weeks to go and am hoping this cream will continue to do the job.  I just received my second order as I am not sparing it..........put it on like three or four times after treatment and a couple of times in the morning before I go to work.</li>
            <li> My breast didn&#x27;t even look radiated after it healed up and I credit this cream!!  I LOVE IT!! NON-TOXIC and it smells great what more can you ask for.. my advice is keep using it everyday several times a day before you have your reconstruction. It really keeps your skin and tissue soft!!</li>
            <li> Better Late Than Never. Great Find. Unfortunately I had no knowledge about this cream months ago when I was going through radiation. I had jaw cancer. My face, head, neck and chest are SCORCHED.  I recently found this on Amazon. Thanks to the reviewers I decided to buy it. I have only used it one day so far and the results are amazing. I now have hopes that I can get my skin feeling better again. I even use it on my scalp. Wow. It is helping so much, in just one day.&lt;br /&gt;Years ago I used Calendula cream for an injury on my Bassett Hound&#x27;s paw. Never thought to use it with radiation therapy.</li>
            <li> My Girls Cream was recommended by a nurse at one of our local cancer hospitals.  I used it to keep moist a skin graft and the location of 30 days of radiation.  It worked better than two other creams and met all the praise bestowed on it by one of the nurses in the radiation area of the hospital.</li>
            <li> In preparation for radiation I researched creams and lotions.  My doctors had recommended Aquafor which I found very disappointing.  It was nothing but glorified petroleum jelly and very thick and greasy.  The breast must be clean every day for treatment and I didn&#x27;t want to be scrubbing that stuff off a sensitive area.  I found numerous testimonials for My Girls Cream so purchased this product and began using it for a week before radiation treatments.  According to my technicians and doctors I&#x27;ve had an excellent response after 28 treatments to the entire breast from collarbone to below breast and from underarm to sternum.  I have had no burning sensation and the skin has just now turned faintly tan.  Itching is slight and goes away after I apply this cream.  The cream is wonderfully soothing and melts into the skin leaving no residue.  I apply it 3 or 4 times a day and before treatment I gently wash the area with baby body wash.  I highly recommend this product and will continue to use it after I&#x27;m done with my radiation.</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin, and this product is wonderful.  I use it on my face as a moisturizer, and have no more irritation or dry spots.  I highly recommend it -- a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> I had a lot of pain during the five week course of radiation. Actually My Girls Cream did not help it at all. It was a soothing, comfortable cream on areas of my body that really had no problem with pain. However, as a help to radiation pain and burning it was of no help.</li>
            <li> After breast surgery, the radiation nurses recommended a greasy salve to keep the radiation burns down on my wife&#x27;s breasts. It stained the sheets and her nightgown. I read the review of this product and ordered a jar. It has worked wonders and we are still using it. The best part is the loving care I use when applying it to her.</li>
            <li> This was a gift.  I got reports back that it was gentle and soothing.  It really helped her radiation burns and got all the doctor&#x27;s approval to use it.  I&#x27;d definitely use/give this as a gift again.</li>
            <li> Ive been taking radiation treatments for breast cancer and my skin has held up great! No blistering, breaks or peeling. My radiologist even had me bring it in and he has already recommended it to another patient!</li>
            <li> Good cream, nothing great, I think it is overpriced!</li>
            <li> I am quite pleased with this item.</li>
            <li> My friend has breast cancer. This cream was recommended by her physician, to use on her skin after radiation.  It helps to prevent blistering.  It was a get well gift to her.  My friend believes in the product.</li>
            <li> While undergoing 4 weeks of radiation for DCIS, My Girls Cream kept my skin moisturized and less painful.  It was very helpful to my recovery.  I am still using it, 2 weeks after radiation ended, but  I think I will only need it for a few more days.  It is very mild and goes on smoothly and does not leave any stains or odor on clothes.</li>
            <li> I am currently going through radiation for breast cancer.  I tried many products as recommended by doctors and radiation discussion boards, but my poor sensitive skin still reacted extremely with burning and folliculitis after only 10 treatments.  19 treatments in, I was prescribed the Silvadine prescription cream, this helped very little.  I googled radiation creams and found My girls, read the reviews and ordered it.  I have used it for a week now and my folliculitis is gone and the skin is beginning to soften up and looks and feels much better.  I strongly recommend this cream, if using from the start I would certainly never had such a bad reaction.  Totally worth the price and it really works.</li>
            <li> I love this cream! It&#x27;s organic, odorless, dries quickly, and I can wear a silk blouse immediately with no worries about stains. It&#x27;s highly recommended for women undergoing radiation for breast cancer. My skin never looked better.</li>
            <li> I love this skin cream. I use it as moisturizer every day, morning and night. It&#x27;s not greasy, feels light, yet I definitely feel like my skin is smooth and soft. When I had a sunburn I put it on 2-3 times a day and it made my skin feel as if it never happened. I hope they never stop making it!</li>
            <li> I think this cream is wonderful. It didn&#x27;t prevent me from burning during the radiation treatment but was very soothing. Helped with the dry itchy skin.</li>
            <li> My radiologist switched me to this cream half way through my 30 treatments in the hopes that it would help my skin to avoid burning while I had breast radiation.  The cream absorbs quickly and does not have a strong scent.  I applied it 3-4 times a day.  In the end, I did burn, BUT I think my burn was not as bad as it could have been.  The burn was not very painful and did not peel.  I am giving this 4 stars instead of 5 because it did not prevent burning altogether.</li>
            <li> At 5 weeks into radiation my mothers skin was red and like leather. She has now been using My Girls skin care cream since she received it 4 days ago. He skin is lightening and back to a normal texture. We are so grateful for this cream and the amazing job it has done!</li>
            <li> This was a life saver. I did get a sample from the radiation oncologist, along with a few other type creams, unfortunately I went with the free stuff and didn&#x27;t purchase this right away. ALSO, PLEASE note this---you need to start using cream on your FIRST day of radiation and keep it up all the way thru. This was either not mentioned at my introductory visit or if so it was not STRESSED. And as scared as I was on my first day it would have had to be taped to my forehead. If reading this review saves even one woman from enduring what I went thru then I&#x27;m glad I took the time to write a review.  I didn&#x27;t get this great stuff until my 3rd out of 4 weeks of treatments.  By then I already had raw patches, folliculitus and severely painful allover. And to stuff that all inside a bra for work every day!  They even gave me silver sulfadiazide cream and it didn&#x27;t do as much as this stuff did in the first few days of use.  Now, finally, a full 15 days after my final treatment I have no raw flesh, skin is much less red, just a tiny bit itchy from peeling skin on my chest, but even the nipple is looking better and I never thought that poor thing would survive much less speak to me ever.  First day since my needle biopsy in february that I am starting to feel human again....I realize passage of time has a lot to do with that, but this cream was the difference between healing and wishing they had just cut the darned thing off.....</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do much of anything. Skin tightened up and dried out. I did like how smooth and whipped it is. Went on very easy. Had to switch to different product though. Really did not help with my burn.</li>
            <li> I just finished radiation treatment for breast cancer and this, along with another cream, helped immensely</li>
            <li> Hi! I was diagnosed with invasive Stage 3 breast cancer 4 years ago and discovered this cream while undergoing radiation. I immediately bought a jar and applied it after each treatment. During the 7 weeks of radiation, my skin was soothed by this wonderful cream. My doctors were amazed at how well it protected my skin. I still use it today as an all over moisturizer!</li>
            <li> I have ongoing sensitivity, itchiness and pain from radiation in the area where my bra strap rubs against my skin.  Nothing was working until I tried My Girls and the irritation and sensitivity has reduced dramatically after less than a week.  Fabulous, nongreasy (non-staining) product.  A miracle.</li>
            <li> My daughter first gave me this when I had to undergo radiation. I now bought it for my mom&#x27;s radiation treatment.Because of the location of the radiation I used it in conjunction with the Navajo cream. My girls fo day and Navajo for night . I highly recommend this product</li>
