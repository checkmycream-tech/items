            <li>I really LOVE all of these products !</li>
            <li>I have always received compliments on the amazing grace body lotion</li>
            <li>I bought this because I liked the fragrance.  </li>
            <li>From all the reviews I was expecting something wonderful in the way of fragrance but to my nose this is very run of the mill.</li>
            <li>Even people who are allergic to perfumes comment on how nice I smell.  </li>
            <li>I ordered the lotion thinking it would be just as nice</li>
            <li>lotion is clean and a great way to layer the scent</li>
            <li>She liked this one even better.</li>
            <li>Wonderfully soft and brilliant!</li>
            <li>Have used many products from Philosophy and if you want a nice clean scent that isn&#x27;t overpowering, this is the solution!</li>
            <li>Grace is a wonderful light lotion with a fresh, clean scent.  </li>
            <li>Has a nice scent not to strong.</li>
            <li>Pure Grace is a great layering fragrance.</li>
            <li>I love this scent although I must say it doesn&#x27;t seem as potent as it used to be.</li>
            <li>However, unlike most perfumed lotions this one&#x27;s fragrance disappears almost as soon as you put it on.  </li>
            <li>Great feel to the lotion (non-greasy) yet very moisturizing.  </li>
            <li>Scent ok</li>
            <li>Plus, I love reading the bottle :-)</li>
            <li>Love the smell of it and love the smell on my body.  </li>
            <li>I just wish the smell will linger more on my body.  </li>
            <li>I still recommend because I love it.</li>
            <li>Great body lotion, and gentle fragrance</li>
            <li>My wife is in love with this product.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s now my all-time favorite body lotion.  </li>
            <li>This product helps with the dryness and also makes me feel better about myself.</li>
            <li>Used this for many years.</li>
            <li>Quite possibly my most favorite scent of all time.</li>
            <li>I work in a home improvement store and get many complements . . .</li>
            <li>I love Philosophy products.  </li>
            <li>but I will not be ordering any more of these products from this seller.</li>
            <li>I love this scent.</li>
            <li>I love the product, however the packaging needs improving.</li>
            <li>Always my favorite lotion brand - never use anything else.  </li>
            <li>Priced better than retail stores.</li>
            <li>Love the fragrance of this lotion..</li>
            <li>Love the scent..</li>
            <li>Has a very clean smell.</li>
            <li>good deal for first time customer of philosophy</li>
            <li>Pure Grace body lotion from Philosophy is a great smelling light weight body lotion.</li>
            <li>It is a great moisturizer with a light, clean, fresh scent that lasts all day.  </li>
            <li>It is not that I dis-like PURE Grace; I just really really really love the AMAZING Grace</li>
            <li>I can give you a million reasons I love Philosophy but the bottom line is the products all smell clean.</li>
            <li>The scent goes well with my wife, easy to use, not greasy.  </li>
            <li>I have been using it for more than 5 years on a daily basis -- but EVERY time I wear it, somebody tells me I smell great.  </li>
            <li>And I love the clean scent.  </li>
            <li>It is clean and refreshing.</li>
            <li>they are to strong for me since I have allergies.  </li>
            <li>Love, love, love this Pure Grace Body Lotion.</li>
            <li>And apparently, that&#x27;s a great way to smell, considering the compliments I still</li>
            <li>It is very moisturizing, yet light!!</li>
            <li>I received the pure grace body wash for Christmas and it smelled so nice.</li>
            <li>Yes - it also smells fabulous</li>
            <li>We originally got the 16 oz bottle and she liked so much we have up sized to the 32.</li>
            <li>while it smell s very nice, and softens the skin, the smell does not last over 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>I love the fresh clean scent.  </li>
            <li>I really liked this product -- the smell in particular.</li>
            <li>Was excited for my package.</li>
            <li>My boyfriend smelled it and immediately buried his face in my skin to smell more ;)</li>
            <li>I ended up giving this to my daughter to finish up because it wasn&#x27;t the wonderful smell it was advertised to be in my opinion and was no better than a brand from Walmart</li>
            <li>Love this lotion came exactly as promised and in a timely manner.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s definitely worth the price!</li>
            <li>I love these products and this particular scent is very light &amp; fresh.</li>
            <li>Almost a band aid smell - clean but...</li>
            <li>The fragrance is like you just stepped out of the shower, soapy and clean.  </li>
            <li>Goes on smoothly, absorbs quickly, non-greasy.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s also a nice moisturizer, light and soft.</li>
            <li>To me it smells a lot like clean laundry.  </li>
            <li>I am glad I found Pure grace.  </li>
            <li>Scent-wise Pure Grace is just okay.  </li>
            <li>Really nice, soft fragrance, clean smell.  </li>
            <li>I love the scent and the fact that it&#x27;s not greasy, soaks in very well after ashower.</li>
            <li>This is the third time I&#x27;ve bought this brand and it has always been a good experience.</li>
            <li>First of all, it smells fantastic; clean and not overpowering.  </li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need perfume after putting this on, it&#x27;s a clean fresh smell.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a floral or woodsy aroma; you just smell clean and fresh, like soap and water.</li>
            <li>It has that just out of the shower clean fresh smell.</li>
            <li>clean, inviting, sensual fresh</li>
            <li>I love it and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>My legs below the knee, my arms and hands,  are all dried up and not too beautiful, but this lotion seems not only to make my skin look better,  it makes my skin feel better, and lasts a couple of days.&lt;br /&gt;Dry</li>
            <li>This is a nice hand and body lotion and really makes my skin feel soft, moist and smooth.  </li>
            <li>At first I thought this was a lot of money to spend on lotion, but it is worth every penny!</li>
            <li>It truly does smell exactly as stated, clean and fresh!&lt;br /&gt;Once</li>
            <li>Smells sooo clean, fresh, and crisp, with the scent lingering on your skin for hours afterward.</li>
            <li>I like the soft scent of Pure Grace and it is a nice part of the Philosophy line of products.</li>
            <li>Smells amazing and it it dont ball up when doing back rubs.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s really worth it</li>
            <li>He had smelled it on a stranger and liked it enough to ask her what it was so he could get it for his wife.</li>
            <li>They say it has a fresh smell.</li>
            <li>but they both say it is worth it.</li>
            <li>I love this fragrance and it keeps my skin feeling so soft.</li>
            <li>Its a clean fresh sent and very soothing on my hands and arms.</li>
            <li>It helps my dry itchy winter skin feel hydrated and it has a light refreshing scent</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t moisturize very much.</li>
            <li>and it is very gentle on myskin.</li>
            <li>I expected it to smell similarly to amazing grace.</li>
            <li>Thanks, Amazon!</li>
            <li>I absolutely love the scent of this lotion and have purchased several times.</li>
            <li>As a woman who needs a moisturizing lotion and wants one that smells fresh in an unobtrusive way, this is the the body lotion for me.</li>
            <li>This is the first time she has purchased the item on line.  </li>
            <li>I traditionally give the Amazing Grace Bath and Body products to new Moms.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Normally I wouldn&#x27;t write a review for something I consider a female product, but besides the scent, which thankfully isn&#x27;t some flowery room deodorizer type aroma, but in fact rather clean and light, the stuff really seems to,work.  </li>
            <li>Smells clean and is a nice addition to everyday smelling like I just got out of the shower!  </li>
            <li>Pure Grace is such a fresh, clean scent.  </li>
            <li>Large size bottle with pump lasts forever.</li>
            <li>so I thought I&#x27;d try the pure grace as well.</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t be buying the Pure Grace scented lotion again.  </li>
            <li>Pure Grace has a heavenly pure scent.</li>
            <li>It is good for dry, aging skin and the moisturizing effects last all day.</li>
            <li>my skin really appreciated it.</li>
            <li>It also moisturizers very well.</li>
            <li>However, I don&#x27;t really care for the smell.</li>
            <li>She absolutely loves this lotion.  </li>
            <li>perfume smells good.&amp;#34;  Also, the lotion works very well.  </li>
            <li>It really , truly does smell like you just took a shower and the soap scent is lingering.</li>
            <li>I top it off with Pure Grace perfume, or any other Grace fragrance to compliment it.  </li>
            <li>But there are MANY other lotions that will do that.  </li>
            <li>and I receive more compliments on this than any other fragrance I have worn.</li>
            <li>It is such a clean scent that it never offends people.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend their whole line</li>
            <li>It is quite a nice fragrance, not strong and flowery but softly spoken, very graceful and lingering.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend this scent for anyone who struggles with allergies to floral scents.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend</li>
            <li>I recommend it highly.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend using it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>soft, soft skin, a real must after a shower and before nighttime.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this to every woman and young girls.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not very subtle.</li>
            <li>Get compliments frequently!  </li>
            <li>I really wish I hadn&#x27;t spent so much money on it.</li>
            <li>makes my skin feel soft.</li>
            <li>I will try going directly from the department store.</li>
            <li>The texture of the lotion is soft and silky.</li>
            <li>This scent is soft and lovely...recommend it.</li>
            <li>My extremity can get very chaffed and dry, even flaking a bit.</li>
            <li>My elbows and knees were so dry, but this lotion moisturizes very well.  </li>
            <li>it barely has a scent.</li>
            <li>GF loves it, I  put it on the back of my gnarly old hands, seems to help, but she&#x27;s the expert and says it&#x27;s great!&lt;br</li>
            <li>Keeps my skin soft all day long!!</li>

            <li> This product helps with the dryness and also makes me feel better about myself.</li>
            <li> Used this for many years.</li>
            <li> Quite possibly my most favorite scent of all time.</li>
            <li> I work in a home improvement store and get many complements . . .</li>
            <li> I love Philosophy products.  </li>

            <li> I love this scent.</li>
            <li> I love the product, however the packaging needs improving.</li>
            <li> Always my favorite lotion brand - never use anything else.  </li>
            <li> Priced better than retail stores.</li>

            <li> good deal for first time customer of philosophy</li>
            <li> Pure Grace body lotion from Philosophy is a great smelling light weight body lotion.</li>
            <li> It is a great moisturizer with a light, clean, fresh scent that lasts all day.  </li>
            <li> It is not that I dis-like PURE Grace; I just really really really love the AMAZING Grace</li>
            <li> I can give you a million reasons I love Philosophy but the bottom line is the products all smell clean.</li>
            <li> The scent goes well with my wife, easy to use, not greasy.  </li>
            <li> I have been using it for more than 5 years on a daily basis -- but EVERY time I wear it, somebody tells me I smell great.  </li>
            <li> And I love the clean scent.  </li>
            <li> It is clean and refreshing.</li>
            <li> they are to strong for me since I have allergies.  </li>
            <li> Love, love, love this Pure Grace Body Lotion.</li>
            <li> And apparently, that&#x27;s a great way to smell, considering the compliments I still</li>
            <li> It is very moisturizing, yet light!!</li>
            <li> I received the pure grace body wash for Christmas and it smelled so nice.</li>
            <li> Yes - it also smells fabulous</li>
            <li> We originally got the 16 oz bottle and she liked so much we have up sized to the 32.</li>
            <li> while it smell s very nice, and softens the skin, the smell does not last over 30 minutes.</li>
            <li> I love the fresh clean scent.  </li>
            <li> I really liked this product -- the smell in particular.</li>
            <li> Was excited for my package.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend smelled it and immediately buried his face in my skin to smell more ;)</li>
            <li> I ended up giving this to my daughter to finish up because it wasn&#x27;t the wonderful smell it was advertised to be in my opinion and was no better than a brand from Walmart</li>
            <li> Love this lotion came exactly as promised and in a timely manner.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s definitely worth the price!</li>
            <li> I love these products and this particular scent is very light &amp; fresh.</li>
            <li> Almost a band aid smell - clean but...</li>
            <li> The fragrance is like you just stepped out of the shower, soapy and clean.  </li>
            <li> Goes on smoothly, absorbs quickly, non-greasy.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s also a nice moisturizer, light and soft.</li>
            <li> To me it smells a lot like clean laundry.  </li>
            <li> I am glad I found Pure grace.  </li>
            <li> Scent-wise Pure Grace is just okay.  </li>
            <li> Really nice, soft fragrance, clean smell.  </li>
            <li> I love the scent and the fact that it&#x27;s not greasy, soaks in very well after ashower.</li>
            <li> This is the third time I&#x27;ve bought this brand and it has always been a good experience.</li>
            <li> First of all, it smells fantastic; clean and not overpowering.  </li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need perfume after putting this on, it&#x27;s a clean fresh smell.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a floral or woodsy aroma; you just smell clean and fresh, like soap and water.</li>
            <li> It has that just out of the shower clean fresh smell.</li>
            <li> clean, inviting, sensual fresh</li>
            <li> I love it and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> My legs below the knee, my arms and hands,  are all dried up and not too beautiful, but this lotion seems not only to make my skin look better,  it makes my skin feel better, and lasts a couple of days.&lt;br /&gt;Dry</li>
            <li> This is a nice hand and body lotion and really makes my skin feel soft, moist and smooth.  </li>
            <li> At first I thought this was a lot of money to spend on lotion, but it is worth every penny!</li>
            <li> It truly does smell exactly as stated, clean and fresh!&lt;br /&gt;Once</li>
            <li> Smells sooo clean, fresh, and crisp, with the scent lingering on your skin for hours afterward.</li>
            <li> I like the soft scent of Pure Grace and it is a nice part of the Philosophy line of products.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing and it it dont ball up when doing back rubs.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s really worth it</li>
            <li> He had smelled it on a stranger and liked it enough to ask her what it was so he could get it for his wife.</li>
            <li> They say it has a fresh smell.</li>
            <li> but they both say it is worth it.</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance and it keeps my skin feeling so soft.</li>
            <li> Its a clean fresh sent and very soothing on my hands and arms.</li>
            <li> It helps my dry itchy winter skin feel hydrated and it has a light refreshing scent</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t moisturize very much.</li>
            <li> and it is very gentle on myskin.</li>
            <li> I expected it to smell similarly to amazing grace.</li>
            <li> Thanks, Amazon!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the scent of this lotion and have purchased several times.</li>
            <li> As a woman who needs a moisturizing lotion and wants one that smells fresh in an unobtrusive way, this is the the body lotion for me.</li>
            <li> This is the first time she has purchased the item on line.  </li>
            <li> I traditionally give the Amazing Grace Bath and Body products to new Moms.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Normally I wouldn&#x27;t write a review for something I consider a female product, but besides the scent, which thankfully isn&#x27;t some flowery room deodorizer type aroma, but in fact rather clean and light, the stuff really seems to,work.  </li>
            <li> Smells clean and is a nice addition to everyday smelling like I just got out of the shower!  </li>
            <li> Pure Grace is such a fresh, clean scent.  </li>
            <li> Large size bottle with pump lasts forever.</li>
            <li> so I thought I&#x27;d try the pure grace as well.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t be buying the Pure Grace scented lotion again.  </li>
            <li> Pure Grace has a heavenly pure scent.</li>
            <li> It is good for dry, aging skin and the moisturizing effects last all day.</li>
            <li> my skin really appreciated it.</li>
            <li> It also moisturizers very well.</li>
            <li> However, I don&#x27;t really care for the smell.</li>
            <li> She absolutely loves this lotion.  </li>
            <li> perfume smells good.&amp;#34;  Also, the lotion works very well.  </li>
            <li> It really , truly does smell like you just took a shower and the soap scent is lingering.</li>
            <li> I top it off with Pure Grace perfume, or any other Grace fragrance to compliment it.  </li>
            <li> But there are MANY other lotions that will do that.  </li>
            <li> and I receive more compliments on this than any other fragrance I have worn.</li>
            <li> It is such a clean scent that it never offends people.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend their whole line</li>
            <li> It is quite a nice fragrance, not strong and flowery but softly spoken, very graceful and lingering.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend this scent for anyone who struggles with allergies to floral scents.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend</li>
            <li> I recommend it highly.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend using it.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> soft, soft skin, a real must after a shower and before nighttime.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this to every woman and young girls.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not very subtle.</li>
            <li> Get compliments frequently!  </li>
            <li> I really wish I hadn&#x27;t spent so much money on it.</li>
            <li> makes my skin feel soft.</li>
            <li> I will try going directly from the department store.</li>
            <li> The texture of the lotion is soft and silky.</li>
            <li> This scent is soft and lovely...recommend it.</li>
            <li> My extremity can get very chaffed and dry, even flaking a bit.</li>
            <li> My elbows and knees were so dry, but this lotion moisturizes very well.  </li>
            <li> it barely has a scent.</li>
            <li> GF loves it, I  put it on the back of my gnarly old hands, seems to help, but she&#x27;s the expert and says it&#x27;s great!&lt;br</li>
            <li> Keeps my skin soft all day long!!</li>
            <li> The scent of this product was extremey subtle and it was just right.</li>
            <li> it reminds me of toilet bowl cleaner.</li>
            <li> Wife has been a long time user.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not overpowering and it does not stick around for that long.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve suffered from dry, itchy skin all my life, until I lucked into these lotions, that is.  </li>
            <li> Bought this as a Christmas present for a friend and actually ended up not being the one she usually used.  </li>
            <li> I have an extra extremity that I don&#x27;t like to talk about and keep wrapped and hidden under my clothing.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected.</li>
            <li> It can be worn even when wearing other perfume fragrances...</li>
            <li> It does not allow me to get the lotion out, which is not very convenient!</li>
            <li> That is my only complaint.</li>
            <li> Not worth the price.</li>
            <li> No more dry peeling.  </li>
            <li> Overpriced, odd smell, and doesnt work as well as cheaper brands.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin so soft, even in this cold, dry weather.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not overwhelming at all.</li>
            <li> To me it doesn&#x27;t smell expensive or any different from something off the grocery store shelf.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not able to return.</li>
            <li> VERY expensive for a lotion with no fragrance and a huge disappointment.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not really loving the scent.</li>
            <li> That seemed a little scary</li>
            <li> I am disappointed that the pump does not work properly.  </li>
            <li> It came with the pump broken.</li>
            <li> Then found a bottle with a broken pump inside.</li>
            <li> The dispenser pump was broken.</li>
            <li> This size bottle is a little annoying because the pump is very slow to re-prime.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry</li>
            <li> Mad me sad!</li>
            <li> This was a bad purchase.</li>
            <li> I hate perfume</li>
            <li> This lotion smells awful</li>
            <li> and it smells terrible.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> Pure Grace body lotion from Philosophy is a great smelling light weight body lotion. Large size bottle with pump lasts forever.</li>
            <li> I really liked this product -- the smell in particular. It&#x27;s texture was great and my skin really appreciated it.</li>
            <li> I love this scent although I must say it doesn&#x27;t seem as potent as it used to be.</li>
            <li> I love these products and this particular scent is very light &amp; fresh. It also moisturizers very well. I love it and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS AND THE BATH  LOTION!</li>
            <li> Overpriced, odd smell, and doesnt work as well as cheaper brands.</li>
            <li> This product is so wonderful. I love the scent and the fact that it&#x27;s not greasy, soaks in very well after ashower. The product came right on time which made me very happy. I would recommend this product to anyone!</li>
            <li> This is a nice hand and body lotion and really makes my skin feel soft, moist and smooth.  But there are MANY other lotions that will do that.  I bought this because I liked the fragrance.  However, unlike most perfumed lotions this one&#x27;s fragrance disappears almost as soon as you put it on.  VERY expensive for a lotion with no fragrance and a huge disappointment.  Thank heaven there was no shipping charges for this.  Thanks, Amazon!</li>
            <li> A bit pricey but it&#x27;s really worth it</li>
            <li> We originally got the 16 oz bottle and she liked so much we have up sized to the 32. So I guess to describe it&#x27;s attributes would be to say it does what a lotion is supposed to do.</li>
            <li> Have to apply a lot and often for fragrance to last.</li>
            <li> I can give you a million reasons I love Philosophy but the bottom line is the products all smell clean.</li>
            <li> It came with the pump broken. That is my only complaint.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t go out without it!  The texture is creamy and moisturizing, but not greasy.  It can be worn even when wearing other perfume fragrances...Pure Grace is a great layering fragrance.</li>
            <li> makes my skin feel soft.</li>
            <li> I love the body lotion! It is just like the description stated, arrived quick, very happy with the product. This is the third time I&#x27;ve bought this brand and it has always been a good experience.</li>
            <li> Bought this as a Christmas present for a friend and actually ended up not being the one she usually used.  She liked this one even better.</li>
            <li> Was excited for my package. Then found a bottle with a broken pump inside. Mad me sad!</li>
            <li> Great feel to the lotion (non-greasy) yet very moisturizing.  Scent ok but Amazing one is superior.  Almost a band aid smell - clean but...</li>
            <li> it barely has a scent. it doesn&#x27;t moisturize very much. Not worth the price. I will never order any Philosophy products again.</li>
            <li> At first I thought this was a lot of money to spend on lotion, but it is worth every penny! It truly does smell exactly as stated, clean and fresh!&lt;br /&gt;Once you try it, nothing else will do!!&lt;br /&gt;  Plus, I love reading the bottle :-)</li>
            <li> Love the smell of it and love the smell on my body.  I hate perfume they are to strong for me since I have allergies.  I am glad I found Pure grace.  I just wish the smell will linger more on my body.  I still recommend because I love it.</li>
            <li> I love this, love this product!!! I use it every day.. The fragrance is like you just stepped out of the shower, soapy and clean.  Highly recommend this to every woman and young girls.</li>
            <li> Like all philosophy products, this one delivers. Smells sooo clean, fresh, and crisp, with the scent lingering on your skin for hours afterward. I can&#x27;t stop smelling my skin! It&#x27;s not overwhelming at all. My boyfriend smelled it and immediately buried his face in my skin to smell more ;)</li>
            <li> Have used many products from Philosophy and if you want a nice clean scent that isn&#x27;t overpowering, this is the solution! One issue is the pump cap which often is damaged in shipping...has happened to me twice.</li>
            <li> I like the soft scent of Pure Grace and it is a nice part of the Philosophy line of products. It is good for dry, aging skin and the moisturizing effects last all day.</li>
            <li> I ended up giving this to my daughter to finish up because it wasn&#x27;t the wonderful smell it was advertised to be in my opinion and was no better than a brand from Walmart</li>
            <li> This is a great all around body lotion product.  Perfectly unisex,  Not greasy.  Can be used morning or night.  Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I feel like Im on vacation when I smell this lotion . I have ordered the spray too . Would recommend.</li>
            <li> The scent of this product was extremey subtle and it was just right. It was not at all creamy and it is very gentle on myskin.</li>
            <li> This lotion smells awful it reminds me of toilet bowl cleaner.</li>
            <li> Great body lotion, and gentle fragrance</li>
            <li> My wife is in love with this product. she loves how it feels on her and how it smells.</li>
            <li> The scent is wonderful, not too strong and not too floral; almost could be for man or woman.  Goes on smoothly, absorbs quickly, non-greasy.  I think it&#x27;s now my all-time favorite body lotion.  I even use it on my face sometimes!</li>
            <li> Really nice, soft fragrance, clean smell.  I would buy this again.</li>
            <li> Love this lotion!  It absorbs so quickly and feels great!</li>
            <li> It is quite a nice fragrance, not strong and flowery but softly spoken, very graceful and lingering.  I like it a lot.</li>
            <li> Love this lotion came exactly as promised and in a timely manner.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the scent of this lotion and have purchased several times. You don&#x27;t need perfume after putting this on, it&#x27;s a clean fresh smell. LOVE it!!</li>
            <li> The scent goes well with my wife, easy to use, not greasy.  She loves using it.</li>
            <li> My wife likes it and gets it when needed</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!!  I have been using it for more than 5 years on a daily basis -- but EVERY time I wear it, somebody tells me I smell great.  It&#x27;s not a floral or woodsy aroma; you just smell clean and fresh, like soap and water. And apparently, that&#x27;s a great way to smell, considering the compliments I still get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s also a nice moisturizer, light and soft. It is not a heavy-duty cream, so look elsewhere if that&#x27;s what you want.  As a woman who needs a moisturizing lotion and wants one that smells fresh in an unobtrusive way, this is the the body lotion for me.</li>
            <li> I expected it to smell similarly to amazing grace. I&#x27;m not really loving the scent.</li>
            <li> Wonderful for your skin and smells delightful!</li>
            <li> This lotion feels good on my skin and moisturizes well. However, I don&#x27;t really care for the smell. It reminds me of Ivory soap.</li>
            <li> Grace is a wonderful light lotion with a fresh, clean scent.  I&#x27;m often complimented,  I wear it as my daily perfume as well as skin softening.</li>
            <li> I have an extra extremity that I don&#x27;t like to talk about and keep wrapped and hidden under my clothing. My extremity can get very chaffed and dry, even flaking a bit. This product helps with the dryness and also makes me feel better about myself.</li>
            <li> From all the reviews I was expecting something wonderful in the way of fragrance but to my nose this is very run of the mill. To me it doesn&#x27;t smell expensive or any different from something off the grocery store shelf. It&#x27;s not very subtle. I really wish I hadn&#x27;t spent so much money on it. I&#x27;ll probably give it to my daughter.</li>
            <li> good deal for first time customer of philosophy</li>
            <li> I buy this for my daughter. She loves it.</li>
            <li> Used this for many years.</li>
            <li> I love the fresh clean scent.  It moisturizes and does not feel greasy.</li>
            <li> This lotion is great.  Has a nice scent not to strong.</li>
            <li> Quite possibly my most favorite scent of all time. It has that just out of the shower clean fresh smell. Very reminiscent of line-dried laundry....It does not over power anything and I receive more compliments on this than any other fragrance I have worn. Pair this lotion with the perfume. It layers beautifully.</li>
            <li> I bought this lotion for my daughter for Christmas.  This is her very favorite scent.  She absolutely loves this lotion.  It is a great moisturizer with a light, clean, fresh scent that lasts all day.  She has used it every day since getting it.  Would highly recommend this scent for anyone who struggles with allergies to floral scents.  I can tolerate this one without any reactions.</li>
            <li> This is the best lotion ever! It makes my skin so soft, even in this cold, dry weather. It has a light and wonderful aroma. It is my favorite body lotion!</li>
            <li> I like this lotion. It helps my dry itchy winter skin feel hydrated and it has a light refreshing scent</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this Pure Grace Body Lotion. It has the freshest, lightest scent that actually lasts and the lotion is not at all sticky. It is very moisturizing, yet light!! Highly recommend and it&#x27;s definitely worth the price!</li>
            <li> I have always received compliments on the amazing grace body lotion so I thought I&#x27;d try the pure grace as well. Yes - it also smells fabulous and I get compliments on the scent as well. I hat to wear cologne or perfume so these body lotions fit the bill perfectly. I be smellin&#x27; good!!!</li>
            <li> This stuff smells wonderful. Has a very clean smell.</li>
            <li> I work in a home improvement store and get many complements . . . from men and women. Its a clean fresh sent and very soothing on my hands and arms. I feel undressed without it.</li>
            <li> Wife has been a long time user.  This is the first time she has purchased the item on line.  Will continue to use the product until it no longer produces the desired results.</li>
            <li> My brother-in-law asked me to get this for his wife as a surpise gift. He had smelled it on a stranger and liked it enough to ask her what it was so he could get it for his wife. That seemed a little scary but.... she loved it when she got it. They say it has a fresh smell. Guess I&#x27;ll have to give it a try. It was about $30 for the 16oz. size but they both say it is worth it.</li>
            <li> I am 78 years old,a fact that startles people.  One reason is that my skin doesn&#x27;t look like parchment.  It stays dewy looking with one application of Miracle Worker, or even When Hope is Not Enough,  But, the best, for me are the shower and body lotions.  I&#x27;ve suffered from dry, itchy skin all my life, until I lucked into these lotions, that is.  And I love the clean scent.  Even people who are allergic to perfumes comment on how nice I smell.  Compared to Department Store cremes, Philosophy is a bargain.  I highly recommend their whole line</li>
            <li> I love Philosophy products.  I am disappointed that the pump does not work properly.  It does not allow me to get the lotion out, which is not very convenient!</li>
            <li> Love this lotion!  Smells clean and is a nice addition to everyday smelling like I just got out of the shower!  It lasts too!</li>
            <li> while it smell s very nice, and softens the skin, the smell does not last over 30 minutes. I keep hearing that it has been changed, the same goes for the spray fragrance, I paid over $80. dollars for these two products and I don&#x27;t feel I got what I paid for. I&#x27;m sorry but I will not be ordering any more of these products from this seller. I will try going directly from the department store.</li>
            <li> I traditionally give the Amazing Grace Bath and Body products to new Moms.  The message is really lovely and the product is great....wonderful fragrance and softens skin nicely. Love it!</li>
            <li> This stuff is the best.  First of all, it smells fantastic; clean and not overpowering.  People tell me I smell good.  They don&#x27;t say &amp;#34;your perfume smells good.&amp;#34;  Also, the lotion works very well.  My elbows and knees were so dry, but this lotion moisturizes very well.  I feel great wearing it.  I top it off with Pure Grace perfume, or any other Grace fragrance to compliment it.  I recommend it highly.</li>
            <li> Now this is my signature fragrance! have worn it for years and always get compliments. It is such a clean scent that it never offends people. It really , truly does smell like you just took a shower and the soap scent is lingering. Love it!!</li>
            <li> I love this scent. clean, inviting, sensual fresh I def would recommend. lotion is clean and a great way to layer the scent</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance and it keeps my skin feeling so soft. Would highly recommend using it. Have had good luck with all the Philosophy products.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing and it it dont ball up when doing back rubs. I really LOVE all of these products !</li>
            <li> Philosphy&#x27;s lotion is a great product: good coverage, thickness, etc.  This size bottle is a little annoying because the pump is very slow to re-prime.  When you are trying to get several pumps out to cover your legs, it takes longer than it should.  Scent-wise Pure Grace is just okay.  To me it smells a lot like clean laundry.  It&#x27;s not overpowering and it does not stick around for that long. I won&#x27;t be buying the Pure Grace scented lotion again.  It is not that I dis-like PURE Grace; I just really really really love the AMAZING Grace scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for taking the time to read my review, and I hope you found it helpful in making a purchase decision.</li>
            <li> Very good just what I was  looking for.</li>
            <li> bought for a friend&#x27;s birthday, she loved it!</li>
            <li> GF loves it, I  put it on the back of my gnarly old hands, seems to help, but she&#x27;s the expert and says it&#x27;s great!&lt;br /&gt;Normally I wouldn&#x27;t write a review for something I consider a female product, but besides the scent, which thankfully isn&#x27;t some flowery room deodorizer type aroma, but in fact rather clean and light, the stuff really seems to,work.  My legs below the knee, my arms and hands,  are all dried up and not too beautiful, but this lotion seems not only to make my skin look better,  it makes my skin feel better, and lasts a couple of days.&lt;br /&gt;Dry skin is what it is, male or female, definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> Pure Grace has a heavenly pure scent. It is clean and refreshing. The texture of the lotion is soft and silky.</li>
            <li> This was a bad purchase. I received the pure grace body wash for Christmas and it smelled so nice. I ordered the lotion thinking it would be just as nice and it smells terrible.  I was told it smells like suntan lotion. I will not be using this lotion. I didn&#x27;t keep the box or receipt so I&#x27;m not able to return. Lesson learned.</li>
            <li> I love the product, however the packaging needs improving. The dispenser pump was broken.</li>
            <li> Always my favorite lotion brand - never use anything else.  Priced better than retail stores.</li>
            <li> This was a gift and I understand that the person who received it just loves it. A definite two thumbs up!</li>
            <li> Wonderfully soft and brilliant! Keeps my skin soft all day long!!</li>
            <li> This scent is soft and lovely...recommend it.</li>
            <li> Pricey but I did like the fragrance.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected. Has a very nice smell.</li>
            <li> Pure Grace is such a fresh, clean scent.  It&#x27;s my go-to lotion that is feminine, but not overly so.  It&#x27;s also not overpowering so it won&#x27;t clash with the scents of hair spray, cologne, etc.</li>
            <li> Love the fragrance of this lotion.. Get compliments frequently!  Keeps my skin feeling&lt;br /&gt;Hydrated.</li>
            <li> Best lotion ever! moisturizer and purest smelling lotion you can find!</li>
            <li> Love the scent..great, prompt service</li>
            <li> I was looking for a good gift for my wife who loves these products.  They are excellent and a really good gift idea!</li>
            <li> wonderful light scent....soft, soft skin, a real must after a shower and before nighttime.</li>
            <li> This is the best body lotion I have ever used.  Moisturizer that lasts.  No more dry peeling.  Highly recommend this product.</li>
