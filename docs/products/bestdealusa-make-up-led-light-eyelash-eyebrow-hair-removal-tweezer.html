            <li>Truthfully, the little flashlight that comes with it is great!  </li>
            <li>Additionally, it can easily get stuck with the flashlight turned on, just by being bumped.  </li>
            <li>The switch is easy to use.</li>
            <li>I own the same kind of product from Revlon and it works a lot better.</li>
            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t grab fine hair well</li>
            <li>I use it for fine assembly</li>
            <li>The light portion of this tweezer work fine.  </li>
            <li>It plucks very well and the light is a nice bonus.</li>
            <li>Tweezers didn&#x27;t align and then the light stopped working too, even with battery replacement.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how they sell these for so cheap on Amazon.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s no rotation on the light --</li>
            <li>The price is great and you even get an extra battery.  </li>
            <li>light works</li>
            <li>Light works</li>
            <li>Like the light it has.</li>
            <li>The light does make it helpful.</li>
            <li>The Revlon tweezers are fantastic, with or without the flashlight.  </li>
            <li>The only good thing is I didn&#x27;t lose too much money because thry were cheap!!</li>
            <li>This is such an amazing item!  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really feel like it helps to see where I am tweezing any better than one without a light.</li>
            <li>I was super excited to get these.</li>
            <li>May not be fancy, like my previous lighted tweezer, even so the light is great and the tweezers do work.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s LED and just the right amount of light.  </li>
            <li>The LED light went out the first time I used.</li>
            <li>The light is great, which is usually what&#x27;s lacking in these types of tweezers.</li>
            <li>For the price, these little things are great.</li>
            <li>Definitely recommend this handy tool.</li>
            <li>Worth the price, I got it for like ~$2.40.</li>
            <li>worth every penny..</li>
            <li>Would be excellent to use on someone else but using on myself felt awkward to get the light in the correct position.</li>
            <li>Anyway when it came I was surprised how useful it was to have the light.</li>
            <li>It really helps you see the hair more clearly.</li>
            <li>the only gripe that I have is that the tweezers are just ok they work</li>
            <li>It looks exactly like the picture.</li>
            <li>Item was exactly as described and pictured.</li>
            <li>Get this for new moms and dads, or anyone who ever uses tweezers!!</li>
            <li>The tweezers really don&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>It really helps.</li>
            <li>SO MUCH</li>
            <li>I figured I didn&#x27;t have much to lose, so I ordered one of these.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I took the recommendation from many other reviewers....</li>
            <li>Nice lighted tweezers to see hard to get brow hairs.</li>
            <li>the area which gets the light is very limited.</li>
            <li>At first i didnt know if i would purchase this product but after doing a little research and even though i didnt really found much.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little like a spot light</li>
            <li>In my desperation, I clearly did not note the amount of time that this tweezer would take to get to my doorstep.</li>
            <li>only twice so now it will not even tweeze very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s set to aim directly.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s positioned and lights in a direct line just as shown in the picture.  </li>

            <li> construction of this tweezer is poor - it doesn&#x27;t fit tightly to the flashlight piece.  </li>
            <li> They won&#x27;t grab on to the hair tight enough.  </li>
            <li> like all tweezers they do not squeeze tight enough but they do the job.</li>
            <li> I desperately wanted one with a light on it for item retrieval.  </li>
            <li> Total waste of money.</li>
            <li> came on time as expected</li>
            <li> not strong enough to pluck hairs.  </li>
            <li> Also the edge of the tweezers are so sharp that it cuts the hair rather than pulling it out.</li>
            <li> Nothing like my other pair.</li>
            <li> It also somehow got slightly bent after I used it</li>
            <li> I had one previously and had trouble finding another one.</li>
            <li> I would of replaced the battery but the grip on the tweezers is sharp and not very good.</li>
            <li> Tweezing hairs is a pain in the ass to begin with, but going after the same ones over and over makes it much worse.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time with this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> By that point, I had purchased other tweezers and my son had largely stopped his annoying habits.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why they call these &amp;#34;tweezers&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> I bought this tweezer when my son was going through a phase of shoving small items up his nose (kids do this?</li>
            <li> I am a guy with thick, messy eyebrows</li>
            <li> but it is so hard to bend the prongs</li>
            <li> Although, I do not use the light when plucking my eyebrows as it will blind the crap out of you.</li>
            <li> However, the tweezer part is so stiff it makes it rather difficult to use.  </li>
            <li> but the tweezers part is poorly made and dont line up evenly when you squeeze them together</li>
            <li> poor grip or no grip at all.</li>
            <li> I was unable to grasp even ONE hair to tweeze.  </li>
            <li> Was a bit skeptical when I saw this product</li>
            <li> Difficult to get hold of hair.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The tweezers are laughable.  </li>
            <li> Sadly, the tweezers themselves couldn&#x27;t tweeze a course hair from an animal.</li>
            <li> They are horrible.  </li>
    </ol>

    <ol>
            <li> The lighted tweezers allow me to see the hair I need to remove.  It is invaluable.  Use use it often.  I wold recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> Tweezers didn&#x27;t align and then the light stopped working too, even with battery replacement.  Total waste of money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why they call these &amp;#34;tweezers&amp;#34;.  I was unable to grasp even ONE hair to tweeze.  I took the recommendation from many other reviewers.... I disassembled them and just kept the flashlight part.</li>
            <li> It is a piece of junk. The tweezers really don&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> Nice lighted tweezers to see hard to get brow hairs. Am happy with the ability to tweeze any out of place hair.</li>
            <li> This tweezers works beautifully and having the light on it makes it easier to see the area being tweezers.I did not receive the extra batteries though.</li>
            <li> Would be excellent to use on someone else but using on myself felt awkward to get the light in the correct position. Comes with two sets of batteries which was great! Tweezers also worked well.</li>
            <li> The light is great but it is so hard to bend the prongs and it doesn&#x27;t grab fine hair well</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how they sell these for so cheap on Amazon. The light is extremely bright it comes with extra batteries the only gripe that I have is that the tweezers are just ok they work but nothing great. Makes for a great gift to somebody that likes gadgets.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really feel like it helps to see where I am tweezing any better than one without a light. It also somehow got slightly bent after I used it only twice so now it will not even tweeze very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just get a better quality one from CVS.</li>
            <li> Very nice! Although, I do not use the light when plucking my eyebrows as it will blind the crap out of you. I like to use it in the middle of the night to find my way around so I don&#x27;t have to disturb my boyfriend with a lamp. But it&#x27;s a great pair of tweezers too!</li>
            <li> Love it! Works Great! Light is great! Would buy for a gift! Nice and light and Bright to see your eyebrows!</li>
            <li> bright light but the area which gets the light is very limited. Also the edge of the tweezers are so sharp that it cuts the hair rather than pulling it out.</li>
            <li> Cheap! You get what you pay for!! The LED light went out the first time I used. I would of replaced the battery but the grip on the tweezers is sharp and not very good. The only good thing is I didn&#x27;t lose too much money because thry were cheap!!</li>
            <li> It is really awesome combination of light and tweezers, no worries about missing spots, light is very bright and tweezers work just fine, happy with purchase</li>
            <li> The light portion of this tweezer work fine.  However, the tweezer part is so stiff it makes it rather difficult to use.  I would not purchase this again.</li>
            <li> I bought this tweezer when my son was going through a phase of shoving small items up his nose (kids do this? why?).  I desperately wanted one with a light on it for item retrieval.  In my desperation, I clearly did not note the amount of time that this tweezer would take to get to my doorstep. I think it was about 6 weeks.  By that point, I had purchased other tweezers and my son had largely stopped his annoying habits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The construction of this tweezer is poor - it doesn&#x27;t fit tightly to the flashlight piece.  Additionally, it can easily get stuck with the flashlight turned on, just by being bumped.  And then the flashlight runs out of battery, rending it a bulky tweezer with no point.</li>
            <li> Was a bit skeptical when I saw this product but I thought why not. Anyway when it came I was surprised how useful it was to have the light. It really helps. Also it came with extra batteries. All in all a good buy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so convenient to have a light!  It&#x27;s LED and just the right amount of light.  It&#x27;s a little like a spot light and it&#x27;s set to aim directly.  There&#x27;s no rotation on the light -- it&#x27;s positioned and lights in a direct line just as shown in the picture.  The switch is easy to use. Tweezers are good too.  Definitely recommend this handy tool.</li>
            <li> This is one excellant product, somebody is very ingenious! I am very satisfied with this product i LIKE IT SO MUCH i BOUGHT 3 SETS. Gave my Mom one set and my daughter another set, and kept one for myself. It really helps you see the hair more clearly.</li>
            <li> They are horrible.  Difficult to get hold of hair.  Nothing like my other pair.</li>
            <li> This is the perfect tool for tick removal, especially for dogs with longer fur. This should be marketed for dogs too as the tick population is growing all the time.</li>
            <li> The light is great, the tweezer doesn&#x27;t work very well.</li>
            <li> While the idea is good, the tweezers do not work for me at all.  They won&#x27;t grab on to the hair tight enough.  I own the same kind of product from Revlon and it works a lot better.</li>
            <li> I like this a lot. I had one previously and had trouble finding another one. It works well.</li>
            <li> May not be fancy, like my previous lighted tweezer, even so the light is great and the tweezers do work.  It looks exactly like the picture. The price is great and you even get an extra battery.  I bought two and am glad that I did.</li>
            <li> light works well but the tweezers part is poorly made and dont line up evenly when you squeeze them together</li>
            <li> Tweezing hairs is a pain in the ass to begin with, but going after the same ones over and over makes it much worse. Don&#x27;t waste your time with this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No problem with the seller though. Just the product.</li>
            <li> The tweezers don&#x27;t work we&#x27;ll.  not strong enough to pluck hairs.  Light works ok. Would not recommend buying this product</li>
            <li> The light on these are really great. I was super excited to get these. The tweezers on this are okay, I suppose.</li>
            <li> These are really nice tweezers. I am a guy with thick, messy eyebrows and I bought this to pluck eyebrow hairs. It plucks very well and the light is a nice bonus. The light is really bright too, it is like a mini-flashlight + free backup batteries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Metal seems like good quality material and this is the cheapest tweezers I could find on amazon. Worth the price, I got it for like ~$2.40. I suggest these tweezers to pluck hairs with.</li>
            <li> Item arrived two weeks before estimated delivery date in perfect condition. Item was exactly as described and pictured. Works great for the price. Like the light it has. I use it for fine assembly I do at home.</li>
            <li> like all tweezers they do not squeeze tight enough but they do the job. The light does make it helpful.</li>
            <li> Revlon makes its own version of these tweezers for five times the price.  I figured I didn&#x27;t have much to lose, so I ordered one of these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tweezers are laughable.  They won&#x27;t tweeze anything but the finest hair, if that.  HOWEVER--all is not lost.  Truthfully, the little flashlight that comes with it is great!  Not only that, but there are THREE extra batteries included.  You won&#x27;t find a flashlight deal like this.  Would I buy it just for the flashlight?  Probably not, but now that I have it, I&#x27;ll keep it by the bed and I won&#x27;t ask for my money back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave it two stars because of the flashlight, but don&#x27;t order these for the tweezer part. That would be a definite one star.  Go to Walgreen&#x27;s and get the Revlon one.  The Revlon tweezers are fantastic, with or without the flashlight.  Use these just for the flashlight.</li>
            <li> The LED light works and is a great idea. The problem is the tweezers do not work--poor grip or no grip at all.</li>
            <li> Is OK but not more&lt;br /&gt;My wife has ordered 2 different brands&lt;br /&gt;Both came on time as expected&lt;br /&gt;one was perfect - has different review&lt;br /&gt;this one is just OK</li>
            <li> For the price, these little things are great. they even come with spare batteries.They were a hit with my scrapbooking friends.</li>
            <li> This is such an amazing item!  It it great tweezers and a nice bright light exactly where you need it.  I wish I had this when I had to remove a tick from my mom&#x27;s ear last month. Get this for new moms and dads, or anyone who ever uses tweezers!!</li>
            <li> great quality product and delivered on time.</li>
            <li> At first i didnt know if i would purchase this product but after doing a little research and even though i didnt really found much. I decided to order anyway, and i dont regret it, its a must have!! Great price, love product, fast shipping tottaly worth every penny..</li>
            <li> The light is great, which is usually what&#x27;s lacking in these types of tweezers. Sadly, the tweezers themselves couldn&#x27;t tweeze a course hair from an animal.</li>
