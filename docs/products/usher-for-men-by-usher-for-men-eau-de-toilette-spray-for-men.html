            <li>I have been purchasing cologne from them for the last year, and each bottle I received is beautiful wrapped, have been compared to department store bottles,Boxes, and the smell, and they ARE 100% legit!!!</li>
            <li>My already \\&quot;sexy and I know it\\&quot; attitude gets an ego boost (I appologize to all my family, friends, co-workers, and girlfriend as I make this purchase).</li>

            <li>I gave this five stars because i love the way it smells</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, this is where creative use comes to play.</li>
            <li>I love the way this smells, I&#x27;ve had women tell me I smell &amp;#34;So</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>

            <li>Will be buying more.</li>
            <li>Bought as a gift they love it</li>
            <li>Women can&#x27;t help but notice the smell of magic and of birth and motherhood around me...</li>
            <li>I got the product at home pretty quick and the price was very good.</li>
            <li>An old friend told me about this product, so I got it for my boyfriend &amp; he loved it !</li>
            <li>Through this seller I obtained a great smelling cologne, everyone always asks me what I am wearing because it smells so great, and I got it for half the price then you would at the mall or any place like that.</li>
            <li>good price and adorable smell , got a lot of positive feedback</li>
            <li>he is in the marine corps, and took it with him for training in another state because he loved it so much!</li>
            <li>its the best i have smelt in a long time.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money !!</li>
            <li>It was priced great for the size and shipped pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>Amazon offers it at a great price.</li>
            <li>/&gt;One more important thing to note</li>
            <li>Though it does not stay on for more than a day from my experience, it has a nice smell and is not expensive.</li>
            <li>The packaging was great and when I opened it I was surprised by the size of the bottle.</li>
            <li>I am 22 Years old Great smell...</li>
            <li>The smell was fantastic, I bought two models from this brand, and I love both.</li>
            <li>I have to put on two or three sprays to really get a good amount.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s worth it nice bottle</li>
            <li>Good buy, fast delivery.</li>
            <li>It came exactly as I had hoped, and is completely authentic!</li>
            <li>Its not overbearing but doesn&#x27;t wear off easily either.</li>
            <li>Fragrance isn&#x27;t that strong</li>
            <li>and it isn&#x27;t too strong.  </li>
            <li>It is not to strong, to over power you.</li>
            <li>Amazing ... was the real deal ! ...</li>
            <li>Love this cologne- smells great - smells professional, but also just right for a night out on the town.</li>
            <li>ok, this is the original great smelling stuff this will be my second bottle.  </li>
            <li>This is one of my boyfriends favorite smells, and I love it just as much!</li>
            <li>Shipping was pretty fast as well and and the bottle and packaging was in great conditioning.</li>
            <li>Quick delivery!</li>
            <li>I was not too sure what to expect; I had to trust the positive reviews that were posted by folks who had used it, and I am glad I did.</li>
            <li>And girls, either but some of this for your guy or get some for yourself because honestly, this is a gift of pure epicness.</li>
            <li>So I decided to try the Usher scent just because I felt a strong desire to, and I was not disappointed.</li>
            <li>The 3.4 ounce bottle is HUGE.</li>
            <li>Musky but light.</li>
            <li>Usher cologne is fantastic.</li>
            <li>,only lasts 5 minutes or less,even the smell is great</li>
            <li>: Fantastic, though people need to realize this is an Eau De Toilette and not a cologne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>once again enjoy your weekend and your day</li>
            <li>So good to be able to buy what you want and save money at the same time.</li>
            <li>Good smelling cologne for casual or formal wear.&lt;br /&gt;Price is probably the best part.</li>
            <li>This was an Xmas gift for my 16 year old son and he loves the  smell, I am thinking of getting one for me because it smells great plus the price is right,</li>
            <li>I really recommend it!!!</li>
            <li>It smells hot!!</li>
            <li>i willl be ordering this again very soon since i try never to run out!!!</li>
            <li>Really!!!  AYFKM.</li>
            <li>Smells very nice and last throughout the night.</li>
            <li>Presentation is very nice, and overall smell is outstanding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Smells good and masculine, sweet but not overly so.  </li>
            <li>Very intimate and sexy.</li>
            <li>Attention will be at your feet, and intriguing conversation awaits you!</li>
            <li>Smells wonderful my girl loves it definitely buying more as soon as possible</li>
            <li>My grandson will be excited about this product.</li>
            <li>and it was in original box wrapped in the shear plastic as well.  </li>
            <li>It is something that is unique.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a pretty safe buy.  </li>
            <li>Is that originally like that?</li>
            <li>box and bottle are masculine and attractive, and of course Usher (the singer) is popular with teen boys.  </li>
            <li>Worth every penny!</li>
            <li>It smells really good, light, fresh, clean, but still masculine.</li>
            <li>In my teens keeping clean wasn&#x27;t a priority and smelly clean too.</li>
            <li>The store was sold out of Usher, but luckily Amazon had it in stock (with free SuperSaver</li>
            <li>most women seem to comment positively about it though.</li>
            <li>It has a very clean smell without being too crisp, or waking you up every time the wearer walks by.</li>
            <li>because then I can spray the right amount all over without it being to strong or wasteful.</li>
            <li>stuff right here!</li>
            <li>I, of course, opened the box to check it out myself when it was delivered (which was fast) and I liked it very much too.  </li>
            <li>The product was shipped in great shape &amp; came sooner then expected.</li>
            <li>Highly Recommend! :)  </li>
            <li>old daughter also liked it.</li>
            <li>but it actually smells good</li>
            <li>I thought I would give this cologne a try as I was looking for a good priced daily cologne.  </li>
            <li>The reason i bought it because i tried it on  at the store and the smell lasted the whole day and smelt great,i love it,&lt;br /&gt;but</li>
            <li>I love it so much , I bought it for my husband</li>
            <li>It has a soft nice smell.  </li>
            <li>i gave this as achristmas present and was expecting that this perfume would smell really good</li>
            <li>i&#x27;ve been using this perfume for a couple of years, still love the smell as much as my lady does...</li>
            <li>i love this smell so much on my bf</li>
            <li>Bought it as a father&#x27;s day gift for my dad a couple years ago and he loved it enough to switch from another brand he had been using for years.</li>
            <li>Not bad.</li>
            <li>I received this cologne today, I have had it on my arm for around 3 hours already and the fragrance is almost as strong as when I first sprayed it on.  </li>
            <li>but other then that smells great.</li>
            <li>It has more of a youthful feel than some of the classic men&#x27;s fragrances.</li>
            <li>After I put some on it blended well with my body chemistry and had the best scent compared to my more expensive colognes, Calvin Klein, Armani etc.  </li>
            <li>I would say it&#x27;s more suite for older men.</li>
            <li>quick delivery too</li>
            <li>Great sexy but not long lasting</li>
            <li>One of my favorite cologne out there highly recommend this product to everyone.</li>
            <li>Very excited that I only paid 15 bucks for a huge bottle of Usher!</li>
            <li>smells good and lasts long</li>
            <li>It is a decent cologne but fades fast, it has a nice bottle cap.</li>
            <li>Love this one even more, smell lost for a long time</li>
            <li>Between mild to strong, it&#x27;s ok for daily use.</li>
            <li>First off, a lot of reviews on here complain that they received \\&quot;Knock-Off\\&quot; colognes!</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon!!</li>
            <li>Its so hot!</li>
            <li>This is my favorite cologne by far!</li>
            <li>works well, so far so good, still too new to know for sure!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update</li>
            <li>My husband liked it ok but told me not to buy him that fragrance anymore because it smelled like a weaker version of the one he previously sampled.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d have to disagree and say it has a very smooth fresh scent that is masculine and has sex appeal.</li>
            <li>It is a very good cologne on the heavy side (not too much though), but still fresh.</li>
            <li>Very woodsy yet light.</li>
            <li>This absolute fit the bill.</li>
            <li>It smells fantastic and buying it on Amazon was definitely much cheaper than buying it in a department store.</li>
            <li>It really has a nice masculine but not too woodsy smell.</li>
            <li>It was worth it tho.</li>
            <li>This was definitely worth rating 5 stars.  </li>
            <li>and you&#x27;re golden.</li>
            <li>Refreshing, classy smell.</li>
            <li>I always get compliments from people at work about how it smells, even from one of the most feared, leathery old managers that we have.</li>
            <li>Worth the money and a lot cheaper here then anywhere else.</li>
            <li>Take that  for what its worth.</li>
            <li>Not even worth the 30$ for 100mL.</li>
            <li>Our teen son has outgrown Axe (thank God) and asked me to find him some kind of cologne.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a nice cologne for the teen or man in your life, give this one a sniff.</li>
            <li>It was pretty quick delivery.</li>
            <li>dont waste your time with walmart when u get more bang for your buck jack !!</li>
            <li>This was packaged just like the original, has to be the real thing.</li>
            <li>Other than that it&#x27;s all good....</li>
            <li>At first, he was not super thrilled about it being a signature cologne from a pop star, but it was love at first whiff.</li>
            <li>I ordered the 3.7 oz on friday and right now it is Wednesday.</li>
            <li>Shipping time was right on.</li>
            <li>Buy right now.</li>
            <li>RIGHT</li>
            <li>I received it right on time.</li>
            <li>right away I knew this was the one.  </li>
            <li>That cologne has just the right touch.</li>
            <li>I would pay $100 for this one and the price here is the best price by far to every other place I have seen it at!!!</li>
            <li>This came in a large box full of packaging peanuts which I promptly spilled all over the living room.</li>
            <li>Fragrance is nice but doesnt stay for long.</li>
            <li>it weak smell very good</li>
            <li>Non offensive, it actually smells great, at a low price.</li>
            <li>shipping!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s got a clean, classy scent that doesn&#x27;t overpower, and even spraying it on in a cloud the way teen boys do, he smells nice.  </li>
            <li>it has a great smell but it only last for like 1 hour</li>
            <li>Maybe it&#x27;s better to pay a little more and get legitimate, REAL products!</li>
            <li>While that may freak you out, it manages to pack a pretty manly smelling punch in there at the same time, which is what makes this such a great fragrance.</li>
            <li>, shipping is very fast.</li>
            <li>This is some real fragrance that is musty and masculine for the ladies to enjoy, it isn&#x27;t any little boy axe or ed hardy scent, it&#x27;s a real sexy guy scent,</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty stoked about that.</li>
            <li>and this was a surprise when I first smelled it at the store</li>
            <li>Overall, I am extremely pleased with this purchase for it&#x27;s intended</li>
            <li>You only need one or two sprays at the most.</li>
            <li>I had to find a quality fragrance for my teenager, as he is very generous when using it!  </li>
            <li>Will definitely buy this product for a friend :)</li>
            <li>It was my first time purchasing a fragrance.  </li>
            <li>Usher has done job of combining masculine, but not overbearing, light, fruit, musk all in one.</li>
            <li>had my speculations at first come one usher cologne</li>
            <li>Prices are much higher in department stores.</li>
            <li>Not a real complaint, but I do get &amp;#34;sniffed&amp;#34; a lot as others enjoy the cologne.</li>
            <li>Funny</li>
            <li>this is such a sexy smell.</li>
            <li>;-)</li>
            <li>It was exactly as stated.</li>
            <li>and I enjoy that action.  </li>
            <li>I would most likely buy it again...</li>
            <li>I hope the girls like it as much as I do!</li>
            <li>but I find myself wearing Usher&#x27;s cologne more daily.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;this is the first time using this cologne and everyone around my seems to like it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would definitely Buy more colognes from this company.</li>
            <li>I instantly fell I love with it</li>
            <li>I would say that I&#x27;ve smelled scents like this one before, but I don&#x27;t know anyone who wears this exact scent.</li>
            <li>I paid half the price and very pleased with the fragrance.</li>
            <li>On first wear the middle notes smelled exactly like Davidoff Adventure, which is a good thing, but I did not get this at all on my 2nd wearing.</li>
            <li>Its subtle yet smells great.</li>
            <li>Has been my favorite cologne for a long time.</li>
            <li>I ordered another bottle of this sweet masculine unicorn aroma to ensure I can continue to build my utopia.</li>
            <li>so I needed to find a new bottle to get my fix on (again ;)!  </li>
            <li>thought would help me dance and sing like usher but that was kind of a let down</li>
            <li>We go to various restaurants, and I don&#x27;t want to smell up the car with a strong cologne.</li>
            <li>Has a large fragance..</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m writing this because in order to leave a review I must have a certain amount of words in my review.</li>
            <li>And for the current selling price, you really can&#x27;t beat a cologne that doesn&#x27;t smell as cheap as it&#x27;s price tag.</li>
            <li>Its a huge bottle of 3+ ounces and is the same cost of what Ive been buying.</li>
            <li>The smell is amazing, its simple and its necessary.</li>
            <li>I only considered his brand, status and appearance as indication that the scent would have a &amp;#34;sexy&amp;#34;, light scent (along with the product description).</li>
            <li>This seller is very reliable</li>
            <li>He&#x27;s very choosy about what he wears</li>
            <li>Usher is a very forgiving scent, as it doesn&#x27;t become offensive unless the wearer applies way too much.</li>
            <li>Very affordable as well.</li>
            <li>Came in fast, probably within 2 weeks.</li>
            <li>Very versatile.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The real thing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the real thing, they had a sampler bottle that I tried out.</li>
            <li>I really like the fragrance and as others have noted the scent lasts all day.</li>
            <li>Also spray cap is very decorative and quite weighty.</li>
            <li>how much he loves it.</li>
            <li>But it shows how much people like it.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really surprise me.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Up until now, I don&#x27;t use it that much because the smell doesn&#x27;t stick that long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I ordered this bottle because the price is much cheaper.  </li>
            <li>The quality of the bottle is also really well done.  </li>
            <li>arrived on time, smells really good,too.</li>
            <li>Thanks so&lt;br /&gt;Much.</li>
            <li>Shipment was very quck also.  </li>
            <li>Very sastified,good product and promt service,thank you guys.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t really smell it</li>
            <li>While my country star colognes do well also, this one is a secret weapon among my stash of great smells.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Every where else was just twice as much.</li>
            <li>The scent was better than I expected.</li>
            <li>Item is as it was described, thanks.</li>
            <li>And I got it so fast.</li>
            <li>/&gt;i would buy this again , thanks</li>
            <li>and I found it so much cheaper than a store.</li>
            <li>I smelled about 20 seizure-inducing drug-store colognes and was ready to take my headache and go home when I saw a tester bottle of Usher on the shelf.  </li>
            <li>The price is reasonable too.  </li>
            <li>haha.</li>
            <li>but i don&#x27;t really like the scent.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;m around very often and close with.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t like the smell to much either.</li>
            <li>so this seems like the real deal.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t nearly as strong as the original and doesn&#x27;t last long at all.  </li>
            <li>But when you can find it at a price point lower than most other merchants offer this product for, you&#x27;ve hit a home run.</li>
            <li>Not only was I excited about</li>
            <li>I am white with light brown hair and blue eyes and it feels good on me, but I think it will be much better for black guys or dark skin/hair people.</li>
            <li>The short and sweet of it.</li>
            <li>love the black bottle</li>
            <li>, this is my main cologne for going out and going to work.</li>
            <li>Cheap and nice smelling cologne just can&#x27;t go wrong here.</li>
            <li>I do not, however, think any guy that&#x27;s about 35 or older should wear this...</li>
            <li>must have an its classic well done usher</li>
            <li>/&gt;Smells decent but the cologne is burned by people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The only problem is I think it fades to quickly.</li>
            <li>On the positive side it does have a clean and sweet scent it simply does not last much beyond the initial spray.</li>
            <li>Very masculine!</li>
            <li>Exactly what I expected and it arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>i would highly recommend this if not another version of this</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this item to anyone.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this one.</li>
            <li>&gt; Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I had high expectations from this considering the reviews I saw on amazon</li>
            <li>It even came with a free mirror (I don&#x27;t know why they&#x27;d give you a pink mirror with a guy&#x27;s cologne..</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, P. Diddy&#x27;s is great</li>
            <li>Great Smelling Cologne with the exception that it leaks from the seal and is unable to be returned.</li>
            <li>They sell it for $40 plus tax at a normal store but got it cheaper here.</li>
            <li>Works well for a work cologne that I don&#x27;t want to waste my favorite cologne on.</li>
            <li>I was very happy to find a big bottle of my husbands favorite fragrance at the same price for the small bottle that only lasts a few weeks.  </li>
            <li>This perfume does not even last an hour after applying it which pretty much beats the purpose of having it.</li>
            <li>My secret Santa loved it and told me his dad would come in his room just to put it on.</li>
            <li>I was a little worried about purchasing a fragrance online, however,  I was not disappointed with this product!</li>
            <li>product came on time as scheduled sealed unopened brand new..</li>
            <li>IT LIVE UP TO EXPECTATION....</li>
            <li>I 100% recommend this for buyers looking for a new smell and to use this seller.</li>
            <li>i even bought it for my new boyfriend</li>
            <li>Never had a complaint,  only good words from people.</li>
            <li>for those that dont know, they have super limited space</li>
            <li>I accept responsibility for ordering this without having first smelled the scent in a local department store.</li>
            <li>I am now buying his second bottle as he is already out of the first.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised!</li>
            <li>I have used Usher in the past and is my favorite cologne.  </li>
            <li>thing I am not sure is the top decoration things is rotating.</li>
            <li>the price I&#x27;ve paid for it in the past :)</li>
            <li>; maybe old age I&#x27;m 49!</li>
            <li>Too light for me and doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my husband who loved the original one I bought, but it was so expensive at the other place.</li>
            <li>but not good enough,not very strong</li>
            <li>The only thing that caught my attention was the top of the cap has scratches and the bottle is a little scuffed.</li>
            <li>Bought this for my 19 yr old grandson for Christmas and he loves it.  </li>
            <li>It never gets old and isn&#x27;t over powering.</li>
            <li>Like Old Spice.</li>
            <li>I was not so surprised that my 20 yr.</li>
            <li>Actual cologne, not a &amp;#34;China scent.&amp;#34; Much much cheaper than any department store.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s if cologne can get old</li>
            <li>IT was a big hit with a very dear friend who is like my dad.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li>Diluted or old product.  </li>
            <li>This purchase from Amazon seems to be old stock.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking to get a 15-30 year old guy</li>
            <li>I chose this to give it to my boyfriend (30 years old).</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too loud.</li>
            <li>My grandson is 15 years old.  </li>
            <li>very menly, in a mysterious way.</li>
            <li>he doesnt know my old boyfriend wore it and he will never know.</li>
            <li>nothing really intoxicating as the young guys or mid early 20s would like to get arouse the girls.</li>
            <li>far as people talking about &amp;#34;fake&amp;#34; scents, I sprayed a paper towel once about an hour ago</li>
            <li>I was an avid user of axe body spray, but as I grew into my early 20&#x27;s meant I had to reach for a cologne that provide a scent that lasted long, with out me spraying every 3-4 hours.</li>
            <li>This is a big bottle only $25, definitely way worth it!</li>
            <li>Instead of just squirting a narrow spritz straight onto the skin the spray delivers a very fine mist which envolopes into a wide cloud and just hangs in midair for a second.  </li>
            <li>so I use it rarely along with my other Colognes</li>
            <li>anyone would suggest that it is for younger men, or just for the older ones.</li>
            <li>: product worked really well, no major complaints!</li>
            <li>The price on Amazon was 1/2 the cost of our local high end department store.</li>
            <li>I was using Perry Ellis Portfolio in the black bottle which matches well but smells a little more peppery than sweet and a stronger scent.  </li>
            <li>but it was more than half empty.</li>
            <li>I got exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li>I ordered it, received it, &amp; got EXACTLY what I expected:  </li>
            <li>My husband has worn the same type of cologne for years and he was hesitant to try something new but after wearing it a couple of times he started getting lots of compliments at work.      </li>
            <li>BTW, I&#x27;m a 30 yr old male, I feel this cologne can be for males</li>
            <li>But, then again, my fifteen year old might be spraying some on multiple times a day and twice before bed . .</li>
            <li>I am 46 years old and started wearing this at the suggestion of my teenage girls.</li>
            <li>- I just cant get enough of him - wow</li>
            <li>For me, this particular Usher for Men product did not provide the strength and longevity of  flagrance that I expected to receive.  </li>
            <li>Go compliments first few days I started using it.</li>
            <li>I had to get used to holding the bottle further away than I usually do to apply cologne because the fragrance is so strong and the spray mist is wide.    </li>
            <li>Only buy this cologne if you want a watered down version of the real stuff.</li>
            <li>Go to a store in your local mall and buy a real one, unless you want the watered down version.</li>
            <li>I wanted something other people don&#x27;t normally have and chose this one as a choice off the reviews</li>
            <li>A generic drug store scent, not very long lasting.</li>
            <li>But the fruit basically disappears after a few minutes and the top notes are hardly noticeable.</li>

            <li> I have been purchasing cologne from them for the last year, and each bottle I received is beautiful wrapped, have been compared to department store bottles,Boxes, and the smell, and they ARE 100% legit!!!</li>
            <li> My already \\&quot;sexy and I know it\\&quot; attitude gets an ego boost (I appologize to all my family, friends, co-workers, and girlfriend as I make this purchase).</li>

            <li> My husband sprayed it on himself 5 times and I was barely able to smell anything, and that was with my nose stuck up to his neck.</li>
            <li> In my opinion, that&#x27;s their way of just scamming people even more.</li>
            <li> but hey, free stuff!)</li>

            <li> Through this seller I obtained a great smelling cologne, everyone always asks me what I am wearing because it smells so great, and I got it for half the price then you would at the mall or any place like that.</li>
            <li> good price and adorable smell , got a lot of positive feedback</li>
            <li> he is in the marine corps, and took it with him for training in another state because he loved it so much!</li>
            <li> its the best i have smelt in a long time.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the money !!</li>
            <li> It was priced great for the size and shipped pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> Amazon offers it at a great price.</li>
            <li> /&gt;One more important thing to note</li>
            <li> Though it does not stay on for more than a day from my experience, it has a nice smell and is not expensive.</li>
            <li> The packaging was great and when I opened it I was surprised by the size of the bottle.</li>
            <li> I am 22 Years old Great smell...</li>
            <li> The smell was fantastic, I bought two models from this brand, and I love both.</li>
            <li> I have to put on two or three sprays to really get a good amount.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s worth it nice bottle</li>
            <li> Good buy, fast delivery.</li>
            <li> It came exactly as I had hoped, and is completely authentic!</li>
            <li> Its not overbearing but doesn&#x27;t wear off easily either.</li>
            <li> Fragrance isn&#x27;t that strong</li>
            <li> and it isn&#x27;t too strong.  </li>
            <li> It is not to strong, to over power you.</li>
            <li> Amazing ... was the real deal ! ...</li>
            <li> Love this cologne- smells great - smells professional, but also just right for a night out on the town.</li>
            <li> ok, this is the original great smelling stuff this will be my second bottle.  </li>
            <li> This is one of my boyfriends favorite smells, and I love it just as much!</li>
            <li> Shipping was pretty fast as well and and the bottle and packaging was in great conditioning.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery!</li>
            <li> I was not too sure what to expect; I had to trust the positive reviews that were posted by folks who had used it, and I am glad I did.</li>
            <li> And girls, either but some of this for your guy or get some for yourself because honestly, this is a gift of pure epicness.</li>
            <li> So I decided to try the Usher scent just because I felt a strong desire to, and I was not disappointed.</li>
            <li> The 3.4 ounce bottle is HUGE.</li>
            <li> Musky but light.</li>
            <li> Usher cologne is fantastic.</li>
            <li> ,only lasts 5 minutes or less,even the smell is great</li>
            <li> : Fantastic, though people need to realize this is an Eau De Toilette and not a cologne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> once again enjoy your weekend and your day</li>
            <li> So good to be able to buy what you want and save money at the same time.</li>
            <li> Good smelling cologne for casual or formal wear.&lt;br /&gt;Price is probably the best part.</li>
            <li> This was an Xmas gift for my 16 year old son and he loves the  smell, I am thinking of getting one for me because it smells great plus the price is right,</li>
            <li> I really recommend it!!!</li>
            <li> It smells hot!!</li>
            <li> i willl be ordering this again very soon since i try never to run out!!!</li>
            <li> Really!!!  AYFKM.</li>
            <li> Smells very nice and last throughout the night.</li>
            <li> Presentation is very nice, and overall smell is outstanding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Smells good and masculine, sweet but not overly so.  </li>
            <li> Very intimate and sexy.</li>
            <li> Attention will be at your feet, and intriguing conversation awaits you!</li>
            <li> Smells wonderful my girl loves it definitely buying more as soon as possible</li>
            <li> My grandson will be excited about this product.</li>
            <li> and it was in original box wrapped in the shear plastic as well.  </li>
            <li> It is something that is unique.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a pretty safe buy.  </li>
            <li> Is that originally like that?</li>
            <li> box and bottle are masculine and attractive, and of course Usher (the singer) is popular with teen boys.  </li>
            <li> Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> It smells really good, light, fresh, clean, but still masculine.</li>
            <li> In my teens keeping clean wasn&#x27;t a priority and smelly clean too.</li>
            <li> The store was sold out of Usher, but luckily Amazon had it in stock (with free SuperSaver</li>
            <li> most women seem to comment positively about it though.</li>
            <li> It has a very clean smell without being too crisp, or waking you up every time the wearer walks by.</li>
            <li> because then I can spray the right amount all over without it being to strong or wasteful.</li>
            <li> stuff right here!</li>
            <li> I, of course, opened the box to check it out myself when it was delivered (which was fast) and I liked it very much too.  </li>
            <li> The product was shipped in great shape &amp; came sooner then expected.</li>
            <li> Highly Recommend! :)  </li>
            <li> old daughter also liked it.</li>
            <li> but it actually smells good</li>
            <li> I thought I would give this cologne a try as I was looking for a good priced daily cologne.  </li>
            <li> The reason i bought it because i tried it on  at the store and the smell lasted the whole day and smelt great,i love it,&lt;br /&gt;but</li>
            <li> I love it so much , I bought it for my husband</li>
            <li> It has a soft nice smell.  </li>
            <li> i gave this as achristmas present and was expecting that this perfume would smell really good</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve been using this perfume for a couple of years, still love the smell as much as my lady does...</li>
            <li> i love this smell so much on my bf</li>
            <li> Bought it as a father&#x27;s day gift for my dad a couple years ago and he loved it enough to switch from another brand he had been using for years.</li>
            <li> Not bad.</li>
            <li> I received this cologne today, I have had it on my arm for around 3 hours already and the fragrance is almost as strong as when I first sprayed it on.  </li>
            <li> but other then that smells great.</li>
            <li> It has more of a youthful feel than some of the classic men&#x27;s fragrances.</li>
            <li> After I put some on it blended well with my body chemistry and had the best scent compared to my more expensive colognes, Calvin Klein, Armani etc.  </li>
            <li> I would say it&#x27;s more suite for older men.</li>
            <li> quick delivery too</li>
            <li> Great sexy but not long lasting</li>
            <li> One of my favorite cologne out there highly recommend this product to everyone.</li>
            <li> Very excited that I only paid 15 bucks for a huge bottle of Usher!</li>
            <li> smells good and lasts long</li>
            <li> It is a decent cologne but fades fast, it has a nice bottle cap.</li>
            <li> Love this one even more, smell lost for a long time</li>
            <li> Between mild to strong, it&#x27;s ok for daily use.</li>
            <li> First off, a lot of reviews on here complain that they received \\&quot;Knock-Off\\&quot; colognes!</li>
            <li> Thanks Amazon!!</li>
            <li> Its so hot!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite cologne by far!</li>
            <li> works well, so far so good, still too new to know for sure!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update</li>
            <li> My husband liked it ok but told me not to buy him that fragrance anymore because it smelled like a weaker version of the one he previously sampled.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d have to disagree and say it has a very smooth fresh scent that is masculine and has sex appeal.</li>
            <li> It is a very good cologne on the heavy side (not too much though), but still fresh.</li>
            <li> Very woodsy yet light.</li>
            <li> This absolute fit the bill.</li>
            <li> It smells fantastic and buying it on Amazon was definitely much cheaper than buying it in a department store.</li>
            <li> It really has a nice masculine but not too woodsy smell.</li>
            <li> It was worth it tho.</li>
            <li> This was definitely worth rating 5 stars.  </li>
            <li> and you&#x27;re golden.</li>
            <li> Refreshing, classy smell.</li>
            <li> I always get compliments from people at work about how it smells, even from one of the most feared, leathery old managers that we have.</li>
            <li> Worth the money and a lot cheaper here then anywhere else.</li>
            <li> Take that  for what its worth.</li>
            <li> Not even worth the 30$ for 100mL.</li>
            <li> Our teen son has outgrown Axe (thank God) and asked me to find him some kind of cologne.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a nice cologne for the teen or man in your life, give this one a sniff.</li>
            <li> It was pretty quick delivery.</li>
            <li> dont waste your time with walmart when u get more bang for your buck jack !!</li>
            <li> This was packaged just like the original, has to be the real thing.</li>
            <li> Other than that it&#x27;s all good....</li>
            <li> At first, he was not super thrilled about it being a signature cologne from a pop star, but it was love at first whiff.</li>
            <li> I ordered the 3.7 oz on friday and right now it is Wednesday.</li>
            <li> Shipping time was right on.</li>
            <li> Buy right now.</li>
            <li> RIGHT</li>
            <li> I received it right on time.</li>
            <li> right away I knew this was the one.  </li>
            <li> That cologne has just the right touch.</li>
            <li> I would pay $100 for this one and the price here is the best price by far to every other place I have seen it at!!!</li>
            <li> This came in a large box full of packaging peanuts which I promptly spilled all over the living room.</li>
            <li> Fragrance is nice but doesnt stay for long.</li>
            <li> it weak smell very good</li>
            <li> Non offensive, it actually smells great, at a low price.</li>
            <li> shipping!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s got a clean, classy scent that doesn&#x27;t overpower, and even spraying it on in a cloud the way teen boys do, he smells nice.  </li>
            <li> it has a great smell but it only last for like 1 hour</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s better to pay a little more and get legitimate, REAL products!</li>
            <li> While that may freak you out, it manages to pack a pretty manly smelling punch in there at the same time, which is what makes this such a great fragrance.</li>
            <li> , shipping is very fast.</li>
            <li> This is some real fragrance that is musty and masculine for the ladies to enjoy, it isn&#x27;t any little boy axe or ed hardy scent, it&#x27;s a real sexy guy scent,</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty stoked about that.</li>
            <li> and this was a surprise when I first smelled it at the store</li>
            <li> Overall, I am extremely pleased with this purchase for it&#x27;s intended</li>
            <li> You only need one or two sprays at the most.</li>
            <li> I had to find a quality fragrance for my teenager, as he is very generous when using it!  </li>
            <li> Will definitely buy this product for a friend :)</li>
            <li> It was my first time purchasing a fragrance.  </li>
            <li> Usher has done job of combining masculine, but not overbearing, light, fruit, musk all in one.</li>
            <li> had my speculations at first come one usher cologne</li>
            <li> Prices are much higher in department stores.</li>
            <li> Not a real complaint, but I do get &amp;#34;sniffed&amp;#34; a lot as others enjoy the cologne.</li>
            <li> Funny</li>
            <li> this is such a sexy smell.</li>
            <li> ;-)</li>
            <li> It was exactly as stated.</li>
            <li> and I enjoy that action.  </li>
            <li> I would most likely buy it again...</li>
            <li> I hope the girls like it as much as I do!</li>
            <li> but I find myself wearing Usher&#x27;s cologne more daily.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;this is the first time using this cologne and everyone around my seems to like it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would definitely Buy more colognes from this company.</li>
            <li> I instantly fell I love with it</li>
            <li> I would say that I&#x27;ve smelled scents like this one before, but I don&#x27;t know anyone who wears this exact scent.</li>
            <li> I paid half the price and very pleased with the fragrance.</li>
            <li> On first wear the middle notes smelled exactly like Davidoff Adventure, which is a good thing, but I did not get this at all on my 2nd wearing.</li>
            <li> Its subtle yet smells great.</li>
            <li> Has been my favorite cologne for a long time.</li>
            <li> I ordered another bottle of this sweet masculine unicorn aroma to ensure I can continue to build my utopia.</li>
            <li> so I needed to find a new bottle to get my fix on (again ;)!  </li>
            <li> thought would help me dance and sing like usher but that was kind of a let down</li>
            <li> We go to various restaurants, and I don&#x27;t want to smell up the car with a strong cologne.</li>
            <li> Has a large fragance..</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m writing this because in order to leave a review I must have a certain amount of words in my review.</li>
            <li> And for the current selling price, you really can&#x27;t beat a cologne that doesn&#x27;t smell as cheap as it&#x27;s price tag.</li>
            <li> Its a huge bottle of 3+ ounces and is the same cost of what Ive been buying.</li>
            <li> The smell is amazing, its simple and its necessary.</li>
            <li> I only considered his brand, status and appearance as indication that the scent would have a &amp;#34;sexy&amp;#34;, light scent (along with the product description).</li>
            <li> This seller is very reliable</li>
            <li> He&#x27;s very choosy about what he wears</li>
            <li> Usher is a very forgiving scent, as it doesn&#x27;t become offensive unless the wearer applies way too much.</li>
            <li> Very affordable as well.</li>
            <li> Came in fast, probably within 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> Very versatile.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The real thing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the real thing, they had a sampler bottle that I tried out.</li>
            <li> I really like the fragrance and as others have noted the scent lasts all day.</li>
            <li> Also spray cap is very decorative and quite weighty.</li>
            <li> how much he loves it.</li>
            <li> But it shows how much people like it.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really surprise me.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Up until now, I don&#x27;t use it that much because the smell doesn&#x27;t stick that long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I ordered this bottle because the price is much cheaper.  </li>
            <li> The quality of the bottle is also really well done.  </li>
            <li> arrived on time, smells really good,too.</li>
            <li> Thanks so&lt;br /&gt;Much.</li>
            <li> Shipment was very quck also.  </li>
            <li> Very sastified,good product and promt service,thank you guys.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t really smell it</li>
            <li> While my country star colognes do well also, this one is a secret weapon among my stash of great smells.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Every where else was just twice as much.</li>
            <li> The scent was better than I expected.</li>
            <li> Item is as it was described, thanks.</li>
            <li> And I got it so fast.</li>
            <li> /&gt;i would buy this again , thanks</li>
            <li> and I found it so much cheaper than a store.</li>
            <li> I smelled about 20 seizure-inducing drug-store colognes and was ready to take my headache and go home when I saw a tester bottle of Usher on the shelf.  </li>
            <li> The price is reasonable too.  </li>
            <li> haha.</li>
            <li> but i don&#x27;t really like the scent.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m around very often and close with.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like the smell to much either.</li>
            <li> so this seems like the real deal.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t nearly as strong as the original and doesn&#x27;t last long at all.  </li>
            <li> But when you can find it at a price point lower than most other merchants offer this product for, you&#x27;ve hit a home run.</li>
            <li> Not only was I excited about</li>
            <li> I am white with light brown hair and blue eyes and it feels good on me, but I think it will be much better for black guys or dark skin/hair people.</li>
            <li> The short and sweet of it.</li>
            <li> love the black bottle</li>
            <li> , this is my main cologne for going out and going to work.</li>
            <li> Cheap and nice smelling cologne just can&#x27;t go wrong here.</li>
            <li> I do not, however, think any guy that&#x27;s about 35 or older should wear this...</li>
            <li> must have an its classic well done usher</li>
            <li> /&gt;Smells decent but the cologne is burned by people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The only problem is I think it fades to quickly.</li>
            <li> On the positive side it does have a clean and sweet scent it simply does not last much beyond the initial spray.</li>
            <li> Very masculine!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected and it arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> i would highly recommend this if not another version of this</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this item to anyone.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this one.</li>
            <li> &gt; Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I had high expectations from this considering the reviews I saw on amazon</li>
            <li> It even came with a free mirror (I don&#x27;t know why they&#x27;d give you a pink mirror with a guy&#x27;s cologne..</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong, P. Diddy&#x27;s is great</li>
            <li> Great Smelling Cologne with the exception that it leaks from the seal and is unable to be returned.</li>
            <li> They sell it for $40 plus tax at a normal store but got it cheaper here.</li>
            <li> Works well for a work cologne that I don&#x27;t want to waste my favorite cologne on.</li>
            <li> I was very happy to find a big bottle of my husbands favorite fragrance at the same price for the small bottle that only lasts a few weeks.  </li>
            <li> This perfume does not even last an hour after applying it which pretty much beats the purpose of having it.</li>
            <li> My secret Santa loved it and told me his dad would come in his room just to put it on.</li>
            <li> I was a little worried about purchasing a fragrance online, however,  I was not disappointed with this product!</li>
            <li> product came on time as scheduled sealed unopened brand new..</li>
            <li> IT LIVE UP TO EXPECTATION....</li>
            <li> I 100% recommend this for buyers looking for a new smell and to use this seller.</li>
            <li> i even bought it for my new boyfriend</li>
            <li> Never had a complaint,  only good words from people.</li>
            <li> for those that dont know, they have super limited space</li>
            <li> I accept responsibility for ordering this without having first smelled the scent in a local department store.</li>
            <li> I am now buying his second bottle as he is already out of the first.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised!</li>
            <li> I have used Usher in the past and is my favorite cologne.  </li>
            <li> thing I am not sure is the top decoration things is rotating.</li>
            <li> the price I&#x27;ve paid for it in the past :)</li>
            <li> ; maybe old age I&#x27;m 49!</li>
            <li> Too light for me and doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband who loved the original one I bought, but it was so expensive at the other place.</li>
            <li> but not good enough,not very strong</li>
            <li> The only thing that caught my attention was the top of the cap has scratches and the bottle is a little scuffed.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my 19 yr old grandson for Christmas and he loves it.  </li>
            <li> It never gets old and isn&#x27;t over powering.</li>
            <li> Like Old Spice.</li>
            <li> I was not so surprised that my 20 yr.</li>
            <li> Actual cologne, not a &amp;#34;China scent.&amp;#34; Much much cheaper than any department store.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s if cologne can get old</li>
            <li> IT was a big hit with a very dear friend who is like my dad.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li> Diluted or old product.  </li>
            <li> This purchase from Amazon seems to be old stock.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking to get a 15-30 year old guy</li>
            <li> I chose this to give it to my boyfriend (30 years old).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too loud.</li>
            <li> My grandson is 15 years old.  </li>
            <li> very menly, in a mysterious way.</li>
            <li> he doesnt know my old boyfriend wore it and he will never know.</li>
            <li> nothing really intoxicating as the young guys or mid early 20s would like to get arouse the girls.</li>
            <li> far as people talking about &amp;#34;fake&amp;#34; scents, I sprayed a paper towel once about an hour ago</li>
            <li> I was an avid user of axe body spray, but as I grew into my early 20&#x27;s meant I had to reach for a cologne that provide a scent that lasted long, with out me spraying every 3-4 hours.</li>
            <li> This is a big bottle only $25, definitely way worth it!</li>
            <li> Instead of just squirting a narrow spritz straight onto the skin the spray delivers a very fine mist which envolopes into a wide cloud and just hangs in midair for a second.  </li>
            <li> so I use it rarely along with my other Colognes</li>
            <li> anyone would suggest that it is for younger men, or just for the older ones.</li>
            <li> : product worked really well, no major complaints!</li>
            <li> The price on Amazon was 1/2 the cost of our local high end department store.</li>
            <li> I was using Perry Ellis Portfolio in the black bottle which matches well but smells a little more peppery than sweet and a stronger scent.  </li>
            <li> but it was more than half empty.</li>
            <li> I got exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> I ordered it, received it, &amp; got EXACTLY what I expected:  </li>
            <li> My husband has worn the same type of cologne for years and he was hesitant to try something new but after wearing it a couple of times he started getting lots of compliments at work.      </li>
            <li> BTW, I&#x27;m a 30 yr old male, I feel this cologne can be for males</li>
            <li> But, then again, my fifteen year old might be spraying some on multiple times a day and twice before bed . .</li>
            <li> I am 46 years old and started wearing this at the suggestion of my teenage girls.</li>
            <li> - I just cant get enough of him - wow</li>
            <li> For me, this particular Usher for Men product did not provide the strength and longevity of  flagrance that I expected to receive.  </li>
            <li> Go compliments first few days I started using it.</li>
            <li> I had to get used to holding the bottle further away than I usually do to apply cologne because the fragrance is so strong and the spray mist is wide.    </li>
            <li> Only buy this cologne if you want a watered down version of the real stuff.</li>
            <li> Go to a store in your local mall and buy a real one, unless you want the watered down version.</li>
            <li> I wanted something other people don&#x27;t normally have and chose this one as a choice off the reviews</li>
            <li> A generic drug store scent, not very long lasting.</li>
            <li> But the fruit basically disappears after a few minutes and the top notes are hardly noticeable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 21 year old college student and have gotten a lot of compliments from the girl friend, as well as other people.</li>
            <li> , it may not last long enough for some however.</li>
            <li> Does not have same smell and does not last long in comparison to one bought from Macy&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> and then it&#x27;s pretty hard to detect.</li>
            <li> Overall, it will last a very long time.</li>
            <li> But it does not last as long as I thought it would for the price.</li>
            <li> thought this will last for long, I think they just added water.</li>
            <li> : The smell doesn&#x27;t last overly long.</li>
            <li> Product is exactly what you see In the retail environment but cost less than half.</li>
            <li> I go through no other Cologne/Perfume seller other then \\&quot;FragranceNet\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> and I can only find the .5 and 1.0 oz in most stores for a crazy price.</li>
            <li> Wow, Usher really stepped his game up with this cologne.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this scent for my husband last Christmas and spent over $65.00 on a smaller amount.  </li>
            <li> I spent the extra time reading reviews from people regarding the scent and effectiveness of various colognes and made a hurried decision at the end to mark this one as a known choice from others I&#x27;ve never heard of.</li>
            <li> I bought this on a whim last Christmas for my fifteen year old son who loves to smell nice, and I was getting tired of all of the expensive and overpowering soaps he was asking me to buy.</li>
            <li> The aroma of the cologne when sprayed lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I think this was on the shelf too long.</li>
            <li> Lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I like usher a lot, i have used this for a long time</li>
            <li> Fragrance lasts for a long time.</li>
            <li> then what we expected i will definantly be buying another in the future!</li>
            <li> Lasts about as long as a body spray.</li>
            <li> Lasts me all day long!</li>
            <li> I have never had a single person not like it.</li>
            <li> Even with a low price of $20, not worth the money.</li>
            <li> They obviously water this cologne down then sell it at a discount price.</li>
            <li> This item was given as a gift because the recipient has previously bought it and was running low.  </li>
            <li> In the mall or store it usually cost double, especially for the amount you get.</li>
            <li> It is something you should wear casually and on less important days.</li>
            <li> No complaints or regrets</li>
            <li> /&gt;lasts about an hour or two but stays on your clothes for a day or two with minimal</li>
            <li> Just use a few sprays in key locations like sides of the neck...</li>
            <li> Mainly my dad, I honestly never seen him go on &amp; on about a cologne like he has about Usher!</li>
            <li> I usually find this product in the smaller bottles and was a little concerned about the larger quantity.  </li>
            <li> It smells just like the cologne purchased from Macys and other stores.  </li>
            <li> I usually go through there there Online site, but recently seen they sell through Amazon too!</li>
            <li> I usually buy this at a local store for around $20 for the 1 oz bottle.</li>
            <li> and a couple samples of other colognes.     </li>
            <li> I bought a small sample of this at WalMart to check it out since it was the only mens cologne that was always almost sold out.  </li>
            <li> I saw it at Walgreens first but thought the price was a tad expensive, so I decided to go with the tried and proven Amazone.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten compliments from other people as well while wearing it.</li>
            <li> I have to say at first I was skeptical</li>
            <li> I have spent $30 on half the size off the shelf.</li>
            <li> but i didnt order a half empty spray.</li>
            <li> I ordered this from Amazon as their price was much less expensive than the store where I had first tested it.    </li>
            <li> The scent doesn&#x27;t seem to last as long as those I&#x27;ve bought in the store as if it&#x27;s watered down or just weak</li>
            <li> If it is original because It loses its smell after less than an hour, this is the reason to give one star, sounds like a fake product</li>
            <li> I love Amazon.com as I hate to shop</li>
            <li> the reason I took it down on rating is the fact that this product has poor longevity and on the weaker side as far as strength.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So if you buy this and yours is also watered down like mine</li>
            <li> the usher black</li>
            <li> But Usher smells goes away in less of 20 min.</li>
            <li> The only drawback is that I think the smell is just a little weak.</li>
            <li> ,It took a little time to get the order</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased other bottles of this fragrance for him in the past.</li>
            <li> but if you can save a little and buy quality cologne from a department store</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my little brother and he loves it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Usher beats nautica and axe hands down!</li>
            <li> I went through a few of them .</li>
            <li> I do not know why Amazon would give out a product or let a product sold that is not genuine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a Creed man but was in the market for an everyday fragrance at a fraction of the cost.</li>
            <li> I think mine is a fake, or old...</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve bought few kinds of usher and</li>
            <li> My husband is using it everyday.</li>
            <li> So if you are black it is a must have item, and I guarantee you women will want to eat you and be all over you!</li>
            <li> I found it to be not just unpleasant, but almost urine-like cadence to the scent (straight from the bottle, not after it&#x27;s been applied.</li>
            <li> It loses its smell after less than an hour.  </li>
            <li> recommend this cologne for a business scene with no more than 2-3 sprays every 24 hours,</li>
            <li> Not sure.</li>
            <li> and they usually dont carry the 3.0 oz size.</li>
            <li> I have a hard time keeping my hands off my husband when he puts this on.</li>
            <li> Bang for your buck is hard to beat with this one.</li>
            <li> At the stores you have to pay at least 50</li>
            <li> Alrighty then, so if your anything like me, you can tell which reviews are fake, who&#x27;s trying to lead you elsewhere to buy their product, which companies are paying people to and/or are posing as other people to puff up the product.</li>
            <li> also purchased 3 other expensive colognes from Amazon and will be posted pictures and reviews of them today.</li>
            <li> This is fake product, not real usher perfume, smell is really weak</li>
            <li> Its subtle but manly.</li>
            <li> is that it may be a little too faint, as I am now buying another 3.4 oz.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s not surprising.</li>
            <li> but I personally think it&#x27;s irritating since it leaves a bad taste in my mouth even though I didn&#x27;t spray it in my mouth</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a decent smelling cologne for the price but the longevity on this is awful in my opinion.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, you can&#x27;t go wrong with this fragrance either as a gift or for yourself.</li>
            <li> Anymore expensive</li>
            <li> then the smell&#x27;s just about all gone, unfortunately.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s the way it suppose to be or if this is a fake product from the company.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just a weird fragrance.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical to buy cologne online</li>
            <li> A TOTAL FAKE!!!!!!</li>
            <li> or just to go casual.</li>
            <li> Seems crazy to me</li>
            <li> I buy it to see if it is good,not bad</li>
            <li> Samantha had to go though, bad breath had no place in my colony.</li>
            <li> Shocked, I used it for my advantage and built a woman colony where all of my needs are met.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> and I wasn&#x27;t disappointed.     </li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was kinda disappointed.  </li>
            <li> It leaks:(.</li>
            <li> The base notes were basically nonexistent for me.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed with this cologne.</li>
            <li> out his cologne is as awful as his music.</li>
            <li> horrible 6 sprays , nothing musky</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Purchased for my boyfriend. he loves it .... smells great...</li>
            <li> Excellent smelling cologne!</li>
            <li> Is it possible to give this ZERO stars? I accept responsibility for ordering this without having first smelled the scent in a local department store. I only considered his brand, status and appearance as indication that the scent would have a &amp;#34;sexy&amp;#34;, light scent (along with the product description). I found it to be not just unpleasant, but almost urine-like cadence to the scent (straight from the bottle, not after it&#x27;s been applied.</li>
            <li> Very good smelling for the pirce.....</li>
            <li> Smells wonderful my girl loves it definitely buying more as soon as possible I recommend this product if you want to keep you woman happy lol</li>
            <li> I got the product at home pretty quick and the price was very good. I&#x27;m very satisfied with product and service.</li>
            <li> I bought my husband the usher cologne for valentines day last year. I am now buying his second bottle as he is already out of the first. That says a lot considering he has about 50 bottles of cologne.I love the scent.  He always has people asking what fragrance he is wearing. Its not overbearing but doesn&#x27;t wear off easily either. Amazon offers it at a great price. I just ordered the 3.4 oz bottle at the same price as the 1.7 oz bottle I purchased from a retail store last year. I&#x27;m pretty stoked about that. I love Amazon!</li>
            <li> Wonderful Spray Cologne. You will like it. Smells Like a Man.</li>
            <li> I ordered this from Amazon as their price was much less expensive than the store where I had first tested it.    My husband has worn the same type of cologne for years and he was hesitant to try something new but after wearing it a couple of times he started getting lots of compliments at work.      It really has a nice masculine but not too woodsy smell.</li>
            <li> It was so nice and the order came within 3 days it was a good buy</li>
            <li> Came vary fast and smells great. One of my favorite cologne out there highly recommend this product to everyone. The price is great also and biggest size u can get</li>
            <li> Smells awesome! Quick delivery!</li>
            <li> I got exactly what I expected. This seller is very reliable</li>
            <li> ok, this is the original great smelling stuff this will be my second bottle.  this is the bomb  the usher black, this one smells the best of all the ushers, by far.  you need this and dolce and gabana</li>
            <li> great price, fast shipping</li>
            <li> Was a gift n he loved it - so did I lol</li>
            <li> Great product!  Second time i ordered for my son. He likes it and wanted it for his birthday.  He&#x27;s very choosy about what he wears</li>
            <li> Bought this for my 19 yr old grandson for Christmas and he loves it.  Says his girlfriend will love it too.  I, of course, opened the box to check it out myself when it was delivered (which was fast) and I liked it very much too.  Very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> A nice and pleasant smell. This is one of my favorite colognes.  It smells just like the cologne purchased from Macys and other stores.  It goes well with my SMILF &amp;#34;body scent&amp;#34;.  The ladies love it!!!</li>
            <li> Love it for size and price and the smell ohhhhh so perfect shipped fast!</li>
            <li> Love it! Ordered as a gift.  My grandson will be excited about this product. Good quality and received timely. Would order again.</li>
            <li> I ordered the 3.7 oz on friday and right now it is Wednesday. it just arrive, i got it for my dad for fathers day and he tried it on and he loved it...would prefer this!</li>
            <li> Smells good everything is good. But it does not last as long as I thought it would for the price.</li>
            <li> Smells great.Great price. I will use this merchant again.</li>
            <li> First off, a lot of reviews on here complain that they received \\&quot;Knock-Off\\&quot; colognes! Here&#x27;s where to get an actual legit bottle of my Fav cologne!...    I go through no other Cologne/Perfume seller other then \\&quot;FragranceNet\\&quot;.  I have been purchasing cologne from them for the last year, and each bottle I received is beautiful wrapped, have been compared to department store bottles,Boxes, and the smell, and they ARE 100% legit!!! I usually go through there there Online site, but recently seen they sell through Amazon too! AWESOME!!!     I received this cologne today, I have had it on my arm for around 3 hours already and the fragrance is almost as strong as when I first sprayed it on.  I stopped by my parents house and had my Pops and sister smell Usher and they both cannot stop complimenting it. Mainly my dad, I honestly never seen him go on &amp; on about a cologne like he has about Usher! I highly recommend this cologne, it&#x27;s AMAZING!!!    BTW, I&#x27;m a 30 yr old male, I feel this cologne can be for males 18 yrs and up. It has a wonderful soft Business smell, and can also be used for clubbing. Very universal.  Highly Recommend! :)  Paul</li>
            <li> There is just two  fragrances I wear and this was a surprise when I first smelled it at the store so I went to amazon so I could save money.</li>
            <li> Alrighty then, so if your anything like me, you can tell which reviews are fake, who&#x27;s trying to lead you elsewhere to buy their product, which companies are paying people to and/or are posing as other people to puff up the product. It realy sucks though, because you can never tell which is worth buying or not, hopefully someone who runs these sites&#x27;ll read this and get the hint. But that&#x27;s beside the point, this really is an awesome product, it has a unique smell, very punchy, in your face, suave, awesome. My already \\&quot;sexy and I know it\\&quot; attitude gets an ego boost (I appologize to all my family, friends, co-workers, and girlfriend as I make this purchase).</li>
            <li> Makes for a great gift</li>
            <li> Brought for my grandson for Christmas &amp; he is in love :)</li>
            <li> I bought this on a whim last Christmas for my fifteen year old son who loves to smell nice, and I was getting tired of all of the expensive and overpowering soaps he was asking me to buy. He loves this. At first, he was not super thrilled about it being a signature cologne from a pop star, but it was love at first whiff. Usher is a very forgiving scent, as it doesn&#x27;t become offensive unless the wearer applies way too much. It has a very clean smell without being too crisp, or waking you up every time the wearer walks by. And for the current selling price, you really can&#x27;t beat a cologne that doesn&#x27;t smell as cheap as it&#x27;s price tag. Overall, I am extremely pleased with this purchase for it&#x27;s intended purpose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only drawback I can think of is that it may be a little too faint, as I am now buying another 3.4 oz. after only 6 months. But, then again, my fifteen year old might be spraying some on multiple times a day and twice before bed . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, you can&#x27;t go wrong with this fragrance either as a gift or for yourself.</li>
            <li> I love how this smells! I love to snuggle my fiancé  and smell him! It never gets old and isn&#x27;t over powering.</li>
            <li> I tried this in a store and I loved it. best of all so did my wife. I saved about 50.00 by getting it from amazon .&lt;br /&gt;One stop shopping</li>
            <li> Great product great price</li>
            <li> Perfect scent for day or night.</li>
            <li> I bought this cologne for my boyfriend as a present. I love the way it smells and so does he. The aroma of the cologne when sprayed lasts a long time. You only need one or two sprays at the most. Also, there is a lot of cologne in the bottle itself. Overall, it will last a very long time. It was definitely a great buy.</li>
            <li> Awesome scent my girlfriend loves it so I use it rarely along with my other Colognes cheaper then Wal-Mart price this bottle should last me for years</li>
            <li> One of my favorite colognes. Very affordable as well.</li>
            <li> I bought this for a Christmas gift after pricing it in the stores.  I paid half the price and very pleased with the fragrance.</li>
            <li> I bought this years ago @ Dillards &amp; recently I ran out so I needed to find a new bottle to get my fix on (again ;)!  I ordered it, received it, &amp; got EXACTLY what I expected:  EXCELLENCE!  So folks, if you&#x27;ve smelled this stuff b4 &amp; need to get some more because u ran out, buy here w/ confidence!  :)</li>
            <li> I think this was on the shelf too long.</li>
            <li> I love love love the smell of this cologne.</li>
            <li> I had to find a quality fragrance for my teenager, as he is very generous when using it!  Usher is just the ticket.  Non offensive, it actually smells great, at a low price.</li>
            <li> Awesome product. They sell it for $40 plus tax at a normal store but got it cheaper here. Smells good, comes in a nice box. Came in fast, probably within 2 weeks. Will definitely buy this product for a friend :)</li>
            <li> I bought this fragrance for my dad and everyone in the family has been complimenting his scent. i think I&#x27;ll buy 1 for my brother also, it may not last long enough for some however. good buy, good price</li>
            <li> This came in a large box full of packaging peanuts which I promptly spilled all over the living room. It was worth it tho. This fragrance is simply divine. Musky but light. Lasts a long time. Very versatile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Usher beats nautica and axe hands down!</li>
            <li> I was a little worried about purchasing a fragrance online, however,  I was not disappointed with this product! Great price for a great product!</li>
            <li> My boyfriend has been using this cologne before and ever since we met. It smells so good and it isn&#x27;t overpowering like most men&#x27;s fragrances.</li>
            <li> She said she liked the scent so I began to use it.  I like it as well.  It has more of a youthful feel than some of the classic men&#x27;s fragrances. Like Old Spice.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend was complaining big time about my colognes. I went through a few of them . Surprise!! I finally got compliments on Usher. I was not so surprised that my 20 yr. old daughter also liked it. Even her boyfriend dug it.</li>
            <li> I like usher a lot, i have used this for a long time but i have my doubt about this perfume from amazon If it is original because It loses its smell after less than an hour, this is the reason to give one star, sounds like a fake product</li>
            <li> I purchased this product and was ripped off.  This is not the Usher cologne.  It was my first time purchasing a fragrance.  It is a knock off.  It loses its smell after less than an hour.  I wish I could leave no stars.  It is the money, but the principle.  I do not know why Amazon would give out a product or let a product sold that is not genuine.</li>
            <li> This was packaged just like the original, has to be the real thing. Smells awesome. Husband loves it, me too</li>
            <li> this is a very nice perfume.... I bought it as a surprise  for my boyfriend&#x27;s birthday... He liked it and I loved it. And the price and service were excellent. Will save the seller for the future.</li>
            <li> I like the fragrance, I just wish it lasted longer.</li>
            <li> I like the scent and the smell lasts the entire day. Just make sure it&#x27;s fulfilled by Amazon and you won&#x27;t have to worry about getting a knock off.</li>
            <li> Bought this for a gift for my brother. He loved the scent:)</li>
            <li> I bought two of these bottles....one for each of my sons, age 25 and age 27.  They love it.  Usher smells so manly.  The price on Amazon was 1/2 the cost of our local high end department store.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with this product! I&#x27;m a 21 year old college student and have gotten a lot of compliments from the girl friend, as well as other people. The only drawback is that I think the smell is just a little weak. I have to put on two or three sprays to really get a good amount. Other than that it&#x27;s all good....</li>
            <li> This item was given as a gift because the recipient has previously bought it and was running low.  Very woodsy yet light.</li>
            <li> The real thing. I was going to buy this cologne at Target and it was $20.00 for a 1 oz bottle. So i ordered this one. It&#x27;s the real thing, they had a sampler bottle that I tried out. And yup! Same scent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a Creed man but was in the market for an everyday fragrance at a fraction of the cost. This absolute fit the bill. I&#x27;m extremely impressed with this find! I will wear for years to come.</li>
            <li> Great product, delivered on time.  Thank you!!</li>
            <li> Love this cologne- smells great - smells professional, but also just right for a night out on the town. or just to go casual.</li>
            <li> Great price. Actual cologne, not a &amp;#34;China scent.&amp;#34; Much much cheaper than any department store.</li>
            <li> I purchased this last year a friend and he liked it, so I got this one now for a gift and it was in original box wrapped in the shear plastic as well.  I think it is authentic.  Thanks for the great customer service.</li>
            <li> The short and sweet of it. No, this is not in anyway the finest stuff around.. but it is still a great find for the price. Usher has done job of combining masculine, but not overbearing, light, fruit, musk all in one. My guy and i both love it. I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> It is a great product.. Fragrance lasts for a long time. I wish they also had 6.8 oz bottles.</li>
            <li> Great product, fast shipping....works well, so far so good, still too new to know for sure!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: product worked really well, no major complaints!</li>
            <li> I usually buy this at a local store for around $20 for the 1 oz bottle. So glad I found this one. Its a huge bottle of 3+ ounces and is the same cost of what Ive been buying.</li>
            <li> Incredible smell for the price, great longevity. I would and will continue to buy this product for the rest of my life.</li>
            <li> Spicy and romantic! I always get compliments from women when I wear this cologne out. You won&#x27;t be disappointed. Also comes at a great price, can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
            <li> This is one of my boyfriends favorite smells, and I love it just as much! It came exactly as I had hoped, and is completely authentic! Yayyy for good prices on quality items!</li>
            <li> I love the smell. This is everything I ever wanted in a fragrance. Don&#x27;t think there is anything else out there to smell any better</li>
            <li> I purchased this product based on the reviews I read here and I wasn&#x27;t disappointed.     I really like the fragrance and as others have noted the scent lasts all day. I had to get used to holding the bottle further away than I usually do to apply cologne because the fragrance is so strong and the spray mist is wide.    I&#x27;m also pleased by the design of the bottle. The texture is matte, which feels nice in the hand. Also spray cap is very decorative and quite weighty.</li>
            <li> Usher cologne is fantastic. I think it smells great and I would buy this for my friends as well, but I will pass on his cds for now.</li>
            <li> This was definitely worth rating 5 stars.  If there were more stars I would give you that too. Thank you for the great colony.</li>
            <li> Wonderful aroma after it has been on awhile.  It is not overpowering unless you have oversprayed.  I love it on my guy.</li>
            <li> Smell great and my wife loves when I put it on! i walk in the rooms and all you see is heads turning! Buy this and women will love it!</li>
            <li> It has a nice smell and is not too strong for a man. This last all day when you put it on. Great product.</li>
            <li> Love This fragrance and so do the ladies. I highly recommend this product. It came in a timely manner and was just as advertised.</li>
            <li> This cologne smells so good, you will be very happy that you bought it for your man. I would only ask that if we cannot have Usher when we purchase this item, can we have a signed wallet size picture?</li>
            <li> My husbands Favorite!</li>
            <li> had my speculations at first come one usher cologne but it actually smells good and i get complimented on it a lot.. product came on time as scheduled sealed unopened brand new.. i love it</li>
            <li> I bought this item for my boyfriend and he can&#x27;t seem to tell me enough times how much he loves it.</li>
            <li> got this as a gift and it was great smells good and lasts long i would highly recommend this if not another version of this</li>
            <li> very good price it was a way bigger bottle then what we expected i will definantly be buying another in the future! also had prompt shipping.</li>
            <li> The product was received quickly, in good condition. My husband loves this cologne and I was so pleased at the value. So good to be able to buy what you want and save money at the same time.</li>
            <li> My son seems to like this stuff, so we have bought it for a stocking stuffer. It was sold out locally, so I bought it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Smells good and can&#x27;t beat the price. Works well for a work cologne that I don&#x27;t want to waste my favorite cologne on.</li>
            <li> besides his many hits, it appears that Usher is good with smell too! This is the perfect summer/fall scent with lots of bright citrus notes, yet a touch of spice to keep it smelling manly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of my favorite colognes!</li>
            <li> Awesome, love the smell!  love the black bottle but,  you don&#x27;t know when you&#x27;re running out.</li>
            <li> My son wears this cologne, so I bought it for his birthday. Great value for a great product! Prices are much higher in department stores.</li>
            <li> good price and adorable smell , got a lot of positive feedback</li>
            <li> My husband has used Usher for maybe 5 yrs... I liked it on his Son and got it for him.... He smells soooo sexy !!!</li>
            <li> I buy it to see if it is good,not bad but not good enough,not very strong it weak smell very good</li>
            <li> Just what I wanted.  I usually find this product in the smaller bottles and was a little concerned about the larger quantity.  It has been great...no issues at all.</li>
            <li> Stop reading this and purchase! You won&#x27;t be disappointed. It lasts all day. 2 squirts and you&#x27;re golden. I&#x27;m very happy.</li>
            <li> Got this for boyfriend. He loved it</li>
            <li> Great price what else can I said,.I will smell good</li>
            <li> Usher is a great RNB artist , and makes great Colognes. Smells great, get so many compliments , and lasts all day. $19 for a $65 Cologne? now that is a steal</li>
            <li> I love this spray because I get compliments all the time for the good smell;;i want more;;will order again;;see you soon</li>
            <li> For me, this particular Usher for Men product did not provide the strength and longevity of  flagrance that I expected to receive.  On the positive side it does have a clean and sweet scent it simply does not last much beyond the initial spray.</li>
            <li> I like it,It took a little time to get the order but it&#x27;s worth it nice bottle and it smells good!</li>
            <li> I love the way it smells. My wife chose it for me and I always get compliments on it wherever I go.</li>
            <li> I am 46 years old and started wearing this at the suggestion of my teenage girls. I have always used Halstons. I have never had a single person not like it. It has no age limit. Seems crazy to me anyone would suggest that it is for younger men, or just for the older ones. At $25 for 3.4 ounce its a great deal. I have spent $30 on half the size off the shelf. Not a real complaint, but I do get &amp;#34;sniffed&amp;#34; a lot as others enjoy the cologne. Funny yes. But it shows how much people like it.</li>
            <li> lots of usher for a low price</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really surprise me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought this will last for long, I think they just added water. Up until now, I don&#x27;t use it that much because the smell doesn&#x27;t stick that long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend going to a retail store to personally buy it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is really good though, i like it. I wish it lasted longer.</li>
            <li> It is a nice scent to have to mix up the rotation.  It is something that is unique.  I have not met anyone else who has it, but it could become your signature scent.</li>
            <li> I was very happy to find a big bottle of my husbands favorite fragrance at the same price for the small bottle that only lasts a few weeks.  We will be reordering once this bottle gets low</li>
            <li> Good deal for a good cologne.  I bought it for my dad and he is enjoying it.  I would recommend it to a friend.</li>
            <li> great company to do business with. great product , great price I can not believe what a great value I had received, I had purchased two of them , one for me and one for a gift what a great deal</li>
            <li> I think mine is a fake, or old...that&#x27;s if cologne can get old lol.  I bought my 1st bottle from Macy&#x27;s and the fragrance was awesome.  I ordered this bottle because the price is much cheaper.  The fragrance smells similar, but changes soon after.  It isn&#x27;t nearly as strong as the original and doesn&#x27;t last long at all.  I&#x27;ve been bamboozled!!!</li>
            <li> This colonge smells absolutely amazing, I would definitley would buy this colonge again. Big bottle for the price of the item.</li>
            <li> My husband smells so good when he wears this cologne - I just cant get enough of him - wow</li>
            <li> The scent doesn&#x27;t seem to last as long as those I&#x27;ve bought in the store as if it&#x27;s watered down or just weak</li>
            <li> The smell is amazing, its simple and its necessary. In my teens keeping clean wasn&#x27;t a priority and smelly clean too. I was an avid user of axe body spray, but as I grew into my early 20&#x27;s meant I had to reach for a cologne that provide a scent that lasted long, with out me spraying every 3-4 hours. Also I wasn&#x27;t looking for a 60-100 dollar cologne as I am a college student try living in the demanding world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this cologne for a business scene with no more than 2-3 sprays every 24 hours,</li>
            <li> Go compliments first few days I started using it. It is a decent cologne but fades fast, it has a nice bottle cap. It is something you should wear casually and on less important days.</li>
            <li> Smell like a man for once.  This is some real fragrance that is musty and masculine for the ladies to enjoy, it isn&#x27;t any little boy axe or ed hardy scent, it&#x27;s a real sexy guy scent, that gets girls asking \\&quot;who smells good?\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I thought I would give this cologne a try as I was looking for a good priced daily cologne.  This has a great scent!  I am pretty impressed with it and will be buying more!  The quality of the bottle is also really well done.  This is a home run!</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with buy. Very impressed. Shipping time was right on. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Smells great great price</li>
            <li> Got this for my husband. Smells amazing. I am not lying ladies this is such a sexy smell. I was pleasantly surprised! He loves the smell and has even gotten compliments at work!</li>
            <li> The reason i bought it because i tried it on  at the store and the smell lasted the whole day and smelt great,i love it,&lt;br /&gt;but from Amazon the same cologne when i spray it 3-4 times,only lasts 5 minutes or less,even the smell is great&lt;br /&gt;i don&#x27;t know why this happens and i can&#x27;t change anything about it,but love the smell........</li>
            <li> Refreshing, classy smell. Perfect for a night out.</li>
            <li> This was a gift  IT was a big hit with a very dear friend who is like my dad.&lt;br /&gt;It arrived on time, smells really good,too. Made his day. Thanks so&lt;br /&gt;Much.</li>
            <li> Gave it to my father as a Christmas gift, it smells GREAT!!!</li>
            <li> great price both i and my boyfriend love it and he always wars it wish it came with more :)</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this item to anyone. It works just as you would expect it would. No complaints or regrets</li>
            <li> My boyfriend loves this and I can only find the .5 and 1.0 oz in most stores for a crazy price. Shipping was pretty fast as well and and the bottle and packaging was in great conditioning. Definitely will continue to by this product for my boyfriend when he runs out!</li>
            <li> i purchased it for a friend of mine for Christmas and he loved it.  He loved the smell and said he got a lot of compliments for it.</li>
            <li> Everyone seems to like it but I personally think it&#x27;s irritating since it leaves a bad taste in my mouth even though I didn&#x27;t spray it in my mouth I only spray my crotch, neck, and chest. Also I think it kind of stinks.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this item. I love cologne and this was a great buy! This is a great fragrance as well.</li>
            <li> This cologne has one of those &amp;#34;manly&amp;#34; smells, well according to my girlfriend. She is the only that brought a sample of these and I immediately fell in love with it, this is my main cologne for going out and going to work. Its not over bearing, the scent last a couple of hours and its extremly affordable.</li>
            <li> SMELL GOOD.. DON&#x27;T KNOW IF I&#x27;LL BUY ANOTHER ONE BUT ITS GOOD,</li>
            <li> Sounds soo great. Lasts me all day long! No complains at all. Buy right now. Great price that you can&#x27;t beat.</li>
            <li> Keeping it simple:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smell: Good but very strong at first.&lt;br /&gt;Price: Fantastic, though people need to realize this is an Eau De Toilette and not a cologne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not Great: The smell doesn&#x27;t last overly long. Maybe two hours and then it&#x27;s pretty hard to detect. Why? It&#x27;s not cologne, which is longer lasting. It&#x27;s an Eau De Toilette which is closer to aftershave in duration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: Would happily order again because the price is perfect for what you get. Anymore expensive and it&#x27;d be time to move on. Oh, and my wife approves of the smell.</li>
            <li> Only buy this cologne if you want a watered down version of the real stuff. It took a week for us to get this (on a 2 day prime order) and the scent, or lack thereof, just added insult to the injury. My husband sprayed it on himself 5 times and I was barely able to smell anything, and that was with my nose stuck up to his neck. They obviously water this cologne down then sell it at a discount price. If you buy this, you are getting RIPPED OFF. Go to a store in your local mall and buy a real one, unless you want the watered down version. Shame on you, Amazon, for selling this junk. I&#x27;m losing trust in you and I&#x27;ve always been a good customer. Maybe it&#x27;s better to pay a little more and get legitimate, REAL products! This is getting returned so fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One more important thing to note: Amazon will NOT let you return cologne or perfume anymore. So if you buy this and yours is also watered down like mine was, you&#x27;re stuck with it. No money back, no refunds, no returns. You&#x27;re just screwed. In my opinion, that&#x27;s their way of just scamming people even more. Buy at own risk!!</li>
            <li> Literally, the very best cologne I&#x27;ve ever had.    The 3.4 ounce bottle is HUGE. It even came with a free mirror (I don&#x27;t know why they&#x27;d give you a pink mirror with a guy&#x27;s cologne.. but hey, free stuff!) and a couple samples of other colognes.     Shipped promptly. Great seller, great product!</li>
            <li> I was not too sure what to expect; I had to trust the positive reviews that were posted by folks who had used it, and I am glad I did. Though it does not stay on for more than a day from my experience, it has a nice smell and is not expensive. I also had strangers asking what cologne I was wearing. That felt good too.</li>
            <li> This one is just like one of the colognes I had never used and I bought it to give it a try and im glad I did, I like it alot.i recommend it, shipping is very fast.</li>
            <li> smells really good and cheap good buy</li>
            <li> I love it so much , I bought it for my husband cause he asked me to and I fall in love with the smell</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS PRODUCT I WILL PURCHASE ANOTHER AGAIN IT LIVE UP TO EXPECTATION....LOTS OF FEMALES TO ME THEY LIKE THE SMELL</li>
            <li> smells good for its price</li>
            <li> Good smelling cologne for casual or formal wear.&lt;br /&gt;Price is probably the best part. In the mall or store it usually cost double, especially for the amount you get. Target sells the 1oz for 18.99$, for 4$ more you can get 2.4oz more.&lt;br /&gt;Overall very pleased.</li>
            <li> I purchased this scent for my husband last Christmas and spent over $65.00 on a smaller amount.  This is twice the product and a very very good price.  I purchased 3, one for each of my two sons for this Christmas and yet another for my husband.  Shipment was very quck also.  Thank you</li>
            <li> Great value! My husband loves this fragrance. Before this I bought the tiny bottles at Walmart that would last like a minute!</li>
            <li> Bought this for my son and of course he loves it so that makes it a buyer plus to me. Thanks for having a great buy.</li>
            <li> I like it. will buy again</li>
            <li> Very sastified,good product and promt service,thank you guys.</li>
            <li> An old friend told me about this product, so I got it for my boyfriend &amp; he loved it ! Definitely worth the money !!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always loved this cologne. Its subtle yet smells great. I always get compliments from people at work about how it smells, even from one of the most feared, leathery old managers that we have. I would definitely recommend this.</li>
            <li> Smells very nice and last throughout the night. Worth the money and a lot cheaper here then anywhere else. j</li>
            <li> This stuff smells great and I bought it for someone who likes it but was going to buy it at a department store that was more expensive.  I love Amazon.com as I hate to shop and although I wanted to buy a smaller bottle, this was a great deal for a great price!</li>
            <li> Bought this strictly off of user reviews without smelling. Isn&#x27;t horrible just a bit cheap smelling and kind of overpowering. Definitely a musky smell. Everybody&#x27;s nose if different though. I won&#x27;t be buying again.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my boyfriend. he is in the marine corps, and took it with him for training in another state because he loved it so much! for those that dont know, they have super limited space lol&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;plus, this company was awesome and got it to me in time for the holidays!</li>
            <li> Smells amazing. Is awesome for the price, the bottle is true to size. Packing was great. Um why go to a department store when you have amazon.</li>
            <li> Was a gift and he always uses it - it is his favorite cologne It has a great fragrance not too strong just nice.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my dad. He loved and ask me how much I payed because smell very good. ;-)</li>
            <li> Well packaged. No extra for the standard delivery and it arrived in time for Christmas.   I picked the sender and product from the history of reviews.   My son LOVES this product... I will buy again from AMAZON.COM... it is my starting point for Internet purchases.</li>
            <li> It smells so good and was for sale at an awesome price. My loves how it smells.  I really recommend it!!!</li>
            <li> every woman loves to smell and inhale usher!</li>
            <li> My Man Usher, wife told me it smells like the convicts in the male prison where she is a nurse lol. Take that  for what its worth. Personally I liked the fragrance.</li>
            <li> My favorite cologne (or in Internet speak, colon lol) for my husband to wear.</li>
            <li> Usher et al. hit it out of the ball with this one! You cannot beat this product given its price point and powerfully sexy and enduring scent. A must buy.</li>
            <li> One of the highest reviewed colognes so that&#x27;s why I bought it, but once I got it I was kinda disappointed.  Fragrance isn&#x27;t that strong I thought my nose was stopped up cause I couldn&#x27;t really smell it but I soon realized it was just the cologne.  It&#x27;s okay but I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> It was exactly as stated. I&#x27;ve bought this cologne about 4 times now. Cheap and nice smelling cologne just can&#x27;t go wrong here.</li>
            <li> My hubby loves this cologne smells wonderful might have to purchase another bottle</li>
            <li> I am a cologne collector and this smells great and the price it fantastic.</li>
            <li> I bought a small sample of this at WalMart to check it out since it was the only mens cologne that was always almost sold out.  After I put some on it blended well with my body chemistry and had the best scent compared to my more expensive colognes, Calvin Klein, Armani etc.  While my country star colognes do well also, this one is a secret weapon among my stash of great smells.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I ordered a larger bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, I am impressed with the scent, chicks dig it and I enjoy that action.  While I don&#x27;t feel like a superstar R&amp;B artist or sing like one, or as a matter of fact look like one, it does have its benefits when you&#x27;re out and attracting attention.  So, five stars from me.  Can&#x27;t complain.</li>
            <li> This Usher By Usher for Men Toilette Spray was purchased for my son.  It is his favorite fragrance, so he wears it often.  I&#x27;ve purchased other bottles of this fragrance for him in the past.</li>
            <li> This cologne is great if you want to smell good on a budget but if you can save a little and buy quality cologne from a department store</li>
            <li> The ladies will love this for her man!</li>
            <li> Smells good but I dunno if it&#x27;s a knock of or not. They say such low prices means it must be a knock of, but I just dunno. I hope it&#x27;s not coz I paid good money fer this.</li>
            <li> this cologne honestly smells like cigarettes and mouthwash.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed with this cologne. I will never buy from amazon again!</li>
            <li> Smells great.. i own a ton of cologne, as this one it great..</li>
            <li> Both my boys love this cologne. The smell stays with them forever when they put it on. It was a great price and I will be bak to get more when this runs out!</li>
            <li> great smelling  cologne</li>
            <li> Diluted or old product.  I have used Usher in the past and is my favorite cologne.  This purchase from Amazon seems to be old stock.  Does not have same smell and does not last long in comparison to one bought from Macy&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Smells good and masculine, sweet but not overly so.  I bought it to use with the Usher bodywash and it seems to smell good on me.  I was using Perry Ellis Portfolio in the black bottle which matches well but smells a little more peppery than sweet and a stronger scent.  The spray is really nice.  Instead of just squirting a narrow spritz straight onto the skin the spray delivers a very fine mist which envolopes into a wide cloud and just hangs in midair for a second.  I like that because then I can spray the right amount all over without it being to strong or wasteful.</li>
            <li> Usher is a very, very good smelling cologne - to me, it smells pretty fruity... sort of like pineapple/bubblegum or like the gum Juicy Fruit. While that may freak you out, it manages to pack a pretty manly smelling punch in there at the same time, which is what makes this such a great fragrance. The big issue with this cologne is that it only seems to last about two hours tops - by then the smell&#x27;s just about all gone, unfortunately.  For the price it is though, it&#x27;s not surprising. If you&#x27;re looking to get a 15-30 year old guy a present, get this.. it&#x27;s a pretty safe buy.  I do not, however, think any guy that&#x27;s about 35 or older should wear this... it&#x27;s just a younger smelling cologne.</li>
            <li> This was an Xmas gift for my 16 year old son and he loves the  smell, I am thinking of getting one for me because it smells great plus the price is right,</li>
            <li> EVERYONE LOVES HOW I SMELL WITH THIS!!</li>
            <li> Man, that&#x27;s the best cologne I have tried recently! I truly can&#x27;t get enough of it. Very masculine! I consider myself a connoisseur of perfumes and I highly recommend this one. I am white with light brown hair and blue eyes and it feels good on me, but I think it will be much better for black guys or dark skin/hair people. So if you are black it is a must have item, and I guarantee you women will want to eat you and be all over you! It is a very good cologne on the heavy side (not too much though), but still fresh. I would pay $100 for this one and the price here is the best price by far to every other place I have seen it at!!!</li>
            <li> Got a lot of compliments. Everyone wanted to know what I was wearing.  It&#x27;s good to way a great smell that folks can&#x27;t recognize.</li>
            <li> I got what i paid for, in excellent conditions. This was a gift for my little brother and he loves it.</li>
            <li> Very excited that I only paid 15 bucks for a huge bottle of Usher! Hopefully it smells as good P- diddys!</li>
            <li> Love it. The fragrance more than met my expectations. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> Good Choise to this kind of product. I recommended it 100% . . . . . . . . .</li>
            <li> Not bad. Thought it would be a better smell though. Oh well can&#x27;t complain ha!</li>
            <li> Amazing ... was the real deal ! ... would recommend to anyone. .. dont waste your time with walmart when u get more bang for your buck jack !!</li>
            <li> Excelente producto, lo recomiendo!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband for Valentines day.  We both like it. It has a soft nice smell.  Some cologne bothers my nose</li>
            <li> A lot of these artist are coming out with there own fragrances... And I think Usher got a good one over here...I would most likely buy it again...</li>
            <li> SMELLS SO GOOD ON MY BOYFRIEND...EVERYTIME I SMELL IT ON HIM MAKES ME WANNA HAVE SEX WITH HIM ALLDAY LOL...VERY GREAT COLOGNE</li>
            <li> It was pretty quick delivery. I chose this to give it to my boyfriend (30 years old). He said he&#x27;s been using this one for three year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I am not sure is the top decoration things is rotating. Is that originally like that? Not sure.</li>
            <li> I got this for my husband for him to have something different.  He loves it, and I love to smell it on him. It&#x27;s not too loud. It&#x27;s perfect for a guy who likes a soft and elegant smell</li>
            <li> My wife smelled this on a waiter one night on vacation and bought this for me the next day.  It&#x27;s a good cologne but it doesn&#x27;t last all day...most women seem to comment positively about it though.</li>
            <li> Bought as part of a gift for my son. One of my son&#x27;s favorite fragrances. It smells dawn good on him!</li>
            <li> Nice fragrance, price can&#x27;t beat too. I would definitely buy this again and may be gift to friends and family.</li>
            <li> i bought this perfume because i saw all the good reviews that every boudy gave this perfume but i didnt like it i gave this as achristmas present and was expecting that this perfume would smell really good but i didnt like it i do not recomend it</li>
            <li> It was a great price and a great buy. I recommend everyone by this fragrance for any man. It is a great buy</li>
            <li> Way better then store product, for reason that I would have paid 3 times more and they usually dont carry the 3.0 oz size. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> Love it love it love it :-)</li>
            <li> Smells great!! great service.</li>
            <li> Product is exactly what you see In the retail environment but cost less than half. I can not imagine ever buying this product  again and paying retail.  Love Amazon and love me some Usher cologne.</li>
            <li> I always get compliments in public on this cologne.  I&#x27;ve been stopped in the grocery store by women saying how nice I smell.</li>
            <li> I like it, and others seem to as well</li>
            <li> Usher has always been one of my favorite men&#x27;s fragrances. But when you can find it at a price point lower than most other merchants offer this product for, you&#x27;ve hit a home run. Would recommend this item to others as a good buy.</li>
            <li> Nice smelling.. Good price.....</li>
            <li> I ordered two of the Usher colognes  as a Christmas present. When they arrived, it was in perfect condition. The estimated time was on point. It smells great for the best price. Every where else was just twice as much. My secret Santa loved it and told me his dad would come in his room just to put it on. Haha, it&#x27;s simply excellent. Excellent overall.</li>
            <li> My grandson is 15 years old.  He like girls.  He like this.  I knew nothing about it when I bought it as a surprise, but I he made a point of telling me he likes it.</li>
            <li> THIS IS MY FAVORITE SCENT FOR MY HUSBAND MMMMMM AND THE PRICE IS AWSOME WE LOVE IT AND IT CAME JUST IN TIME FOR VALENTINES AND WE LOVE IT I WOULD BUY FROM SELLER AGAIN !! WE ARE VERY HAPPY !!</li>
            <li> It smells hot!! Girls like me when I put it on!</li>
            <li> Too light for me and doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> My son loves this just as much as I love the fragrance for women!</li>
            <li> Has a large fragance.. My wife loves it too.. Good price for a great product.. I&#x27;ve imported to Paraguay.. Recommended..</li>
            <li> THIS ITEM IS VERY NICE I GIVE THIS ITEM TO MY HUSBAND AND HE LOVED IT!!!AND IT CAME RIGHT ON TIME.</li>
            <li> I tell I put this on let me tell you I didn&#x27;t have to do no work at all ladies love it this is a must have an its classic well done usher</li>
            <li> The packaging was great and when I opened it I was surprised by the size of the bottle. The scent itself is very good and I can smell it throughout the day.</li>
            <li> Bought it for my brother and he loves it.</li>
            <li> I got this for my husband and it smells so good and he loves it to! its the best i have smelt in a long time. would buy it again for sure!</li>
            <li> The scent was better than I expected. I got the cologne not knowing what it would smell like for my dad on Christmas and he loves it.</li>
            <li> I bought this and gave it to my husband for Christmas.  He seems to like and uses it all the time.</li>
            <li> I spent the extra time reading reviews from people regarding the scent and effectiveness of various colognes and made a hurried decision at the end to mark this one as a known choice from others I&#x27;ve never heard of. I wanted something other people don&#x27;t normally have and chose this one as a choice off the reviews here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cologne smells like something I&#x27;ve smelled on many people before, I was dissapointed. Last thing you want is smelling like someone else around you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smells decent but the cologne is burned by people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;lasts about an hour or two but stays on your clothes for a day or two with minimal scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;will never buy usher again.</li>
            <li> My brother loved his gift. Thanks Amazon!!</li>
            <li> This is fake product, not real usher perfume, smell is really weak and I&#x27;ve bought few kinds of usher and their all smell the same way don&#x27;t buy it</li>
            <li> Best cologne out there! Great price too!</li>
            <li> Love this smell on my man</li>
            <li> Best deal for the price  ! really big bottle</li>
            <li> Fragrance is nice but doesnt stay for long.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite colognes</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance because it smells good but mostly because it gets a lot of compliment. Its subtle but manly.</li>
            <li> Great sexy but not long lasting</li>
            <li> Item is as it was described, thanks.</li>
            <li> Thank you. It is a good perfume. And I got it so fast. No Daley. It is inexpensive.&lt;br /&gt; Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> It was a gift to my son for Father&#x27;s day. I saw it at Walgreens first but thought the price was a tad expensive, so I decided to go with the tried and proven Amazone. It worked! it came in time for Father&#x27;s Day and my son and his family loves the scent on him.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!&lt;br /&gt;Mary</li>
            <li> This product surely makes me a man of mystery!! Its Rockin&#x27; I hope the girls like it as much as I do!</li>
            <li> Wow, Usher really stepped his game up with this cologne.  I think this one is even better than P Diddy&#x27;s Unforgivable.  Don&#x27;t get me wrong, P. Diddy&#x27;s is great but I find myself wearing Usher&#x27;s cologne more daily.  A definite keeper for men&#x27;s cologne collection.</li>
            <li> Definitely smells great! The girls seem to tell me that I smell good alot. The guys even ask me what kinda cologne it is. Good stuff</li>
            <li> I think this is the cologne I have been waiting for!! Such wonderful smells!!&lt;br /&gt;this is the first time using this cologne and everyone around my seems to like it.&lt;br /&gt;i would buy this again , thanks</li>
            <li> I wear this when I go to visit my parents. We go to various restaurants, and I don&#x27;t want to smell up the car with a strong cologne. This fits the bill. I sometime use this at home when I am just puttering about. Not one of my favorites when I go to clubs, though. This bottle will probably last for years.</li>
            <li> I loved it was great and would recommend to all if interested...Was worth the money and the price was fair</li>
            <li> Has been my favorite cologne for a long time. I bought my boys a bottle just so I could have it around and smell it once in a while. When I got remarried, my husband loved the scent so now I keep him in supply of this yummy smelling cologne.</li>
            <li> i order this all the time great price and love how it smells i willl be ordering this again very soon since i try never to run out!!!</li>
            <li> Love this one even more, smell lost for a long time</li>
            <li> The product came on time. The smell to me ,  mimic Abercrombie &amp; Fitch-Fierce. But Usher smells goes away in less of 20 min. By the end of the day, it seems like you never had put any cologne at all. I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s the way it suppose to be or if this is a fake product from the company.</li>
            <li> Gift for Dad.  Smells Great, nice bottle!</li>
            <li> My husband loves this Eau De Toilette spray by Usher.  Nothing more to say than.....I love it on him too!!  Of course the smell is always different on different people.  But for my husband and I......great product and price too.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend loves this. He wanted it for a while and I found it so much cheaper than a store.</li>
            <li> Love this scent and couldn&#x27;t beat the price</li>
            <li> Thank you, great price.</li>
            <li> Yes I like the smell until I realized that it is not for younger ones. So planned to switch back to nautica</li>
            <li> Fiance loves it.  Once of his favorite colognes.</li>
            <li> this fragrance  smells so good,i am going to order more soon.i have heard about this cologne .im glad to have it now.:)</li>
            <li> Smells wonderful, and it came as if I just bought it from the store! I received it right on time. This is a big bottle only $25, definitely way worth it!</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve been using this perfume for a couple of years, still love the smell as much as my lady does...very menly, in a mysterious way.</li>
            <li> This stuff is way more expensive at the mall. Smells great, doesn&#x27;t smell like a knock off. I LOVE this smell and the price is unbeatable.</li>
            <li> I give this 5 stars for the delivery quickness and the pricing. At the stores you have to pay at least 50+ dollars for this usher cologne. Through this seller I obtained a great smelling cologne, everyone always asks me what I am wearing because it smells so great, and I got it for half the price then you would at the mall or any place like that. I love this cologne, my wife loves this cologne, my friends and co-workers always complement me on my cologne. I 100% recommend this for buyers looking for a new smell and to use this seller. They are excellent.</li>
            <li> Got this cologne for my bf since he was talking about it &amp; he loved it! Plus not to mention that it smells sooooooo good!! ❤️</li>
            <li> Good stuff,  really smooth and the ladies enjoy it. Never had a complaint,  only good words from people. Get it</li>
            <li> Usher for Men is like a chaparral of generic cologne. I only wore this twice before my sample busted in my travel bag, but I got something completely different from both usages. It&#x27;s just a weird fragrance. If someone were to ask me what a &#x27;cologne&#x27; or &#x27;perfume&#x27; &#x27;was&#x27;, I would just let them sample Usher for Men, because it just smells synthetically generic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First whiff, I smelled something fruity, combined with the generic cologne scent. But the fruit basically disappears after a few minutes and the top notes are hardly noticeable. On first wear the middle notes smelled exactly like Davidoff Adventure, which is a good thing, but I did not get this at all on my 2nd wearing. The base notes were basically nonexistent for me. I couldn&#x27;t smell anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Turns out his cologne is as awful as his music. Not even worth the 30$ for 100mL.</li>
            <li> good deal for the price. I don&#x27;t know what else to write about this.  It&#x27;s okay is all I have to say.he loves it.</li>
            <li> This is great stuff. I have a hard time keeping my hands off my husband when he puts this on. Way to go Usher, we love this one!!</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my husband. I went solely on the reviews because I&#x27;ve never smelled it before.  It smells really good, light, fresh, clean, but still masculine. My husband likes it a lot. The only problem is I think it fades to quickly. Lasts about as long as a body spray. I don&#x27;t think he minds that though. It was priced great for the size and shipped pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> Our teen son has outgrown Axe (thank God) and asked me to find him some kind of cologne.  I smelled about 20 seizure-inducing drug-store colognes and was ready to take my headache and go home when I saw a tester bottle of Usher on the shelf.  I  smelled it and right away I knew this was the one.  The store was sold out of Usher, but luckily Amazon had it in stock (with free SuperSaver shipping!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s got a clean, classy scent that doesn&#x27;t overpower, and even spraying it on in a cloud the way teen boys do, he smells nice.  It has woody undertones of sandlewood and cedar, and thankfully it smells nothing like Stetson, Aspen, Jovan Musk or Drakkar Noir.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The box and bottle are masculine and attractive, and of course Usher (the singer) is popular with teen boys.  The price is reasonable too.  If you&#x27;re looking for a nice cologne for the teen or man in your life, give this one a sniff.</li>
            <li> i love this smell so much on my bf i even bought it for my new boyfriend haha. he doesnt know my old boyfriend wore it and he will never know. Its so hot!</li>
            <li> Good buy, fast delivery.</li>
            <li> A generic drug store scent, not very long lasting. Even with a low price of $20, not worth the money.</li>
            <li> I love how this cologne smells and loves when my husband wears it!! Great price for size as well!! Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> Husband didn&#x27;t care for this fragrance</li>
            <li> love it  it awesome good job with this will buy again thank you once again enjoy your weekend and your day</li>
            <li> This cologne exceeded  my expectations! It was so good, I bought two. Not only was I excited about but the price was the best I had seen. I will be getting some more!</li>
            <li> Smells OKAY nothing really intoxicating as the young guys or mid early 20s would like to get arouse the girls. It&#x27;s more of like a good smelling aftershave but for the price it&#x27;s not bad. I would say it&#x27;s more suite for older men. My opinion.</li>
            <li> I came across this cologne while I was at the mall and I had to get a bottle of it. It&#x27;s has a great smell that is good for any occasion, I even wear it when I&#x27;m not going anywhere because it smells so good. I&#x27;ve gotten compliments from other people as well while wearing it. I would recommend this cologne to anyone that wants to smell great!</li>
            <li> As represented and delivered on time.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my fiancee and I fell in love with this scent. It&#x27;s so sexy.</li>
            <li> I have used this cologne before but have not seen it in stores in some time. This product was great.</li>
            <li> It leaks:(. Every time I spray it I get some on my hand. I was skeptical to buy cologne online and this is what I get. Lol.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my boyfriend for Christmas, and it smells amazing! He loves it, and I do too :)</li>
            <li> Great quality for the price. Chicks Love it! This is just my opinion and I&#x27;m writing this because in order to leave a review I must have a certain amount of words in my review. Really!!!  AYFKM. Jusy Saying.</li>
            <li> I gave this five stars because i love the way it smells and my son loves that fragrance a lot.</li>
            <li> Thats the words my girlfriend tells me every time I put this on, its great stuff! Comes at a great price, everything else is like 80$...&lt;br /&gt;Good stuff right here!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected and it arrived quickly. Smelss awesome on my BF and he gets compliments all the time</li>
            <li> This was a present for my son.  He loves the smell of this and it isn&#x27;t too strong.  He wears it all the time</li>
            <li> Bought for my son he loves it</li>
            <li> Great prize for good size bottle</li>
            <li> Nice smelling and great service.  1/2 the price I&#x27;ve paid for it in the past :)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a decent smelling cologne for the price but the longevity on this is awful in my opinion. It&#x27;s a generic smelling cologne though with not alot of character to it, Kinda like how febreze works.</li>
            <li> Smells great will buy more</li>
            <li> good one. came ahead of time</li>
            <li> I am 22 Years old Great smell... ladies love it.. trust me !!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> it has a great smell but it only last for like 1 hour</li>
            <li> this is a great price but i don&#x27;t really like the scent. it has a musty smell to it that i don&#x27;t care for. my son loves it though and since that was who it was for it doesn&#x27;t matter what i think. lol. quick delivery too</li>
            <li> thought would help me dance and sing like usher but that was kind of a let down but other then that smells great.</li>
            <li> People complain about it being a generic smell. I&#x27;d have to disagree and say it has a very smooth fresh scent that is masculine and has sex appeal. Bang for your buck is hard to beat with this one. Presentation is very nice, and overall smell is outstanding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now the reason I took it down on rating is the fact that this product has poor longevity and on the weaker side as far as strength.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, this is where creative use comes to play. I personally have a GF i&#x27;m around very often and close with. and at the end of the day when time comes to say goodbye or to pull her in. That cologne has just the right touch. Very intimate and sexy. Since its not overbearing the close factor becomes welcoming. Just use a few sprays in key locations like sides of the neck... She will melt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this review helped. I will be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> This was a gift to my husband, he really liked the fragrance as I did too. It is not to strong, to over power you. My husband is using it everyday.</li>
            <li> I love the way this smells, I&#x27;ve had women tell me I smell &amp;#34;So fine&amp;#34; so its a winner for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase on cyber Monday !  I got a great product for a wonderful price.  whoa</li>
            <li> Love it. Blend well with my body odour and gives me an executive status. Will always go for it</li>
            <li> Great product. Great price, Love the smell&lt;br /&gt;Shipped and received in a timely manner.&lt;br /&gt;No complains item as described. Great fragrance for men, Great gift or just to try something new</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite men&#x27;s fragrances. Bought it as a father&#x27;s day gift for my dad a couple years ago and he loved it enough to switch from another brand he had been using for years. He asked for it again this year!</li>
            <li> This was a birthday present for my husband. He absolutely loved it. The product was shipped in great shape &amp; came sooner then expected. We are very pleased with this product &amp; the packaging was pretty nice to.</li>
            <li> A TOTAL FAKE!!!!!! TRUST ME!</li>
            <li> Great product! I bought this for my husband because he ran out of the UR By Usher which also smells great he loves it and I do too.</li>
            <li> Great price for a great scent!  My husband loves this and so do I!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my dad for Father&#x27;s Day and he loves it! It smells fantastic and buying it on Amazon was definitely much cheaper than buying it in a department store.</li>
            <li> Attention will be at your feet, and intriguing conversation awaits you! So Brace yourself for impact! This is a panty dropper</li>
            <li> i got the colgne on time but it was more than half empty. i dont know if it was used or what but i didnt order a half empty spray.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite cologne by far! A couple of sprays lasts all day and it blends well with my chemistry.  No need to bathe in it.</li>
            <li> He loved it. I would definitely Buy more colognes from this company.</li>
            <li> This was a good price and received it in a good time I am well pleased and will buy again Thanks.</li>
            <li> Cologne seemed to not have fragrance after hour or so</li>
            <li> My son was very happy with his gift :)</li>
            <li> My husband liked it ok but told me not to buy him that fragrance anymore because it smelled like a weaker version of the one he previously sampled.I didn&#x27;t like the smell to much either.</li>
            <li> Smells so good on my husband. Price is outstanding compared to department stores. Totally satisfied. Will be buying more.</li>
            <li> The smell was fantastic, I bought two models from this brand, and I love both.</li>
            <li> Ok so as a girl I like spraying cologne on my pillow just because it&#x27;s nice to have a guyish smell around. So I decided to try the Usher scent just because I felt a strong desire to, and I was not disappointed. I instantly fell I love with it and I can&#x27;t get enough of it. Guys, trust me, if you are wearing this to impress a girl, she will melt in your arms! And girls, either but some of this for your guy or get some for yourself because honestly, this is a gift of pure epicness.</li>
            <li> Great Service and item</li>
            <li> I bought this for my dad and it smells so nice.</li>
            <li> horrible 6 sprays , nothing musky ; maybe old age I&#x27;m 49!</li>
            <li> This cologne is awesome i always get tons of complements from all my lady friends dont hesitate to buy this</li>
            <li> Great Smelling Cologne with the exception that it leaks from the seal and is unable to be returned.</li>
            <li> Between mild to strong, it&#x27;s ok for daily use.</li>
            <li> this cologne smells amazing, it was shipped fast, is good quality, sold at a fair price, great gift for any guy!</li>
            <li> I thought this product was great and the price was the selling point for me. I read a lot of reviews that said this was a possible knock-off, but I didn&#x27;t find any issues with this product or seller. The product was the same quality of product similar to the one I bought at the department store. I bought this for my husband who loved the original one I bought, but it was so expensive at the other place. I would recommend this and buy this again for my husband.</li>
            <li> Bought as a gift they love it</li>
            <li> Was a B Day gift for a great friend!!!!!!!! I got it myself too and i feel like recording in a booth singing my CONFESSIONS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Love this cologne ! Got it for my dad&#x27;s birthday an he loved it as well.</li>
            <li> I had to take some unboxing and product pictures and post them so everyone can see what I got.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent seems to be a nice balance of musk and fruit/fresh scents. I would say that I&#x27;ve smelled scents like this one before, but I don&#x27;t know anyone who wears this exact scent. Heck, I didn&#x27;t even know Usher made a cologne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as people talking about &amp;#34;fake&amp;#34; scents, I sprayed a paper towel once about an hour ago and I just waved it like a fan about 2 feet from my face and get a very strong scent so this seems like the real deal. The only thing that caught my attention was the top of the cap has scratches and the bottle is a little scuffed. The scratches are all in the same fashion so I assume this happened during the packing assembly line and the scuffs looks like from rubbing against the cardboard during shipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also purchased 3 other expensive colognes from Amazon and will be posted pictures and reviews of them today.</li>
            <li> What can I tell you? this is cologne and most women complement me that I smell great in it... I&#x27;m not some kind of ladies man or anything, and I&#x27;m not saying this will get you women... it won&#x27;t. But if you meet a woman she&#x27;ll notice the cologne and likely complement you on it.</li>
            <li> I have to say at first I was skeptical but once I tried it, I found it smelled like unicorn tears and the stuff babies and angels are made of. Women can&#x27;t help but notice the smell of magic and of birth and motherhood around me... Shocked, I used it for my advantage and built a woman colony where all of my needs are met. Samantha had to go though, bad breath had no place in my colony. I ordered another bottle of this sweet masculine unicorn aroma to ensure I can continue to build my utopia. Buy it people... Buy it!</li>
            <li> I had high expectations from this considering the reviews I saw on amazon but this turned out to be a dampner.This perfume does not even last an hour after applying it which pretty much beats the purpose of having it.</li>
