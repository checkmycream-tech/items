            <li>I love, love this mirror!</li>
            <li>The fact that it stands on its own for hands-free use and does adjust and tilt are a couple of its better qualities.  </li>

            <li>I have a more $$$ lighted mirror attached to bedroom wall for most of my make-up application</li>
            <li>Love the side that has magnification.</li>
            <li>Many hotels do not have magnifying mirrors in their vanity areas.</li>
            <li>I thought I was going to being in love with this mirror.  </li>
            <li>I love the mirror and the magnifying mirror on the reverse</li>
            <li>I opted for a plastic travel mirror instead which worked out a lot better.</li>
            <li>Just right price wise also.</li>
            <li>This is great for those of us who don&#x27;t see up close as we get older.  </li>
            <li>Great for us older gals.</li>
            <li>The close up is great for getting the stray hairs that you can&#x27;t spot in a normal mirror.</li>
            <li>I loved this mirror at first</li>
            <li>and once I borrowed it during a recent stay I was happy to buy my own.</li>
            <li>However, because the mirror is a large size (a good thing)</li>
            <li>This is a very cool looking mirror.  </li>
            <li>A very good alternative to larger or lighted mirrors that I did not have room for.</li>
            <li>Quality was very good ... especially for the price.</li>
            <li>/&gt;the magnification is great for these old eyes to pluck eyebrows, you can hold it in your hand...</li>
            <li>Build quality is good, real glass mirrors, not chintzy plastic.</li>
            <li>With this swivel mirror on my desk, I can easily see who&#x27;s coming.  </li>
            <li>It is great for traveling as well as moving to around to a different room if you need better lighting.</li>
            <li>This collapsible mirror is easy to use at home or when travelling.</li>
            <li>was easy to pack when I was moving, but I wouldn&#x27;t carry it with me when I&#x27;m going on vacations</li>
            <li>The magnification works well and can also be adjusted easily.  </li>
            <li>maybe 5 x as 10 x maybe to strong for men may be o.k for women putting on war paint..</li>
            <li>you  need a good, portable mirror, I highly recommend this one.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, the product is nicely made and exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>I really liked it for the first couple of trips.</li>
            <li>The mirror is just fine</li>
            <li>but it has worked just fine.  </li>
            <li>Works fine, if you have the the counter space, for a counter-top mirror.</li>
            <li>Fits in my make up bag just fine.</li>
            <li>It folds up nicely and is very compact and easy to pack.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s got a great brushed satin finish that matches my faucet and light fixtures</li>
            <li>This is a fabulous travel mirror.  </li>
            <li>It is not only versatile, but it is also really attractive.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy this mirror.</li>
            <li>but I enjoy the way it sits on my bathroom counter.</li>
            <li>The joints hold position very well, nice height.</li>
            <li>This mirror is great, especially for travel.  </li>
            <li>Great mirror, if only it would stay together.  </li>
            <li>It would be a great product if only it held together.  </li>
            <li>Perfect mirror for travel or everyday use.  </li>
            <li>Very well made mirror with a nice protective pouch.</li>
            <li>Reflection is crystal clear, it&#x27;s a good quality mirror with no distortion.</li>
            <li>It is just the right size to fit in my makeup bag!</li>
            <li>The magnification is just right to let me better see what I am doing.</li>
            <li>sometimes I see TOO MUCH!!!  </li>
            <li>Very nice for the low price.</li>
            <li>This is a great travel mirror and it collapses to a fairly flat package.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what my wife wanted - high magnification, good quality and value and easily portable.  </li>
            <li>so unless you have somebody willing to ride shotgun for you and show you the rough spots -- you&#x27;ll be perfectly preened in some areas and cat-like on others.</li>
            <li>They are well made and this one is sort of rich looking.  </li>
            <li>I broke my original Jerdon MC449N 5.5 inch Folding Two-Sided Swivel Travel Mirror with 10x Magnification.</li>
            <li>Worth the reasonable price for sure!</li>
            <li>It constantly falls over and I&#x27;ve tried tightening it on my own with a screw driver, I am pretty handy, but nothing worked.  </li>
            <li>It lets me apply my eye makeup with a lot of precision, and is overall good quality item.</li>
            <li>Overall - good purchase.</li>
            <li>Would be wise to loosen the joints before unfolding and then tighten just enough to allow it to stay positioned.</li>
            <li>packs well for travel &amp; has good magnification;  have traveled with it several times; it works well in a hotel room if there is a desk or counter to sit it.</li>
            <li>You can position it in so many angles and it&#x27;s also very sturdy.  </li>
            <li>Good especially for traveling</li>
            <li>......really not a bad mirror.....</li>
            <li>With the natural aging process, my eyesight was becoming less than perfect.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light weight but sturdy and has just the right magnification options.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great travel mirror but large enough to use at home.</li>
            <li>You know when you reach a certain age, it is all about magnification!!  </li>
            <li>The 10X magnification and size of the mirror is quite adequate.  </li>
            <li>I needed a little more magnification than the regular 3X and the 10X is just perfect.</li>
            <li>Plus, it really doesn&#x27;t matter how much magnification there is, if you can&#x27;t see the hair on your face, the magnification doesn&#x27;t do you a whole lot of good.</li>
            <li>Overall I am very pleased with my mirror.</li>
            <li>It has certainly has provided an easy solution to the mirrors she used to pack along on a trip.</li>
            <li>It fits nicely into my small travel purse and it even has its own carrying</li>
            <li>It is also good for those that have limited counter space.</li>
            <li>If I had bought this version first, there would be no need for me to have one at home and one for travel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough of how I love this mirror!</li>
            <li>It was exactly what I was looking for!</li>
            <li>Mirrors are clean and crisp.  </li>
            <li>Everything is great about this mirror except the fact that it is a little heavier than I wanted.  </li>
            <li>Great little travel mirror.</li>
            <li>great I use it everyday for eye makeup</li>
            <li>It was worth the money.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny.  </li>
            <li>While this mirror may add unwanted weight to your luggage, it&#x27;s well worth having at your destination...</li>
            <li>This product is sturdy ,compact an well worth the price.</li>
            <li>I am a senior citizen that travels frequently, and traveled for work for many years.</li>
            <li>Helps my old eyes see better when I have to pluck my eyebrows.</li>
            <li>Well worth it.</li>
            <li>This is a very nice little mirror, convenient and adjustable.</li>
            <li>On top of that, it folds into a nice little carrying case and doesn&#x27;t take up a lot of room in my suitcase!</li>
            <li>In other words, it is a good design and made well.  </li>
            <li>It is pretty hefty and wouldn&#x27;t fit in most day-to-day purses but would not be a problem in a carry-on or bigger luggage.  </li>
            <li>They were right.</li>
            <li>This mirror is great for close up viewing, but as a travel item, it&#x27;s pretty heavy</li>
            <li>Clear, 10x is perfect, and its not too heavy!</li>
            <li>A great little mirror for traveling!</li>
            <li>This little gizmo travels easy and well, folds up nice</li>
            <li>The mirror is not too big and is easily foldable to fit into your suitcase or duffel bag for travel use.</li>
            <li>The real reason I got the mirror was because I thought it looked kinda cool</li>
            <li>Great mirror for everyday and travel!</li>
            <li>Great magnification, not too much or too little.</li>
            <li>Folds away for easy travel fairly clear veiw</li>
            <li>I like the brushed look on the hardware, which keeps it easy to look clean.  </li>
            <li>I like this mirror very much.</li>
            <li>Mirror itself is fine, but it&#x27;s not attached completely to the stand (it&#x27;s meant to just sit in place)</li>
            <li>I love the brushed nickel finish and design.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Really made well!</li>
            <li>Make sure you place it (the cardboard) in the same place it arrives in to insure breakage.</li>
            <li>This is exactly what I needed.  </li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>but it seems  to be exactly  </li>
            <li>Exactly as advertised.  </li>
            <li>the EXACT height I need to see my face,.</li>
            <li>This is exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>It is exactly what it says it is.  </li>
            <li>Should last many years of use.</li>
            <li>and sure enough it did just that.  </li>
            <li>The first time I tried to use the mirror the weld holding the &amp;#34;U&amp;#34; bracket of the mirror to the stand broke.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>My wife loves this mirror and is exactly what she needed when we travel.  </li>
            <li>So just make sure it is unfolded properly and you are all set.</li>
            <li>This is exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li>The hinges can be tightened/loosened with a phillips screwdriver and the product is fairly durable, as I&#x27;ve dropped it a few times (not ON the mirror itsself) without breaking.  </li>
            <li>If you travel by car, have room in the trunk, then this might be a good choice, but it is heavy.  </li>
            <li>It would also be a good everyday makeup mirror.</li>
            <li>It satisfies all requirements: durability, space-saving, light weight, lovely black velveteen carrying bag, 10X magnification, adjustable to just about any angle.</li>
            <li>I love that it can fold flat.  </li>
            <li>This product is too heavy for travel--would be nice to have one as good but less weight.  </li>
            <li>Appears to be very well made and exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>bag!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I needed a good, small travel mirror with 10X magnification, and having fractured my spine</li>
            <li>This mirror is very heavy, which doesn&#x27;t lend itself to being a good travel mirror.</li>
            <li>I need to order a new one that&#x27;s not as powerful.</li>
            <li>Maybe I have a large face or something...</li>
            <li>but then it would be large for packing.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li>This mirror certainly fits the bill.</li>
            <li>When you get older, your eyes need this magnification for make-up - well, actually not really since the magnification allows you to see things you don&#x27;t see in a normal mirror, but better to see and attempt to correct the defects then to horrify others!  </li>
            <li>Seems to be pretty decent quality.</li>
            <li>very high quality mirror,could not be happier.</li>
            <li>Apparently, it was the right gift at the right time...</li>
            <li>Even comes with its own little velour carrying bag.</li>
            <li>Great for traveling love it didn&#x27;t give five stars because it is a little heavey but worth the little extra weight</li>
            <li>It has a nice heavy feel to it and folds flat for easy storage.</li>
            <li>It is way better than expected and is a very well made, sturdy product.</li>
            <li>This mirror is great for home use, but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for traveling simply because it&#x27;s made out of metal and is quite heavy.</li>
            <li>Have to hold it up real close</li>
            <li>Light enough to take it when traveling and</li>
            <li>but if you move the mirror too much it comes off the stand.</li>
            <li>Too much magnification for me</li>
            <li>Because of the magnification the mirror is great to use in the poorly lit bathrooms, or at a work desk in the hotel with a table lamp.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>Going out of town real soon.</li>
            <li>Had to get use to the 10x because I was using 7x but really needed 10x for doing my eye makeup.</li>
            <li>When I received this mirror I was surprised it was so powerful.  </li>
            <li>After a month of using the product, it has served the purpose very well.  </li>
            <li>Paid way too much for this un-lit mirror.</li>
            <li>Finding a mirror that adjusts both height and angle which doesn&#x27;t take up too much room wherever you need to use it?</li>
            <li>If you adjust the height or tilt it too much during use, after a while the screws do not hold and you have to tighten-them-up again.</li>
            <li>I would really be lost without it.  </li>
            <li>Again, I haven&#x27;t  folded it much</li>
            <li>and she&#x27;s ready to go.</li>
            <li>This worked very well as a travel mirror.  </li>
            <li>Much more convenient and the magnification was as expected.  </li>
            <li>10x magnification is as much as I can handle</li>
            <li>The mirror folds down for storage and the magnifying side has the perfect strength to see small hairs.</li>
            <li>Nice compact size -- smaller one (3&amp;#34;) would be too small to be very useful (think shrunken field-of-view).</li>
            <li>I used to use the hot pink caboodle that I bought when I was little to do my hair, this is a great replacement for it.</li>
            <li>It is taller and has greater magnifing than my other one.  </li>
            <li>Looked at alot of other mirrors and glad i chose this one.</li>
            <li>I was so excited about this product after reading several of the reviews</li>
            <li>Last trip, the weld that connects the stand and the mirror broke cleanly with no damage to the stand or mirror.  </li>
            <li>This folds up nicely, takes very little room in luggage.</li>
            <li>I bought it to replace a similar plastic one I&#x27;d had for many years but left by accident in a hotel.  </li>
            <li>The mirror is more expensive than most 10x mirrors</li>
            <li>Most mirrors only magnify some, this one lets me see to do eye make up finally.  </li>
            <li>If you use this for a week, you&#x27;ll quickly get spoiled when faced with the regular 5X magnification mirrors.  </li>
            <li>The footprint is small enough to fit in a desk drawer or suitcase easily and its good looks mean I won&#x27;t be embarrassed when others see it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s compact and a high quality mirror.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Works as well as high dollar installed mirror in master bath.</li>
            <li>Just what I was looking for that was a decent size and powerful enough to travel with.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s not practical in a normal bathroom where the counter is waist high.  </li>
            <li>The stand  is very sturdy and the mirror easily moves and stays at different angles and also folds flat for travel or storage.  </li>
            <li>Does not take up much space and not heavy.</li>
            <li>but my wife says the quality and material of this mirror makes it worth the extra expense.</li>
            <li>The regular mirror provides a somewhat distorted view, like a fun house mirror.</li>
            <li>It sits tall enough all on its own and is double sided. 10x and a regular mirror.</li>
            <li>It is quite top heavy</li>
            <li>If you move it at any time because it is top heavy</li>
            <li>I still prefer the 3\\&quot; version because my eyes are getting worse, but the 5\\&quot; version would be good for hair.</li>
            <li>This one is very fine quality but is far too heavy for today&#x27;s carry-on bags and it is also too bulky for putting into checked baggage.  </li>
            <li>but it is actually just right along with the magnification.  </li>
            <li>It is a little smaller than I would have liked</li>
            <li>I like to sit on my bed and do my makeup and was looking for a new compact size mirror to do so.</li>
            <li>they are very clear.  </li>
            <li>Good heavy duty quality - stays in place when you adjust it too - works well when  you are sharing a bathroom with 3 other girls on a trip!</li>
            <li>She loved the first one very much, unfortunately it broke on our last trip.  </li>
            <li>The mirror is large enough for all purposes and the reflection is clear.  </li>
            <li>I also use it at home because the reflection is pure, and what I was using at home was distorted, even though I paid more for the poor quality mirror I already owned when I purchased this travel mirror.</li>
            <li>The mirror is clear as a bell.</li>
            <li>Clear magnification.</li>
            <li>sturdy construction, clear mirrors.</li>
            <li>At any rate, he fixed it.</li>
            <li>However, if you want to use it at home, check before ordering to see just how much 10X actually shows.  </li>
            <li>Wife needed a replacement for her old one.</li>
            <li>and then it fell apart completely.</li>
            <li>I have recently taken this mirror with me on two trips and really like it.  </li>
            <li>and yet it&#x27;s not heavy in your suitcase.  </li>
            <li>And the soft bag it came with helps protect it when we travel.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just that I&#x27;m &amp;#34;roughly&amp;#34; 60 years old and the 10 X mag.</li>
            <li>I wrapped it in a little bubble wrap for extra protection in my tote bag and it was fine.</li>
            <li>It folds small and flat and opens to a comfortable hight and the 10x magnification helps with older eyes.</li>
            <li>Surprise, surprise both stands broke,  I finally  spent a little more money and purchased this mirror.  </li>
            <li>I guess we need to pack it a little better, maybe between layers of clothing in the center of a suitcase.  </li>
            <li>I got a new one, but I think they are still only 8x magnification, and if you&#x27;re paying for 10x, you should be receiving 10x!</li>
            <li>but because it&#x27;s so top heavy you need to be careful it doesn&#x27;t fall over.</li>
            <li>Going with a different style completely!</li>
            <li>(like it is designed to do), takes up little space, and seems to be a powerful (according to her, she is an OR Nurse) magnifier...</li>
            <li>It is small enough to fit in my luggage without any problems.</li>
            <li>I bought two already, leaving one at a relative&#x27;s house I frequent.</li>
            <li>As far as the actual mirror function...</li>
            <li>Boy, was I surprised when I picked up the pieces and the magnifying side said 8x on the back.  </li>
            <li>When I close one eye, it is clearer, but who wants to keep one eye closed when plucking eyebrows??  </li>
            <li>The first view is what I wanted (the rectangular one) and the second and third views are completely different than the first and are what I ended up receiving (the round one).  </li>
            <li>Most hotel bathrooms are poorly lighted.  </li>
            <li>big enough to see clearly but small enough for easy travel.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t as flat as my old one but having the stand makes up for it.</li>
            <li>satisfied though the weight was little heavy</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s big enough that if I need to use the regular mirror to check how my bun looks in the main mirror that I can actually see it.</li>
            <li>This is a nice mirror, but is heavy and a bit thick when folded for traveling.  </li>
            <li>After using the mirror several times, it has become apparent that one equipped with a lighting mechanism would be easier to use.</li>
            <li>I really wanted the rectangular mirror and now need to see if I can track it down.  </li>
            <li>The only down side is that although well made, the steel frame, when folded in the stored position, makes contact with the glass of the mirror making it a real hazzard when traveling.</li>
            <li>This mirror is very versatile: you can adjust it to be a handheld mirror or to set down on a flat surface.&lt;br</li>
    </ol>

            <li> This one is much superior in the magnification and clarity of the mirrors.  </li>

            <li> This is a good purchase.</li>
            <li> Not as good for travel as I hoped because of that.</li>

            <li> Good quality.</li>
            <li> Good value.</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s nice to have one that I can place on a counter.</li>
            <li> You can place it in many positions, and the magnifying mirror gives you a good, close look at your face.</li>
            <li> The ability to elevate the mirror to varying heights is a nice touch.  </li>
            <li> My wife really liked it.</li>
            <li> right out of the box........not very good quality</li>
            <li> Very nice items, fast shipping, great transaction.</li>
            <li> Easy to carry and fairly lightweight.  </li>
            <li> My sister said it was the perfect size and very clear.</li>
            <li> Folds up very easily and the protective case works like a charm.</li>
            <li> I love, love this mirror!</li>
            <li> The fact that it stands on its own for hands-free use and does adjust and tilt are a couple of its better qualities.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;UPDATE:  I have had this mirror for close to 4 years now, and it is still in great shape--looks as good as new.</li>
            <li> It is very comfortable to adjust height.</li>
            <li> It folds easily and has it&#x27;s own carrying case.</li>

            <li> I love this mirror.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s more of an accent piece in my master bathroom.  </li>
            <li> completely satisfied with the product and the price and condition delivered.  </li>
            <li> I love this mirror.</li>
            <li> This will serve me much better.  </li>
            <li> Overall, I am very happy with it though.</li>
            <li> I love that the height is adjustable making it perfect for me because I am very short.</li>
            <li> I love that I can change the height and the angle.  </li>
            <li> It is able to be moved/tilted into whatever angle</li>
            <li> The weld broke off between the top semi-circle and the bootom stand.</li>
            <li> did the job :-)</li>
            <li> My grandchildren love it too.</li>
            <li> I love this mirror.</li>
            <li> It has a nice adjustable stand for hands free use.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s my  favorite part about it.</li>

            <li> and it can be adjusted to many angles.  </li>
            <li> Would be better if the mirror pivot could tighten like the stand pivots do.</li>

            <li> this is a great product, product shipped extreamly fast, no problems or defects with product, recommended buy for anyone.</li>
            <li> I have a more $$$ lighted mirror attached to bedroom wall for most of my make-up application</li>
            <li> Love the side that has magnification.</li>
            <li> Many hotels do not have magnifying mirrors in their vanity areas.</li>
            <li> I thought I was going to being in love with this mirror.  </li>
            <li> I love the mirror and the magnifying mirror on the reverse</li>
            <li> I opted for a plastic travel mirror instead which worked out a lot better.</li>
            <li> Just right price wise also.</li>
            <li> This is great for those of us who don&#x27;t see up close as we get older.  </li>
            <li> Great for us older gals.</li>
            <li> The close up is great for getting the stray hairs that you can&#x27;t spot in a normal mirror.</li>
            <li> I loved this mirror at first</li>
            <li> and once I borrowed it during a recent stay I was happy to buy my own.</li>
            <li> However, because the mirror is a large size (a good thing)</li>
            <li> This is a very cool looking mirror.  </li>
            <li> A very good alternative to larger or lighted mirrors that I did not have room for.</li>
            <li> Quality was very good ... especially for the price.</li>
            <li> /&gt;the magnification is great for these old eyes to pluck eyebrows, you can hold it in your hand...</li>
            <li> Build quality is good, real glass mirrors, not chintzy plastic.</li>
            <li> With this swivel mirror on my desk, I can easily see who&#x27;s coming.  </li>
            <li> It is great for traveling as well as moving to around to a different room if you need better lighting.</li>
            <li> This collapsible mirror is easy to use at home or when travelling.</li>
            <li> was easy to pack when I was moving, but I wouldn&#x27;t carry it with me when I&#x27;m going on vacations</li>
            <li> The magnification works well and can also be adjusted easily.  </li>
            <li> maybe 5 x as 10 x maybe to strong for men may be o.k for women putting on war paint..</li>
            <li> you  need a good, portable mirror, I highly recommend this one.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, the product is nicely made and exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I really liked it for the first couple of trips.</li>
            <li> The mirror is just fine</li>
            <li> but it has worked just fine.  </li>
            <li> Works fine, if you have the the counter space, for a counter-top mirror.</li>
            <li> Fits in my make up bag just fine.</li>
            <li> It folds up nicely and is very compact and easy to pack.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s got a great brushed satin finish that matches my faucet and light fixtures</li>
            <li> This is a fabulous travel mirror.  </li>
            <li> It is not only versatile, but it is also really attractive.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy this mirror.</li>
            <li> but I enjoy the way it sits on my bathroom counter.</li>
            <li> The joints hold position very well, nice height.</li>
            <li> This mirror is great, especially for travel.  </li>
            <li> Great mirror, if only it would stay together.  </li>
            <li> It would be a great product if only it held together.  </li>
            <li> Perfect mirror for travel or everyday use.  </li>
            <li> Very well made mirror with a nice protective pouch.</li>
            <li> Reflection is crystal clear, it&#x27;s a good quality mirror with no distortion.</li>
            <li> It is just the right size to fit in my makeup bag!</li>
            <li> The magnification is just right to let me better see what I am doing.</li>
            <li> sometimes I see TOO MUCH!!!  </li>
            <li> Very nice for the low price.</li>
            <li> This is a great travel mirror and it collapses to a fairly flat package.  </li>
            <li> Exactly what my wife wanted - high magnification, good quality and value and easily portable.  </li>
            <li> so unless you have somebody willing to ride shotgun for you and show you the rough spots -- you&#x27;ll be perfectly preened in some areas and cat-like on others.</li>
            <li> They are well made and this one is sort of rich looking.  </li>
            <li> I broke my original Jerdon MC449N 5.5 inch Folding Two-Sided Swivel Travel Mirror with 10x Magnification.</li>
            <li> Worth the reasonable price for sure!</li>
            <li> It constantly falls over and I&#x27;ve tried tightening it on my own with a screw driver, I am pretty handy, but nothing worked.  </li>
            <li> It lets me apply my eye makeup with a lot of precision, and is overall good quality item.</li>
            <li> Overall - good purchase.</li>
            <li> Would be wise to loosen the joints before unfolding and then tighten just enough to allow it to stay positioned.</li>
            <li> packs well for travel &amp; has good magnification;  have traveled with it several times; it works well in a hotel room if there is a desk or counter to sit it.</li>
            <li> You can position it in so many angles and it&#x27;s also very sturdy.  </li>
            <li> Good especially for traveling</li>
            <li> ......really not a bad mirror.....</li>
            <li> With the natural aging process, my eyesight was becoming less than perfect.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light weight but sturdy and has just the right magnification options.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great travel mirror but large enough to use at home.</li>
            <li> You know when you reach a certain age, it is all about magnification!!  </li>
            <li> The 10X magnification and size of the mirror is quite adequate.  </li>
            <li> I needed a little more magnification than the regular 3X and the 10X is just perfect.</li>
            <li> Plus, it really doesn&#x27;t matter how much magnification there is, if you can&#x27;t see the hair on your face, the magnification doesn&#x27;t do you a whole lot of good.</li>
            <li> Overall I am very pleased with my mirror.</li>
            <li> It has certainly has provided an easy solution to the mirrors she used to pack along on a trip.</li>
            <li> It fits nicely into my small travel purse and it even has its own carrying</li>
            <li> It is also good for those that have limited counter space.</li>
            <li> If I had bought this version first, there would be no need for me to have one at home and one for travel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough of how I love this mirror!</li>
            <li> It was exactly what I was looking for!</li>
            <li> Mirrors are clean and crisp.  </li>
            <li> Everything is great about this mirror except the fact that it is a little heavier than I wanted.  </li>
            <li> Great little travel mirror.</li>
            <li> great I use it everyday for eye makeup</li>
            <li> It was worth the money.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny.  </li>
            <li> While this mirror may add unwanted weight to your luggage, it&#x27;s well worth having at your destination...</li>
            <li> This product is sturdy ,compact an well worth the price.</li>
            <li> I am a senior citizen that travels frequently, and traveled for work for many years.</li>
            <li> Helps my old eyes see better when I have to pluck my eyebrows.</li>
            <li> Well worth it.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice little mirror, convenient and adjustable.</li>
            <li> On top of that, it folds into a nice little carrying case and doesn&#x27;t take up a lot of room in my suitcase!</li>
            <li> In other words, it is a good design and made well.  </li>
            <li> It is pretty hefty and wouldn&#x27;t fit in most day-to-day purses but would not be a problem in a carry-on or bigger luggage.  </li>
            <li> They were right.</li>
            <li> This mirror is great for close up viewing, but as a travel item, it&#x27;s pretty heavy</li>
            <li> Clear, 10x is perfect, and its not too heavy!</li>
            <li> A great little mirror for traveling!</li>
            <li> This little gizmo travels easy and well, folds up nice</li>
            <li> The mirror is not too big and is easily foldable to fit into your suitcase or duffel bag for travel use.</li>
            <li> The real reason I got the mirror was because I thought it looked kinda cool</li>
            <li> Great mirror for everyday and travel!</li>
            <li> Great magnification, not too much or too little.</li>
            <li> Folds away for easy travel fairly clear veiw</li>
            <li> I like the brushed look on the hardware, which keeps it easy to look clean.  </li>
            <li> I like this mirror very much.</li>
            <li> Mirror itself is fine, but it&#x27;s not attached completely to the stand (it&#x27;s meant to just sit in place)</li>
            <li> I love the brushed nickel finish and design.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Really made well!</li>
            <li> Make sure you place it (the cardboard) in the same place it arrives in to insure breakage.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I needed.  </li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> but it seems  to be exactly  </li>
            <li> Exactly as advertised.  </li>
            <li> the EXACT height I need to see my face,.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li> It is exactly what it says it is.  </li>
            <li> Should last many years of use.</li>
            <li> and sure enough it did just that.  </li>
            <li> The first time I tried to use the mirror the weld holding the &amp;#34;U&amp;#34; bracket of the mirror to the stand broke.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> My wife loves this mirror and is exactly what she needed when we travel.  </li>
            <li> So just make sure it is unfolded properly and you are all set.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li> The hinges can be tightened/loosened with a phillips screwdriver and the product is fairly durable, as I&#x27;ve dropped it a few times (not ON the mirror itsself) without breaking.  </li>
            <li> If you travel by car, have room in the trunk, then this might be a good choice, but it is heavy.  </li>
            <li> It would also be a good everyday makeup mirror.</li>
            <li> It satisfies all requirements: durability, space-saving, light weight, lovely black velveteen carrying bag, 10X magnification, adjustable to just about any angle.</li>
            <li> I love that it can fold flat.  </li>
            <li> This product is too heavy for travel--would be nice to have one as good but less weight.  </li>
            <li> Appears to be very well made and exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> bag!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I needed a good, small travel mirror with 10X magnification, and having fractured my spine</li>
            <li> This mirror is very heavy, which doesn&#x27;t lend itself to being a good travel mirror.</li>
            <li> I need to order a new one that&#x27;s not as powerful.</li>
            <li> Maybe I have a large face or something...</li>
            <li> but then it would be large for packing.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li> This mirror certainly fits the bill.</li>
            <li> When you get older, your eyes need this magnification for make-up - well, actually not really since the magnification allows you to see things you don&#x27;t see in a normal mirror, but better to see and attempt to correct the defects then to horrify others!  </li>
            <li> Seems to be pretty decent quality.</li>
            <li> very high quality mirror,could not be happier.</li>
            <li> Apparently, it was the right gift at the right time...</li>
            <li> Even comes with its own little velour carrying bag.</li>
            <li> Great for traveling love it didn&#x27;t give five stars because it is a little heavey but worth the little extra weight</li>
            <li> It has a nice heavy feel to it and folds flat for easy storage.</li>
            <li> It is way better than expected and is a very well made, sturdy product.</li>
            <li> This mirror is great for home use, but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for traveling simply because it&#x27;s made out of metal and is quite heavy.</li>
            <li> Have to hold it up real close</li>
            <li> Light enough to take it when traveling and</li>
            <li> but if you move the mirror too much it comes off the stand.</li>
            <li> Too much magnification for me</li>
            <li> Because of the magnification the mirror is great to use in the poorly lit bathrooms, or at a work desk in the hotel with a table lamp.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Going out of town real soon.</li>
            <li> Had to get use to the 10x because I was using 7x but really needed 10x for doing my eye makeup.</li>
            <li> When I received this mirror I was surprised it was so powerful.  </li>
            <li> After a month of using the product, it has served the purpose very well.  </li>
            <li> Paid way too much for this un-lit mirror.</li>
            <li> Finding a mirror that adjusts both height and angle which doesn&#x27;t take up too much room wherever you need to use it?</li>
            <li> If you adjust the height or tilt it too much during use, after a while the screws do not hold and you have to tighten-them-up again.</li>
            <li> I would really be lost without it.  </li>
            <li> Again, I haven&#x27;t  folded it much</li>
            <li> and she&#x27;s ready to go.</li>
            <li> This worked very well as a travel mirror.  </li>
            <li> Much more convenient and the magnification was as expected.  </li>
            <li> 10x magnification is as much as I can handle</li>
            <li> The mirror folds down for storage and the magnifying side has the perfect strength to see small hairs.</li>
            <li> Nice compact size -- smaller one (3&amp;#34;) would be too small to be very useful (think shrunken field-of-view).</li>
            <li> I used to use the hot pink caboodle that I bought when I was little to do my hair, this is a great replacement for it.</li>
            <li> It is taller and has greater magnifing than my other one.  </li>
            <li> Looked at alot of other mirrors and glad i chose this one.</li>
            <li> I was so excited about this product after reading several of the reviews</li>
            <li> Last trip, the weld that connects the stand and the mirror broke cleanly with no damage to the stand or mirror.  </li>
            <li> This folds up nicely, takes very little room in luggage.</li>
            <li> I bought it to replace a similar plastic one I&#x27;d had for many years but left by accident in a hotel.  </li>
            <li> The mirror is more expensive than most 10x mirrors</li>
            <li> Most mirrors only magnify some, this one lets me see to do eye make up finally.  </li>
            <li> If you use this for a week, you&#x27;ll quickly get spoiled when faced with the regular 5X magnification mirrors.  </li>
            <li> The footprint is small enough to fit in a desk drawer or suitcase easily and its good looks mean I won&#x27;t be embarrassed when others see it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s compact and a high quality mirror.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Works as well as high dollar installed mirror in master bath.</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for that was a decent size and powerful enough to travel with.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s not practical in a normal bathroom where the counter is waist high.  </li>
            <li> The stand  is very sturdy and the mirror easily moves and stays at different angles and also folds flat for travel or storage.  </li>
            <li> Does not take up much space and not heavy.</li>
            <li> but my wife says the quality and material of this mirror makes it worth the extra expense.</li>
            <li> The regular mirror provides a somewhat distorted view, like a fun house mirror.</li>
            <li> It sits tall enough all on its own and is double sided. 10x and a regular mirror.</li>
            <li> It is quite top heavy</li>
            <li> If you move it at any time because it is top heavy</li>
            <li> I still prefer the 3\\&quot; version because my eyes are getting worse, but the 5\\&quot; version would be good for hair.</li>
            <li> This one is very fine quality but is far too heavy for today&#x27;s carry-on bags and it is also too bulky for putting into checked baggage.  </li>
            <li> but it is actually just right along with the magnification.  </li>
            <li> It is a little smaller than I would have liked</li>
            <li> I like to sit on my bed and do my makeup and was looking for a new compact size mirror to do so.</li>
            <li> they are very clear.  </li>
            <li> Good heavy duty quality - stays in place when you adjust it too - works well when  you are sharing a bathroom with 3 other girls on a trip!</li>
            <li> She loved the first one very much, unfortunately it broke on our last trip.  </li>
            <li> The mirror is large enough for all purposes and the reflection is clear.  </li>
            <li> I also use it at home because the reflection is pure, and what I was using at home was distorted, even though I paid more for the poor quality mirror I already owned when I purchased this travel mirror.</li>
            <li> The mirror is clear as a bell.</li>
            <li> Clear magnification.</li>
            <li> sturdy construction, clear mirrors.</li>
            <li> At any rate, he fixed it.</li>
            <li> However, if you want to use it at home, check before ordering to see just how much 10X actually shows.  </li>
            <li> Wife needed a replacement for her old one.</li>
            <li> and then it fell apart completely.</li>
            <li> I have recently taken this mirror with me on two trips and really like it.  </li>
            <li> and yet it&#x27;s not heavy in your suitcase.  </li>
            <li> And the soft bag it came with helps protect it when we travel.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just that I&#x27;m &amp;#34;roughly&amp;#34; 60 years old and the 10 X mag.</li>
            <li> I wrapped it in a little bubble wrap for extra protection in my tote bag and it was fine.</li>
            <li> It folds small and flat and opens to a comfortable hight and the 10x magnification helps with older eyes.</li>
            <li> Surprise, surprise both stands broke,  I finally  spent a little more money and purchased this mirror.  </li>
            <li> I guess we need to pack it a little better, maybe between layers of clothing in the center of a suitcase.  </li>
            <li> I got a new one, but I think they are still only 8x magnification, and if you&#x27;re paying for 10x, you should be receiving 10x!</li>
            <li> but because it&#x27;s so top heavy you need to be careful it doesn&#x27;t fall over.</li>
            <li> Going with a different style completely!</li>
            <li> (like it is designed to do), takes up little space, and seems to be a powerful (according to her, she is an OR Nurse) magnifier...</li>
            <li> It is small enough to fit in my luggage without any problems.</li>
            <li> I bought two already, leaving one at a relative&#x27;s house I frequent.</li>
            <li> As far as the actual mirror function...</li>
            <li> Boy, was I surprised when I picked up the pieces and the magnifying side said 8x on the back.  </li>
            <li> When I close one eye, it is clearer, but who wants to keep one eye closed when plucking eyebrows??  </li>
            <li> The first view is what I wanted (the rectangular one) and the second and third views are completely different than the first and are what I ended up receiving (the round one).  </li>
            <li> Most hotel bathrooms are poorly lighted.  </li>
            <li> big enough to see clearly but small enough for easy travel.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t as flat as my old one but having the stand makes up for it.</li>
            <li> satisfied though the weight was little heavy</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s big enough that if I need to use the regular mirror to check how my bun looks in the main mirror that I can actually see it.</li>
            <li> This is a nice mirror, but is heavy and a bit thick when folded for traveling.  </li>
            <li> After using the mirror several times, it has become apparent that one equipped with a lighting mechanism would be easier to use.</li>
            <li> I really wanted the rectangular mirror and now need to see if I can track it down.  </li>
            <li> The only down side is that although well made, the steel frame, when folded in the stored position, makes contact with the glass of the mirror making it a real hazzard when traveling.</li>
            <li> This mirror is very versatile: you can adjust it to be a handheld mirror or to set down on a flat surface.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Once he found a screw long enough he then realized that it had to be &amp;#34;metric&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> It will last a long time.</li>
            <li> Folds up flat.  </li>
            <li> This mirror folds, but not quite flat.  </li>
            <li> I bought this mirror for traveling but it is very heavy and it doesnt stand up very well.  </li>
            <li> I ordered this to replace an old travel mirror that had been lost on a previous trip.</li>
            <li> The 2nd one I bought was 15 x magnified, not near tall enough and you could only see one little area of your face and the rest was distorted.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> you will be intimately acquainted with blasted line wrinkle and age spot you couldn&#x27;t see before.  </li>
            <li> Not clear in the magnified mode</li>
            <li> Seriously, this has made tweezing my eyebrows much easier.</li>
            <li> I had previously purchased at different times 10x mirrors with a plastic stand.  </li>
            <li> And stooping down to see a short mirror on the counter is a drag.  </li>
            <li> She was a little concerned that the 10X magnification might not be enough</li>
            <li> After packing up everything needed for her two little ones there&#x27;s not much room for her personal things.</li>
            <li> The two pieces that had clearly once been sautered together and was now broken with no way of attaching them back together.</li>
            <li> Works well, but heavier than I expected.</li>
            <li> Reasonably heavy enough to make the stand quite sturdy.  </li>
            <li> all in all, it is and does what is expected</li>
            <li> I need and holds in place without slipping or needing repositioning.</li>
            <li> Not very practical for me.  </li>
            <li> But it was a pain and a half, and finally I realized that it&#x27;s bulky and heavy for travel.  </li>
            <li> Easy enough, but annoying if you are in a time crunch.</li>
            <li> Not too big  and  not  too small.</li>
            <li> I ended up buying a small mirror with suction cups on the back.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been through 2 other travel mirrors.</li>
            <li> For my needs it&#x27;s a little too big and heavy for a travel mirror, but I didn&#x27;t buy this thing for that purpose.  </li>
            <li> My only negative comment is that I bought an extra one for travel because it folds, but it is very heavy</li>
            <li> a drugstore which sometimes made me &amp;#34;nauseous&amp;#34; due to the slight distortion.  </li>
            <li> Can not understand the aim of magnification - not useful at all.</li>
            <li> It would not stand up so my husband had to find a better screw for the base of the mirror because the one that was in it would not tighten and thus would not support it.  </li>
            <li> It was poorly welded obviously as it was broken off when I received it straight out of the box.  </li>
            <li> It folds and also stands up without falling down or folding.  </li>
            <li> I fold it down when I don&#x27;t use it to save my desk some space.</li>
            <li> After less than 2 months in the bathroom, the frame began to rust severely.</li>
            <li> There were fingerprints on the mirror, so it looked like it had been previously returned and re-sold.</li>
            <li> I read previous reviews about the mirror not staying up</li>
            <li> (I returned the previously ordered 15x).</li>
            <li> The base collapses too easily.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It is a little heavier than my plastic one</li>
            <li> It is a shame that one of the mirrored sides&#x27; strength wasn&#x27;t a little stronger- 20x maybe?</li>
            <li> I was never able to do that with other mirrors of this size that I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
            <li> When I&#x27;m flying, I need something a little lighter.</li>
            <li> I usually listen to other reviewers, but didn&#x27;t this time.</li>
            <li> one little problem.</li>
            <li> My Wife loves this little mirror and keeps it in the RV.  </li>
            <li> A little heavy for a travel mirror.  </li>
            <li> &amp;#34;The only game in town&amp;#34</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t return it because it&#x27;s too much trouble...</li>
            <li> I bought one to travel with and one to use everyday.</li>
            <li> but I have trouble getting it to stand up.  </li>
            <li> What I got was a round, unlighted make-up mirror.  </li>
            <li> so I was really missing having one on the road.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a bit heavy</li>
            <li> This  was  not  important to me</li>
            <li> But the stand is hefty and heavy, which belies the purpose of a TRAVEL mirror.  </li>
            <li> I wish I hadn&#x27;t wasted the money.</li>
            <li> it is too heavy for the bottom to support.  </li>
            <li> Also, it is not light and if you are watching every ounce you pack, this one may be too heavy.</li>
            <li> But for me it was too heavy to justify bringing with me on an overseas trip.</li>
            <li> It is too much trouble to return, so will use the one and keep the other at the cottage as an expensive regular hand mirror.</li>
            <li> Would never purchase a plain mirror</li>
            <li> However, it is a bit stiff and may pose a challenge for the arthritic hand.</li>
            <li> Small, compact, durable and a little &amp;#34;classy&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> I purchased a small mirror to stick on my monitor, but that didn&#x27;t work well.  </li>
            <li> I am past 50 and putting on makeup requires precision, talent and eyes.</li>
            <li> Also, the glass of the mirror leans directly on the metal frame which makes me afraid that it will get broken with rough handeling of checked luggage.  </li>
            <li> Now I want the small version for the overnight bag...</li>
            <li> I was concerned about the size being too small</li>
            <li> but I didn&#x27;t have it long before it was unable to stay upright.  </li>
            <li> I kept it, but I have muttered some not very nice words to it!</li>
            <li> hard to maneuver.  </li>
            <li> It is hard to find 10x mirror</li>
            <li> AND I can put my makeup on at work for those days when I sleep too late.</li>
            <li> The base is very stable and keeps the mirror from falling over.</li>
            <li> The other is very poor quality 10X  magnification.  </li>
            <li> I just find it ot be awkward and NOT very sturdy.  </li>
            <li> Not good.</li>
            <li> The mirror arrived with the stand weld broken.</li>
            <li> This mirror was Broken...</li>
            <li> This mirror is the magnification I wanted, but because of the small diameter, it makes using it awkward.</li>
            <li> The only drawback is the base is a little flimsy so if you want the mirror and base at a 90 degree angle - it may fall over.</li>
            <li> needless to say when she was done she went on Amazon and ordered one.</li>
            <li> I have to put a book behind it to hold it up!</li>
            <li> There is nothing wrong with the mirror per se.  </li>
            <li> I was unable to go out and shop.</li>
            <li> but unfortunately I can&#x27;t speak to that.  </li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m sorry</li>
            <li> Definitely NOT happy with this purchase!!!</li>
            <li> like I do, getting the mirror to rest in the holder is difficult.  </li>
            <li> False advertising!</li>
            <li> Somewhat disappointing.</li>
            <li> Disappointing.</li>
            <li> But then the tension went bad and now it won&#x27;t stand up.</li>
            <li> there seems to be distortion, which means that  those stray cat-like whiskers that all women hate, can go undetected</li>
            <li> Besides, the base should be heavier than the rest of the mirror to keep it from tipping over.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s awful.  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> Good mirror.  Folds away nicely too.</li>
            <li> very nice, well made mirror</li>
            <li> This mirror is absolutely perfect for traveling! It is just the right size to fit in my makeup bag! The mirrors at the hotels are never magnified enough, and this does the trick!</li>
            <li> Like the case it comes in for traveling but it makes me dizzy to look in the mirror.  Have to hold it up real close so the stand doesn&#x27;t help me.</li>
            <li> Just as advertised.  The mirror folds down for storage and the magnifying side has the perfect strength to see small hairs.</li>
            <li> It would not stand up so my husband had to find a better screw for the base of the mirror because the one that was in it would not tighten and thus would not support it.  Once he found a screw long enough he then realized that it had to be &amp;#34;metric&amp;#34;.  At any rate, he fixed it. It works.  But it was a pain and a half, and finally I realized that it&#x27;s bulky and heavy for travel.  &amp;#34;The only game in town&amp;#34; it is the only one I&#x27;ve found of it&#x27;s kind.  So it will do.</li>
            <li> I had previously purchased at different times 10x mirrors with a plastic stand.  Surprise, surprise both stands broke,  I finally  spent a little more money and purchased this mirror.  I don&#x27;t regret my purchase.  It was worth the money.</li>
            <li> This product is too heavy for travel--would be nice to have one as good but less weight.  Travel bag needs to have substance to it.</li>
            <li> I love this mirror!  Worth every penny.  I bought it to replace a similar plastic one I&#x27;d had for many years but left by accident in a hotel.  This one is much superior in the magnification and clarity of the mirrors.  Great quality of mirrors and metal workmanship.  I love the brushed nickel finish and design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a little heavier than my plastic one but hopefully will last forever, plus it folds flatter in my luggage.  I like the cloth bag that came with too. Now I just have to not forget to double check I packed it when traveling.</li>
            <li> It had some scratch on the mirror. I didn&#x27;t return it because it&#x27;s too much trouble...</li>
            <li> When you get older, your eyes need this magnification for make-up - well, actually not really since the magnification allows you to see things you don&#x27;t see in a normal mirror, but better to see and attempt to correct the defects then to horrify others!  A great little mirror for traveling!</li>
            <li> This is a very nice little mirror, convenient and adjustable. The only down side is that although well made, the steel frame, when folded in the stored position, makes contact with the glass of the mirror making it a real hazzard when traveling. Some thought should have been put into the design to elliminate this issue. Instead you&#x27;ll need to use a peice of corrigated cardboard or bubble wrap when traveling with it.</li>
            <li> I love this mirror. I bought one to travel with and one to use everyday. Really made well!</li>
            <li> great I use it everyday for eye makeup</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with this mirror. Very good magnification. Folds up very easily and the protective case works like a charm. Recommend this for travel and office use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MS</li>
            <li> Very good product and worth the price</li>
            <li> This is a nice size mirror.  Light enough to take it when traveling and the 10x magnification is awesome.  I had one that was 7x, and the difference is amazing.  I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> This is a terrific makeup mirror, folds up conveniently for storage and is adjustable to the preferred height. My only negative comment is that I bought an extra one for travel because it folds, but it is very heavy so I am looking for something similar that is plastic and not metal.</li>
            <li> Mirror itself is fine, but it&#x27;s not attached completely to the stand (it&#x27;s meant to just sit in place) but if you move the mirror too much it comes off the stand. The mirror now has 3 chips in it from constantly falling.</li>
            <li> This was just what I was looking for.  I use it at work to apply or check makeup at my desk.  It is the perfect magnification for this purpose and the fact that it folds is great, because I can keep it out of the way.</li>
            <li> Too much magnification for me but otherwise appeared to be of good quality.</li>
            <li> The mirror is more expensive than most 10x mirrors but my wife says the quality and material of this mirror makes it worth the extra expense.</li>
            <li> Before purchasing this mirror I was using one I bought @ a drugstore which sometimes made me &amp;#34;nauseous&amp;#34; due to the slight distortion.  This mirror is sturdy &amp; very good quality there is no distortion in the image &amp; I like how it stands up you don&#x27;t have to &amp;#34;hunch&amp;#34; over to apply the make up.</li>
            <li> A little heavy for a travel mirror.  However, great to put on my makeup and contacts.  I bought two already, leaving one at a relative&#x27;s house I frequent.</li>
            <li> I have never even seen a mirror built like this one. It has to be the Battleship of mirrors. I was absolutely amazed at how heavy and solid this mirror was built. Still it was all form and function as well. Just the dog gone best I could have wished for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;dray</li>
            <li> This is a very cool looking mirror.  For my needs it&#x27;s a little too big and heavy for a travel mirror, but I didn&#x27;t buy this thing for that purpose.  The real reason I got the mirror was because I thought it looked kinda cool and it&#x27;s more of an accent piece in my master bathroom.  It&#x27;s got a great brushed satin finish that matches my faucet and light fixtures and it&#x27;s got a cool industrial/masculine look to it that fits perfectly in a guy&#x27;s bathroom.  That said, I&#x27;m guessing women will like it too.  As far as the actual mirror function... yep, it&#x27;s a mirror alright.  Seems to be pretty decent quality.</li>
            <li> Mirror is great for travel.  Most hotel bathrooms are poorly lighted.  Because of the magnification the mirror is great to use in the poorly lit bathrooms, or at a work desk in the hotel with a table lamp.  Easy to carry and fairly lightweight.  Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> satisfied though the weight was little heavy</li>
            <li> Got this for my mom as one of her xmas presents, she loves it!! All of her friends ask to use it and where she got it, when they travel to the beach.</li>
            <li> Great for traveling love it didn&#x27;t give five stars because it is a little heavey but worth the little extra weight</li>
            <li> This mirror is the magnification I wanted, but because of the small diameter, it makes using it awkward. Maybe I have a large face or something...I don&#x27;t know. I ordered it based on others&#x27; reviews and it falls short of my expectations. I just find it ot be awkward and NOT very sturdy.  The folding stand falls over on me a lot, because of the weight distribution when you try to stand it up.</li>
            <li> The mirror part is great but I have trouble getting it to stand up.  The base collapses too easily.  Usable.</li>
            <li> completely satisfied with the product and the price and condition delivered.  I want to order another one as a spare and a gift.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to you Richard for excellent service.</li>
            <li> I love this mirror. It lets me apply my eye makeup with a lot of precision, and is overall good quality item.</li>
            <li> This mirror is great for close up viewing, but as a travel item, it&#x27;s pretty heavy so it&#x27;s not convenient to take on trips.  Somewhat disappointing.</li>
            <li> Folds away for easy travel fairly clear veiw</li>
            <li> What the heck!?!?  I though I ordered a rectangular, lighted make-up mirror.  What I got was a round, unlighted make-up mirror.  I just called Amazon and realized the issue.  There are 3 views of the mirror.  The first view is what I wanted (the rectangular one) and the second and third views are completely different than the first and are what I ended up receiving (the round one).  How can different \\&quot;views\\&quot; be completely different items?  I really wanted the rectangular mirror and now need to see if I can track it down.  Very disappointed!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used it yet on the road. Appears to be very well made and exactly as advertised. I would purchase another if needed.</li>
            <li> I gave this to my daughter and she loves it.  It&#x27;s very handy for travel.  This is a good purchase.</li>
            <li> This is the second Jerdon mirror I have bought.  They are well made and this one is sort of rich looking.  I will take it for travel.  It is taller and has greater magnifing than my other one.  You know when you reach a certain age, it is all about magnification!!  Hotel mirrors just can&#x27;t do it.  And stooping down to see a short mirror on the counter is a drag.  This will serve me much better.  Just right price wise also.</li>
            <li> Works well, but heavier than I expected. Not as good for travel as I hoped because of that.</li>
            <li> Small, compact, durable and a little &amp;#34;classy&amp;#34;.  Great traveling mirror. We have bought several as gifts for our friends and family.</li>
            <li> I have a stationary magnifying mirror at home but I have to travel every week for my job so I was really missing having one on the road.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This mirror is perfect. I don&#x27;t feel like I am compromising with this travel version because it has an adjustable height and a great reflection quality. On top of that, it folds into a nice little carrying case and doesn&#x27;t take up a lot of room in my suitcase! If I had bought this version first, there would be no need for me to have one at home and one for travel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
            <li> Took on vacation recently--worked out great</li>
            <li> Reasonably heavy enough to make the stand quite sturdy.  Comes with a nice travel bag to keep it from getting scratched.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  I have had this mirror for close to 4 years now, and it is still in great shape--looks as good as new.</li>
            <li> Perfect for home or travel.  Whatever position you put it in it will stay put !!</li>
            <li> such as a mirror, I would</li>
            <li> The regular mirror provides a somewhat distorted view, like a fun house mirror. After less than 2 months in the bathroom, the frame began to rust severely. I don&#x27;t recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Very Nice for the price. Good size and I like the height and how it adjusts. The only drawback is the base is a little flimsy so if you want the mirror and base at a 90 degree angle - it may fall over. Overall, I am very happy with it though.</li>
            <li> The mirror is just fine and it&#x27;s cover protects it while in a suitecase.  However, if you want to use it at home, check before ordering to see just how much 10X actually shows.  I think a 5X would be plenty.</li>
            <li> While this mirror may add unwanted weight to your luggage, it&#x27;s well worth having at your destination...especially if you need the magnification for applying makeup!</li>
            <li> Clunky.  hard to maneuver.  Not clear in the magnified mode</li>
            <li> Perfect for using at home. It is very comfortable to adjust height. Can not understand the aim of magnification - not useful at all.</li>
            <li> Quality mirror.  It&#x27;s a bit pricey, but it is what I needed so I can&#x27;t complain.  You get what you pay for.  It folds and also stands up without falling down or folding.  It will last a long time.</li>
            <li> It satisfies all requirements: durability, space-saving, light weight, lovely black velveteen carrying bag, 10X magnification, adjustable to just about any angle.</li>
            <li> The mirror arrived with the stand weld broken. There were fingerprints on the mirror, so it looked like it had been previously returned and re-sold. Not good.</li>
            <li> This is the best magnification mirror I have ever purchased. Love the portability and its size is perfect. This was a great purchase.</li>
            <li> I purchased this mirror to replace a similar one.  I like the 10X magnification and also the fact that it folds for travel.</li>
            <li> This is a fabulous travel mirror.  Even though it is for travel, I use it for daily makeup application.  It is not only versatile, but it is also really attractive.</li>
            <li> Perfect size for travel and comes with velvet-type case to protect it.  Metal stand can be angled and stays put.  Reflection is crystal clear, it&#x27;s a good quality mirror with no distortion.</li>
            <li> Lightweight and perfect size for travel</li>
            <li> Love  it - perfect size for travel. Folds up flat.  I do recommend that you keep the cardboard and the bag it comes in for when you travel. Make sure you place it (the cardboard) in the same place it arrives in to insure breakage.</li>
            <li> This is a 10x mirror but it is not truly 10x magnified. I have an 8x mirror and the Jerdon 10x is about the same as my 8x.</li>
            <li> This mirror with 10x is perfect and traveling with it is also perfect!  I like the travel pouch that comes with it, too.</li>
            <li> I use this mirror each time I travel and it is wonderful.  It is small enough to fit in my luggage without any problems.</li>
            <li> Everything is good except the stand rubs the glass when folded for travel.</li>
            <li> I love that the height is adjustable making it perfect for me because I am very short. I&#x27;m very pleased with this mirror and it folds up when you don&#x27;t need it out.</li>
            <li> This is the perfect mirror for traveling (or in home use).  It folds easily and has it&#x27;s own carrying case.</li>
            <li> I was just on a trip,and took this mirror with.i was by the pool,and another lady was trying to pluck her eye brows but couldn&#x27;t see well.so let her use my mirror,needless to say when she was done she went on Amazon and ordered one.</li>
            <li> I have two of these. It is hard to find 10x mirror and I can not put my contacts in without this. I fold it and take it with me when I travel. I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This is the second time I&#x27;ve bought this mirror for my wife.  She loved the first one very much, unfortunately it broke on our last trip.  I guess we need to pack it a little better, maybe between layers of clothing in the center of a suitcase.  It does come with a velvet pouch for storage, but it&#x27;s not padded.  It folds small and flat and opens to a comfortable hight and the 10x magnification helps with older eyes.</li>
            <li> Wife needed a replacement for her old one. This fits perfectly in her luggage. Going out of town real soon.</li>
            <li> Bought this for travel to use so i can see when applying makeup and flossing  and trimming those stray hairs it&#x27;s a bit heavy and sometimes I can&#x27;t get this to stand up properly.  nice mirror and good magnification.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I needed.  My office is set up so that my back is to the door.  I purchased a small mirror to stick on my monitor, but that didn&#x27;t work well.  With this swivel mirror on my desk, I can easily see who&#x27;s coming.  AND I can put my makeup on at work for those days when I sleep too late.</li>
            <li> Love this mirror!!  It is great for traveling as well as moving to around to a different room if you need better lighting.</li>
            <li> ...dearest friend.  Apparently, it was the right gift at the right time...(she had just lost hers while we were vacationing)  This little gizmo travels easy and well, folds up nice (like it is designed to do), takes up little space, and seems to be a powerful (according to her, she is an OR Nurse) magnifier... all in all, it is and does what is expected...fair deal</li>
            <li> Works perfectly for the purpose of removing my ingrown eyelashes. A very good alternative to larger or lighted mirrors that I did not have room for.</li>
            <li> I sent this mirror to a friend in South America.  It is a shame that one of the mirrored sides&#x27; strength wasn&#x27;t a little stronger- 20x maybe?</li>
            <li> I take my mirror with me on all trips now so I can see when I put on my makeup.  I love that I can change the height and the angle.  The base is very stable and keeps the mirror from falling over.</li>
            <li> I use this mirror for eyebrow maintaining/shaping. It has a nice heavy feel to it and folds flat for easy storage. It is able to be moved/tilted into whatever angle I need and holds in place without slipping or needing repositioning. I have no complaints. the magnification is wonderful - you will not miss a stray hair with this mirror!</li>
            <li> Very good item. Handy.</li>
            <li> Nice mirror, but because it&#x27;s so top heavy you need to be careful it doesn&#x27;t fall over. I got the larger one, way too heave to travel with - in my opinion. I like to tuck it in my drawer, when not using. Overall - good purchase.</li>
            <li> My sister said it was the perfect size and very clear.</li>
            <li> I will now look for a different design.  The weld broke off between the top semi-circle and the bootom stand.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy this mirror. I don&#x27;t travel but I enjoy the way it sits on my bathroom counter. Had to get use to the 10x because I was using 7x but really needed 10x for doing my eye makeup. It sits good and I like the swivel part especially about.</li>
            <li> like the stand but wish it was like maybe 5 x as 10 x maybe to strong for men may be o.k for women putting on war paint..</li>
            <li> Mirror is very nice but stand is not sturdy at all! It constantly falls over and I&#x27;ve tried tightening it on my own with a screw driver, I am pretty handy, but nothing worked.  It&#x27;s awful.  I have to put a book behind it to hold it up! WOULDN&#x27;T BUY IT AGAIN but I needed the mirror so it served it&#x27;s purpose.</li>
            <li> Great price! Sturdy! Does the job! I like to sit on my bed and do my makeup and was looking for a new compact size mirror to do so. The way it folds compactly and fits into the included bag is awesome. That way it doesn&#x27;t take up space and I can put it away after every use. Used the magnifier side to pluck my eyebrows...did the job :-)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with this mirror as it is the perfect size for traveling and comes with a bag to store it in. It is also good for those that have limited counter space.</li>
            <li> I love, love this mirror! It exceeded my expectations. It&#x27;s lightweight, and folds in a travel pouch. The mirror is clear as a bell. The magnification is amazing. I&#x27;m so happy I ordered it. Plan to bring it with me on vacation, but I use it every day. It&#x27;s so convenient and adjusts height-wise so any age person can use it. My grandchildren love it too. Thanks!</li>
            <li> Very nice for the low price.</li>
            <li> I have owned this wonderful mirror for years now.  It has excellent, non-distorted magnification for close work, plus good normal magnification.  This mirror folds, but not quite flat.  Best of all, as indicated through years of travel use, it is durable!</li>
            <li> I love this mirror. It is a little smaller than I would have liked but then it would be large for packing.&lt;br /&gt;It folds up beautifully for tucking away in your luggage. The stand allows you to position it any way you want.&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> Great magnification.  LOL - Warning to all Senior Citizens... you will be intimately acquainted with blasted line wrinkle and age spot you couldn&#x27;t see before.  Seriously, this has made tweezing my eyebrows much easier.</li>
            <li> Nicely weighted. Good quality. Clear magnification. It is smaller than my wall mount BUT for travel it couldn&#x27;t be nicer</li>
            <li> This is a great travel mirror and it collapses to a fairly flat package.  I can&#x27;t think of anything I would change.</li>
            <li> As described. Good value.</li>
            <li> I am past 50 and putting on makeup requires precision, talent and eyes. Great magnification, not too much or too little. I will travel with this baby! Kept some packing material to cushion face of mirror. Came with nice bag for transport but folding it places the stand of it at a great angle to crack the mirror.</li>
            <li> I had to buy a mirror with a larger magnification when I got LASIK last year just so I could pluck my eyebrows.  This one is great.  It&#x27;s lightweight, stable, and a great size. I like the brushed look on the hardware, which keeps it easy to look clean.  I love that it can fold flat.  It&#x27;s big enough that if I need to use the regular mirror to check how my bun looks in the main mirror that I can actually see it.</li>
            <li> Great travel makeup mirror!!!</li>
            <li> I broke my original Jerdon MC449N 5.5 inch Folding Two-Sided Swivel Travel Mirror with 10x Magnification. Boy, was I surprised when I picked up the pieces and the magnifying side said 8x on the back.  False advertising! I got a new one, but I think they are still only 8x magnification, and if you&#x27;re paying for 10x, you should be receiving 10x! Amazon did try to help.</li>
            <li> When I received this mirror I was surprised it was so powerful.  I needed a good mirror so I could put my makeup on correctly.  It is nice, compact and does a great job.</li>
            <li> The mirror is compact light and perfect for travelling.  It is a good size.  It has a nice adjustable stand for hands free use. It great to travel with as not all hotels have this type of mirror.</li>
            <li> This mirror was Broken...right out of the box........not very good quality......really not a bad mirror.....if the stand stayed together all in one piece</li>
            <li> Very  pleased  with  product.  Just received  but it seems  to be exactly  as noted  in ad.  Nice pouch.  Not too big  and  not  too small. Note  that  this product does  not have lighting. This  was  not  important to me</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough of how I love this mirror! I&#x27;ve had it for 1 year this month &amp; it&#x27;s been the best magnification mirror I&#x27;ve ever owned. It is so convenient when traveling, it compacts so nicely...that&#x27;s my  favorite part about it. I was never able to do that with other mirrors of this size that I&#x27;ve owned. I may just buy another one just in case I ever break this one, I wouldn&#x27;t want to be without it! Love it![[ASIN:B002HRENPW Jerdon MC449N 5.5-Inch Folding Travel Mirror, 10X Magnification, Nickel Finish]]</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It is way better than expected and is a very well made, sturdy product. I needed a little more magnification than the regular 3X and the 10X is just perfect. I will be taking this on all of my trips with me.</li>
            <li> I bought this mirror because of the compact nature of it when on the counter and when stored. I was not looking for something to travel with, just have in my bathroom. I&#x27;m very happy with it. Great quality and not bulky.</li>
            <li> Exactly as advertised.  Mirrors are clean and crisp.  The hinges can be tightened/loosened with a phillips screwdriver and the product is fairly durable, as I&#x27;ve dropped it a few times (not ON the mirror itsself) without breaking.  I recommend it.</li>
            <li> I like the mirror except 10x is more than I wanted. It was damaged when I got it so will return.</li>
            <li> This product is sturdy ,compact an well worth the price.Looked at alot of other mirrors and glad i chose this one.</li>
            <li> There is nothing wrong with the mirror per se.  It comes in a lovely velvet drawstring bag.  But the stand is hefty and heavy, which belies the purpose of a TRAVEL mirror.  It would be nice for a bathroom where I could set it on a shelf the EXACT height I need to see my face,. But it&#x27;s not practical in a normal bathroom where the counter is waist high.  I ended up buying a small mirror with suction cups on the back.</li>
            <li> This is a nice mirror, but is heavy and a bit thick when folded for traveling.  It is well-made and is sturdy.</li>
            <li> I still prefer the 3\\&quot; version because my eyes are getting worse, but the 5\\&quot; version would be good for hair.</li>
            <li> I am Very Happy with this mirror.  This is exactly what I was looking for.  The mirror is large enough for all purposes and the reflection is clear.  The stand  is very sturdy and the mirror easily moves and stays at different angles and also folds flat for travel or storage.  Comes in cloth bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely recommend it.  Great value for the price</li>
            <li> Everything is great about this mirror except the fact that it is a little heavier than I wanted.  When I&#x27;m flying, I need something a little lighter.</li>
            <li> lscassel&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the magnification is great for these old eyes to pluck eyebrows, you can hold it in your hand... GREAT</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my wife.  It was a hit, she loves it.  I can understand why (not always the case).  It is a quality mirror that is well made and well balanced.  In other words, it is a good design and made well.  It is exactly what it says it is.  If it&#x27;s what you want then rest assured it&#x27;s a good product.  Should last many years of use.</li>
            <li> I bought this mirror for traveling but it is very heavy and it doesnt stand up very well.  Also, the glass of the mirror leans directly on the metal frame which makes me afraid that it will get broken with rough handeling of checked luggage.  I pack it in a washcloth before putting it in its carrying case.  In its favor, the clarity is excellent.  I will be replacing it with a suction type mirror that is lighter, easier to pack and doesnt take up room on tiny hotel counters.</li>
            <li> sturdy construction, clear mirrors. keeping the foam and cardboard to pack in the pouch in my suitcase. happy with purchase</li>
            <li> Great travel mirror! big enough to see clearly but small enough for easy travel. Worth the reasonable price for sure!</li>
            <li> This is a great travel mirror.  I also use it at home because the reflection is pure, and what I was using at home was distorted, even though I paid more for the poor quality mirror I already owned when I purchased this travel mirror.</li>
            <li> This mirror is nicely made.  The holder is attractive and very stable.  The 10X magnification and size of the mirror is quite adequate.  We have been very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> After a month of using the product, it has served the purpose very well.  I am very satisfied with this folding mirror.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted, just perfect!</li>
            <li> This company has quality control issues.  I have used many 10x mirrors over the years.  This one sounded good so I ordered two - one for a lake cottage and one for residence.  One is OK.  The other is very poor quality 10X  magnification.  When I close one eye, it is clearer, but who wants to keep one eye closed when plucking eyebrows??  It is too much trouble to return, so will use the one and keep the other at the cottage as an expensive regular hand mirror.</li>
            <li> This collapsible mirror is easy to use at home or when travelling. The footprint is small enough to fit in a desk drawer or suitcase easily and its good looks mean I won&#x27;t be embarrassed when others see it.</li>
            <li> After using the mirror several times, it has become apparent that one equipped with a lighting mechanism would be easier to use.</li>
            <li> This is great for those of us who don&#x27;t see up close as we get older.  Most mirrors only magnify some, this one lets me see to do eye make up finally.  Great for us older gals.</li>
            <li> very high quality mirror,could not be happier.</li>
            <li> Good magnification and it can be adjusted to many angles.  I didn&#x27;t take the trip I planned to use it for, but I can use it at home.</li>
            <li> This is THE BEST mirror I have ever found.  The one side is so magnifying.... sometimes I see TOO MUCH!!!  It looks nice on the vanity and stands well.  folds for storage or travel.</li>
            <li> I read previous reviews about the mirror not staying up and sure enough it did just that.  I loved this mirror at first but I didn&#x27;t have it long before it was unable to stay upright.  I continued to use it and then it fell apart completely.</li>
            <li> works perfectly, folds up nicely, good magnification.</li>
            <li> Great mirror for everyday and travel!</li>
            <li> The first time I tried to use the mirror the weld holding the &amp;#34;U&amp;#34; bracket of the mirror to the stand broke. The joints were screwed tighter than necessary, which put a strain on the weld as the mirror pivoted to the open position. Would be wise to loosen the joints before unfolding and then tighten just enough to allow it to stay positioned. Otherwise, the product is nicely made and exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I returned this mirror because I couldn&#x27;t find it&#x27;s focal point unless I was about two inches away from the mirror.  Not very practical for me.  I need to order a new one that&#x27;s not as powerful.</li>
            <li> Folds up nicely for travel.  Like the different magnifications. The close up is great for getting the stray hairs that you can&#x27;t spot in a normal mirror.</li>
            <li> Very nice items, fast shipping, great transaction. Thanks!</li>
            <li> Wife loves it - perfect as a portable mirror that fits easily in the cupboard, but handy when needed. she didn&#x27;t want anything that sat on the sink, so this was perfect.  Heavy/sturdy.  Sits where you put it.  Quality reflection from the mirror, magnification is terrific.</li>
            <li> Paid way too much for this un-lit mirror. Would never purchase a plain mirror that this price again.</li>
            <li> Finding a mirror that adjusts both height and angle which doesn&#x27;t take up too much room wherever you need to use it? It took years, but I finally found the one for me! Both my mom and sister had this mirror and once I borrowed it during a recent stay I was happy to buy my own. The problem was finding it at BB&amp;B - they no longer had it. It was a blessing in disguise because not only did Amazon have it, it was way cheaper. Best of all, the more-than-sturdy construction means I don&#x27;t have to worry about my large parrots taking chunks out of the frame. Now I want the small version for the overnight bag...</li>
            <li> Nice compact size -- smaller one (3&amp;#34;) would be too small to be very useful (think shrunken field-of-view). Would be better if the mirror pivot could tighten like the stand pivots do.</li>
            <li> Can put on my makeup without my glasses! It&#x27;s a great travel mirror but large enough to use at home. Would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> This mirror has one weld where the stand meets the support.  It was poorly welded obviously as it was broken off when I received it straight out of the box.  Sent it back.  Going with a different style completely!</li>
            <li> Great magnification and since it is portable and adjustable it is a perfect mirror for home and travel. Love that you can fold it up and put in the case for travel or place it in the vanity drawer if you don&#x27;t want to leave it out.</li>
            <li> Good heavy duty quality - stays in place when you adjust it too - works well when  you are sharing a bathroom with 3 other girls on a trip!</li>
            <li> I usually listen to other reviewers, but didn&#x27;t this time. They were right. This mirror is very heavy, which doesn&#x27;t lend itself to being a good travel mirror. Plus, it really doesn&#x27;t matter how much magnification there is, if you can&#x27;t see the hair on your face, the magnification doesn&#x27;t do you a whole lot of good. It needs to be a lighted mirror. I wish I hadn&#x27;t wasted the money. I gave the mirror away.</li>
            <li> I have recently taken this mirror with me on two trips and really like it.  It has enough weight that it can stand on a desk without falling and yet it&#x27;s not heavy in your suitcase.  Quality was very good ... especially for the price.</li>
            <li> This folds up nicely.  It works well.  I did not find any distortions.  The bag it comes with is a nice bonus to pack it in.  Does not take up much space and not heavy.</li>
            <li> This mirror is great for putting in my contacts and for doing makeup.  It&#x27;s compact and a high quality mirror.</li>
            <li> I like the bag  it comes in.  It is just as described. It is a must have for the traveler to use in applying makeup.</li>
            <li> was easy to pack when I was moving, but I wouldn&#x27;t carry it with me when I&#x27;m going on vacations</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B002HRENPW Jerdon MC449N 5.5-Inch Folding Travel Mirror, 10X Magnification, Nickel Finish]] is a perfect size with terrific viewing quality for my needs.  It fits nicely into my small travel purse and it even has its own carrying bag!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I needed a good, small travel mirror with 10X magnification, and having fractured my spine I was unable to go out and shop. Although, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d find anything locally of this quality.  This is absolutely perfect for my needs.  Thanks, Amazon for carrying this product and for the excellent service.</li>
            <li> packs well for travel &amp; has good magnification;  have traveled with it several times; it works well in a hotel room if there is a desk or counter to sit it.</li>
            <li> It was exactly what I was looking for! I needed a better mirror to help me &amp;#34;see&amp;#34; what I needed/wanted to see. With the natural aging process, my eyesight was becoming less than perfect. And the soft bag it came with helps protect it when we travel. Overall I am very pleased with my mirror.</li>
            <li> Great magnification. Big enough for home use. Able to sit at table and adjust height. Perfect for when I travel.</li>
            <li> This mirror is perfect for eyebrows.  I love the 10x magnification for getting the details and the stand allows me to put it in the correct position for use.</li>
            <li> This mirror is perfect for someone whos vision is not what it used to be.  I use it while putting on make-up in the morning.  The magnification is just right to let me better see what I am doing.</li>
            <li> this is a great product, product shipped extreamly fast, no problems or defects with product, recommended buy for anyone. A+</li>
            <li> My wife loves this mirror and is exactly what she needed when we travel.  It folds up nicely and is very compact and easy to pack.  It comes with a nice &#x27;travel sack&#x27; for storage.  She was a little concerned that the 10X magnification might not be enough but it has worked just fine.  It has certainly has provided an easy solution to the mirrors she used to pack along on a trip.</li>
            <li> This item is billed as a travel mirror.  I am a senior citizen that travels frequently, and traveled for work for many years. I ordered this to replace an old travel mirror that had been lost on a previous trip. This one is very fine quality but is far too heavy for today&#x27;s carry-on bags and it is also too bulky for putting into checked baggage.  If you travel by car, have room in the trunk, then this might be a good choice, but it is heavy.  The surface of the mirror is a bit smaller than I like for make-up application, etc. but the quality of the mirror glass is excellent and distortion free.  If you adjust the height or tilt it too much during use, after a while the screws do not hold and you have to tighten-them-up again. Easy enough, but annoying if you are in a time crunch. The fact that it stands on its own for hands-free use and does adjust and tilt are a couple of its better qualities.  I will keep it for at-home use.  I will look for a lighter-weight mirror for travel.</li>
            <li> I like this mirror very much. You can position it in so many angles and it&#x27;s also very sturdy.  Definitely buy it.</li>
            <li> I like to tweeze my eyebrows or do my eye makeup in the living room sometimes.  This mirror is very versatile: you can adjust it to be a handheld mirror or to set down on a flat surface.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The magnification is perfect too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All around a good purchase for someone that doesn&#x27;t have a set place to do her makeup.</li>
            <li> Had the mirror about 9 months without problems. Used only for travel. It stays in the carry on and is well protected.  Last trip, the weld that connects the stand and the mirror broke cleanly with no damage to the stand or mirror.  Disappointing.</li>
            <li> Perfect for my travel needs</li>
            <li> Great little travel mirror. It would also be a good everyday makeup mirror. I love the 10X magnification and it will be perfect for my trip to Europe this summer.</li>
            <li> I love the velvet cover that it comes with! I used to use the hot pink caboodle that I bought when I was little to do my hair, this is a great replacement for it. Thank you!</li>
            <li> It says travel mirror but I use this mirror just around the house.  I have a more $$$ lighted mirror attached to bedroom wall for most of my make-up application and I wanted one I could pick up and move with the 10X magnification.  I see where it COULD give out if you bend and flex it a lot for travel but unfortunately I can&#x27;t speak to that.  It is pretty hefty and wouldn&#x27;t fit in most day-to-day purses but would not be a problem in a carry-on or bigger luggage.  It&#x27;s just that I&#x27;m &amp;#34;roughly&amp;#34; 60 years old and the 10 X mag. is so great to help with make up application (eye make up especially!)  I would really be lost without it.  If you use this for a week, you&#x27;ll quickly get spoiled when faced with the regular 5X magnification mirrors.  Again, I haven&#x27;t  folded it much so I&#x27;m sorry I can&#x27;t help you with it&#x27;s flexability dependability.</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for that was a decent size and powerful enough to travel with. I also bought one for my daughter-in-law for overnight traveling. After packing up everything needed for her two little ones there&#x27;s not much room for her personal things. This folds up into her make-up bag and she&#x27;s ready to go.</li>
            <li> I prefer NOT to have to hold my mirror when I&#x27;m putting on my make up. This folding mirror is perfect for travel and at  home. It&#x27;s light weight but sturdy and has just the right magnification options.</li>
            <li> The joints hold position very well, nice height.</li>
            <li> This mirror fulfills the idea of a mirror that one can use two ways. It&#x27;s nice to have one that I can place on a counter. The mirror, as well as the stand are constructed to last.  Thank you  for constructing a product that doesn&#x27; fall apart.</li>
            <li> I needed a mirror that could travel with me and could be used on a desktop. This mirror certainly fits the bill. You can place it in many positions, and the magnifying mirror gives you a good, close look at your face. Its compact size and carrying case, make it a great item for travelling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you  need a good, portable mirror, I highly recommend this one.</li>
            <li> to be a travel mirror. Works fine, if you have the the counter space, for a counter-top mirror. The end.</li>
            <li> This worked very well as a travel mirror.  The hight is adjustable, it is compact when folded and I like the protective case.</li>
            <li> Great size for when you travel. Fits in my make up bag just fine. Love the side that has magnification. Helps my old eyes see better when I have to pluck my eyebrows.</li>
            <li> This mirror arrived to me in 2 pieces. The two pieces that had clearly once been sautered together and was now broken with no way of attaching them back together. so now I have this mirror that can&#x27;t be used as pictured above because it is permanently detached from the handle. Definitely NOT happy with this purchase!!!</li>
            <li> CLOSER THAN YOU MAY WANT TO SEE!</li>
            <li> I was so excited about this product after reading several of the reviews so I decided to take the plunge and order the mirror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Arrived quickly and in perfect shape, a good start. It&#x27;s sturdy and attractive and comes in a nice black velvet-like  carrying case which is great for when I travel. I wish the mirror was bigger though;when I&#x27;m trying to look to the sides of my face there seems to be distortion, which means that  those stray cat-like whiskers that all women hate, can go undetected so unless you have somebody willing to ride shotgun for you and show you the rough spots -- you&#x27;ll be perfectly preened in some areas and cat-like on others.</li>
            <li> For traveling and doing makeup on the road, can&#x27;t be beat. Many hotels do not have magnifying mirrors in their vanity areas. This folds up nicely, takes very little room in luggage. Even comes with its own little velour carrying bag. We bought some for gifts over the holidays and got a good price here at Amazon. My son uses his for dental hygiene. My husband for shaving. I like it for makeup. Thumbs up on this one.</li>
            <li> Great mirror I fold it down when I don&#x27;t use it to save my desk some space.</li>
            <li> I can See to put my make-up on!!! Folds nicely for storage in suitcase or on your make-up counter Would make a great gift!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for just this travel mirror with magnification for years. Well worth it.</li>
            <li> This mirror is great, especially for travel.  The height is adjustable and stands up well no matter how you place it.  The magnification works well and can also be adjusted easily.  Keep the cardboard separator, bubble wrap, and velvet bag that it comes in as it provides good protection when inside your suitcase.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife to be used during our travels.  The mirror is well constructed and the carry pouch is a very nice touch.  I was concerned about the size being too small but it is actually just right along with the magnification.  The ability to elevate the mirror to varying heights is a nice touch.  The finish and overall quality exceeds our expectations.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Great mirror, if only it would stay together.  The pciture makes it look like the mirror portion is permanently attached to the stand that holds the mirror in place.  That is not the case.  If you have shakey or arthritic hands like I do, getting the mirror to rest in the holder is difficult.  It would be a great product if only it held together.  I kept it, but I have muttered some not very nice words to it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been through 2 other travel mirrors. One was plastic and lighted but the lights did nothing and you had to sit it on a stack of books or towels to get the correct height to use it. The 2nd one I bought was 15 x magnified, not near tall enough and you could only see one little area of your face and the rest was distorted.&lt;br /&gt;This one is a home run!!! Not lighted but you don&#x27;t need the lights. It sits tall enough all on its own and is double sided. 10x and a regular mirror. Perfect for makeup and checking out your hair style.&lt;br /&gt;Only one little problem. It is quite top heavy so will fall forward if you don&#x27;t stand it in correct position. So just make sure it is unfolded properly and you are all set.</li>
            <li> Great item. My wife really liked it.</li>
            <li> Perfect mirror for travel or everyday use.  It isn&#x27;t as flat as my old one but having the stand makes up for it. Much more convenient and the magnification was as expected.  I wrapped it in a little bubble wrap for extra protection in my tote bag and it was fine.</li>
            <li> I thought I was going to being in love with this mirror.  However, because the mirror is a large size (a good thing) it is too heavy for the bottom to support.  If you move it at any time because it is top heavy it falls over.  The mirror itself is great.  I love the mirror and the magnifying mirror on the reverse they are very clear.  But I must take off the two stars because I have to prop the product up with books to use it.</li>
            <li> Gift for the  wife. Build quality is good, real glass mirrors, not chintzy plastic.No complaints.</li>
            <li> I really liked it for the first couple of trips. But then the tension went bad and now it won&#x27;t stand up.</li>
            <li> I am just used to a larger mirror</li>
            <li> Very well made mirror with a nice protective pouch.</li>
            <li> Good especially for traveling</li>
            <li> My Wife loves this little mirror and keeps it in the RV.  It is the perfect size for easy storage and the level of magnification is great.</li>
            <li> AWESOME!  Just the travel mirror I have been looking for!  It is completely perfect!  Clear, 10x is perfect, and its not too heavy!</li>
            <li> Exactly what my wife wanted - high magnification, good quality and value and easily portable.  Works as well as high dollar installed mirror in master bath.</li>
            <li> I need a travel mirror to do my make-up. This one has excellent reflective qualities. However, it is a bit stiff and may pose a challenge for the arthritic hand. Also, it is not light and if you are watching every ounce you pack, this one may be too heavy. When time to pack I place bubble wrap between the surfaces to prevent breakage.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I needed. I am not planning to use it for travel, so that fact that it&#x27;s a bit heavy doesn&#x27;t matter much. Besides, the base should be heavier than the rest of the mirror to keep it from tipping over. 10x magnification is as much as I can handle (I returned the previously ordered 15x). Good mirror.</li>
            <li> This mirror is great for home use, but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for traveling simply because it&#x27;s made out of metal and is quite heavy. I suppose if weight and space aren&#x27;t an issue for you when traveling, you&#x27;ll probably like this. But for me it was too heavy to justify bringing with me on an overseas trip. I opted for a plastic travel mirror instead which worked out a lot better.</li>
            <li> The mirror is not too big and is easily foldable to fit into your suitcase or duffel bag for travel use. It can also be used as a home product if that is what you desire. Sturdy construction though it is lightweight.</li>
