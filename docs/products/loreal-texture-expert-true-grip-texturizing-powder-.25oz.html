            <li>This product adds great texture to my hair!</li>
            <li>GREAT SELLER!  </li>
            <li>I love this product!!!</li>
            <li>Love this stuff!</li>
            <li>GREAT ON FINE WIMPY HAIR :-)</li>
            <li>good product for lift of fine hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t know how it would work with longer hair, maybe would give some lift at top.  </li>
            <li>Love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>Lanza used to have a shaker top with a twist cover that was perfect then they changed it to a flip top shaker (really hard to control the flow)&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>the two I like the way this True Grip is packaged better-</li>
            <li>For women with fine hair it is great to give an additional lift in places that are going flat.</li>
            <li>If bottle contained gold it wouldn&#x27;t be worth $25!</li>
            <li>great product to add some fluff to your hair.  </li>
            <li>This is new favorite hair styling product.</li>
            <li>It may work best for girls with thin hair.</li>
            <li>Well worth $$.</li>
            <li>Really wish I could remember the name of the original texture powder I used.</li>
            <li>I have baby fine hair cut in a pixie, and this is literally the only product that I&#x27;ve ever found that has given it texture and volume.</li>
            <li>I absolutely recommend this to anyone like me who has baby fine hair that is super soft, silky, slippery, and flat, and who wants some texture and volume.</li>
            <li>Had trouble with my delivery from my local postal office but seller stayed in touch and was great to deal with.  </li>
            <li>like this with the Anti Gravity root spray by LO&#x27;real.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t feel like much in the bottle</li>
            <li>I go through this fairly fast.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used texture powder before and this had no where near the same effect...still searching for a better product for my hair.</li>
            <li>I have used several texture products, including Osis Dust It and Big Sexy Hair Powder Play, and this one doesn&#x27;t give your hair the weirdo crunchy texture as much, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to do as much as the others, either.</li>
            <li>I have thick but fine hair and it works very well.  </li>
            <li>I have been a fan of Lanza Powder Up for a couple of years now and this product is nearly identical.</li>
            <li>Not only is the bottle tiny but the contents are enough for one or two uses and did really NOTHING!!!  </li>
            <li>Small bottle&#x3D; huge benefit.  </li>
            <li>They both do the same thing using a super fine powder to add- texture to the roots of your hair.&lt;br /&gt;Please apply very small amount by gently tapping the small container over the area you are treating.</li>
            <li>Adds lots of body, but be careful to not use too much.</li>
            <li>Be careful to not use too much as it hardens on your hair</li>
            <li>If you have thin hair, like I, this is a magic potion.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> A little goes a far way and gives me the volume I crave.</li>
            <li> Not a any better than the less expensive grip products on the market.</li>
            <li> Wish the container was larger , substance a bit less concentrated</li>
            <li> but you only need a little with each use.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t work quite as well when a lay person tries to use it.</li>
            <li> Does tend to make hair not so shiny, but that&#x27;s expected with this sort of product.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> The only downside, is that it is sort of hard to wash out.  </li>
            <li> Add a small puffs to the roots and then fluff your hair.  </li>
            <li> I like the way that it gives my hair a little volume and texture, but I don&#x27;t like the powder formula.  </li>
            <li> does make you hair feel a little fuller and hair stays in place longer</li>
            <li> I feel like I breath it in and it gets messy even if I just shake it into my roots.</li>
            <li> Too much and your hair will have a dull (dirty) appearance.</li>
            <li> I put some of this into a very small vial</li>
            <li> It just makes my hair feel dirty and thick.</li>
            <li> Very disappointing.</li>

            <li> Not only is the bottle tiny but the contents are enough for one or two uses and did really NOTHING!!!  Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> I like the way that it gives my hair a little volume and texture, but I don&#x27;t like the powder formula.  I feel like I breath it in and it gets messy even if I just shake it into my roots.</li>
            <li> I bought this after reading a blogger who suggested this product as her must have. It&#x27;s okay. It may work best for girls with thin hair. It just makes my hair feel dirty and thick. It does work though, but I can get the same results using different products that won&#x27;t leave a build up in my hair.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected. I&#x27;ve used texture powder before and this had no where near the same effect...still searching for a better product for my hair. Really wish I could remember the name of the original texture powder I used.</li>
            <li> I (stIupidly) paid twenty five dollars for this product.  As I look at the container that is the size of a sample product or one of those travel size products you find in drugstores for 99cents, I cannot believe this company has the audacity to charge $25.00 for it!  Beware!  If bottle contained gold it wouldn&#x27;t be worth $25!</li>
            <li> Meh... Didn&#x27;t notice any difference with or without it.</li>
            <li> I have been a fan of Lanza Powder Up for a couple of years now and this product is nearly identical. They both do the same thing using a super fine powder to add- texture to the roots of your hair.&lt;br /&gt;Please apply very small amount by gently tapping the small container over the area you are treating. Too much and your hair will have a dull (dirty) appearance. Then just rub with your finger tips to disperse at the roots.&lt;br /&gt;Between the two I like the way this True Grip is packaged better- it is easier to control the application. Lanza used to have a shaker top with a twist cover that was perfect then they changed it to a flip top shaker (really hard to control the flow)&lt;br /&gt;I like this with the Anti Gravity root spray by LO&#x27;real.</li>
            <li> No need to use all over your head. For women with fine hair it is great to give an additional lift in places that are going flat. I put some of this into a very small vial and it&#x27;s in my purse whenever I go out.</li>
            <li> great product to add some fluff to your hair.  Add a small puffs to the roots and then fluff your hair.  Adds lots of body, but be careful to not use too much. This is new favorite hair styling product.</li>
            <li> I have baby fine hair cut in a pixie, and this is literally the only product that I&#x27;ve ever found that has given it texture and volume. It may only be travel sized, but if you use it correctly, it lasts forever. I bought a bottle from my salon back in February, and I still have some left! I absolutely recommend this to anyone like me who has baby fine hair that is super soft, silky, slippery, and flat, and who wants some texture and volume.</li>
            <li> If you have thin hair, like I, this is a magic potion.  It is the best hair product I have ever used!</li>
            <li> My sister recommended it because her hair dresser used it on her.  It didn&#x27;t work quite as well when a lay person tries to use it.</li>
            <li> This product adds great texture to my hair! Doesn&#x27;t feel like much in the bottle but you only need a little with each use.</li>
            <li> GREAT SELLER!  Had trouble with my delivery from my local postal office but seller stayed in touch and was great to deal with.  good product for lift of fine hair.</li>
            <li> Small bottle&#x3D; huge benefit.  Use just a shake at the roots of the place you need lift and rub around.  I have thick but fine hair and it works very well.  Well worth $$.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s powder that puffs out and then thickens somewhat after a bit of time. I have greasy roots after regular hairspray but this one doesn&#x27;t give that problem. Be careful to not use too much as it hardens on your hair</li>
            <li> I have used several texture products, including Osis Dust It and Big Sexy Hair Powder Play, and this one doesn&#x27;t give your hair the weirdo crunchy texture as much, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to do as much as the others, either.</li>
            <li> does make you hair feel a little fuller and hair stays in place longer</li>
            <li> Provides lots of texture for short hair styles.  Don&#x27;t know how it would work with longer hair, maybe would give some lift at top.  Does tend to make hair not so shiny, but that&#x27;s expected with this sort of product.  A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I love this product!!!</li>
            <li> Not a any better than the less expensive grip products on the market.</li>
            <li> This product works well to provide volume to the hair.  The only downside, is that it is sort of hard to wash out.  I guess that&#x27;s why it works tho!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! A little goes a far way and gives me the volume I crave. Quality product I would order again.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  Wish the container was larger , substance a bit less concentrated cause I go through this fairly fast. BUT. THIS STUFF WORKS GREAT ON FINE WIMPY HAIR :-)</li>
