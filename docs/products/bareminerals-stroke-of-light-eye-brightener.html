            <li>This is great stuff!</li>
            <li>Wonderful product.</li>
            <li>Perfect.</li>
            <li>The best concealer ever!!</li>
            <li>This is a very good concealer.  </li>
            <li>It covers flawlessly and looks great on.</li>
            <li>The combination works great.</li>
            <li>Great spot cover too.</li>
            <li>Great coverage and blends well with their foundation.  </li>
            <li>It works great for under my eyes.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have really great skin, at 42, as a result of this (&amp; great genes)....</li>
            <li>I ordered the lightest shade since I am fair and it looks great.</li>
            <li>Love it best I have ever used.</li>
            <li>Good job</li>
            <li>&amp; I&#x27;m good to go</li>
            <li>Concept of this product is good, but it doesn&#x27;t deliver.</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I love this!</li>
            <li>It goes on very light.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very smooth.</li>
            <li>The search is over. :-)</li>
            <li>This is the perfect sheer highlighter.  </li>
            <li>I love this</li>
            <li>but once on the face feels more like a powder.</li>
            <li>I love this.</li>
            <li>I love this highlighter</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>It glides on smooth and blends in really nicely.</li>
            <li>I thought the color would be more neutral.</li>
            <li>I think it performs better than YSL Touche Eclat at a much better price point.</li>
            <li>#34;you look tired&amp;#34; even after a solid week of good sleep, good hydration and a healthy diet.</li>
            <li>Could go over another product as the shine of it is good, but what&#x27;s really the point in that?!</li>
            <li>Easy to apply, doesn&#x27;t give you raccoon eyes at all.  </li>
            <li>Easy to blend without pulling on your tender eye tissue.</li>
            <li>I think its easy to use.</li>
            <li>This goes on nice and smooth (love the applicator, very flexible) and stays all day without caking or creasing.</li>
            <li>is the best I have found to help out my dark allergy eye area.</li>
            <li>only thing you should be aware of is that its not the best concealer at hiding everything.</li>
            <li>Really enjoy this product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s important to note</li>
            <li>It is smooth and does not &amp;#34;show&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>Light weight and great coverage for dark circles</li>
            <li>have loved just about every product I&#x27;ve tried (possible exception is the hydrating mineral vail).  </li>
            <li>Its more in the middle ground between being able to cover a lot and the brightening stuff.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also tried others without success.  </li>
            <li>Apply it above your brows, bridge of your nose, and your jowl line to make a really nice difference in your face definition.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I have felt compelled to write a product review.  </li>
            <li>When you first apply it, you almost wonder if it will do anything.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gone through several tubes of this and it is still my favorite, go-to concealer.</li>
            <li>It looks like it balances out the redness that I have while minimizing the dark circles, like magic!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m one of the lucky girls whose genetics blessed me with lovely dark circles that leads people to say &amp;</li>
            <li>Then I use Bare Escentuals foundation powder all over my face with light coverage.</li>
            <li>Next, I use my Bare Escentuals Ready SPF 20 Foundation and spritz my face with a Rose Water &amp; Merula Oil mixture I made.</li>
            <li>I have read that this is really glittery, but I didn&#x27;t find it to be.</li>
            <li>I really like this</li>
            <li>absolutely does!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Blends in too much and doesn&#x27;t really give your under eyes a boost.</li>
            <li>Really brightens and doesn&#x27;t settle or get cakey.</li>
            <li>This was my third tube in the fairest shade, Luminous 1.The first tube lasted about 6 months, the second my teenage daughter wanted to try and never gave back as she loved it too.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have that overly concealed look, the makeup barely cracks where my 36yr old fine lines are starting, and the coverage prevents the &amp;#34;you look tired&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;are</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be finding a new product.</li>
            <li>It is very natural and non-irritating.  </li>
            <li>I first received this product in a sample size, luckily in the lightest shade (I have a pale complexion).  </li>
            <li>(my budget is pretty small), but I&#x27;m happy enough with this product to (1) purchase it again and (2) consider other products from the same manufacturer.  </li>
            <li>(I have sensitive eyes</li>
            <li>I use Bare Escentuals Prime Time primer first, then dab on this concealer and blend it from the outside in.</li>
            <li>I like it way better than all other expensive concealers out there because the coverage is well, way better.</li>
            <li>Just a small amount of Stroke of Light in the corner of my eyes, where my crows feet should be &amp; around my nose</li>
            <li>Bare Escentuals!</li>
            <li>Thank you bare minerals!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use the concealer brush from Bare Minerals to put it on</li>
            <li>( I save the brush for my Bare Minerals powder ).</li>
            <li>I use it as a concealer, and the bare minerals.</li>
            <li>GOOD!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been a Bare Minerals &amp; Philosophy girl for about 10 years.  </li>
            <li>I loved this product and was so sad when I lost it!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth every penny although it&#x27;s a bit pricey, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>I have dark circles (thanks to heredity) and this is the only thing that works without making it look like I&#x27;m wearing makeup.</li>
            <li>For my very dry &amp; sensitive skin, I use When Hope is Not Enough Serum/Moisturizer and Hope in a Tube or Eye</li>
    </ol>

            <li> For my very dry &amp; sensitive skin, I use When Hope is Not Enough Serum/Moisturizer and Hope in a Tube or Eye</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t really see it, except that it looked a little dry.  </li>
            <li> I dab a little bit on with the applicator (careful not to get too much) and rub it in with my index finger.  </li>
            <li> had been reluctant to try Bare Minerals products due to the prices of some of them</li>
            <li> That being said, it completely hides my dark circles that I&#x27;ve been hiding for YEARS with my glasses!  </li>
            <li> It looks so natural and a little goes a long way--love it!</li>
            <li> I have small, deep-set, and narrow-set eyes, and I think this really helps to make my eyes look a little bigger, as well.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like how it makes my eye feel dry, but it does lighten up the area</li>
            <li> As such, I&#x27;ve tried a ton of products to conceal my dark circles.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, minimizing dark circles is not the only use for this product, so I&#x27;d like to talk about how I do use it:</li>
            <li> Your search for the makeup that will finally hide dark circles is over.</li>
            <li> I notice a slight shimmer, but it&#x27;s definitely not &amp;#34;glittery&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a typical BareMinerals product in that it goes on so naturally, it&#x27;s not obvious you&#x27;re wearing makeup.</li>
            <li> I wish the container were a little bigger though!</li>
            <li> I put just a little around the inner corner of each eye.  </li>
            <li> It is a thin formulation, not thick like a cakey concealer (thank goodness!).  </li>
            <li> but it has a very pink tint to it that I wasn&#x27;t expecting.</li>
            <li> This product works well, however my skin is so pale that it does not completely cover dark circles.  </li>
            <li> Unlike a lot of the other reviewers, I don&#x27;t have dark circles under my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Keeps eyes from looking so puffy and dark underneath.</li>
            <li> Was looking for something to help with my dark circles.</li>
            <li> I have dark circles under my eyes, nothing I buy work and believe me I have tried everything.  </li>
            <li> When I received this and used it my dark circles were gone.</li>
            <li> (those are the dark areas for me).  </li>
            <li> And for anyone looking for coverage of bags or dark under eyes, this is not the product for you.</li>
            <li> if you have dark circles I would apply this after a coverup.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use a thick layer, just enough to take away the purple in my skin.</li>
            <li> I would rather have less coverage than a caked look under my eyes.</li>
            <li> This is not a full coverage product by any means, but it does lighten, and brighten my under eye area, and doesn&#x27;t settle in lines.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> I had to reapply a little moisturizer over it.</li>
            <li> Covered a few sun spots and used under my eyes.</li>
            <li> I ordered this concealer expecting another disappointed and was really surprised at the performance.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used powders, thick creamy concealers, thin concealers with layers, thin liquid concealers with powder, primers, and every technique I could research for application.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d tried that, and it does work, but putting powder eye shadow that close to my tear ducts was irritating to me</li>
            <li> I rub it on all of my troubled areas</li>
            <li> you can&#x27;t go wrong!  </li>
            <li> All of them settle in my lines, and look horrible.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This product is very awesome. I like it way better than all other expensive concealers out there because the coverage is well, way better. It&#x27;s worth every penny although it&#x27;s a bit pricey, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m one of the lucky girls whose genetics blessed me with lovely dark circles that leads people to say &amp;#34;you look tired&amp;#34; even after a solid week of good sleep, good hydration and a healthy diet. As such, I&#x27;ve tried a ton of products to conceal my dark circles. I&#x27;ve used powders, thick creamy concealers, thin concealers with layers, thin liquid concealers with powder, primers, and every technique I could research for application. I ordered this concealer expecting another disappointed and was really surprised at the performance. It&#x27;s a medium coverage concealer. I use Bare Escentuals Prime Time primer first, then dab on this concealer and blend it from the outside in. I don&#x27;t use a thick layer, just enough to take away the purple in my skin. Then I use Bare Escentuals foundation powder all over my face with light coverage. The combination works great. I don&#x27;t have that overly concealed look, the makeup barely cracks where my 36yr old fine lines are starting, and the coverage prevents the &amp;#34;you look tired&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;are you feeling ok?&amp;#34; comments. Good job Bare Escentuals! The search is over. :-)</li>
            <li> Keeps eyes from looking so puffy and dark underneath.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply, doesn&#x27;t give you raccoon eyes at all.  Easy to blend without pulling on your tender eye tissue. Great spot cover too.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t work for me.  I couldn&#x27;t really see it, except that it looked a little dry.  I had to reapply a little moisturizer over it.</li>
            <li> need to highlight areas of your face?  This is the perfect sheer highlighter.  It is very natural and non-irritating.  I love this</li>
            <li> Love it! It covers flawlessly and looks great on. I wish the container were a little bigger though! Thank you bare minerals!</li>
            <li> I first received this product in a sample size, luckily in the lightest shade (I have a pale complexion).  Unlike a lot of the other reviewers, I don&#x27;t have dark circles under my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, minimizing dark circles is not the only use for this product, so I&#x27;d like to talk about how I do use it: I put just a little around the inner corner of each eye.  I had read about a technique of using a bit of white/light eye shadow to highlight the inner corners of the eyes.  I&#x27;d tried that, and it does work, but putting powder eye shadow that close to my tear ducts was irritating to me (I have sensitive eyes and I wear contact lenses).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I saw that you could do the same thing with this &amp;#34;Stroke of Light&amp;#34; product and I figured I&#x27;d give it a try.  I dab a little bit on with the applicator (careful not to get too much) and rub it in with my index finger.  It works quite well in terms of brightness in that area, without making it obvious that you&#x27;ve used a cosmetic product to achieve the effect.  I have small, deep-set, and narrow-set eyes, and I think this really helps to make my eyes look a little bigger, as well.  It&#x27;s also non-irritating to my eyes, which is wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had been reluctant to try Bare Minerals products due to the prices of some of them (my budget is pretty small), but I&#x27;m happy enough with this product to (1) purchase it again and (2) consider other products from the same manufacturer.  This is great stuff!</li>
            <li> Wonderful product. Doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feel on your face...goes on liquid, but once on the face feels more like a powder. I actually saw an improvement in my skin (breakouts) after using it. If I go a day without it and go back to my drugstore concealer, HELLO ZIT. I don&#x27;t use the concealer brush from Bare Minerals to put it on ( I save the brush for my Bare Minerals powder ). I dot the applicator straight from the tube on my trouble areas. I use my ring finger to pat it in. Next, I use my Bare Escentuals Ready SPF 20 Foundation and spritz my face with a Rose Water &amp; Merula Oil mixture I made. This sets the make up and gives me a dewy glow.</li>
            <li> Really enjoy this product. Great coverage and blends well with their foundation.  Covered a few sun spots and used under my eyes. Perfect.</li>
            <li> This is a miracle for age related darkness around eyes , definitely seems to turn back the hands of time , I recommend this to anyone</li>
            <li> I have dark circles (thanks to heredity) and this is the only thing that works without making it look like I&#x27;m wearing makeup. I only wear eye shadow and liner so I don&#x27;t want my under eyes to have a cake like appearance and I thank my co-worker for sharing this with me!</li>
            <li> I love this. Was looking for something to help with my dark circles. This goes on nice and smooth (love the applicator, very flexible) and stays all day without caking or creasing. I have read that this is really glittery, but I didn&#x27;t find it to be. I notice a slight shimmer, but it&#x27;s definitely not &amp;#34;glittery&amp;#34;. I ordered the lightest shade since I am fair and it looks great.</li>
            <li> I have dark circles under my eyes, nothing I buy work and believe me I have tried everything.  When I received this and used it my dark circles were gone. I could not believe it.  You can put this under your eyes of a night and if you don&#x27;t work use it again in the am. This item will be my number one keeper.  Ladies please try this.</li>
            <li> I use it as a concealer, and the bare minerals. It makes you feel like you are wearing nothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Vickie</li>
            <li> This is a very good concealer.  I put it on after another concealer and it just lightens things up well.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I appreciate the applicator. I think its easy to use. I rub it on all of my troubled areas and then I run it in with my finger. It works great for under my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing you should be aware of is that its not the best concealer at hiding everything. Its more in the middle ground between being able to cover a lot and the brightening stuff.</li>
            <li> I love this highlighter</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have felt compelled to write a product review.  It&#x27;s THAT GOOD!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been a Bare Minerals &amp; Philosophy girl for about 10 years.  I have really great skin, at 42, as a result of this (&amp; great genes)....I look like I&#x27;m 32.  For my very dry &amp; sensitive skin, I use When Hope is Not Enough Serum/Moisturizer and Hope in a Tube or Eye Believe eye treatments in addition to my Purity &amp; Microderm Exfoliating Wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s important to note this is not a concealer but rather a brightener.  That being said, it completely hides my dark circles that I&#x27;ve been hiding for YEARS with my glasses!  After returning from winter break, everyone commented on how well rested I looked (I have used well rested in the past...and occasionally as a concealer...with no comments!).  Just a small amount of Stroke of Light in the corner of my eyes, where my crows feet should be &amp; around my nose &amp; I&#x27;m good to go (those are the dark areas for me).  I almost don&#x27;t even need my BM foundation.  It looks like it balances out the redness that I have while minimizing the dark circles, like magic!  It is a thin formulation, not thick like a cakey concealer (thank goodness!).  It goes on very light.  When you first apply it, you almost wonder if it will do anything.  And it absolutely does!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have loved just about every product I&#x27;ve tried (possible exception is the hydrating mineral vail).  If you&#x27;re looking for a brightener, give this a try...you can&#x27;t go wrong!  I have purchased Philosophy&#x27;s brightener (now color corrector/concealer duo) which I thought was too greasy.  I&#x27;ve also tried others without success.  Hope this helps with your decision!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amy</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok. I don&#x27;t like how it makes my eye feel dry, but it does lighten up the area</li>
            <li> Concept of this product is good, but it doesn&#x27;t deliver. Blends in too much and doesn&#x27;t really give your under eyes a boost. And for anyone looking for coverage of bags or dark under eyes, this is not the product for you. Could go over another product as the shine of it is good, but what&#x27;s really the point in that?! I&#x27;ll be finding a new product.</li>
            <li> I love this! I use it as an under eye concealer and an occasional concealer for pimples. It glides on smooth and blends in really nicely.</li>
            <li> I am in my 50&#x27;s, and I have tried everything for under my eyes. All of them settle in my lines, and look horrible. This is not a full coverage product by any means, but it does lighten, and brighten my under eye area, and doesn&#x27;t settle in lines.&lt;br /&gt;This is the best I have found to help out my dark allergy eye area. I would rather have less coverage than a caked look under my eyes. I also use it to highlight my cheek bone.</li>
            <li> Love it best I have ever used.</li>
            <li> Really brightens and doesn&#x27;t settle or get cakey. I&#x27;ve gone through several tubes of this and it is still my favorite, go-to concealer.</li>
            <li> Your search for the makeup that will finally hide dark circles is over. It&#x27;s a typical BareMinerals product in that it goes on so naturally, it&#x27;s not obvious you&#x27;re wearing makeup. This makeup serves a dual purpose as a highlighter as well. Apply it above your brows, bridge of your nose, and your jowl line to make a really nice difference in your face definition. I wish they sold this in larger quantities.</li>
            <li> I like the product but it has a very pink tint to it that I wasn&#x27;t expecting. I thought the color would be more neutral. I do like the feel of the product though. It&#x27;s very smooth.</li>
            <li> This product works well, however my skin is so pale that it does not completely cover dark circles.  It is smooth and does not &amp;#34;show&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> The best concealer ever!! It looks so natural and a little goes a long way--love it!</li>
            <li> I loved this product and was so sad when I lost it!</li>
            <li> Light weight and great coverage for dark circles</li>
            <li> This was my third tube in the fairest shade, Luminous 1.The first tube lasted about 6 months, the second my teenage daughter wanted to try and never gave back as she loved it too. It is an illuminator, not a coverup, so if you have dark circles I would apply this after a coverup.  I think it performs better than YSL Touche Eclat at a much better price point. I hope this is never discontinued!</li>
