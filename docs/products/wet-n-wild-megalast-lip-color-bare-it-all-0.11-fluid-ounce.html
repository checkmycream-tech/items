            <li>The quality is amazing as well.</li>
            <li>but with a bit of lip gloss it is amazing.</li>
            <li>Nice color.  </li>
            <li>I honestly don&#x27;t understand why people like this lipstick.</li>
            <li>For those of you who need/like shine, FYI this product is very matte but wonderful nonetheless.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice nude color.</li>
            <li>nice nude.</li>
            <li>The color is nice but it \\&quot;feathers\\</li>
            <li>I was looking for this kind of lipstick for like a year  </li>
            <li>Nice nude lipstick for my skin tone.</li>
            <li>The claims are off but it is a nice color and no chemical smell or taste.</li>
            <li>I love the color! :)</li>
            <li>so I have to put some kind of gloss on top.  </li>
            <li>works nicely with a gloss over the top.</li>
            <li>Love, love, love, it!</li>
            <li>This color in particular is very gorgeous.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re very cheap and affordable.</li>
            <li>really is beautiful if you&#x27;re looking for a nice, natural looking nude.</li>
            <li>This is a super good deal and the color</li>
            <li>Its the PERFECT nude color for me, It last all day.</li>
            <li>I wear this more than my Mac lipstick.  </li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>I love the color, and it looks just as advertised.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t wait to go by more of these.</li>
            <li>but this one is more of a brownish tan.</li>
            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t not look cute</li>
            <li>What more could you ask for from a lipstick?  </li>
            <li>Definitely recommend this lipstick - it is the best lipstick I have ever found.  </li>
            <li>Add for more words.</li>
            <li>I love having this with me at all times.</li>
            <li>I love that it is so inexpensive as well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>:) (you can buy a separate one just for this purpose if you&#x27;d like)&lt;br</li>
            <li>34;buy one get one 50% off&amp;#34; or even better &amp;#34;buy one get one free&amp;#34; deal.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s solidly okay.</li>
            <li>Meh, it&#x27;s okay.  </li>
            <li>the price is even better.</li>
            <li>This is just ok in my opinion.</li>
            <li>I thought the color would be more pinkish-brown, but it&#x27;s the color of medium foundation.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the perfect amount to bring some solid color to my lips and it stays on all day.  </li>
            <li>Love this color, it&#x27;s so creamy and pigmented</li>
            <li>I like to apply a shiny nude gloss on top.</li>
            <li>I fell in love with the color</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s stunning.</li>
            <li>Still stunning color :)</li>
            <li>Love this color</li>
            <li>and i absolutely love this lipstick.</li>
            <li>will buy from this shop again! :)</li>
            <li>awesome n simple color</li>
            <li>I have an olive/yellow tone complexion and it looks more tan on my skin tone.</li>
            <li>is still my favorite nude lipstick, i choose this over my mac because it is just as pigmented but so inexpensive.</li>
            <li>Cute</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in love with this lipstick.</li>
            <li>I thought i would like the color more...</li>
            <li>, I love the color.&lt;br /&gt;is</li>
            <li>i love it</li>
            <li>i will buy more for sure</li>
            <li>The consistency is very similar and the coloring is perfect.</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li>Love the product, stays on well too.</li>
            <li>I love the color.</li>
            <li>The color is good and it stays on pretty well.</li>
            <li>Great color for someone not interested in wearing bright lipstick during the day.</li>
            <li>great color for brunette who want a natural look.  </li>
            <li>I was looking for an every day nude that would be good for work and wasn&#x27;t having much luck</li>
            <li>Great color, long lasting, great price!  </li>
            <li>However I loved the finish, it&#x27;s natural and more on the matte side</li>
            <li>so I wear it with a lip gloss and it works fine.</li>
            <li>It would be fine if you like the matte lipsticks</li>
            <li>is that me so lucky or is it okay for 7$ deal?</li>
            <li>, it goes on smoothly and feels fine on my lips.</li>
            <li>It is literally a light brown chocolate looking lipstick.</li>
            <li>It also has fantastic pigmentation.</li>
            <li>Excellent pigmentation, great nude color, like all Wet N Wild lipsticks is very drying</li>
            <li>Such a great dupe for Velvet Teddy by Mac.</li>
            <li>I bought this because I was too cheap to spend my cash on a lipstick by Mac...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely worth a try if you don&#x27;t feel like spending $16 or more for hi-end.</li>
            <li>Other than that, it applies very smooth and looks great.</li>
            <li>Just plain beautiful!</li>
            <li>Still a pretty color though!!</li>
            <li>This is my new favorite lipstick, i am planning on buying more colors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty tan more like a medium beige</li>
            <li>Great as an everyday lipstick definitely impressed with wet n wilds pigments.</li>
            <li>Retails for under $2, but I was willing to pay a higher price to make my own judgments.  </li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s super cheap.</li>
            <li>Put a light balm on and blot gently before applying the lipstick and it&#x27;ll last beautifully for hours.</li>
            <li>I am a fair skinned blonde girl in my mid/late twenties.  </li>
            <li>gave it five stars because, it came early and was packaged nicely.</li>
            <li>but the color still looks good and I&#x27;ve worn it almost daily.</li>
            <li>I do find that it wears off extremely fast (hour or so into wearing it), so be sure to bring it along wherever you go.</li>
            <li>I was really surprised how nice this lipstick is.</li>
            <li>So if your fair skin, it will definitely be on the brownish side on you.</li>
            <li>It is true to the word nude.</li>
            <li>I wear a W7 in L&#x27;oreal&#x27;s True Match, to give you reference.</li>
            <li>Love the colors but very drying.</li>
            <li>I wish it was more of a silver skin tone, will work best with people who wear gold I think, but I like it with a slight bit of pink on top.</li>
            <li>Lipstick is super drying on the lips.</li>
            <li>Just swipe and rub in quickly.</li>
            <li>arrived quickly and well packed.  </li>
            <li>The item arrived on time and packaged adequately.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t look great on dark skin.</li>
            <li>Color 5/5 - Very pretty nudy</li>
            <li>Beautiful color to my pale skin.</li>
            <li>color was good, but I thought it was dry,.</li>
            <li>Not very great, but it&#x27;s a very good price for what you get.</li>
            <li>Great everyday color.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 1/4 Mexican, so I get a nice golden tan, but with any way I do my eye makeup or</li>
            <li>The product itself is worth the price and is one of my favorites in nude shades.  </li>
            <li>but it is all worth it.  </li>
            <li>I add a clear lip gloss on top to give my lips the plumpest look.</li>
            <li>Worth it though.</li>
            <li>formula is very creamy consistency stays on fades alil during the day but other than that great lipstick..:DDD</li>
            <li>Very nice for an everyday look.</li>
            <li>Good neutral color and not brown nor pink!</li>
            <li>This adds just the right amount of matte color I need.</li>
            <li>Saw this on pinterest,color is a beautiful pinky nude and long lasting</li>
            <li>Before I would only use higher end cosmetics thinking the quality was far superior to any drug store cosmetic.</li>
            <li>The color is pretty though.</li>
            <li>I had much higher expectations with the color.</li>
            <li>Being an older woman I don&#x27;t care for bold colors.</li>
            <li>But when I first tried it on, it looked like I put chocolate on my lips.</li>
            <li>Really nice color; however it is a bit lighter than what I expected.</li>
            <li>Pretty color</li>
            <li>and it dries pretty matte.</li>
            <li>My package arrived today, exactly when they said it would</li>
            <li>Very pigmented!</li>
            <li>Love the color, wish I would have checked my local Walgreen&#x27;s before ordering on line.</li>
            <li>It was so cheap and the color is awesome (bare) for that look in lipstick.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a little bit dry, but just add a dab of lip balm for the matte look, or a dab of lip gloss for the shine look...</li>
            <li>The color is OK, but for my medium olive complexion it is a little light.  </li>
            <li>a great everyday color that looks natural</li>
            <li>Mixes nicely with my gloss or chapstick (to get rid of the classic, dry lipstick feeling.)</li>
            <li>Works well with a little lip gloss on top or if not it is a true matte color.  </li>
            <li>Dry, but love the color.  </li>
            <li>Like most matte colors it gets dry after a couple of hours.</li>
            <li>like how it&#x27;s easy to put on, it matches with my skin somewhat, and it&#x27;s just overall</li>
            <li>A nice brown nude, if not a little dry.  </li>
            <li>Probably will not be able to wear it during the winter when I struggle with very dry lips.</li>
            <li>They color is also very flattering.</li>
            <li>My skin color is kinda medium light brown with yellow undertones.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t like the color much.</li>
            <li>I LOVE wet n wild matte lipstick line!!!</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t stay on too long, but it&#x27;s easy to apply.</li>
            <li>I really love these wet n wild lipsticks very much.</li>
            <li>This is a nice, creamy lipstick that actually feels moisturizing and stays on for a long time!</li>
            <li>the only difference is Jordana&#x27;s color is more skin tone like your lips and bare it all by Wet N Wild is lighter more of a nude.</li>
            <li>I have done this plenty of times and it gives me a pretty and natural &amp;#34;glow-from-within&amp;#34; appearance.</li>
            <li>I just wish it had a little more moisture in it.</li>
            <li>Gorgeous color, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>I LOVED IT and definitely will try other colours!!!</li>
            <li>All in all, it&#x27;s worth the buy, especially for the price.</li>
            <li>All of the other Wet and Wild Shades in the black packaging are beautiful too!</li>
            <li>I use it with a light brown liner and I top it of with a pale pink gloss, talk about bring all the boys to the yard!</li>
            <li>Great everyday color for year round.</li>
            <li>This still looks pink on my lips, as I&#x27;m not super fair or super dark.</li>
            <li>It is long lasting and applies smooth with no streaks.</li>
            <li>I always find myself getting lipstick on the clear cap part of it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s probably a step or two darker than my natural lip coloring.</li>
            <li>I pair this with Natural lip liner by NYX.</li>
            <li>wild and will taste.</li>
            <li>Much cheaper at local drugstore.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Pigmentation 5/5 - Very, very verrryy pigmented&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;overall, very well round product.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know what all the raving is about with this particular lipstick, but definitely isn&#x27;t all it&#x27;s cracked up to be.</li>
            <li>and i could finally find something that stays for a long time and has a very pure colour.</li>
            <li>The color is also very pretty, just maybe not an &#x27;everyday&#x27; natural look with my coloring (still gonna wear it 😁).</li>
            <li>I apply lip balm first, blot that off, apply some medium pink lip liner and then blot this color on.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a medium skin color and it was a little more brown that I expected</li>
            <li>Its a creamy formula and doesn&#x27;t dry up fast at all.</li>
            <li>Love the color only complaint is it doesn&#x27;t stay as well as my mac lipstick</li>
            <li>Not pink or even pinkish!</li>
            <li>It is very dry and settles in my lip lines too much.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m not really a big fan of this lipstick, but it&#x27;s perfectly fine if you can get past the struggle of putting it on.</li>
            <li>There was a little smudge at the top of the cap and the lipstick doesn&#x27;t roll up and down</li>
            <li>not pink or peach, just medium tan.</li>
            <li>I prefer jordana&#x27;s Matte bare lipstick,it&#x27;s creamier and doesn&#x27;t get on my teeth.</li>
            <li>I recommend Jordana matte bare</li>
            <li>It really is bare.</li>
            <li>Not what I expected, I have other wet n wild lipsticks that I instantly fell in love with</li>
            <li>I usually hate nude lipstick because they wash me out, but this is very pretty and warm.</li>
            <li>Wet N Wild&#x27;s Bare It All being onw of them, to try and find a natural looking matte lip color.</li>
            <li>The color just looked a little cheap, not exactly what I was expecting...</li>
            <li>I just recently started using Wet N Wild products and I am so pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>Nude liked it very much usually I used it like base for other lipsticks to get realy good looking mix lipstick</li>
            <li>I find that it&#x27;s not very long wearing, or maybe I just can&#x27;t tell because of the non-existent color.</li>
            <li>Who knew Wet N Wild had quality lipsticks!</li>
            <li>A decent color, but not worth going out of your way to get.</li>

            <li> The quality is amazing as well.</li>
            <li> but with a bit of lip gloss it is amazing.</li>
            <li> Nice color.  </li>
            <li> I honestly don&#x27;t understand why people like this lipstick.</li>
            <li> For those of you who need/like shine, FYI this product is very matte but wonderful nonetheless.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice nude color.</li>
            <li> nice nude.</li>
            <li> The color is nice but it \\&quot;feathers\\</li>
            <li> I was looking for this kind of lipstick for like a year  </li>
            <li> Nice nude lipstick for my skin tone.</li>
            <li> The claims are off but it is a nice color and no chemical smell or taste.</li>
            <li> I love the color! :)</li>
            <li> so I have to put some kind of gloss on top.  </li>
            <li> works nicely with a gloss over the top.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love, it!</li>
            <li> This color in particular is very gorgeous.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re very cheap and affordable.</li>
            <li> really is beautiful if you&#x27;re looking for a nice, natural looking nude.</li>
            <li> This is a super good deal and the color</li>
            <li> Its the PERFECT nude color for me, It last all day.</li>
            <li> I wear this more than my Mac lipstick.  </li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> I love the color, and it looks just as advertised.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to go by more of these.</li>
            <li> but this one is more of a brownish tan.</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t not look cute</li>
            <li> What more could you ask for from a lipstick?  </li>
            <li> Definitely recommend this lipstick - it is the best lipstick I have ever found.  </li>
            <li> Add for more words.</li>
            <li> I love having this with me at all times.</li>
            <li> I love that it is so inexpensive as well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> :) (you can buy a separate one just for this purpose if you&#x27;d like)&lt;br</li>
            <li> 34;buy one get one 50% off&amp;#34; or even better &amp;#34;buy one get one free&amp;#34; deal.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s solidly okay.</li>
            <li> Meh, it&#x27;s okay.  </li>
            <li> the price is even better.</li>
            <li> This is just ok in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I thought the color would be more pinkish-brown, but it&#x27;s the color of medium foundation.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the perfect amount to bring some solid color to my lips and it stays on all day.  </li>
            <li> Love this color, it&#x27;s so creamy and pigmented</li>
            <li> I like to apply a shiny nude gloss on top.</li>
            <li> I fell in love with the color</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s stunning.</li>
            <li> Still stunning color :)</li>
            <li> Love this color</li>
            <li> and i absolutely love this lipstick.</li>
            <li> will buy from this shop again! :)</li>
            <li> awesome n simple color</li>
            <li> I have an olive/yellow tone complexion and it looks more tan on my skin tone.</li>
            <li> is still my favorite nude lipstick, i choose this over my mac because it is just as pigmented but so inexpensive.</li>
            <li> Cute</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with this lipstick.</li>
            <li> I thought i would like the color more...</li>
            <li> , I love the color.&lt;br /&gt;is</li>
            <li> i love it</li>
            <li> i will buy more for sure</li>
            <li> The consistency is very similar and the coloring is perfect.</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li> Love the product, stays on well too.</li>
            <li> I love the color.</li>
            <li> The color is good and it stays on pretty well.</li>
            <li> Great color for someone not interested in wearing bright lipstick during the day.</li>
            <li> great color for brunette who want a natural look.  </li>
            <li> I was looking for an every day nude that would be good for work and wasn&#x27;t having much luck</li>
            <li> Great color, long lasting, great price!  </li>
            <li> However I loved the finish, it&#x27;s natural and more on the matte side</li>
            <li> so I wear it with a lip gloss and it works fine.</li>
            <li> It would be fine if you like the matte lipsticks</li>
            <li> is that me so lucky or is it okay for 7$ deal?</li>
            <li> , it goes on smoothly and feels fine on my lips.</li>
            <li> It is literally a light brown chocolate looking lipstick.</li>
            <li> It also has fantastic pigmentation.</li>
            <li> Excellent pigmentation, great nude color, like all Wet N Wild lipsticks is very drying</li>
            <li> Such a great dupe for Velvet Teddy by Mac.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I was too cheap to spend my cash on a lipstick by Mac...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely worth a try if you don&#x27;t feel like spending $16 or more for hi-end.</li>
            <li> Other than that, it applies very smooth and looks great.</li>
            <li> Just plain beautiful!</li>
            <li> Still a pretty color though!!</li>
            <li> This is my new favorite lipstick, i am planning on buying more colors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty tan more like a medium beige</li>
            <li> Great as an everyday lipstick definitely impressed with wet n wilds pigments.</li>
            <li> Retails for under $2, but I was willing to pay a higher price to make my own judgments.  </li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s super cheap.</li>
            <li> Put a light balm on and blot gently before applying the lipstick and it&#x27;ll last beautifully for hours.</li>
            <li> I am a fair skinned blonde girl in my mid/late twenties.  </li>
            <li> gave it five stars because, it came early and was packaged nicely.</li>
            <li> but the color still looks good and I&#x27;ve worn it almost daily.</li>
            <li> I do find that it wears off extremely fast (hour or so into wearing it), so be sure to bring it along wherever you go.</li>
            <li> I was really surprised how nice this lipstick is.</li>
            <li> So if your fair skin, it will definitely be on the brownish side on you.</li>
            <li> It is true to the word nude.</li>
            <li> I wear a W7 in L&#x27;oreal&#x27;s True Match, to give you reference.</li>
            <li> Love the colors but very drying.</li>
            <li> I wish it was more of a silver skin tone, will work best with people who wear gold I think, but I like it with a slight bit of pink on top.</li>
            <li> Lipstick is super drying on the lips.</li>
            <li> Just swipe and rub in quickly.</li>
            <li> arrived quickly and well packed.  </li>
            <li> The item arrived on time and packaged adequately.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t look great on dark skin.</li>
            <li> Color 5/5 - Very pretty nudy</li>
            <li> Beautiful color to my pale skin.</li>
            <li> color was good, but I thought it was dry,.</li>
            <li> Not very great, but it&#x27;s a very good price for what you get.</li>
            <li> Great everyday color.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 1/4 Mexican, so I get a nice golden tan, but with any way I do my eye makeup or</li>
            <li> The product itself is worth the price and is one of my favorites in nude shades.  </li>
            <li> but it is all worth it.  </li>
            <li> I add a clear lip gloss on top to give my lips the plumpest look.</li>
            <li> Worth it though.</li>
            <li> formula is very creamy consistency stays on fades alil during the day but other than that great lipstick..:DDD</li>
            <li> Very nice for an everyday look.</li>
            <li> Good neutral color and not brown nor pink!</li>
            <li> This adds just the right amount of matte color I need.</li>
            <li> Saw this on pinterest,color is a beautiful pinky nude and long lasting</li>
            <li> Before I would only use higher end cosmetics thinking the quality was far superior to any drug store cosmetic.</li>
            <li> The color is pretty though.</li>
            <li> I had much higher expectations with the color.</li>
            <li> Being an older woman I don&#x27;t care for bold colors.</li>
            <li> But when I first tried it on, it looked like I put chocolate on my lips.</li>
            <li> Really nice color; however it is a bit lighter than what I expected.</li>
            <li> Pretty color</li>
            <li> and it dries pretty matte.</li>
            <li> My package arrived today, exactly when they said it would</li>
            <li> Very pigmented!</li>
            <li> Love the color, wish I would have checked my local Walgreen&#x27;s before ordering on line.</li>
            <li> It was so cheap and the color is awesome (bare) for that look in lipstick.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a little bit dry, but just add a dab of lip balm for the matte look, or a dab of lip gloss for the shine look...</li>
            <li> The color is OK, but for my medium olive complexion it is a little light.  </li>
            <li> a great everyday color that looks natural</li>
            <li> Mixes nicely with my gloss or chapstick (to get rid of the classic, dry lipstick feeling.)</li>
            <li> Works well with a little lip gloss on top or if not it is a true matte color.  </li>
            <li> Dry, but love the color.  </li>
            <li> Like most matte colors it gets dry after a couple of hours.</li>
            <li> like how it&#x27;s easy to put on, it matches with my skin somewhat, and it&#x27;s just overall</li>
            <li> A nice brown nude, if not a little dry.  </li>
            <li> Probably will not be able to wear it during the winter when I struggle with very dry lips.</li>
            <li> They color is also very flattering.</li>
            <li> My skin color is kinda medium light brown with yellow undertones.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t like the color much.</li>
            <li> I LOVE wet n wild matte lipstick line!!!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t stay on too long, but it&#x27;s easy to apply.</li>
            <li> I really love these wet n wild lipsticks very much.</li>
            <li> This is a nice, creamy lipstick that actually feels moisturizing and stays on for a long time!</li>
            <li> the only difference is Jordana&#x27;s color is more skin tone like your lips and bare it all by Wet N Wild is lighter more of a nude.</li>
            <li> I have done this plenty of times and it gives me a pretty and natural &amp;#34;glow-from-within&amp;#34; appearance.</li>
            <li> I just wish it had a little more moisture in it.</li>
            <li> Gorgeous color, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I LOVED IT and definitely will try other colours!!!</li>
            <li> All in all, it&#x27;s worth the buy, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> All of the other Wet and Wild Shades in the black packaging are beautiful too!</li>
            <li> I use it with a light brown liner and I top it of with a pale pink gloss, talk about bring all the boys to the yard!</li>
            <li> Great everyday color for year round.</li>
            <li> This still looks pink on my lips, as I&#x27;m not super fair or super dark.</li>
            <li> It is long lasting and applies smooth with no streaks.</li>
            <li> I always find myself getting lipstick on the clear cap part of it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s probably a step or two darker than my natural lip coloring.</li>
            <li> I pair this with Natural lip liner by NYX.</li>
            <li> wild and will taste.</li>
            <li> Much cheaper at local drugstore.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Pigmentation 5/5 - Very, very verrryy pigmented&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;overall, very well round product.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what all the raving is about with this particular lipstick, but definitely isn&#x27;t all it&#x27;s cracked up to be.</li>
            <li> and i could finally find something that stays for a long time and has a very pure colour.</li>
            <li> The color is also very pretty, just maybe not an &#x27;everyday&#x27; natural look with my coloring (still gonna wear it 😁).</li>
            <li> I apply lip balm first, blot that off, apply some medium pink lip liner and then blot this color on.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a medium skin color and it was a little more brown that I expected</li>
            <li> Its a creamy formula and doesn&#x27;t dry up fast at all.</li>
            <li> Love the color only complaint is it doesn&#x27;t stay as well as my mac lipstick</li>
            <li> Not pink or even pinkish!</li>
            <li> It is very dry and settles in my lip lines too much.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m not really a big fan of this lipstick, but it&#x27;s perfectly fine if you can get past the struggle of putting it on.</li>
            <li> There was a little smudge at the top of the cap and the lipstick doesn&#x27;t roll up and down</li>
            <li> not pink or peach, just medium tan.</li>
            <li> I prefer jordana&#x27;s Matte bare lipstick,it&#x27;s creamier and doesn&#x27;t get on my teeth.</li>
            <li> I recommend Jordana matte bare</li>
            <li> It really is bare.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected, I have other wet n wild lipsticks that I instantly fell in love with</li>
            <li> I usually hate nude lipstick because they wash me out, but this is very pretty and warm.</li>
            <li> Wet N Wild&#x27;s Bare It All being onw of them, to try and find a natural looking matte lip color.</li>
            <li> The color just looked a little cheap, not exactly what I was expecting...</li>
            <li> I just recently started using Wet N Wild products and I am so pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> Nude liked it very much usually I used it like base for other lipsticks to get realy good looking mix lipstick</li>
            <li> I find that it&#x27;s not very long wearing, or maybe I just can&#x27;t tell because of the non-existent color.</li>
            <li> Who knew Wet N Wild had quality lipsticks!</li>
            <li> A decent color, but not worth going out of your way to get.</li>
            <li> I really, really like the color and the matte finish, but it does leave my lips a little dry.  </li>
            <li> It is not drying and it is fairly long lasting.</li>
            <li> I am giving this lipstick review 4 stars only because it could use some moisture, it feels a bit dry when applied.</li>
            <li> (Came with Wet &#x27;n&#x27; Wild Lipstick, Think Pink</li>
            <li> This color on my pale skin is just enough to completely my look, without looking like I&#x27;m wearing any lipstick at all.</li>
            <li> Not as expected - its not wet, its dry, not pleasantly nude but with reddish tint (exactly like at photo in description) and has strange tiny smell of plastic and musty wax &#x3D;\</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s matte, and a little darker than my natural lips.  </li>
            <li> am light-medium skin tone and this shade gives a little life to my lips- but still makes it look natural.</li>
            <li> Oh well, at least it wasn&#x27;t that much...</li>
            <li> Lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> This sounds strange, but just trust me and try it.</li>
            <li> Just for extra details, i am mexican and have a slight olive skin  tone.</li>
            <li> It does need to be reapplied occasionally,so it does not live up to the claim of a 4 hour long formula.  </li>
            <li> The lipstick was so dry that I could not even apply it without a struggle.  </li>
            <li> The lipstick itself is on the dry side and matt in finish.  </li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;m just not used to matte lipsticks, but I can&#x27;t stand having dry lips.</li>
            <li> dislike how dry it is, but with some lip balm</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s dry</li>
            <li> It is so dry that you have to layer it on</li>
            <li> I recently bought a few different matte lip colors,</li>
            <li> but I found lipstick to be very dry.  </li>
            <li> once you press hard enough for it to actually transfer color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> how dark/light my skin is, the pink undertones in this still show up for me.</li>
            <li> the fist time I went  buy a wet n</li>
            <li> It really thick and creamy and does last a long time.</li>
            <li> Not at all what the other reviews say..</li>
            <li> After spending tons of money on other nudes</li>
            <li> Just as i expected!</li>
            <li> A little dry, but has not feathered at all for me.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a little darker than advertised and it makes my lips really dry</li>
            <li> The product is a little on the dry side, so I apply lip gloss over it.</li>
            <li> it did have a hint of slight pink too.</li>
            <li> The formula is stiff and dry and requires a lot of pressure to get the pigment onto my lips.</li>
            <li> I think because I have dark skin</li>
            <li> I wear it with a dark brown lip liner to achieve an ombré lip.</li>
            <li> I like to use this as a matte base and layer a creamier lighter nude on top.  </li>
            <li> Other than that, the color is fabbb!</li>
            <li> It is matte and I usually apply some type of Chapstick before applying and don&#x27;t have a problem with dry lips as others have stated.</li>
            <li> im not super dark though.</li>
            <li> Also, I can pull it off with brown lipliner, and a slightly pinker gloss.</li>
            <li> This color can be difficult to find in drugstores that carry Wet N Wild</li>
            <li> I am generally skeptical of wet n wild products and this one is no exception.  </li>
            <li> A little matte</li>
            <li> I Like the color a little drying on the lips.</li>
            <li> It is a little bit drying though</li>
            <li> It also dried my lips out</li>
            <li> /&gt;Decent stay-time, few reapplication needed throughout the day.</li>
            <li> few tips:&lt;br /&gt;#1)</li>
            <li> but since I work in an air conditioned office I like to blot some balm on every few hours to stop it from drying up my lips</li>
            <li> dont waste money on mac</li>
            <li> It hasn&#x27;t dried my lips out at all</li>
            <li> It just had a bad scent, unlike the other wet and wild lipsticks I had.</li>
            <li> a little thick.</li>
            <li> :/</li>
            <li> I usually combine it with another color to get the effect I am looking for.</li>
            <li> Im very pale and a lot of times</li>
            <li> kinda hard to apply.</li>
            <li> Also, the application itself sucks.</li>
            <li> When it is on, it feels so delicate.</li>
            <li> &quot; very badly and can only be worn with a lot of another lip product such as, chapstick, lipgloss, or another moisturizing lipstick.</li>
            <li> It does not give off that ugly white nude color that you see alot.</li>
            <li> The shape also makes application difficult - it&#x27;s hard to keep it from going everywhere</li>
            <li> Not too dramatic but still noticeable.</li>
            <li> I rated it 3 stars because it&#x27;s difficult to apply.</li>
            <li> so I bought it and was not impressed.</li>
            <li> I noticed it gets on my teeth all the time,so disappointing.</li>
            <li> I was somewhat disappointed once I received this product.  </li>
            <li> Looking for a nude lip you wont be disappointed.</li>
            <li> #disappointed</li>
            <li> wear lip balm as a base before applying.</li>
            <li> The packaging is sorta annoying.</li>
            <li> I use a lil&#x27; Carmex or ChapStick as a base anyway.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Great dupe for Macs velvet teddy!</li>
            <li> Its the PERFECT nude color for me, It last all day. I&#x27;m happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> color was good, but I thought it was dry,. kinda hard to apply.</li>
            <li> Not the best- I was looking for nudes, but if you have nc45 skin and up, I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;d like it. Bet it works great on lighter skin tones, but for my brown face..nope! However, I do like to use this to lighten another lipstick or combine with another to make the perfect nude. Also, I can pull it off with brown lipliner, and a slightly pinker gloss.</li>
            <li> BEST NUDE COLOR EVER!!!! tip: wear lip balm as a base before applying.</li>
            <li> Nice color.  I use it as an overlay to a darker color.  It lasted all day</li>
            <li> Lipstick is super drying on the lips. You definitely have to put lip balm on before you apply it. Also, the application itself sucks. The color is pretty though.</li>
            <li> I love this lipstick! Great quality for the price.  I wear this more than my Mac lipstick.  Good neutral color and not brown nor pink! :) It&#x27;s great,</li>
            <li> I was looking a makeup video by Carli Bybel on Youtube and that&#x27;s were I got idea to buy this lipstick. I had much higher expectations with the color. Didn&#x27;t meet my expectation of the nude lipstick.</li>
            <li> Meh. Not so wet, not so wild.</li>
            <li> The lipstick was so dry that I could not even apply it without a struggle.  It also was not a flattering color on me.  Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Great everyday color.</li>
            <li> This nude color is just what I have been looking for. This is a nice, creamy lipstick that actually feels moisturizing and stays on for a long time! I love the color, and it looks just as advertised. I can&#x27;t wait to go by more of these. Don&#x27;t buy on Amazon though. Close to 6 bucks is a ripoff when you can go to Walmart and get it for $2 (what a steal!). This is a super good deal and the color really is beautiful if you&#x27;re looking for a nice, natural looking nude.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected, I have other wet n wild lipsticks that I instantly fell in love with but this one is more of a brownish tan. Not pink or even pinkish! I&#x27;m pretty tan more like a medium beige and it doesn&#x27;t not look cute so if you got a good tan going on I do not recommend. Still a pretty color though!!</li>
            <li> Love this lipstick, my go to!</li>
            <li> The color is OK, but for my medium olive complexion it is a little light.  The lipstick itself is on the dry side and matt in finish.  It also dried my lips out so I have to put some kind of gloss on top.  Not for me and I probably will not buy it again.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love, it! This is one of the items used by Carli Byble during one of her turtorials. I am so glade I purchased this lipstick, I will be buying again.</li>
            <li> Being an older woman I don&#x27;t care for bold colors. This adds just the right amount of matte color I need.</li>
            <li> Dry, but love the color.  I mix it with a lip gloss that makes it tolerable.  Probably will not be able to wear it during the winter when I struggle with very dry lips.</li>
            <li> Great dupe for Macs teddy!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t look great on dark skin. Also comes on chalky.</li>
            <li> Love it!  A little matte but it holds well and I love the color!</li>
            <li> a great everyday color that looks natural</li>
            <li> The formula and application is smooooooooth and never flaky after extended wear. Plus this is a universally flattering nude! It isn&#x27;t all chalky and ashy either. Just plain beautiful! I use it with a light brown liner and I top it of with a pale pink gloss, talk about bring all the boys to the yard!</li>
            <li> I recently bought a few different matte lip colors, Wet N Wild&#x27;s Bare It All being onw of them, to try and find a natural looking matte lip color. I like this lipstick well enough, it goes on smoothly and feels fine on my lips. The color is also very pretty, just maybe not an &#x27;everyday&#x27; natural look with my coloring (still gonna wear it 😁). It&#x27;s matte, and a little darker than my natural lips.  All in all, it&#x27;s worth the buy, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> This still looks pink on my lips, as I&#x27;m not super fair or super dark. I&#x27;m 1/4 Mexican, so I get a nice golden tan, but with any way I do my eye makeup or how dark/light my skin is, the pink undertones in this still show up for me.</li>
            <li> I honestly don&#x27;t understand why people like this lipstick. I bought this because the reviews led me to believe this was a great nude lipstick. But when I first tried it on, it looked like I put chocolate on my lips. It is literally a light brown chocolate looking lipstick. Not at all what the other reviews say.. Oh well, at least it wasn&#x27;t that much...</li>
            <li> This color can be difficult to find in drugstores that carry Wet N Wild so for that reason, I give it five stars!  The product itself is worth the price and is one of my favorites in nude shades.  For those of you who need/like shine, FYI this product is very matte but wonderful nonetheless.</li>
            <li> I like the color of this lipstick but it is so incredibly drying. Maybe I&#x27;m just not used to matte lipsticks, but I can&#x27;t stand having dry lips. I will not wear this lipstick without lip balm underneath. Other than that, it applies very smooth and looks great.</li>
            <li> Gorgeous color, a little goes a long way. This color on my pale skin is just enough to completely my look, without looking like I&#x27;m wearing any lipstick at all. It&#x27;s probably a step or two darker than my natural lip coloring. Great for every-day look.&lt;br /&gt;Decent stay-time, few reapplication needed throughout the day. Mixes nicely with my gloss or chapstick (to get rid of the classic, dry lipstick feeling.) Very pleased I found this! Who knew Wet N Wild had quality lipsticks! Definitely try this out.</li>
            <li> Great color, long lasting, great price!  I can add a touch of gloss and not lose the color or duration of the application.  What more could you ask for from a lipstick?  Definitely recommend this lipstick - it is the best lipstick I have ever found.  I will be buying it again and again.</li>
            <li> Great everyday color for year round. Great mixing color.</li>
            <li> Love the color only complaint is it doesn&#x27;t stay as well as my mac lipstick</li>
            <li> Nude liked it very much usually I used it like base for other lipsticks to get realy good looking mix lipstick</li>
            <li> Really nice color; however it is a bit lighter than what I expected.</li>
            <li> Great color. Lasts a long time. It is definitely a matte finish.  Great for the price. Add for more words.</li>
            <li> My FAVORITE lipstick (and I have plenty!). This is the perfect nude/bare lipstick for me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am light-medium skin tone and this shade gives a little life to my lips- but still makes it look natural. I love having this with me at all times. It is not drying and it is fairly long lasting. It also has fantastic pigmentation. I love that it is so inexpensive as well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few tips:&lt;br /&gt;#1) Don&#x27;t have a blush on you? Use this as a cream blush! Just swipe and rub in quickly. The color is GORGEOUS on the cheeks. I have done this plenty of times and it gives me a pretty and natural &amp;#34;glow-from-within&amp;#34; appearance. This sounds strange, but just trust me and try it. :) (you can buy a separate one just for this purpose if you&#x27;d like)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;#2) They sell for only $1.99 at drugstores- you can often find a &amp;#34;buy one get one 50% off&amp;#34; or even better &amp;#34;buy one get one free&amp;#34; deal. All of the other Wet and Wild Shades in the black packaging are beautiful too!</li>
            <li> Pretty color but I found lipstick to be very dry.  I would not buy again</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s solidly okay. The color is good and it stays on pretty well. I rated it 3 stars because it&#x27;s difficult to apply. The formula is stiff and dry and requires a lot of pressure to get the pigment onto my lips. The shape also makes application difficult - it&#x27;s hard to keep it from going everywhere once you press hard enough for it to actually transfer color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m not really a big fan of this lipstick, but it&#x27;s perfectly fine if you can get past the struggle of putting it on.</li>
            <li> I ordered this to try since I&#x27;ve seen it all over Pinterest.  Meh, it&#x27;s okay.  I wouldn&#x27;t order it again though.</li>
            <li> I was somewhat disappointed once I received this product.  It is very dry and settles in my lip lines too much.  Color is great - I just wish it had a little more moisture in it.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t the color I&#x27;d anticipated</li>
            <li> Great choice n the price is even better. Looking for a nude lip you wont be disappointed. Trust me !</li>
            <li> This is just ok in my opinion. I thought the color would be more pinkish-brown, but it&#x27;s the color of medium foundation. Maybe I picked up a tube that was incorrectly labeled? I find that it&#x27;s not very long wearing, or maybe I just can&#x27;t tell because of the non-existent color.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like it I think because I have dark skin</li>
            <li> My favorite!  I am a fair skinned blonde girl in my mid/late twenties.  In 15 years of using make up this is one of the only truly matte lip colors I have found. I am generally skeptical of wet n wild products and this one is no exception.  I was hesitant but purchased it anyway because of the affordable price.  I apply lip balm first, blot that off, apply some medium pink lip liner and then blot this color on.  It&#x27;s the perfect amount to bring some solid color to my lips and it stays on all day.  Works well with a little lip gloss on top or if not it is a true matte color.  Mine stays on all day with no help but since I work in an air conditioned office I like to blot some balm on every few hours to stop it from drying up my lips but it is all worth it.  I wouldn&#x27;t trade this find.  Even bought it for my younger sis in a different shade! Love!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also arrived quickly and well packed.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> I just recently started using Wet N Wild products and I am so pleasantly surprised. Before I would only use higher end cosmetics thinking the quality was far superior to any drug store cosmetic. I was looking for an every day nude that would be good for work and wasn&#x27;t having much luck so I thought why not try it for only $1.99. Now it has become my staple lipstick, it goes on easy, has great staying power and its just a great color. If you haven&#x27;t tried Wet N Wild lipsticks ( the $.99 ones aren&#x27;t quite as good of quality as the $1.99) then you definitely should!</li>
            <li> Love this color, it&#x27;s so creamy and pigmented and it dries pretty matte. So great for the price!</li>
            <li> This is THE perfect dupe for Velvet Teddy by MAC. I pair this with Natural lip liner by NYX.</li>
            <li> great product. would totally recommend~~~~ same quality as mac lipstick!... dont waste money on mac this is the best... t</li>
            <li> I purchased this after seeing it on Pinterest. It&#x27;s a nice nude color. It doesn&#x27;t stay on too long, but it&#x27;s easy to apply. I like to apply a shiny nude gloss on top.</li>
            <li> I purchased this because I saw it was close to Kylie Jenner&#x27;s signature look lipstick. I fell in love with the color it&#x27;s stunning. Like most matte colors it gets dry after a couple of hours. Still stunning color :)</li>
            <li> Love this color it is amazing. It is also great quality</li>
            <li> The lipstick was rather chalky &amp; unflattering. I don&#x27;t know what all the raving is about with this particular lipstick, but definitely isn&#x27;t all it&#x27;s cracked up to be.</li>
            <li> My package arrived today, exactly when they said it would and i absolutely love this lipstick. The price is amazing and so is this product. It hasn&#x27;t dried my lips out at all (I put on some exfoliating lip scub before applying the lipstick.) and it has lasted quite a while. They color is also very flattering. Not too dramatic but still noticeable. Very nice for an everyday look.</li>
            <li> 5 STARS:&lt;br /&gt;I gave it five stars because, it came early and was packaged nicely. (Came with Wet &#x27;n&#x27; Wild Lipstick, Think Pink 901B)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Liked:&lt;br /&gt;I like how it&#x27;s easy to put on, it matches with my skin somewhat, and it&#x27;s just overall pretty!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dislike:&lt;br /&gt;I dislike how dry it is, but with some lip balm it&#x27;s perfect!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommend:&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to my sister and mom!&lt;br /&gt;I will buy from this shop again! :)</li>
            <li> Excellent pigmentation, great nude color, like all Wet N Wild lipsticks is very drying</li>
            <li> I usually hate nude lipstick because they wash me out, but this is very pretty and warm. I&#x27;m N3 in L&#x27;Oréal Lumi foundation. Put a light balm on and blot gently before applying the lipstick and it&#x27;ll last beautifully for hours.</li>
            <li> Perfect kylie jenner lipstick&lt;br /&gt;Love the color and it stays on</li>
            <li> Color 5/5 - Very pretty nudy color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pigmentation 5/5 - Very, very verrryy pigmented&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;overall, very well round product. formula is very creamy consistency stays on fades alil during the day but other than that great lipstick..:DDD</li>
            <li> I really love these wet n wild lipsticks very much. They&#x27;re very cheap and affordable. The packaging is sorta annoying. I always find myself getting lipstick on the clear cap part of it. This color in particular is very gorgeous. My skin color is kinda medium light brown with yellow undertones. And when I put it on sometimes it shows up sorta orange. It changes with the lighting though. Just thought I&#x27;d let you know.</li>
            <li> Great color , love the brand , great price from this vendor,, ships quick would buy fromt hem again, leslie</li>
            <li> a little thick. works nicely with a gloss over the top. nice nude. not pink or peach, just medium tan.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d heard a lot of great things about this lipstick so I bought it and was not impressed. The color is nice but it \\&quot;feathers\\&quot; very badly and can only be worn with a lot of another lip product such as, chapstick, lipgloss, or another moisturizing lipstick. It&#x27;s inexpensive so it is worth the try but don&#x27;t expect it to be the perfect nude lipstick.</li>
            <li> awesome n simple color</li>
            <li> The nude i was looking for! After spending tons of money on other nudes</li>
            <li> Great pigmented lipstick. A little dry, but has not feathered at all for me. I&#x27;m a medium skin color and it was a little more brown that I expected (I think it would look awesome on someone really tan!) but the color still looks good and I&#x27;ve worn it almost daily. A good product!</li>
            <li> Ordered this lipstick because I wanted a nude lipstick that I could just apply and go and this was the perfect lipstick for that!!! I LOVE wet n wild matte lipstick line!!!</li>
            <li> Just as i expected! I love the color! :)</li>
            <li> I was looking for this kind of lipstick for like a year  and i could finally find something that stays for a long time and has a very pure colour. I LOVED IT and definitely will try other colours!!!</li>
            <li> Such a great dupe for Velvet Teddy by Mac. I bought this because I was too cheap to spend my cash on a lipstick by Mac... This color is so beautiful, and goes on smoothly. It isn&#x27;t matte, but it isn&#x27;t shiny. I add a clear lip gloss on top to give my lips the plumpest look. I do find that it wears off extremely fast (hour or so into wearing it), so be sure to bring it along wherever you go. When it is on, it feels so delicate. If I were to touch my lips, I&#x27;d feel like it would smear all over the place... Worth it though. Beautiful color to my pale skin.</li>
            <li> Beautiful color! I am olive toned and this color looks great on me. Great as an everyday lipstick definitely impressed with wet n wilds pigments. It is matte and I usually apply some type of Chapstick before applying and don&#x27;t have a problem with dry lips as others have stated.</li>
            <li> I was really surprised how nice this lipstick is. It really thick and creamy and does last a long time. I have an olive/yellow tone complexion and it looks more tan on my skin tone. So if your fair skin, it will definitely be on the brownish side on you. It does not give off that ugly white nude color that you see alot. It is true to the word nude. This is my new favorite lipstick, i am planning on buying more colors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update&lt;br /&gt;This is still my favorite nude lipstick, i choose this over my mac because it is just as pigmented but so inexpensive.</li>
            <li> Wonderful thank you very much</li>
            <li> beautiful nude lipstick for the darker skin tone and lips ladies. I have  more brown colored lips, so this was the perfect nude. it did have a hint of slight pink too. i got shade &amp;#34;bare it all&amp;#34;. Just for extra details, i am mexican and have a slight olive skin  tone. im not super dark though.</li>
            <li> Nice nude lipstick for my skin tone. I wear it with a dark brown lip liner to achieve an ombré lip. Cute</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with this lipstick. Im very pale and a lot of times, colors like this just dont look good. This one however looks amazing. The quality is amazing as well. Its a creamy formula and doesn&#x27;t dry up fast at all. Over all this is one of the best lipsticks I own.</li>
            <li> when a woman of color is looking for lipstick, it doesnt only depend on skin tone, it also depends on the amount of pigment in the lips. My lips have some pigment, so this didnt work for me. It matched my skin. I like the texture, but the color looked too ashy on my lips.&lt;br /&gt;(My skintone is like Whitney Houston.) #disappointed</li>
            <li> I love this color!  It&#x27;s the perfect nude!  It goes on nicely, lasts, and looks great!  I would definitely buy this again!</li>
            <li> I Like the color a little drying on the lips.</li>
            <li> Not very great, but it&#x27;s a very good price for what you get. The color just looked a little cheap, not exactly what I was expecting...</li>
            <li> I thought i would like the color more... it&#x27;s a little darker than advertised and it makes my lips really dry</li>
            <li> I ordered and received this product on time!  Nice to have that happen!  It was so cheap and the color is awesome (bare) for that look in lipstick.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a little bit dry, but just add a dab of lip balm for the matte look, or a dab of lip gloss for the shine look...either way you will be pleased!</li>
            <li> great color for brunette who want a natural look.  The product is a little on the dry side, so I apply lip gloss over it.</li>
            <li> Not as expected - its not wet, its dry, not pleasantly nude but with reddish tint (exactly like at photo in description) and has strange tiny smell of plastic and musty wax &#x3D;\ is that me so lucky or is it okay for 7$ deal? That&#x27;s all.</li>
            <li> I loved it. It just had a bad scent, unlike the other wet and wild lipsticks I had. However I loved the finish, it&#x27;s natural and more on the matte side</li>
            <li> Perfect color awesome look</li>
            <li> IN LooooooooVeeeee with this lipstick 😍😍😍❤️❤️❤️</li>
            <li> I really, really like the color and the matte finish, but it does leave my lips a little dry.  :/</li>
            <li> Great color.  Need a gloss to go over it, but it&#x27;s my go-to lipstick.</li>
            <li> Beautiful lip color. The formula is great. It is long lasting and applies smooth with no streaks. The color is awesome. It works best on exfoliated lips. Just as good as a lipstick three times it&#x27;s cost.</li>
            <li> I like this lipstick but I don&#x27;t like the color much. It is not one of the best colors for my skin tone. I usually combine it with another color to get the effect I am looking for.</li>
            <li> Great color for someone not interested in wearing bright lipstick during the day. Great price and delivers what it promises.</li>
            <li> This color is all the rage on Pinterest, so of course it is sold out at every drugstore in the area.  Retails for under $2, but I was willing to pay a higher price to make my own judgments.  A nice brown nude, if not a little dry.  I use a lil&#x27; Carmex or ChapStick as a base anyway.  I like to use this as a matte base and layer a creamier lighter nude on top.  A decent color, but not worth going out of your way to get.</li>
            <li> Lipstick is a very cheap but it works great, I love the color.&lt;br /&gt;is the fist time I went  buy a wet n wild and will taste.</li>
            <li> I am giving this lipstick review 4 stars only because it could use some moisture, it feels a bit dry when applied. Other than that, the color is fabbb!</li>
            <li> Very pigmented! Much cheaper at local drugstore.</li>
            <li> Saw this on pinterest,color is a beautiful pinky nude and long lasting but it&#x27;s dry so I wear it with a lip gloss and it works fine. It would be fine if you like the matte lipsticks but I don&#x27;t .</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t like the lipstick</li>
            <li> Good lipstick to have!</li>
            <li> and this is the perfect nude!!!! i cant find a more perfect nude than this.. mac have one but it looks like its just a gloss... i love it i will buy more for sure</li>
            <li> I bought this for $2.29 at Wallgreens. I remember when these lipsticks were.99 cents,lol. It is so dry that you have to layer it on and it does bleed and smudge,it also fades when i drink water. It does need to be reapplied occasionally,so it does not live up to the claim of a 4 hour long formula.  I noticed it gets on my teeth all the time,so disappointing. I prefer jordana&#x27;s Matte bare lipstick,it&#x27;s creamier and doesn&#x27;t get on my teeth. The claims are off but it is a nice color and no chemical smell or taste. I also had no irritation with this lipstick. It&#x27;s definitely worth a try if you don&#x27;t feel like spending $16 or more for hi-end. I recommend Jordana matte bare the only difference is Jordana&#x27;s color is more skin tone like your lips and bare it all by Wet N Wild is lighter more of a nude.</li>
            <li> This is hands-down the best dupe for MAC&#x27;s &amp;#34;Velvet Teddy&amp;#34; anywhere. And it&#x27;s super cheap. The consistency is very similar and the coloring is perfect. I wear a W7 in L&#x27;oreal&#x27;s True Match, to give you reference. It&#x27;s a universally complementary color.</li>
            <li> Beautiful color. Great matte finish.</li>
            <li> I love it! Perfect color for any occasion!</li>
            <li> Love the color, wish I would have checked my local Walgreen&#x27;s before ordering on line. I&#x27;ll be buying this brand from now on. The item arrived on time and packaged adequately. There was a little smudge at the top of the cap and the lipstick doesn&#x27;t roll up and down well but that&#x27;s ok, I&#x27;ve already bought the same color at Walgreen&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Love the product, stays on well too. I wish it was more of a silver skin tone, will work best with people who wear gold I think, but I like it with a slight bit of pink on top.</li>
            <li> I love the color. It really is bare.</li>
            <li> Love the colors but very drying.</li>
            <li> I just feel sexy with this stuff on my lips, great product. It is a little bit drying though but with a bit of lip gloss it is amazing.</li>
