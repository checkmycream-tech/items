            <li>Product authentic and great results!!!</li>
            <li>Basically, it gives me good hair days</li>
            <li>I used about 3/4 of the bottle, and I applied it fairly liberally.</li>
            <li>This Just makes my hair look soo good for months.</li>
            <li>/&gt;During the 24 hours you leave the product on your hair, your hair may not look its greatest, so it&#x27;s a good idea to pick a day when you don&#x27;t have anything special planned.  </li>
            <li>LOVE IT!  </li>
            <li>This is a great product, it really helps keep frizz and fly aways at bay.</li>
            <li>For me, when I have it on my hair, it kind of looks like I haven&#x27;t washed my hair in a couple of days.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Amazing &amp; totally worth the price!!!</li>
            <li>Very easy to use and yields</li>
            <li>I found it very easy to apply the product myself.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very fine, but I have a lot of hair.  </li>
            <li>Very good product Highly recommended</li>
            <li>It was great just what I was looking for will order it again when I need it very very soon</li>
            <li>I used it on my granddaughter and after  her first shampoo she call to tell me how great her hair feels.</li>
            <li>I have no damage to my hair and it leaves it very smooth and manageable.</li>
            <li>Perfect for short hairs cuts that get cut often.</li>
            <li>I did this for $15 when you consider that you get more than one treatment from it.</li>
            <li>Its okay because the product change and now is liquid no creamy.</li>
            <li>You will not find a better product than this to straighten without damage to your hair.</li>
            <li>Have tried them all over many years and am happier with my hair than I have ever been.</li>
            <li>However, I want the option to still be able to wear my hair curly (by airdrying) just without the frizz.</li>
            <li>I love the way this produce straightens and add shine to my hair.  </li>
            <li>My hair never looked better.</li>
            <li>I love the results.  </li>
            <li>Be sure to protect your scalp before applying.</li>
            <li>most days.&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;ve never done keratin before and aren&#x27;t sure how you&#x27;ll like it, you might want to try that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you have shorter hair, you may be able to get 2 applications out of this bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure Coppola makes one</li>
            <li>they are just sitting on the hair and are more noticeable.  </li>
            <li>nothing more to say</li>
            <li>I love this formula because I can not sit still for hours having a treatment done.</li>
            <li>Love this product...</li>
            <li>Good product, very close to the Keratin therapy treatment.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>I received the product I ordered very quickly</li>
            <li>The comparable treatment in the salon is easily $150.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use</li>
            <li>It has a strong smell and makes my eyes water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Bottle looks fine.</li>
            <li>I did not want to rate the product because I did not read the fine print</li>
            <li>Applied it last week and my hair came out great.  </li>
            <li>Just completed the keratin treatment and my hair looks fabulous.  </li>
            <li>I have had better luck with a \\&quot;hard-water\\&quot; shampoo and it has more intense clarifying results with products removal.</li>
            <li>This washes out after 5 or 6 shampoos, but it&#x27;s great before a special event when you want your hair to look extra smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li>Just make sure you have a quality flat iron that will get nice an hot - but has smooth plates</li>
            <li>I did it at home with help of my friend and it worked pretty fine.</li>
            <li>Have used this product several times and LOVE it!  </li>
            <li>Well worth the cost and time.</li>
            <li>Right away we noticed the shine.</li>
            <li>Just received this product yesterday and used it right away.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a much cheaper way to get the Kartin and not pay for the labor!</li>
            <li>There is a trick to it ;)</li>
            <li>This is the first time I have used this product.</li>
            <li>and it did exactly what it said-</li>
            <li>Product is exactly what it claims to be.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always used Coppola products and liked them, but there are a ton of other shampoos made for keratin treated hair.  </li>
            <li>pretty much all of the curl- just not as silky as the non-express version.</li>
            <li>I only used last night so far hair looks great</li>
            <li>Although the product isn&#x27;t as strong as the 3-4 month Keratin, it definitely fights the frizz.</li>
            <li>This seems to be the real deal.  </li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>I have VERY curly frizzy hair.</li>
            <li>Like it so much that when it was time to have my hair redone</li>
            <li>Look, smell, and consistency of product absolutely authentic--same as in salon.</li>
            <li>Worked very well for me&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li>I put on my hair and combed through with a wide tooth comb making sure hair was covered from the roots out.  </li>
            <li>of the pluses of keratin is that, because it coats the hair shaft, your hair dries much faster.  </li>
            <li>, this is so much easlier to use.</li>
            <li>and it was packed very well.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many different keratin products and this one is by far my fave.</li>
            <li>So, for me, when I&#x27;ve had a keratin treatment I have to wash my hair more often (every other day,</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit time consuming but not hard, and it&#x27;s a fraction of the price of having it done at a salon!</li>
            <li>My dry, brittle, over-processed hair is now soft, shiny and smooth!  </li>
            <li>I get at least three treatments from this size bottle and am very pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li>Around $12, and there is more than half of the bottle left.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After shampooing well with the above, I used the \\&quot;full strength\\&quot; product \\&quot;Keratin Complex Smoothing Treatment\\&quot;; and as always, am thrilled with the results.</li>
            <li>This treatment makes styling my hair MUCH easier, it makes my wet hair dry faster, and it makes my hair look pretty good even if I don&#x27;t blow dry it.</li>
            <li>The nest morning some of the product had absorbed into the hair which was starting to shine.  </li>
            <li>2 oz is more than enough for long hair (40 cm).</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit time consuming but not hard, and it&#x27;s a fraction of the price of having it done at a salon!is at home.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li>I have used Coppola Express Blow Out in the past and have been pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li>This time, I looked for Coppola because I know it&#x27;s the exact product my stylist uses for the keratin treatments I&#x27;ve been getting in a salon for several years.&lt;br</li>
            <li>product that I did the entire process on a small section of hair first, to make sure I would like the results.  </li>
            <li>I used ionic hot rollers imstead of a flat iron because I like waves, not flat to my head straight hair.  </li>
            <li>Really doesn&#x27;t take too much effort, so not really a problem when it&#x27;s time to do it again.</li>
            <li>It took a bit of time to do as I have natural hair and am not use to all the steps one has to do with this product.  </li>
            <li>Completely sealed and legit.</li>
            <li>Although it costs more, it requires the same steps (wash, apply, blow- dry and flat iron), makes hair WAY silkier and last 3-5 months.</li>
            <li>After applying this and receiving the results that were expected, I noticed that my hair was back to its original shape in only 2 weeks.</li>
            <li>When I ordered it this time, I received an email from the seller saying that the packaging was different now, sending me a picture of the new bottle, and asking me if I still wanted it.  </li>
            <li>The difference between the 2 is for the 3-5 month treatment you MUST blow dry gently after you wash your hair with the clarifying shampoo then apply the treatment.</li>
            <li>so do it in a VERY WELL ventilated room with a fan and open windows, if possible.</li>
            <li>My hair stays frizz free for at least three months.</li>
            <li>Should only be processed by professional Hair Artist.</li>
            <li>the first week after putting it on (both at home and previously in a salon)</li>
            <li>I have regularly used the Keratin Complex Smoothing Treatment; or what I consider the full strength product that lasts 3-4 months.</li>
            <li>The bottle says not to wash your hair for at least 8 hours, but my salon has always told me not to wash it for 24 hours, so I left it on for a full day.  </li>

            <li> Prior to buying, I asked seller for their guarantee of authenticity of the product and they replied quickly that they would stand behind their products.</li>
            <li> and it last a long time.</li>
            <li> I do not know now how long it will last though.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even use a flat iron, I just blow-out!  </li>
            <li> You will have soft, silky and manageable hair in less time.</li>
            <li> process of using it is, basically, that you wash your hair with a clarifying shampoo, blow it almost dry, apply this product in sections to your hair, then blow dry your hair again, and then flat iron it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 34yrs old with bad, frizzy, fine hair.</li>
            <li> would recommend this product to anyone who has dry, frizzy hair.  </li>
            <li> I spray a root lifter onto my wet hair before blowing it dry, and that helps.  </li>
            <li> my hair can look a little flat.</li>
            <li> I have long, color-treated hair that has a slight wave and that tends to get frizzy and unkempt looking.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way</li>
            <li> I should have known when I was having the treatment done and the fumes did not make my eyes water like the other product did.  </li>
            <li> I ordered this after seeing a show on how to use and, I have seen other products like this Howevee</li>
            <li> No more hundreds of dollars at salons for a simple job.</li>
            <li> I hope it lasts a few shampoos before I have to re-apply, even though the process didn&#x27;t take very long.</li>
            <li> Cuts blow dry time in half!</li>
            <li> With the Express you apply treatment to wet towel dried hair.</li>
            <li> Made my hair a stringy mess.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this product because I got the non-express version a few months ago done in a salon</li>
            <li> ,I blow dried</li>
            <li> Less blow-drying time!  </li>
            <li> A few years ago, I used a product at home that said it was a keratin treatment but was really just a hair straightener, and it was disastrous.  </li>
            <li> Having the treatment done with this product was a waste of both time and money!</li>
            <li> and I am not sure what it is the product for.</li>
            <li> was so nervous because of my past experience with a home use &amp;#34;keratin&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> have longish (past my shoulders) hair.  </li>
            <li> So I was not thrilled about the results from the clarifying shampoo as well.</li>
            <li> I was apprehensive about buying this type of product online, to say the least.  </li>
            <li> I have thick curls and they have been tamed since I applied the express treatment.</li>
            <li> I have thick and frizzy hair.  </li>
            <li> But I grew tired of spending $300+ per month for keratin and color services and decided to tackle it myself.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I had a friend apply this product.  It took us about an hour.  It turned out great!  No need to go to a salon and pay $150!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll order it again, only used 1/2 the bottle!</li>
            <li> I received two bottles of this and both were oxidized and expired. They did not work well on several people.</li>
            <li> This is a great product, it really helps keep frizz and fly aways at bay. Perfect for short hairs cuts that get cut often.</li>
            <li> This seems to be the real deal.  Applied it last week and my hair came out great.  It took a bit of time to do as I have natural hair and am not use to all the steps one has to do with this product.  My hairdresser charges $155.  I did this for $15 when you consider that you get more than one treatment from it. I like this bc I can keep my curls, relax them a bit and protect it with the keratin.&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a much cheaper way to get the Kartin and not pay for the labor! Worked just like at the salon! Thanks</li>
            <li> Love this product!! Should only be processed by professional Hair Artist. There is a trick to it ;)</li>
            <li> Its okay because the product change and now is liquid no creamy.</li>
            <li> I would not recommend this product.  I have used Coppola Express Blow Out in the past and have been pleased with the results.  When I ordered it this time, I received an email from the seller saying that the packaging was different now, sending me a picture of the new bottle, and asking me if I still wanted it.  I asked them if it was the same stuff and they said that Coppola was no longer affiliated but it was the same.  Well, they sent me the product  and it is NOT the same.  I should have known when I was having the treatment done and the fumes did not make my eyes water like the other product did.  Having the treatment done with this product was a waste of both time and money!</li>
            <li> Works great for my clients !</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have used this product. I have regularly used the Keratin Complex Smoothing Treatment; or what I consider the full strength product that lasts 3-4 months. After applying this and receiving the results that were expected, I noticed that my hair was back to its original shape in only 2 weeks. I only washed it every 3rd day with a keratin-safe shampoo. Upon removing with the Coppola Clarifying shampoo, my hair felt \\&quot;gummy\\&quot; and coated with something. So I was not thrilled about the results from the clarifying shampoo as well. I have had better luck with a \\&quot;hard-water\\&quot; shampoo and it has more intense clarifying results with products removal. After shampooing well with the above, I used the \\&quot;full strength\\&quot; product \\&quot;Keratin Complex Smoothing Treatment\\&quot;; and as always, am thrilled with the results. You will not find a better product than this to straighten without damage to your hair. Have tried them all over many years and am happier with my hair than I have ever been.</li>
            <li> My dry, brittle, over-processed hair is now soft, shiny and smooth!  I used ionic hot rollers imstead of a flat iron because I like waves, not flat to my head straight hair.  I hope it lasts a few shampoos before I have to re-apply, even though the process didn&#x27;t take very long.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product because I got the non-express version a few months ago done in a salon and it did exactly what it said- it straighted my hair and reduced all frizz. However, I want the option to still be able to wear my hair curly (by airdrying) just without the frizz. However, this is not the product for that and I am not sure what it is the product for. Basically, it reduced the frizz in my hair but also pretty much all of the curl- just not as silky as the non-express version. In my option, just go with the more expensive non-express version. Although it costs more, it requires the same steps (wash, apply, blow- dry and flat iron), makes hair WAY silkier and last 3-5 months. This product didnt make my hair silky, just reduced the frizz and I can already tell it  probably wont last the entire 30 days.</li>
            <li> I have VERY curly frizzy hair. I do the 3-5 month keratin treatment about every 6 months or so. In Between I use the express blow-out which makes the 3-5 month treatment last longer. The difference between the 2 is for the 3-5 month treatment you MUST blow dry gently after you wash your hair with the clarifying shampoo then apply the treatment. With the Express you apply treatment to wet towel dried hair.</li>
            <li> I love the way this produce straightens and add shine to my hair.  Like it so much that when it was time to have my hair redone I did not hesitate to purchase this produce again.</li>
            <li> Very good product Highly recommended</li>
            <li> I only used last night so far hair looks great but I will let u know after i wash it and go in the night air to see if it does not frizz.</li>
            <li> I can recommend this seller and product 110%.  I was apprehensive about buying this type of product online, to say the least.  But I grew tired of spending $300+ per month for keratin and color services and decided to tackle it myself.  Prior to buying, I asked seller for their guarantee of authenticity of the product and they replied quickly that they would stand behind their products. Look, smell, and consistency of product absolutely authentic--same as in salon. Just completed the keratin treatment and my hair looks fabulous.  Results same as salon.  Product authentic and great results!!!</li>
            <li> Worked very well for me&lt;br /&gt;Love that you only have to wait 8 hours to wash again&lt;br /&gt;Great product!</li>
            <li> I measured out 2 oz.  I put on my hair and combed through with a wide tooth comb making sure hair was covered from the roots out.  I covered my head with a plastic bag and left 30 min ,I blow dried the w I wear my hair.  I then  straightened with the straightened with the hair straightener iron.  The nest morning some of the product had absorbed into the hair which was starting to shine.  My hair never looked better.</li>
            <li> Life. Changing.  Have used this product several times and LOVE it!  Very easy to use and yields great results.  Really doesn&#x27;t take too much effort, so not really a problem when it&#x27;s time to do it again. I&#x27;ve tried many different keratin products and this one is by far my fave. Just make sure you have a quality flat iron that will get nice an hot - but has smooth plates so you don&#x27;t tug/snap your hair. Only concern is that it does sting my eyes during the flat ironing stage quite a bit - so do it in a VERY WELL ventilated room with a fan and open windows, if possible.</li>
            <li> Amazing &amp; totally worth the price!!!</li>
            <li> I actually has a friend do this treatment to me and then I in turn did it on my daughter.  I love the results.  My hair is fighting back against the humid summer weather and I couldn&#x27;t be happier.  I don&#x27;t even use a flat iron, I just blow-out!  LOVE IT!  Definitely going to order this again.</li>
            <li> This washes out after 5 or 6 shampoos, but it&#x27;s great before a special event when you want your hair to look extra smooth and shiny. A little goes a long way so I expect to get about 7 uses out of the 4 oz bottle. Be sure to protect your scalp before applying.</li>
            <li> Product is exactly what it claims to be. My hair was damaged from relaxing now it has shine and bounce again</li>
            <li> A few years ago, I used a product at home that said it was a keratin treatment but was really just a hair straightener, and it was disastrous.  Made my hair a stringy mess.  This time, I looked for Coppola because I know it&#x27;s the exact product my stylist uses for the keratin treatments I&#x27;ve been getting in a salon for several years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it to tame frizz, rather than to make my hair pin straight.  I have long, color-treated hair that has a slight wave and that tends to get frizzy and unkempt looking. This treatment makes styling my hair MUCH easier, it makes my wet hair dry faster, and it makes my hair look pretty good even if I don&#x27;t blow dry it. Basically, it gives me good hair days most days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The process of using it is, basically, that you wash your hair with a clarifying shampoo, blow it almost dry, apply this product in sections to your hair, then blow dry your hair again, and then flat iron it.  For me, the entire process took about 90 minutes.  The bottle says not to wash your hair for at least 8 hours, but my salon has always told me not to wash it for 24 hours, so I left it on for a full day.  That was 5 weeks ago and my hair still looks great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Things to keep in mind:&lt;br /&gt;I was so nervous because of my past experience with a home use &amp;#34;keratin&amp;#34; product that I did the entire process on a small section of hair first, to make sure I would like the results.  If you&#x27;ve never done keratin before and aren&#x27;t sure how you&#x27;ll like it, you might want to try that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle doesn&#x27;t say this, but my stylist has always told me that during the 24 hours the product is on my hair, I shouldn&#x27;t put it into a ponytail or clip or bind it in any way, or I might wind up with indentation marks on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While putting it on you might want to be in a well ventilated area.  It has a strong smell and makes my eyes water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;ll need a clarifying shampoo, not just a regular shampoo for before you apply the product.  I bought Coppola&#x27;s here and it wasn&#x27;t very expensive. Around $12, and there is more than half of the bottle left.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;ll need a brush to apply it with.  Again, I bought one here for about $3.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have longish (past my shoulders) hair.  It&#x27;s very fine, but I have a lot of hair.  I used about 3/4 of the bottle, and I applied it fairly liberally. If you have shorter hair, you may be able to get 2 applications out of this bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;During the 24 hours you leave the product on your hair, your hair may not look its greatest, so it&#x27;s a good idea to pick a day when you don&#x27;t have anything special planned.  For me, when I have it on my hair, it kind of looks like I haven&#x27;t washed my hair in a couple of days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle says to use a Coppola straightening iron, set at 450 degrees.  I used a Chi straightening iron that only goes up to 400 degrees and it was fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Afterwards, you have to use a shampoo and conditioner that&#x27;s made for keratin treated hair.  I&#x27;ve always used Coppola products and liked them, but there are a ton of other shampoos made for keratin treated hair.  The key is to use one that doesn&#x27;t contain sulfates, because sulfates will pull the keratin out of your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the first week after putting it on (both at home and previously in a salon) my hair can look a little flat. I spray a root lifter onto my wet hair before blowing it dry, and that helps.  I&#x27;m sure Coppola makes one but I use an inexpensive drugstore brand and it works fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the pluses of keratin is that, because it coats the hair shaft, your hair dries much faster.  Less blow-drying time!  The downside of this is that my hair appears dirtier faster...I think the oil and dirt aren&#x27;t penetrating the hair shaft...they are just sitting on the hair and are more noticeable.  So, for me, when I&#x27;ve had a keratin treatment I have to wash my hair more often (every other day, usually)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m really happy I tried this at home.  It&#x27;s a bit time consuming but not hard, and it&#x27;s a fraction of the price of having it done at a salon!is at home.  It&#x27;s a bit time consuming but not hard, and it&#x27;s a fraction of the price of having it done at a salon!</li>
            <li> Received it timely. Bottle looks fine. Completely sealed and legit.</li>
            <li> I will be buying this product again</li>
            <li> I ordered this after seeing a show on how to use and, I have seen other products like this Howevee, this is so much easlier to use. I used it on my granddaughter and after  her first shampoo she call to tell me how great her hair feels. Right away we noticed the shine.</li>
            <li> nothing more to say but this product works like the treatment even on virgin hair. I have thick curls and they have been tamed since I applied the express treatment.</li>
            <li> Perfect. Easy to use. No more hundreds of dollars at salons for a simple job.</li>
            <li> Good product, very close to the Keratin therapy treatment. Smells just like it but takes have the time and it last a long time.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great. I got the same result as from the salon at a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li> Although the product isn&#x27;t as strong as the 3-4 month Keratin, it definitely fights the frizz. You will have soft, silky and manageable hair in less time. I love this formula because I can not sit still for hours having a treatment done. Well worth the cost and time.</li>
            <li> I am giving this vendor five stars.  I received the product I ordered very quickly and it was packed very well.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product to anyone who has dry, frizzy hair.  I get at least three treatments from this size bottle and am very pleased with the results.  The comparable treatment in the salon is easily $150.  I found it very easy to apply the product myself.  The only advice I can give you is not to oversaturate the hair with product.  My hair stays frizz free for at least three months.</li>
            <li> I returned this product. I did not want to rate the product because I did not read the fine print but I cannot comment unless I assign a rating.</li>
            <li> I bought this product in order to avoid 3 days torture of waiting keratin to infuse the hair. I did it at home with help of my friend and it worked pretty fine. I see the result and it basically the same as it was after salon procedure. I do not know now how long it will last though. 2 oz is more than enough for long hair (40 cm).</li>
            <li> Love this product... Cuts blow dry time in half!</li>
            <li> Worked well. Easy to use and I could wash my hair shortly after. I did not have to wait 2 days. I will definately purchase it again.</li>
            <li> It was great just what I was looking for will order it again when I need it very very soon</li>
            <li> Used this before, works great. For me after 3 weeks, it seemed to feel like the product seemed to begin loosing its effectiveness.</li>
            <li> Just received this product yesterday and used it right away. I have always done the non-express treatment but wanted something to hold me over until my next one.  I left it in for over 24 hours. Don&#x27;t know if that makes a difference! The results are amazing! Hopefully it will last the 4-6 weeks as mentioned!  If it does...I will be a life-long customer! Very happy!!!</li>
            <li> I have thick and frizzy hair.  I use this product every three months.  I have no damage to my hair and it leaves it very smooth and manageable.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without it. I&#x27;m 34yrs old with bad, frizzy, fine hair. This Just makes my hair look soo good for months.</li>
