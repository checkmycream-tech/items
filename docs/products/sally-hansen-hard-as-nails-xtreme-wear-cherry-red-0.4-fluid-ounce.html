            <li>Overall, great buy.</li>
            <li>While this isn&#x27;t my favorite out of all of the Xtreme line I&#x27;ve tried, that&#x27;s just a color preference based on my skin tone right now.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s perfect, not shocking red, but a nice soft cherry red.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty amazing stuff, really.  </li>
            <li>I can go a full day without a nick</li>
            <li>This red color is simply amazing.</li>
            <li>I love the color but the polish wears off within a couple of days, even with 2 coats of clear hardener</li>
            <li>Just got mines , im soo excited because i love having red nails</li>
            <li>the price can&#x27;t be beat (especially considering the other qualities of this awesome polish).</li>
            <li>The color is true, vivid, and this line of polishes is simply fantastic.</li>
            <li>AND this dries super fast!</li>
            <li>Sally Hansen always gets their colors right on.</li>
            <li>My only other comment is that this product is available at some popular department stores like Target and Walmart at more effordable prices.</li>
            <li>it does peel very fast.</li>
            <li>It also comes off super easy with regular nail polish</li>
            <li>Red is my favorite color, and this nail polish exactly matches my expectations.</li>
            <li>This is a pretty bright red color with a shiny wet finished look.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this one!</li>
            <li>It reminds me of the chic, fabulous roaring twenties when wearing red polish was the rage.</li>
            <li>very good&lt;br /&gt;thank</li>
            <li>love the color cherry red matches exactly with my red lipstick!!</li>
            <li>My mom only wore red nail polish, and I have grown to love it too.</li>
            <li>I live this nail polish.</li>
            <li>I think this is more of a summer red for me, but of course, I&#x27;m just one (white) woman whose skin tone is a little on the \\&quot;winter is coming\\&quot; side right now.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s clear that the polish was new because the polish was still liquidy and hadn&#x27;t hardened at all around the brush.</li>
            <li>It is a true red - tomato/cherry red.</li>
            <li>If you want any brand of nail polish to last make sure your nails are clean and wipe them down with a small amount of alcohol before you apply the polish.</li>
            <li>True blue color will last about 7 days with two coats no clear needed have 43 of this product in different colors</li>

It reminds me of the chic, fabulous roaring twenties when wearing red polish was the rage. My mom only wore red nail polish, and I have grown to love it too. But, only Sally Hansen polishes give the look I want.</li>
            <li> it does peel very fast.</li>
            <li> I love the color but the polish wears off within a couple of days, even with 2 coats of clear hardener</li>

            <li> I am so glad with my purchase. I arrived on the time and perfect! Like i was waiting. Then i point the company to everybody!</li>

            <li> I live this nail polish. In the past, I would chip my polish within a day. This polish is amazing. I can go a full day without a nick AND this dries super fast! Really, I&#x27;m impressed. I can wear this all week with just a couple touch ups. Very low maintenance and it doesn&#x27;t ruin your nails like shellac or gel nail polishes. It also comes off super easy with regular nail polish remover.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The package was delivered with little lots of bubble wrap to protect and when I expected. Overall, great buy.</li>
            <li> I use this for fly tying.  It puts a shiny durable head on my flies.  Stands up to water, rocks and teeth and still looks good. Keeps the tying thread from coming undone. Works great.</li>
