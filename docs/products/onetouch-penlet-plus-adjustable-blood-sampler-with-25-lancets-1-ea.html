            <li>As a physician I am many times checking blood sugars on my patients.  </li>

            <li>I love the Penlet Plus.</li>
            <li>I test a lot and am still looking for something better,</li>
            <li>and she is able to stay healthy without help.  </li>

            <li>It has saved me many accidental punctures.</li>
            <li>will make sure I order from you when the time comes that I need a replacement.</li>
            <li>The product was okay</li>
            <li>The Penlet is my favorite lancing device.</li>
            <li>Which considering how many times a day/per year it is used....</li>
            <li>Once finished remove the cap, pull out the needle/plastic rod and dispose of it safely.  </li>
            <li>She was so used to her original Penlet, that when it broke, I thought she would not be able to continue checking her blood glucose on her own.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s pretty good for a piece of plastic.</li>
            <li>you can not only count on Amazon for having this but the price was very good also.  </li>
            <li>this is a great replacement for the old pen style lancet devices.</li>
            <li>Once again this is the most fantastic device ever invented.</li>
            <li>And since the parts aren&#x27;t interchangeable with the original, I&#x27;m doing a much better job of keeping things together.  </li>
            <li>chose this as my original penlet top was damaged and wouldn&#x27;t stay on the device.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li>This one seems a lot more solid and has been working great.</li>
            <li>Lancets are easy to put in and remove.</li>
            <li>Not as easy to use as my Accu-chek Softclix, but somehow i got a bunch of lancets that fit this</li>
            <li>Works fine</li>
            <li>This device allows me to do this quickly and safely.</li>
            <li>Pretty easy and very comfortable.</li>
            <li>IT IS GREAT FOR SMALLER HANDS.</li>
            <li>Pen makes a squeaky sound, but it works.</li>
            <li>and that is so important for me.</li>
            <li>Seems Amazon can always fit the bill.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s handling is comfortable.</li>
            <li>May order another while they are still available.</li>
            <li>but they wont fit in the penlet plus.  </li>
            <li>I broke the original device that came with the monitor</li>
            <li>Bought this after my original lancing device broke.  </li>
            <li>Even though One Touch replaced my original device, I&#x27;m still using this one.</li>
            <li>It performed as advertised and was quite easy to use and delivered the right sample size to activate my meter.  </li>
            <li>The One touch penlet plus purchase from Amazon was great as expected.  </li>
            <li>I liked the item as you can push the lancets which my old one didn&#x27;t have.</li>
            <li>sometimes The included purple lancets are not as good as the white ones.</li>
            <li>Delivery was quick.</li>
            <li>The item was shipped and received quickly and well packaged.  </li>
            <li>This smaller version of the One Touch Lancing Device; works with my existing \\&quot;lancets\\&quot;, which is good and is a fine replacement/additional device; since I couldn&#x27;t buy the clear \\&quot;cap\\&quot;; for my original, which I lost/discarded.  </li>
            <li>I like this much better than the new models.</li>
            <li>This is the third one I own, for me</li>
            <li>went to my local CVS and all they had were their own tool.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like the cheap lancet devices that new meters come with</li>
            <li>I will surely come back again when I am in need of another.  </li>
            <li>Does exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>works better than the generic types found at cvs pharmacy</li>
            <li>The longer Penlet design fits better in my big hands, and the ejection feature makes it easier to remove the used lancet.</li>
            <li>A big deal if you use this device many times a day..</li>
            <li>They never failed.  </li>
            <li>, why did I buy another one if it never failed?  </li>
            <li>My old penlet had a much stronger release, creating the necessary puncture much more easily.</li>
            <li>but when i did open this item i found the glucose strips expired since 2007 , and more information i am ready to swear  that this is the truth i need compensation for that .    </li>
            <li>You can stop reading now since the rest is just filer for Amazon reviews which require a certain number of words?</li>
            <li>I have gotten new meters over the years but the pens that came with them just didn&#x27;t work right and no store I could find had this one.</li>
            <li>thanks so much</li>
            <li>It was received fast.</li>
            <li>Screwing the cap on strait requires too much attention.</li>
            <li>I needed to replace mine but didn&#x27;t want to buy the whole kit.  </li>
            <li>Just what I needed for a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>Thanks.  </li>
            <li>My last penlet died pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>One thing to be aware of, it&#x27;s a new pen</li>
            <li>This is exactly like her old one</li>
            <li>Price was very competative for a new penlet plus blood sampling device.  </li>
            <li>I had used one for several years, but the top finally would not stay on.</li>
            <li>One feature that I had  not observed in older models is the ejection system built into the pen.  </li>
            <li>Older version ..........much easier to use than &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; now offered by Lifescan.  </li>
            <li>Most lancet holders just break after a few uses.</li>
            <li>Penlet enables me to use my current blades and pierces my fingers to  just the right depth.  </li>
            <li>I found a new one on here, so I bought it.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t want to just buy new lancets), so this product met that</li>
            <li>/&gt;Would recommend to anyone who needs to replace the blood sampler for use with onetouch lancets.&lt;br /&gt;Another plus is that the new penlet is practically painless on a lower setting, so the sampling seems</li>
            <li>Other than the color, this is exactly the same one that came with my original meter.</li>
            <li>Lifesaver for a replacement on my old penlet.</li>
            <li>Item delivered early, and works just as advertised.  </li>
            <li>I ordered this for my 91 year old Mom.  </li>
            <li>Very please with the overall purchase.</li>
            <li>and I need a device that will get through them (the soft touch type don&#x27;t work for me).</li>
            <li>Purchased this because my old one completely fell apart.  </li>
            <li>Just remember they use different lancets than the older models.</li>
            <li>and after I dropped my other one on a tile floor it would not work right.  </li>
            <li>My old one broke after 7 years, so I had to have a new one and could only find it online.  </li>
            <li>This is an essential part of my daily blood sugar testing and was reasonably priced here, for what I saw elsewhere.</li>
            <li>I like everything but can&#x27;t adjust enough to get a good &amp;#34;hit&amp;#34; on blood withdraw have to push it down hard to get a sample.</li>
            <li>I only use the clear tip when my fingers need a break from normal daily testing</li>
            <li>Works as expected and the price was reasonable.</li>
            <li>We can all be a little naive, but the price for this penlet was more than twice that of a complete glucometer kit including a meter, test strips and a penlet.</li>

            <li> We can all be a little naive, but the price for this penlet was more than twice that of a complete glucometer kit including a meter, test strips and a penlet.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want to have to be buying a new one every few months.</li>

            <li> I hope it lasts a long time.</li>

            <li> The ones it uses are slightly smaller than the other One Touch Lancets.</li>
            <li> The One-Touch lancing device is designed to allow much wider adjustment for the depth of lancet penetration, so while it is never comfortable, at least the pain is minimized.  </li>
            <li> Only disappointment is that this package did not come with the clear tip to use on alternate testing sites.</li>
            <li> You take a plastic rod with a needle stuck in one end and shove the other end into this miracle machine.  </li>
            <li> so i don&#x27;t have to dispose my lancets I previously bought.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;to hurt less, IMHO.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t justify paying the price they ask for these and then have them break a few months down the road.</li>
            <li> so the springs are really tight so even on the lowest setting</li>
            <li> Makes me mad because there really isn&#x27;t another one like it on the market.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I can only &amp;#34;love&amp;#34; it for a few months before it breaks</li>
            <li> it usually lasts a year at 4 times a day.</li>
            <li> so I usually use this lancet device.</li>
            <li> Even if it breaks in a few months, at least I&#x27;m not paying five times that amount for it.</li>
            <li> Works well, my son is hard on penlets and it is still working.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This smaller version of the One Touch Lancing Device; works with my existing \\&quot;lancets\\&quot;, which is good and is a fine replacement/additional device; since I couldn&#x27;t buy the clear \\&quot;cap\\&quot;; for my original, which I lost/discarded.  And since the parts aren&#x27;t interchangeable with the original, I&#x27;m doing a much better job of keeping things together.  This is an essential part of my daily blood sugar testing and was reasonably priced here, for what I saw elsewhere.</li>
            <li> Works well, my son is hard on penlets and it is still working.</li>
            <li> i did recieve one touch penlet plus, adjustale blood sampler with one 25 lancets-ea / but when i did open this item i found the glucose strips expired since 2007 , and more information i am ready to swear  that this is the truth i need compensation for that .    thanks so much</li>
            <li> The penlet works great - I am happy to be able to adjust the depth of the lancet.  I just hope it lasts longer than my last one.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;VE HAD ONE OF THESE FOR AT LEAST 10 YEARS. I LOVE HOW IT FEELS WHEN YOU HOLD IT.  iT IS NOT BULKY. IT IS GREAT FOR SMALLER HANDS.</li>
            <li> I broke the original device that came with the monitor so I needed a replacement to continue to do blood tests. The replacment works for me. I also purchased a spare just in case I need one again.</li>
            <li> It was received fast. Pen makes a squeaky sound, but it works.</li>
            <li> This pen was first given out with the meters and Lifescan stopped sending them when originals broke and so hard to find but thank goodness I did!  Your fingers don&#x27;t hurt compared to what you get nowadays and that is so important for me.</li>
            <li> I had used one for several years, but the top finally would not stay on. I found a new one on here, so I bought it. I like the device for the ability to adjust the penetration depth, as well as it&#x27;s simple to function. I may just buy another or two just to have.</li>
            <li> We can all be a little naive, but the price for this penlet was more than twice that of a complete glucometer kit including a meter, test strips and a penlet.</li>
            <li> Lifesaver for a replacement on my old penlet. I liked the item as you can push the lancets which my old one didn&#x27;t have. Delivery is also good. Works great so i don&#x27;t have to dispose my lancets I previously bought.</li>
            <li> Item delivered early, and works just as advertised.  Extremely pleased!!</li>
            <li> I like the way it works- it usually lasts a year at 4 times a day.</li>
            <li> Great penlet .  Nice size to handle and has a stick that is comfortable. I check 7-8 times daily I will stick with this penlet.</li>
            <li> When Accu Check quit making their tough lancet hold this one is almost is as good.  Most lancet holders just break after a few uses. Also I don&#x27;t change lancets every time (since it is me only that it is sticking) and I think that prolongs the life of the holder.</li>
            <li> As a physician I am many times checking blood sugars on my patients.  This device allows me to do this quickly and safely.</li>
            <li> Have had a hard time finding the OneTouch..you can not only count on Amazon for having this but the price was very good also.  I will surely come back again when I am in need of another.  Seems Amazon can always fit the bill. It&#x27;s pretty bad when the company that makes this and has a 5yr warrenty on them cannot replace the same exact one.</li>
            <li> This is the third one I own, for me it&#x27;s handling is comfortable. And I cannot get this product locally because newer smaller ones are replacing it.</li>
            <li> this is a great replacement for the old pen style lancet devices. I don&#x27;t like the cheap lancet devices that new meters come with so I usually use this lancet device. Only disappointment is that this package did not come with the clear tip to use on alternate testing sites. I only use the clear tip when my fingers need a break from normal daily testing</li>
            <li> I gave this a 5-star rating as I am extremely happy with the product.&lt;br /&gt;I chose this as my original penlet top was damaged and wouldn&#x27;t stay on the device.&lt;br /&gt;It was difficult to find a device that would work with the supply of lancets I already had on hand&lt;br /&gt;(and I didn&#x27;t want to just buy new lancets), so this product met that need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend to anyone who needs to replace the blood sampler for use with onetouch lancets.&lt;br /&gt;Another plus is that the new penlet is practically painless on a lower setting, so the sampling seems&lt;br /&gt;to hurt less, IMHO.</li>
            <li> I like everything but can&#x27;t adjust enough to get a good &amp;#34;hit&amp;#34; on blood withdraw have to push it down hard to get a sample.</li>
            <li> This was bought for my husband, Rodney, who is a diabetic.  He had been using an earlier Penlet II unit, and was disappointed when it broke.  This one has proven to be a very good replacement - very convenient and dependable.</li>
            <li> I have been searching for this type of lancet device for a long time.  The two I received are perfect.  And I received them promptly and packaged well.  Two thumbs up.</li>
            <li> Was the same product that came with my meter but quality has not improved. Screwing the cap on strait requires too much attention. They should make the product with better threads to improve the usability.</li>
            <li> My last penlet died pretty quickly. This one seems a lot more solid and has been working great. I hope it lasts a long time. I don&#x27;t want to have to be buying a new one every few months.</li>
            <li> Good product.  Does the job.</li>
            <li> Does exactly as advertised. Delivery was quick. I would recommend to others. You can stop reading now since the rest is just filer for Amazon reviews which require a certain number of words?</li>
            <li> I have ordered 2 penlet plus lancing devices in the past year and both have broken within weeks of use.</li>
            <li> Very comfortable.  Bought this after my original lancing device broke.  Even though One Touch replaced my original device, I&#x27;m still using this one.</li>
            <li> I love the Penlet Plus. Unfortunately, I can only &amp;#34;love&amp;#34; it for a few months before it breaks and I have to buy another one. Makes me mad because there really isn&#x27;t another one like it on the market. I can&#x27;t justify paying the price they ask for these and then have them break a few months down the road. I found one that is somewhat similar for about four dollars....shipping and all. Even if it breaks in a few months, at least I&#x27;m not paying five times that amount for it.</li>
            <li> The product still suffers from glitches . Not really ideal hangs up sometimes The included purple lancets are not as good as the white ones. I test a lot and am still looking for something better,</li>
            <li> I have been a diabetic for 30 some years and started with the One Touch penlet to monitor my blood sugar. Through the years, my lancet kit had changed from good to worthless.  I saw the Penlet Plus through the internet and without a doubt ordered it, since then I am happy and satisfied of my purchased.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my 91 year old Mom.  She was so used to her original Penlet, that when it broke, I thought she would not be able to continue checking her blood glucose on her own.  This is exactly like her old one and she is able to stay healthy without help.  Delivery was on time.</li>
            <li> The unit works well; it is a replacement for one that had worn out over time.  One feature that I had  not observed in older models is the ejection system built into the pen.  Very handy, and it will help lessen the wear and tear.</li>
            <li> The One touch penlet plus purchase from Amazon was great as expected.  Price was very competative for a new penlet plus blood sampling device.  The item was shipped and received quickly and well packaged.  Very please with the overall purchase.</li>
            <li> This is a perfect replacement for the original one that came with my kit.</li>
            <li> I bought this penlet back in 2000. It has been working great now for 11 years. That&#x27;s pretty good for a piece of plastic. It seems fairly sturdy. I use it with One Touch UltraSoft lancets and I have the Penlet Plus set at a low setting of about three. I am always able to get a drop of blood with one try. The shallow prick does not hurt my finger.</li>
            <li> Was very satisfied with this product.  It performed as advertised and was quite easy to use and delivered the right sample size to activate my meter.  I just ordered another one from Amazon to use with my traveling meter.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for.  I needed to replace mine but didn&#x27;t want to buy the whole kit.  Great service and quick turnaround.</li>
            <li> Other than the color, this is exactly the same one that came with my original meter. I have gotten new meters over the years but the pens that came with them just didn&#x27;t work right and no store I could find had this one. One thing to be aware of, it&#x27;s a new pen so the springs are really tight so even on the lowest setting it still goes a bit deep :( Hopefully it will loosen up soon.</li>
            <li> works better than the generic types found at cvs pharmacy</li>
            <li> A perfect replacement for the original one that came with my kit.</li>
            <li> Older version ..........much easier to use than &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; now offered by Lifescan.  May order another while they are still available.</li>
            <li> This is the best lancing device I have ever had because you don&#x27;t have to handle the used lancet to get it out.  It has saved me many accidental punctures.</li>
            <li> Pretty easy and very comfortable.</li>
            <li> The longer Penlet design fits better in my big hands, and the ejection feature makes it easier to remove the used lancet. I will defiantly look into buying another one as a &amp;#34;back-up&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Can use BD 33 Lancets AND can be operated with  one hand.  A big deal if you use this device many times a day..</li>
            <li> It met all of my needs,was unable to find one elsewhere. will make sure I order from you when the time comes that I need a replacement.</li>
            <li> I received this sampler in time, the outer box was smashed, so when I opened the packing, found that the sampler was damaged. I contacted seller but seller has not cared to respond to my complain. I have requested for a refund and still awaiting response.</li>
            <li> This is a good product. It is compact and works well. You just have to get a low cost supply of Lancets.  The ones it uses are slightly smaller than the other One Touch Lancets.</li>
            <li> The product was okay but they claim that it replaces the penlet II.  I have an abundance of lancets for the penlet II but they wont fit in the penlet plus.  A little disappointing to say the least.</li>
            <li> The Penlet is my favorite lancing device. I&#x27;ve been doing finger sticks for 30 years so my fingertips are calloused and I need a device that will get through them (the soft touch type don&#x27;t work for me). This one does, and it&#x27;s durable. Works as expected and the price was reasonable.</li>
            <li> Over the years I&#x27;ve owned several of the Penlet Plus.  They never failed.  Hands above the competition is the fact that you never have to handle the lancet after use.  Penlet Plus will eject it.&lt;br /&gt;So, why did I buy another one if it never failed?  Never broke?&lt;br /&gt;I lost it.  Out riding a couple of weeks ago, my Penlet Plus dropped out of my pocket.  I never missed it until I got home.  Too late then.&lt;br /&gt;I went to my local CVS and all they had were their own tool.  No ejector.  I had to handle the lancet after use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;JUNE 23, 2014&lt;br /&gt;OOPS!  My mistake.  The PENLET PLUS JUST DIED.  My guess is that the spring broke.  Too Bad.  I&#x27;m returning the product today.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll try another, but this one is downgraded to 1 star.</li>
            <li> Purchased this because my old one completely fell apart.  Expensive, but I like the operation and ease of use and I has a lot of money invested in lancets.  I am disappointed in the spring action, however.  My old penlet had a much stronger release, creating the necessary puncture much more easily.</li>
            <li> The Penlet Plus doesn&#x27;t hurt AT ALL.  Very easy to set and use.  Just remember they use different lancets than the older models.</li>
            <li> Not as easy to use as my Accu-chek Softclix, but somehow i got a bunch of lancets that fit this, so i bought this for a spare testing kit.</li>
            <li> Just what I needed for a reasonable price.  Thanks.  Works as stated and after I dropped my other one on a tile floor it would not work right.  Works as stated.</li>
            <li> Love this finger poker! So far the easiest one to use on my daughters little fingers. I have been using them for almost 8 years now, and they seem to last about 3 years before needing to be replaced.  Which considering how many times a day/per year it is used.... I think that is great.</li>
            <li> Penlet enables me to use my current blades and pierces my fingers to  just the right depth.  Lancets are easy to put in and remove.</li>
            <li> This is the wildest device you ever saw, if you need to stick yourself to test your blood sugar this is the most amazing device ever invented.  You take a plastic rod with a needle stuck in one end and shove the other end into this miracle machine.  Screw the cap on, set the number for the depth of penetration to achieve blood flow from your sample site.  Press the trigger button and squint your eyes for the pain to come.  But the pain is only temporary. Once finished remove the cap, pull out the needle/plastic rod and dispose of it safely.  Repeat as required.  Once again this is the most fantastic device ever invented.</li>
            <li> Every thing was just what I needed. Works fine&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
            <li> I like this much better than the new models. I hope you can get it back in stock.</li>
            <li> The One touch Penlet, with the alternate site tip allows testing without pricking your finger.  That means I&#x27;ll do it!  That&#x27;s what counts.  It&#x27;s as simple as that.</li>
            <li> The One-Touch lancing device is designed to allow much wider adjustment for the depth of lancet penetration, so while it is never comfortable, at least the pain is minimized.  My old one broke after 7 years, so I had to have a new one and could only find it online.  I hope this one lasts forever so I don&#x27;t have to search again.</li>
