            <li> These fit my Emjoi perfectly! This variety pack is great and fulfills the needs of our household. The extra coarse is ideal for removing dry heel skin, and the super coarse is perfect for calloused skin. They easily change out depending on what part of your foot you are exfoliating. I will be buying these again when I need them.</li>
            <li> not as high quality as the manufacturers actual refills.  Wore out quickly</li>

            <li> I love the variety pack.  All rolls fit my Emjoi device perfectly! Thanks for a great product.</li>
            <li> I received these at a discount for review. Work great with my emjoi micropedi nano! They pop in and out with no difficulty and I love that it&#x27;s a 5 pack with multiple coarseness options. Perfect for trying everything to see what you like and need.</li>
            <li> They turn until they touch your skin, then they stop turning!</li>
            <li> Awesome fits well and removes all the dead skin off the heels of the foot nicely. I love the nice and soft feeling. A plus product at a great price!  I recievedt this product at a disconted price  ine xchange of an honest review!</li>
            <li> Great!! Installed in seconds and saved me a lot of money. I will definitely continue to get my refills here, and will now change them more often. Fast shipping too!</li>

            <li> Very pleased with product, Shipping was faster than expected.</li>
            <li> I received this product in exchange for a honest review. These are great for those ruff feet that you have. If you have the machine these go into them the replacements are amazing, they are strong and sturdy and they are easy to replace. They come in a pack of 5 which is great you may need to replace every 2 three month so these will last you maybe a year maybe less. My last pack lasted me about a year which is great. Overall great product</li>
            <li> This multi-pack is the best deal, after tons of searching, that I found for Emjoi refills.  Having the option of swapping out the level of coarse-ness is genius. I&#x27;d much rather have the option of swapping them for another grit rather than having a huge stack of one kind. Once you have your feet all cleaned up and pretty, you may not need the rough grit anymore so swap it-you can;) They were delivered right on time and were well packaged. Perfect for &amp;#34;sandal ready&amp;#34; summer feet!</li>
            <li> Nice product not as course as i thought, but does the job. They are durable and great for at home pedicures. Suitable for Both Men as well as Women.

            <li> I like the different refills.  I did not want to buy a package of each one.</li>
            <li> Great purchase. Love the different coarse  and works great!</li>
            <li> Wording is extremely deceptive in that the rollers are not of the same quality as the Emjoi original rollers. These are knockoffs what while are cheaper, do not work.</li>
            <li> Not Emjoi quality definitely generics, not nearly the quality of Emjoi</li>
            <li> product is durable and does the job. My grandma loves it</li>
            <li> Super tiny. I think they  are only good for very short hair.</li>

            <li> Great and very helpful to have this selection of different grits!</li>
            <li> These were a great buy. They were not too rough or soft. Very happy with them and the quality is good.</li>
            <li> Good little variety for my callouses on my feet. These devices are great. I prefer them over manual callous removers.</li>
            <li> Great for in between Pedi&#x27;s</li>
            <li> Works great and removes all the dead skin ,so  your skin looks  nice and soft.</li>
            <li> Excellent.  I&#x27;m glad I got extra so my husband can use his own.</li>
