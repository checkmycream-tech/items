            <li>My husband kept commenting on my &amp;#34;fancy eyes&amp;#34; :)</li>
            <li>I happen to LOVE each and every color in this palette, which doesn&#x27;t happen too often for me.</li>
            <li>Too many times I&#x27;d just use a couple of colors out of many, but not in this case.</li>
            <li>Some shadows were more pigmented than others.</li>
            <li>Cute colors &amp; love</li>
            <li>This is easily my favourite eyeshadow set.</li>
            <li>SO many different looks and great pigment</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t impressed with the red I was hoping for more of a shimmery red</li>
            <li>Gorgeous palette, very pigmented arrived very rapidly</li>
            <li>They arrived quickly and they work beautifully.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Great quality for a reasonable price, definitely beats paying high amounts for overpriced cosmetics</li>
            <li>/&gt;VERY pigmented, super fine milled -not heavy or chalky at all.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I&#x27;m looking for-</li>
            <li>They are very pigmented, they blend well &amp; they stay put after I put them on!</li>
            <li>i didnt notice any fallout and the colors are easy enough to build and blend.</li>
            <li>I want to try some of the other pallets soon :)</li>
            <li>Well pigmented, arrived early and goes on smooth with minimal crumble/fall out.</li>
            <li>and so far this is the only shadow I&#x27;ve used in that time!</li>
            <li>These colors are so vibrant AND long lasting!</li>
            <li>The palette was smaller than I expected and the colors weren&#x27;t very pigmented.</li>
            <li>Two of them (next to the red) have a tiny amount of shimmer in them, the rest are completely matte.&lt;br</li>

            <li> But it doesn&#x27;t last very long, so I&#x27;m going to have to buy something for that.</li>
            <li> It was a lot smaller than I expected.</li>
            <li> I needed a dark palette with red for prom.</li>
            <li> as expected.</li>
            <li> A little goes a loong way and it stays on for a long time.</li>
            <li> The shimmery black and grey-ish brown aren&#x27;t very dark.</li>
            <li> The few colors that were intact dont apply well.</li>
            <li> The black was broken when i got it and fell out.</li>
            <li> You can make them subtle or intensify them.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with nyx.</li>
