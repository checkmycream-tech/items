            <li>I really love this set.</li>
            <li>Many people complain in their comments on these mini polishes about \\&quot;how small\\</li>
            <li>Came in 2 days which I was very happy about, and they actually sent me what I ordered.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t even tell you how many times I&#x27;ve ordered polish from a seller off here</li>

            <li>I will buying much more soon</li>
            <li>Colors are OK.</li>
            <li>These are mini bottles which means you have to make sure to have a glob to spread or the color thins.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Nail polish should stick without needing a top coat.</li>
            <li>I wish I could return it and get some from a better company</li>
            <li>so i&#x27;m really glad</li>
            <li>They arrived quickly and packaging was very secure!</li>
            <li>Even if I coat it with a top coat, the top coat stays fine</li>
            <li>This would ideally be for a younger girl, maybe preteen.</li>
            <li>Colors are bright and vibrant.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s basically good for a 5yrs old but love the colors</li>
            <li>Great colors love doing the pink with silver over it :)</li>
            <li>Not the best quality- strong smell and not super smooth application, but can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li>these would be cute for a tween :) FAST SHIPPING</li>
            <li>Pretty colors &amp; the glitters are cute but fall off the nail.</li>
            <li>These are small bottles, but perfect for a stocking stuffer for my step-daughter.  </li>
            <li>The light pink is a trendy color; the red is gorgeous; and the glitters spread really nicely.</li>
            <li>i m glad to order this kind of stuff in future</li>
            <li>but if you want to paint a full nail that color</li>
            <li>I figure she will try but not the super overpriced stuff the stores and name brands sell.</li>
            <li>quick and as described</li>
            <li>The colors were cute, but the smell of the polish is strange and overwhelming.</li>
            <li>Excellent long lasting polish!</li>
            <li>It was a gift for my step daughter, she said she liked it, I personally have not seen the nail polish</li>
            <li>I recommend just getting two or three bottles of NICE nail polish for the same price in a drug store.</li>
            <li>Strongly recommend getting one of those long lasting top coats to secure more then a day&#x27;s worth of wear.</li>
            <li>Great small favors for a bridal shower</li>
            <li>This set is so cute and so much fun to mix and match colors for different looks.</li>
            <li>These bottles are small, but the for the price I couldn&#x27;t ask for better nail polish; the pink is bright!</li>
            <li>and I really like these!</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>The assortment of colors are really pretty</li>
            <li>Pretty colors.</li>
            <li>Cute colors, glitter polish has large shapes, not tiny flecks.</li>
            <li>Cute but no stay long</li>
            <li>&quot; lol, DUH!</li>
            <li>Kleancolor nail polishes are pretty decent quality.  </li>
            <li>so the use of them will be limited other then that, great colors</li>
            <li>Niece, age 13, really likes the colors and stated the polish lasts.</li>
            <li>I got this for a present and took a chance, but by far most embarrassment when my friend opened it and applied it.</li>
            <li>The main color I wanted to....</li>
            <li>Highly recommend  KleanColor.</li>
            <li>had the throw many of the bottles away because they dried up</li>
            <li>Small, but cute colors and sparkles.</li>
            <li>Wanted to throw a few small inexpensive things in with here gift and this was a great add-on.</li>
            <li>My only thing was the bottles were only halfway full, and there mini bottles</li>
            <li>It might as well be clear:</li>
            <li>The bottles are quite small but could still do a few full manicures, and the seller is honest about them being fashion size not full size bottles.</li>
            <li>In fact, the one with heart glitter the pieces barely come out at all!</li>
            <li>other mini collections I&#x27;ve ordered from KleanColor really complain about the size.</li>
            <li>the other items have been shipped back to their warehouses because of incomplete address problems.. dummies; highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I personally did not use the product as they were purchased for a game for a wedding shower, but the winners were excited to try out the sparkle/polish color combos!</li>
            <li>My only complaint is that the light pink does not pain on well at all if you are using it to do detail using a nail art brush</li>

            <li> I even put chip resistant polish on a base coat, then the color, then a top coat, but to no avail it still chips!!  </li>
            <li> I really like this set with the small bottles.  </li>
            <li> Does not last long.</li>
            <li> it is very difficult to get a nice even opaque coat.</li>
            <li> Bottle size was smaller than I expected.</li>
            <li> First off, the bottles are so unbelievable smallThe main red and pink colors are so thin.</li>
            <li> I would ask person before I recommend this product because although you get 6 bottles they can go fast due to small size.</li>
            <li> Even then, the consistency was off and it took forever to dry.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t surprised at all with how small they were.</li>
            <li> I finally broke down and ordered them.</li>
            <li> I could only use a few colors.</li>
            <li> Keep your money and shop elsewhere,this product is not worth the money</li>
            <li> But when you need a polish fix and on a tight budget, KleanColor is the way to go.</li>
            <li> I suspect the polishes are very old, as they are very thick making them hard to apply.  </li>
            <li> None of he colors were dried out.</li>
            <li> Waste of money and time.</li>
            <li> ( it was too inexpensive to waste my time to return in.</li>
            <li> It gave it to my granddaughter to &amp;#34;play&amp;#34; with and she won&#x27;t get tired of any color and let it dry up!  </li>
            <li> Some of them are a little on the thick side, but I just use those for stamping, or thin them down with a little nail polish thinner.</li>
            <li> Waaaaaaay too small.</li>
            <li> Small containers.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s like every ordinary nail polish.</li>
            <li> Rather small, even for minis.</li>
            <li> Its hard to even pick up a heart with the brush.</li>
            <li> You have to add a little bit of nail polish remover to thin it out.  </li>
            <li> Not satisfied!</li>
            <li> Real poor quality nail polish, waste of money</li>
            <li> This was by far the worst nail polish I purchased.</li>
            <li> Very unhappy, waste.</li>
            <li> OMG it is so difficult to get any of the hearts to go on to the brush</li>
            <li> Too bad the nail polish comes off when you wash dishes.</li>
            <li> Smelled TERRIBLE and way too toxic to send as party favors for my daughter&#x27;s twelfth birthday party.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love nail polish and I really like these! My only thing was the bottles were only halfway full, and there mini bottles so the use of them will be limited other then that, great colors</li>
            <li> One of them is tiny heart sparkles. I love the colors. Great for a stocking stuffer. ;)</li>
            <li> I really love this set. I wasn&#x27;t surprised at all with how small they were. Many people complain in their comments on these mini polishes about \\&quot;how small\\&quot; the bottles are. I don&#x27;t think I saw any on this review item...but other mini collections I&#x27;ve ordered from KleanColor really complain about the size. It&#x27;s not called \\&quot;mini\\&quot; because they&#x27;re \\&quot;big\\&quot; lol, DUH! Anyways, the colors are beautiful. Came nicely packaged. None of he colors were dried out. The only reason I&#x27;m giving it a 4 star is because the \\&quot;heart\\&quot; glitter in this package...OMG it is so difficult to get any of the hearts to go on to the brush the actually paint on to the nail. And when I do get a heart on the brush it only ends up being 1 or 2 hearts at a time. PAIN IN THE BUTT. 5 stars for the seller though. Came in 2 days which I was very happy about, and they actually sent me what I ordered. I can&#x27;t even tell you how many times I&#x27;ve ordered polish from a seller off here and when it came in it wasn&#x27;t even close to what I had ordered. So thumbs of to seller for sure! Highly recommend  KleanColor. I am a China Glaze, Essie girl all the way. But when you need a polish fix and on a tight budget, KleanColor is the way to go. The polish may not be the most \\&quot;expensive\\&quot; polish...but there are some cheap polishes out there that are great and KleanColor is one of them!</li>
            <li> Cute colors, glitter polish has large shapes, not tiny flecks. Not the best quality- strong smell and not super smooth application, but can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li> I could only use a few colors. The glitter ones..came out with no glitter. Waste of money and time.</li>
            <li> Great colors love doing the pink with silver over it :)</li>
            <li> Came very quickly, and the polishes are good colors and sizes! I havent given them to my friend yet, but I&#x27;m sure she&#x27;ll love &#x27;em!</li>
            <li> This would ideally be for a younger girl, maybe preteen. The colors were cute, but the smell of the polish is strange and overwhelming.</li>
            <li> Great small favors for a bridal shower</li>
            <li> If you are hesitating buying this set of nail polishes-don&#x27;t. The price kind of threw me off too. I himmed and hawwed over these for 2 months. I finally broke down and ordered them. They are really nice. The quality is good and the colors are beautiful. And let&#x27;s face it, you can&#x27;t beat the price!!</li>
            <li> See pastel summer collection.</li>
            <li> Love this set. Too bad the nail polish comes off when you wash dishes. Does not last long. Strongly recommend getting one of those long lasting top coats to secure more then a day&#x27;s worth of wear.</li>
            <li> I hosted a Spa Birthday Party for my daughter and ordered these to set up the &amp;#34;Nail&amp;#34; station. She loved it and the polish was great!</li>
            <li> It was a gift for my step daughter, she said she liked it, I personally have not seen the nail polish</li>
            <li> The colors are very cute, which is why I did not leave a 1 star review.  I suspect the polishes are very old, as they are very thick making them hard to apply.  You have to add a little bit of nail polish remover to thin it out.  Even then, the consistency was off and it took forever to dry.</li>
            <li> Keep your money and shop elsewhere,this product is not worth the money</li>
            <li> The nail polish chips off the very next day. I work typing in computers and it actually chips off. Even if I coat it with a top coat, the top coat stays fine but you can see the color chipping underneath! WTH! DO NOT BUY if you are looking for nail polish that lasts!</li>
            <li> Kleancolor nail polishes are pretty decent quality.  Some of them are a little on the thick side, but I just use those for stamping, or thin them down with a little nail polish thinner. I bought these as a birthday gift for a tween, and she loved them.  The assortment of colors are really pretty and there&#x27;s a great variety of effects and finishes, too.</li>
            <li> had the throw many of the bottles away because they dried up</li>
            <li> grand-daughter will love these colors She is gettin make up, nail polish, and jewelry from me.  She gonna love me</li>
            <li> Cute but no stay long</li>
            <li> Small, but cute colors and sparkles. I personally did not use the product as they were purchased for a game for a wedding shower, but the winners were excited to try out the sparkle/polish color combos!</li>
            <li> My mother loves these colors!</li>
            <li> Real poor quality nail polish, waste of money</li>
            <li> These were a baby shower favor from my best friend.  They colors are GREAT and I could not wait to try them; however, the polish chips off within hours of applying it!  I even put chip resistant polish on a base coat, then the color, then a top coat, but to no avail it still chips!!  I would not recommend this polish.</li>
            <li> Only get about two terms</li>
            <li> Smelled TERRIBLE and way too toxic to send as party favors for my daughter&#x27;s twelfth birthday party. Very unhappy, waste.</li>
            <li> Waaaaaaay too small. It&#x27;s basically good for a 5yrs old but love the colors</li>
            <li> These bottles are small, but the for the price I couldn&#x27;t ask for better nail polish; the pink is bright! The light pink is a trendy color; the red is gorgeous; and the glitters spread really nicely. The customer service was awesome too. I ordere about 6 items from 6 different vendors and this vendor is the only that called and emailed me to get my correct mailing address.. the other items have been shipped back to their warehouses because of incomplete address problems.. dummies; highly recommend! I will buying much more soon</li>
            <li> Like the product, however one of the colors leaked all over the place. The main color I wanted to....</li>
            <li> Nice colors no problem with packing and would recommend. Bottle size was smaller than I expected. I would ask person before I recommend this product because although you get 6 bottles they can go fast due to small size. Product was received in excellent condition. Colors are OK.</li>
            <li> These are mini bottles which means you have to make sure to have a glob to spread or the color thins. A couple of the bottles have a glitter substance but these don&#x27;t come out evenly. In fact, the one with heart glitter the pieces barely come out at all! It might as well be clear:( it was too inexpensive to waste my time to return in. Not satisfied!</li>
            <li> Cousin gift for christmas. Wanted to throw a few small inexpensive things in with here gift and this was a great add-on. Simple colors I figure she will try but not the super overpriced stuff the stores and name brands sell.</li>
            <li> Pretty colors. So so durability. Small containers.</li>
            <li> Arrived promptly, daughter loves these.</li>
            <li> This set is so cute and so much fun to mix and match colors for different looks. They arrived quickly and packaging was very secure! Super happy with this set.</li>
            <li> Totally did not realize that it said &amp;#34;mini&amp;#34; when I bought these but they work just as well and are adorable! these would be cute for a tween :) FAST SHIPPING TOO!</li>
            <li> Niece, age 13, really likes the colors and stated the polish lasts.</li>
            <li> Colors are bright and vibrant. Polish stays on the nail and doesn&#x27;t chip. Great polish for the price. I love it.</li>
            <li> quick and as described</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s like every ordinary nail polish.</li>
            <li> Pretty colors &amp; the glitters are cute but fall off the nail. But can&#x27;t beat the variety for the price. Rather small, even for minis.</li>
            <li> These colors are great for the price. The bottles are quite small but could still do a few full manicures, and the seller is honest about them being fashion size not full size bottles. My only complaint is that the light pink does not pain on well at all if you are using it to do detail using a nail art brush it works but if you want to paint a full nail that color it is very difficult to get a nice even opaque coat.</li>
            <li> This was by far the worst nail polish I purchased. I got this for a present and took a chance, but by far most embarrassment when my friend opened it and applied it. First off, the bottles are so unbelievable smallThe main red and pink colors are so thin. And the red glitter/ heart nail polish immediately fell off after drying. Its hard to even pick up a heart with the brush. Nail polish should stick without needing a top coat. I wish I could return it and get some from a better company but it was a present and she was nice about it and took it. I recommend just getting two or three bottles of NICE nail polish for the same price in a drug store.</li>
            <li> I really like this set with the small bottles.  It gave it to my granddaughter to &amp;#34;play&amp;#34; with and she won&#x27;t get tired of any color and let it dry up!  AND if there&#x27;s a color she loves, I can get her a larger bottle.  She&#x27;s almost 13 and loves experimenting with all things like this....it&#x27;s a nice set.</li>
            <li> Excellent long lasting polish!</li>
            <li> Nice colours, nice quality..i m glad to order this kind of stuff in future so i&#x27;m really glad bla bla</li>
            <li> My daughter liked it. She is a teen and I guess it worked for her.</li>
            <li> These are small bottles, but perfect for a stocking stuffer for my step-daughter.  Colors are great, good array to choose from - I hope she enjoys them.</li>
            <li> pretty colors and great price</li>
