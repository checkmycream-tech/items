            <li>This is a great way to be introduced to the product.</li>
            <li>It smells wonderful on top of that.</li>
            <li>Good stuff.  </li>
            <li>Good experience.</li>
            <li>I was especially excited when they offered the sampler, what a awesome idea, all hair products should do this, it will give it customers a chance to see if the product works with their hair, and helps cut the cost on purchased prices of large jars and leave unused products on the shelf at home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Smells awesome, feels good no flake dries fast.</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>have to say, I&#x27;m really glad I dished the $26 out for this!</li>
            <li>the As I Am products, it was amazing.</li>
            <li>i am loving this hair care package.</li>
            <li>The scent is nice though.</li>
            <li>A bit of variety, and a great way to test out the line before buying full size products.  </li>
            <li>Perfect for a natural sistas that travel a lot.  </li>
            <li>Definitely, best natural hair product.</li>
            <li>Really loving these products, makes my hair softer and more manageable.</li>
            <li>Glad As I Am became available, and best of all it&#x27;s offered on Amazon at a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll probably buy the kit again to ensure great hair days ;).</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I am an Amazon prime member and the delivery time is on point 90% of the time, considering most of the time I&#x27;m overseas.</li>
            <li>This APO just opened and Amazon was still able to send a prompt delivery.</li>
            <li>Great natural hair product wish i had more</li>
            <li>So far, so good.  </li>
            <li>Used Diva products for years and loved it, but it wasnt working on my hair anymore...tried numerous products.  </li>
            <li>Creams weigh my hair down, so I was not a fan of it, but love, love, love the co-wash, leave in conditioner, and also go the clarifying shampoo and cannot rave enough about it!  </li>
            <li>I put it on and it is fabulous even though i have a peak of natural and the rest perm</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just as satisfied, if not more satisfied, with drugstore products, in slip and detangling.</li>
            <li>I have tried all 6 products now, for cleansing, conditioning and styling my short curly tapered cut and like most of them.</li>
            <li>I have never been able to get second day hair, on any length of hair, until trying those two products together</li>
            <li>found I don&#x27;t have to use a whole lot to get the results I need.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>haha.</li>
            <li>a heads up, both the leave in and curling jelly have a sort of slimy smooth consistency similar to flaxseed gel</li>
            <li>So I took a chance on the kit, which included the Elation Hydration product along with 5 other of their better known products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Decent amount of slip.</li>
            <li>I 3c thin hair with a sensitive scalp and this product line is amazing for my hair.</li>
            <li>Hair is soft and define.</li>
            <li>As I Am Naturally in a magazine and wanted to try it.</li>
            <li>short faded cut its like a new look.</li>
            <li>After reading several online reviews on this line (not many people tried the DC), it was all pretty positive.</li>
            <li>I was recently browsing my local Duane Read for a new deep conditioner and stumbled upon this kit.</li>
            <li>Now that I&#x27;m here in Africa, it&#x27;s a little to hot to wear wigs all the time.</li>
            <li>Turns out my least favs are Elation Hydration and Coconut cowash, I have regular conditioners I used to cowash and ended up getting a cheap cholesterol conditioner that I tweak for deep conditioning</li>

            <li> Perfect for a natural sistas that travel a lot.  Love it!</li>
            <li> Love it. Hair is soft and define. Smells wonderful. Definitely, best natural hair product.</li>
            <li> i am loving this hair care package. My favorites are the cowash, deep conditioner, and the leave in. the only product i don&#x27;t like is the jelly, it&#x27;s too sticky.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still trying to figure out how to and when to use which one,  but that just takes a little research.

            <li> Good stuff.  A bit of variety, and a great way to test out the line before buying full size products.  The only item that I would buy again is the co-wash.  The twist cream left my hair sticky.  The scent is nice though.</li>
            <li> Great natural hair product wish i had more</li>
            <li> I read about As I Am Naturally in a magazine and wanted to try it.

            <li> Used Diva products for years and loved it, but it wasnt working on my hair anymore...tried numerous products.  A friend recommended this and it is awesome!  Creams weigh my hair down, so I was not a fan of it, but love, love, love the co-wash, leave in conditioner, and also go the clarifying shampoo and cannot rave enough about it!  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Purchased for my daughter for her flight for summer vacation. Great!! She loves it. And travel size convenient for flights no problem!</li>
            <li> So far, so good.  Good experience. Bi like the way my hair feels.</li>
            <li> Really loving these products, makes my hair softer and more manageable.</li>
            <li> Great item for the price</li>
            <li> Feeling meh about this brand. I care for the hair of my two biracial daughters, three and five. They both have very different types of curls. I&#x27;m just as satisfied, if not more satisfied, with drugstore products, in slip and detangling. I didn&#x27;t care for these products enough to repurchase</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of products and I&#x27;m happy to say this is a KEEPER.</li>
            <li> One of the tubed was half empty. It was the Shampoo.</li>
            <li> While this is just a small sample of the As I Am products, it was amazing. I bought it to see how it would work for my hair and to know if i was going to buy it and i definitely will, it worked wonders for my hair.</li>
            <li> I was recently browsing my local Duane Read for a new deep conditioner and stumbled upon this kit. I was curious to try the deep conditioner (Elation Hydration I&#x27;m assuming is the DC anyway) but at the price for the size I wasn&#x27;t feeling it as I&#x27;m a cheapie hair product buyer haha. After reading several online reviews on this line (not many people tried the DC), it was all pretty positive. So I took a chance on the kit, which included the Elation Hydration product along with 5 other of their better known products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to say, I&#x27;m really glad I dished the $26 out for this! I have tried all 6 products now, for cleansing, conditioning and styling my short curly tapered cut and like most of them. My favorites have to be the leave in, double butter cream, curling jelly(best product for my hair in the line) &amp; and the twist and define cream works similar to a gel for me which I love!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just a heads up, both the leave in and curling jelly have a sort of slimy smooth consistency similar to flaxseed gel (Google it if you haven&#x27;t seen it). This is great for my hair because it has slip, and us curly girls know the importance of slip! I have never been able to get second day hair, on any length of hair, until trying those two products together so yeah, impressed! Turns out my least favs are Elation Hydration and Coconut cowash, I have regular conditioners I used to cowash and ended up getting a cheap cholesterol conditioner that I tweak for deep conditioning haha!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps someone! And next time I travel I&#x27;ll probably buy the kit again to ensure great hair days ;).</li>
            <li> I 3c thin hair with a sensitive scalp and this product line is amazing for my hair. It keeps my hair soft, hydrated, and maintains my curl definition without heavy product buildup.</li>
            <li> this just did nothing for my hair at all, will not be purchasing again</li>
            <li> The perfect sample/travel size.</li>
            <li> I was introduced to this product by one of my co-workers. I&#x27;ve been natural for a while, but I never really took time to train my hair because I wouldn&#x27;t be caught without sew-in. Now that I&#x27;m here in Africa, it&#x27;s a little to hot to wear wigs all the time. These products are wonderful for mosturizing and curl definition. It smells wonderful on top of that. I am an Amazon prime member and the delivery time is on point 90% of the time, considering most of the time I&#x27;m overseas. This APO just opened and Amazon was still able to send a prompt delivery.</li>
            <li> Decent amount of slip. I will buy again.</li>
            <li> This is a great way to be introduced to the product. I used it as a travel pack</li>
