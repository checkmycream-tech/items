    <ol>
            <li>Apart from not using a couple of the colours, I am very happy with this product.</li>
            <li>I even use it on Pedicures and it lasts and is awesome.       </li>
            <li>The finished result is quite impressive.</li>
            <li>Beautiful.</li>
            <li>Great service from these guys.</li>
            <li>Great gels.</li>
            <li>Amazing!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s wonderful and is easy to remove IF</li>
            <li>Product is really good.</li>
            <li>The mailing package for this product was in good condition leaving me to believe that the contents inside would be in good shape.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased with my purchase</li>
            <li>But I love Axxium which is the original /the best of Soak off gel, I believe in Axxium</li>
            <li>This is the first set of Axxium polish I bought when I decided to start doing my own Axxium manicures at home, and it&#x27;s the perfect starter kit!  </li>
            <li>Despite loads of advice on the internet against non-professionals doing their own nails, I decided to buy this kit and give it a try.</li>
            <li>Regarding the colors in the kit, they&#x27;re kind of blah.</li>
            <li>Great starter kit with affordable price and quick shipping.</li>
            <li>They tend to be very light, even transparent.</li>
            <li>Its ok because I am able to practice get my skills for doing my nails at home up to speed-</li>
            <li>so now i don&#x27;t have to keep going to the salon, Love it...</li>
            <li>I love the reds and pinks.</li>
            <li>and I can&#x27;t wait to try more colors and techniques.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t forget, you have to use a UV light with this!</li>
            <li>I was not disappointed!   </li>
            <li>At first, I didn&#x27;t like it because it didn&#x27;t look as glossy as I had liked.  </li>
            <li>Several shades of beautiful pinks.</li>
            <li>I am happy with this set overall - with the exceptions that the colors are glittery which is not described.  </li>
            <li>It is a super starter package and you get everything you need apart from the lamp and it&#x27;s easy to use</li>
            <li>It would have been helpful if the description on Amazon was more detailed listing the exact contents including sizes.</li>
            <li>Also, it would be nice if it included Remover, then it would be a complete set to get you started.</li>
            <li>thanks you Healthy Beauty 4U</li>
            <li>colors aren&#x27;t true.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re also planning to start doing your own manicures and are in search of a salon grade UV light, I highly recommend the Thermal Spa 49135 Professional U/V Gel Light Nail Dryer - this starter kit with the light is the perfect starter combo (and so much cheaper than having your nails professionally done every other week)!</li>
            <li>I really like this product, but it is chemically strong and ruined my nails.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Only thing OPI needs to do is make more colors!  </li>
            <li>On the plus side, you can paint right over the gel, so who cares?    </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s actually a kind of grey gel.</li>
            <li>Some color are very light colors if you compare to regular opi polish.</li>
            <li>I love everything about OPI gels and selected this product over the Gelish or Shellac because it last longer.</li>
            <li>no chip is exactly what I have.  </li>
            <li>*Be aware that the colors are not as the appear in the container.</li>
            <li>And i did watch the video first every time and did as they instructed.</li>
            <li>I love all of the colors, they&#x27;re neutral enough to wear every day, and are also light enough that you can&#x27;t see imperfections that come with the first few tries of learning to do your own manicures :).  </li>
            <li>very deceiving service</li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>Not only am I pleased with the results, but I have already recommended this kit to several others who were interested.</li>
            <li>They put the primer, the first clear coat on, then put 2 coats of the color.  </li>
            <li>Perhaps a general downloadable colour chart could be useful.</li>
            <li>I had troubles with the local post office failing to deliver my package and Healthy Beauty 4U were quick to help chase down my item.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I should disclaim that my normal home manicure skills are decent, so my results with this kit probably reflect that.    </li>
            <li>I bought an inexpensive UV light from Amazon, and had absolutely no problems.</li>
            <li>peels right off same  day.</li>
            <li>Although it was much pricer than a fill-in and a little less than a full set, I would gladly pay for this again.  </li>
            <li>The colors are very neutral with the exception of the hot pink, which really looks like a bubble gum color.</li>
            <li>I found that once you wash your hands later once the gel is cured with the uv light the shine comes back like you have acrylics on.  </li>
            <li>The colors are clear.</li>
            <li>2 huge tips: do NOT peel off gel nails because it really does take off some layers of your real nails and will thin them out a lot.</li>
            <li>My nails look like they were professionally done.</li>
            <li>the rest of the colors look like a tinted clear coat- similar to the pink color when you request pinks and whites when getting a full set.</li>
            <li>Other then keeping those 2 things in mind it&#x27;s really worth it.</li>
            <li>I would not recommend this to the normal user but for a professional only.</li>
            <li>and I started getting my nails done with the no chip it was great but was getting very expensive.</li>
            <li>I decided to try the Axxium Soak-Off Gels Pretty Pink and Pales Starter Kit because it seemed to have all of the information/products needed to apply gel to nails.  </li>
            <li>Pretty in Pink...</li>
            <li>The only disappointing thing (and reason for 4 stars) about this kit for me is that I like bright vibrant colors.</li>

            <li> There was a little learning curve, but now I can get salon quality nails on myself!</li>
            <li> You just need to follow the steps and apply the gel in thin layers, being careful to stay away from your cuticles.</li>
            <li> It usually lasts 2 weeks before it starts peeling in the corners.</li>
            <li> On the other hand, I was disappointed by the price I paid in relation to how long they lasted.    </li>
            <li> The product is very thick and difficult to use.</li>
            <li> This was an expensive set and it is just so-so.</li>

            <li> I love everything about OPI gels and selected this product over the Gelish or Shellac because it last longer. The only disappointing thing (and reason for 4 stars) about this kit for me is that I like bright vibrant colors. I knew the colors were pale but other then the Strawberry Margarita the rest of the colors look like a tinted clear coat- similar to the pink color when you request pinks and whites when getting a full set. Its ok because I am able to practice get my skills for doing my nails at home up to speed- then I am going to order a set of different colors.</li>
            <li> I am happy with this set overall - with the exceptions that the colors are glittery which is not described.  Also, it would be nice if it included Remover, then it would be a complete set to get you started.</li>
            <li> saving lots of money with this purchase, i was spending $50 a month so now i don&#x27;t have to keep going to the salon, Love it...</li>
            <li> Colors are not as described</li>
            <li> I decided to try the Axxium Soak-Off Gels Pretty Pink and Pales Starter Kit because it seemed to have all of the information/products needed to apply gel to nails.  I was not disappointed!   Not only am I pleased with the results, but I have already recommended this kit to several others who were interested.</li>
            <li> Product is really good. Starter kit had everything. Gel nails really do last about 2 weeks If applied properly. 2 huge tips: do NOT peel off gel nails because it really does take off some layers of your real nails and will thin them out a lot. Next tip, becareful when applying gels... Do not get Gel on cuticles or on skin around nails. Once cured then it will not come off and will cause the gel to peel. Other then keeping those 2 things in mind it&#x27;s really worth it. Nails come out super shiny and very hard. Beautiful.</li>
            <li> I got this done last week and no chip is exactly what I have.  NO CHIPS!  I got it done at a salon and I would recommend this to any woman who is trying to get away from the acrylic nails.  They buffed my nails by hand, not with that danged electric thing.  They put the primer, the first clear coat on, then put 2 coats of the color.  Then they put the sealer on.  At first, I didn&#x27;t like it because it didn&#x27;t look as glossy as I had liked.  I found that once you wash your hands later once the gel is cured with the uv light the shine comes back like you have acrylics on.  Although it was much pricer than a fill-in and a little less than a full set, I would gladly pay for this again.  I eventually will buy the system myself and start working on them!  Only thing OPI needs to do is make more colors!  I love the reds and pinks.</li>
            <li> Great service from these guys. I had troubles with the local post office failing to deliver my package and Healthy Beauty 4U were quick to help chase down my item. thanks you Healthy Beauty 4U</li>
            <li> Great starter kit with affordable price and quick shipping.You will need a stirring stick to mix Axxium gel.Some color are very light colors if you compare to regular opi polish.I had to apply 3-4 coats of gel. But I love Axxium which is the original /the best of Soak off gel, I believe in Axxium</li>
            <li> When you buy OPI, you know you&#x27;re getting a quality product. Great gels. As I am not particularly familiar with the OPI Axxium range I unfortunately was not familiar with the contents of this particular package. It is a super starter package and you get everything you need apart from the lamp and it&#x27;s easy to use but I&#x27;m not too fond of all the colours. The names of the colours are quirky but not descriptive. It would have been helpful if the description on Amazon was more detailed listing the exact contents including sizes. From the picture, I thought one of the gels was a white..but it&#x27;s actually a kind of grey gel. Perhaps a general downloadable colour chart could be useful. Please keep in mind, I am a newbie and not familiar with OPI gel products. Apart from not using a couple of the colours, I am very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> I had the worst nails ever! I always got gel nails and I would spend almost $100.00 a month and then the no chip system came out and I started getting my nails done with the no chip it was great but was getting very expensive. So I purchased the set myself and have been doing it ever since! I must agree that it has not harmed my nails IF YOU USE IT CORRECTLY! You need to have patience with the product and carefully follow the instructions. Why would you not use this product? It&#x27;s wonderful and is easy to remove IF AGAIN YOU USE IT CORRECTLY!   I have had nothing but complements when it comes to my nails. I even use it on Pedicures and it lasts and is awesome.       ***Be aware that the colors are not as the appear in the container. Some are ALOT lighter and you may need several coats***</li>
            <li> A friend told me about UV gel nails a few months ago. After doing lots of research on the process, I had gel nails applied at a local salon. The nails didn&#x27;t last long because the technician did a terrible job, but I liked their shininess and durability. On the other hand, I was disappointed by the price I paid in relation to how long they lasted.    Despite loads of advice on the internet against non-professionals doing their own nails, I decided to buy this kit and give it a try. All I can say is that the pro&#x27;s must be worried about losing business because this isn&#x27;t rocket science! Before doing my nails, I watched the video included in the package, read the booklet, and watched lots of demonstrations on you-tube. It&#x27;s really not that hard. You just need to follow the steps and apply the gel in thin layers, being careful to stay away from your cuticles. I bought an inexpensive UV light from Amazon, and had absolutely no problems. My total investment will pay for itself within 4 applications.    The finished result is quite impressive. My nails look like they were professionally done. I should disclaim that my normal home manicure skills are decent, so my results with this kit probably reflect that.    Regarding the colors in the kit, they&#x27;re kind of blah. Most of them look like a base color for a french manicure. On the plus side, you can paint right over the gel, so who cares?    I&#x27;m very pleased with my purchase and I can&#x27;t wait to try more colors and techniques. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> The colors are clear. Three coats for a pale pale pink.</li>
            <li> This is the first set of Axxium polish I bought when I decided to start doing my own Axxium manicures at home, and it&#x27;s the perfect starter kit!  I love all of the colors, they&#x27;re neutral enough to wear every day, and are also light enough that you can&#x27;t see imperfections that come with the first few tries of learning to do your own manicures :).  If you&#x27;re also planning to start doing your own manicures and are in search of a salon grade UV light, I highly recommend the Thermal Spa 49135 Professional U/V Gel Light Nail Dryer - this starter kit with the light is the perfect starter combo (and so much cheaper than having your nails professionally done every other week)!</li>
            <li> peels right off same  day. I do not recommend at all. And i did watch the video first every time and did as they instructed. even looked online for suggestions.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still waiting for my kit. Bought another one after that and it has already reached me... very deceiving service</li>
            <li> My niece gave me a manicure using this product, and it didn&#x27;t chip at all for TWO WEEKS! Amazing! I am a jewelry designer, and my nails get a workout! I would recommend this to anyone! Don&#x27;t forget, you have to use a UV light with this!</li>
            <li> Pretty in Pink... Several shades of beautiful pinks.</li>
            <li> This was an expensive set and it is just so-so. The product is very thick and difficult to use. I would not recommend this to the normal user but for a professional only.</li>
            <li> I really like this product, but it is chemically strong and ruined my nails.&lt;br /&gt;The colors aren&#x27;t true. They tend to be very light, even transparent.</li>
            <li> I purchased this having never done gel nails to myself. There was a little learning curve, but now I can get salon quality nails on myself! The colors are very neutral with the exception of the hot pink, which really looks like a bubble gum color. It usually lasts 2 weeks before it starts peeling in the corners. I really like it.</li>
            <li> The mailing package for this product was in good condition leaving me to believe that the contents inside would be in good shape. How ever when I opened the package all the contents feel out everywhere.  I did check and believe that all the items are in there.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t get it to actually cure. The few time it has the polish is see through</li>
