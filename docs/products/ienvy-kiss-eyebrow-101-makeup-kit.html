            <li>pretty good to use and easy</li>
            <li>Bought these, the elf stencils and some other ones and I like these the best.</li>
            <li>Easy to use, but would prefer having a stencil that sticks to your face though,</li>
            <li>Perfect for my dark eyebrows.</li>
            <li>These are just right!</li>
            <li>i love the stencils but it is darker than what i expected and it is kind of hard to keep the stencil in while drawing your eyebrow but its great!</li>
            <li>it works great but color way to dark</li>
            <li>- they are all very large.  </li>
            <li>I usually use this, great result, no smearing</li>
            <li>Shipped very fast.</li>
            <li>iked them very much</li>
            <li>If done properly, you will not get that drawn on look like I see from most people that use just a pencil.</li>
            <li>but overall I&#x27;d recommend it :)</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>Great, the dark brown in the center blends right and well in with my eye brow color.</li>
            <li>I used the delicate or sexy and it&#x27;s really fun</li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;d say the item is worth what it costs.</li>
            <li>its very natural looking apposed to using a pencil.</li>
            <li>Natural look</li>
            <li>The Delicate is the only one that seems to look good on me, as the other 2 stencils are very large for someone with a bigger forehead.</li>
            <li>The colors are quite dark, so if you&#x27;re blonde or light brunette you might want to go with another kit.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend especially to those with oily skin.</li>
            <li>WITH SMALL TILT BRUSH SUPPLIED ALONG WITH COMFORTABLE REUASABLE STENCILS.</li>
            <li>I finally threw my old one out.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>

            <li> I finally threw my old one out.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> You really have to apply it carefully.</li>
            <li> There was an error in my packaging, as the kit should come with 4 stencils including: Delicate, Sexy, Natural, and Dramatic.</li>
            <li> stencils are reusable and the material is durable once you take your time and store them flat carefully, they should last a very long</li>
            <li> My kit was missing the Natural stencil, and came with 2 Delicates instead.</li>
            <li> For some reason other stencils are too long.</li>
            <li> you have to use sparingly or its to dark</li>
            <li> I have dark brown hair and brown eyebrows but both colors are way too dark.</li>
            <li> Only problem is the angled brush that it comes with is a bit thick for my liking.</li>
            <li> Also, colors are very dark, if you are a blond on lighter color hair - you will want to purchase a lighter brow color to add to what is included in this order.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not easy.</li>
            <li> The stencils are a bit hard to use, but that could just be because of my lacking skills.</li>
            <li> The powder had broken up and was all gone.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit difficult to use with one hand</li>

            <li> I like this you have to use sparingly or its to dark but once you get use to it it&#x27;s good ,holds on  well but  Not waterproof though would like a waterproof one !</li>
            <li> it works great but color way to dark</li>
            <li> Shipped very fast. I was satisfied with the product. No problems. Love it</li>
            <li> I !iked them very much</li>
            <li> This product is NOT for AFRICAN AMERICAN WOMEN.  It looks like i put cigarette ashes on my eyebrows...and yes, I was using the darkest shade</li>
            <li> LOVE, LOVE, LOVE THIS SET. STAYS ALL DAY. NICE COLORS. I USE IT DAILY  WITH SMALL TILT BRUSH SUPPLIED ALONG WITH COMFORTABLE REUASABLE STENCILS. WILL PURCHASE AGAIN.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit difficult to use with one hand but otherwise I enjoy using the product!</li>
            <li> if you have darker eyebrows then this is for you!! I love it!</li>
            <li> I usually use this, great result, no smearing</li>
            <li> Love this eyebrow kit! Highly recommend especially to those with oily skin.</li>
            <li> Very good product. I love it!&lt;br /&gt;The stencils are reusable and the material is durable once you take your time and store them flat carefully, they should last a very long time.&lt;br /&gt;The stencils can even be used a makeup teaching tool.</li>
            <li> wish one of the stencils was thinner - they are all very large.  Also, colors are very dark, if you are a blond on lighter color hair - you will want to purchase a lighter brow color to add to what is included in this order.</li>
            <li> Bought these, the elf stencils and some other ones and I like these the best. For some reason other stencils are too long. These are just right! Love them and the highlight and shades are nice too. Perfect for my dark eyebrows.</li>
            <li> If your a dark-skinned person here&#x27;s the eyebrow kit for you. I use it everyday. Lots of different stencils to chose from. If done properly, you will not get that drawn on look like I see from most people that use just a pencil. Only problem is the angled brush that it comes with is a bit thick for my liking. But not a problem, I just use my own.</li>
            <li> Yes, It work. Practice makes perfect</li>
            <li> I just loved it, it&#x27;s just applying my eyebrow is getting more easier and easier. I used the delicate or sexy and it&#x27;s really fun and I&#x27;m getting compliments.</li>
            <li> I had an eyebrow kit from Avon that I bought about 17 years ago. The powder had broken up and was all gone. I could not throw it away, but this has been a great replacement. I finally threw my old one out.&lt;br /&gt;The powder is perfect for my brows.</li>
            <li> The colors are quite dark, so if you&#x27;re blonde or light brunette you might want to go with another kit. The stencils are a bit hard to use, but that could just be because of my lacking skills.

            <li> Easy to use, but would prefer having a stencil that sticks to your face though, but overall I&#x27;d recommend it :)</li>
            <li> I have dark brown hair and brown eyebrows but both colors are way too dark. You really have to apply it carefully. It works but it&#x27;s not easy.</li>
            <li> Awesome kit. Natural look</li>
            <li> Great product, fast shipping. Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> pretty good to use and easy</li>
            <li> I honestly really do love it...LOVE the hightlighter ...i feel so sexy when i fill in my eyebrows....the pencils are wonderful</li>
            <li> i love the stencils but it is darker than what i expected and it is kind of hard to keep the stencil in while drawing your eyebrow but its great! my eyebrows look better :)</li>
