            <li> Kinda pricey but worth it. My Dominican hairdresser told me about it and I love it. Tingles in a good way, doesn&#x27;t dry your hair. I need to use it more consistently before I can confirm it helps with hair loss.</li>
            <li> This shampoo may have worked for others but unfortunately it did not work for me.  I used it in conjunction with the Una Drops and neither helped in stopping my shedding hair.  I was very disappointed as both these items were expensive.  Iâ€™m now trying a hair vitamin and I will hopefully get some results with that.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my wife and she loves it.</li>
            <li> s supposed to help hair lose.  I have been using it for about 3plus months and have seen no improvement to my thinning hair.  It smells like pine tar.  My scalp turns red when I use it.  The bottle is SO large it is awkward to handle. For the amount of money I paid  ( on sale)  I can say I&#x27;m not pleased at this point. However I do intend to give the product three more months because i have made the investment and because I want to make sure i haven&#x27;t judged it prematurely.  Pla</li>
            <li> Pleasant feeling when washing my hair. If it works? Can&#x27;t say for sure... But the hair loss didn&#x27;t become worse at least... Using it in combination with UNA drops for 4 weeks yet, still waiting for visible result... Giving it a chance)</li>
            <li> I have used the shampoo a couple of times and, it has a weird smell to it.  I thought it would smell like the deep conditioner (which it has a great smell to it.).  I have only rated three starts because, I haven&#x27;t seen results yet.  I will post another review will I start seeing or not results.</li>
            <li> My Beautician used this on my hair becasue my hair was damaged badly from the previous stylist ugggg. This shampoo tingles so you know it&#x27;s working. My hair is stronger and healther since i&#x27;ve been using it. I would recommend the UNA line to anyone who has damaged hair or anyone who wants to maintain healthy strong hair. So worth it.</li>
            <li> A good giftfor my sister</li>
            <li> Love love love this shampoo</li>
            <li> After using it for a couple of days, you can start seeing the difference, my hair doesn&#x27;t end up in my bathtub.</li>
            <li> my friend told me about this shampoo. I did not purchase it online yet since I was able to find it at local beauty supplies. I first used it a week ago. My experience is so far so good. I have permed hair and I love how it makes my scalp feels fresh after wash.</li>
            <li> Excellent. It&#x27;s work as expected.</li>
            <li> It does not provide a result as claimed after I have used this product for 10 months.</li>
            <li> I have been using this amazing product since June and I dont have words to explain how my hair have changed. is shine, looks healthier, and sleek. my hair is stronger now. My hair is like African hair and it was weak, but now is long and strong!!!!</li>
