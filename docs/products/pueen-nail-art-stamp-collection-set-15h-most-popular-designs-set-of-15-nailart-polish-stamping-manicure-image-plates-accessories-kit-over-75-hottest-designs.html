            <li>This was much better quality than the set that I purchased from the pheen.  </li>
            <li>Ok</li>
            <li>Every time you use it though you need to make sure that you wipe of the polish between each stamping.</li>
            <li>the quality is so cheap I could not believe these came from PUEEN!</li>
            <li>Love the designs.</li>
            <li>I love the idea of them, directions should always be included where I had none.</li>
            <li>and I was successful the first time.</li>
            <li>I love these designs.  </li>
            <li>I love the unique designs!</li>
            <li>My daughter is loving being so artistic.</li>
            <li>So far, I have had great luck with stamping (using the Pueen tools) and placing them on my manicure.  </li>
            <li>Also easy transfers of designs.  </li>
            <li>It made it easy</li>
            <li>but once you get used to the whole process it&#x27;s totally worth it and very pretty!!!!</li>
            <li>These work great ,stamp clear ,cute designs any problem I had had to do with the stamper or nail polish when you get the right stamper and polish</li>
            <li>Great selection of various stamping plates.</li>
            <li>Never disappointed.  </li>
            <li>Pueen nail plates have very clean and crisp nail designs.  </li>
            <li>Has been used several times and youtube videos provide good info to demonstrate usage.</li>
            <li>Quick shipping.</li>
            <li>I bought these Pueen plates because they were pretty cheap</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for dupes then these are OK, but if you are wanting crisp images I would recommend getting the real thing.</li>
            <li>Product is easy to use and seems reasonable quality.  </li>
            <li>having fun using them.</li>
            <li>fun stuff.  </li>
            <li>They are fun to mix and match.  </li>
            <li>Some may be a bit small but they will be perfect for accent nails or to do french tips.</li>
            <li>they work just like all the other nail art stamps, I love these designs!</li>
            <li>especially the music note one:)</li>
            <li>thanks pueen!</li>
            <li>This was my first nail art stamp set.  </li>
            <li>The etchings are crisp, and stamp well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>There was a good variety of pictures available with this set, and the price was right, My daughter has some of the expensive brand, and cannot tell the difference between it or any of the lower cost brands I have bought from Amazon.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re a fan of the majority of these images, it&#x27;s a cheap buy and worth it, but if you&#x27;re looking for some of the more intricate and thin lined images, just buy the real thing.</li>
            <li>These plates are stamped really well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kind of hard at first</li>
            <li>For the most part they stamp fairly well, especially the bigger images, but for the intricate ones like the music note (one of two images I bought the set for), hardly stamps well at all.</li>
            <li>I was given a few plates with the same design, I like that there are many things to choose from</li>
            <li>so small only my pinky nail will be able to make use of the &amp;#34;full nail&amp;#34; stamps.</li>
            <li>I hope they come out with extra large plates for people with larger nail beds.</li>
            <li>I was very surprised to see  just how TINY the images were on these plates -</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, the full nail images are on the small side, and measure 12x15 millimeters, so keep that in mind when ordering this set.</li>
            <li>assumed that they would be of decent size like my other pueen plates.(Love Elements)</li>

            <li> Beautiful images! Some may be a bit small but they will be perfect for accent nails or to do french tips.</li>
            <li> There was a good variety of pictures available with this set, and the price was right, My daughter has some of the expensive brand, and cannot tell the difference between it or any of the lower cost brands I have bought from Amazon.  I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Never disappointed.  Very fast shipping and great quality. No plates where damaged and all where different. Also easy transfers of designs.  Must use thick polish like any other plate to make it work.</li>
            <li> These are obviously dupe plates. The quality is so-so, and some of the images have lines too thick to stamp clearly. If you&#x27;re looking for dupes then these are OK, but if you are wanting crisp images I would recommend getting the real thing.</li>
            <li> As pictured. As described. I would definitely purchase again. Great selection of various stamping plates. Quick shipping. Just need a book to keep them in now! :)</li>
            <li> Love stamping with these products.</li>
            <li> The plate images are really cute but did not know whether to order them or not because of price but I&#x27;m glad I bought them ...I have been doing my nails everyday.</li>
            <li> These work great ,stamp clear ,cute designs any problem I had had to do with the stamper or nail polish when you get the right stamper and polish they are wonderful !</li>
            <li> The etchings were very detailed w/o being blurry! The stamps were cute &amp; with more practice on my part, my nails will be picture perfect in no time!!</li>
            <li> I bought these Pueen plates because they were pretty cheap and I had been assured that Pueen&#x27;s images were all their own. Sadly that&#x27;s not the case for this set of plates. They&#x27;re all dupes of Konad ones. For the most part they stamp fairly well, especially the bigger images, but for the intricate ones like the music note (one of two images I bought the set for), hardly stamps well at all. The nail tips seem to stamp well overall, and the flowers. If you&#x27;re a fan of the majority of these images, it&#x27;s a cheap buy and worth it, but if you&#x27;re looking for some of the more intricate and thin lined images, just buy the real thing.</li>
            <li> I rate this 5 stars because it works well and I love it :] I have other brands but this one works great. Happy with this set.</li>
            <li> Product is easy to use and seems reasonable quality.  Has been used several times and youtube videos provide good info to demonstrate usage.</li>
            <li> I just received these and couldn&#x27;t wait to try them out.  I had no problems stamping the images.  This is a good buy for the price</li>
            <li> Pueen nail plates have very clean and crisp nail designs.  I hope they come out with extra large plates for people with larger nail beds.</li>
            <li> I am very happy to see that my order arrived quickly. I am a YouTuber. and I change my nail designs quit often for my videos.These stamp plates arrived in there own pkg, and no scratches to be found. I am enjoying that i have more way to design my nails and I will be purchasing more stamp plates for my collection.</li>
            <li> This was much better quality than the set that I purchased from the pheen.  I do like this product.  Ok</li>
            <li> I love the designs on each template, there&#x27;s so many to choose from! Every time you use it though you need to make sure that you wipe of the polish between each stamping. It&#x27;s kind of hard at first but once you get used to the whole process it&#x27;s totally worth it and very pretty!!!!</li>
            <li> I am not happy with these plates! the quality is so cheap I could not believe these came from PUEEN! The images are too small and they don&#x27;t stamp well. Not recommended.</li>
            <li> having fun using them.</li>
            <li> There are so many great designs.  There is a design in here for any special occasion, this has saved me a lot of money on getting my nails done!!!</li>
            <li> These plates are stamped really well. i have not any issues with the images not transferring. You will not regret purchasing this set.</li>
            <li> fun stuff.  My daughter is loving being so artistic.</li>
            <li> they work just like all the other nail art stamps, I love these designs! especially the music note one:) thanks pueen!</li>
            <li> Love the designs. Works great!</li>
            <li> These disks stamp well and offer a good variety of images.</li>
            <li> I chose this rating because the metals were all scratched so I could never get the design on my nail correctly. I love the idea of them, directions should always be included where I had none.</li>
            <li> I was given a few plates with the same design, I like that there are many things to choose from but i would have preferred to have every plate with different designs on it</li>
            <li> I was very surprised to see  just how TINY the images were on these plates - so small only my pinky nail will be able to make use of the &amp;#34;full nail&amp;#34; stamps. They&#x27;re so small, my preteen niece could use these...but NOT any adult woman I know...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I assumed that they would be of decent size like my other pueen plates.(Love Elements) But they&#x27;re not.  VERY disappointed in this set; although there&#x27;s a few images I&#x27;ll use I do feel like I&#x27;ve wasted my money. I&#x27;ll think twice before I purchase any other pueen plates.</li>
            <li> They arrived in little time! I read the description of the plates, looked at them online before I purchased them, but was still amazed by all of the designs when I received them! This is a very good deal!</li>
            <li> I like the little individual designs.  They are fun to mix and match.  So far, I have had great luck with stamping (using the Pueen tools) and placing them on my manicure.  I use Soguesswhat11 stamping techniques, and she rocks!!!  It made it easy and I was successful the first time.</li>
            <li> I love these designs.  This was my first nail art stamp set.  I use the konad nail art double ended stamper with these designs and they work perfectly!  I love the unique designs! This product delivered!</li>
            <li> I received 15 different plates, just as pictured. It&#x27;s a nice starter set with a good variety of images. The etchings are crisp, and stamp well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the full nail images are on the small side, and measure 12x15 millimeters, so keep that in mind when ordering this set.</li>
