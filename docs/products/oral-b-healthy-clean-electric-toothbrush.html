            <li>The Oral B Triumph Tooth Brush is one of the best tools for maintaining a healthy mouth.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>O Best use of a gift card all year &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, 5/5 for an incredibly effective brush!</li>
            <li>Awesome toothbrush, cleans so much better than a manual.</li>
            <li>After some stern lectures from my dentist and hygienist that I have to pay more attention to my brushing, I decided to do some research on the best toothbrush I can get.&lt;br</li>
            <li>they could sell it with more brushes in the kit, then the product might be perfect.</li>
            <li>This electric toothbrush is unbelievably effective!</li>
            <li>recommended, easy to use, arrives as requested, great price, battery works perfectly and manuals and accesories are ok.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it was actually a pleasant experience.  </li>
            <li>This does a great job, and my mouth feels clean and wonderful when I&#x27;ve finished.  </li>
            <li>I never knew my teeth could be this clean!!!</li>
            <li>Extremely happy with the product and of course Amazon and their amazing customer service.</li>
            <li>Let me just tell you, it works just as good now as it did the day I bought it.  </li>
            <li>and I loved that toothbrush too.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Veeery good product.</li>
            <li>A choice of intensity seems good for sensitivity.</li>
            <li>Good value for the money and lasts longer than Sonic toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li>loved my Sonicare for years and years.  </li>
            <li>Battery life has been good.  </li>
            <li>We are delighted with the performance and the way it makes your teeth feel.  </li>
            <li>I loved the product.</li>
            <li>To be fair</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t have a clue if it is good or not.</li>
            <li>Good buy.</li>
            <li>Its best to allow the brush head to do its job with light pressure.  </li>
            <li>my dentist said my teeth are looking really good</li>
            <li>my dentist loves my good checkups from using a power brush</li>
            <li>I wonder what designer thought thisi was a good idea.</li>
            <li>The product is good.</li>
            <li>gums are looking so good now.</li>
            <li>it was a good buy.</li>
            <li>Returning this toothbrush despite its good reviews.</li>
            <li>My dentist has remarked on how good my oral hygiene is now...</li>
            <li>No joke, they are that good.</li>
            <li>a good amount of time to spend brushing.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Good toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m  delighted with my purchase of the Oral B electric took brush.  </li>
            <li>I never thought in a million years I would be writing a review for an electric toothbrush, but the Oral B Precision 5000 is about as good as it gets.  </li>
            <li>Good oral hygiene is a must in our family.  </li>
            <li>It was avery good investment.</li>
            <li>good deal too.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t say enuf good about this coupled with water pic.  </li>
            <li>I guess this is as good as it gets.  </li>
            <li>Once you use it you realize you can not do as good a job by manual brushing.</li>
            <li>Good Product I would buy it again.</li>
            <li>I like the toothbrush as it has done a good job cleaning my familes teeth.  </li>
            <li>The prongs do a good job of removing food particles between the teeth but take some getting used to.  </li>
            <li>Incredible, my teeth have never looked better.</li>
            <li>All the modes feel good to use.</li>
            <li>Good product</li>
            <li>as described -- though I expect that to diminish as the unit ages as rechargeable batteries aren&#x27;t good forever (and are NOT replaceable despite the fact they are removable.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but gum issues do run in my family -- hopefully with a good oral health plan including this brush</li>
            <li>In fact, they saw how good my teeth were doing</li>
            <li>charger is good and the timer is good&lt;br /&gt;Recommend to all</li>
            <li>the good reviews states.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>My teeth feel so good after brushing now.  </li>
            <li>The handle is waterproof, and has a good rubbery grip surface.  </li>
            <li>The pros I talked with say Oral-B is the best toothbrush available.</li>
            <li>Seems petty, but if it works, that&#x27;s good for my teeth.  </li>
            <li>As good as I had hoped.  </li>
            <li>I have found the Braun Oral B toothbrushes to be of consistently good quality.  </li>
            <li>Since I bought this, my dentist has seen good result when I go in for my appointments.</li>
            <li>I then decided to buy a good electric toothbrush based off a recommendation from a friend.  </li>
            <li>Maybe I have been unlucky, but as good as Braun&#x27;s are, I think they have a design problem.</li>
            <li>A very useful item and performs great cleaning!!</li>
            <li>Excellent purchase, well worth it!</li>
            <li>Love it - always thought I did a good job brushing until I used this!  </li>
            <li>it works wonderful and my teeth feel as clean as when I go to the dentist.</li>
            <li>Works wonderful, leaving teeth squeeky clean.</li>
            <li>I think it does a wonderful job of keeping your teeth clean.</li>
            <li>10 years+ of loyal service!!!</li>
            <li>The timer helping you to brush in each quadrant of your mouth to make sure you cover all areas is a great idea.  </li>
            <li>As shown by most reviews, this is a great brush.  </li>
            <li>I am very satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li>Great i love it works like a charm</li>
            <li>This was well worth the cost and this brand is the best I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li>I also never thought I&#x27;d spend $100 on a toothbrush, but I&#x27;m very glad I did.  </li>
            <li>I am very pleased with its performance.  </li>
            <li>Great product, Love it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased with this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>Wonderful product worth every penny, like the 5 speeds.</li>
            <li>I am very satisfied with the Braun 5000.</li>
            <li>I am sure its a great toothbrush.</li>
            <li>the built in timer was something I thought was just a gimmick but found it to be very satisfying.  </li>
            <li>I am VERY glad I invested the money.  </li>
            <li>Been using this toothbrush for 2 months now and I am very satisfied with it.  </li>
            <li>and I must say i am very satisfied with Oral B.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>I loved it so much my wife bought one for herself and she has been equally impressed.</li>
            <li>What a great clean feeling!</li>
            <li>My two minutes and this clocks two minutes sure do differ!  </li>
            <li>I had to convince him to try it because he was sure nothing could replace his &amp;#34;old faithful&amp;#34;!</li>
            <li>At first I didn&#x27;t know why he got it for me because I was very happy with my Sonicare toothbrush that I&#x27;ve been using for about 10 years now.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love my Oral-B electric toothbrush!  </li>

            <li>I love oral b product because they do what they were meant to do!</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s pretty impressive in my book.</li>
            <li>Gramps and me love this bells whistling model for our oral care!</li>
            <li>This toothbrush does an excellent job helping me make sure i clean all of my teeth.</li>
            <li>It has a strong motor, and feels great on my teeth.</li>
            <li>The directions were great and easy to understand.</li>
            <li>This is so easy to use and my teeth and gums feel great.</li>
            <li>Every time I use it, I feel like I&#x27;m at the dentist, except its a much more pleasant experience.</li>
            <li>it works great and it was available at a great price.&lt;br /&gt;it is easy to operate and understand.&lt;br /&gt;thank</li>
            <li>to the Smart guide, this would be an excellent feature for kids.  </li>
            <li>The clock is very nice and easy to switch mode.</li>
            <li>Very good and worth the money.</li>
            <li>This toothbrush is amazing.</li>
            <li>It cleans my teeth amazingly, but you may as well have a gas powered toothbrush with the amount of noise this thing makes.  </li>
            <li>This toothbrush is simply amazing.</li>
            <li>The Oral-B Triumph 5000 Electric Tooth brush has been an amazing product.</li>
            <li>Absolutely amazing.  </li>
            <li>This toothbrush is great, I see fantastic results.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s amazing</li>
            <li>This toothbrush is amazing.</li>
            <li>Amazon&#x27;s frustration free packaging was great - Oral-B needs to take some tips from them.  </li>
            <li>but I will say that I believe this 5000 is a nice improvement over the Triumph,  </li>
            <li>My family found the clock amusing.  </li>
            <li>I did want bristles that where longer like a do it yourself toothbrush but am very happy I tried it anyways because I really quite like what it came with.</li>
            <li>We now own two of these two brushes.  </li>
            <li>It comes with a nice travel case.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice practical touch to see the time when the timer is not running while brushing your teeth.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s nice</li>
            <li>Nice to have that in bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The carrying case is nice, too.</li>
            <li>I honestly can&#x27;t think of any cons...</li>
            <li>travel case is handy.</li>
            <li>You also don&#x27;t need it in order to travel with your toothbrush, which is nice.</li>
            <li>The timer is nice.</li>
            <li>Probably not but it does keep you honest if you try to brush for two minutes.  </li>
            <li>Have had an Oral B before and liked it a lot.</li>
            <li>As one person said, it does make a nice bathroom clock.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s nice to have a clock in the bathroom.</li>
            <li>One of the nice things about this unit is that it comes with a rechargeable battery.</li>
            <li>The battery powered display is also a nice addition</li>
            <li>It has been much more than great, it has been fantastic!  </li>
            <li>Ability to change the speed of the brush is nice.  </li>
            <li>I am totally loving it and have recommended it to all my friends.</li>
            <li>but I wanted to do my own research.  </li>
            <li>It also makes for a nice bathroom clock.</li>
            <li>/&gt;the screen is nice</li>
            <li>Plus its nice to change it up every now and then.</li>
            <li>The timer works really nicely, and it functions as a clock when you&#x27;re not brushing.</li>
            <li>and it is a nice feature.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This was a nice upgrade</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been great, and my last visit to the dentist was perfect.</li>
            <li>The timer is nice too.  </li>
            <li>I found the Oral-B effective in preventing that from happening.  </li>
            <li>It really is the best electric toothbrush I&#x27;ve had.</li>
            <li>I love getting a good cleaning in 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>and we each have our own brush heads.</li>
            <li>The travel case has been handy, but you have to remove the brush and store both pieces side by side in the case.</li>
            <li>Glad we saw all the good reviews and decided to try it.</li>
            <li>Effective at Oral Hygiene...</li>
            <li>This models is especially fun because of the clock.  </li>
            <li>The timer doubles as a handy bathroom clock.</li>
            <li>It honestly feels like I&#x27;ve been to the dentist each time I brush.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is amazingly effective.</li>
            <li>The wireless connection between the toothbrush and timer is handy.</li>
            <li>Great product, I think I will never come back to manual brushing. : )!!!!</li>
            <li>but he was thrilled.</li>
            <li>The toothbrush also has its own battery indicator (3 levels) --</li>
            <li>I own both toothbrushes, and here are the differences between the two:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The timer keeps you honest</li>
            <li>This thing really does the best job of brushing</li>
            <li>It is nice that there is a timer that comes with it.</li>
            <li>LIKED THE COMPACT SIZE--THE HANDY CLOCK</li>
            <li>It comes with a handy clock -</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s really handy to have in the bathroom when you are wondering what the time is;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s great - still working perfectly 2 years later</li>
            <li>The head fits nicely in the mouth and around each tooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have used a cybersonic for about 20 years and really liked it.....until it died.  </li>
            <li>Oral-B really is the best out there.</li>
            <li>If you have problem with receding gums, this indicator comes in handy.  </li>
            <li>I never had this kind of toothbrush before</li>
            <li>Keeps you honest</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really nice - keeps me brushing and brushing correctly.</li>
            <li>The time is cool and its easy to find the attachment/brush heads and it works great!!</li>
            <li>The pressure indicator is a great feature, I still haven&#x27;t changed the original head on the toothbrush yet, which it has been a while.</li>
            <li>It is worth it!!!</li>
            <li>Great Product and make my teeth feel so clean.</li>
            <li>It makes your mouth feel so clean, and the timer is a great feature.</li>
            <li>This is a great product to use for keeping your teeth clean and will reduce the time for the annual dentist cleaning.  </li>
            <li>Works great and makes my teeth feel really clean.  </li>
            <li>My teeth feel great - as clean as a dental cleaning!I</li>
            <li>This is an excellent machine, and I highly recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li>Best toothbush I have ever used, would highly recommend to all</li>
            <li>Highly recommended, and the Amazon.com \\&quot;Frustration Free\\&quot; packaging on this unit is a welcome addition!</li>
            <li>It works a treat and leaves ur teeth feeling dentist clean!!</li>
            <li>middle-of-the-road Oral-B toothbrush is probably fine for most folks, but if you catch this model on sale or with a rebate it should be a brush that your dentist is happy about you using.</li>
            <li>The new version has been tweaked and they are all for the best.</li>
            <li>It is an excellent product which keeps on improving with each new model.</li>
            <li>My Precision 5000 is my new best friend.  </li>
            <li>Heads are easy to switch and keeping a &#x27;good&#x27; brush head</li>
            <li>Works really good but still prefer the Sonic a bit better (more because of the brushes)</li>
            <li>It is easy to tell when you have done a good job brushing as well as you get a star rating when you turn the toothbrush</li>
            <li>The product came quickly and worked great.  </li>
            <li>The brush is easy to use, has superior cleaning power</li>
            <li>The monitor is very easy to read and follow.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s very easy to use.</li>
            <li>6 months.&lt;br /&gt;Overall good product if you are fine with spending almost 100 dollar on a tooth brush.</li>
            <li>i love how it tells you how well you clean your teeth and it works great.</li>
            <li>in all, I&#x27;m very impressed that Oral-B has continued the tradition of quality and performance that I had grown used to over the years with their older power toothbrush, and I am also pleased that they&#x27;ve improved on the performance of the power cells.</li>
            <li>in all, I&#x27;m very impressed that Oral-B has continued the tradition of quality and performance that I had grown used to over the years with their older power toothbrush, and I am also pleased that they&#x27;ve improved on the performance of the power cells.</li>
            <li>My first use was at night before bed and it cleaned me teeth amazingly, but the best part was that when I awoke in the morning, my teeth still felt really clean.  </li>
            <li>The way the brushhead moves is more effective, and I can see this is true.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Otherwise this is by far the best toothbrush I have owned</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s even fun to use and makes my teeth and gums feel great.</li>
            <li>I feel it does a great job cleaning and always leaves my mouth feeling fresh afterwards.  </li>
            <li>good price for  four differant settings enjoy</li>
            <li>The timer is also a nice reminder so I don&#x27;t spend more time on one area of teeth and neglect another area.</li>
            <li>but this is by far the best I have ever tried.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m so far impressed.</li>
            <li>Great product - Bit pricey but worth...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this product for about 2 months now and so far it&#x27;s worked great!  </li>
            <li>Still learning, but very happy with the results so far.  </li>
            <li>Wife said I wasn&#x27;t touching hers, so I purchased my own.  </li>
            <li>It just feels more effective.  </li>
            <li>I got this model to replace the Oral-B/Braun \\&quot;Triumph Professional Care\\&quot; (now discontinued version) toothbrush that I&#x27;ve been using for about 6 years now and that I&#x27;ve been very happy with.</li>
            <li>My dental hygienist is very, very happy with the way the Oral-B Professional 5000 is working for</li>
            <li>I liked it so much better than a tooth brush.</li>
            <li>The floss action isn&#x27;t as impressive as it sounds.  </li>
            <li>This is the best electric toothbrush i have had so far.</li>
            <li>The unit gives good performance and Amazon gave us the chance to purchase at a very economical price.</li>
            <li>It has a smoother and more pleasant sound as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Overall, a really good tooth brush and the battery life is very good.</li>
            <li>I love this toothbrush--it is effective and cleans much better than any others I have used.</li>
            <li>Works great and happy with the case for travel especially.</li>
            <li>This be good :) THANKS guys!!!</li>
            <li>This is my first electric toothbrush and I am so happy I made the purchase.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s twice as effective at cleaning than a manual toothbrush, and slightly more effective than Sonic Care (which I enjoy using.)</li>
            <li>Leaves teeth feeling super!!</li>
            <li>This is a very advanced way of brushing your teeth.  </li>
            <li>Very comfortable to hold in the hand.</li>
            <li>But I am loving this new model works great and the 5 options of speed is a plus.</li>
            <li>Easy to use, powerful, efficient, and cost-effective as well!!!</li>
            <li>He loved it so much he thought I paid much more for it!</li>
            <li>This Oral -B toothbrush was recommended to me and it certainly does a great job.</li>
            <li>Certainly i recommend this product for everyone, it do a great job in cleaning and whiting your teeth ,</li>
            <li>Very good brushing action.</li>
            <li>and we both agree that mine is better.</li>
            <li>My favorite part, if you brush for 2:30 the smiley face winks at you.</li>
            <li>They said it&#x27;s because I have more energy when I start and am more aggressive.  </li>
            <li>even the most stubborn</li>
            <li>We absolutely love it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>Overall, an excellent product.  </li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>It vibrates every 30 seconds to let you know you can do another part of your mouth (i.e., top row/front side, top row/back side, etc.).</li>
            <li>I did a lot of research before purchasing this, so I am fairly confident that it will work well</li>
            <li>I always go over the two minutes and brush more like four.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I always go over the two minutes and brush more like four.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love the sequence timer.  </li>
            <li>They explained this product could brush better than I could manually.</li>
            <li>After determining I was satisfied with this style brushhead I&#x27;ve ordered more.</li>
            <li>I recommend this brush, it&#x27;s a worthwhile investment.</li>
            <li>After so many uses and drying with a towel it began to peel off.</li>
            <li>/&gt;They also put a faster motor in the latest version.</li>
            <li>I read so many reviews before deciding which unit to purchase.</li>
            <li>Works better than described.</li>
            <li>Products are supposed to be better with the newer version</li>
            <li>I love this toothbrush system.</li>
            <li>The battery eventually wears out and I ordered the latest model.</li>
            <li>But now after a month I can tell gums are feeling better and looking better.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>If that sounds appealing then get a Sonicare.  </li>
            <li>However, this latest generation has regressed.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love the toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>Glad I paid the additional for that.</li>
            <li>I love this tooth brush.</li>
            <li>In my opinion this model is fantastic!  </li>
            <li>The results are much better than manual brushing.  </li>
            <li>An excellent product that I would definitely purchase again and have recommended to everyone in our family.</li>
            <li>Much better quality than cheaper versions our friends tried out.</li>
            <li>And then, the charging takes more than 12 hours (closer to 24)</li>
            <li>The toothbrush is awesome, the only drawback is that as I travel all the time, I had to buy an additional 220-110V adapter.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had the unit about 3 months now and love it.  </li>
            <li>Love this toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I love the clock/timer with its smiley face.</li>
            <li>I love everything about this toothbrush</li>
            <li>Overall, it works and I&#x27;m happy!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve enjoyed brushing more.  </li>
            <li>find that instead of using four quadrants I break it up into two (top and bottom)</li>
            <li>I find that that works better for</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m satisfied</li>
            <li>I love the preasure sensor.</li>
            <li>To summarize, I&#x27;m really glad I sprang for the 5,000 series.</li>
            <li>Love this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>This one takes more like 12 hours.</li>
            <li>I am enjoying the Precision 5000</li>
            <li>I really love it.</li>
            <li>I love that I can adjust the speed.</li>
            <li>Love the timer feature and the travel case.</li>
            <li>battery is excellent, it will hold a charge for several weeks, so the brush doesn&#x27;t need to be stored on the battery charger.  </li>
            <li>I got mine through my Dentist and love it.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Better feel, better balance.  </li>
            <li>My husband and I bought this set from our dentist and we love it.</li>
            <li>After using it a while I can say it was a worthwhile</li>
            <li>My dentist has told me for years that a power brush does a better job cleaning your teeth than a manual</li>
            <li>Absolutely love this Oral B.  </li>
            <li>I came across this one on Amazon, accidentally, and it sounded interesting.</li>
            <li>I love this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>LOVE this toothbrush.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so much more efficient than brushing your teeth manually.</li>
            <li>I drink coffee and tea and wanted a better way to keep my teeth from staining.</li>
            <li>Guess whose dentist was pleased with the upkeep between cleanings?  </li>
            <li>I love that the timer is connected to the toothbrush and that it comes with a travel case.  </li>
            <li>Have only had it for 2 recharges but have been very happy with it.</li>
            <li>i love that there is a time too.  </li>
            <li>Way better than the Phillips.  </li>
            <li>Love the circular rotation, it does make you feel like you have just come from dentist.</li>
            <li>and I love it...</li>
            <li>I just love my electric toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>We have used Oral-B electric toothbrushes for many years.</li>
            <li>I will know more when I get my teeth cleaned at the dentist.</li>
            <li>When spending $90+ for a toothbrush, I think there should be better customer service.</li>
            <li>Go with the top of the line 5000, its $50 more than the starter model but that is inexpensive vs the yearly +$100 for dental cleaning.</li>
            <li>This is a fabulous product!  </li>
            <li>I have handicapped hands love this</li>
            <li>I like the fact that the Oral-B handle is better sealed than the Sonicare</li>
            <li>the charger was ok</li>
            <li>This Oral-B product is superbly designed and is appropriate for a maximum of four users (if each uses only one toothbrush).  </li>
            <li>I always go beyond the two minute mark, but I am confident that I haven&#x27;t undercleaned.  </li>
            <li>I love this unit.  </li>
            <li>I was amazed at how much better it cleaned my teeth than the Sonicare</li>
            <li>use the &amp;#34;gentle&amp;#34; setting on the Oral-B, with a sensitive brush head, and my gums, along with my teeth, feel incredible.  </li>
            <li>I love all the features of this brush.</li>
            <li>More &amp;#34;Yugo&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;Geo Metro&amp;#34; than &amp;#34;Mercedes&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;2)</li>
            <li>If the wireless sensor was waterproof for the shower that would be even better.</li>
            <li>I have really enjoyed using this product.  </li>
            <li>Thanks oral-b for the great toothbrush with the included clock and heads.</li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>I purchased it not quite sure if I would like it more than Sonicare, but wiling to give it a chance.    </li>
            <li>As a bonus, brush head replacements are much more affordable than Sonicare replacement brush heads.    </li>
            <li>I love the brush head options.</li>
            <li>but I would expect more elaborate statistics and information from this output screen.</li>
            <li>However, it does feel as though there is significantly more movement on the tooth surface.</li>
            <li>Absolutely love this toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I went for the Precision 5000 because of the reviews on Amazon were mostly positive.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Love, love, love this product.</li>
            <li>and I love it....</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t imagine anything more I&#x27;d want out of a toothbrush.</li>
            <li>We love this product.</li>
            <li>Really does a great job at making my mouth feel cleaner.</li>
            <li>have recommended this device for more than three years and I am continually amazed at results my patients are getting.  </li>
            <li>But anyway it&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li>like it, love it.</li>
            <li>I would gladly recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li>I use 2 modes at most.</li>
            <li>The display doesn&#x27;t tell you any more than is communicated by the brush handles&#x27; pauses and beeps.  </li>
            <li>So, my gums are better also.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this toothbrush for about two years now and have enjoyed it.</li>
            <li>a business perspective the company has created an ingenious model.</li>
            <li>You will not be able to replace it with ease or without a soldering kit.</li>
            <li>- More brushing programs / options&lt;br</li>
            <li>The brush itself feels more sturdy, and</li>
            <li>As a Oral-B Triumph 9900 user and a longtime Sonicare user prior to that, I was very impressed with the Oral-B Precision 5000.</li>
            <li>I like this brush just as well and love the travel case that comes with it.</li>
            <li>but I do like watching the included timer to make sure I am giving all portions of my mouth its 30 seconds per quadrant.</li>
            <li>Having never written a review before for any product, I am not at all intimidated because this is such a wonderful invention.</li>
            <li>I did some research and found that the Oral-B was the number one top rated teeth cleaning system over-all.</li>
            <li>I purchased one and my teeth have never felt better.</li>
            <li>A WINNER....... will buy again for sure...</li>
            <li>Money well invested :)</li>
            <li>I am so pleased with my choice.</li>
            <li>It better than the Soni care.</li>
            <li>and it was mostly a maze of pre-recorded messages (which made me wonder why those messages couldn&#x27;t play during the weekend).  </li>
            <li>The display timer also helps me make sure I&#x27;m thorough.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The 2 minute cycle is divided into four sections which I use to concentrate on each section of my teeth, making sure to hit all surfaces in the 30 seconds per section.  </li>
            <li>also love the improved tray to protect the brush heads.</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t sure I needed, or wanted,</li>
            <li>So glad I bit the bullet and went for it.  </li>
            <li>I was hoping for more spin.</li>
            <li>The product is well made, charges fast, and works great.  </li>
            <li>I love how my mouth feels after I use it.  </li>
            <li>otherwise it is better than mannual brushing.</li>
            <li>We love this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>love the flossing feature especially,as well as the timing.</li>
            <li>I just love  everything about this toothbrush</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a worthwhile investment.</li>
            <li>I am so glad I got this.</li>
            <li>OK, again 1st the caveats.</li>
            <li>If you are used to most any electric toothbrush, you will love this puppy.</li>
            <li>This has worked so much better for us.  </li>
            <li>I really love it.  </li>
            <li>I really enjoyed it a lot.  </li>
            <li>My teeth had never look better and cleaner.</li>
            <li>However, this is overkill for most people who do not need a star system in order to brush their teeth.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The manual could use some more clarity.  </li>
            <li>- this is a toothbrush of the highest quality with the most features.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Oral-B electric toothbrushes for many years.</li>
            <li>but I really love all of the features.</li>
            <li>but it helps me brush better and longer.</li>
            <li>It takes more than 24 hours to recharge fully.  </li>
            <li>You&#x27;re not going to find an electric toothbrush better than Oral-B.</li>
            <li>Much better than the battery operated toothbrushed.</li>
            <li>(it&#x27;s lighter and pressure-warning red-light has much more convenient place now) and just one issue.</li>
            <li>I love the Oral-B Precision 5000.</li>
            <li>the management system functions are a bit over the top, but if one needed that level of guidance, I guess it better be there?&lt;br</li>
            <li>, I love it, I want some more of it&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt; Tim M.&lt;br</li>
            <li>, I love it, I want some more of it&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt; Tim M.</li>
            <li>This my favorite tool.</li>
            <li>Time will tell whether I love it or not.  </li>
            <li>I bought this toothbrush for my family , they are so pleased with it ..</li>
            <li>I also wish there was more info on children and electric toothbrushes.</li>
            <li>This is the 3rd (and best) Oral-B I&#x27;ve used over the years.  </li>
            <li>I love the ease of use and the multi brushing levels.  </li>
            <li>Finally the travel option is wonderful.</li>
            <li>Probably better for the battery though.</li>
            <li>I already got one of these through my dentist office and I love mine.</li>
            <li>They are more manageable in the mouth and are a lot easier on the gums.  </li>
            <li>It is so lovely having a printer do what it should do without coaxing.  </li>
            <li>5 stars! :)</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>I love a toothbrush that does ALL the work for me.  </li>
            <li>I am totally satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gotta cost more too</li>
            <li>Love this model.  </li>
            <li>All the many features make it a thorough tooth cleaning device.  </li>
            <li>I love the pressure sensor.  </li>
            <li>Not something that many might ask for</li>
            <li>the extra timer is excellent to have as a clock in the bathroom when you are not brushing your teeth.</li>
            <li>Probably not.&lt;br /&gt;  Love the timer too.</li>
            <li>station&lt;br /&gt;everthing is ok.  </li>
            <li>All of them lasted many years.</li>
            <li>I love the product .My</li>
            <li>I did not switch over many years before.</li>
            <li>For me, the tray is not helpful, but it could be if more than one person uses the toothbrush so that everybody can fit their own head on it when they brush.</li>
            <li>So glad I bought the Oral B toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>Now, there is more of a noticeable stop after each 30 seconds (though it&#x27;s just a split</li>
            <li>I sure am glad I did.  </li>
            <li>Makes me want to go and brush my teeth. :)</li>
            <li>It seems I received a lemon in the original brush, as this replacement is awesome, even more than when I first bought the original brush.</li>
            <li>I Absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>So, I went to Best Buy and purchased the same version and did a comparison.</li>
            <li>However, this toothbrush does an excellent job way beyond the results I was gettilng with my regular toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>It exceeds my expectations, and I love it.</li>
            <li>I love the brush and the clock</li>
            <li>This latest, the 5000, replaces my Plaque Remover 3D.  </li>
            <li>I love this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>It will provide you with a bonus star (5-stars in all) if you brush for an additional 30 seconds or more.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better than advertised.</li>
            <li>and I love the timer.</li>
            <li>Many emails and phone calls resulted with me sending.</li>
            <li>It really does a great job cleaning your teeth.  </li>
            <li>I love the &amp;#34;fresh from the dentist&amp;#34; feel after using this.  </li>
            <li>:)  </li>
            <li>so I bet this toothbrush would encourage better children brushing as well.  </li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>This will save you money to buy more heads.</li>
            <li>Since it has been recommended by dentists it makes this purchase better.</li>
            <li>They love theirs too.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I love this tooth brush.</li>
            <li>but now i have a clock in my bathroom.  : )</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m really pleased.</li>
            <li>However, I am prepared to put up with a bit more noise if it does what it is supposed to do.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t matter how many times a day I flossed, it would continually build up.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using these Oral B brushes for many years and have had better checkups with these than I had years ago using the Sonicare product.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I listened.  </li>
            <li>but I kept smiling just to see my teeth :)</li>
            <li>love the travel case.  </li>
            <li>would recommend this to anyone wanting better oral hygiene.</li>
            <li>I am enjoying this Oral B.</li>
            <li>guess Eastern engineering is now better than that found in Merkel</li>
            <li>This cleans much better</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>This is a great buy and makes your teeth so clean and helps so much if you have gum disease!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve used this product for over 2 months and it still feels great and gives you plenty of power to give a clean and powerful brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So far I am ver impressed with the quality of clean that the product provides.  </li>
            <li>If it seems like I&#x27;m a bit over appreciative consider that when you go almost a month without being able to take a shower yet your teeth feel amazingly clean</li>
            <li>I used to own the older version of this toothbrush and loved it.</li>
            <li>Using your favorite toothpaste, The Oral-B will leave your mouth feeling very clean.  </li>
            <li>I really like the timer too!!!!</li>
            <li>The teeth never felt better, great product that I can highly recommend.  </li>
            <li>I find it gives me a nice clean feel and</li>
            <li>,it works great and its highly quality toothbrush, i had the triumph before and it works 4 years</li>
            <li>Highly recommended, and the Amazon.com \\&quot;Frustration Free\\&quot; packaging on this unit is a welcome addition!compliment to the Oral-B design as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is a great product and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>My teeth fill very clean after use.</li>
            <li>The brush head makes my teeth feel very clean.</li>
            <li>For 6 months it worked well and my teeth felt very clean after brushing.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, it gets my teeth very clean.</li>
            <li>You get a very clean feel.</li>
            <li>My teeth feel very clean when I am done using it.  </li>
            <li>My teeth feel very clean after each use.</li>
            <li>Also, the toothbrush seems to stay very clean, provided you remove the brush and rinse it after each session.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall I think this is a pretty good toothbrush.</li>
            <li>#34;sparkle&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;The timer is an awesome way of telling how long you have been brushing.</li>
            <li>This toothbrush gives a good cleaning and is exactly as described.</li>
            <li>These brushes are great quality; they last forever, and do a nice job of keeping your teeth and gums healthy.</li>
            <li>Each lasted a long time and I was very happy with it.</li>
            <li>The clock/timer thing is really handy because I can guarantee you don&#x27;t brush for a full two minutes.</li>
            <li>I actually loved it from the first time that I used it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not disappointed!</li>
            <li>I had been looking for a very long time for the best rechargeable electric  toothbrush I could find.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Defineatly a worthwhile investment and a strong recommendation to buy.  </li>
            <li>and it still holds a good charge for several weeks and maintains good stroke power.&lt;br</li>
            <li>it comes with works very well and makes sure you do a good job cleaning.</li>
            <li>, so it&#x27;s very easy to clean.</li>
            <li>, battery lasts about a week on a single charge, and the best argument, no cavities and I was complimented by the hygienist.</li>
            <li>However, it is the single best toothbrush I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>Talk about squeaky clean teeth!  </li>
            <li>What can you say about Oral B except they clean the teeth of America!</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m sure they will be fine.</li>
            <li>My teeth feel just as clean as when I go to the dentist!</li>
            <li>Way easier to clean the holder now!</li>
            <li>My teeth haven&#x27;t felt so clean!</li>
            <li>It works so well, that the hygienist keeps asking how I keep my teeth so clean!  </li>
            <li>Great toothbrush, compatible with a wide series of brush heads, holds a charge well, comes with a good traveling case, easy to operate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The smart guide helps with brushing and the clock is good if you need to see the time.</li>
            <li>It gets my teeth very clean and is easy to move around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>very cool.  </li>
            <li>Overall, a very good buy.</li>
            <li>That is extremely useful because it is very easy to spend more time on one part of your mouth than another.</li>
            <li>This is a great toothbrush--timer makes me brush full two minutes and my mouth feels clean and fresh.</li>
            <li>and I feel more comfortable talking to people</li>
            <li>/&gt;There are many options of brush replacements available.  </li>
            <li>Now, I have his old one which I use for my jewelry cleaning and it works great</li>
            <li>The brush itself is great and nearly identical to what I had.  </li>
            <li>Great find on Amazon as far as the pricing as I saved over $45 on this unit from the price my dentist was quoting from his office.</li>
            <li>great upgrade from our old one.  </li>
            <li>I have used those cheap 10 dollar electric toothbrushes for many years.</li>
            <li>The toothbrush works great so far.</li>
            <li>My dentist suggested and had a great deal on an Oral B Professional Precision 5000.</li>
            <li>Along with flossing and mouthwash, the floss action heads work great.  </li>
            <li>far as the 5000 model goes, the brush itself and case holder are great.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m happy to report the Professional 5000 lives up to all of&lt;br /&gt;the claims made in the ads.  </li>
            <li>Great replacement for my old Oral B brush.  </li>
            <li>Great electric tooth brush I purchased to replace an old Oral B that lasted over 15 years.  </li>
            <li>I was going to review it soon after I bought it, but decided to wait because in my opinion, the real worth of a toothbrush of this nature is shown after using if for quite a while.  </li>
            <li>This is a fairly pricey toothbrush and I struggled with spending so much money for it.</li>
            <li>A push type reel mower will cut the grass but it really doesn&#x27;t do as good a job as a power mower.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The carry case is nice, but I don&#x27;t find the brush holder useful.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really that good.  </li>
            <li>Good teeth become much appreciated with the expanding years.  </li>
            <li>This is a great tool for your teeth, easy to use,  Love the rechargeable battery, way better than the regular batteries, I don&#x27;t use the timer/clock thought..</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and my mouth feels really clean!</li>
            <li>This brush in particular does a very effective job and has very useful speeds.  </li>
            <li>This toothbrush has strong action and feels like it does a great job.</li>
            <li>Product seems great when cleaning, but the batteries die SUPER fast.</li>
            <li>My original review is wildly enthusiastic about a great product - however, over several months&#x27; use, I found the \\&quot;Floss</li>
            <li>Wow what a very nice improvement.</li>
            <li>The brush heads are unique, and seem more customized to teeth.</li>
            <li>brush heads are interchangeable with other Oral-B toothbrushes, which is awesome!</li>
            <li>After I compared it to other leading brands I found this one to be the best for what my dentist wanted and the price and value.  </li>
            <li>I used to roll my eyes when they said that in commercials, but now I see it&#x27;s true!</li>
            <li>perfect for getting the little ones to brush for two minutes, sometimes more.  </li>
            <li>One of our best purchases, providing excellant oral care .Considering additional puchases for other family members.</li>
            <li>I always brush the full time!  </li>
            <li>The power cord has a piece of Velcro attached to it for easy storage.  </li>
            <li>I like the Oral B Healthy Clean.  </li>
            <li>If it shows 2:05, that&#x27;s no guarantee that brushing technique was ideal, but it&#x27;s at least one reassurance that good habits are taking hold.</li>
            <li>Had the previous version and loved it and this does as good or better work.</li>
            <li>My teeth even remain more clean throughout the day between brushing; and even after about 2-3 days of use</li>
            <li>This one is easy to set up and use.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s compact, easy to use and</li>
            <li>The monitor can be stored on the shelf or mounted on the wall using a holder that supplied with the kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The travel case makes it easy to take this when I</li>
            <li>These items aside, it does a wonderful job of cleaning my teeth and they are much cleaner than they ever were with my old unit.  </li>
            <li>Now I realize that it cups each tooth to clean better.</li>
            <li>Does a much better job keeping teeth clean than manual brushing.</li>
            <li>It is better to get the head out from time to time, and clean up everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great at cleaning, easier to use than its predecessor, and more versatile than prior models.</li>
            <li>Whats not to love - makes your teeth feel dentist clean.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and</li>
            <li>/&gt;- discharges very quickly</li>
            <li>Easy to use and cleans well.</li>
            <li>My hygienist complimented me on my clean healthy teeth and gums since using this and water pic.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to use and the machine hints ensure a thorough cleaning.</li>
            <li>Easy to setup &amp; use.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use and operate.  </li>
            <li>So far, I really like this over my Sonic, plus my dentist says this is the best, so I got one.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is an easy to use toothbrush that helps me keep brushing for the correct amount of time.</li>
            <li>Also it is easy to take with me when traveling.</li>
            <li>My teeth feel even more clean than when I use a manual toothbrush.</li>
            <li>The storage case makes it easy to travel with as well.</li>
            <li>Easy to use</li>
            <li>Easy to use and</li>
            <li>love the way my teeth feels.. clean</li>
            <li>I find this easy to use.  </li>
            <li>i love how clean my teeth are.</li>
            <li>Have found I really dont need so many speed variations, but they are nice to have.</li>
            <li>The Duracell batteries that comes with the set is still going strong after almost a month.  </li>
            <li>Strong recommendation.</li>
            <li>Comfortable to use, and you can tell its worth the money with how effective it</li>
            <li>Well, with this product at least.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like the features that help you brush more effectively.</li>
            <li>Its still going strong.</li>
            <li>The guide book has easy to read text and good diagrams that make it easy to assemble, use and clean the toothbrush and smart guide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re new to rechargeable toothbrushes, the vibrations take some getting used to, but you get one heck of a clean!!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Granted, I don&#x27;t have much to compare it to besides the old-fashioned, archaic, manual toothbrush, but I&#x27;m very satisfied</li>
            <li>It cleans my teeth nicely and is very convenient!</li>
            <li>I also own a Sonicare toothbrush that I bought when my first Braun died</li>
            <li>So this is hands down the best toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
            <li>This new one is even better than the first one does a great job.</li>
            <li>And now when my bracket for the smart guide broke and I called to try to purchase another one, they said they do not sell them?!!?!</li>
            <li>It performs excellently and the remote indicator is so cool</li>
            <li>This is my second electric toothbrush and I must say I&#x27;m pretty impressed.</li>
            <li>, it worked perfectly for 110 or 120&amp;#62; I thought I was choosing the same exactly model</li>
            <li>and Im pretty sure the my dental bill will be happier :)</li>
            <li>Meets my expectations and does a fine job of cleaning my teeth.</li>
            <li>And it quickly failed.&lt;br /&gt;You would think P &amp; G would do a better job.</li>
            <li>These stay accessible, clean, and I keep better track of my supply.</li>
            <li>/clock on it was a bit much when I first opened the package, but I can now honestly say it comes in handy while brushing.  </li>
            <li>The Oral B system uses brush heads that easily slip on and off the brush and the system includes a tray for each brush head - making it easy to remove, clean and store between brushes.</li>
            <li>Finally, the unit is well weighted, ergonomically functional, and has a more pleasant noise than the Sonicare.</li>
            <li>too strong for my sensitive teeth but a good product.</li>
            <li>This one is easy to handle, has the 4 beeps to indicate when you&#x27;ve finished brushing each quadrant of your mouth, brushing is (so far) effective (certainly more so than a manual brush) and has a traveling case.  </li>
            <li>&quot; I think the Smart Guide is a handy reminder to assist you in spending the correct amount of time on each quadrant of your mouth.</li>
            <li>If you do it for two minutes you will see a little happy face!</li>
            <li>VERY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!</li>
            <li>wished it came with 2 brushes to give one to my husband or I could order a replacement to use same charger and smart guide but this does not affect the awesome toothbrush at all</li>
            <li>/&gt;Customer service was very quick to resolve the original rebate issue I posted.</li>
            <li>I had previously owned a cheaper Sonic brush, and my dentist strongly recommended that I buy Oral-B since the technology is simply better and more effective - and I agree!  </li>
            <li>toothbrush cleans very good, that is why I give 1 star, but it will destroy your gums and bone.&lt;br /&gt;I will recomend much more the Sonicare toothbrushes.</li>
            <li>It is hard to imagine a better toothbrush, and the Amazon price is awesome.  </li>
            <li>The battery display on the toothbrush is always extremely accurate and lets me know</li>
            <li>Having the indicator, which seems fairly accurate, is nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>.. enjoy your product but do not expect to get a mail-in-rebate money....  </li>
            <li>So I am overall happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li>Also, it is nice to have a clock in the bathroom and it doesn&#x27;t take up much space.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more powerful than I planned.</li>
            <li>This thing does it all and the digital timer greatly helps</li>
            <li>Virtually no cleaning to do and the heads snap on smooth as silk.  </li>
            <li>I actually enjoy and look forward to using this product every day.  </li>
            <li>Absolutely fantastic.</li>
            <li>only downside would be the batteries - They aren&#x27;t great - maybe get 6-8 days of battery life (using 2x a day).  </li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t really do much except tell the time, honestly.</li>
            <li>I finally had to replace my old Oral-B after MANY years of excellent cleaning.</li>
            <li>Fantastic.  </li>
            <li>Sure, it&#x27;s pricey, but heck, I&#x27;m worth it...</li>
            <li>/&gt;Very easy to clean handle, stand, recharger and brush tray.</li>
            <li>and I think I will have great results at my next dental check-up.  </li>
            <li>Overall, it does a great job cleaning your teeth.  </li>
            <li>It easily rinses clean when I am done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>( the indicator light gone off)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also engaging.</li>
            <li>This is a fabulous toothbrushing system.  </li>
            <li>Made a great Christmas present.</li>
            <li>yes, but worth every penny and more.  </li>
            <li>The extra features are great as well.  </li>
            <li>cheap looking travel case.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The brush is great, I&#x27;d definitely recommend it....</li>
            <li>The motor makes a sort of grinding sound</li>
            <li>It works great and is so simple to use.  </li>
            <li>And Amazon had it delivered to my door in a few days which worked out great!!!</li>
            <li>So, still a great brush but keep the relatively short lifetime in mind as you consider the price.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Nothing but great things to say about this product, and you especially can&#x27;t beat Amazon&#x27;s prices and service.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;Electric brush maintenance and cleaning is important.</li>
            <li>It said service was available Mon-Fri from like 9A-6P.  </li>
            <li>Went to the Dentist last week and had a great check up.</li>
            <li>Shaves close, leaves skin feeling smooth with no cuts or nicks..</li>
            <li>short, I like both the Sonicare and the Oral B as each have their own advantages and disadvantages but both are excellent toothbrushes and a big upgrade from manual..  </li>
            <li>short, I like both the Sonicare and the Oral B as each have their own advantages and disadvantages but both are excellent toothbrushes and a big upgrade from manual.</li>
            <li>In this kit you get one free brush head(it&#x27;s the flossing one)</li>
            <li>This spin brush is great, solidly built with additional features.</li>
            <li>this point I think the 5000 is well worth the price and am glad I bought it.</li>
            <li>My opinion will be more useful after I print off a couple of reams of paper.  </li>
            <li>I like the five brushing modes that are available</li>
            <li>All the modes feel comfortable to use.  </li>
            <li>a quarter of the circle around the smiling face is filled in letting the user know</li>
            <li>One of the stars on the smartguide is then filled</li>
            <li>We purchased it for our own use and find it very satisfactory</li>
            <li>I am able to just stand in the shower and wake up while my mouth becomes minty fresh.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a different technology, but I am happy with it.  </li>
            <li>that&#x27;s smooth like just being to the dentist for a polishing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After a couple weeks of using this toothbrush, I really enjoy it.</li>
            <li>Packaging is indeed frustration free.</li>
            <li>They are gifts for my parents, and they enjoy using this &amp;#34;professional&amp;#34; tooth brush.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>very usable and love the brush, really cleans by 73 year old teeth and keeps them in great shape!</li>
            <li>It does sound like a caterpillar tractor is excavating when brushing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not as comfortable to use as the Sonicare was.</li>
            <li>If I had kids, especially with braces etc, what a great tooth brush.  </li>
            <li>and I experienced the same problem with both.  </li>
            <li>It is just fantastic the family loves it two&lt;br /&gt;Lyn</li>
            <li>I loved the soft bristles on there</li>
            <li>However, the timer was kind of unecessary, although pretty cool.</li>
            <li>It does a good job of brushing along with floss action.</li>
            <li>The best brush I have ever used, it has a timer and it make you aware of how long you are spending on cleaning your teeth correctly,</li>
            <li>, This will get you more ladies when they see your good smelling breath and white teeth.</li>
            <li>so far so good.</li>
            <li>The toothbrush itself makes sure you&#x27;re brushing at the appropriate proximity to your teeth without applying too much pressure.</li>
            <li>This toothbrush is really good with multiple settings and we love the timer.</li>
            <li>so far so good.</li>
            <li>One thing that surprised me was that it felt good on my gums.</li>
            <li>Ever since the purchase of the Oral-B Professional Health + Floss Action Precision 5000, my check-ups at the dentist have been excellent.</li>
            <li>She feels that the rotary motion is far superior to the sonic waves.  </li>
            <li>I was looking for a Sonic Care, then a WaterPik, and finally I found this to be the best all-around electric toothbrush and decided to make the purchase.</li>
            <li>I have owned several Electric Tooth Brushes but this was the absolute best.</li>
            <li>Its a good toothbrush very powerful than my old OralB. worked well</li>
            <li>Very nice complex with timer (and time) and good brush.</li>
            <li>My husband and I both use this new toothbrush and are very satisfied with it.</li>
            <li>And it helps make sure he brushes the right way.</li>
            <li>However, it&#x27;s a significant improvement on the old model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s easy to see right out of the box and after the first charge that it has much more power, which is a welcome change.</li>
            <li>Sense\\&quot; without these features I&#x27;d be brushing my teeth incorrectly with a very powerful</li>
            <li>so basically in a few more months, wont charge at all!!!</li>
            <li>The diagram on the timer really does make me aware of each quadrant of my mouth, so I brush more effectively than I used to.</li>
            <li>other point that I would like to make here is that this particular toothbrush is considered the very best by our dentist and probably as well as most dentists out there.  </li>

            <li>Teeth feel clean and smooth like a dental cleaning.  </li>

            <li>powerful, teeth feel really clean on all surfaces and in between!</li>
            <li>It was worth the money because now my teeth feel dentist clean all the time!</li>

            <li>I chose this model because of the rating,and was not disappointed.  </li>
            <li>Unique how this thing times you as you brush your teeth</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s well built and user friendly.  </li>
            <li>I normally brush for over thirty seconds in each section (and I have my own way of brushing) and I don&#x27;t like the way the brush pauses to indicate that its time to move on.  </li>
            <li>I received this toothbrush thru the Amazon Vine program, and reviewed it on the original product page.</li>
            <li>You are worth it!</li>
            <li>reasons why this product got 4 and not 5 stars are listed below in my original review.&lt;br /&gt;------------------------------------------------------------&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have purchased three of these, one for me and two others as gifts, and as far as I know, the recipients have been very satisfied with the gifts.</li>

            <li>Worth every penny!</li>

            <li>This one works even better than the first.</li>
            <li>Makes it almost fun!</li>
            <li>I know they require my original receipt (which I can&#x27;t find) in order to do \\&quot;in warranty service\\&quot;</li>

            <li>it&#x27;s worth the money!</li>
            <li>Love it exact model I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never needed anything more than the first mode</li>

            <li>I&#x27;m replacing one of the original 2 speed brushes.</li>
            <li>Original brush does not work for teeth.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have been using and enjoying an Oral-B Triumph toothbrush for several years; which worked flawlessly until recently.  </li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t wait to brush again to change it to a smile!  </li>
            <li>This product is worth writing about!  </li>
            <li>Worth the price!</li>
            <li>Who knew I&#x27;d be so excited about a toothbrush?  </li>
            <li>I would have given it a higher rating if I was able to clean my tongue thoroughly.</li>
            <li>My teeth feel so clean when I am finished brushing.</li>
            <li>My teeth are whiter and feel as clean as when I go to the dentist.  </li>

            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this brush for the better part of a month and for the most part, it&#x27;s identical to the [[ASIN:B004O76DEC Oral-B Professional Care SmartSeries 5000]</li>
            <li>Call me simple, but I love having the 30-second reminders to switch zones when I am brushing and the smiley face when you hit two minutes is a nice way to start the day.</li>
            <li>an this prevents that and gets my teeth totally clean.  </li>
            <li>i just don&#x27;t feel like my teeth are clean unless i have an electric toothbrush.</li>

            <li>I bought this toothbrush because my dentist said I needed to get a &amp;#34;deeper&amp;#34; clean on my teeth and gums.  </li>
            <li>office clean.  </li>
            <li>To date I have only tried the floss action head which I like, but I having the option to use any brush head great!</li>
            <li>Your teeth will still feel clean even after you&#x27;ve eaten.</li>
            <li>The timer is an important addition, helps tremendously with uniformity of brushing.  </li>
            <li>Oral hygienist told me she wishes every patient had a clean mouth like mine and I attribute that to this tooth brush.</li>
            <li>It took hours of frustration to get the unit almost sorta clean.</li>
            <li>My teeth never felt totally clean.</li>
            <li>and I can tell when he misses places as the areas that are clean &amp;</li>

            <li>It makes my teeth feel so so clean.</li>
            <li>(Also, the Sonicare seemed to fling more dental detritus onto the bathroom mirror which was kind of gross.)</li>
            <li>He has never seen my teeth so clean.  </li>
            <li>My teeth feel clean and after 5 days of use</li>
            <li>Now you just need to clean the base.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I always felt that my teeth just doesn&#x27;t get the feeling of being clean.</li>
            <li>It vibrates a lot more than my old one, and I can tell it is cleaning my teeth better.  </li>
            <li>and the hygienist commented on how clean my teeth were.  </li>
            <li>It gives me a feeling of clean that a manual toothbrush just doesn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li>My teeth feel so clean</li>
            <li>To my pleasant surprise, he uses this same one based on his research.</li>
            <li>Would be great for a single person.</li>
            <li>I have been very pleased with the cleaning action of the head on the Oral-B design for 6 years now, and since this one works just the same way, though with a bit more power, I&#x27;m confident I&#x27;ll be as happy with this one as with the last.</li>
            <li>I feel like it is much better at cleaning my teeth and the separate timer is better at motivating me to complete the full two minutes of brushing.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really need a smiley face that lights up when I complete a quadrant of my mouth, but I think that a children&#x27;s version of this would be great; it would keep kids motivated to brush for a full two minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have owned it for two months thus far and love it!</li>
            <li>It seems pretty strong and decent coverage, but not as nice as the cordura semi-rigid cases they used to give you.</li>
            <li>It has some really great features to ensure that you brush properly and for the right amount of time.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard to get excited about a toothbrush, this is hands-down the best toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a pretty minor issue, but I liked having more grades of battery life and being able to see the charge level without turning the toothbrush on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The original Oral-B electric toothbrush I used, while effective, had to be replaced when it stopped recharging completely.  </li>
            <li>We also notice our teeth are getting whiter without any special treatment or whitening toothpaste.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Even if your dentist does not sell the kit, I recommend this toothbrush for folks who need flexibility and/or have special needs.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure they were the 1,000 series, but I can&#x27;t be certain.</li>
            <li>love the smart guide.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if Oral-b had it made special or if it is a off-the-shelf product for Braun.  </li>
            <li>Got this on a special sale.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been able to get the smart guide screen to come on, but I don&#x27;t feel that is a problem.  </li>
            <li>I feel as though I made the right choice!  </li>
            <li>I feel like I am out of the dentist&#x27;s chair every morning after brushing my teeth with the Oral-B Professional Healthy Clean (precision clean head)!</li>
            <li>They make a HUGE difference in the appearance of your smile and how clean your teeth stay between visits to the Dentist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>you absolutely MUST make sure that the motor is clean after each use.</li>
            <li>, I still have all my own teeth, a decent smile, etc.</li>
            <li>This product really get you teeth clean and gets your gums into tip top shape.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Other than that, I would recommend this brush to anyone who wants to attain a clean, healthy mouth.</li>
            <li>I just received my Oral B 5000, was excited to receive it so quick.</li>
            <li>This replaced a very high end Sonicare, and I really am pleased with the change.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;please full charge before use</li>
            <li>You get 20 brushes per full charge (10 days - 2x per day).  </li>
            <li>You get 20 brushes per full charge (10 days - 2x per day).  </li>
            <li>but this one is far more powerful and the options offer much more</li>
            <li>and then  I recharged it in full, then removed from charger.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is kind of loud.</li>
            <li>Used these for years, but battery will only hold a good charge for about 2 years.  </li>
            <li>It really does an outstanding job of cleaning your teeth.  </li>
            <li>When this happens, there is no way to tell whether the toothbrush is charging and when it has a full charge.    </li>
            <li>my teeth were noticeably whiter now than they&#x27;ve ever been, and having used it regularly for a month or so now they look almost as good as when I leave the doctors chair.</li>
            <li>I bought this after wanting to upgrade from my old electric toothbrush and my fiance has since stolen it and is using it as his own.</li>
            <li>It makes me feel that I have to give the teeth a full brushing, even when I am in a hurry to get to bed at night</li>
            <li>(it keeps me from cheating my teeth out of a full brushing).  </li>
            <li>Overall a good product.  </li>
            <li>, I brush my teeth for the full 2 minutes instead of just 1 minute.  </li>
            <li>I feel my teeth are super clean</li>
            <li>The visual guides on the monitor are good teaching aids.</li>
            <li>It has a good power motor and cleans your teeth well enough.</li>
            <li>Love the timer lets you know if you are applying to much pressure.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d venture to say that I seldom (if ever) used to brush my teeth for a full 2 minutes before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>A full charge for me lasts about 4-5 days.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Still loving brush action.</li>
            <li>It has replaceable heads and because of this my husband and I share it, which really makes it even better.</li>
            <li>B003UKM9CO Precision 1000]] already has four 30-seconds reminders to switch between different parts of your mouth (remember 2 minutes is the optimum time to brush),</li>
            <li>It does such a good cleaning that flossing is a breeze.</li>
            <li>(That is cool.</li>
            <li>Do take note that this toothbrush requires a full 24 hour charge before using, and I have found that even with just me using it twice a day for 2-3 minutes each time, it requires a full recharge every 5 - 6 days.</li>
            <li>Thanks to Amazon Vine, I have since upgraded to the 5000 thousand model, and I love it.</li>
            <li>I will recommend this product to anyone who wants to have healthy teeth.</li>
            <li>and I finally got it at Amazon for a really good price.</li>
            <li>Love the toothbrush, very efficient brushing, pauses when it&#x27;s time to change quadrants.</li>
            <li>Overall, a good toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I love using it and feel my teeth and gums are  much cleaner.  </li>
            <li>With this product you will definitely get what you pay for because it is ultra superior to manual brushing.</li>
            <li>I get maybe 3 to 4 full</li>
            <li>helps me keep brushing a full two minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>However I&#x27;ve found that the addition of the spinning brush really puts the Oral-b over the top for me.  </li>
            <li>: it does feel like the brush really works on a more isolated area of the teeth thoroughly&lt;</li>
            <li>A two year warranty (good) and a 60 day money back guarantee are included.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you go the full two minutes, all four stars will darken (and the smiley face on the display smiles).  </li>
            <li>With two uses a day on a full charge, it can go about 4 days without being charged again.</li>
            <li>My teeth feels super clean and refreshed.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve ever used and superior to Sonicare) but having a charger that is only 110-130v and</li>
            <li>My dentist has had nothing but good things to say about my teeth and gums since I started using my Oral-B Triumph several years ago.  </li>
            <li>but the dental hygienist didn&#x27;t comment on how nice my teeth were until I came in after using the Oral-B Professional 5000 for six months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After losing the Phillips Sonicare Diamond</li>
            <li>Once you have set the clock up, bluetooth takes care of the rest, which is a cool feature.</li>
            <li>My mouth feels super clean.  </li>
            <li>- I wish there were more information on ordering and using more of the different heads available.</li>
            <li>Good product, my last one lasted 10 yrs.</li>
            <li>for a full charge.</li>
            <li>Uses the same heads, which is good because I had a supply of them.  </li>
            <li>It is really loud, and it kind of feels like you have a weed whacker in your mouth.</li>
            <li>There were no bad</li>
            <li>It took a full 24 hours to fully charge up initially, but the battery lasts for a good week of brushing on just one</li>
            <li>My new brush has great cleaning action.  </li>
            <li>I find that it takes around 24 hours for a full charge, and it discharges rather quickly.</li>
            <li>and my whole mouth really just feels better!  </li>
            <li>This is a pretty good electric toothbrush, bought it due to other reviews by I wasn&#x27;t that impressed.</li>
            <li>Other than that the product is great ..</li>
            <li>Happy with purchase and timer is extremely helpful, even has a pressure meter.</li>
            <li>I love this new brush!</li>
            <li>I was offered the ability to test and review this new Oral-B Healthy Clean + Floss Precision 5000 toothbrush, which I gratefully accepted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My teeth feel so fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>They make your&lt;br /&gt;mouth feel fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>The Oral-B feels more like a dentist cleaning and love the different settings incorporated into it.</li>
            <li>Adequate</li>
            <li>But then I started thinking about how often I paid twenty dollars or more for the cheaper versions at the drug stores and how they were mediocre at best.</li>
            <li>I personally find Oral B just cleans better, has more brush head options &amp; the rechargeable battery life seems longer.</li>
            <li>I had 4 cavities and mild gingivitis.</li>
            <li>big, wonderful design change is the holder for the individual brushes.</li>
            <li>My teeth are super smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is it, and I don&#x27;t have to put up with a quickly worn out brushhead.</li>
            <li>The timer is cute, not necessary, but cute.  </li>
            <li>I hadn&#x27;t purchased such a top of the line electric toothbrush before and didn&#x27;t realize how much better they are compared to the cheapie drugstore models.  </li>
            <li>The brush arrived to my apartment quickly and setup was super easy.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Lucky for him</li>
            <li>It does such an awesome job at the very next dental checkup after using this model for about 6 weeks, the hygeniest commented on what a difference she saw in my teeth.  </li>
            <li>Otherwise take a good look at the nearly identical Oral-b 4000 which, depending on the vagaries of Amazon pricing, can be much cheaper (when I bought mine</li>
            <li>I love the different settings I am able to choose from and the timer helps me with brushing to the max time.  </li>
            <li>Really quick review:&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li>This scrubbing action does a great job of removing plaque, preventing stains, and the Floss Action heads do well at getting between teeth and removing food particles.  </li>
            <li>Therefore, although the unit has different modes, you can&#x27;t use more than one unless you buy more than one brush head type.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Therefore, although the unit has different modes, you can&#x27;t use more than one unless you buy more than one brush head type.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>would recommend this toothbrush to anyone who cares about their teeth and gums and doesn&#x27;t mind the tingly vibrations (which I promise you get used to quickly).</li>
            <li>THANKFULLY AMAZON HAS SUPER customer service</li>
            <li>I live the timer that helps me be sure to brush for the right amount of time!</li>
            <li>Oral B toothbrushes are much more affordable than Sonicare high end toothbrushes.</li>
            <li>I just love it and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>P &amp; G was once one of the great iconic American brands and now this malfunctioning model has replaced older much better models.&lt;br /&gt;Buy a different brand.</li>
            <li>If you do it right your teeth feel amazingly clean.</li>
            <li>The bathroom is exactly where I need the clock to be accurate: the clock in the wireless display should be an atomic (automatic setting) variety.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I was hesitant to spend $110 on a toothbrush but the first time I used it I could tell a huge difference.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for several months already and I am very pleased.</li>
            <li>Teeth feel smooth as glass after the first use.</li>
            <li>The Oral B Professional solves this problem very well and in my opinion better than most of the Sonicare brushes.</li>
            <li>It is marginally useful at best and not necessary for properly using the brush.</li>
            <li>After the very first use, my Mom said &amp;</li>
            <li>This toothbrush is totally worth the price, compatible with the whole Oral B selection of brushes, and is overall a great product.</li>
            <li>My wife and myself use this daily and are very pleased with its performance.  </li>
            <li>Still adjusting to the intense cleaning action but overall very pleased with the function - I&#x27;ve owned several Oral-B toothbrushes but this is the best model I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>This is by far the most powerful and advanced wireless toothbrush I have owned.  </li>
            <li>Good as far as I can tell however will know more after next dental check.</li>
            <li>so I expect good quality and long life again.</li>
            <li>i think this will help keep my oral hygiene and health, good in the long term.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I rarely pay full price for anything they sell.</li>
            <li>the accesory is good to see how long are you using the toothbrush.</li>
            <li>The timer is a good way guide you on how long to brush.</li>
            <li>toothbrush and smart guide are easy to assemble.</li>
            <li>Bought this toothbrush to replace my previous Oral-B Professional one that the battery died on and find it to be even better at providing a great brushing experience and leaving my mouth feeling super clean.</li>
            <li>I would definately recommend this tothbrush to anyone who wants smooth feeling teeth and a clean mouth.</li>
            <li>My teeth and gums feel healthy clean as if I just came from my dentist&#x27;s office after a professional cleaning.  </li>
            <li>Oral-B Professional Healthy Clean +</li>
            <li>This Oral-B Professional Healthy Clean Precision 5000 Electric Toothbrush is an updated version of the Oral-B SmartSeries 5000 Toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>It not only does a great cleaning but the easy use of the other features of this unit make it an over all grand slam in my opinion.</li>
            <li>More importantly, these days we already have too many wireless devices that start interfering with each other.  </li>
            <li>All in all a good product I believe--as long as you use it!</li>
            <li>Love the new one!!!r</li>
            <li>My new Sonicare is compact with a well-balanced handle and a better frequency.</li>
            <li>&amp; I love the new toothbrush storage.  </li>
            <li>love my new brush</li>
            <li>I almost purchased the new top of the line Sonicare but after doing some comparison shopping I decided on the Oral B 5000.  </li>
            <li>new iteration of the Oral B/Braun toothbrush includes the Smart Guide, which is supposed to guide you in terms of the amount of time, kind of brushing, etc.</li>
            <li>Teeth feel great and it&#x27;s wayyyyy less effort.</li>
            <li>my teeth are cleaner , gums are much tighter and this unit is easy to use .</li>
            <li>By encouraging their 2 minute routine, the SmartGuide really helped turn things around very quickly.  </li>
            <li>Most importantly your teeth will fill extra clean.</li>
            <li>The case allows me to easily travel with it, which is often, and its very well protected.</li>
            <li>I really like how easy it is to get the brush heads on and off with the Oral B.</li>
            <li>I am really enjoying using the Oral-B Professional Healthy Clean + Floss action Precision 5000 electric toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>awsome brush with timer to keep me honest and maximize my smiles full potential cant wait to show off the smile</li>
            <li>It really makes your teeth feel cleaner!!  </li>
            <li>We would highly recommend this product!!!</li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m really glad I did!</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t explored the other settings than the original but, overall, I&#x27;m very impressed with it.</li>
            <li>It would be nice to be able to buy the device without the display for less.</li>
            <li>To me, the previous generation,  the Triumph model (Triumph Professional Care 9000) is the best of the lot</li>
            <li>The brush head also seems to be strong and sturdy that I think this will last me more than 3 months.</li>
            <li>This thing is hands down better than the old models, which I was happy with.</li>
            <li>In my last dentist visit, they say all looks really good, a positive sign.</li>
            <li>First off, my teeth feel soooo clean all the time now...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not quite dentist&#x27;s office clean but pretty close.  </li>
            <li>It works extremely well, looks great in my bathroom, and is pretty portable.  </li>
            <li>lol I can make a little stand for it out of Sugru or Polymer clay</li>
            <li>The little clock that comes with it is a great help to let you know when to move to another part of your mouth</li>
            <li>I am sure all these modes are fine, but 98 percent of the time I use \\&quot;Daily Clean.\\</li>
            <li>There is a rather large LED light on the back of the powered brush handle as well, which flashes brightly if you are applying too much pressure when brushing.  </li>
            <li>While brushing your teeth is by no means rocket science, this toothbrush has tons of fantastic features and it would be very helpful if someone told you how to do it.  </li>
            <li>While brushing your teeth is by no means rocket science, this toothbrush has tons of fantastic features and it would be very helpful if someone told you how to do it.  </li>
            <li>cause every time I travel, I have to bring the charger with (kinda defeats the purpose of a mobile toothbrush), and honestly, if it sits off the charger for more than an hour, then it&#x27;s just dead.</li>
            <li>I am sure if you are 10 years old you will be able to see it clearly, but your grandparents might not find it easy to read if you give it as a gift to older people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I thought my last Oral B electric toothbrush was amazing.</li>
            <li>The travel case is very convenient and holds the items securely.  </li>
            <li>Looking forward to a great check up in a few months.</li>
            <li>I really like the light on the handle,</li>
            <li>Have used oral&#x3D;B for a few years, get great check ups at the dentist since I started using oral-b.  </li>
            <li>Amazing German engineering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it is worth it</li>
            <li>I only bought this one for my husband because he loved my toothbrush so much.</li>
            <li>So back it goes to Amazon (no charge for return shipping, thank you, Amazon), to be replaced by what I hope will be a brush as effective as this one but without the frustration of D.O.A. electronics and the accompanying D.O.A. customer service.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s worth upgrading too.</li>
            <li>Worth the money.</li>
            <li>I wanted something with a timer for each section of my mouth but that was fun.</li>
            <li>It is actually fun to use.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>After about a weeks worth of using the whitening brush head paired with the whitening setting on the brush itself</li>
            <li>Worth the investment for dental health!&lt;br /&gt;KLB</li>
            <li>Kids always laugh at the smiley face.</li>
            <li>It was many many years ago, so i&#x27;m not really</li>
            <li>I used to be able to charge my old one overnight.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>Philips battery technology seems so far (2 months in) far superior: the unit lasts longer per charge and does not lose any battery life over time.</li>
            <li>the last 6 years I have used the very affordable Oral-B Vitality line with good success.  </li>
            <li>This toothbrush just feels better in your hand, and has better reach to remote areas of your mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s a clock when not in use, but I haven&#x27;t been able to set the clock so far (and I stopped trying).</li>
            <li>If you are short on counter space, as I am, this is a handy feature.</li>
            <li>The monitor may be useful if you have children</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ll worth the investment for your family.</li>
            <li>I feel this was worth the investment.</li>
            <li>/&gt;To sum up, most of the fancy features of this toothbrush weren&#x27;t as sophisticated as I&#x27;d expected</li>
            <li>The timer/clock is a nice feature because not only do appreciate the brushing timer</li>
            <li>Many brush choices available for what ever your personal want is.  </li>
            <li>I was golden.</li>
            <li>It cleans my teeth better than my old electric tooth brush.</li>
            <li>You definetly feel the difference with a fresh charge.</li>
            <li>worth every penny.</li>
            <li>The time is so much fun and helpful.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a much more complete and cost effectivesystem.    </li>
            <li>Totally worth the money.</li>
            <li>No doubt that your mouth is fresh.</li>
            <li>Top notch and professional.</li>
            <li>Worth the money.</li>
            <li>also found the Oral-B more tolerable for my sensitive teeth than the Sonicare.  </li>
            <li>Wifi, Dish Network remotes, Senn 180 wireless headphones and Logitech M510 mouse are all important to me, but adding anything more is a dubious proposition - especially if it is unnecessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If they love brushing their teeth, do it correctly and prevent cavities I am happy!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Oral B for making such a fabulous product.</li>
            <li>I have read some complaints about the floss action heads, but I personally love it.  </li>
            <li>well worth the money..  </li>
            <li>This model does a more thorough job of cleaning and is has some flexibility that my old unit does not.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Definitely worth the money.  </li>
            <li>To be honest, I only floss on rare occasions, but because of the use of this toothbrush I fooled my dentist.</li>
            <li>Works better than Phillips Sonicare by far.  </li>
            <li>Well worth buying it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is worth every penny.</li>
            <li>most professional.  </li>
            <li>It works better than my old Philips (over 100 bucks) one.  </li>
            <li>I can both feel the bristle action when brushing, and my periodic appointments with the hygienist have gone well (better than before the Oral-B).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two</li>
            <li>I sprung for this electric toothbrush and it is well worth the money.</li>
            <li>This unit is suprisingly powerful.  </li>
            <li>There are so many things that are better than my last one (of course that one was quite old)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t played with the settings much, I have been stuck on the floss setting.</li>
            <li>This device has the same circular motion that is on the equipment in the dentist&#x27;s office and does seem to do a better job of getting some food particles out from between teeth (not that good so flossing still necessary!).  </li>
            <li>Trips to the dentist seem to prove its worth, but I wish the battery was consumer replaceable.</li>
            <li>So far I am thoroughly satisfied with the performance of this product.  </li>
            <li>This brush is powerful and fun to brush with.&lt;br</li>
            <li>this product worth any penny  </li>
            <li>My 6-month cleanings and checkups are a complete joke now, I sit in the chair and ask him why I even bother to do these routine visits any more.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend this product to anyone, its totally worth the money.</li>
            <li>Dentist recommended this, if you can afford it way worth it.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li>to the more forceful action of the head, but</li>
            <li>I got to see a Triumph at my oral hygenist and realized that the newer ones were faster and with more capabilities than my old one</li>
            <li>I use the setting for sensitive teeth, and my gums are getting better.  </li>
            <li>It is a great tooht brush, a big change from my old oral-b tooht brush I had.</li>
            <li>I do not believe there is any reason to upgrade to the 5000 even though have a digital display is nice but not a must have.</li>
            <li>but it is well worth it.</li>
            <li>This has a lot more power and pulsations than the old one.  </li>
            <li>Do hesitate to purchase this brush because your teeth are worth every penny and you need your teeth for the rest of your life</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s got all the bells and whistles that make brushing your teeth fun.  </li>
            <li>This means you can have different types of brush heads for your own use OR one for each family member</li>
            <li>#34;my mouth feels so different -- very clean !&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>B003UKM9CO Oral-B Professional Healthy Clean Precision 1000]] toothbrushes, and this is a real improvement upon them.</li>
            <li>I have three of the several types of brush heads and am fully satisfied with their unique performance.</li>
            <li>After less than two weeks I already am amazed by the remarkable results:  not just in cleaning, but also, in comfort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Once Oral B started introducing more than two modes, it should have though about simplifying access to any particular mode, such as being able to change the default.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to set-up and use and I love the timer that tells you how long to brush in each area!</li>
            <li>Packaging was easy to open and everything was easy to assemble.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The new Smart Guide display is cute and informative, but I do not find it extremely useful.  </li>
            <li>the timer is great - it even does double duty as a nice small clock in the bathroom.</li>
            <li>This seems superior to other electric toothbrushes</li>
            <li>right when I need to plug it</li>
            <li>I have two problems with this purchase right off the bat:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Something, however, doesn&#x27;t set right with me about a toothbrush with a lithium battery that can&#x27;t be replaced.</li>
            <li>Yes, that&#x27;s right folks.</li>
            <li>I made the right choice.</li>
            <li>so you will brush your teeth for the right amount of time.</li>
            <li>It just doesn&#x27;t do it right.  </li>
            <li>The power is just right.  </li>
            <li>Stuck it right to my mirror and it helps me to keep moving along</li>
            <li>Right now this Braun is charging and is at 2/3 charged since 0700 hours til now 1840 hours.  </li>
            <li>as the right tool for the job.</li>
            <li>It took me quite awhile, trying to find the right one, and for me, this is it...</li>
            <li>I now know that I made the right choice buying it.</li>
            <li>It cleans much better than the usual Oral-B, and the timer is nice, serves as a clock, too.</li>
            <li>My mouth and teeth really feel clean when I finish brushing with this toothbrush</li>
            <li>It is also MUCH easier to clean.  </li>
            <li>I have been in love with the Braun Oral-B electric toothbrush since I bought my first in the early 1990s.</li>
            <li>It has really made a difference in how clean my mouth feels.  </li>
            <li>+ timer makes it very easy to regularly brush correctly.  </li>
            <li>While I&#x27;m enjoying the clean feeling from brushing as the 5000 does seem to give me better brushing results, I am not sure I would recommend the brush.  </li>
            <li>Very smart too with</li>
            <li>This brush feels great, less intense than a Sonicare, and the head moves as well as vibrates....</li>
            <li>Love that it does a thorough job, fairly quiet and recharges quickly.</li>
            <li>in all I would definitely recommend this for someone looking for a new toothbrush as I feel it does a great job and includes plenty of extras for a decent price.</li>
            <li>so you can move from one corner of your mouth to the next quadrant and complete the entire mouth in two minutes which should provide an excellent cleaning.&lt;br</li>
            <li>far this is the best I ever have, the most expensive those&lt;br /&gt;All</li>
            <li>/&gt;In general, the Sonicare is more like the cleaning tool used by the hygenist.  </li>
            <li>and he said that generally he likes his brushes to cover a bit more of the tooth area</li>
            <li>After about a month of use, I generally wold say I am satisfied with this purchase.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty fun to use</li>
            <li>She barely had to do anything for her cleaning, was mostly just polishing.  </li>
            <li>It almost ruins everything good about this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>the timer is nice, as it serves as a clock as well as the guide for how long you should be brushing..</li>
            <li>There is a case to cover the brushes, a timer that informs you how long to brush each quadrant and the cleaning experience is really nice.</li>
            <li>The floss action head contains 4 plastic prongs that are loosely attached so they have a great deal of movement when the head rotates.  </li>
            <li>so I keep good dental habits, but between dentist checkups I have a tendency to have really severe staining even though I&#x27;m not very much of a coffee, tea, or soda drinker.  </li>
            <li>Like any electric toothbrush, the heads do wear a little quickly, but Amazon has pretty good deals on replacements.</li>
            <li>This is a little skeevy for me, because I&#x27;d think there&#x27;s a bit of the other user&#x27;s toothpaste/saliva residue, but give it a good cleaning after each use, and you&#x27;re good.</li>
            <li>Awesome little toothbrush that has definitely improved my oral health.</li>
            <li>Excellent product that, at the very least, gives me the impression that my teeth are much cleaner.  </li>
            <li>I was ready to pay higher better quality, also the idea of having a screen to guide you brush sounded very developed to me.</li>
            <li>It does a great job cleaning my teeth, and I have very few complaints about its style, build quality, or feature set.  </li>
            <li>It does a great job cleaning my teeth, and I have very few complaints about its style, build quality, or feature set.  </li>
            <li>Also good for kids since it has the light up sensor if you push too hard.  </li>
            <li>Very fast, love the options, the add on tray is useful, allowing my husband and I to store our toothbrushes neatly right next to the toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>new model is fantastic.</li>
            <li>and I would certainly recommend to friends and family!</li>
            <li>My husband and I purchased two Oral-B Professional Healthy Clean + Floss Action Precision 5000 Rechargeable Electric Toothbrushes and couldn&#x27;t be happier.  </li>
            <li>: incredibly, in 2013, Oral B&#x27;s Customer Service Rep actually told me to send the unit to an authorized repair center at my expense.</li>
            <li>I would recommend the Sonicare over the Oral-B Professional Healthy Clean + Floss Action</li>
            <li>The remote display is fun, and kind of motivating.</li>
            <li>Come to think of it, the free cheap plastic toothbrush I just got from my dentist has a deep cleaning mode, too.</li>
            <li>Controlling gum infection with good home care and regular professional cleaning has been linked to a 50% reduction in strokes and heart attacks.  </li>
            <li>I love that this toothbrush comes with the independent clock, which is useful even when not using the toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Also shows the regular clock time in between brushing, which is nice to keep track of when you&#x27;re getting ready for work or whatever.&lt;br /&gt;-The</li>
            <li>Easy to use and not messy as some reviews have stated</li>
            <li>Love this tooth brush, the initial charging took over 24 hours to charge, but worth the wait.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The orthodontist wants my kids using an Oral B while in braces, as he says it cleans better with the floss action than a Sonicare around all that hardware.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed my teeth are far cleaner, and my whole mouth seems to be in better health.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good caliber toothbrush, but a cheaper build than the previous model.  </li>
            <li>Oral-B uses standard heads and chargers throughout their product line so this makes all my old accessories compatible -- a good thing.</li>
            <li>The features are great, it doesn&#x27;t require any effort to brush my teeth like a regular toothbrush, simply hold it on your teeth, and the brush does all the work!</li>
            <li>also love the 2 min setting in 30 sec intervals for precise cleaning.</li>
            <li>I before applied more pressure destroying my gums but now I am much pleased.</li>
            <li>so i bought the current model of my original and one of these new imiproved more powerful ones, the Precision 5000</li>
            <li>As with any toothbrush, manual or electric, it is still very important to floss daily.  </li>
            <li>I like this very much.  </li>
            <li>like this toothbrush very much</li>
            <li>I like it very much.</li>
            <li>(Ok for the US, not for Europe or South America)&amp;#62; Probably my fault, I am just hightlighting this in case this is important for other customer as well.</li>
            <li>Battery lasts a good 2 weeks; has same problem as previous version in that recharging takes more than 12 hours.</li>
            <li>It is also a little bulky, and has s fair amount of weight to it.  </li>
            <li>there where no instructions in the new packaging or helpful hints like the original box might of had.</li>
            <li>Leaves teeth feeling extra clean and smooth.  </li>
            <li>The main problem with the old one was the battery was junk, so I couldn&#x27;t use it more than a couple days without it running out.  </li>
            <li>The price seems a bit steep at first (compared to traditional brushes) but the clean you get is incomparable.  </li>
            <li>The price seems a bit steep at first (compared to traditional brushes) but the clean you get is incomparable.  </li>
            <li>toothbrushes with the little yellow rubber bristles are the best and get the teeth much cleaner than the brushes without them!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>;)  </li>
            <li>- I love that it holds multiple brush heads.  </li>
            <li>The first charge took about 24 hours, but after that it seems to charge fully in about 8 hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The first charge took about 24 hours, but after that it seems to charge fully in about 8 hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love the clock also and it lets me properly brush my teeth</li>
            <li>I read through many of the low reviews on this</li>
            <li>live.&lt;br /&gt;Two exact toothbrushes,...</li>
            <li>I am treating the 5000 exactly the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is my first electric brush.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve paid much more than the cost of this device for surgery on my gums and related dental visits.</li>
            <li>It splashes all over the place and when I put it in the dock to charge it drips so my mirror and my counter top constantly have toothpaste on it now.</li>
            <li>The first was the rubber feet at the bottom of the handle.</li>
            <li>I have been a user of Braun electric toothbrushes for 20 years, ever since the first generation.  </li>
            <li>Love that this has several speed/setting.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>It works much better than the under-$20 Oral-B vitality with a regular brush head.  </li>
            <li>and I am sure my next one will be oral B-5000 or newer version.</li>
            <li>I woke up the entire neighborhood!  :)</li>
            <li>I love having the digital clock on my bathroom mirror.  </li>
            <li>I like that the extra brush holder isn&#x27;t attached so that it saves room on the counter top.</li>
            <li>The separate viewing piece isn&#x27;t necessary if you&#x27;re going to pick a favorite speed and stick to it.</li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t drip inside and get filled with mildew like happened with my old Sonicare.</li>
            <li>That is saying people with uncontrolled periodontal disease have a 50% or higher risk of having a stroke or heart</li>
            <li>They may like the smiley face and the stars that light up as they complete each quadrant.</li>
            <li>This is the second Oral-B toothbrush we have bought and love them.</li>
            <li>First time that&#x27;s ever happened</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty dumb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>is fun to us to keep track on how much longer on this quadrant</li>
            <li>It has a timer to make sure that each quadrant of the mouth is given proper attention.</li>
            <li>First time electric toothbrush user.</li>
            <li>This model has more bells and whistles than I need, but it makes my mouth feel cleaner than brushing with a regular toothbrush.</li>
            <li>love the multiple settings.</li>
            <li>Wish it came with more toothbrushes as it only came with one flossing brush.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the Oral-B now for several weeks and glad I went with this.  </li>
            <li>&#x27;s talk about the head shape firstly.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t think I would ever wear out my first toothbrush</li>
            <li>Charging stand was cheapen somewhat since my first Oral-B</li>
            <li>The product was shipped fast!</li>
            <li>I love the timer that came with it and the multiple brush holder.</li>
            <li>Love the seperate display and different cleaning levels.</li>
            <li>This is my first electric toothbrush and it works well.</li>
            <li>Fast, as described, and well packed!</li>
            <li>First impressions:&lt;br /&gt;1</li>
            <li>Once you are able to contact a customer service rep, the process is pretty simple.</li>
            <li>Overall a 4 because I still feel like it could be faster motion or more of a sonic motion.</li>
            <li>The pulsations seem pretty well set.</li>
            <li>It has different speeds for great cleaning, whether you want deep cleaning to gentle cleaning for those with tender gums.  </li>
            <li>After first use saw a difference.</li>
            <li>I love the toothbrush, but was quite irritated to find that it came with only 1 brush head (when I bought its predecessor I got 4 brushes).  </li>
            <li>kinda placed me among the most hygienic they see...and the only thing I changed in my routine is the toothbrush.</li>
            <li>It came when it was scheduled or before and it does exactly what it advertises it will do.  </li>
            <li>This is my first experience with an electric toothbrush</li>
            <li>We are still using the first one</li>
            <li>Maybe it could be more heads in starting complect.</li>
            <li>My periodontist sold me the first one about 7 years ago and it has improved the state of my gums and teeth immeasurably.</li>
            <li>The toothbrush is exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>The only downside is the goofy display.</li>
            <li>/&gt;In contrast, the Oral-B seems to be more designed to actually gets its bristles into spaces, and to massage your gums.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;So, while I have not used the simpler models in the Oral-B \\&quot;Professional\\&quot; line, I would recommend that you consider those, especially since they look like a much better dollar value.</li>
            <li>but I wanted to try to see if this unit&#x27;s 5 different cleaning option would be better for me as I have a tendency to over brush and cause gum issues.  </li>
            <li>The 30 seconds and 2 minutes marks are now more definite, and there is an additional audio beep.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much Oral-B!</li>
            <li>Then wait for them to repair (or more likely replace)</li>
            <li>First one lasted 6 years until my youngest thought he should bang it on the sink</li>
            <li>The battery life is outstanding could let you brush ten days strait without charging.</li>
            <li>My second oral-b and we love it.  </li>
            <li>Of course you could have more kept in another place if your family was larger.</li>
            <li>First time I have uses a power tooth brush</li>
            <li>It has a timer indicator for two minutes of brushing, she amusingly stated she mentally gets alot of planning mapped out for the day.</li>
            <li>So after buying 2 more heads we ended up spending about the same.</li>
            <li>Used the prior version for many years until the battery went out.</li>
            <li>first I thought the timer/pressure sensor was hokey, but then I realized when using it that a)</li>
            <li>So far it is fantastic.</li>
            <li>This is my first electric toothbrush, recommended to me by my family dentist and oral hygienist.</li>
            <li>and I eat a LOT of sweets;)</li>
            <li>/&gt;This really is better for smaller mouths, my kids were only able to start using an Oral B when they got to be about</li>
            <li>And it does default to a clock when you are not using it, a feature I find myself using pretty often.  </li>
            <li>First power brush I have ever owned.</li>
            <li>Sense\\&quot; technology to make you aware of your brushing habits.</li>
            <li>and I find myself paying more attention to my gums, my mucosa, and tongue in my daily routine.</li>
            <li>first time I used it I couldn&#x27;t believe the difference it made</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t keep your lips tightly closed over the unit so you have to keep a Kleenex handy to catch the drips.</li>
            <li>The texture of the grip is different, and the body and buttons are more ergonomic to use.</li>
            <li>5/5 stars, still the same great Precision 5000 but with some minor tweaks.</li>
            <li>I thought I&#x27;d replace it with a higher end model.  </li>
            <li>I was pretty upset I did not make the move to electric toothbrushes</li>
            <li>With the 5000 I now have no problem brushing 2 minutes and most times I brush an extra minute.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the first electrci one for me</li>
            <li>I researched it first with my friend who is a dentist...guess what?</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The remote display is a nice touch</li>
            <li>We have an earlier version of this toothbrush and love the updates to the design.  </li>
            <li>However having used them both I do give the Oral-b the top marks for overall effectiveness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Other then that I love it!</li>
            <li>electric toothbrushes, this is exceptionally powerful with fast rotation.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, the toothbrush performance is still stellar.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, the toothbrush performance is still stellar.  </li>
            <li>I had used a Sonicare for ten plus years and didn&#x27;t think there was anything  better.  </li>
            <li>love it will not go back to manual brushing ,</li>
            <li>makes sure you cover every area in the 30 second time frames allowed.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I want in an electronic toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>I really enjoy this toothbrush over my old Sonicare.  </li>
            <li>First thing I checked if it had a dual volt charger.</li>
            <li>love all the different cleaning options that this toothbrush has to offer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It provides a comfortable and stimulating scrubbing action to your teeth and gum-line, but isn&#x27;t overly aggressive to cause discomfort.  </li>
            <li>Long lasting on battery charge &amp; does a great job on my teeth.</li>
            <li>This is a technical machine that will take more reading of the manual and training on my part.</li>
            <li>I tried to charge it for the first time overseas where it is 220.</li>
            <li>but I have the same toothbrush and love it.  </li>
            <li>We  have owned different Oral B power toothbrushes over the years with the latest being the 1000 and the 4000.  </li>
            <li>Love the features, such as timer and pressure sensitivity alarm.</li>
            <li>;-)</li>
            <li>this is the first electric toothbrush for me</li>
            <li>I love the timer that beeps every 30 seconds so you can give equal time to all areas of your mouth</li>
            <li>but I had better experience with prior Oral-B products</li>
            <li>First of all me and my wife are orthodontists, so I know what I am talking about.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t my first Oral-B toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not quite sure why the brush head that was included in the package was the Floss-Action head, rather than the standard ProWhite head..</li>
            <li>Well maybe not, but regular brushing with it reduces the plaque mining at the dentists office, which makes that experience a lot better.</li>
            <li>Good toothbrush, round head reaches space along gums, and between teeth.</li>
            <li>I laughed when I saw the device and thought it was gimmicky, but now I am hooked and watch the screen.</li>
            <li>If you are new to them, it may provide a bit too much buzz for you to immediately become comfortable</li>
            <li>It has been awhile since I purchased an electric tooth brush, and so far, we pleased with our new addition to our bathroom shelf.  </li>
            <li>Teeth feel clean and my dental hygienist even commented on how clean my teeth were on the last visit.</li>
            <li>In time, I learned the right amount of pressure to apply, thanks to this sensor, and the sensor no longer interrupts my brushing.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Considering the technology of today it could have been much more sophisticated and helpful without being more expensive - its a real shame.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not necessarily bad, just different (and my teeth feel as clean as ever).    </li>
            <li>I use the deep cleaning mode and my teeth are very clean.</li>
            <li>In theory, it sounds great, but the little display unit seems like overkill for adult brushes.  </li>
            <li>I do feel my gums are a bit cleaner, though I did a pretty good job brushing prior with my regular toothbrush.</li>
            <li>The toothbrush required more time to charge (the first time) than I expected, but was worth the wait.  </li>
            <li>The best part is, if you brush long enough to get that extra bonus star, you will sometimes (not every time) be greeted with a winking smiley face.  </li>
            <li>and so far feel that it is definitely worth the price!</li>
            <li>It arrived quickly and was new in the package</li>
            <li>This is a nice replacement, but the Triumph was a much better product, used the same brush heads, and only cost a few dollars more.</li>
            <li>This is a nice replacement, but the Triumph was a much better product, used the same brush heads, and only cost a few dollars more.</li>
            <li>The Oral-B Professional makes my teeth feel just from the dentist clean.  </li>
            <li>I bought the Oral_B Professional Health Clean at the recommendation of my dentist.</li>
            <li>B0002KHU3I Oral-B Professional Dual Clean Replacement Brush Head 3 Count]]</li>
            <li>The brush heads are easy to replace, and there are many different types of heads to suit different oral care needs.</li>
            <li>This is a phenomenal toothbrush -- a real keeper -- but had to return mine because the accompanying digital display was D.O.A. ...</li>
            <li>I bought it mostly because it lights up in red if you apply to much pressure.</li>
            <li>I have gum disease, and can&#x27;t seem to floss enough, or good enough.</li>
            <li>I initially bought this for myself and love it so much that I bought one for all of  my children.  </li>
            <li>The toothbrush definitely does a good job in getting between the teeth and under the gums but something with a slightly bigger head might&#x27;ve made this product</li>
            <li>The nice thing about the 3000 (I&#x27;ve now discovered) is that, even though it has 3 modes, you get to sensitive mode second.</li>
            <li>I had more satisfactory results by ordering the \\&quot;Oral-B Professional Sensitive Gum Care Replacement Brush Head\\&quot; (also on Amazon).  </li>
            <li>The Floss Action brush heads do such an effective job that my dentist always compliments me on how well I floss.  </li>
            <li>The charge really does last 5 days, and the travel case is much more functional than the ziplock bag I used to use.  </li>
            <li>Well worth the savings I get from not having to pay high dental bills.</li>
            <li>The only thing it doesn&#x27;t clean is between teeth, so don&#x27;t forget to floss!</li>
            <li>I am now a loyal fan of the Oral B Floss Action toothbrush!</li>
            <li>design is exceedingly clever, helping you avoid excess force, actively warning you with lights and alerts to not apply excess pressure - very effective protection for sensitive tissues.  </li>
            <li>a positive note though</li>
            <li>The handle is pretty large, but not too large.</li>
            <li>The stand gets pretty grimy fast, and has to be cleaned weekly.  </li>
            <li>nitpick is that you pretty much have to keep the brush charging or it will be sluggish after two or three brushings.  </li>
            <li>I did not see the point in dropping so much money for a higher end model.</li>
            <li>short, I love and prefer this newer model which is roughly 50-100% more oscillations.</li>
            <li>It takes the toothbrush a long time to charge, and it does not stay charged many days.</li>
            <li>As a long time Sonicare user I was reluctant to believe that anything was better than the Sonicare.</li>
            <li>I love the timer that shows me how long I need to brush my teeth for.</li>
            <li>They are pretty much identical.  </li>
            <li>as more time went on, the red light went up constantly, and now it can no longer hold a charge</li>
            <li>The floss action brushes are kinda cool.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very happy with this product as long as it lasts long enough to justify the price.</li>
            <li>Unbelievably this good toothbrush comes with a 110-130 power supply.  </li>
            <li>The deep clean and massage modes were well worth it.</li>
            <li>I like the head on this brush better than the the new OralB sonic because I have a small mouth and this head just fits better.  </li>
            <li>I used the Sonicare right after a cleaning, so it was too soon to say if it was equally effective (and I am now going to shift back to it, and will update my review later with those impressions).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>In all the years that I&#x27;ve had my Oral B brushes, my dentists have always said that my teeth look good, and I&#x27;ve had very few cavities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>: (  I liked it very much - very nice sleek design and charging options, not too loud, teeth felt really clean . . .</li>
            <li>First one was amazing, I&#x27;ve traveled with it a lot and just after 3 years of everyday usage</li>
            <li>The travel carrier is nice but could be a bit less bulky and sturdier.  </li>
            <li>brush is easy to use for several reasons.  </li>
            <li>The set I got came with two \\&quot;normal\\&quot; heads, a super soft one, and one meant to reach hard-to-get crevices.</li>
            <li>I first tried a cheap, generic brand one</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s too easy to accidentally erode the gum line through regular use.  </li>
            <li>This revised Precision 5000 is a really solid toothbrush, easy to set up, and works just fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is easy to use and works well in all areas of the mouth, including the hard-to-get back areas of the mouth.</li>
            <li>The only think that it seems a bit strong for my gums.</li>
            <li>This is my first experience with an electric toothbrush with this kind of power and feature set, and it makes manual brushing seem like a waste of time.</li>
            <li>So much better than the single option I had for the Sonicare Essence.    </li>
            <li>But unless mine is faulty it doesn&#x27;t seem that smart.</li>
            <li>The display that comes with it is unnecessarily large though in my opinion.</li>
            <li>9900 Power Toothbrush with Smart Guide]]</li>
            <li>I went to Oral-B&#x27;s website for service (certainly at 6 months it still should be under warranty).  </li>
            <li>The smart guide tells you where to brush. . .</li>
            <li>\\&quot;Smart</li>
            <li>/&gt;i don&#x27;t understand how the monitor (smart guide) work .</li>
            <li>and I also like smart guide to that</li>
            <li>The smart guide is a battery operated clock that has a smiley face on it with a circle around it and stars on the bottom of the screen.  </li>
            <li>you turn on the toothbrush the clock on the smart guide disappears and a timer starts listing the time you use the toothbrush.</li>
            <li>The smart guide helps me  brush for the recommended amount of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;This model comes with a charger, one head, a traveling case and a separate wireless smart guide unit.</li>
            <li>The traveling case is large and bulky.</li>
            <li>The smart guide helps you stay on track and brush each quadrant and brush for 2 minutes</li>
            <li>upper left top of mouth / upper right top of</li>
            <li>I contacted Oral B again and they sent another Smart Guide it too does not sync with the toothbrush</li>
            <li>It seems to me that there are a lot of electric toothbrushes out there and while the Oral-B Professional Healthy Clean + Floss Action Precision 5000 does the job, if I could go back in time, I&#x27;d probably try another brand.  </li>
            <li>Fortunately, the instructions are not long and they seemed readable to me.  </li>
            <li>It helps me get the back of my bottom front teeth much more effectively (because of the small head and the movement).  </li>
            <li>Unless you own a soldering kit, a T6 screwdriver and possess the savvy to do basic electronics, you will eventually be tossing this thing into the garbage can or sending it off for \\&quot;repair\\&quot; (not sure what this costs or how many weeks</li>
            <li>This new one needs to be recharged for the better part of a day if it has been used for several brushings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>or better, finally had to get a new one</li>
            <li>This model, the Smart Series 5000 HEALTH CLEAN + FLOSS ACTION model has some improvements over the older models which some of us were still using, so I could compare them side by side.</li>
            <li>They last for years, do a great job, and can be had for less than $20.  </li>
            <li>each brush can be programmed easily for two different brushes, which is really convenient.  </li>
            <li>each brush can be programmed easily for two different brushes, which is really convenient.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s is easy to get distracted and not spend enough time or get start thinking and spend way too much in one area.&lt;br /&gt;Let</li>
            <li>The external guide isn&#x27;t super useful, but does keep you on track to ensure you&#x27;re brushing for two minutes.</li>
            <li>This electric brush will clean your teeth in a manner far superior to any manual brush, and for that matter, much better than certain inexpensive electrics such as the [[ASIN:B0014AI4VM Spinbrush Pro]], which I had been using for a few years prior.  </li>
            <li>They really aren&#x27;t useful at all unless you have very sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li>Only (1) is included, and it seems fine for my purposes.</li>
            <li>the communication between the brush and accessory uses a certain amount of battery life on both devices, but I never took the time to determine how much.</li>
            <li>With the smart guild clock-timer it&#x27;ll even warns you if you are applying to much pressure.</li>
            <li>The smiley face on the read out is a nice coaching tool that gives you a  little bit of immediate gratification.</li>
            <li>The only downside to it is it tends to make more of a mess (more splatter).</li>
            <li>Seems to clean better, I&#x27;m anxious to to see how we&#x27;ll</li>
            <li>The 5000 feels a little bit more powerful, and it has a longer battery life as well.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>The charge lasts quite a long time, and my teeth are CLEAN!</li>
            <li>Was told my gums very healthy and no cavities with very little work needed from the hygienist.</li>
            <li>This new shape to the stand is stable and won&#x27;t tip over, it is more stable than older model&#x27;s recharging stands which were smaller and just wider than the toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Use too much pressure, and the handle and monitor light up red.</li>
            <li>Overall a gentle cleaning that provides fantastic results.</li>
            <li>For example, the pressure warning (when you press the brush too much upon your teeth), now has a red light element as well.</li>
            <li>toothbrush comes with five cleaning modes which are daily clean, deep clean, sensitive clean, whitening and massage.</li>
            <li>I really feel like my mouth is cleaner after using my $20 Oral B.</li>
            <li>My teeth are so much whiter</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think I would use this feature as much as I do.  </li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>My teeth feel so much cleaner after using this.</li>
            <li>, I really do feel like my teeth get cleaner than they ever have before.</li>
            <li>The brush works very well.</li>
            <li>We are much happier with the Oral B company.</li>
            <li>Thanks for offering it for sale</li>
            <li>The travel case is actually very convenient.</li>
            <li>and I know I don&#x27;t have the money to replace the whole thing each year.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>Who wants this?    </li>
            <li>How am I suppose to be responsible when I cannot remove the battery?  </li>
            <li>and yet does it gently.</li>
            <li>and I really like it.</li>
            <li>I had the triumph design for 10 years before it quit on me (it was still trying, just not holding charge and not working w as much umph).</li>
            <li>As for settings, who knows if they really do anything, but I&#x27;ll continue to tell myself they do.</li>
            <li>I find it very helpful</li>
            <li>It is much cheaper.</li>
            <li>I use the toothbrush on the highest setting and I really feel my teeth are much cleaner than before.  </li>
            <li>but it doesn&#x27;t seem to work very well.</li>
            <li>in hand and red light pressure alert.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unobtrusive beeps.</li>
            <li>, I really like the timer it comes with</li>
            <li>only 1 light was blinking and still blinking after 12 hours.  </li>
            <li>but I think my check up will go very well.</li>
            <li>If you have a family that uses this, the costs can add up very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>still really like this toothbrush, but...</li>
            <li>Everybody should have confidence on the product of Germany, it make my teeth healthier and it acts like a babysitter caring my teeth gently and warm-hearted.</li>
            <li>After using the toothbrush I can defiantly feel a difference on how much cleaner my teeth feel.</li>
            <li>And the charging stand is very convenient for storage and charging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this toothbrush!</li>
            <li>I really like that</li>
            <li>The receive of the gift really likes it.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t a toothbrush shutting itself off if I apply too much pressure.</li>
            <li>The toothbrush works really well. .</li>
            <li>I really like the timer.  </li>
            <li>It really does keep me in track.</li>
            <li>.. cleans well fast shipping</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product!  </li>
            <li>His teeth are looking much whiter.</li>
            <li>It cleans my teeth and gums very well.  </li>
            <li>I really recommend it.  </li>
            <li>That gives me so much peace of mind.</li>
            <li>Really eliminates plaque.  </li>
            <li>The time is very clearliy heard from the &amp;#34;beep&amp;#34; of the brush.</li>
            <li>I really like the timer that beeps every 30 seconds signaling it&#x27;s time to move to another quadrant of your mouth.  </li>
            <li>It is a very well thought product.</li>
            <li>really solid.&lt;br /&gt;-Great</li>
            <li>I changed from Sonicare to try this brush, but it has a much lower frequency than Sonicare; this causes me to have dizziness and nausea when brushing my teeth.</li>
            <li>I always feel like it cleans my teeth really well.</li>
            <li>until I realized I didn&#x27;t really need it for anything</li>
            <li>The brush has a red flashing light to warn you about the pressure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s a lot louder than my prior toothbrush and not all that smooth.  </li>
            <li>For my needs and wants.</li>
            <li>This quality alone is what really sold me on the brush.    </li>
            <li>Timer very helpful...</li>
            <li>Feels like my whole skull is vibrating!&lt;br /&gt;At</li>
            <li>Coupled with an Waterpik water flosser that I bought from Amazon as well, my teeth feel and look much healthier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Really like the clock.</li>
            <li>and my hygienist is seeing much improvements.</li>
            <li>Works very well.  </li>
            <li>It really cleaned my teeth</li>
            <li>The Triumph series only blinked a recessed light on the LCD.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
            <li>This holder is a much simpler design that prevents accumulation, and that&#x27;s way easier to clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So I really don&#x27;t like brushing my teeth.</li>
            <li>I really like this toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really use them.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>I really like how it beeps to tell you to go on.  </li>
            <li>Highly reccommended!</li>
            <li>Very please with this upgrade.</li>
            <li>Very usable.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this!</li>
            <li>My teeth feel much cleaner after using the Oral-B tooth brush than it does after using the manual tooth brush.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m quite happy with the different settings and also the different settings from time to time for deep cleaning and massaging my gums.</li>
            <li>and I really like the way</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this!</li>
            <li>If too much pressure is applied, a sensor will stop the motor for about two seconds and the toothbrush will beep.</li>
            <li>The charger itself is very convenient, lightweight, and subtle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I would absolutely recommend this product.</li>
            <li>this toothbrush works really well.  </li>
            <li>So if you really want to go all out and get a toothbrush that does everything for you, this is it.  </li>
            <li>This is the third version, purchased it primarily for travel</li>
            <li>do enjoy the deep cleaning mode that this model has as well..</li>
            <li>Very self explanatory.  </li>
            <li>Compared to the one I just replaced this one feels way more rough on my teeth and gums.  </li>
            <li>It even lets you know if you&#x27;re applying too much pressure.</li>
            <li>I absolutely adore it.  </li>
            <li>Much like your cell phone.</li>
            <li>Highly Recommended!</li>
            <li>I wish my weedwhacker had that much power.  </li>
            <li>digit timer is also a very convenient bathroom clock as well.</li>
            <li>But this Oral-B PC 5000 is a real bummer.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>My husband used to use too much pressure while brushing; this toothbrush alerts him as well as adjusts when he&#x27;s overdoing it.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery.</li>
            <li>This takes getting used to if you have used a toothbrush your whole life.  </li>
            <li>i was looking so much time for guide for this.&lt;br</li>
            <li>do not use the smartguide that came with the toothbrush because I really don&#x27;t need it</li>
            <li>He found the remote indicator helpful and entertaining.  </li>
            <li>The motor has a whole lot of kick so, if you&#x27;ve been neglecting your teeth and gums (tsk, tsk), then I recommend putting it on a gentler setting than its defaults.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My wife however hates how much it rattles her head when she uses it.  </li>
            <li>Clean\\&quot; mode which really means \\&quot;Longer Brush Time\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>The Sonicare has a much slimmer design.  </li>
            <li>Really, just buy another oral B</li>
            <li>It is more than I expected.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>got this for my wife , she loves them , they really look real</li>
            <li>, it works really well and doesn&#x27;t need a charge for quite awhile.</li>
            <li>THAT APPEARS IF YOU APPLY TOO MUCH PRESSURE.  </li>
            <li>whole kit includes everything you need.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li>My wife, who goes through brush heads way too fast has had to adjust as well.  </li>
            <li>My dental hygienist recommended this model as it is the one that she uses and she is very fussy about teeth cleaning.</li>
            <li>I really, really dislike it, and I tend to watch the timer so that I know when to pause brushing.</li>
            <li>It lights up one star for every 30 seconds you brush, and the goal is to light up 4-stars to indicate you have brushed for the recommended 2 minutes.  </li>
            <li>Really cleans my teeth</li>
            <li>Notwithstanding the vigorous brushing comment, it tells you (via a red light on the brush) if you are overdoing it;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Thanks oral-B.</li>
            <li>My teeth and mouth feel much cleaner.</li>
            <li>The timer is very helpful, and I really do find myself with a cleaner mouth (or so I feel it).  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>If you like really sleek design and neat gadgets, the Philips travel case and charging options are much nicer.  </li>
            <li>This toothbrush really makes a difference.  </li>
            <li>It cleans really really well.</li>
            <li>My daughter-in-law loves it so much that she&#x27;s now buying one for her mother.</li>
            <li>I really like this</li>
            <li>The whole family(3 of us) is using it.</li>
            <li>My teeth feel so much cleaner over a manual toothbrush.</li>
            <li>One of the things I really like is the the way the two minute timer works.</li>
            <li>There are several brush head options available for this toothbrush&lt;br</li>
            <li>My last dentist appt was 4 months ago and my teeth are still build up free...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m amazed by how much cleaner my teeth feel - it sounds corny</li>
            <li>I know how to brush and how much force to apply, and as a result of that, I have never have calculus.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>/&gt;First, the sensor tells if you are exerting too much pressure on the teeth - this is to help prevent enamel abrasion.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>It is very efficient.</li>
            <li>I LOVE the smiley remote timer too.</li>
            <li>Was unsure about the newer version since it had a different charging block and a different battery display, but it&#x27;s just as nice</li>
            <li>&#x27;s be honest, everyone at one time or another has eaten something and then immediately brushed their teeth only to feel that there are some residual food particles in and between their teeth.  </li>
            <li>In this incarnation Oral-B have decided that users need a more clear &amp;#34;signal&amp;#34; when to change which teeth are getting brushed.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an impovement over my last one which was many years old.  </li>
            <li>Nice product the only problem is a short battery charge , I Almost have to chargre this every day .</li>
            <li>It is thick, the sides are smooth, and it tapers toward the top.  </li>
            <li>The real value of this remote device is if you have children, or  just like some thing cute in the bathroom.  </li>
            <li>My son had a battery toothbrush prior to this one and he says this is by far the better of the two.  </li>
            <li>And silly as it may sound, it feels good to always get a \\&quot;five star\\&quot; brushing</li>
            <li>It does a good job to get my children to brush their teeth for at least 2 minutes.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always been the kind of person that only brushed his teeth to escape the incriminating stares of his dentist.</li>
            <li>Been in use for a few months, and so far so good.</li>
            <li>A good manual (written in clear English) is included along with the brush and accessories (with the former... gasp...</li>
            <li>clock is nice, but not necessary, but does double as a bathroom clock.  </li>
            <li>The only downside is that the brush on its stand plus the timer take up more space on the sink than my old brush.</li>
            <li>so I am sure I will get used to this, but right now it seems a little cumbersome.    </li>
            <li>The toothbrush system has settings for sensitive gums, deep clean, normal clean, whitening and massage mode.  </li>
            <li>The look is new and there&#x27;s more minor improvements that were made that you can read about.</li>
            <li>To me the wireless guide is a very useful visual cue.</li>
            <li>It was a very worthwhile purchase that I hope will last for a very long time.</li>
            <li>I have gotten pretty good at counting the 30 second intervals and if you over-pressure the brush a red light pops on on the brush (as well as the little monitor).  </li>
            <li>the first one stopped working after 2 years, and never got the rebate on this new one we bought.</li>
            <li>If your teeth build up plaque faster than you can remove it with a manual tooth brush this oral B professional tooth brush may be right for you.&lt;br /&gt;Modern</li>
            <li>With this new model, even this odd area is getting gentle, effective cleaning - and it no longer feels sensitive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>one minor flaw is that mildew builds up inside of the brush heads quite easily..</li>
            <li>I love this features since it saves both money and headaches (having a replacement head for 1 toothbrush when you really need a replacement head for the other toothbrush).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>All other much cheaper models will  have 3 and much more convenient cases.</li>
            <li>We have had an oral b electric tooth brush for years but felt it was slowing down so we purchased this new Oral B Professional &amp; Healthy clean + unit.  </li>
            <li>Gives an absolute deep clean without being too aggressive.</li>
            <li>If your own main use is for whitening, you might want to skip to someone else&#x27;s review, because that is not particularly relevant to me.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The Oral B Professional Health Clean &amp; Brush Action Precision 500 defefinately exceeded every one of my expectations.  </li>
            <li>really like the floss head on the deep clean mode.</li>
            <li>Not only are my teeth very visibly whiter, they are extremely clean.  </li>
            <li>Does it work better than any other brush on the market?</li>
            <li>I have used other electric tooth brushes before but this one is so much better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always owned Sonic Care toothbrushes in the past, but decided to buy Oral B this time - like it MUCH better!</li>
            <li>Oh, OK, I&#x27;ll just pull out that instruction manual I have in my wallet or the other one I have mounted to the bathroom wall.  </li>
            <li>First, the packaging has been improved - it is now similar to Amazon&#x27;s Frustration-Free packaging and most likely better for the environment due to</li>
            <li>but it is better than the Other brand.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It does a great job cleaning, and I even found on the day of transitioning from the old to the new model that my teeth felt instantly cleaner with a bit fewer rough spots.</li>
            <li>This battery toothbrush is powerful enough to drive the Floss Action brush head adequately.  </li>
            <li>Even though there are five \\&quot;modes of operation\\&quot; and one of them is 45 seconds per section (deep clean), you cannot set that mode as the default.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure that I&#x27;ll use this feature, but it&#x27;s great to have instead of requiring people to buy multiple toothbrushes (which can get pricey</li>
            <li>My teeth feel really clean and my teeth are staying white.</li>
            <li>so i had finally ordered one and it leaves your teeth feeling so clean.</li>
            <li>Teeth actually stay, that clean feel, longer than hand brushing.</li>
            <li>Brushing has never left my teeth feeling so clean.</li>
            <li>This gets my teeth so clean I only have to brush every three or four days now!</li>
            <li>It is great for children as well as lazy adults such as myself.  </li>
            <li>this is the first tool that we&#x27;ve found useful to get our son to properly brush his teeth.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The brush automatically beeps (in the daily clean cycle)</li>
            <li>clean for 6 months until the next check up.  </li>
            <li>No complaints and my teeth always feel clean, would definitely recommend this brush.</li>
            <li>(30 seconds for each quadrant in daily clean mode).  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m still using this toothbrush, except that the battery BARELY lasts a full 2-minute brush (on normal mode).</li>
            <li>Also, the battery does not last as long as I would have liked.</li>
            <li>I was very sad as I know the normal cost of a new one, but thanks to Amazon I could afford a replacement brush immediately, and best of all it was delivered in 2 days thanks to amazon prime!</li>
            <li>I really like the little clock with the smiley face who frowns at me when i brush too hard and winks when I do a great job!</li>
            <li>Most of my life I&#x27;ve used a manual toothbrush but about 2 years ago I switched to one of those inexpensive electric toothbrushes that are sold right alongside the manual ones in the store (they usually cost around $10).  </li>
            <li>There is even a pressure senor to tell when you are applying to much pressure while you are brushing(also little bright red flash around the where the brush head connects with the power handle.  </li>
            <li>The five different settings, and even the little &amp;#34;smiley&amp;#34; monitor make it a complete system for great oral hygiene.  </li>
            <li>Dry it off after each use, discharge the battery once every few months, and it&#x27;s perfectly happy.</li>
            <li>My dentist told me my plack build up was less than the month before that was good enough for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Cleaning our teeth should be treated as a vital element of one&#x27;s daily personal hygiene regimen, and I highly recommend the [[ASIN:B008PEMOV6 Oral-B Professional Healthy Clean +</li>
            <li>Cleaning our teeth should be treated as a vital element of one&#x27;s daily personal hygiene regimen, and I highly recommend the [[ASIN:B008PEMOV6 Oral-B Professional Healthy Clean +</li>
            <li>The long interruption disrupts smooth brushing of the teeth.    </li>
            <li>In less than two minutes I&#x27;m able to clean my entire mouth.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the first professional toothbrush that I have owned.  </li>
            <li>Nice just to have a small clock in the bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The kit came with extras like four different brush heads, full tube Crest Pro-Health toothpaste/mouthwash and Oral-B flossing tape.  </li>
            <li>I find I need to charge it just short of a week after a full charge (that is with my husband and me both using it twice a day).  </li>
            <li>The whole clock with the smiley face is a bit unnecessary but more importantly the tooth brush works perfectly.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t feel there is sufficient added value to justify the higher price this model commands over the Professional 3000.</li>
            <li>It is simple to use, and the smiley face on the viewing panel provides ample motivation for me to brush my teeth for a full 2 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My own past experiences with both brands.</li>
            <li>It will also tell you if you have not brushed your full two minutes.</li>
            <li>Even after the first use, it felt as though I had been to the dentist for a professional dental cleaning.</li>
            <li>The first time I used this toothbrush, my teeth felt they had been given a complete overhauling by a dentist.</li>
            <li>is a nice feature, and the docking/charging station also takes up a small footprint, which is nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>caddy holds 4 separate brush heads for 4 different users, and that may be useful for families with kids who share a bathroom and can, thus, share a power toothbrush body, keeping their brush heads separate (different colored rings are available for each brush</li>

            <li>I know I NEVER brushed for a full two minutes before, and I never focused on a quarter at a time.  </li>
            <li>The different settings are helpful for different tyeps of brushing, my favorite being the deep clean setting.</li>
            <li>It leaves my teeth smooth and clean, not like ordinary toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Horribly disappointed as a I previously had great experiences with Braun products and considered Braun to have a great reputation for quality products and design.  </li>
            <li>Well, our worries are over with the new 5,000!</li>
            <li>It is very nice to have such a wide variety of heads to meet specific needs.</li>
            <li>I really like being able to track how long my son brushes and like the multiple ways the toothbrush detects too much brushing pressure.  </li>
            <li>The charger that comes with the new version is 110v which is ironic</li>
            <li>This new model is very efficient.</li>
            <li>We haven&#x27;t used the polishing cycle yet but can tell you that this is a whole new experience in cleaning your teeth and one you can tell is making a difference.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the investment and there is no way you will ever get your teeth as clean with a manual brush or with the half as..</li>
            <li>I also had some previous experience with the cheaper versions of the Oral B electric toothbrushes that are designed more for travel which I didn&#x27;t care for at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>OK, a slight exaggeration...</li>
            <li>MUCH better than previous styles.</li>
            <li>More motion, but less intense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This works soooo much better than your typical manual toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I had the previous version for many years and the battery gave out.</li>
            <li>I was able to buy it for 40.00 less</li>
            <li>The cleaning modes for the brush are Daily Clean, Deep Clean, Sensitive, Whitening, and Massage.</li>
            <li>It provides 5 cleaning modes- daily clean, deep clean, sensitive, whitening, and massage.  </li>
            <li>It provides 5 cleaning modes- daily clean, deep clean, sensitive, whitening, and massage.  </li>
            <li>It cleans so much better than the Sonicare I owned previously.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s easy to use, holds a charge for quite awhile, everything I wanted and expected in an electric toothbrush...</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is easy to use and has a wireless remote that counts the time when you start brushing so that you brush your teeth for a minimum of 2 minutes twice a day as recommended by dentists.</li>
            <li>As I am getting older, iI am quite concerned with preserving my teeth.  </li>
            <li>I upgraded from a much older model and after a week my teeth feel like I just visited the dentist.</li>
            <li>I had a older model that died and needed to replace, it was not in stock</li>
            <li>This toothbrush has much more power than the basic models, and five different settings on how that power is applied to your teeth.  </li>
            <li>Decent toothbrush.</li>
            <li>When I saw this product reviewed on Dr. Oz&#x27;s show and found it for a decent price on Amazon (and I had a $15 rebate), I decided to go for it.</li>
            <li>you get use to the larger brush head, it does a noticeable better job deep cleaning your gums and all.  </li>
            <li>The quadrant notification is definitely helpful in making sure you are hitting each part of the mouth equally.  </li>
            <li>I upgraded from an older oral-b model.</li>
            <li>This one is more sophisticated than my last one and the brush actually stops and beeps briefly after the 30 second brushing interval for each quadrant.</li>
            <li>The toothbrush also has several settings for personal care and more.</li>
            <li>My main area of need is avoiding gingivitis.  </li>
            <li>Definitely a must buy, I can never go back to those cheap drug store brushes ever again!</li>
            <li>I have the older version of this</li>
            <li>Replaced an older model that I had for years!&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m hoping that&#x27;s just because of the larger brush head that causes me to open my mouth farther and that it will pass as I become more accustomed to it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>- It&#x27;s become the main unit</li>
            <li>and I travel with the older one.</li>
            <li>I bought the product mainly for the pressure sensor</li>
            <li>Needed to place me older model do to the fact it</li>
            <li>It replaced a much older Oral B cordless tooth brush.  </li>
            <li>main concern it seems is to get my birthdate before I can proceed with my question...  </li>
            <li>This toothbrush replaced an older model that was dropped and stopped working.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty easily motivated by getting &#x27;gold stars&#x27; and seeing the little face get &#x27;happier&#x27; when I brush longer.  </li>
            <li>available modes include settings for sensitive teeth, deep cleaning, whitening and just a normal mode for schlubs like me.</li>
            <li>This is a user friendly electric toothbrush that is helpful to people, like myself, who don&#x27;t brush their teeth as long as they should.</li>
            <li>Gives you all of the good and no wasted expense on stuff of no value to your tooth health (again, in my humble opinion).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would say the Oral-B brand of brushes are far superior to any other regardless of the hype (I&#x27;ve used the other brands on &#x27;test&#x27; drives and just really prefer the cleaning action of these babies, but again, I&#x27;m a 20 yr plus oral-B</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend.</li>

            <li>Always used oral b products, and, highly recommend this newest electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>So, If you want to stay out of the dentists chair My wife and I Highly recommend an Oral-B</li>
            <li>It feels substantial and of high quality.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this Oral-B.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended,</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>it were my own money, would I buy the Oral B Professional 5000, or consider the [[ASIN:B003UKKHB4 Oral-B Professional 3000]] which has the same basic features but with fewer bells and whistles?</li>
            <li>I like the smart guide timers with this brand which my old Oral-B had too.</li>
            <li>As you change modes by pressing a button on the toothbrush the smart guide shows an icon representing the mode; for instance a feather represents the sensitive mode and a diamond the whitening</li>
            <li>every 30 seconds to indicate when the recommended two minute brushing time is complete and the SmartGuide has a large quadrant icon showing the stages of brushing.</li>
            <li>The floss action brush head seems a little large, okay</li>
            <li>New handle feels better than previous model.  </li>
            <li>It has that little screen, that improves your cleaning experience. :)</li>
            <li>This is much more heavy duty than the older model.</li>
            <li>The Floss Action brush heads haven&#x27;t changed , but I do like the selection of 5 cleaning modes (regular clean, deep clean, sensitive, whitening, and massage).  </li>
            <li>However, I would not be willing to pay extra for the Smart Guide for an adult.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The timer is a smart innovation to help maintain a consistent standard of brushing.  </li>
            <li>LCD display that comes with the unit is a little overkill, but as some people said, it&#x27;s a good way to let you know how long you need to brush.&lt;br</li>
            <li>And even if I over brush or brush too hard or whatever, I don&#x27;t ever want a toothbrush that cuts off on its own again.  </li>
            <li>Some pastes create a lot more liquid than others while brushing, and you may find it tough to go a full 2 minutes without taking a break to spit it out.  </li>
            <li>Some pastes create a lot more liquid than others while brushing, and you may find it tough to go a full 2 minutes without taking a break to spit it out.  </li>
            <li>someone who travels frequently, I also really like that this unit came with a case for the toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I had tried all sorts of implements to clean the older units, and nothing could get at the scum and effectively clean it.</li>
            <li>It really feels like i&#x27;ve had a professional cleaning</li>
            <li>So far I really like this toothbrush</li>
            <li>Now I grasp why it felt sensitive so much of the time:  </li>
            <li>If you have sensitive gums then you should purchase the 5000 because there is a gentle mode.  </li>
            <li>It has one detraction for me in that it is much louder than my old cybersonic.  </li>
            <li>Has a few more features, like longer brushing etc...</li>
            <li>In a few days, I can tell my teeth and gums show improvement from better cleaning.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My dentist recommended this brush and I love it, especially the timer that keeps me disciplined about where to brush and for how long.  </li>
            <li>This toothbrush is so powerful that within 2 weeks of starting to use it I lost a 3 surface onlay that had been in my mouth since 1997.  </li>
            <li>My husband normally hates power toothbrushes</li>
            <li>I sometimes have trouble gripping it.  </li>
            <li>My dentist says my mouth is in the top 5 he looks into and was #2 until a few years ago when I reached my 60&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the extra $$$!</li>
            <li>I definitely recommend this product, worth the money.</li>
            <li>As my hygenist suggested, my teeth got somewhat more used to the vibration after using it for a few weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This toothbrush does a lot of extra stuff but its worth it all for your health.</li>
            <li>The SmartGuideA is a useful tool that adds to the overall experience.</li>
            <li>motor is powerful, especially when fully charged.</li>
            <li>At last I feel as though I am having fun while I am thoroughly cleaning my teeth</li>
            <li>normal, scrotum scrub, etc.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m constantly using the toothbrush throughout the day but the battery remains useful for about 4-5 days before I need to put it on the charger.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve owned a number of electric toothbrushes and the only two brands that are worth anything are Oral-B and Phillips.  </li>
            <li>I am glad that I made the switch to Oral B with this model which I admit is not cheap by all means.</li>
            <li>you own this unit and read the owner manual you realize the unit can be further customized to your personal liking by buying a different replacement head.</li>
            <li>Smart Guide itself was pretty easy to program, and it syncs up with the actual brush to display the amount of pressure you&#x27;re using, the mode (regular brushing, deep cleaning, etc.), and the number of seconds you&#x27;re spending on each of the four quadrants of your mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Many people get these super results in as little as two or three weeks when they start using the brush following a through professional treatment</li>
            <li>I stayed with same brand name, Oral B,  out of brand loyalty and I am pleased with all the new bells and whistles far different from my ancient electric tooth.  </li>
            <li>Also, it vibrated the most per second, not sure how much this matters, but I felt like I got the right one.</li>
            <li>No hard sell-just there to pique</li>
            <li>With no less than five settings on the toothbrush itself and a wireless timer that tells you exactly how long to spend brushing the four quadrants of your mouth, I&#x27;d say that this is a product worth recommending just on the strength of those features alone.</li>
            <li>There was a significant reduction in plaque after using just the normal mode and the deep cleaning mode came real close to that &amp;#34;just back from the dentist&amp;#34; feel.</li>
            <li>Since I am rotating this toothbrush with my older Triumph which is still going strong, this means that the battery would have lasted less than 1 year if I am using this toothbrush exclusively.    </li>
            <li>It also allows multiple members of the family to share the brush easily by putting a different head in for each family member.  </li>
            <li>so it can be less vigorous for more sensitive people</li>
            <li>only two complaints that I have about this purchase is that it did only come with one toothbrush, but I found other multi-pack brushes on Amazon for a good price.  </li>
            <li>I does a better job than lower priced electric toothbrushes due to a sonic action that aids the mechanical action in cleaning your teeth&lt;</li>
            <li>mouth / lower left bottom of mouth / and lower right bottom of mouth.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>I have had it for a little over 2 weeks and have never had a better clean and the size of the head along with the oscillating action ensures better tartar and plaque removal, especially in those hard to reach areas.  </li>
            <li>the first cleaning, I could tell a big difference compared to a manual toothbrush (which I had been using because my older one broke.)  </li>
            <li>enjoy using this product, and it appears to be extremely well made.  </li>
            <li>Is that the little clock / timer doesn&#x27;t have a way for it to stand on its own, they want you to stick it to the wall with double sided tape.</li>
            <li>I did not buy it originally because I was not sure it was the right tooth brush.</li>
            <li>When it was brand new, the battery lasted ~10 days as advertised.  </li>
            <li>The new version the rubber seems to be built into the handle.</li>
            <li>We like our new toothbrush a lot.  </li>
            <li>The new toothbrush has lights on the handle that you can see out of the corner of your eye and in the mirror.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m shopping for a new one now.</li>
            <li>It was time for a new one, so we got this -</li>
            <li>However, allthough I live in Singapore the propduct did not include Singaporean charger.</li>
            <li>* pause when going to a new mouth quadrant.</li>
            <li>I needed a new one and this meets my needs and exceed expectations.  </li>
            <li>As I live overseas, this is a problem.</li>
            <li>I do like this new toothbrush from Oral-B.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The new charger design is smarter, allowing for easier cleaning.</li>
            <li>the bells and whistle&#x27;s that the new one has</li>
            <li>I had to buy a new electric toothbrush when my Sonicare was lost at a hotel.  </li>
            <li>So I&#x27;ve bought new one.</li>
            <li>New one has some improvements</li>
            <li>new Precision 5000 has an updated SmartGuide that uses stars to indicate which quadrant you&#x27;re brushing (or supposed to be brushing) along with a smiley face that is always on with the clock.</li>
            <li>The Precision 5000 itself has a new look.</li>
            <li>If you have a SmartSeries 5000, you probably don&#x27;t need to upgrade to the new Precision 5000.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve been using it for almost a year, and it&#x27;s still working as new.</li>
            <li>The 1000 does not have a display but it does beep to notify you when to move to a new area.&lt;br /&gt;- Stained teeth.  </li>
            <li>From the performance, I guess my dentist will be asking what new is happening to my mouth.  </li>
            <li>and it is time to move on to a new quarter of your teeth.</li>
            <li>/&gt;There is a new design to the stand which keeps it plugged into the charger.</li>
            <li>/&gt;There is a new travel case which we appreciate since we do travel with our electric toothbrushes.</li>
            <li>/&gt;There is a new travel case which we appreciate since we do travel with our electric toothbrushes.</li>
            <li>but it didn&#x27;t include the latest brush from Phillips), so it really comes down to personal preference.  </li>
            <li>There is an easy to see red warning light to let you know when you&#x27;re brushing too hard.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;While the older models already have the essentials, this new brush clearly improves upon them.</li>
            <li>The 5000 have a few more modes, such as deep clean (just a longer cycle), and for massaging the gums.</li>
            <li>For worse the traveling case is so huge you shouldn&#x27;t expect to fit in a toiletry bag.</li>
            <li>So far I really like this thing and the default floss action head.</li>
            <li>Well, after one day of working, all of a sudden, my toothbrush had issues when the red led light will not go off.  </li>
            <li>This one will display a red light when the charge is getting low.</li>
            <li>But the main point seems to be to apply ultrasonic cleaning to your teeth, like your jeweler uses on old jewelry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I replaced a four year old unit only because I wanted the easy to switch out heads and the ability to use various brush styles.</li>
            <li>, much easier to get to the 2 minute mark, especially for people like me that have too much to do.  </li>
            <li>Did research on several different models and this one seemed to fit my needs.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think I would use the digital time counter, but after I used it a few times I actually liked it.</li>
            <li>and I can really get in there to the back teeth and really feel like I cleaned my mouth sufficiently, but it takes forever to charge and my battery is already going out</li>
            <li>I really enjoy the beep/brief pause at each 30 second interval that signifies for you to move to the next quarter of your mouth, as well as the timer.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had other electric brushes before and those they get the job done, I always liked the small powerful heads on the Oral-B ones.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this electric toothbrush with the caveat that it requires frequent head replacements.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;We would highly recommend the Oral-B Professional 5000.</li>
            <li>Bought as a replacement same brand and is very pleased with the upgrades old model was 6+ yrs old and used everyday by 2 adults</li>
            <li>In any case, the absence of drilling and scraping since Oral-B Professional products came in to my life makes this one of those rare unintentionally life-changing products.</li>
            <li>But for the first time, the new charger ONLY works in the US.  </li>
            <li>I like the fact that is does a great job of removing tartar from teeth but even on sensitive mode and regular brush head it still is tough on my gums and sides of cheeks.</li>
            <li>Super fun to use, no problems at all in the past</li>
            <li>It would be better if it had a small backlight though.  </li>
            <li>first time I used the toothbrush I noticed such a difference in the cleanliness of my teeth!  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have dual voltage that is necessary if you travel to most foreign countries, like the one I had before.</li>
            <li>After using my toothbrush for 1.5 years it stopped working, but Braun offers a 2 year warranty for this product!</li>
            <li>This was recommended by my husband who had used one for several years.... since it was first introduced on the market.  </li>
            <li>My first Oral-B finally reached the end of the road after 4.5 years and I had to get another one.</li>
            <li>My dentist actually gave me one of these with my first periodontal visit.</li>
            <li>my Oral-B. It&#x27;s like getting a professional cleaning every time I brush!</li>
            <li>After the first use of this I actually felt like I had visited the dentist because of the cleanliness feeling.</li>
            <li>My original Oral-B40 just recently died after 20 years of daily use by two people (crack at brushhead attachment, still works though)</li>
            <li>you are lazy, this toothbrush seems to do more of the work for you.  </li>
            <li>I miss my old brush!</li>
            <li>The adjunct display would seem to be superfluous at first, but it does focus one&#x27;s attention on thoroughly finishing each quadrant before moving on to the next.  </li>
            <li>So far, whew!  </li>
            <li>most other models only indicate if the battery needs to be charged (like immediately!).</li>
            <li>Last it has 5 modes, one of the reasons I bought it at first.</li>
            <li>The digital display is not really needed, but it is pretty cool to see the countdown....</li>
            <li>Thank you for that, but I&#x27;m only going to change my rating from a 2-star to a 4-star as this should not have happened in the first place.</li>
            <li>But I travel around the world for work, usually for weeks at a time, I would not be able to charge it.</li>
            <li>Purchased the original years ago, it lasted about 2-3 years before needing to be replaced due to being dropped (urgh).</li>
            <li>The engineer that came up with this concept should be slapped silly, in my honest opinion!  </li>
            <li>The engineer that came up with this concept should be slapped silly, in my honest opinion!  </li>
            <li>also you have different cleaning modes and it really brushes your teeth!</li>
            <li>I love that if I have a lazy day and don&#x27;t want to floss, after using this tooth brush, Its as if I flossed any way.</li>
            <li>This is my second Braun electric toothbrush (the first was not this model but a cheaper model I bought about 6 years ago)</li>
            <li>We expected a 5 day life out of a full charge.</li>
            <li>With this toothbrush, I can keep one eye on the little clock and it makes the time go by very quickly.</li>
            <li>The extra screen is a nice little gimmick to let you know how much time you have brushed your teeth.  </li>
            <li>I have a basic level Oral-B electric toothbrush and while it performed well it didn&#x27;t offer me much comfort with my main concern of receding gumlines.</li>
            <li>You could always start the 4000 cycle again if you want an equal to the deep clean mode</li>
            <li>teeth have never felt this clean before (other than leaving the dentists office.)  </li>
            <li>You also get a slick little LCD clock with a happy face that smiles when you&#x27;re brushing correctly, and frowns when you&#x27;re grinding the enamel off your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>While it does make my teeth whiter and clean, I stopped using it due to the fact that it irritates my teeth when using it.</li>
            <li>When the head is still new and fibers stiff and straight, the toothbrush does something special on teeth.  </li>
            <li>It cleans just as well as the old one and with this new one I do have a choice of speeds (which I didn&#x27;t have before).</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s a substantial improvement over the old Triumph, which didn&#x27;t perform that well even when new.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been an Oral-B fan for a while now, and I was eager to try out this new Precision 5000 after my old Oral-B&#x27;s power button gave up the ghost.</li>
            <li>But if you need a new electric toothbrush, I recommend the Oral-B Professional 5000.</li>
            <li>Well I was surprised to find upon first use that my teeth felt slick and clean, like they do after a dentist cleaning.</li>
            <li>I purchased a soft brush head and use it on regular speed with no ill effects.  </li>
            <li>I think it took about 2 days to charge the first time, but now it usually gets a full charge overnight.  </li>
            <li>My mouth feels very clean after every use, with very little effort.</li>
            <li>I read the reviews and was a little hesitant but was pleasantly surprised at how easy set up was without reading directions.&lt;br</li>
            <li>new SmartGuide is much better, with a hard pause between the 30-second intervals.</li>
            <li>I also like being able to dial down to a \\&quot;soft\\&quot; setting occasionally.</li>
            <li>Except for the second generation, there are positive improvements in each generation of the product.  </li>
            <li>You can set different settings (times), but regardless of the one chosen, you can always see exactly how much time you actually brushed.  </li>
            <li>New one has a hole that sits on a spike (missing in the original one) in the new adapter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It starts out giving strong brushing action, but after 2-4 uses, it drops and then it needs recharging again after a few days.</li>
            <li>It still, however, a tad harsh vibration wise although as stated have become slightly acustomed to it.</li>
            <li>As long as the inside of the heads and motion shaft are kept clean after every use the toothbrush has kept looking and acting like new over the duration of use thus far.</li>
            <li>The speed is just right, it displays the usage of the battery and slows down every 30 seconds to show how much time you are brushing your teeth.</li>
            <li>By actually monitoring a full two minutes of brushing and having it divide the time up into 4 equal lengths that I can use to give each quadrant of my mouth equal attention, my mouth is much cleaner and healthier than it was with a cheaper Oral-B toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>At over six bucks apiece, you could buy a whole new Cross Action brush for the cost of one refill head for this.</li>
            <li>The problem was in the packaging, which was fine except the adhesive tape was missing.</li>
            <li>It cleans well, it is easy to use, and holds enough charge to last several days.  </li>
            <li>The new Precision 5000 only came with a single Floss Action head, while my Triumph came with the same Floss Action head, and added a Sensitive head, a Power Tip head, Pro White head, and some kind of tongue cleaner head.  </li>
            <li>Seems large in the back of mine</li>
            <li>especially like the smart guide.</li>
            <li>The moment the toothbrush is turned on an icon on the smart guide shows which cleaning mode is currently being used.</li>
            <li>We feel certain that our&lt;br /&gt;dentist will see a difference on our next visit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is also easy to use a different style or model of brush for different areas of the mouth or different conditions, like you have tender areas or sensitive</li>
            <li>as it prevents the need for the user to keep watching the Smart Guide display (which can sometimes be difficult to see from a distance).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Precision 5000 series toothbrush, like all other Oral-B powered brushes I have used, does a splendid job of cleaning my teeth.  </li>
            <li>Teaching kids to brush, the SmartGuide may have some application, but for my purposes, it is of little more use than as a digital clock.  </li>
            <li>Teaching kids to brush, the SmartGuide may have some application, but for my purposes, it is of little more use than as a digital clock.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been told many times by the dentist that I brush too hard, this remedied that problem.  </li>
            <li>and I love the fact that it tells me when I&#x27;m brushing to hard.  </li>
            <li>At first I thought that this toothbrush, with its separate timer/clock was a little gimmicky, but after using it for several weeks, I&#x27;m very pleased with it.</li>
            <li>I never realized that I brushed too hard and this thing has really gotten me into better brushing habits.  </li>
            <li>Overall if you are trying to decide between the Oral B Professional 5000 and a Sonicare brush I would whole heartedly suggest going with Oral B -</li>
            <li>Also, my old Oral-B brush indicated how much charge was left by an icon on the brush.</li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive teeth and going to the dentist</li>
            <li>I use it on a daily basis to keep up with time as I get ready for the day.  </li>
            <li>Feels like I just walked out of the dentist office after having my teeth professionally cleaned.  </li>
            <li>We use the floss action and pro-white brushing heads.  </li>
            <li>I tried getting a replacement directly from Oral B under warranty</li>
            <li>About once a month,  I let the brush run completely out of batteries while running,  </li>
            <li>The old version seemed to glued on.</li>
            <li>I was told to be a responsible consumer and dispose of the battery properly.  </li>
            <li>and is using it with a Floss Action brush head.  </li>
            <li>I bought per my dentist&#x27; recommendation for my sensitive gums.  </li>
            <li>Out of the 5 brush modes, I&#x27;ve used regular (2 min), plus (3 min), and gum (gentle).</li>
            <li>seriously, it&#x27;s loud.</li>
            <li>kinda really loud &amp; noisy.  </li>
            <li>how I feel about the Floss Action Brush head.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s louder than my old one which takes some getting used to.</li>
            <li>My old oral b gave out after 8 years.  </li>
            <li>I was surprised.  </li>
            <li>yourself a favor, ask your dental professional but get started now.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s much easier to buy a set of replacement brush heads for BOTH, than it would be to have a different type for each toothbrush.</li>
            <li>The Floss action brush is awesome.&lt;br /&gt;Don</li>
            <li>It feels like you just had your teeth professionally cleaned each time you use it.</li>
            <li>As far as cleaning, I rate it 5</li>
            <li>; setting, the floss action head made my gums sore.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had my next dentist check-up yet, so that will be the real test.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have the old low-tech version</li>
            <li>It does not show a whole a lot information, and could be shrunk into a smaller form factor.</li>
            <li>Purchased as a replacement for an old Sonicare.  </li>
            <li>The included display also provides a way of knowing your progress and includes a clock which is definitely helpful when getting ready in the morning.  </li>
            <li>Before this I always overestimated the time and stopped brushing too early</li>
            <li>It feels like you just visited the dentist for a professional cleaning.  </li>
            <li>Wow, does it need to be this loud?  </li>
            <li>I feel like I&#x27;m getting a professional cleaning.  </li>
            <li>I also bought additional Oral-B Sensitive (extra-soft brush heads) for my husband who has sensitive gums.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve completely stopped using my sonicare toothbrush in favor of this one.</li>
            <li>Otherwise you don&#x27;t know how much charge is left.</li>
            <li>but I feel it won&#x27;t last much longer.  </li>
            <li>BUT beware, after just over ONE year the batteries quit completely and are NOT user-replaceable.  </li>
            <li>When my old Sonicare died, I did some research, and found this.</li>
            <li>i was really surprised with the power.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so professional, it&#x27;s unbelieveable.  </li>
            <li>Braun Triumph Professional Care</li>
            <li>On that alone, you&#x27;re doing yourself a favor by using any of the Braun/Oral-B professional series toothbrushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>On the plus side, the Precision 5000 brush actually lights up when you&#x27;re applying too much pressure.</li>
            <li>I really like the timer that keeps you on task to brush all quadrants for total of two minutes.</li>
            <li>I can really feel the difference and hopefully on my next dentist visit</li>
            <li>I am an engineer, so her giving up and my finally fixing whatever is not an unusual situation.  </li>
            <li>12 yr old doesn&#x27;t complain about brushing teeth</li>
            <li>After 2+ years of keeping my teeth completely cavity-free, I think this toothbrush deserves a review at least.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My teeth feel like I had a professional cleaning every day.</li>
            <li>I received a  dental professional version of this toothbrush in dentral school.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It feels gentler in your mouth than the Oral B and on sensitive teeth</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always wanted an aggressive, efficient and sensitive electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li>But darn it if the competition of getting four stars and a smiley face, don&#x27;t ensure that I push through a complete two-minute brushing each and every time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This is a professional tooth brush.</li>
            <li>The floss action does not replace the need to floss</li>
            <li>Toss out your old electric and manual brushes.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive teeth</li>
            <li>Also OralB has sensitive heads if I need them which I haven&#x27;t so far.  </li>
            <li>They must have used a battery recycled from an early 90s</li>
            <li>different brushing modes - polish, gentle, whitening,</li>
            <li>no cavities for this 40 year old.</li>
            <li>It took 1-2 weeks to get used to the floss action of the brush head.</li>
            <li>Floss Action Precision 5000 Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush</li>
            <li>/&gt;There&#x27;s still no way to set it to default to sensitive mode.</li>
            <li>I always use the sensitive mode.  </li>
            <li>To get to sensitive mode, you press the power button once and the mode change button twice.</li>
            <li>Wow.</li>
            <li>I ended up choosing the Oral-B 4000 (after trying the nearly identical 5000) and my wife prefers the Phillips Diamond Clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you have a sensitive mouth or are prone to headaches, this probably isn&#x27;t for you.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say I have a lot of use for the accessories (though I am thankful for the addition of a hard-plastic travel case) such as the \\&quot;SmartGuide,\\&quot; which really seems to be designed for parents of toddlers who are teaching their kids how to use a toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say I have a lot of use for the accessories (though I am thankful for the addition of a hard-plastic travel case) such as the \\&quot;SmartGuide,\\&quot; which really seems to be designed for parents of toddlers who are teaching their kids how to use a toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>I prefer the old method where you can see the charge level at all</li>
            <li>I prefer the Floss Action, but my wife uses the Sensitive</li>
            <li>dentist has seen improvement with these toothbrushes vs. the old SonicCare</li>
            <li>I prefer the Floss Action, but my wife uses the Sensitive</li>
            <li>dentist has seen improvement with these toothbrushes vs. the old SonicCare</li>
            <li>the Oral-B Professional and</li>
            <li>Now I&#x27;m the one singing the praises of the Oral-B Professional to my friends, relatives, and acquaintances.  .</li>
            <li>you don&#x27;t have sensitive teeth</li>
            <li>I decided to switch from the old fashion way of brushing your teeth</li>
            <li>I wonder why.&lt;br /&gt;I assume that Floss Action Precision 5000 does not work for cleaning.</li>
            <li>Zero problems with it so far.</li>
            <li>It cleans some spots much easier than a traditional or Sonicare brush.  </li>
            <li>The floss action tip that comes with the product takes getting used to.  </li>
            <li>I was tempted to upgrade to this model for some time, but was worried the rapid aggressive rotation would harm my sensitive gums.  </li>
            <li>he thought the Professional 5000 would give us more&lt;br /&gt;cleaning and flossing action.  </li>
            <li>that professional cleaning.  </li>
            <li>bought the Professional 5000 for his Christmas&lt;</li>
            <li>, it went directly into use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My old Triumph handle had an LCD display, to show battery level and charging status.  </li>
            <li>Floss Action Precision 5000 Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush]]</li>
            <li>Floss Action Precision 5000 Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush]]</li>
            <li>I would recommend using the sensitive mode until your get use to the brush.</li>
            <li>Overall, I really like it</li>
            <li>The old one that I have still works to this day.</li>
            <li>I feel like I&#x27;ve been to the dentist for a professional cleaning.</li>
            <li>, I read the reviews of the Oral-B Professional 5000 and decided to try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It is clunkier looking than the Philips, and noisier, but I really don&#x27;t need quiet while I brush my teeth anyway</li>
            <li>If you want simple practicality (really do I need to plug my toothbrush charger into a USB port?)</li>
            <li>My teeth are now much cleaner than while I was using a regular toothbrush</li>
            <li>Additionally, I would not recommend purchasing the floss action heads if you have sensitive</li>
            <li>/&gt;While I recommend the Oral B 5000, I would suggest using the 1000 if you do not have sensitive or stained teeth.  </li>
            <li>So then I went to pull the mount off the wall and throw it out, and that had already set in 10 minutes and nearly pulled the paint off the wall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This product has flossing action.  </li>
            <li>I just bought this toothbrush and so far I like it.</li>
            <li>For one thing, silly as it sounds, I&#x27;m motivated by the happy face that appears on the clock when i complete the two minutes and remains there until the next time I brush.</li>
            <li>I am switching out the brush heads for the sensitive teeth brush heads.</li>
            <li>Also, I like that the battery lasts pretty long.</li>
            <li>so really you only need 1 toothbrush and 4 brush heads.  </li>
            <li>This review was also updated on 9/07/12 after comparing it to the Oral-B Smartseries 5000 Professional Care model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;This model comes with the FLOSS ACTION head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The mode for floss action requires the use of the floss action head which is what comes with this model.</li>
            <li>It can be very tempting to skimp out on the amount of time dedicated to brushing, especially when rushing in the morning, but this system helps fight those temptations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had to replace my old oral b electric toothbrush after 15 years.  </li>
            <li>(so it&#x27;s over 5 years old)</li>
            <li>(you&#x27;d be surprised how many health issues are related to unhealthy teeth and gums) and smile.</li>
            <li>remote clock and timer is surprisingly useful.  </li>
            <li>The digital timer is ok, but not really an important feature to me.</li>
            <li>Replacement heads are expensive but worth the price of healthy teeth and fewer dentists visits.</li>
            <li>By now, the first unit barely holds the charge for 1 brushing, the second unit for a week, with 1 person using it.</li>
            <li>did find the pressure warning useful to start, as I was brushing my teeth harder than the toothbrush wanted.</li>
            <li>It is worth every penny spent</li>
            <li>I had to do trial and error with a few different brands to see which one I liked (Colgate Total seems to work</li>
            <li>I had to do trial and error with a few different brands to see which one I liked (Colgate Total seems to work</li>
            <li>I like the round heads a lot better than regular toothbrush heads like sonicare.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used a similar toothbrush for years and didn&#x27;t always brush the full two minutes because it seemed so long.</li>
            <li>in all, a good electric toothbrush set that you can&#x27;t go wrong with.</li>
            <li>Then again, considering the substantially lower cost of this new Precision 5000 model, compared to my high priced Triumph 9900 from 5 or more years ago, I guess I can see why they left out a few of the extra frills.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve been too cheap and lazy to buy a new one.</li>
            <li>The four sections represented are the upper left, upper right, lower left and lower right sides of your mouth.  </li>
            <li>as the right tool for the job.rants in your mouth, and that the physical feedback eliminates the need to watch the LCD display for visual indicators, I don&#x27;t appreciate the interruption in the brushing motion.  </li>
            <li>The pressure can be greater with no detection, or much less than too much and the tooth brush shuts down.  </li>
            <li>Only one really: the power runs down quite quickly (admittedly, my wife and I both use this brush) but it then takes FOR - E - VER to recharge.</li>
            <li>There are different modes (deep clean, sensitive, massage), but the standard mode works just as well.  </li>
            <li>That the deep clean mode is &#x27;only&#x27; brushing for extra time seems a cheat too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The clock/timer gives immediate easy to understand feedback even a small child could understand.</li>
            <li>It takes only a short period of time to see and feel the difference in your teeth and how clean your entire mouth feels.  </li>
            <li>I have used them all and use them all regularly except for the deep cleaning mode which is basically an extended daily clean mode.</li>
            <li>The basic speed for a daily clean seems to be the same.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The unit has five brushing modes to choose from (Daily Clean, Deep Clean, Sensitive, Whitening, and Massage) and even tells you when you&#x27;re brushing too hard.  </li>
            <li>You will be hooked from the start and with five different cleaning modes; daily ( recommended two-minute cleaning: 30 seconds per quadrum ), deep ( three minutes: 45 seconds per quadrum), sensitive, polishing and message,along with a variety of brush heads there is a sweet spot for just about everyone.</li>
            <li>In particular, this timer offers some confidence to parents whose kids are gradually moving toward fully independent brushing.</li>
            <li>/&gt;There are multiple options, the wireless smart guide is cool, works as a small time piece as well in the bathroom and shows the current mode and amount of time to brush each quadrant, not a necessary piece but a useful gadget to have.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t need &amp;#34;fancy shmancy,&amp;#34; get the next lower priced one that operates exactly the same so far as rotation goes.</li>
            <li>thought the Oral-B toothbrush would arrive with the full assortment of brush heads, but it only arrived with one brush head (unlike the Philips which had a larger and a smaller brush head).  </li>
            <li>Other than that, birds sing, plants grow, babies smile when you use this toothbrush.</li>
            <li>The kids feel that it brushes faster and more firmly than the other model and since they use a copy of the older model when they visit their father I think it isn&#x27;t just wishful thinking.</li>
            <li>The round head is bulky in my small mouth and I have a difficult time reaching all the spots I need to in order to ensure the perfect clean.</li>
            <li>I bought this as a replacement for an older model with the actual battery level display.</li>
            <li>After that first brushing I was left with the same feeling I get when I leave my dentists</li>
            <li>I was iffy on this particular design because the head is so much smaller.</li>
            <li>It also isn&#x27;t balanced correctly for a small hand and thus holding it isn&#x27;t that comfortable or natural.</li>
            <li>and I think I paid the same as I did for the older one a couple of years</li>
            <li>I personally have an older version, but just bought one for each of my Mom and sister.  </li>
            <li>I replaced an older Oral-B unit that I had used for several years.</li>
            <li>This classic Braun Oral-B is second to none...</li>
            <li>I recently purchased the Oral-B Precision 5000 to replace an older model Oral-B electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Summary: If you have a big hand, big mouth, and don&#x27;t mind waiting for it to fully charge (over 12 hours), then this is for you ;)  </li>
            <li>When my original Oral B 5000 broke (due to me dropping it several times)</li>
            <li>From past esperience I know that it gets your teeth cleaner which helps to equal a better check up at the dentist.  </li>
            <li>far as quality of brushing, this is exactly what I expected from Oral B.</li>
            <li>Unlike other products, the nearest service center is more than a 10-drive and they advised I needed to ship my entire brush with accessories to Massachusetts (I live in VA).  </li>
            <li>My teeth have never felt this clean on a daily basis with any other brush, manual or electric.</li>
            <li>I did everything right as I used to fill out mail-in-rebate form for other people when I was doing retail.</li>
            <li>Then, after having a cavity filled after a checkup only 2 weeks earlier, my dentist noted surprise at build up in the short time since she had last seen me.</li>
            <li>It is constructed of high quality materials and has a durable, solid feel to it.</li>
            <li>Failing that, I may have to go back to the old faithful Vitality and just use the new brush head and put up with recharging ever 3-4 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They sell 6 different brush heads in all, one is for sensitive teeth which is new.</li>
            <li>If you are making the transition from a manual and/or less powerful battery operated brush you may want to consider purchasing some of the sensitive replacement heads to start with.  </li>
            <li>If you are using too much pressure, a red light appears on both the brush and the guide display -- I found that I was brushing hard way too often</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t hurt to have a couple additional packs sent when they&#x27;re cheaper than usual, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Going back to welcome design changes, Oral-B has got away from the massive Braun plug that they used on previous models (and still use on Braun shavers) and instead uses a normal North American plug.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The main reason I went for a new one was that the battery was only lasting 3-4 days after a charge</li>
            <li>/&gt;It provides a real reality check on how long you should be brushing your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so you can go on brushing as long as you like without restarting a whole cycle.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The majority of the ones I own have been Oral-B mostly because they have been the least expensive on the market but all of them have been compatible with the brush heads.  </li>
            <li>After he got home and used for first time, he called me to grill just how much I spent as I am on a strict budget.</li>
            <li>first difference is the addition of the remote receiver.</li>
            <li>The SmartGuide works as a normal digital clock for your bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>(you&#x27;d be surprised how many health issues are related to unhealthy teeth and gums) and smile.from (Daily Clean, Deep Clean, Sensitive, Whitening, and Massage) and even tells you when you&#x27;re brushing too hard.  </li>
            <li>I noticed less plaque after first use!</li>
            <li>The back cover for the smart clean receiver was hard to get off.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had much success with the display unit, it seemed to never turn off and was always counting down.</li>
            <li>the Smart Guide can actually be helpful in giving feedback to encourage proper brushing.</li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t a big deal to me, but may provide positive reinforcement for those who find it hard to go the full 2 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The shape of the Sonicare brush head is way better to reach in the back and on the sides of those hard to reach area.</li>
            <li>My favorite features are when it lights up when you brush too hard, and the *very brief</li>
            <li>It was clear in the product information that both the round and flat brush heads fit.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Another thing I like is that when you press too hard is does not pause like the older one did, it just has a red light to let you know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After replacing it 3 different times over the years because it wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge, I decided I would try a new product and purchased the Oral-B.  </li>
            <li>Now that I say that.....being a new user, the accessory actually did help me get started.</li>
            <li>If mine goes tits up tomorrow, I with be picking up a new one by mid morning.</li>
            <li>The Triumph series would do a brief pause in between quadrants (you&#x27;re supposed to spend 30 seconds in each quadrant of your mouth), where the new Precision series stops and chirps like</li>
            <li>Please consider this toothbrush the next time you need to get a new one.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The new 5000 also uses an audible beep every 30 seconds along with Oral B&#x27;s traditional pause.</li>
            <li>With the new version, the display is gone, and has been replaced by LED lights (in 3 different increments).  </li>
            <li>my account, the entire unit to Quebec (I live in Vancouver, BC).</li>
            <li>(This is a new charger design than the former 5000 series model had, that one could be used in Europe.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It sounds great to have all these options, but from the toothbrush itself it is impossible to know what mode you are in.  </li>
            <li>My teeth feel quite incredibly clean after using it, and during my last dentist visit they remarked that I had a lot less plaque than usual.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I spend 1 whole day charging it up and only get to use the toothbrush for 2 days before the battery is totally discharged.  </li>
            <li>charger takes about 12 hours to fully charge, so every two weeks or whenever the brush indicator shows a battery charge needed, I set the brush on the charger over the day or over night and it is ready to go when needed.&lt;br/&gt;Current research in dental and medical literature shows a correlation to gum disease and overall health.  </li>
            <li>They are only supposed to last for 10 years, and I got 15, so I couldn&#x27;t really complain.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive teeth and thought I would need to use the sensitive setting on a regular basis.</li>
            <li>It follows and guides your brushing, and while the effect is only psychological, it really makes a difference.</li>
            <li>My teeth don&#x27;t look whiter or anything, but I know exactly how long I&#x27;ve brushed my teeth!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a child but brushing with a regular toothbrush never resulted in all my teeth getting cleaned, so the audio and visual aids in brushing really do the trick for me.</li>
            <li>The remote timer thing is just an over the top unneccessary piece of glam, in my humble opinion.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t need a count-down (or count-up, depending on your taste) timer to know when I&#x27;ve brushed my teeth enough.  </li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t need a count-down (or count-up, depending on your taste) timer to know when I&#x27;ve brushed my teeth enough.  </li>
            <li>You are even presented with a big smiley face, to give you that extra sense of pride in what you have accomplished.  </li>
            <li>I had gingivitis and it has reversed it quickly after just a few weeks of using this toothbrush.</li>
            <li>The travel case fit nicely in my carry-on suitcase holding 2 brush heads and the base.</li>
            <li>Have used the 5000 for a month and find the cleaning action is more robust than ever without irritating my gums.</li>
            <li>After finally charging, I was already skeptical but wanted to give the Oral-B a chance at working as good as my Sonicare...  </li>
            <li>Essentially, the secondary button&#x27;s physical location makes it very easy to press accidentally.  </li>
            <li>then I started noticing the red light that would light up when it senses you&#x27;re brushing too hard, lighting up even when I&#x27;m applying little pressure.&lt;br /&gt;Then</li>
            <li>/&gt;Unboxing the new product, and now after using it for the past month, I can honestly say that it is extremely similar to my previous Triumph model Oral-B device.  </li>
            <li>As far as the smart guide, I concur with some of the other reviewers.  </li>
            <li>It removes plaque like no other.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used the normal and sensitive settings but both work well and are noticeably different.</li>
            <li>/&gt;just combine it with Crest 3D white Luxe advance vivid</li>
            <li>I mean, come one, who keeps a toothbrush instruction manual within easy reach???  </li>
            <li>As someone who has used a traditional toothbrush for her entire life, I was astounded at how much cleaner my entire mouth felt after using the Oral B Professional toothbrush.</li>
            <li>in brief, a great product but a disappointment as I&#x27;m not enjoying the full experience.</li>
            <li>While I loved that old model, my one complaint was that the battery didn&#x27;t hold a very sizable charge, and with age it just got worse -- at the time of my replacing it, it was only holding enough charge for about 2 brushings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enter the new Oral-B Smartseries 5000 Professional Care Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush....</li>
            <li>So, after the first thirty seconds you get a very short pause, with a single beep.  </li>
            <li>So, after the first thirty seconds you get a very short pause, with a single beep.  </li>
            <li>I usually blow off the smart guide and brush all over for over 3 minutes, the smart guide made me go over it all again.</li>
            <li>After just two weeks my gums showed significant improvement, as well as, whatever showed such improvement between my teeth and the stains from drinking tea and coffee everyday-</li>
            <li>I live in New York but the nearest service center is in Watertown, MA.  </li>
            <li>i like that the small head is able to get behind my back molars easily.</li>
            <li>The little smiley face on the timer is fun and the brush beeps after 30 seconds or 45, depending on what brushing cycle you chose, then after your brushing time is up</li>
            <li>This little toothbrush is worth its price.  </li>
            <li>and they probably were a little upset that I was having success.  </li>
            <li>Anyways after a few months of my teeth not feeling clean enough I decided to go ahead and buy this.</li>
            <li>also shows the current brushing program (which is another addition), and the current time, bu the main attraction is getting the smiley face on it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I bought his to replace an older model Braun OralB Plaque Remover 3D that I got back in 2001 which finally gave up the ghost.</li>
            <li>Oral B now requires you to do an extra press of the mode button to get into the sensitive/feather mode (2 total) versus 1 with the older 5000.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall:</li>
            <li>Without the external Smart Guide, there is no way to tell how long have you been brushing your teeth.  </li>
            <li>The Smart Guide allows the brush to pause every 30 seconds per quadrant to ensure that I brush long enough.  </li>
            <li>I had no idea that I was brushing too hard, so the warning light is great.&lt;br</li>
            <li>brush has a warning light if you push too hard on your teeth, which is useful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Aside from the fairly large handle the unit is pretty solid but without excessive weight.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really not that big of a deal to me because I store my toothbrush on the dock anyway, so I just have to plug it in a little more often.  </li>
            <li>In any case, the absence of drilling and scraping since Oral-B Professional products came in to my life makes this one of those rare unintentionally life-changing products.n changes, Oral-B has got away from the massive Braun plug that they used on previous models (and still use on Braun shavers) and instead uses a normal North American plug.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I suspect many people out there would benefit from it instructing them in how long they should brush each quadrant and the alert if one is brushing too hard.</li>
            <li>On top of that is bigger and heavier than other models and hence less practical.</li>
            <li>The timer is nice feature, as well as the indicator that shows if you are pressing down too hard.  </li>
            <li>I had a slightly older model (can&#x27;t remember which) that I was replacing because it did not hold a charge very long anymore.</li>
            <li>Upon delivery of the new item I noticed that the Smart Guide LED display/clock was missing.</li>
            <li>The product has a primary button that turns the unit on/off, and a secondary button that causes it to jump from mouth-zone to mouth-zone.  </li>
            <li>Just get one and use it for life, your teeth and general health will thank you.</li>
            <li>I have a small mouth and this brush is comfortable for brushing even the back teeth.</li>
            <li>Very simply to use, controls an indicators are clear.</li>
            <li>Capitalism at it&#x27;s finest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product itself is sound, but just be aware that you&#x27;re purchasing something with a battery that will eventually fail.</li>
            <li>/&gt; As far as  complaints of the batteries not lasting long:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The Professional line has various toothbrush options for just about any of your oral hygiene needs.  </li>
            <li>After the 3 years, it only lasts for 2 uses before completely dying.  </li>
            <li>Gee, I just realized that my old 1,000 series had a deep cleaning mode, too.</li>
            <li>All three are designed for different conditions, I suggest visiting your health professional and trying out the choices.  </li>

            <li>When I recently purchased this Oral-B Professional toothbrush, I had no idea</li>
            <li>but apparently I made a mistake.</li>
            <li>The mechanical action Oral B uses is very different from Sonicare.</li>
            <li>It was FINALLY time to replace our old one.  </li>
            <li>teeth are also somewhat sensitive, so I have avoided electric toothbrushes until recently, when I tried a Sonicare.  </li>
            <li>, there are additional options, for deep cleaning, sensitive teeth, etc.</li>
            <li>There were several times when my old toothbrush would accidentally be activated in my bag and the battery would run out.</li>

            <li>2+ minute brushings before the power is very low and the brush action is dramatically weaker.  </li>
            <li>toothbrush is easy to clean and  the base does not take up much space.  </li>
            <li>The only complain I have is when you reach 2 minutes it stops completely for about 1 or 2 seconds and then starts again.</li>
            <li>The light is green when charged, and flashes red when the battery is low.  </li>
            <li>But the whirling brush does splatter toothpaste around if you are not careful.</li>
            <li>No regrets with this purchase.</li>
            <li>I even purchased my kids the Oral-B 3d White Action Rechargeable Toothbrush.</li>
            <li>It is kind of expensive though</li>
            <li>I put two fresh alkaline batteries in the monitor when I received it in June of lastyear, and this week they are dead.</li>
            <li>I was delighted when I found that I could remove the charger from the stand which seems to me to be a counter space waster and awkward to use.</li>
            <li>I am telling you, it is like the most irritating thing I have ever seen in a product, and my wife agrees.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>And I&#x27;ve had kudos from my own dentist for less plague and damage from brushing too hard.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really see much difference between this one and the more expensive one so for $20 less</li>
            <li>The toothbrush head tray has a cover that folds down to keep dust and other random things off it it; this is wonderful for my inner germophobe.  </li>

            <li>/&gt;After originally buying the brush, I had read about charging issues and thought that it could be overcome with careful charging (i.e. only putting it on the charger when the unit was empty, not after each brushing.</li>
            <li>Wireless SmartGuide thingy is a little difficult to get set up (at least it was for me), but having the timer &amp; being able to see how long I need to spend in each area is great.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m still trying to give it a chance, but as of right now I&#x27;m not real thrilled with the purchase.  </li>
            <li>useful aspect of the external display is that there is an indicator which lights up red when the brush detects that you are brushing too hard (if you&#x27;re putting too much pressure on the brush).  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I have always been lectured from dentists for brushing too hard in one particular location - where I always start brushing first.  </li>
            <li>I usually use the deep clean and the massage mode.</li>
            <li>His toothbrush did not last nearly as long as mine did,  and mine was older than his was.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Well, truth be told, our teeth and gums look and feel much cleaner with two minutes of use with this brush than five minutes with any other brush.  </li>
            <li>That among other reasons resulted in this purchase, and I was really amazed at the difference now that I am using this powered toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve owned my share of electric dental appliances (Waterpiks, Sonicares, other Oral B brushes), but this really is the creme de la creme.  </li>
            <li>We have bought additional brushes for the other functions and they all work very well.  </li>
            <li>It cleans extremely welll and fast.  </li>
            <li>The other three are absolutely made up and have no practical use.</li>
            <li>Thanks a lot, but switching to other brand.</li>
            <li>The floss action has some flat plastic pieces instead of being all brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The floss action has some flat plastic pieces instead of being all brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>like the red light that comes on when you&#x27;re brushing too hard.</li>
            <li>Some of the attachments - wireless smartguide, which is not only to help you brush the recommended two minutes, but also \\&quot;light up\\&quot; if you brush too hard - feel like overkill, meant to justify the $100</li>
            <li>you brush too hard, a red light flashes on both the toothbrush and the display..</li>
            <li>This one also has a red light to warn when brushing too hard.</li>
            <li>The other complaint is that it seems like it takes the toothbrush a considerable amount of time to recharge and the battery does not seem to last for more than about 10-12 brushes before it needs to be recharged.</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t keep it very long, but at least I don&#x27;t have to look at that vapid happy face.</li>
            <li>5 years old Oral-B (some old and less professional model) has passed away, after serving me loyally&lt;br</li>
            <li>[[ASIN:B008PEMBNC Oral-B Professional Precision 1000 Rechargeable Toothbrush]], which is basically the same brush, but without the external display.  </li>
            <li>My wife has a Sonicare toothbrush that provides a really short stutter in brushing action every 30 seconds, which doesn&#x27;t interrupt the brushing process, but provides enough feedback to alert the user that another 30 seconds has passed.  </li>
            <li>My wife has a Sonicare toothbrush that provides a really short stutter in brushing action every 30 seconds, which doesn&#x27;t interrupt the brushing process, but provides enough feedback to alert the user that another 30 seconds has passed.  </li>
            <li>Normally I wouldn&#x27;t think to spend $100 on a toothbrush, but since my last one had lasted so long, I thought what the heck.  </li>
            <li>They market this same basic device called  Oral-B Smartseries 5000 Professional Care Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush that has the precision cleaning brush head.</li>
            <li>I do use the SmartGuide so that I know when to move to the next quadrant of my mouth, although at times I&#x27;ve brushed considerably longer than the preset</li>
            <li>You just move from tooth to tooth slowly for perfectly clean</li>
            <li>This toothbrush is by far the most expensive model toothbrush I have ever owned.  </li>
            <li>Where the Sonicare left things on my teeth, and i was kind of difficult to get on the inside, this toothbrush does thoroughly.</li>
            <li>I go from tooth to tooth slowly, applying a little pressure at the gum line of each and find that it takes exactly 30 seconds to clean each quadrant.  </li>
            <li>If you have a grill full of aged dental work, this toothbrush could wreak havic if you don&#x27;t use one of the settings to tone it down a notch or two.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My kids were brushing lazily and quickly; it was starting to impact their check ups, so we purchased this, and put the timer up on their mirror.  </li>
            <li>know that this brush is of high quality and that it will last a long time, but if you don&#x27;t need all the extra features, a lower-priced model will probably suit your needs just as well.</li>
            <li>Price isn&#x27;t bad and the product is amazing!</li>
            <li>At least Oral B could send a box (like many other companies) and pay the shipping costs.  </li>
            <li>And, while on the topic of charging, this also has lights that show you how much the toothbrush has charged, which is not present on the other \\&quot;Vitality\\&quot; series toothbrush.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I only ever use the highest speed mode anyway, and don&#x27;t really see a purpose for the other modes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is a dim grey LED display on a gray background.  </li>
            <li>The only regret is that it looked exactly the same other model I have bought last year</li>
            <li>I usually use the sensitive setting because my gums are sensitive to the normal setting.</li>
            <li>If it lasts as long as I do I will have completely forgotten about the price.</li>
            <li>We will see if this one lasts as long as my old one did.  </li>
            <li>My last one barely made it to one year.</li>
            <li>I tell her that I introduced the Flintsones to the Jetsons long ago and switched to the Oral B with the Floss Action</li>
            <li>The first few times I used this Oral B, I felt like I had been to the dentist.</li>
            <li>multiple settings on the toothbrush are the second most irritating feature on a product ever.  </li>
            <li>It just works as described, but it needs to be recharged at least every 2 days (reason of not letting 5 stars) to keep it working at full speed all the time.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve owned a few oral-b electric toothbrushes over the last few decades and have enjoyed them all.  </li>
            <li>Otherwise buy one with less features and no \\&quot;Smart</li>
            <li>When I&#x27;m down to one square and plug it up for recharging it takes the whole day to fully charge.</li>
            <li>At first glance, even down to the accessories, it looks nearly identical to the old model, barring an LED-based display on the brush-body rather than the LCD used previously, functions almost identically, and even takes the same heads.</li>
            <li>I had the older version of this toothbrush and used the non oral b replacement heads and felt they did not work as well as the other.  </li>
            <li>While I really like this product and recommend it highly, the one beef I have is with the location of the secondary button.  </li>
            <li>I should have dumped my old one a long time ago!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if other brands are better or worse, but for me, I am sticking with my old fashion toothbrush as opposed to a brushing device like this one.  </li>
            <li>: while I liked the cleaning of the Oral-B, like the timer, like the color rings for multiple users, the price/value relationship does not work, due to the poor battery.</li>
            <li>My old Oral-B was no longer holding a charge very long</li>
            <li>you can reduce this by taking the brush head off after every use, rinsing it out then shaking it dry.. but to completely eliminate the mildew, I wash out the brush heads in hydrogen peroxide every couple of weeks which seems to work well.  </li>
            <li>remote display works really well, shows how long you&#x27;ve brushing and has 4 quadrants that fill up after 30 seconds of brushing.</li>
            <li>I only hope this one lasts as long as the old one.</li>
            <li>Only a round brush seems logical to me.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Only a round brush seems logical to me.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s worth all the money compared to a regular toothbrush.</li>
            <li>The battery indicator is fairly useless as it will still show a full or 2/3 charge when the brush really needs to be charged to avoid it being sluggish.  </li>
            <li>The round head is OK for a small mouth</li>
            <li>not sure if they actually do anything, but they are fun.  </li>
            <li>First off, it took a few times to get use to the idea of staying in a quadrant until it tells you to move on to the next.  </li>
            <li>not sure it&#x27;s worth the extra cash, but I do like the timer.</li>
            <li>the wow factor was limited.</li>
            <li>Switched back from Sonicare to Oral B as I find the small round toothbrushes better remove plaque for me.  </li>
            <li>the light will turn red if you&#x27;re brushing too hard!</li>
            <li>I naturally ordered another and hope to get half of what the old one did.</li>
            <li>This whole thing confused me at first, so I will repeat: the units are the same and they both have different cleaning modes but for each thing you need a different head, each are purchased separately.</li>
            <li>The timer is a nifty little thing that activates the moment the toothbrush is activated and even tells you when you&#x27;re applying too much pressure as you brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really want some little device giving me smiley faces when I brush well.  </li>
            <li>It is highly dependent on angle and such of the brush and where or how this tooth brush determines the over brushing is not right.  </li>
            <li>I prefer that over the new &#x27;floss&#x27; or other head.</li>
            <li>My other Braun toothbrush battery died so I went on the hunt for a new one.  </li>
            <li>New toothbrush fits in the other one but does not charge.  </li>
            <li>The older one would decrease in power as the battery ran down, this one holds the charge evenly until it wears out-</li>
            <li>Its fun to brush now and let the electric motor do all the hard work.</li>
            <li>The floss action really works for hard to reach teeth.</li>
            <li>I find that by setting it high on a shelf it is out of the way, and looking up at it keeps toothpaste foam from running down my chin.</li>
            <li>Great toothbrush, but the lack of a dual voltage charger is stupid.  </li>
            <li>It actually gently massages the gums while cleaning, and for me, this is working well even in a delicate crown area where the gum has prior recession and which used to feel mildly sensitive throughout the day.  </li>

            <li> Awesome toothbrush, cleans so much better than a manual.</li>
            <li> After some stern lectures from my dentist and hygienist that I have to pay more attention to my brushing, I decided to do some research on the best toothbrush I can get.&lt;br</li>
            <li> they could sell it with more brushes in the kit, then the product might be perfect.</li>

            <li> Veeery good product.</li>
            <li> A choice of intensity seems good for sensitivity.</li>
            <li> Good value for the money and lasts longer than Sonic toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li> loved my Sonicare for years and years.  </li>
            <li> Battery life has been good.  </li>
            <li> We are delighted with the performance and the way it makes your teeth feel.  </li>
            <li> I loved the product.</li>
            <li> To be fair</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t have a clue if it is good or not.</li>
            <li> Good buy.</li>
            <li> Its best to allow the brush head to do its job with light pressure.  </li>
            <li> my dentist said my teeth are looking really good</li>
            <li> my dentist loves my good checkups from using a power brush</li>
            <li> I wonder what designer thought thisi was a good idea.</li>
            <li> The product is good.</li>
            <li> gums are looking so good now.</li>
            <li> it was a good buy.</li>
            <li> Returning this toothbrush despite its good reviews.</li>
            <li> My dentist has remarked on how good my oral hygiene is now...</li>
            <li> No joke, they are that good.</li>
            <li> a good amount of time to spend brushing.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Good toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m  delighted with my purchase of the Oral B electric took brush.  </li>
            <li> I never thought in a million years I would be writing a review for an electric toothbrush, but the Oral B Precision 5000 is about as good as it gets.  </li>
            <li> Good oral hygiene is a must in our family.  </li>
            <li> It was avery good investment.</li>
            <li> good deal too.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say enuf good about this coupled with water pic.  </li>
            <li> I guess this is as good as it gets.  </li>
            <li> Once you use it you realize you can not do as good a job by manual brushing.</li>
            <li> Good Product I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> I like the toothbrush as it has done a good job cleaning my familes teeth.  </li>
            <li> The prongs do a good job of removing food particles between the teeth but take some getting used to.  </li>
            <li> Incredible, my teeth have never looked better.</li>
            <li> All the modes feel good to use.</li>
            <li> Good product</li>
            <li> as described -- though I expect that to diminish as the unit ages as rechargeable batteries aren&#x27;t good forever (and are NOT replaceable despite the fact they are removable.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but gum issues do run in my family -- hopefully with a good oral health plan including this brush</li>
            <li> In fact, they saw how good my teeth were doing</li>
            <li> charger is good and the timer is good&lt;br /&gt;Recommend to all</li>
            <li> the good reviews states.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> My teeth feel so good after brushing now.  </li>
            <li> The handle is waterproof, and has a good rubbery grip surface.  </li>
            <li> The pros I talked with say Oral-B is the best toothbrush available.</li>
            <li> Seems petty, but if it works, that&#x27;s good for my teeth.  </li>
            <li> As good as I had hoped.  </li>
            <li> I have found the Braun Oral B toothbrushes to be of consistently good quality.  </li>
            <li> Since I bought this, my dentist has seen good result when I go in for my appointments.</li>
            <li> I then decided to buy a good electric toothbrush based off a recommendation from a friend.  </li>
            <li> Maybe I have been unlucky, but as good as Braun&#x27;s are, I think they have a design problem.</li>
            <li> A very useful item and performs great cleaning!!</li>
            <li> Excellent purchase, well worth it!</li>
            <li> Love it - always thought I did a good job brushing until I used this!  </li>
            <li> it works wonderful and my teeth feel as clean as when I go to the dentist.</li>
            <li> Works wonderful, leaving teeth squeeky clean.</li>
            <li> I think it does a wonderful job of keeping your teeth clean.</li>
            <li> 10 years+ of loyal service!!!</li>
            <li> The timer helping you to brush in each quadrant of your mouth to make sure you cover all areas is a great idea.  </li>
            <li> As shown by most reviews, this is a great brush.  </li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> Great i love it works like a charm</li>
            <li> This was well worth the cost and this brand is the best I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li> I also never thought I&#x27;d spend $100 on a toothbrush, but I&#x27;m very glad I did.  </li>
            <li> I am very pleased with its performance.  </li>

            <li> I am VERY glad I invested the money.  </li>
            <li> Been using this toothbrush for 2 months now and I am very satisfied with it.  </li>

            <li> I loved it so much my wife bought one for herself and she has been equally impressed.</li>
            <li> What a great clean feeling!</li>
            <li> My two minutes and this clocks two minutes sure do differ!  </li>
            <li> I had to convince him to try it because he was sure nothing could replace his &amp;#34;old faithful&amp;#34;!</li>
            <li> At first I didn&#x27;t know why he got it for me because I was very happy with my Sonicare toothbrush that I&#x27;ve been using for about 10 years now.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love my Oral-B electric toothbrush!  </li>

            <li> Gramps and me love this bells whistling model for our oral care!</li>
            <li> This toothbrush does an excellent job helping me make sure i clean all of my teeth.</li>
            <li> It has a strong motor, and feels great on my teeth.</li>
            <li> The directions were great and easy to understand.</li>
            <li> This is so easy to use and my teeth and gums feel great.</li>
            <li> Every time I use it, I feel like I&#x27;m at the dentist, except its a much more pleasant experience.</li>
            <li> it works great and it was available at a great price.&lt;br /&gt;it is easy to operate and understand.&lt;br /&gt;thank</li>
            <li> to the Smart guide, this would be an excellent feature for kids.  </li>
            <li> The clock is very nice and easy to switch mode.</li>
            <li> Very good and worth the money.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is amazing.</li>
            <li> It cleans my teeth amazingly, but you may as well have a gas powered toothbrush with the amount of noise this thing makes.  </li>
            <li> This toothbrush is simply amazing.</li>
            <li> The Oral-B Triumph 5000 Electric Tooth brush has been an amazing product.</li>
            <li> Absolutely amazing.  </li>
            <li> This toothbrush is great, I see fantastic results.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s amazing</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is amazing.</li>
            <li> Amazon&#x27;s frustration free packaging was great - Oral-B needs to take some tips from them.  </li>
            <li> but I will say that I believe this 5000 is a nice improvement over the Triumph,  </li>
            <li> My family found the clock amusing.  </li>
            <li> I did want bristles that where longer like a do it yourself toothbrush but am very happy I tried it anyways because I really quite like what it came with.</li>
            <li> We now own two of these two brushes.  </li>
            <li> It comes with a nice travel case.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice practical touch to see the time when the timer is not running while brushing your teeth.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s nice</li>
            <li> Nice to have that in bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The carrying case is nice, too.</li>
            <li> I honestly can&#x27;t think of any cons...</li>
            <li> travel case is handy.</li>
            <li> You also don&#x27;t need it in order to travel with your toothbrush, which is nice.</li>
            <li> The timer is nice.</li>
            <li> Probably not but it does keep you honest if you try to brush for two minutes.  </li>
            <li> Have had an Oral B before and liked it a lot.</li>
            <li> As one person said, it does make a nice bathroom clock.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s nice to have a clock in the bathroom.</li>
            <li> One of the nice things about this unit is that it comes with a rechargeable battery.</li>
            <li> The battery powered display is also a nice addition</li>
            <li> It has been much more than great, it has been fantastic!  </li>
            <li> Ability to change the speed of the brush is nice.  </li>
            <li> I am totally loving it and have recommended it to all my friends.</li>
            <li> but I wanted to do my own research.  </li>
            <li> It also makes for a nice bathroom clock.</li>
            <li> /&gt;the screen is nice</li>
            <li> Plus its nice to change it up every now and then.</li>
            <li> The timer works really nicely, and it functions as a clock when you&#x27;re not brushing.</li>
            <li> and it is a nice feature.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This was a nice upgrade</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been great, and my last visit to the dentist was perfect.</li>
            <li> The timer is nice too.  </li>
            <li> I found the Oral-B effective in preventing that from happening.  </li>
            <li> It really is the best electric toothbrush I&#x27;ve had.</li>
            <li> I love getting a good cleaning in 2 minutes.</li>
            <li> and we each have our own brush heads.</li>
            <li> The travel case has been handy, but you have to remove the brush and store both pieces side by side in the case.</li>
            <li> Glad we saw all the good reviews and decided to try it.</li>
            <li> Effective at Oral Hygiene...</li>
            <li> This models is especially fun because of the clock.  </li>
            <li> The timer doubles as a handy bathroom clock.</li>
            <li> It honestly feels like I&#x27;ve been to the dentist each time I brush.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is amazingly effective.</li>
            <li> The wireless connection between the toothbrush and timer is handy.</li>
            <li> Great product, I think I will never come back to manual brushing. : )!!!!</li>
            <li> but he was thrilled.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush also has its own battery indicator (3 levels) --</li>
            <li> I own both toothbrushes, and here are the differences between the two:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The timer keeps you honest</li>
            <li> This thing really does the best job of brushing</li>
            <li> It is nice that there is a timer that comes with it.</li>
            <li> LIKED THE COMPACT SIZE--THE HANDY CLOCK</li>
            <li> It comes with a handy clock -</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s really handy to have in the bathroom when you are wondering what the time is;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s great - still working perfectly 2 years later</li>
            <li> The head fits nicely in the mouth and around each tooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have used a cybersonic for about 20 years and really liked it.....until it died.  </li>
            <li> Oral-B really is the best out there.</li>
            <li> If you have problem with receding gums, this indicator comes in handy.  </li>
            <li> I never had this kind of toothbrush before</li>
            <li> Keeps you honest</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really nice - keeps me brushing and brushing correctly.</li>
            <li> The time is cool and its easy to find the attachment/brush heads and it works great!!</li>
            <li> The pressure indicator is a great feature, I still haven&#x27;t changed the original head on the toothbrush yet, which it has been a while.</li>
            <li> It is worth it!!!</li>
            <li> Great Product and make my teeth feel so clean.</li>
            <li> It makes your mouth feel so clean, and the timer is a great feature.</li>
            <li> This is a great product to use for keeping your teeth clean and will reduce the time for the annual dentist cleaning.  </li>
            <li> Works great and makes my teeth feel really clean.  </li>
            <li> My teeth feel great - as clean as a dental cleaning!I</li>
            <li> This is an excellent machine, and I highly recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> Best toothbush I have ever used, would highly recommend to all</li>
            <li> Highly recommended, and the Amazon.com \\&quot;Frustration Free\\&quot; packaging on this unit is a welcome addition!</li>
            <li> It works a treat and leaves ur teeth feeling dentist clean!!</li>
            <li> middle-of-the-road Oral-B toothbrush is probably fine for most folks, but if you catch this model on sale or with a rebate it should be a brush that your dentist is happy about you using.</li>
            <li> The new version has been tweaked and they are all for the best.</li>
            <li> It is an excellent product which keeps on improving with each new model.</li>
            <li> My Precision 5000 is my new best friend.  </li>
            <li> Heads are easy to switch and keeping a &#x27;good&#x27; brush head</li>
            <li> Works really good but still prefer the Sonic a bit better (more because of the brushes)</li>
            <li> It is easy to tell when you have done a good job brushing as well as you get a star rating when you turn the toothbrush</li>
            <li> The product came quickly and worked great.  </li>
            <li> The brush is easy to use, has superior cleaning power</li>
            <li> The monitor is very easy to read and follow.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s very easy to use.</li>
            <li> 6 months.&lt;br /&gt;Overall good product if you are fine with spending almost 100 dollar on a tooth brush.</li>
            <li> i love how it tells you how well you clean your teeth and it works great.</li>
            <li> in all, I&#x27;m very impressed that Oral-B has continued the tradition of quality and performance that I had grown used to over the years with their older power toothbrush, and I am also pleased that they&#x27;ve improved on the performance of the power cells.</li>
            <li> in all, I&#x27;m very impressed that Oral-B has continued the tradition of quality and performance that I had grown used to over the years with their older power toothbrush, and I am also pleased that they&#x27;ve improved on the performance of the power cells.</li>
            <li> My first use was at night before bed and it cleaned me teeth amazingly, but the best part was that when I awoke in the morning, my teeth still felt really clean.  </li>
            <li> The way the brushhead moves is more effective, and I can see this is true.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Otherwise this is by far the best toothbrush I have owned</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s even fun to use and makes my teeth and gums feel great.</li>
            <li> I feel it does a great job cleaning and always leaves my mouth feeling fresh afterwards.  </li>
            <li> good price for  four differant settings enjoy</li>
            <li> The timer is also a nice reminder so I don&#x27;t spend more time on one area of teeth and neglect another area.</li>
            <li> but this is by far the best I have ever tried.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m so far impressed.</li>
            <li> Great product - Bit pricey but worth...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this product for about 2 months now and so far it&#x27;s worked great!  </li>
            <li> Still learning, but very happy with the results so far.  </li>
            <li> Wife said I wasn&#x27;t touching hers, so I purchased my own.  </li>
            <li> It just feels more effective.  </li>
            <li> I got this model to replace the Oral-B/Braun \\&quot;Triumph Professional Care\\&quot; (now discontinued version) toothbrush that I&#x27;ve been using for about 6 years now and that I&#x27;ve been very happy with.</li>
            <li> My dental hygienist is very, very happy with the way the Oral-B Professional 5000 is working for</li>
            <li> I liked it so much better than a tooth brush.</li>
            <li> The floss action isn&#x27;t as impressive as it sounds.  </li>
            <li> This is the best electric toothbrush i have had so far.</li>
            <li> The unit gives good performance and Amazon gave us the chance to purchase at a very economical price.</li>
            <li> It has a smoother and more pleasant sound as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Overall, a really good tooth brush and the battery life is very good.</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush--it is effective and cleans much better than any others I have used.</li>
            <li> Works great and happy with the case for travel especially.</li>
            <li> This be good :) THANKS guys!!!</li>
            <li> This is my first electric toothbrush and I am so happy I made the purchase.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s twice as effective at cleaning than a manual toothbrush, and slightly more effective than Sonic Care (which I enjoy using.)</li>
            <li> Leaves teeth feeling super!!</li>
            <li> This is a very advanced way of brushing your teeth.  </li>
            <li> Very comfortable to hold in the hand.</li>
            <li> But I am loving this new model works great and the 5 options of speed is a plus.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, powerful, efficient, and cost-effective as well!!!</li>
            <li> He loved it so much he thought I paid much more for it!</li>
            <li> This Oral -B toothbrush was recommended to me and it certainly does a great job.</li>
            <li> Certainly i recommend this product for everyone, it do a great job in cleaning and whiting your teeth ,</li>
            <li> Very good brushing action.</li>
            <li> and we both agree that mine is better.</li>
            <li> My favorite part, if you brush for 2:30 the smiley face winks at you.</li>
            <li> They said it&#x27;s because I have more energy when I start and am more aggressive.  </li>
            <li> even the most stubborn</li>
            <li> We absolutely love it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love it.  </li>
            <li> Overall, an excellent product.  </li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> It vibrates every 30 seconds to let you know you can do another part of your mouth (i.e., top row/front side, top row/back side, etc.).</li>
            <li> I did a lot of research before purchasing this, so I am fairly confident that it will work well</li>
            <li> I always go over the two minutes and brush more like four.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I always go over the two minutes and brush more like four.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love the sequence timer.  </li>
            <li> They explained this product could brush better than I could manually.</li>
            <li> After determining I was satisfied with this style brushhead I&#x27;ve ordered more.</li>
            <li> I recommend this brush, it&#x27;s a worthwhile investment.</li>
            <li> After so many uses and drying with a towel it began to peel off.</li>
            <li> /&gt;They also put a faster motor in the latest version.</li>
            <li> I read so many reviews before deciding which unit to purchase.</li>
            <li> Works better than described.</li>
            <li> Products are supposed to be better with the newer version</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush system.</li>
            <li> The battery eventually wears out and I ordered the latest model.</li>
            <li> But now after a month I can tell gums are feeling better and looking better.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> If that sounds appealing then get a Sonicare.  </li>
            <li> However, this latest generation has regressed.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love the toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> Glad I paid the additional for that.</li>
            <li> I love this tooth brush.</li>
            <li> In my opinion this model is fantastic!  </li>
            <li> The results are much better than manual brushing.  </li>
            <li> An excellent product that I would definitely purchase again and have recommended to everyone in our family.</li>
            <li> Much better quality than cheaper versions our friends tried out.</li>
            <li> And then, the charging takes more than 12 hours (closer to 24)</li>
            <li> The toothbrush is awesome, the only drawback is that as I travel all the time, I had to buy an additional 220-110V adapter.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had the unit about 3 months now and love it.  </li>
            <li> Love this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I love the clock/timer with its smiley face.</li>
            <li> I love everything about this toothbrush</li>
            <li> Overall, it works and I&#x27;m happy!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve enjoyed brushing more.  </li>
            <li> find that instead of using four quadrants I break it up into two (top and bottom)</li>
            <li> I find that that works better for</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m satisfied</li>
            <li> I love the preasure sensor.</li>
            <li> To summarize, I&#x27;m really glad I sprang for the 5,000 series.</li>
            <li> Love this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> This one takes more like 12 hours.</li>
            <li> I am enjoying the Precision 5000</li>
            <li> I really love it.</li>
            <li> I love that I can adjust the speed.</li>
            <li> Love the timer feature and the travel case.</li>
            <li> battery is excellent, it will hold a charge for several weeks, so the brush doesn&#x27;t need to be stored on the battery charger.  </li>
            <li> I got mine through my Dentist and love it.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Better feel, better balance.  </li>
            <li> My husband and I bought this set from our dentist and we love it.</li>
            <li> After using it a while I can say it was a worthwhile</li>
            <li> My dentist has told me for years that a power brush does a better job cleaning your teeth than a manual</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this Oral B.  </li>
            <li> I came across this one on Amazon, accidentally, and it sounded interesting.</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> LOVE this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so much more efficient than brushing your teeth manually.</li>
            <li> I drink coffee and tea and wanted a better way to keep my teeth from staining.</li>
            <li> Guess whose dentist was pleased with the upkeep between cleanings?  </li>
            <li> I love that the timer is connected to the toothbrush and that it comes with a travel case.  </li>
            <li> Have only had it for 2 recharges but have been very happy with it.</li>
            <li> i love that there is a time too.  </li>
            <li> Way better than the Phillips.  </li>
            <li> Love the circular rotation, it does make you feel like you have just come from dentist.</li>
            <li> and I love it...</li>
            <li> I just love my electric toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> We have used Oral-B electric toothbrushes for many years.</li>
            <li> I will know more when I get my teeth cleaned at the dentist.</li>
            <li> When spending $90+ for a toothbrush, I think there should be better customer service.</li>
            <li> Go with the top of the line 5000, its $50 more than the starter model but that is inexpensive vs the yearly +$100 for dental cleaning.</li>
            <li> This is a fabulous product!  </li>
            <li> I have handicapped hands love this</li>
            <li> I like the fact that the Oral-B handle is better sealed than the Sonicare</li>
            <li> the charger was ok</li>
            <li> This Oral-B product is superbly designed and is appropriate for a maximum of four users (if each uses only one toothbrush).  </li>
            <li> I always go beyond the two minute mark, but I am confident that I haven&#x27;t undercleaned.  </li>
            <li> I love this unit.  </li>
            <li> I was amazed at how much better it cleaned my teeth than the Sonicare</li>
            <li> use the &amp;#34;gentle&amp;#34; setting on the Oral-B, with a sensitive brush head, and my gums, along with my teeth, feel incredible.  </li>
            <li> I love all the features of this brush.</li>
            <li> More &amp;#34;Yugo&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;Geo Metro&amp;#34; than &amp;#34;Mercedes&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;2)</li>
            <li> If the wireless sensor was waterproof for the shower that would be even better.</li>
            <li> I have really enjoyed using this product.  </li>
            <li> Thanks oral-b for the great toothbrush with the included clock and heads.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  </li>
            <li> I purchased it not quite sure if I would like it more than Sonicare, but wiling to give it a chance.    </li>
            <li> As a bonus, brush head replacements are much more affordable than Sonicare replacement brush heads.    </li>
            <li> I love the brush head options.</li>
            <li> but I would expect more elaborate statistics and information from this output screen.</li>
            <li> However, it does feel as though there is significantly more movement on the tooth surface.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I went for the Precision 5000 because of the reviews on Amazon were mostly positive.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this product.</li>
            <li> and I love it....</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t imagine anything more I&#x27;d want out of a toothbrush.</li>
            <li> We love this product.</li>
            <li> Really does a great job at making my mouth feel cleaner.</li>
            <li> have recommended this device for more than three years and I am continually amazed at results my patients are getting.  </li>
            <li> But anyway it&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li> like it, love it.</li>
            <li> I would gladly recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> I use 2 modes at most.</li>
            <li> The display doesn&#x27;t tell you any more than is communicated by the brush handles&#x27; pauses and beeps.  </li>
            <li> So, my gums are better also.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this toothbrush for about two years now and have enjoyed it.</li>
            <li> a business perspective the company has created an ingenious model.</li>
            <li> You will not be able to replace it with ease or without a soldering kit.</li>
            <li> - More brushing programs / options&lt;br</li>
            <li> The brush itself feels more sturdy, and</li>
            <li> As a Oral-B Triumph 9900 user and a longtime Sonicare user prior to that, I was very impressed with the Oral-B Precision 5000.</li>
            <li> I like this brush just as well and love the travel case that comes with it.</li>
            <li> but I do like watching the included timer to make sure I am giving all portions of my mouth its 30 seconds per quadrant.</li>
            <li> Having never written a review before for any product, I am not at all intimidated because this is such a wonderful invention.</li>
            <li> I did some research and found that the Oral-B was the number one top rated teeth cleaning system over-all.</li>
            <li> I purchased one and my teeth have never felt better.</li>
            <li> A WINNER....... will buy again for sure...</li>
            <li> Money well invested :)</li>
            <li> I am so pleased with my choice.</li>
            <li> It better than the Soni care.</li>
            <li> and it was mostly a maze of pre-recorded messages (which made me wonder why those messages couldn&#x27;t play during the weekend).  </li>
            <li> The display timer also helps me make sure I&#x27;m thorough.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The 2 minute cycle is divided into four sections which I use to concentrate on each section of my teeth, making sure to hit all surfaces in the 30 seconds per section.  </li>
            <li> also love the improved tray to protect the brush heads.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t sure I needed, or wanted,</li>
            <li> So glad I bit the bullet and went for it.  </li>
            <li> I was hoping for more spin.</li>
            <li> The product is well made, charges fast, and works great.  </li>
            <li> I love how my mouth feels after I use it.  </li>
            <li> otherwise it is better than mannual brushing.</li>
            <li> We love this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> love the flossing feature especially,as well as the timing.</li>
            <li> I just love  everything about this toothbrush</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a worthwhile investment.</li>
            <li> I am so glad I got this.</li>
            <li> OK, again 1st the caveats.</li>
            <li> If you are used to most any electric toothbrush, you will love this puppy.</li>
            <li> This has worked so much better for us.  </li>
            <li> I really love it.  </li>
            <li> I really enjoyed it a lot.  </li>
            <li> My teeth had never look better and cleaner.</li>
            <li> However, this is overkill for most people who do not need a star system in order to brush their teeth.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The manual could use some more clarity.  </li>
            <li> - this is a toothbrush of the highest quality with the most features.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Oral-B electric toothbrushes for many years.</li>
            <li> but I really love all of the features.</li>
            <li> but it helps me brush better and longer.</li>
            <li> It takes more than 24 hours to recharge fully.  </li>
            <li> You&#x27;re not going to find an electric toothbrush better than Oral-B.</li>
            <li> Much better than the battery operated toothbrushed.</li>
            <li> (it&#x27;s lighter and pressure-warning red-light has much more convenient place now) and just one issue.</li>
            <li> I love the Oral-B Precision 5000.</li>
            <li> the management system functions are a bit over the top, but if one needed that level of guidance, I guess it better be there?&lt;br</li>
            <li> , I love it, I want some more of it&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt; Tim M.&lt;br</li>
            <li> , I love it, I want some more of it&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt; Tim M.</li>
            <li> This my favorite tool.</li>
            <li> Time will tell whether I love it or not.  </li>
            <li> I bought this toothbrush for my family , they are so pleased with it ..</li>
            <li> I also wish there was more info on children and electric toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> This is the 3rd (and best) Oral-B I&#x27;ve used over the years.  </li>
            <li> I love the ease of use and the multi brushing levels.  </li>
            <li> Finally the travel option is wonderful.</li>
            <li> Probably better for the battery though.</li>
            <li> I already got one of these through my dentist office and I love mine.</li>
            <li> They are more manageable in the mouth and are a lot easier on the gums.  </li>
            <li> It is so lovely having a printer do what it should do without coaxing.  </li>
            <li> 5 stars! :)</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> I love a toothbrush that does ALL the work for me.  </li>
            <li> I am totally satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gotta cost more too</li>
            <li> Love this model.  </li>
            <li> All the many features make it a thorough tooth cleaning device.  </li>
            <li> I love the pressure sensor.  </li>
            <li> Not something that many might ask for</li>
            <li> the extra timer is excellent to have as a clock in the bathroom when you are not brushing your teeth.</li>
            <li> Probably not.&lt;br /&gt;  Love the timer too.</li>
            <li> station&lt;br /&gt;everthing is ok.  </li>
            <li> All of them lasted many years.</li>
            <li> I love the product .My</li>
            <li> I did not switch over many years before.</li>
            <li> For me, the tray is not helpful, but it could be if more than one person uses the toothbrush so that everybody can fit their own head on it when they brush.</li>
            <li> So glad I bought the Oral B toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> Now, there is more of a noticeable stop after each 30 seconds (though it&#x27;s just a split</li>
            <li> I sure am glad I did.  </li>
            <li> Makes me want to go and brush my teeth. :)</li>
            <li> It seems I received a lemon in the original brush, as this replacement is awesome, even more than when I first bought the original brush.</li>
            <li> I Absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> So, I went to Best Buy and purchased the same version and did a comparison.</li>
            <li> However, this toothbrush does an excellent job way beyond the results I was gettilng with my regular toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> It exceeds my expectations, and I love it.</li>
            <li> I love the brush and the clock</li>
            <li> This latest, the 5000, replaces my Plaque Remover 3D.  </li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> It will provide you with a bonus star (5-stars in all) if you brush for an additional 30 seconds or more.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s better than advertised.</li>
            <li> and I love the timer.</li>
            <li> Many emails and phone calls resulted with me sending.</li>
            <li> It really does a great job cleaning your teeth.  </li>
            <li> I love the &amp;#34;fresh from the dentist&amp;#34; feel after using this.  </li>
            <li> :)  </li>
            <li> so I bet this toothbrush would encourage better children brushing as well.  </li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> This will save you money to buy more heads.</li>
            <li> Since it has been recommended by dentists it makes this purchase better.</li>
            <li> They love theirs too.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I love this tooth brush.</li>
            <li> but now i have a clock in my bathroom.  : )</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m really pleased.</li>
            <li> However, I am prepared to put up with a bit more noise if it does what it is supposed to do.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t matter how many times a day I flossed, it would continually build up.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these Oral B brushes for many years and have had better checkups with these than I had years ago using the Sonicare product.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I listened.  </li>
            <li> but I kept smiling just to see my teeth :)</li>
            <li> love the travel case.  </li>
            <li> would recommend this to anyone wanting better oral hygiene.</li>
            <li> I am enjoying this Oral B.</li>
            <li> guess Eastern engineering is now better than that found in Merkel</li>
            <li> This cleans much better</li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> This is a great buy and makes your teeth so clean and helps so much if you have gum disease!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve used this product for over 2 months and it still feels great and gives you plenty of power to give a clean and powerful brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So far I am ver impressed with the quality of clean that the product provides.  </li>
            <li> If it seems like I&#x27;m a bit over appreciative consider that when you go almost a month without being able to take a shower yet your teeth feel amazingly clean</li>
            <li> I used to own the older version of this toothbrush and loved it.</li>
            <li> Using your favorite toothpaste, The Oral-B will leave your mouth feeling very clean.  </li>
            <li> I really like the timer too!!!!</li>
            <li> The teeth never felt better, great product that I can highly recommend.  </li>
            <li> I find it gives me a nice clean feel and</li>
            <li> ,it works great and its highly quality toothbrush, i had the triumph before and it works 4 years</li>
            <li> Highly recommended, and the Amazon.com \\&quot;Frustration Free\\&quot; packaging on this unit is a welcome addition!compliment to the Oral-B design as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is a great product and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> My teeth fill very clean after use.</li>
            <li> The brush head makes my teeth feel very clean.</li>
            <li> For 6 months it worked well and my teeth felt very clean after brushing.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, it gets my teeth very clean.</li>
            <li> You get a very clean feel.</li>
            <li> My teeth feel very clean when I am done using it.  </li>
            <li> My teeth feel very clean after each use.</li>
            <li> Also, the toothbrush seems to stay very clean, provided you remove the brush and rinse it after each session.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall I think this is a pretty good toothbrush.</li>
            <li> #34;sparkle&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;The timer is an awesome way of telling how long you have been brushing.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush gives a good cleaning and is exactly as described.</li>
            <li> These brushes are great quality; they last forever, and do a nice job of keeping your teeth and gums healthy.</li>
            <li> Each lasted a long time and I was very happy with it.</li>
            <li> The clock/timer thing is really handy because I can guarantee you don&#x27;t brush for a full two minutes.</li>
            <li> I actually loved it from the first time that I used it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not disappointed!</li>
            <li> I had been looking for a very long time for the best rechargeable electric  toothbrush I could find.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Defineatly a worthwhile investment and a strong recommendation to buy.  </li>
            <li> and it still holds a good charge for several weeks and maintains good stroke power.&lt;br</li>
            <li> it comes with works very well and makes sure you do a good job cleaning.</li>
            <li> , so it&#x27;s very easy to clean.</li>
            <li> , battery lasts about a week on a single charge, and the best argument, no cavities and I was complimented by the hygienist.</li>
            <li> However, it is the single best toothbrush I have ever used.  </li>
            <li> Talk about squeaky clean teeth!  </li>
            <li> What can you say about Oral B except they clean the teeth of America!</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m sure they will be fine.</li>
            <li> My teeth feel just as clean as when I go to the dentist!</li>
            <li> Way easier to clean the holder now!</li>
            <li> My teeth haven&#x27;t felt so clean!</li>
            <li> It works so well, that the hygienist keeps asking how I keep my teeth so clean!  </li>
            <li> Great toothbrush, compatible with a wide series of brush heads, holds a charge well, comes with a good traveling case, easy to operate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The smart guide helps with brushing and the clock is good if you need to see the time.</li>
            <li> It gets my teeth very clean and is easy to move around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> very cool.  </li>
            <li> Overall, a very good buy.</li>
            <li> That is extremely useful because it is very easy to spend more time on one part of your mouth than another.</li>
            <li> This is a great toothbrush--timer makes me brush full two minutes and my mouth feels clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> and I feel more comfortable talking to people</li>
            <li> /&gt;There are many options of brush replacements available.  </li>
            <li> Now, I have his old one which I use for my jewelry cleaning and it works great</li>
            <li> The brush itself is great and nearly identical to what I had.  </li>
            <li> Great find on Amazon as far as the pricing as I saved over $45 on this unit from the price my dentist was quoting from his office.</li>
            <li> great upgrade from our old one.  </li>
            <li> I have used those cheap 10 dollar electric toothbrushes for many years.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush works great so far.</li>
            <li> My dentist suggested and had a great deal on an Oral B Professional Precision 5000.</li>
            <li> Along with flossing and mouthwash, the floss action heads work great.  </li>
            <li> far as the 5000 model goes, the brush itself and case holder are great.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m happy to report the Professional 5000 lives up to all of&lt;br /&gt;the claims made in the ads.  </li>
            <li> Great replacement for my old Oral B brush.  </li>
            <li> Great electric tooth brush I purchased to replace an old Oral B that lasted over 15 years.  </li>
            <li> I was going to review it soon after I bought it, but decided to wait because in my opinion, the real worth of a toothbrush of this nature is shown after using if for quite a while.  </li>
            <li> This is a fairly pricey toothbrush and I struggled with spending so much money for it.</li>
            <li> A push type reel mower will cut the grass but it really doesn&#x27;t do as good a job as a power mower.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The carry case is nice, but I don&#x27;t find the brush holder useful.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really that good.  </li>
            <li> Good teeth become much appreciated with the expanding years.  </li>
            <li> This is a great tool for your teeth, easy to use,  Love the rechargeable battery, way better than the regular batteries, I don&#x27;t use the timer/clock thought..</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use and my mouth feels really clean!</li>
            <li> This brush in particular does a very effective job and has very useful speeds.  </li>
            <li> This toothbrush has strong action and feels like it does a great job.</li>
            <li> Product seems great when cleaning, but the batteries die SUPER fast.</li>
            <li> My original review is wildly enthusiastic about a great product - however, over several months&#x27; use, I found the \\&quot;Floss</li>
            <li> Wow what a very nice improvement.</li>
            <li> The brush heads are unique, and seem more customized to teeth.</li>
            <li> brush heads are interchangeable with other Oral-B toothbrushes, which is awesome!</li>
            <li> After I compared it to other leading brands I found this one to be the best for what my dentist wanted and the price and value.  </li>
            <li> I used to roll my eyes when they said that in commercials, but now I see it&#x27;s true!</li>
            <li> perfect for getting the little ones to brush for two minutes, sometimes more.  </li>
            <li> One of our best purchases, providing excellant oral care .Considering additional puchases for other family members.</li>
            <li> I always brush the full time!  </li>
            <li> The power cord has a piece of Velcro attached to it for easy storage.  </li>
            <li> I like the Oral B Healthy Clean.  </li>
            <li> If it shows 2:05, that&#x27;s no guarantee that brushing technique was ideal, but it&#x27;s at least one reassurance that good habits are taking hold.</li>
            <li> Had the previous version and loved it and this does as good or better work.</li>
            <li> My teeth even remain more clean throughout the day between brushing; and even after about 2-3 days of use</li>
            <li> This one is easy to set up and use.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s compact, easy to use and</li>
            <li> The monitor can be stored on the shelf or mounted on the wall using a holder that supplied with the kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The travel case makes it easy to take this when I</li>
            <li> These items aside, it does a wonderful job of cleaning my teeth and they are much cleaner than they ever were with my old unit.  </li>
            <li> Now I realize that it cups each tooth to clean better.</li>
            <li> Does a much better job keeping teeth clean than manual brushing.</li>
            <li> It is better to get the head out from time to time, and clean up everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great at cleaning, easier to use than its predecessor, and more versatile than prior models.</li>
            <li> Whats not to love - makes your teeth feel dentist clean.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and</li>
            <li> /&gt;- discharges very quickly</li>
            <li> Easy to use and cleans well.</li>
            <li> My hygienist complimented me on my clean healthy teeth and gums since using this and water pic.  </li>
            <li> It is easy to use and the machine hints ensure a thorough cleaning.</li>
            <li> Easy to setup &amp; use.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use and operate.  </li>
            <li> So far, I really like this over my Sonic, plus my dentist says this is the best, so I got one.</li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is an easy to use toothbrush that helps me keep brushing for the correct amount of time.</li>
            <li> Also it is easy to take with me when traveling.</li>
            <li> My teeth feel even more clean than when I use a manual toothbrush.</li>
            <li> The storage case makes it easy to travel with as well.</li>
            <li> Easy to use</li>
            <li> Easy to use and</li>
            <li> love the way my teeth feels.. clean</li>
            <li> I find this easy to use.  </li>
            <li> i love how clean my teeth are.</li>
            <li> Have found I really dont need so many speed variations, but they are nice to have.</li>
            <li> The Duracell batteries that comes with the set is still going strong after almost a month.  </li>
            <li> Strong recommendation.</li>
            <li> Comfortable to use, and you can tell its worth the money with how effective it</li>
            <li> Well, with this product at least.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like the features that help you brush more effectively.</li>
            <li> Its still going strong.</li>
            <li> The guide book has easy to read text and good diagrams that make it easy to assemble, use and clean the toothbrush and smart guide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re new to rechargeable toothbrushes, the vibrations take some getting used to, but you get one heck of a clean!!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Granted, I don&#x27;t have much to compare it to besides the old-fashioned, archaic, manual toothbrush, but I&#x27;m very satisfied</li>
            <li> It cleans my teeth nicely and is very convenient!</li>
            <li> I also own a Sonicare toothbrush that I bought when my first Braun died</li>
            <li> So this is hands down the best toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
            <li> This new one is even better than the first one does a great job.</li>
            <li> And now when my bracket for the smart guide broke and I called to try to purchase another one, they said they do not sell them?!!?!</li>
            <li> It performs excellently and the remote indicator is so cool</li>
            <li> This is my second electric toothbrush and I must say I&#x27;m pretty impressed.</li>
            <li> , it worked perfectly for 110 or 120&amp;#62; I thought I was choosing the same exactly model</li>
            <li> and Im pretty sure the my dental bill will be happier :)</li>
            <li> Meets my expectations and does a fine job of cleaning my teeth.</li>
            <li> And it quickly failed.&lt;br /&gt;You would think P &amp; G would do a better job.</li>
            <li> These stay accessible, clean, and I keep better track of my supply.</li>
            <li> /clock on it was a bit much when I first opened the package, but I can now honestly say it comes in handy while brushing.  </li>
            <li> The Oral B system uses brush heads that easily slip on and off the brush and the system includes a tray for each brush head - making it easy to remove, clean and store between brushes.</li>
            <li> Finally, the unit is well weighted, ergonomically functional, and has a more pleasant noise than the Sonicare.</li>
            <li> too strong for my sensitive teeth but a good product.</li>
            <li> This one is easy to handle, has the 4 beeps to indicate when you&#x27;ve finished brushing each quadrant of your mouth, brushing is (so far) effective (certainly more so than a manual brush) and has a traveling case.  </li>
            <li> &quot; I think the Smart Guide is a handy reminder to assist you in spending the correct amount of time on each quadrant of your mouth.</li>
            <li> If you do it for two minutes you will see a little happy face!</li>
            <li> VERY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!</li>
            <li> wished it came with 2 brushes to give one to my husband or I could order a replacement to use same charger and smart guide but this does not affect the awesome toothbrush at all</li>
            <li> /&gt;Customer service was very quick to resolve the original rebate issue I posted.</li>
            <li> I had previously owned a cheaper Sonic brush, and my dentist strongly recommended that I buy Oral-B since the technology is simply better and more effective - and I agree!  </li>
            <li> toothbrush cleans very good, that is why I give 1 star, but it will destroy your gums and bone.&lt;br /&gt;I will recomend much more the Sonicare toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> It is hard to imagine a better toothbrush, and the Amazon price is awesome.  </li>
            <li> The battery display on the toothbrush is always extremely accurate and lets me know</li>
            <li> Having the indicator, which seems fairly accurate, is nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> .. enjoy your product but do not expect to get a mail-in-rebate money....  </li>
            <li> So I am overall happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> Also, it is nice to have a clock in the bathroom and it doesn&#x27;t take up much space.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more powerful than I planned.</li>
            <li> This thing does it all and the digital timer greatly helps</li>
            <li> Virtually no cleaning to do and the heads snap on smooth as silk.  </li>
            <li> I actually enjoy and look forward to using this product every day.  </li>
            <li> Absolutely fantastic.</li>
            <li> only downside would be the batteries - They aren&#x27;t great - maybe get 6-8 days of battery life (using 2x a day).  </li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t really do much except tell the time, honestly.</li>
            <li> I finally had to replace my old Oral-B after MANY years of excellent cleaning.</li>
            <li> Fantastic.  </li>
            <li> Sure, it&#x27;s pricey, but heck, I&#x27;m worth it...</li>
            <li> /&gt;Very easy to clean handle, stand, recharger and brush tray.</li>
            <li> and I think I will have great results at my next dental check-up.  </li>
            <li> Overall, it does a great job cleaning your teeth.  </li>
            <li> It easily rinses clean when I am done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> ( the indicator light gone off)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also engaging.</li>
            <li> This is a fabulous toothbrushing system.  </li>
            <li> Made a great Christmas present.</li>
            <li> yes, but worth every penny and more.  </li>
            <li> The extra features are great as well.  </li>
            <li> cheap looking travel case.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The brush is great, I&#x27;d definitely recommend it....</li>
            <li> The motor makes a sort of grinding sound</li>
            <li> It works great and is so simple to use.  </li>
            <li> And Amazon had it delivered to my door in a few days which worked out great!!!</li>
            <li> So, still a great brush but keep the relatively short lifetime in mind as you consider the price.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Nothing but great things to say about this product, and you especially can&#x27;t beat Amazon&#x27;s prices and service.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;Electric brush maintenance and cleaning is important.</li>
            <li> It said service was available Mon-Fri from like 9A-6P.  </li>
            <li> Went to the Dentist last week and had a great check up.</li>
            <li> Shaves close, leaves skin feeling smooth with no cuts or nicks..</li>
            <li> short, I like both the Sonicare and the Oral B as each have their own advantages and disadvantages but both are excellent toothbrushes and a big upgrade from manual..  </li>
            <li> short, I like both the Sonicare and the Oral B as each have their own advantages and disadvantages but both are excellent toothbrushes and a big upgrade from manual.</li>
            <li> In this kit you get one free brush head(it&#x27;s the flossing one)</li>
            <li> This spin brush is great, solidly built with additional features.</li>
            <li> this point I think the 5000 is well worth the price and am glad I bought it.</li>
            <li> My opinion will be more useful after I print off a couple of reams of paper.  </li>
            <li> I like the five brushing modes that are available</li>
            <li> All the modes feel comfortable to use.  </li>
            <li> a quarter of the circle around the smiling face is filled in letting the user know</li>
            <li> One of the stars on the smartguide is then filled</li>
            <li> We purchased it for our own use and find it very satisfactory</li>
            <li> I am able to just stand in the shower and wake up while my mouth becomes minty fresh.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a different technology, but I am happy with it.  </li>
            <li> that&#x27;s smooth like just being to the dentist for a polishing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After a couple weeks of using this toothbrush, I really enjoy it.</li>
            <li> Packaging is indeed frustration free.</li>
            <li> They are gifts for my parents, and they enjoy using this &amp;#34;professional&amp;#34; tooth brush.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> very usable and love the brush, really cleans by 73 year old teeth and keeps them in great shape!</li>
            <li> It does sound like a caterpillar tractor is excavating when brushing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as comfortable to use as the Sonicare was.</li>
            <li> If I had kids, especially with braces etc, what a great tooth brush.  </li>
            <li> and I experienced the same problem with both.  </li>
            <li> It is just fantastic the family loves it two&lt;br /&gt;Lyn</li>
            <li> I loved the soft bristles on there</li>
            <li> However, the timer was kind of unecessary, although pretty cool.</li>
            <li> It does a good job of brushing along with floss action.</li>
            <li> The best brush I have ever used, it has a timer and it make you aware of how long you are spending on cleaning your teeth correctly,</li>
            <li> , This will get you more ladies when they see your good smelling breath and white teeth.</li>
            <li> so far so good.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush itself makes sure you&#x27;re brushing at the appropriate proximity to your teeth without applying too much pressure.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is really good with multiple settings and we love the timer.</li>
            <li> so far so good.</li>
            <li> One thing that surprised me was that it felt good on my gums.</li>
            <li> Ever since the purchase of the Oral-B Professional Health + Floss Action Precision 5000, my check-ups at the dentist have been excellent.</li>
            <li> She feels that the rotary motion is far superior to the sonic waves.  </li>
            <li> I was looking for a Sonic Care, then a WaterPik, and finally I found this to be the best all-around electric toothbrush and decided to make the purchase.</li>
            <li> I have owned several Electric Tooth Brushes but this was the absolute best.</li>
            <li> Its a good toothbrush very powerful than my old OralB. worked well</li>
            <li> Very nice complex with timer (and time) and good brush.</li>
            <li> My husband and I both use this new toothbrush and are very satisfied with it.</li>
            <li> And it helps make sure he brushes the right way.</li>
            <li> However, it&#x27;s a significant improvement on the old model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s easy to see right out of the box and after the first charge that it has much more power, which is a welcome change.</li>
            <li> Sense\\&quot; without these features I&#x27;d be brushing my teeth incorrectly with a very powerful</li>
            <li> so basically in a few more months, wont charge at all!!!</li>
            <li> The diagram on the timer really does make me aware of each quadrant of my mouth, so I brush more effectively than I used to.</li>
            <li> other point that I would like to make here is that this particular toothbrush is considered the very best by our dentist and probably as well as most dentists out there.  </li>
            <li> other point that I would like to make here is that this particular toothbrush is considered the very best by our dentist and probably as well as most dentists out there.  </li>
            <li> Teeth feel clean and smooth like a dental cleaning.  </li>
            <li> I now have an electric toothbrush that has my teeth feeling clean all the time, and an apparatus that is easy to clean and therefore always clean now.</li>
            <li> teeth feel so clean and smooth .&lt;br</li>
            <li> TEETH FEEL SMOOTH AND CLEAN WHEN CYCLE COMPLETED.</li>
            <li> People of all ages have begun using this rechargeable tooth brush and there is a measurable improvement in the color and texture of the gum, a reduction in bleeding and inflammation, beautiful smile results, and almost universal enjoyment of using the brush.  </li>
            <li> powerful, teeth feel really clean on all surfaces and in between!</li>
            <li> It was worth the money because now my teeth feel dentist clean all the time!</li>
            <li> I am sure my Dentist will  be pleased with my new tooth Care.</li>
            <li> It quickly and easily helps remove plaque and tartar and gives your teeth a clean shine.  </li>
            <li> I chose this model because of the rating,and was not disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Unique how this thing times you as you brush your teeth</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s well built and user friendly.  </li>
            <li> I normally brush for over thirty seconds in each section (and I have my own way of brushing) and I don&#x27;t like the way the brush pauses to indicate that its time to move on.  </li>
            <li> I received this toothbrush thru the Amazon Vine program, and reviewed it on the original product page.</li>
            <li> You are worth it!</li>
            <li> reasons why this product got 4 and not 5 stars are listed below in my original review.&lt;br /&gt;------------------------------------------------------------&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have purchased three of these, one for me and two others as gifts, and as far as I know, the recipients have been very satisfied with the gifts.</li>
            <li> when does not come in the original box.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> - The whole system is a much better set-up, easier clean-up and more fun.</li>
            <li> It does seem to get my teeth significantly cleaner than manual brushing.</li>
            <li> This one works even better than the first.</li>
            <li> Makes it almost fun!</li>
            <li> I know they require my original receipt (which I can&#x27;t find) in order to do \\&quot;in warranty service\\&quot;</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is worth every cent!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s worth the money!</li>
            <li> Love it exact model I was looking for.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never needed anything more than the first mode</li>
            <li> Well worth the money!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m replacing one of the original 2 speed brushes.</li>
            <li> Original brush does not work for teeth.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have been using and enjoying an Oral-B Triumph toothbrush for several years; which worked flawlessly until recently.  </li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t wait to brush again to change it to a smile!  </li>
            <li> This product is worth writing about!  </li>
            <li> Worth the price!</li>
            <li> Who knew I&#x27;d be so excited about a toothbrush?  </li>
            <li> I would have given it a higher rating if I was able to clean my tongue thoroughly.</li>
            <li> My teeth feel so clean when I am finished brushing.</li>
            <li> My teeth are whiter and feel as clean as when I go to the dentist.  </li>
            <li> I did some research and chose this one based on Amazon reviews, and now that I&#x27;m using it, my teeth seem as clean as they do after my bi-annual cleaning and polishing.</li>
            <li> Your teethe feel really clean all the way to the gum.</li>
            <li> Every time I used it, I felt my teeth were extremely clean.  </li>
            <li> B002HWS9FW Oral-B Pro-Health Precision Clean Battery Toothbrush, 1 Count]]    </li>
            <li> My teeth have never felt so clean.  </li>
            <li> My teeth have never felt so clean.</li>
            <li> My dentist was always saying how clean my teeth were when I&#x27;d go for my oral check-ups.</li>
            <li> rather it be able to stand up on its own on the back of my sink</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this brush for the better part of a month and for the most part, it&#x27;s identical to the [[ASIN:B004O76DEC Oral-B Professional Care SmartSeries 5000]</li>
            <li> Call me simple, but I love having the 30-second reminders to switch zones when I am brushing and the smiley face when you hit two minutes is a nice way to start the day.</li>
            <li> an this prevents that and gets my teeth totally clean.  </li>
            <li> i just don&#x27;t feel like my teeth are clean unless i have an electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> my teeth feel clean.</li>
            <li> Awesome toothbrush, love that they sell extra soft bristles for those of us with sensitive gums :)</li>
            <li> I also like the included travel case and container to keep the brush heads in as it keeps them clean throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought this toothbrush because my dentist said I needed to get a &amp;#34;deeper&amp;#34; clean on my teeth and gums.  </li>
            <li> office clean.  </li>
            <li> To date I have only tried the floss action head which I like, but I having the option to use any brush head great!</li>
            <li> Your teeth will still feel clean even after you&#x27;ve eaten.</li>
            <li> The timer is an important addition, helps tremendously with uniformity of brushing.  </li>
            <li> Oral hygienist told me she wishes every patient had a clean mouth like mine and I attribute that to this tooth brush.</li>
            <li> It took hours of frustration to get the unit almost sorta clean.</li>
            <li> My teeth never felt totally clean.</li>
            <li> and I can tell when he misses places as the areas that are clean &amp;</li>
            <li> note, 20+ yr user of the Precision Clean brush head.</li>
            <li> My teeth feel really clean.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush gets my teeth quite clean.  </li>
            <li> The 30 sec timer per quadrant makes sure you get good coverage for all teeth.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The Oral-B works to keep my teeth clean.  </li>
            <li> It gets my teeth extremely clean.  </li>
            <li> This is a great product and IMO worth the extra money.</li>
            <li> Makes your teeth feel so clean.</li>
            <li> It makes my teeth feel so so clean.</li>
            <li> (Also, the Sonicare seemed to fling more dental detritus onto the bathroom mirror which was kind of gross.)</li>
            <li> He has never seen my teeth so clean.  </li>
            <li> My teeth feel clean and after 5 days of use</li>
            <li> Now you just need to clean the base.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I always felt that my teeth just doesn&#x27;t get the feeling of being clean.</li>
            <li> It vibrates a lot more than my old one, and I can tell it is cleaning my teeth better.  </li>
            <li> and the hygienist commented on how clean my teeth were.  </li>
            <li> It gives me a feeling of clean that a manual toothbrush just doesn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> My teeth feel so clean</li>
            <li> To my pleasant surprise, he uses this same one based on his research.</li>
            <li> Would be great for a single person.</li>
            <li> I have been very pleased with the cleaning action of the head on the Oral-B design for 6 years now, and since this one works just the same way, though with a bit more power, I&#x27;m confident I&#x27;ll be as happy with this one as with the last.</li>
            <li> I feel like it is much better at cleaning my teeth and the separate timer is better at motivating me to complete the full two minutes of brushing.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really need a smiley face that lights up when I complete a quadrant of my mouth, but I think that a children&#x27;s version of this would be great; it would keep kids motivated to brush for a full two minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have owned it for two months thus far and love it!</li>
            <li> It seems pretty strong and decent coverage, but not as nice as the cordura semi-rigid cases they used to give you.</li>
            <li> It has some really great features to ensure that you brush properly and for the right amount of time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to get excited about a toothbrush, this is hands-down the best toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a pretty minor issue, but I liked having more grades of battery life and being able to see the charge level without turning the toothbrush on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The original Oral-B electric toothbrush I used, while effective, had to be replaced when it stopped recharging completely.  </li>
            <li> We also notice our teeth are getting whiter without any special treatment or whitening toothpaste.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Even if your dentist does not sell the kit, I recommend this toothbrush for folks who need flexibility and/or have special needs.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure they were the 1,000 series, but I can&#x27;t be certain.</li>
            <li> love the smart guide.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if Oral-b had it made special or if it is a off-the-shelf product for Braun.  </li>
            <li> Got this on a special sale.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been able to get the smart guide screen to come on, but I don&#x27;t feel that is a problem.  </li>
            <li> I feel as though I made the right choice!  </li>
            <li> I feel like I am out of the dentist&#x27;s chair every morning after brushing my teeth with the Oral-B Professional Healthy Clean (precision clean head)!</li>
            <li> They make a HUGE difference in the appearance of your smile and how clean your teeth stay between visits to the Dentist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> you absolutely MUST make sure that the motor is clean after each use.</li>
            <li> , I still have all my own teeth, a decent smile, etc.</li>
            <li> This product really get you teeth clean and gets your gums into tip top shape.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Other than that, I would recommend this brush to anyone who wants to attain a clean, healthy mouth.</li>
            <li> I just received my Oral B 5000, was excited to receive it so quick.</li>
            <li> This replaced a very high end Sonicare, and I really am pleased with the change.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;please full charge before use</li>
            <li> You get 20 brushes per full charge (10 days - 2x per day).  </li>
            <li> You get 20 brushes per full charge (10 days - 2x per day).  </li>
            <li> but this one is far more powerful and the options offer much more</li>
            <li> and then  I recharged it in full, then removed from charger.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is kind of loud.</li>
            <li> Used these for years, but battery will only hold a good charge for about 2 years.  </li>
            <li> It really does an outstanding job of cleaning your teeth.  </li>
            <li> When this happens, there is no way to tell whether the toothbrush is charging and when it has a full charge.    </li>
            <li> my teeth were noticeably whiter now than they&#x27;ve ever been, and having used it regularly for a month or so now they look almost as good as when I leave the doctors chair.</li>
            <li> I bought this after wanting to upgrade from my old electric toothbrush and my fiance has since stolen it and is using it as his own.</li>
            <li> It makes me feel that I have to give the teeth a full brushing, even when I am in a hurry to get to bed at night</li>
            <li> (it keeps me from cheating my teeth out of a full brushing).  </li>
            <li> Overall a good product.  </li>
            <li> , I brush my teeth for the full 2 minutes instead of just 1 minute.  </li>
            <li> I feel my teeth are super clean</li>
            <li> The visual guides on the monitor are good teaching aids.</li>
            <li> It has a good power motor and cleans your teeth well enough.</li>
            <li> Love the timer lets you know if you are applying to much pressure.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d venture to say that I seldom (if ever) used to brush my teeth for a full 2 minutes before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A full charge for me lasts about 4-5 days.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Still loving brush action.</li>
            <li> It has replaceable heads and because of this my husband and I share it, which really makes it even better.</li>
            <li> B003UKM9CO Precision 1000]] already has four 30-seconds reminders to switch between different parts of your mouth (remember 2 minutes is the optimum time to brush),</li>
            <li> It does such a good cleaning that flossing is a breeze.</li>
            <li> (That is cool.</li>
            <li> Do take note that this toothbrush requires a full 24 hour charge before using, and I have found that even with just me using it twice a day for 2-3 minutes each time, it requires a full recharge every 5 - 6 days.</li>
            <li> Thanks to Amazon Vine, I have since upgraded to the 5000 thousand model, and I love it.</li>
            <li> I will recommend this product to anyone who wants to have healthy teeth.</li>
            <li> and I finally got it at Amazon for a really good price.</li>
            <li> Love the toothbrush, very efficient brushing, pauses when it&#x27;s time to change quadrants.</li>
            <li> Overall, a good toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I love using it and feel my teeth and gums are  much cleaner.  </li>
            <li> With this product you will definitely get what you pay for because it is ultra superior to manual brushing.</li>
            <li> I get maybe 3 to 4 full</li>
            <li> helps me keep brushing a full two minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> However I&#x27;ve found that the addition of the spinning brush really puts the Oral-b over the top for me.  </li>
            <li> : it does feel like the brush really works on a more isolated area of the teeth thoroughly&lt;</li>
            <li> A two year warranty (good) and a 60 day money back guarantee are included.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you go the full two minutes, all four stars will darken (and the smiley face on the display smiles).  </li>
            <li> With two uses a day on a full charge, it can go about 4 days without being charged again.</li>
            <li> My teeth feels super clean and refreshed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ever used and superior to Sonicare) but having a charger that is only 110-130v and</li>
            <li> My dentist has had nothing but good things to say about my teeth and gums since I started using my Oral-B Triumph several years ago.  </li>
            <li> but the dental hygienist didn&#x27;t comment on how nice my teeth were until I came in after using the Oral-B Professional 5000 for six months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After losing the Phillips Sonicare Diamond</li>
            <li> Once you have set the clock up, bluetooth takes care of the rest, which is a cool feature.</li>
            <li> My mouth feels super clean.  </li>
            <li> - I wish there were more information on ordering and using more of the different heads available.</li>
            <li> Good product, my last one lasted 10 yrs.</li>
            <li> for a full charge.</li>
            <li> Uses the same heads, which is good because I had a supply of them.  </li>
            <li> It is really loud, and it kind of feels like you have a weed whacker in your mouth.</li>
            <li> There were no bad</li>
            <li> It took a full 24 hours to fully charge up initially, but the battery lasts for a good week of brushing on just one</li>
            <li> My new brush has great cleaning action.  </li>
            <li> I find that it takes around 24 hours for a full charge, and it discharges rather quickly.</li>
            <li> and my whole mouth really just feels better!  </li>
            <li> This is a pretty good electric toothbrush, bought it due to other reviews by I wasn&#x27;t that impressed.</li>
            <li> Other than that the product is great ..</li>
            <li> Happy with purchase and timer is extremely helpful, even has a pressure meter.</li>
            <li> I love this new brush!</li>
            <li> I was offered the ability to test and review this new Oral-B Healthy Clean + Floss Precision 5000 toothbrush, which I gratefully accepted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My teeth feel so fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> They make your&lt;br /&gt;mouth feel fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> The Oral-B feels more like a dentist cleaning and love the different settings incorporated into it.</li>
            <li> Adequate</li>
            <li> But then I started thinking about how often I paid twenty dollars or more for the cheaper versions at the drug stores and how they were mediocre at best.</li>
            <li> I personally find Oral B just cleans better, has more brush head options &amp; the rechargeable battery life seems longer.</li>
            <li> I had 4 cavities and mild gingivitis.</li>
            <li> big, wonderful design change is the holder for the individual brushes.</li>
            <li> My teeth are super smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is it, and I don&#x27;t have to put up with a quickly worn out brushhead.</li>
            <li> The timer is cute, not necessary, but cute.  </li>
            <li> I hadn&#x27;t purchased such a top of the line electric toothbrush before and didn&#x27;t realize how much better they are compared to the cheapie drugstore models.  </li>
            <li> The brush arrived to my apartment quickly and setup was super easy.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Lucky for him</li>
            <li> It does such an awesome job at the very next dental checkup after using this model for about 6 weeks, the hygeniest commented on what a difference she saw in my teeth.  </li>
            <li> Otherwise take a good look at the nearly identical Oral-b 4000 which, depending on the vagaries of Amazon pricing, can be much cheaper (when I bought mine</li>
            <li> I love the different settings I am able to choose from and the timer helps me with brushing to the max time.  </li>
            <li> Really quick review:&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li> This scrubbing action does a great job of removing plaque, preventing stains, and the Floss Action heads do well at getting between teeth and removing food particles.  </li>
            <li> Therefore, although the unit has different modes, you can&#x27;t use more than one unless you buy more than one brush head type.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Therefore, although the unit has different modes, you can&#x27;t use more than one unless you buy more than one brush head type.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> would recommend this toothbrush to anyone who cares about their teeth and gums and doesn&#x27;t mind the tingly vibrations (which I promise you get used to quickly).</li>
            <li> THANKFULLY AMAZON HAS SUPER customer service</li>
            <li> I live the timer that helps me be sure to brush for the right amount of time!</li>
            <li> Oral B toothbrushes are much more affordable than Sonicare high end toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> I just love it and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> P &amp; G was once one of the great iconic American brands and now this malfunctioning model has replaced older much better models.&lt;br /&gt;Buy a different brand.</li>
            <li> If you do it right your teeth feel amazingly clean.</li>
            <li> The bathroom is exactly where I need the clock to be accurate: the clock in the wireless display should be an atomic (automatic setting) variety.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I was hesitant to spend $110 on a toothbrush but the first time I used it I could tell a huge difference.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for several months already and I am very pleased.</li>
            <li> Teeth feel smooth as glass after the first use.</li>
            <li> The Oral B Professional solves this problem very well and in my opinion better than most of the Sonicare brushes.</li>
            <li> It is marginally useful at best and not necessary for properly using the brush.</li>
            <li> After the very first use, my Mom said &amp;</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is totally worth the price, compatible with the whole Oral B selection of brushes, and is overall a great product.</li>
            <li> My wife and myself use this daily and are very pleased with its performance.  </li>
            <li> Still adjusting to the intense cleaning action but overall very pleased with the function - I&#x27;ve owned several Oral-B toothbrushes but this is the best model I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> This is by far the most powerful and advanced wireless toothbrush I have owned.  </li>
            <li> Good as far as I can tell however will know more after next dental check.</li>
            <li> so I expect good quality and long life again.</li>
            <li> i think this will help keep my oral hygiene and health, good in the long term.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I rarely pay full price for anything they sell.</li>
            <li> the accesory is good to see how long are you using the toothbrush.</li>
            <li> The timer is a good way guide you on how long to brush.</li>
            <li> toothbrush and smart guide are easy to assemble.</li>
            <li> Bought this toothbrush to replace my previous Oral-B Professional one that the battery died on and find it to be even better at providing a great brushing experience and leaving my mouth feeling super clean.</li>
            <li> I would definately recommend this tothbrush to anyone who wants smooth feeling teeth and a clean mouth.</li>
            <li> My teeth and gums feel healthy clean as if I just came from my dentist&#x27;s office after a professional cleaning.  </li>
            <li> Oral-B Professional Healthy Clean +</li>
            <li> This Oral-B Professional Healthy Clean Precision 5000 Electric Toothbrush is an updated version of the Oral-B SmartSeries 5000 Toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> It not only does a great cleaning but the easy use of the other features of this unit make it an over all grand slam in my opinion.</li>
            <li> More importantly, these days we already have too many wireless devices that start interfering with each other.  </li>
            <li> All in all a good product I believe--as long as you use it!</li>
            <li> Love the new one!!!r</li>
            <li> My new Sonicare is compact with a well-balanced handle and a better frequency.</li>
            <li> &amp; I love the new toothbrush storage.  </li>
            <li> love my new brush</li>
            <li> I almost purchased the new top of the line Sonicare but after doing some comparison shopping I decided on the Oral B 5000.  </li>
            <li> new iteration of the Oral B/Braun toothbrush includes the Smart Guide, which is supposed to guide you in terms of the amount of time, kind of brushing, etc.</li>
            <li> Teeth feel great and it&#x27;s wayyyyy less effort.</li>
            <li> my teeth are cleaner , gums are much tighter and this unit is easy to use .</li>
            <li> By encouraging their 2 minute routine, the SmartGuide really helped turn things around very quickly.  </li>
            <li> Most importantly your teeth will fill extra clean.</li>
            <li> The case allows me to easily travel with it, which is often, and its very well protected.</li>
            <li> I really like how easy it is to get the brush heads on and off with the Oral B.</li>
            <li> I am really enjoying using the Oral-B Professional Healthy Clean + Floss action Precision 5000 electric toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> awsome brush with timer to keep me honest and maximize my smiles full potential cant wait to show off the smile</li>
            <li> It really makes your teeth feel cleaner!!  </li>
            <li> We would highly recommend this product!!!</li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;m really glad I did!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t explored the other settings than the original but, overall, I&#x27;m very impressed with it.</li>
            <li> It would be nice to be able to buy the device without the display for less.</li>
            <li> To me, the previous generation,  the Triumph model (Triumph Professional Care 9000) is the best of the lot</li>
            <li> The brush head also seems to be strong and sturdy that I think this will last me more than 3 months.</li>
            <li> This thing is hands down better than the old models, which I was happy with.</li>
            <li> In my last dentist visit, they say all looks really good, a positive sign.</li>
            <li> First off, my teeth feel soooo clean all the time now...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not quite dentist&#x27;s office clean but pretty close.  </li>
            <li> It works extremely well, looks great in my bathroom, and is pretty portable.  </li>
            <li> lol I can make a little stand for it out of Sugru or Polymer clay</li>
            <li> The little clock that comes with it is a great help to let you know when to move to another part of your mouth</li>
            <li> I am sure all these modes are fine, but 98 percent of the time I use \\&quot;Daily Clean.\\</li>
            <li> There is a rather large LED light on the back of the powered brush handle as well, which flashes brightly if you are applying too much pressure when brushing.  </li>
            <li> While brushing your teeth is by no means rocket science, this toothbrush has tons of fantastic features and it would be very helpful if someone told you how to do it.  </li>
            <li> While brushing your teeth is by no means rocket science, this toothbrush has tons of fantastic features and it would be very helpful if someone told you how to do it.  </li>
            <li> cause every time I travel, I have to bring the charger with (kinda defeats the purpose of a mobile toothbrush), and honestly, if it sits off the charger for more than an hour, then it&#x27;s just dead.</li>
            <li> I am sure if you are 10 years old you will be able to see it clearly, but your grandparents might not find it easy to read if you give it as a gift to older people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I thought my last Oral B electric toothbrush was amazing.</li>
            <li> The travel case is very convenient and holds the items securely.  </li>
            <li> Looking forward to a great check up in a few months.</li>
            <li> I really like the light on the handle,</li>
            <li> Have used oral&#x3D;B for a few years, get great check ups at the dentist since I started using oral-b.  </li>
            <li> Amazing German engineering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it is worth it</li>
            <li> I only bought this one for my husband because he loved my toothbrush so much.</li>
            <li> So back it goes to Amazon (no charge for return shipping, thank you, Amazon), to be replaced by what I hope will be a brush as effective as this one but without the frustration of D.O.A. electronics and the accompanying D.O.A. customer service.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s worth upgrading too.</li>
            <li> Worth the money.</li>
            <li> I wanted something with a timer for each section of my mouth but that was fun.</li>
            <li> It is actually fun to use.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> After about a weeks worth of using the whitening brush head paired with the whitening setting on the brush itself</li>
            <li> Worth the investment for dental health!&lt;br /&gt;KLB</li>
            <li> Kids always laugh at the smiley face.</li>
            <li> It was many many years ago, so i&#x27;m not really</li>
            <li> I used to be able to charge my old one overnight.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Philips battery technology seems so far (2 months in) far superior: the unit lasts longer per charge and does not lose any battery life over time.</li>
            <li> the last 6 years I have used the very affordable Oral-B Vitality line with good success.  </li>
            <li> This toothbrush just feels better in your hand, and has better reach to remote areas of your mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s a clock when not in use, but I haven&#x27;t been able to set the clock so far (and I stopped trying).</li>
            <li> If you are short on counter space, as I am, this is a handy feature.</li>
            <li> The monitor may be useful if you have children</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ll worth the investment for your family.</li>
            <li> I feel this was worth the investment.</li>
            <li> /&gt;To sum up, most of the fancy features of this toothbrush weren&#x27;t as sophisticated as I&#x27;d expected</li>
            <li> The timer/clock is a nice feature because not only do appreciate the brushing timer</li>
            <li> Many brush choices available for what ever your personal want is.  </li>
            <li> I was golden.</li>
            <li> It cleans my teeth better than my old electric tooth brush.</li>
            <li> You definetly feel the difference with a fresh charge.</li>
            <li> worth every penny.</li>
            <li> The time is so much fun and helpful.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a much more complete and cost effectivesystem.    </li>
            <li> Totally worth the money.</li>
            <li> No doubt that your mouth is fresh.</li>
            <li> Top notch and professional.</li>
            <li> Worth the money.</li>
            <li> also found the Oral-B more tolerable for my sensitive teeth than the Sonicare.  </li>
            <li> Wifi, Dish Network remotes, Senn 180 wireless headphones and Logitech M510 mouse are all important to me, but adding anything more is a dubious proposition - especially if it is unnecessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If they love brushing their teeth, do it correctly and prevent cavities I am happy!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Oral B for making such a fabulous product.</li>
            <li> I have read some complaints about the floss action heads, but I personally love it.  </li>
            <li> well worth the money..  </li>
            <li> This model does a more thorough job of cleaning and is has some flexibility that my old unit does not.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Definitely worth the money.  </li>
            <li> To be honest, I only floss on rare occasions, but because of the use of this toothbrush I fooled my dentist.</li>
            <li> Works better than Phillips Sonicare by far.  </li>
            <li> Well worth buying it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is worth every penny.</li>
            <li> most professional.  </li>
            <li> It works better than my old Philips (over 100 bucks) one.  </li>
            <li> I can both feel the bristle action when brushing, and my periodic appointments with the hygienist have gone well (better than before the Oral-B).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two</li>
            <li> I sprung for this electric toothbrush and it is well worth the money.</li>
            <li> This unit is suprisingly powerful.  </li>
            <li> There are so many things that are better than my last one (of course that one was quite old)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t played with the settings much, I have been stuck on the floss setting.</li>
            <li> This device has the same circular motion that is on the equipment in the dentist&#x27;s office and does seem to do a better job of getting some food particles out from between teeth (not that good so flossing still necessary!).  </li>
            <li> Trips to the dentist seem to prove its worth, but I wish the battery was consumer replaceable.</li>
            <li> So far I am thoroughly satisfied with the performance of this product.  </li>
            <li> This brush is powerful and fun to brush with.&lt;br</li>
            <li> this product worth any penny  </li>
            <li> My 6-month cleanings and checkups are a complete joke now, I sit in the chair and ask him why I even bother to do these routine visits any more.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone, its totally worth the money.</li>
            <li> Dentist recommended this, if you can afford it way worth it.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> to the more forceful action of the head, but</li>
            <li> I got to see a Triumph at my oral hygenist and realized that the newer ones were faster and with more capabilities than my old one</li>
            <li> I use the setting for sensitive teeth, and my gums are getting better.  </li>
            <li> It is a great tooht brush, a big change from my old oral-b tooht brush I had.</li>
            <li> I do not believe there is any reason to upgrade to the 5000 even though have a digital display is nice but not a must have.</li>
            <li> but it is well worth it.</li>
            <li> This has a lot more power and pulsations than the old one.  </li>
            <li> Do hesitate to purchase this brush because your teeth are worth every penny and you need your teeth for the rest of your life</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s got all the bells and whistles that make brushing your teeth fun.  </li>
            <li> This means you can have different types of brush heads for your own use OR one for each family member</li>
            <li> #34;my mouth feels so different -- very clean !&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> B003UKM9CO Oral-B Professional Healthy Clean Precision 1000]] toothbrushes, and this is a real improvement upon them.</li>
            <li> I have three of the several types of brush heads and am fully satisfied with their unique performance.</li>
            <li> After less than two weeks I already am amazed by the remarkable results:  not just in cleaning, but also, in comfort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Once Oral B started introducing more than two modes, it should have though about simplifying access to any particular mode, such as being able to change the default.  </li>
            <li> It is easy to set-up and use and I love the timer that tells you how long to brush in each area!</li>
            <li> Packaging was easy to open and everything was easy to assemble.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The new Smart Guide display is cute and informative, but I do not find it extremely useful.  </li>
            <li> the timer is great - it even does double duty as a nice small clock in the bathroom.</li>
            <li> This seems superior to other electric toothbrushes</li>
            <li> right when I need to plug it</li>
            <li> I have two problems with this purchase right off the bat:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Something, however, doesn&#x27;t set right with me about a toothbrush with a lithium battery that can&#x27;t be replaced.</li>
            <li> Yes, that&#x27;s right folks.</li>
            <li> I made the right choice.</li>
            <li> so you will brush your teeth for the right amount of time.</li>
            <li> It just doesn&#x27;t do it right.  </li>
            <li> The power is just right.  </li>
            <li> Stuck it right to my mirror and it helps me to keep moving along</li>
            <li> Right now this Braun is charging and is at 2/3 charged since 0700 hours til now 1840 hours.  </li>
            <li> as the right tool for the job.</li>
            <li> It took me quite awhile, trying to find the right one, and for me, this is it...</li>
            <li> I now know that I made the right choice buying it.</li>
            <li> It cleans much better than the usual Oral-B, and the timer is nice, serves as a clock, too.</li>
            <li> My mouth and teeth really feel clean when I finish brushing with this toothbrush</li>
            <li> It is also MUCH easier to clean.  </li>
            <li> I have been in love with the Braun Oral-B electric toothbrush since I bought my first in the early 1990s.</li>
            <li> It has really made a difference in how clean my mouth feels.  </li>
            <li> + timer makes it very easy to regularly brush correctly.  </li>
            <li> While I&#x27;m enjoying the clean feeling from brushing as the 5000 does seem to give me better brushing results, I am not sure I would recommend the brush.  </li>
            <li> Very smart too with</li>
            <li> This brush feels great, less intense than a Sonicare, and the head moves as well as vibrates....</li>
            <li> Love that it does a thorough job, fairly quiet and recharges quickly.</li>
            <li> in all I would definitely recommend this for someone looking for a new toothbrush as I feel it does a great job and includes plenty of extras for a decent price.</li>
            <li> so you can move from one corner of your mouth to the next quadrant and complete the entire mouth in two minutes which should provide an excellent cleaning.&lt;br</li>
            <li> far this is the best I ever have, the most expensive those&lt;br /&gt;All</li>
            <li> /&gt;In general, the Sonicare is more like the cleaning tool used by the hygenist.  </li>
            <li> and he said that generally he likes his brushes to cover a bit more of the tooth area</li>
            <li> After about a month of use, I generally wold say I am satisfied with this purchase.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty fun to use</li>
            <li> She barely had to do anything for her cleaning, was mostly just polishing.  </li>
            <li> It almost ruins everything good about this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> the timer is nice, as it serves as a clock as well as the guide for how long you should be brushing..</li>
            <li> There is a case to cover the brushes, a timer that informs you how long to brush each quadrant and the cleaning experience is really nice.</li>
            <li> The floss action head contains 4 plastic prongs that are loosely attached so they have a great deal of movement when the head rotates.  </li>
            <li> so I keep good dental habits, but between dentist checkups I have a tendency to have really severe staining even though I&#x27;m not very much of a coffee, tea, or soda drinker.  </li>
            <li> Like any electric toothbrush, the heads do wear a little quickly, but Amazon has pretty good deals on replacements.</li>
            <li> This is a little skeevy for me, because I&#x27;d think there&#x27;s a bit of the other user&#x27;s toothpaste/saliva residue, but give it a good cleaning after each use, and you&#x27;re good.</li>
            <li> Awesome little toothbrush that has definitely improved my oral health.</li>
            <li> Excellent product that, at the very least, gives me the impression that my teeth are much cleaner.  </li>
            <li> I was ready to pay higher better quality, also the idea of having a screen to guide you brush sounded very developed to me.</li>
            <li> It does a great job cleaning my teeth, and I have very few complaints about its style, build quality, or feature set.  </li>
            <li> It does a great job cleaning my teeth, and I have very few complaints about its style, build quality, or feature set.  </li>
            <li> Also good for kids since it has the light up sensor if you push too hard.  </li>
            <li> Very fast, love the options, the add on tray is useful, allowing my husband and I to store our toothbrushes neatly right next to the toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> new model is fantastic.</li>
            <li> and I would certainly recommend to friends and family!</li>
            <li> My husband and I purchased two Oral-B Professional Healthy Clean + Floss Action Precision 5000 Rechargeable Electric Toothbrushes and couldn&#x27;t be happier.  </li>
            <li> : incredibly, in 2013, Oral B&#x27;s Customer Service Rep actually told me to send the unit to an authorized repair center at my expense.</li>
            <li> I would recommend the Sonicare over the Oral-B Professional Healthy Clean + Floss Action</li>
            <li> The remote display is fun, and kind of motivating.</li>
            <li> Come to think of it, the free cheap plastic toothbrush I just got from my dentist has a deep cleaning mode, too.</li>
            <li> Controlling gum infection with good home care and regular professional cleaning has been linked to a 50% reduction in strokes and heart attacks.  </li>
            <li> I love that this toothbrush comes with the independent clock, which is useful even when not using the toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Also shows the regular clock time in between brushing, which is nice to keep track of when you&#x27;re getting ready for work or whatever.&lt;br /&gt;-The</li>
            <li> Easy to use and not messy as some reviews have stated</li>
            <li> Love this tooth brush, the initial charging took over 24 hours to charge, but worth the wait.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The orthodontist wants my kids using an Oral B while in braces, as he says it cleans better with the floss action than a Sonicare around all that hardware.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed my teeth are far cleaner, and my whole mouth seems to be in better health.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good caliber toothbrush, but a cheaper build than the previous model.  </li>
            <li> Oral-B uses standard heads and chargers throughout their product line so this makes all my old accessories compatible -- a good thing.</li>
            <li> The features are great, it doesn&#x27;t require any effort to brush my teeth like a regular toothbrush, simply hold it on your teeth, and the brush does all the work!</li>
            <li> also love the 2 min setting in 30 sec intervals for precise cleaning.</li>
            <li> I before applied more pressure destroying my gums but now I am much pleased.</li>
            <li> so i bought the current model of my original and one of these new imiproved more powerful ones, the Precision 5000</li>
            <li> As with any toothbrush, manual or electric, it is still very important to floss daily.  </li>
            <li> I like this very much.  </li>
            <li> like this toothbrush very much</li>
            <li> I like it very much.</li>
            <li> (Ok for the US, not for Europe or South America)&amp;#62; Probably my fault, I am just hightlighting this in case this is important for other customer as well.</li>
            <li> Battery lasts a good 2 weeks; has same problem as previous version in that recharging takes more than 12 hours.</li>
            <li> It is also a little bulky, and has s fair amount of weight to it.  </li>
            <li> there where no instructions in the new packaging or helpful hints like the original box might of had.</li>
            <li> Leaves teeth feeling extra clean and smooth.  </li>
            <li> The main problem with the old one was the battery was junk, so I couldn&#x27;t use it more than a couple days without it running out.  </li>
            <li> The price seems a bit steep at first (compared to traditional brushes) but the clean you get is incomparable.  </li>
            <li> The price seems a bit steep at first (compared to traditional brushes) but the clean you get is incomparable.  </li>
            <li> toothbrushes with the little yellow rubber bristles are the best and get the teeth much cleaner than the brushes without them!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> toothbrushes with the little yellow rubber bristles are the best and get the teeth much cleaner than the brushes without them!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> ;)  </li>
            <li> - I love that it holds multiple brush heads.  </li>
            <li> The first charge took about 24 hours, but after that it seems to charge fully in about 8 hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The first charge took about 24 hours, but after that it seems to charge fully in about 8 hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love the clock also and it lets me properly brush my teeth</li>
            <li> I read through many of the low reviews on this</li>
            <li> live.&lt;br /&gt;Two exact toothbrushes,...</li>
            <li> I am treating the 5000 exactly the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is my first electric brush.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve paid much more than the cost of this device for surgery on my gums and related dental visits.</li>
            <li> It splashes all over the place and when I put it in the dock to charge it drips so my mirror and my counter top constantly have toothpaste on it now.</li>
            <li> The first was the rubber feet at the bottom of the handle.</li>
            <li> I have been a user of Braun electric toothbrushes for 20 years, ever since the first generation.  </li>
            <li> Love that this has several speed/setting.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> It works much better than the under-$20 Oral-B vitality with a regular brush head.  </li>
            <li> and I am sure my next one will be oral B-5000 or newer version.</li>
            <li> I woke up the entire neighborhood!  :)</li>
            <li> I love having the digital clock on my bathroom mirror.  </li>
            <li> I like that the extra brush holder isn&#x27;t attached so that it saves room on the counter top.</li>
            <li> The separate viewing piece isn&#x27;t necessary if you&#x27;re going to pick a favorite speed and stick to it.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t drip inside and get filled with mildew like happened with my old Sonicare.</li>
            <li> That is saying people with uncontrolled periodontal disease have a 50% or higher risk of having a stroke or heart</li>
            <li> They may like the smiley face and the stars that light up as they complete each quadrant.</li>
            <li> This is the second Oral-B toothbrush we have bought and love them.</li>
            <li> First time that&#x27;s ever happened</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty dumb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> is fun to us to keep track on how much longer on this quadrant</li>
            <li> It has a timer to make sure that each quadrant of the mouth is given proper attention.</li>
            <li> First time electric toothbrush user.</li>
            <li> This model has more bells and whistles than I need, but it makes my mouth feel cleaner than brushing with a regular toothbrush.</li>
            <li> love the multiple settings.</li>
            <li> Wish it came with more toothbrushes as it only came with one flossing brush.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Oral-B now for several weeks and glad I went with this.  </li>
            <li> &#x27;s talk about the head shape firstly.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t think I would ever wear out my first toothbrush</li>
            <li> Charging stand was cheapen somewhat since my first Oral-B</li>
            <li> The product was shipped fast!</li>
            <li> I love the timer that came with it and the multiple brush holder.</li>
            <li> Love the seperate display and different cleaning levels.</li>
            <li> This is my first electric toothbrush and it works well.</li>
            <li> Fast, as described, and well packed!</li>
            <li> First impressions:&lt;br /&gt;1</li>
            <li> Once you are able to contact a customer service rep, the process is pretty simple.</li>
            <li> Overall a 4 because I still feel like it could be faster motion or more of a sonic motion.</li>
            <li> The pulsations seem pretty well set.</li>
            <li> It has different speeds for great cleaning, whether you want deep cleaning to gentle cleaning for those with tender gums.  </li>
            <li> After first use saw a difference.</li>
            <li> I love the toothbrush, but was quite irritated to find that it came with only 1 brush head (when I bought its predecessor I got 4 brushes).  </li>
            <li> kinda placed me among the most hygienic they see...and the only thing I changed in my routine is the toothbrush.</li>
            <li> It came when it was scheduled or before and it does exactly what it advertises it will do.  </li>
            <li> This is my first experience with an electric toothbrush</li>
            <li> We are still using the first one</li>
            <li> Maybe it could be more heads in starting complect.</li>
            <li> My periodontist sold me the first one about 7 years ago and it has improved the state of my gums and teeth immeasurably.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush is exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> The only downside is the goofy display.</li>
            <li> /&gt;In contrast, the Oral-B seems to be more designed to actually gets its bristles into spaces, and to massage your gums.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;So, while I have not used the simpler models in the Oral-B \\&quot;Professional\\&quot; line, I would recommend that you consider those, especially since they look like a much better dollar value.</li>
            <li> but I wanted to try to see if this unit&#x27;s 5 different cleaning option would be better for me as I have a tendency to over brush and cause gum issues.  </li>
            <li> The 30 seconds and 2 minutes marks are now more definite, and there is an additional audio beep.</li>
            <li> Thank you so much Oral-B!</li>
            <li> Then wait for them to repair (or more likely replace)</li>
            <li> First one lasted 6 years until my youngest thought he should bang it on the sink</li>
            <li> The battery life is outstanding could let you brush ten days strait without charging.</li>
            <li> My second oral-b and we love it.  </li>
            <li> Of course you could have more kept in another place if your family was larger.</li>
            <li> First time I have uses a power tooth brush</li>
            <li> It has a timer indicator for two minutes of brushing, she amusingly stated she mentally gets alot of planning mapped out for the day.</li>
            <li> So after buying 2 more heads we ended up spending about the same.</li>
            <li> Used the prior version for many years until the battery went out.</li>
            <li> first I thought the timer/pressure sensor was hokey, but then I realized when using it that a)</li>
            <li> So far it is fantastic.</li>
            <li> This is my first electric toothbrush, recommended to me by my family dentist and oral hygienist.</li>
            <li> and I eat a LOT of sweets;)</li>
            <li> /&gt;This really is better for smaller mouths, my kids were only able to start using an Oral B when they got to be about</li>
            <li> And it does default to a clock when you are not using it, a feature I find myself using pretty often.  </li>
            <li> First power brush I have ever owned.</li>
            <li> Sense\\&quot; technology to make you aware of your brushing habits.</li>
            <li> and I find myself paying more attention to my gums, my mucosa, and tongue in my daily routine.</li>
            <li> first time I used it I couldn&#x27;t believe the difference it made</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t keep your lips tightly closed over the unit so you have to keep a Kleenex handy to catch the drips.</li>
            <li> The texture of the grip is different, and the body and buttons are more ergonomic to use.</li>
            <li> 5/5 stars, still the same great Precision 5000 but with some minor tweaks.</li>
            <li> I thought I&#x27;d replace it with a higher end model.  </li>
            <li> I was pretty upset I did not make the move to electric toothbrushes</li>
            <li> With the 5000 I now have no problem brushing 2 minutes and most times I brush an extra minute.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the first electrci one for me</li>
            <li> I researched it first with my friend who is a dentist...guess what?</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The remote display is a nice touch</li>
            <li> We have an earlier version of this toothbrush and love the updates to the design.  </li>
            <li> However having used them both I do give the Oral-b the top marks for overall effectiveness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Other then that I love it!</li>
            <li> electric toothbrushes, this is exceptionally powerful with fast rotation.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, the toothbrush performance is still stellar.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, the toothbrush performance is still stellar.  </li>
            <li> I had used a Sonicare for ten plus years and didn&#x27;t think there was anything  better.  </li>
            <li> love it will not go back to manual brushing ,</li>
            <li> makes sure you cover every area in the 30 second time frames allowed.  </li>
            <li> Exactly what I want in an electronic toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> I really enjoy this toothbrush over my old Sonicare.  </li>
            <li> First thing I checked if it had a dual volt charger.</li>
            <li> love all the different cleaning options that this toothbrush has to offer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It provides a comfortable and stimulating scrubbing action to your teeth and gum-line, but isn&#x27;t overly aggressive to cause discomfort.  </li>
            <li> Long lasting on battery charge &amp; does a great job on my teeth.</li>
            <li> This is a technical machine that will take more reading of the manual and training on my part.</li>
            <li> I tried to charge it for the first time overseas where it is 220.</li>
            <li> but I have the same toothbrush and love it.  </li>
            <li> We  have owned different Oral B power toothbrushes over the years with the latest being the 1000 and the 4000.  </li>
            <li> Love the features, such as timer and pressure sensitivity alarm.</li>
            <li> ;-)</li>
            <li> this is the first electric toothbrush for me</li>
            <li> I love the timer that beeps every 30 seconds so you can give equal time to all areas of your mouth</li>
            <li> but I had better experience with prior Oral-B products</li>
            <li> First of all me and my wife are orthodontists, so I know what I am talking about.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t my first Oral-B toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not quite sure why the brush head that was included in the package was the Floss-Action head, rather than the standard ProWhite head..</li>
            <li> Well maybe not, but regular brushing with it reduces the plaque mining at the dentists office, which makes that experience a lot better.</li>
            <li> Good toothbrush, round head reaches space along gums, and between teeth.</li>
            <li> I laughed when I saw the device and thought it was gimmicky, but now I am hooked and watch the screen.</li>
            <li> If you are new to them, it may provide a bit too much buzz for you to immediately become comfortable</li>
            <li> It has been awhile since I purchased an electric tooth brush, and so far, we pleased with our new addition to our bathroom shelf.  </li>
            <li> Teeth feel clean and my dental hygienist even commented on how clean my teeth were on the last visit.</li>
            <li> In time, I learned the right amount of pressure to apply, thanks to this sensor, and the sensor no longer interrupts my brushing.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Considering the technology of today it could have been much more sophisticated and helpful without being more expensive - its a real shame.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not necessarily bad, just different (and my teeth feel as clean as ever).    </li>
            <li> I use the deep cleaning mode and my teeth are very clean.</li>
            <li> In theory, it sounds great, but the little display unit seems like overkill for adult brushes.  </li>
            <li> I do feel my gums are a bit cleaner, though I did a pretty good job brushing prior with my regular toothbrush.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush required more time to charge (the first time) than I expected, but was worth the wait.  </li>
            <li> The best part is, if you brush long enough to get that extra bonus star, you will sometimes (not every time) be greeted with a winking smiley face.  </li>
            <li> and so far feel that it is definitely worth the price!</li>
            <li> It arrived quickly and was new in the package</li>
            <li> This is a nice replacement, but the Triumph was a much better product, used the same brush heads, and only cost a few dollars more.</li>
            <li> This is a nice replacement, but the Triumph was a much better product, used the same brush heads, and only cost a few dollars more.</li>
            <li> The Oral-B Professional makes my teeth feel just from the dentist clean.  </li>
            <li> I bought the Oral_B Professional Health Clean at the recommendation of my dentist.</li>
            <li> B0002KHU3I Oral-B Professional Dual Clean Replacement Brush Head 3 Count]]</li>
            <li> The brush heads are easy to replace, and there are many different types of heads to suit different oral care needs.</li>
            <li> This is a phenomenal toothbrush -- a real keeper -- but had to return mine because the accompanying digital display was D.O.A. ...</li>
            <li> I bought it mostly because it lights up in red if you apply to much pressure.</li>
            <li> I have gum disease, and can&#x27;t seem to floss enough, or good enough.</li>
            <li> I initially bought this for myself and love it so much that I bought one for all of  my children.  </li>
            <li> The toothbrush definitely does a good job in getting between the teeth and under the gums but something with a slightly bigger head might&#x27;ve made this product</li>
            <li> The nice thing about the 3000 (I&#x27;ve now discovered) is that, even though it has 3 modes, you get to sensitive mode second.</li>
            <li> I had more satisfactory results by ordering the \\&quot;Oral-B Professional Sensitive Gum Care Replacement Brush Head\\&quot; (also on Amazon).  </li>
            <li> The Floss Action brush heads do such an effective job that my dentist always compliments me on how well I floss.  </li>
            <li> The charge really does last 5 days, and the travel case is much more functional than the ziplock bag I used to use.  </li>
            <li> Well worth the savings I get from not having to pay high dental bills.</li>
            <li> The only thing it doesn&#x27;t clean is between teeth, so don&#x27;t forget to floss!</li>
            <li> I am now a loyal fan of the Oral B Floss Action toothbrush!</li>
            <li> design is exceedingly clever, helping you avoid excess force, actively warning you with lights and alerts to not apply excess pressure - very effective protection for sensitive tissues.  </li>
            <li> a positive note though</li>
            <li> The handle is pretty large, but not too large.</li>
            <li> The stand gets pretty grimy fast, and has to be cleaned weekly.  </li>
            <li> nitpick is that you pretty much have to keep the brush charging or it will be sluggish after two or three brushings.  </li>
            <li> I did not see the point in dropping so much money for a higher end model.</li>
            <li> short, I love and prefer this newer model which is roughly 50-100% more oscillations.</li>
            <li> It takes the toothbrush a long time to charge, and it does not stay charged many days.</li>
            <li> As a long time Sonicare user I was reluctant to believe that anything was better than the Sonicare.</li>
            <li> I love the timer that shows me how long I need to brush my teeth for.</li>
            <li> They are pretty much identical.  </li>
            <li> as more time went on, the red light went up constantly, and now it can no longer hold a charge</li>
            <li> The floss action brushes are kinda cool.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with this product as long as it lasts long enough to justify the price.</li>
            <li> Unbelievably this good toothbrush comes with a 110-130 power supply.  </li>
            <li> The deep clean and massage modes were well worth it.</li>
            <li> I like the head on this brush better than the the new OralB sonic because I have a small mouth and this head just fits better.  </li>
            <li> I used the Sonicare right after a cleaning, so it was too soon to say if it was equally effective (and I am now going to shift back to it, and will update my review later with those impressions).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> In all the years that I&#x27;ve had my Oral B brushes, my dentists have always said that my teeth look good, and I&#x27;ve had very few cavities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> : (  I liked it very much - very nice sleek design and charging options, not too loud, teeth felt really clean . . .</li>
            <li> First one was amazing, I&#x27;ve traveled with it a lot and just after 3 years of everyday usage</li>
            <li> The travel carrier is nice but could be a bit less bulky and sturdier.  </li>
            <li> brush is easy to use for several reasons.  </li>
            <li> The set I got came with two \\&quot;normal\\&quot; heads, a super soft one, and one meant to reach hard-to-get crevices.</li>
            <li> I first tried a cheap, generic brand one</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s too easy to accidentally erode the gum line through regular use.  </li>
            <li> This revised Precision 5000 is a really solid toothbrush, easy to set up, and works just fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is easy to use and works well in all areas of the mouth, including the hard-to-get back areas of the mouth.</li>
            <li> The only think that it seems a bit strong for my gums.</li>
            <li> This is my first experience with an electric toothbrush with this kind of power and feature set, and it makes manual brushing seem like a waste of time.</li>
            <li> So much better than the single option I had for the Sonicare Essence.    </li>
            <li> But unless mine is faulty it doesn&#x27;t seem that smart.</li>
            <li> The display that comes with it is unnecessarily large though in my opinion.</li>
            <li> 9900 Power Toothbrush with Smart Guide]]</li>
            <li> I went to Oral-B&#x27;s website for service (certainly at 6 months it still should be under warranty).  </li>
            <li> The smart guide tells you where to brush. . .</li>
            <li> \\&quot;Smart</li>
            <li> /&gt;i don&#x27;t understand how the monitor (smart guide) work .</li>
            <li> and I also like smart guide to that</li>
            <li> The smart guide is a battery operated clock that has a smiley face on it with a circle around it and stars on the bottom of the screen.  </li>
            <li> you turn on the toothbrush the clock on the smart guide disappears and a timer starts listing the time you use the toothbrush.</li>
            <li> The smart guide helps me  brush for the recommended amount of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;This model comes with a charger, one head, a traveling case and a separate wireless smart guide unit.</li>
            <li> The traveling case is large and bulky.</li>
            <li> The smart guide helps you stay on track and brush each quadrant and brush for 2 minutes</li>
            <li> upper left top of mouth / upper right top of</li>
            <li> I contacted Oral B again and they sent another Smart Guide it too does not sync with the toothbrush</li>
            <li> It seems to me that there are a lot of electric toothbrushes out there and while the Oral-B Professional Healthy Clean + Floss Action Precision 5000 does the job, if I could go back in time, I&#x27;d probably try another brand.  </li>
            <li> Fortunately, the instructions are not long and they seemed readable to me.  </li>
            <li> It helps me get the back of my bottom front teeth much more effectively (because of the small head and the movement).  </li>
            <li> Unless you own a soldering kit, a T6 screwdriver and possess the savvy to do basic electronics, you will eventually be tossing this thing into the garbage can or sending it off for \\&quot;repair\\&quot; (not sure what this costs or how many weeks</li>
            <li> This new one needs to be recharged for the better part of a day if it has been used for several brushings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> or better, finally had to get a new one</li>
            <li> This model, the Smart Series 5000 HEALTH CLEAN + FLOSS ACTION model has some improvements over the older models which some of us were still using, so I could compare them side by side.</li>
            <li> They last for years, do a great job, and can be had for less than $20.  </li>
            <li> each brush can be programmed easily for two different brushes, which is really convenient.  </li>
            <li> each brush can be programmed easily for two different brushes, which is really convenient.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s is easy to get distracted and not spend enough time or get start thinking and spend way too much in one area.&lt;br /&gt;Let</li>
            <li> The external guide isn&#x27;t super useful, but does keep you on track to ensure you&#x27;re brushing for two minutes.</li>
            <li> This electric brush will clean your teeth in a manner far superior to any manual brush, and for that matter, much better than certain inexpensive electrics such as the [[ASIN:B0014AI4VM Spinbrush Pro]], which I had been using for a few years prior.  </li>
            <li> They really aren&#x27;t useful at all unless you have very sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li> Only (1) is included, and it seems fine for my purposes.</li>
            <li> the communication between the brush and accessory uses a certain amount of battery life on both devices, but I never took the time to determine how much.</li>
            <li> With the smart guild clock-timer it&#x27;ll even warns you if you are applying to much pressure.</li>
            <li> The smiley face on the read out is a nice coaching tool that gives you a  little bit of immediate gratification.</li>
            <li> The only downside to it is it tends to make more of a mess (more splatter).</li>
            <li> Seems to clean better, I&#x27;m anxious to to see how we&#x27;ll</li>
            <li> The 5000 feels a little bit more powerful, and it has a longer battery life as well.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> The charge lasts quite a long time, and my teeth are CLEAN!</li>
            <li> Was told my gums very healthy and no cavities with very little work needed from the hygienist.</li>
            <li> This new shape to the stand is stable and won&#x27;t tip over, it is more stable than older model&#x27;s recharging stands which were smaller and just wider than the toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Use too much pressure, and the handle and monitor light up red.</li>
            <li> Overall a gentle cleaning that provides fantastic results.</li>
            <li> For example, the pressure warning (when you press the brush too much upon your teeth), now has a red light element as well.</li>
            <li> toothbrush comes with five cleaning modes which are daily clean, deep clean, sensitive clean, whitening and massage.</li>
            <li> I really feel like my mouth is cleaner after using my $20 Oral B.</li>
            <li> My teeth are so much whiter</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think I would use this feature as much as I do.  </li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> My teeth feel so much cleaner after using this.</li>
            <li> , I really do feel like my teeth get cleaner than they ever have before.</li>
            <li> The brush works very well.</li>
            <li> We are much happier with the Oral B company.</li>
            <li> Thanks for offering it for sale</li>
            <li> The travel case is actually very convenient.</li>
            <li> and I know I don&#x27;t have the money to replace the whole thing each year.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> Who wants this?    </li>
            <li> How am I suppose to be responsible when I cannot remove the battery?  </li>
            <li> and yet does it gently.</li>
            <li> and I really like it.</li>
            <li> I had the triumph design for 10 years before it quit on me (it was still trying, just not holding charge and not working w as much umph).</li>
            <li> As for settings, who knows if they really do anything, but I&#x27;ll continue to tell myself they do.</li>
            <li> I find it very helpful</li>
            <li> It is much cheaper.</li>
            <li> I use the toothbrush on the highest setting and I really feel my teeth are much cleaner than before.  </li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t seem to work very well.</li>
            <li> in hand and red light pressure alert.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unobtrusive beeps.</li>
            <li> , I really like the timer it comes with</li>
            <li> only 1 light was blinking and still blinking after 12 hours.  </li>
            <li> but I think my check up will go very well.</li>
            <li> If you have a family that uses this, the costs can add up very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> still really like this toothbrush, but...</li>
            <li> Everybody should have confidence on the product of Germany, it make my teeth healthier and it acts like a babysitter caring my teeth gently and warm-hearted.</li>
            <li> After using the toothbrush I can defiantly feel a difference on how much cleaner my teeth feel.</li>
            <li> And the charging stand is very convenient for storage and charging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this toothbrush!</li>
            <li> I really like that</li>
            <li> The receive of the gift really likes it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t a toothbrush shutting itself off if I apply too much pressure.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush works really well. .</li>
            <li> I really like the timer.  </li>
            <li> It really does keep me in track.</li>
            <li> .. cleans well fast shipping</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product!  </li>
            <li> His teeth are looking much whiter.</li>
            <li> It cleans my teeth and gums very well.  </li>
            <li> I really recommend it.  </li>
            <li> That gives me so much peace of mind.</li>
            <li> Really eliminates plaque.  </li>
            <li> The time is very clearliy heard from the &amp;#34;beep&amp;#34; of the brush.</li>
            <li> I really like the timer that beeps every 30 seconds signaling it&#x27;s time to move to another quadrant of your mouth.  </li>
            <li> It is a very well thought product.</li>
            <li> really solid.&lt;br /&gt;-Great</li>
            <li> I changed from Sonicare to try this brush, but it has a much lower frequency than Sonicare; this causes me to have dizziness and nausea when brushing my teeth.</li>
            <li> I always feel like it cleans my teeth really well.</li>
            <li> until I realized I didn&#x27;t really need it for anything</li>
            <li> The brush has a red flashing light to warn you about the pressure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s a lot louder than my prior toothbrush and not all that smooth.  </li>
            <li> For my needs and wants.</li>
            <li> This quality alone is what really sold me on the brush.    </li>
            <li> Timer very helpful...</li>
            <li> Feels like my whole skull is vibrating!&lt;br /&gt;At</li>
            <li> Coupled with an Waterpik water flosser that I bought from Amazon as well, my teeth feel and look much healthier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Really like the clock.</li>
            <li> and my hygienist is seeing much improvements.</li>
            <li> Works very well.  </li>
            <li> It really cleaned my teeth</li>
            <li> The Triumph series only blinked a recessed light on the LCD.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
            <li> This holder is a much simpler design that prevents accumulation, and that&#x27;s way easier to clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So I really don&#x27;t like brushing my teeth.</li>
            <li> I really like this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really use them.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> I really like how it beeps to tell you to go on.  </li>
            <li> Highly reccommended!</li>
            <li> Very please with this upgrade.</li>
            <li> Very usable.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this!</li>
            <li> My teeth feel much cleaner after using the Oral-B tooth brush than it does after using the manual tooth brush.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m quite happy with the different settings and also the different settings from time to time for deep cleaning and massaging my gums.</li>
            <li> and I really like the way</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this!</li>
            <li> If too much pressure is applied, a sensor will stop the motor for about two seconds and the toothbrush will beep.</li>
            <li> The charger itself is very convenient, lightweight, and subtle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I would absolutely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> this toothbrush works really well.  </li>
            <li> So if you really want to go all out and get a toothbrush that does everything for you, this is it.  </li>
            <li> This is the third version, purchased it primarily for travel</li>
            <li> do enjoy the deep cleaning mode that this model has as well..</li>
            <li> Very self explanatory.  </li>
            <li> Compared to the one I just replaced this one feels way more rough on my teeth and gums.  </li>
            <li> It even lets you know if you&#x27;re applying too much pressure.</li>
            <li> I absolutely adore it.  </li>
            <li> Much like your cell phone.</li>
            <li> Highly Recommended!</li>
            <li> I wish my weedwhacker had that much power.  </li>
            <li> digit timer is also a very convenient bathroom clock as well.</li>
            <li> But this Oral-B PC 5000 is a real bummer.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> My husband used to use too much pressure while brushing; this toothbrush alerts him as well as adjusts when he&#x27;s overdoing it.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> This takes getting used to if you have used a toothbrush your whole life.  </li>
            <li> i was looking so much time for guide for this.&lt;br</li>
            <li> do not use the smartguide that came with the toothbrush because I really don&#x27;t need it</li>
            <li> He found the remote indicator helpful and entertaining.  </li>
            <li> The motor has a whole lot of kick so, if you&#x27;ve been neglecting your teeth and gums (tsk, tsk), then I recommend putting it on a gentler setting than its defaults.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My wife however hates how much it rattles her head when she uses it.  </li>
            <li> Clean\\&quot; mode which really means \\&quot;Longer Brush Time\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> The Sonicare has a much slimmer design.  </li>
            <li> Really, just buy another oral B</li>
            <li> It is more than I expected.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> got this for my wife , she loves them , they really look real</li>
            <li> , it works really well and doesn&#x27;t need a charge for quite awhile.</li>
            <li> THAT APPEARS IF YOU APPLY TOO MUCH PRESSURE.  </li>
            <li> whole kit includes everything you need.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li> My wife, who goes through brush heads way too fast has had to adjust as well.  </li>
            <li> My dental hygienist recommended this model as it is the one that she uses and she is very fussy about teeth cleaning.</li>
            <li> I really, really dislike it, and I tend to watch the timer so that I know when to pause brushing.</li>
            <li> It lights up one star for every 30 seconds you brush, and the goal is to light up 4-stars to indicate you have brushed for the recommended 2 minutes.  </li>
            <li> Really cleans my teeth</li>
            <li> Notwithstanding the vigorous brushing comment, it tells you (via a red light on the brush) if you are overdoing it;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Thanks oral-B.</li>
            <li> My teeth and mouth feel much cleaner.</li>
            <li> The timer is very helpful, and I really do find myself with a cleaner mouth (or so I feel it).  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> If you like really sleek design and neat gadgets, the Philips travel case and charging options are much nicer.  </li>
            <li> This toothbrush really makes a difference.  </li>
            <li> It cleans really really well.</li>
            <li> My daughter-in-law loves it so much that she&#x27;s now buying one for her mother.</li>
            <li> I really like this</li>
            <li> The whole family(3 of us) is using it.</li>
            <li> My teeth feel so much cleaner over a manual toothbrush.</li>
            <li> One of the things I really like is the the way the two minute timer works.</li>
            <li> There are several brush head options available for this toothbrush&lt;br</li>
            <li> My last dentist appt was 4 months ago and my teeth are still build up free...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m amazed by how much cleaner my teeth feel - it sounds corny</li>
            <li> I know how to brush and how much force to apply, and as a result of that, I have never have calculus.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> /&gt;First, the sensor tells if you are exerting too much pressure on the teeth - this is to help prevent enamel abrasion.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> It is very efficient.</li>
            <li> I LOVE the smiley remote timer too.</li>
            <li> Was unsure about the newer version since it had a different charging block and a different battery display, but it&#x27;s just as nice</li>
            <li> &#x27;s be honest, everyone at one time or another has eaten something and then immediately brushed their teeth only to feel that there are some residual food particles in and between their teeth.  </li>
            <li> In this incarnation Oral-B have decided that users need a more clear &amp;#34;signal&amp;#34; when to change which teeth are getting brushed.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an impovement over my last one which was many years old.  </li>
            <li> Nice product the only problem is a short battery charge , I Almost have to chargre this every day .</li>
            <li> It is thick, the sides are smooth, and it tapers toward the top.  </li>
            <li> The real value of this remote device is if you have children, or  just like some thing cute in the bathroom.  </li>
            <li> My son had a battery toothbrush prior to this one and he says this is by far the better of the two.  </li>
            <li> And silly as it may sound, it feels good to always get a \\&quot;five star\\&quot; brushing</li>
            <li> It does a good job to get my children to brush their teeth for at least 2 minutes.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been the kind of person that only brushed his teeth to escape the incriminating stares of his dentist.</li>
            <li> Been in use for a few months, and so far so good.</li>
            <li> A good manual (written in clear English) is included along with the brush and accessories (with the former... gasp...</li>
            <li> clock is nice, but not necessary, but does double as a bathroom clock.  </li>
            <li> The only downside is that the brush on its stand plus the timer take up more space on the sink than my old brush.</li>
            <li> so I am sure I will get used to this, but right now it seems a little cumbersome.    </li>
            <li> The toothbrush system has settings for sensitive gums, deep clean, normal clean, whitening and massage mode.  </li>
            <li> The look is new and there&#x27;s more minor improvements that were made that you can read about.</li>
            <li> To me the wireless guide is a very useful visual cue.</li>
            <li> It was a very worthwhile purchase that I hope will last for a very long time.</li>
            <li> I have gotten pretty good at counting the 30 second intervals and if you over-pressure the brush a red light pops on on the brush (as well as the little monitor).  </li>
            <li> the first one stopped working after 2 years, and never got the rebate on this new one we bought.</li>
            <li> If your teeth build up plaque faster than you can remove it with a manual tooth brush this oral B professional tooth brush may be right for you.&lt;br /&gt;Modern</li>
            <li> With this new model, even this odd area is getting gentle, effective cleaning - and it no longer feels sensitive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> one minor flaw is that mildew builds up inside of the brush heads quite easily..</li>
            <li> I love this features since it saves both money and headaches (having a replacement head for 1 toothbrush when you really need a replacement head for the other toothbrush).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> All other much cheaper models will  have 3 and much more convenient cases.</li>
            <li> We have had an oral b electric tooth brush for years but felt it was slowing down so we purchased this new Oral B Professional &amp; Healthy clean + unit.  </li>
            <li> Gives an absolute deep clean without being too aggressive.</li>
            <li> If your own main use is for whitening, you might want to skip to someone else&#x27;s review, because that is not particularly relevant to me.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The Oral B Professional Health Clean &amp; Brush Action Precision 500 defefinately exceeded every one of my expectations.  </li>
            <li> really like the floss head on the deep clean mode.</li>
            <li> Not only are my teeth very visibly whiter, they are extremely clean.  </li>
            <li> Does it work better than any other brush on the market?</li>
            <li> I have used other electric tooth brushes before but this one is so much better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always owned Sonic Care toothbrushes in the past, but decided to buy Oral B this time - like it MUCH better!</li>
            <li> Oh, OK, I&#x27;ll just pull out that instruction manual I have in my wallet or the other one I have mounted to the bathroom wall.  </li>
            <li> First, the packaging has been improved - it is now similar to Amazon&#x27;s Frustration-Free packaging and most likely better for the environment due to</li>
            <li> but it is better than the Other brand.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does a great job cleaning, and I even found on the day of transitioning from the old to the new model that my teeth felt instantly cleaner with a bit fewer rough spots.</li>
            <li> This battery toothbrush is powerful enough to drive the Floss Action brush head adequately.  </li>
            <li> Even though there are five \\&quot;modes of operation\\&quot; and one of them is 45 seconds per section (deep clean), you cannot set that mode as the default.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure that I&#x27;ll use this feature, but it&#x27;s great to have instead of requiring people to buy multiple toothbrushes (which can get pricey</li>
            <li> My teeth feel really clean and my teeth are staying white.</li>
            <li> so i had finally ordered one and it leaves your teeth feeling so clean.</li>
            <li> Teeth actually stay, that clean feel, longer than hand brushing.</li>
            <li> Brushing has never left my teeth feeling so clean.</li>
            <li> This gets my teeth so clean I only have to brush every three or four days now!</li>
            <li> It is great for children as well as lazy adults such as myself.  </li>
            <li> this is the first tool that we&#x27;ve found useful to get our son to properly brush his teeth.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The brush automatically beeps (in the daily clean cycle)</li>
            <li> clean for 6 months until the next check up.  </li>
            <li> No complaints and my teeth always feel clean, would definitely recommend this brush.</li>
            <li> (30 seconds for each quadrant in daily clean mode).  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m still using this toothbrush, except that the battery BARELY lasts a full 2-minute brush (on normal mode).</li>
            <li> Also, the battery does not last as long as I would have liked.</li>
            <li> I was very sad as I know the normal cost of a new one, but thanks to Amazon I could afford a replacement brush immediately, and best of all it was delivered in 2 days thanks to amazon prime!</li>
            <li> I really like the little clock with the smiley face who frowns at me when i brush too hard and winks when I do a great job!</li>
            <li> Most of my life I&#x27;ve used a manual toothbrush but about 2 years ago I switched to one of those inexpensive electric toothbrushes that are sold right alongside the manual ones in the store (they usually cost around $10).  </li>
            <li> There is even a pressure senor to tell when you are applying to much pressure while you are brushing(also little bright red flash around the where the brush head connects with the power handle.  </li>
            <li> The five different settings, and even the little &amp;#34;smiley&amp;#34; monitor make it a complete system for great oral hygiene.  </li>
            <li> Dry it off after each use, discharge the battery once every few months, and it&#x27;s perfectly happy.</li>
            <li> My dentist told me my plack build up was less than the month before that was good enough for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Cleaning our teeth should be treated as a vital element of one&#x27;s daily personal hygiene regimen, and I highly recommend the [[ASIN:B008PEMOV6 Oral-B Professional Healthy Clean +</li>
            <li> Cleaning our teeth should be treated as a vital element of one&#x27;s daily personal hygiene regimen, and I highly recommend the [[ASIN:B008PEMOV6 Oral-B Professional Healthy Clean +</li>
            <li> The long interruption disrupts smooth brushing of the teeth.    </li>
            <li> In less than two minutes I&#x27;m able to clean my entire mouth.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the first professional toothbrush that I have owned.  </li>
            <li> Nice just to have a small clock in the bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The kit came with extras like four different brush heads, full tube Crest Pro-Health toothpaste/mouthwash and Oral-B flossing tape.  </li>
            <li> I find I need to charge it just short of a week after a full charge (that is with my husband and me both using it twice a day).  </li>
            <li> The whole clock with the smiley face is a bit unnecessary but more importantly the tooth brush works perfectly.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel there is sufficient added value to justify the higher price this model commands over the Professional 3000.</li>
            <li> It is simple to use, and the smiley face on the viewing panel provides ample motivation for me to brush my teeth for a full 2 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My own past experiences with both brands.</li>
            <li> It will also tell you if you have not brushed your full two minutes.</li>
            <li> Even after the first use, it felt as though I had been to the dentist for a professional dental cleaning.</li>
            <li> The first time I used this toothbrush, my teeth felt they had been given a complete overhauling by a dentist.</li>
            <li> is a nice feature, and the docking/charging station also takes up a small footprint, which is nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> caddy holds 4 separate brush heads for 4 different users, and that may be useful for families with kids who share a bathroom and can, thus, share a power toothbrush body, keeping their brush heads separate (different colored rings are available for each brush</li>
            <li> caddy holds 4 separate brush heads for 4 different users, and that may be useful for families with kids who share a bathroom and can, thus, share a power toothbrush body, keeping their brush heads separate (different colored rings are available for each brush</li>
            <li> I know I NEVER brushed for a full two minutes before, and I never focused on a quarter at a time.  </li>
            <li> The different settings are helpful for different tyeps of brushing, my favorite being the deep clean setting.</li>
            <li> It leaves my teeth smooth and clean, not like ordinary toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Horribly disappointed as a I previously had great experiences with Braun products and considered Braun to have a great reputation for quality products and design.  </li>
            <li> Well, our worries are over with the new 5,000!</li>
            <li> It is very nice to have such a wide variety of heads to meet specific needs.</li>
            <li> I really like being able to track how long my son brushes and like the multiple ways the toothbrush detects too much brushing pressure.  </li>
            <li> The charger that comes with the new version is 110v which is ironic</li>
            <li> This new model is very efficient.</li>
            <li> We haven&#x27;t used the polishing cycle yet but can tell you that this is a whole new experience in cleaning your teeth and one you can tell is making a difference.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth the investment and there is no way you will ever get your teeth as clean with a manual brush or with the half as..</li>
            <li> I also had some previous experience with the cheaper versions of the Oral B electric toothbrushes that are designed more for travel which I didn&#x27;t care for at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> OK, a slight exaggeration...</li>
            <li> MUCH better than previous styles.</li>
            <li> More motion, but less intense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This works soooo much better than your typical manual toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I had the previous version for many years and the battery gave out.</li>
            <li> I was able to buy it for 40.00 less</li>
            <li> The cleaning modes for the brush are Daily Clean, Deep Clean, Sensitive, Whitening, and Massage.</li>
            <li> It provides 5 cleaning modes- daily clean, deep clean, sensitive, whitening, and massage.  </li>
            <li> It provides 5 cleaning modes- daily clean, deep clean, sensitive, whitening, and massage.  </li>
            <li> It cleans so much better than the Sonicare I owned previously.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s easy to use, holds a charge for quite awhile, everything I wanted and expected in an electric toothbrush...</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is easy to use and has a wireless remote that counts the time when you start brushing so that you brush your teeth for a minimum of 2 minutes twice a day as recommended by dentists.</li>
            <li> As I am getting older, iI am quite concerned with preserving my teeth.  </li>
            <li> I upgraded from a much older model and after a week my teeth feel like I just visited the dentist.</li>
            <li> I had a older model that died and needed to replace, it was not in stock</li>
            <li> This toothbrush has much more power than the basic models, and five different settings on how that power is applied to your teeth.  </li>
            <li> Decent toothbrush.</li>
            <li> When I saw this product reviewed on Dr. Oz&#x27;s show and found it for a decent price on Amazon (and I had a $15 rebate), I decided to go for it.</li>
            <li> you get use to the larger brush head, it does a noticeable better job deep cleaning your gums and all.  </li>
            <li> The quadrant notification is definitely helpful in making sure you are hitting each part of the mouth equally.  </li>
            <li> I upgraded from an older oral-b model.</li>
            <li> This one is more sophisticated than my last one and the brush actually stops and beeps briefly after the 30 second brushing interval for each quadrant.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush also has several settings for personal care and more.</li>
            <li> My main area of need is avoiding gingivitis.  </li>
            <li> Definitely a must buy, I can never go back to those cheap drug store brushes ever again!</li>
            <li> I have the older version of this</li>
            <li> Replaced an older model that I had for years!&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hoping that&#x27;s just because of the larger brush head that causes me to open my mouth farther and that it will pass as I become more accustomed to it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> - It&#x27;s become the main unit</li>
            <li> and I travel with the older one.</li>
            <li> I bought the product mainly for the pressure sensor</li>
            <li> Needed to place me older model do to the fact it</li>
            <li> It replaced a much older Oral B cordless tooth brush.  </li>
            <li> main concern it seems is to get my birthdate before I can proceed with my question...  </li>
            <li> This toothbrush replaced an older model that was dropped and stopped working.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty easily motivated by getting &#x27;gold stars&#x27; and seeing the little face get &#x27;happier&#x27; when I brush longer.  </li>
            <li> available modes include settings for sensitive teeth, deep cleaning, whitening and just a normal mode for schlubs like me.</li>
            <li> This is a user friendly electric toothbrush that is helpful to people, like myself, who don&#x27;t brush their teeth as long as they should.</li>
            <li> Gives you all of the good and no wasted expense on stuff of no value to your tooth health (again, in my humble opinion).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would say the Oral-B brand of brushes are far superior to any other regardless of the hype (I&#x27;ve used the other brands on &#x27;test&#x27; drives and just really prefer the cleaning action of these babies, but again, I&#x27;m a 20 yr plus oral-B</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend over Sonicare.</li>

            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> So, If you want to stay out of the dentists chair My wife and I Highly recommend an Oral-B</li>
            <li> It feels substantial and of high quality.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this Oral-B.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended,</li>
            <li> I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> it were my own money, would I buy the Oral B Professional 5000, or consider the [[ASIN:B003UKKHB4 Oral-B Professional 3000]] which has the same basic features but with fewer bells and whistles?</li>
            <li> I like the smart guide timers with this brand which my old Oral-B had too.</li>
            <li> As you change modes by pressing a button on the toothbrush the smart guide shows an icon representing the mode; for instance a feather represents the sensitive mode and a diamond the whitening</li>
            <li> every 30 seconds to indicate when the recommended two minute brushing time is complete and the SmartGuide has a large quadrant icon showing the stages of brushing.</li>
            <li> The floss action brush head seems a little large, okay</li>
            <li> New handle feels better than previous model.  </li>
            <li> It has that little screen, that improves your cleaning experience. :)</li>
            <li> This is much more heavy duty than the older model.</li>
            <li> The Floss Action brush heads haven&#x27;t changed , but I do like the selection of 5 cleaning modes (regular clean, deep clean, sensitive, whitening, and massage).  </li>
            <li> However, I would not be willing to pay extra for the Smart Guide for an adult.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The timer is a smart innovation to help maintain a consistent standard of brushing.  </li>
            <li> LCD display that comes with the unit is a little overkill, but as some people said, it&#x27;s a good way to let you know how long you need to brush.&lt;br</li>
            <li> And even if I over brush or brush too hard or whatever, I don&#x27;t ever want a toothbrush that cuts off on its own again.  </li>
            <li> Some pastes create a lot more liquid than others while brushing, and you may find it tough to go a full 2 minutes without taking a break to spit it out.  </li>
            <li> Some pastes create a lot more liquid than others while brushing, and you may find it tough to go a full 2 minutes without taking a break to spit it out.  </li>
            <li> someone who travels frequently, I also really like that this unit came with a case for the toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I had tried all sorts of implements to clean the older units, and nothing could get at the scum and effectively clean it.</li>
            <li> It really feels like i&#x27;ve had a professional cleaning</li>
            <li> So far I really like this toothbrush</li>
            <li> Now I grasp why it felt sensitive so much of the time:  </li>
            <li> If you have sensitive gums then you should purchase the 5000 because there is a gentle mode.  </li>
            <li> It has one detraction for me in that it is much louder than my old cybersonic.  </li>
            <li> Has a few more features, like longer brushing etc...</li>
            <li> In a few days, I can tell my teeth and gums show improvement from better cleaning.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended this brush and I love it, especially the timer that keeps me disciplined about where to brush and for how long.  </li>
            <li> This toothbrush is so powerful that within 2 weeks of starting to use it I lost a 3 surface onlay that had been in my mouth since 1997.  </li>
            <li> My husband normally hates power toothbrushes</li>
            <li> I sometimes have trouble gripping it.  </li>
            <li> My dentist says my mouth is in the top 5 he looks into and was #2 until a few years ago when I reached my 60&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth the extra $$$!</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend this product, worth the money.</li>
            <li> As my hygenist suggested, my teeth got somewhat more used to the vibration after using it for a few weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This toothbrush does a lot of extra stuff but its worth it all for your health.</li>
            <li> The SmartGuideA is a useful tool that adds to the overall experience.</li>
            <li> motor is powerful, especially when fully charged.</li>
            <li> At last I feel as though I am having fun while I am thoroughly cleaning my teeth</li>
            <li> normal, scrotum scrub, etc.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m constantly using the toothbrush throughout the day but the battery remains useful for about 4-5 days before I need to put it on the charger.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned a number of electric toothbrushes and the only two brands that are worth anything are Oral-B and Phillips.  </li>
            <li> I am glad that I made the switch to Oral B with this model which I admit is not cheap by all means.</li>
            <li> you own this unit and read the owner manual you realize the unit can be further customized to your personal liking by buying a different replacement head.</li>
            <li> Smart Guide itself was pretty easy to program, and it syncs up with the actual brush to display the amount of pressure you&#x27;re using, the mode (regular brushing, deep cleaning, etc.), and the number of seconds you&#x27;re spending on each of the four quadrants of your mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Many people get these super results in as little as two or three weeks when they start using the brush following a through professional treatment</li>
            <li> I stayed with same brand name, Oral B,  out of brand loyalty and I am pleased with all the new bells and whistles far different from my ancient electric tooth.  </li>
            <li> Also, it vibrated the most per second, not sure how much this matters, but I felt like I got the right one.</li>
            <li> No hard sell-just there to pique</li>
            <li> With no less than five settings on the toothbrush itself and a wireless timer that tells you exactly how long to spend brushing the four quadrants of your mouth, I&#x27;d say that this is a product worth recommending just on the strength of those features alone.</li>
            <li> There was a significant reduction in plaque after using just the normal mode and the deep cleaning mode came real close to that &amp;#34;just back from the dentist&amp;#34; feel.</li>
            <li> Since I am rotating this toothbrush with my older Triumph which is still going strong, this means that the battery would have lasted less than 1 year if I am using this toothbrush exclusively.    </li>
            <li> It also allows multiple members of the family to share the brush easily by putting a different head in for each family member.  </li>
            <li> so it can be less vigorous for more sensitive people</li>
            <li> only two complaints that I have about this purchase is that it did only come with one toothbrush, but I found other multi-pack brushes on Amazon for a good price.  </li>
            <li> I does a better job than lower priced electric toothbrushes due to a sonic action that aids the mechanical action in cleaning your teeth&lt;</li>
            <li> mouth / lower left bottom of mouth / and lower right bottom of mouth.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> I have had it for a little over 2 weeks and have never had a better clean and the size of the head along with the oscillating action ensures better tartar and plaque removal, especially in those hard to reach areas.  </li>
            <li> the first cleaning, I could tell a big difference compared to a manual toothbrush (which I had been using because my older one broke.)  </li>
            <li> enjoy using this product, and it appears to be extremely well made.  </li>
            <li> Is that the little clock / timer doesn&#x27;t have a way for it to stand on its own, they want you to stick it to the wall with double sided tape.</li>
            <li> I did not buy it originally because I was not sure it was the right tooth brush.</li>
            <li> When it was brand new, the battery lasted ~10 days as advertised.  </li>
            <li> The new version the rubber seems to be built into the handle.</li>
            <li> We like our new toothbrush a lot.  </li>
            <li> The new toothbrush has lights on the handle that you can see out of the corner of your eye and in the mirror.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m shopping for a new one now.</li>
            <li> It was time for a new one, so we got this -</li>
            <li> However, allthough I live in Singapore the propduct did not include Singaporean charger.</li>
            <li> * pause when going to a new mouth quadrant.</li>
            <li> I needed a new one and this meets my needs and exceed expectations.  </li>
            <li> As I live overseas, this is a problem.</li>
            <li> I do like this new toothbrush from Oral-B.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The new charger design is smarter, allowing for easier cleaning.</li>
            <li> the bells and whistle&#x27;s that the new one has</li>
            <li> I had to buy a new electric toothbrush when my Sonicare was lost at a hotel.  </li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ve bought new one.</li>
            <li> New one has some improvements</li>
            <li> new Precision 5000 has an updated SmartGuide that uses stars to indicate which quadrant you&#x27;re brushing (or supposed to be brushing) along with a smiley face that is always on with the clock.</li>
            <li> The Precision 5000 itself has a new look.</li>
            <li> If you have a SmartSeries 5000, you probably don&#x27;t need to upgrade to the new Precision 5000.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve been using it for almost a year, and it&#x27;s still working as new.</li>
            <li> The 1000 does not have a display but it does beep to notify you when to move to a new area.&lt;br /&gt;- Stained teeth.  </li>
            <li> From the performance, I guess my dentist will be asking what new is happening to my mouth.  </li>
            <li> and it is time to move on to a new quarter of your teeth.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There is a new design to the stand which keeps it plugged into the charger.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There is a new travel case which we appreciate since we do travel with our electric toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There is a new travel case which we appreciate since we do travel with our electric toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> but it didn&#x27;t include the latest brush from Phillips), so it really comes down to personal preference.  </li>
            <li> There is an easy to see red warning light to let you know when you&#x27;re brushing too hard.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;While the older models already have the essentials, this new brush clearly improves upon them.</li>
            <li> The 5000 have a few more modes, such as deep clean (just a longer cycle), and for massaging the gums.</li>
            <li> For worse the traveling case is so huge you shouldn&#x27;t expect to fit in a toiletry bag.</li>
            <li> So far I really like this thing and the default floss action head.</li>
            <li> Well, after one day of working, all of a sudden, my toothbrush had issues when the red led light will not go off.  </li>
            <li> This one will display a red light when the charge is getting low.</li>
            <li> But the main point seems to be to apply ultrasonic cleaning to your teeth, like your jeweler uses on old jewelry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I replaced a four year old unit only because I wanted the easy to switch out heads and the ability to use various brush styles.</li>
            <li> , much easier to get to the 2 minute mark, especially for people like me that have too much to do.  </li>
            <li> Did research on several different models and this one seemed to fit my needs.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think I would use the digital time counter, but after I used it a few times I actually liked it.</li>
            <li> and I can really get in there to the back teeth and really feel like I cleaned my mouth sufficiently, but it takes forever to charge and my battery is already going out</li>
            <li> I really enjoy the beep/brief pause at each 30 second interval that signifies for you to move to the next quarter of your mouth, as well as the timer.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had other electric brushes before and those they get the job done, I always liked the small powerful heads on the Oral-B ones.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this electric toothbrush with the caveat that it requires frequent head replacements.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;We would highly recommend the Oral-B Professional 5000.</li>
            <li> Bought as a replacement same brand and is very pleased with the upgrades old model was 6+ yrs old and used everyday by 2 adults</li>
            <li> In any case, the absence of drilling and scraping since Oral-B Professional products came in to my life makes this one of those rare unintentionally life-changing products.</li>
            <li> But for the first time, the new charger ONLY works in the US.  </li>
            <li> I like the fact that is does a great job of removing tartar from teeth but even on sensitive mode and regular brush head it still is tough on my gums and sides of cheeks.</li>
            <li> Super fun to use, no problems at all in the past</li>
            <li> It would be better if it had a small backlight though.  </li>
            <li> first time I used the toothbrush I noticed such a difference in the cleanliness of my teeth!  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have dual voltage that is necessary if you travel to most foreign countries, like the one I had before.</li>
            <li> After using my toothbrush for 1.5 years it stopped working, but Braun offers a 2 year warranty for this product!</li>
            <li> This was recommended by my husband who had used one for several years.... since it was first introduced on the market.  </li>
            <li> My first Oral-B finally reached the end of the road after 4.5 years and I had to get another one.</li>
            <li> My dentist actually gave me one of these with my first periodontal visit.</li>
            <li> my Oral-B. It&#x27;s like getting a professional cleaning every time I brush!</li>
            <li> After the first use of this I actually felt like I had visited the dentist because of the cleanliness feeling.</li>
            <li> My original Oral-B40 just recently died after 20 years of daily use by two people (crack at brushhead attachment, still works though)</li>
            <li> you are lazy, this toothbrush seems to do more of the work for you.  </li>
            <li> I miss my old brush!</li>
            <li> The adjunct display would seem to be superfluous at first, but it does focus one&#x27;s attention on thoroughly finishing each quadrant before moving on to the next.  </li>
            <li> So far, whew!  </li>
            <li> most other models only indicate if the battery needs to be charged (like immediately!).</li>
            <li> Last it has 5 modes, one of the reasons I bought it at first.</li>
            <li> The digital display is not really needed, but it is pretty cool to see the countdown....</li>
            <li> Thank you for that, but I&#x27;m only going to change my rating from a 2-star to a 4-star as this should not have happened in the first place.</li>
            <li> But I travel around the world for work, usually for weeks at a time, I would not be able to charge it.</li>
            <li> Purchased the original years ago, it lasted about 2-3 years before needing to be replaced due to being dropped (urgh).</li>
            <li> The engineer that came up with this concept should be slapped silly, in my honest opinion!  </li>
            <li> The engineer that came up with this concept should be slapped silly, in my honest opinion!  </li>
            <li> also you have different cleaning modes and it really brushes your teeth!</li>
            <li> I love that if I have a lazy day and don&#x27;t want to floss, after using this tooth brush, Its as if I flossed any way.</li>
            <li> This is my second Braun electric toothbrush (the first was not this model but a cheaper model I bought about 6 years ago)</li>
            <li> We expected a 5 day life out of a full charge.</li>
            <li> With this toothbrush, I can keep one eye on the little clock and it makes the time go by very quickly.</li>
            <li> The extra screen is a nice little gimmick to let you know how much time you have brushed your teeth.  </li>
            <li> I have a basic level Oral-B electric toothbrush and while it performed well it didn&#x27;t offer me much comfort with my main concern of receding gumlines.</li>
            <li> You could always start the 4000 cycle again if you want an equal to the deep clean mode</li>
            <li> teeth have never felt this clean before (other than leaving the dentists office.)  </li>
            <li> You also get a slick little LCD clock with a happy face that smiles when you&#x27;re brushing correctly, and frowns when you&#x27;re grinding the enamel off your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> While it does make my teeth whiter and clean, I stopped using it due to the fact that it irritates my teeth when using it.</li>
            <li> When the head is still new and fibers stiff and straight, the toothbrush does something special on teeth.  </li>
            <li> It cleans just as well as the old one and with this new one I do have a choice of speeds (which I didn&#x27;t have before).</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s a substantial improvement over the old Triumph, which didn&#x27;t perform that well even when new.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been an Oral-B fan for a while now, and I was eager to try out this new Precision 5000 after my old Oral-B&#x27;s power button gave up the ghost.</li>
            <li> But if you need a new electric toothbrush, I recommend the Oral-B Professional 5000.</li>
            <li> Well I was surprised to find upon first use that my teeth felt slick and clean, like they do after a dentist cleaning.</li>
            <li> I purchased a soft brush head and use it on regular speed with no ill effects.  </li>
            <li> I think it took about 2 days to charge the first time, but now it usually gets a full charge overnight.  </li>
            <li> My mouth feels very clean after every use, with very little effort.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews and was a little hesitant but was pleasantly surprised at how easy set up was without reading directions.&lt;br</li>
            <li> new SmartGuide is much better, with a hard pause between the 30-second intervals.</li>
            <li> I also like being able to dial down to a \\&quot;soft\\&quot; setting occasionally.</li>
            <li> Except for the second generation, there are positive improvements in each generation of the product.  </li>
            <li> You can set different settings (times), but regardless of the one chosen, you can always see exactly how much time you actually brushed.  </li>
            <li> New one has a hole that sits on a spike (missing in the original one) in the new adapter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It starts out giving strong brushing action, but after 2-4 uses, it drops and then it needs recharging again after a few days.</li>
            <li> It still, however, a tad harsh vibration wise although as stated have become slightly acustomed to it.</li>
            <li> As long as the inside of the heads and motion shaft are kept clean after every use the toothbrush has kept looking and acting like new over the duration of use thus far.</li>
            <li> The speed is just right, it displays the usage of the battery and slows down every 30 seconds to show how much time you are brushing your teeth.</li>
            <li> By actually monitoring a full two minutes of brushing and having it divide the time up into 4 equal lengths that I can use to give each quadrant of my mouth equal attention, my mouth is much cleaner and healthier than it was with a cheaper Oral-B toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> At over six bucks apiece, you could buy a whole new Cross Action brush for the cost of one refill head for this.</li>
            <li> The problem was in the packaging, which was fine except the adhesive tape was missing.</li>
            <li> It cleans well, it is easy to use, and holds enough charge to last several days.  </li>
            <li> The new Precision 5000 only came with a single Floss Action head, while my Triumph came with the same Floss Action head, and added a Sensitive head, a Power Tip head, Pro White head, and some kind of tongue cleaner head.  </li>
            <li> Seems large in the back of mine</li>
            <li> especially like the smart guide.</li>
            <li> The moment the toothbrush is turned on an icon on the smart guide shows which cleaning mode is currently being used.</li>
            <li> We feel certain that our&lt;br /&gt;dentist will see a difference on our next visit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is also easy to use a different style or model of brush for different areas of the mouth or different conditions, like you have tender areas or sensitive</li>
            <li> as it prevents the need for the user to keep watching the Smart Guide display (which can sometimes be difficult to see from a distance).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Precision 5000 series toothbrush, like all other Oral-B powered brushes I have used, does a splendid job of cleaning my teeth.  </li>
            <li> Teaching kids to brush, the SmartGuide may have some application, but for my purposes, it is of little more use than as a digital clock.  </li>
            <li> Teaching kids to brush, the SmartGuide may have some application, but for my purposes, it is of little more use than as a digital clock.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been told many times by the dentist that I brush too hard, this remedied that problem.  </li>
            <li> and I love the fact that it tells me when I&#x27;m brushing to hard.  </li>
            <li> At first I thought that this toothbrush, with its separate timer/clock was a little gimmicky, but after using it for several weeks, I&#x27;m very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> I never realized that I brushed too hard and this thing has really gotten me into better brushing habits.  </li>
            <li> Overall if you are trying to decide between the Oral B Professional 5000 and a Sonicare brush I would whole heartedly suggest going with Oral B -</li>
            <li> Also, my old Oral-B brush indicated how much charge was left by an icon on the brush.</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive teeth and going to the dentist</li>
            <li> I use it on a daily basis to keep up with time as I get ready for the day.  </li>
            <li> Feels like I just walked out of the dentist office after having my teeth professionally cleaned.  </li>
            <li> We use the floss action and pro-white brushing heads.  </li>
            <li> I tried getting a replacement directly from Oral B under warranty</li>
            <li> About once a month,  I let the brush run completely out of batteries while running,  </li>
            <li> The old version seemed to glued on.</li>
            <li> I was told to be a responsible consumer and dispose of the battery properly.  </li>
            <li> and is using it with a Floss Action brush head.  </li>
            <li> I bought per my dentist&#x27; recommendation for my sensitive gums.  </li>
            <li> Out of the 5 brush modes, I&#x27;ve used regular (2 min), plus (3 min), and gum (gentle).</li>
            <li> seriously, it&#x27;s loud.</li>
            <li> kinda really loud &amp; noisy.  </li>
            <li> how I feel about the Floss Action Brush head.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s louder than my old one which takes some getting used to.</li>
            <li> My old oral b gave out after 8 years.  </li>
            <li> I was surprised.  </li>
            <li> yourself a favor, ask your dental professional but get started now.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s much easier to buy a set of replacement brush heads for BOTH, than it would be to have a different type for each toothbrush.</li>
            <li> The Floss action brush is awesome.&lt;br /&gt;Don</li>
            <li> It feels like you just had your teeth professionally cleaned each time you use it.</li>
            <li> As far as cleaning, I rate it 5</li>
            <li> ; setting, the floss action head made my gums sore.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had my next dentist check-up yet, so that will be the real test.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have the old low-tech version</li>
            <li> It does not show a whole a lot information, and could be shrunk into a smaller form factor.</li>
            <li> Purchased as a replacement for an old Sonicare.  </li>
            <li> The included display also provides a way of knowing your progress and includes a clock which is definitely helpful when getting ready in the morning.  </li>
            <li> Before this I always overestimated the time and stopped brushing too early</li>
            <li> It feels like you just visited the dentist for a professional cleaning.  </li>
            <li> Wow, does it need to be this loud?  </li>
            <li> I feel like I&#x27;m getting a professional cleaning.  </li>
            <li> I also bought additional Oral-B Sensitive (extra-soft brush heads) for my husband who has sensitive gums.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve completely stopped using my sonicare toothbrush in favor of this one.</li>
            <li> Otherwise you don&#x27;t know how much charge is left.</li>
            <li> but I feel it won&#x27;t last much longer.  </li>
            <li> BUT beware, after just over ONE year the batteries quit completely and are NOT user-replaceable.  </li>
            <li> When my old Sonicare died, I did some research, and found this.</li>
            <li> i was really surprised with the power.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so professional, it&#x27;s unbelieveable.  </li>
            <li> Braun Triumph Professional Care</li>
            <li> On that alone, you&#x27;re doing yourself a favor by using any of the Braun/Oral-B professional series toothbrushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> On the plus side, the Precision 5000 brush actually lights up when you&#x27;re applying too much pressure.</li>
            <li> I really like the timer that keeps you on task to brush all quadrants for total of two minutes.</li>
            <li> I can really feel the difference and hopefully on my next dentist visit</li>
            <li> I am an engineer, so her giving up and my finally fixing whatever is not an unusual situation.  </li>
            <li> 12 yr old doesn&#x27;t complain about brushing teeth</li>
            <li> After 2+ years of keeping my teeth completely cavity-free, I think this toothbrush deserves a review at least.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My teeth feel like I had a professional cleaning every day.</li>
            <li> I received a  dental professional version of this toothbrush in dentral school.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It feels gentler in your mouth than the Oral B and on sensitive teeth</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always wanted an aggressive, efficient and sensitive electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> But darn it if the competition of getting four stars and a smiley face, don&#x27;t ensure that I push through a complete two-minute brushing each and every time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This is a professional tooth brush.</li>
            <li> The floss action does not replace the need to floss</li>
            <li> Toss out your old electric and manual brushes.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive teeth</li>
            <li> Also OralB has sensitive heads if I need them which I haven&#x27;t so far.  </li>
            <li> They must have used a battery recycled from an early 90s</li>
            <li> different brushing modes - polish, gentle, whitening,</li>
            <li> no cavities for this 40 year old.</li>
            <li> It took 1-2 weeks to get used to the floss action of the brush head.</li>
            <li> Floss Action Precision 5000 Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush</li>
            <li> /&gt;There&#x27;s still no way to set it to default to sensitive mode.</li>
            <li> I always use the sensitive mode.  </li>
            <li> To get to sensitive mode, you press the power button once and the mode change button twice.</li>
            <li> Wow.</li>
            <li> I ended up choosing the Oral-B 4000 (after trying the nearly identical 5000) and my wife prefers the Phillips Diamond Clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you have a sensitive mouth or are prone to headaches, this probably isn&#x27;t for you.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say I have a lot of use for the accessories (though I am thankful for the addition of a hard-plastic travel case) such as the \\&quot;SmartGuide,\\&quot; which really seems to be designed for parents of toddlers who are teaching their kids how to use a toothbrush.  </li>

            <li> I prefer the old method where you can see the charge level at all</li>
            <li> I prefer the Floss Action, but my wife uses the Sensitive</li>

            <li> dentist has seen improvement with these toothbrushes vs. the old SonicCare</li>
            <li> the Oral-B Professional and</li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;m the one singing the praises of the Oral-B Professional to my friends, relatives, and acquaintances.  .</li>
            <li> you don&#x27;t have sensitive teeth</li>
            <li> I decided to switch from the old fashion way of brushing your teeth</li>
            <li> I wonder why.&lt;br /&gt;I assume that Floss Action Precision 5000 does not work for cleaning.</li>
            <li> Zero problems with it so far.</li>
            <li> It cleans some spots much easier than a traditional or Sonicare brush.  </li>
            <li> The floss action tip that comes with the product takes getting used to.  </li>
            <li> I was tempted to upgrade to this model for some time, but was worried the rapid aggressive rotation would harm my sensitive gums.  </li>
            <li> he thought the Professional 5000 would give us more&lt;br /&gt;cleaning and flossing action.  </li>
            <li> that professional cleaning.  </li>
            <li> bought the Professional 5000 for his Christmas&lt;</li>
            <li> , it went directly into use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My old Triumph handle had an LCD display, to show battery level and charging status.  </li>
            <li> Floss Action Precision 5000 Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush]]</li>
            <li> Floss Action Precision 5000 Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush]]</li>
            <li> I would recommend using the sensitive mode until your get use to the brush.</li>
            <li> Overall, I really like it</li>
            <li> The old one that I have still works to this day.</li>
            <li> I feel like I&#x27;ve been to the dentist for a professional cleaning.</li>
            <li> , I read the reviews of the Oral-B Professional 5000 and decided to try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It is clunkier looking than the Philips, and noisier, but I really don&#x27;t need quiet while I brush my teeth anyway</li>
            <li> If you want simple practicality (really do I need to plug my toothbrush charger into a USB port?)</li>
            <li> My teeth are now much cleaner than while I was using a regular toothbrush</li>
            <li> Additionally, I would not recommend purchasing the floss action heads if you have sensitive</li>
            <li> /&gt;While I recommend the Oral B 5000, I would suggest using the 1000 if you do not have sensitive or stained teeth.  </li>
            <li> So then I went to pull the mount off the wall and throw it out, and that had already set in 10 minutes and nearly pulled the paint off the wall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product has flossing action.  </li>
            <li> I just bought this toothbrush and so far I like it.</li>
            <li> For one thing, silly as it sounds, I&#x27;m motivated by the happy face that appears on the clock when i complete the two minutes and remains there until the next time I brush.</li>
            <li> I am switching out the brush heads for the sensitive teeth brush heads.</li>
            <li> Also, I like that the battery lasts pretty long.</li>
            <li> so really you only need 1 toothbrush and 4 brush heads.  </li>
            <li> This review was also updated on 9/07/12 after comparing it to the Oral-B Smartseries 5000 Professional Care model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;This model comes with the FLOSS ACTION head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The mode for floss action requires the use of the floss action head which is what comes with this model.</li>
            <li> It can be very tempting to skimp out on the amount of time dedicated to brushing, especially when rushing in the morning, but this system helps fight those temptations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had to replace my old oral b electric toothbrush after 15 years.  </li>
            <li> (so it&#x27;s over 5 years old)</li>
            <li> (you&#x27;d be surprised how many health issues are related to unhealthy teeth and gums) and smile.</li>
            <li> remote clock and timer is surprisingly useful.  </li>
            <li> The digital timer is ok, but not really an important feature to me.</li>
            <li> Replacement heads are expensive but worth the price of healthy teeth and fewer dentists visits.</li>
            <li> By now, the first unit barely holds the charge for 1 brushing, the second unit for a week, with 1 person using it.</li>
            <li> did find the pressure warning useful to start, as I was brushing my teeth harder than the toothbrush wanted.</li>
            <li> It is worth every penny spent</li>
            <li> I had to do trial and error with a few different brands to see which one I liked (Colgate Total seems to work</li>
            <li> I had to do trial and error with a few different brands to see which one I liked (Colgate Total seems to work</li>
            <li> I like the round heads a lot better than regular toothbrush heads like sonicare.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a similar toothbrush for years and didn&#x27;t always brush the full two minutes because it seemed so long.</li>
            <li> in all, a good electric toothbrush set that you can&#x27;t go wrong with.</li>
            <li> Then again, considering the substantially lower cost of this new Precision 5000 model, compared to my high priced Triumph 9900 from 5 or more years ago, I guess I can see why they left out a few of the extra frills.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve been too cheap and lazy to buy a new one.</li>
            <li> The four sections represented are the upper left, upper right, lower left and lower right sides of your mouth.  </li>
            <li> as the right tool for the job.rants in your mouth, and that the physical feedback eliminates the need to watch the LCD display for visual indicators, I don&#x27;t appreciate the interruption in the brushing motion.  </li>
            <li> The pressure can be greater with no detection, or much less than too much and the tooth brush shuts down.  </li>
            <li> Only one really: the power runs down quite quickly (admittedly, my wife and I both use this brush) but it then takes FOR - E - VER to recharge.</li>
            <li> There are different modes (deep clean, sensitive, massage), but the standard mode works just as well.  </li>
            <li> That the deep clean mode is &#x27;only&#x27; brushing for extra time seems a cheat too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The clock/timer gives immediate easy to understand feedback even a small child could understand.</li>
            <li> It takes only a short period of time to see and feel the difference in your teeth and how clean your entire mouth feels.  </li>
            <li> I have used them all and use them all regularly except for the deep cleaning mode which is basically an extended daily clean mode.</li>
            <li> The basic speed for a daily clean seems to be the same.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The unit has five brushing modes to choose from (Daily Clean, Deep Clean, Sensitive, Whitening, and Massage) and even tells you when you&#x27;re brushing too hard.  </li>
            <li> You will be hooked from the start and with five different cleaning modes; daily ( recommended two-minute cleaning: 30 seconds per quadrum ), deep ( three minutes: 45 seconds per quadrum), sensitive, polishing and message,along with a variety of brush heads there is a sweet spot for just about everyone.</li>
            <li> In particular, this timer offers some confidence to parents whose kids are gradually moving toward fully independent brushing.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There are multiple options, the wireless smart guide is cool, works as a small time piece as well in the bathroom and shows the current mode and amount of time to brush each quadrant, not a necessary piece but a useful gadget to have.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t need &amp;#34;fancy shmancy,&amp;#34; get the next lower priced one that operates exactly the same so far as rotation goes.</li>
            <li> thought the Oral-B toothbrush would arrive with the full assortment of brush heads, but it only arrived with one brush head (unlike the Philips which had a larger and a smaller brush head).  </li>
            <li> Other than that, birds sing, plants grow, babies smile when you use this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> The kids feel that it brushes faster and more firmly than the other model and since they use a copy of the older model when they visit their father I think it isn&#x27;t just wishful thinking.</li>
            <li> The round head is bulky in my small mouth and I have a difficult time reaching all the spots I need to in order to ensure the perfect clean.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a replacement for an older model with the actual battery level display.</li>
            <li> After that first brushing I was left with the same feeling I get when I leave my dentists</li>
            <li> I was iffy on this particular design because the head is so much smaller.</li>
            <li> It also isn&#x27;t balanced correctly for a small hand and thus holding it isn&#x27;t that comfortable or natural.</li>
            <li> and I think I paid the same as I did for the older one a couple of years</li>
            <li> I personally have an older version, but just bought one for each of my Mom and sister.  </li>
            <li> I replaced an older Oral-B unit that I had used for several years.</li>
            <li> This classic Braun Oral-B is second to none...</li>
            <li> I recently purchased the Oral-B Precision 5000 to replace an older model Oral-B electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Summary: If you have a big hand, big mouth, and don&#x27;t mind waiting for it to fully charge (over 12 hours), then this is for you ;)  </li>
            <li> When my original Oral B 5000 broke (due to me dropping it several times)</li>
            <li> From past esperience I know that it gets your teeth cleaner which helps to equal a better check up at the dentist.  </li>
            <li> far as quality of brushing, this is exactly what I expected from Oral B.</li>
            <li> Unlike other products, the nearest service center is more than a 10-drive and they advised I needed to ship my entire brush with accessories to Massachusetts (I live in VA).  </li>
            <li> My teeth have never felt this clean on a daily basis with any other brush, manual or electric.</li>
            <li> I did everything right as I used to fill out mail-in-rebate form for other people when I was doing retail.</li>
            <li> Then, after having a cavity filled after a checkup only 2 weeks earlier, my dentist noted surprise at build up in the short time since she had last seen me.</li>
            <li> It is constructed of high quality materials and has a durable, solid feel to it.</li>
            <li> Failing that, I may have to go back to the old faithful Vitality and just use the new brush head and put up with recharging ever 3-4 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They sell 6 different brush heads in all, one is for sensitive teeth which is new.</li>
            <li> If you are making the transition from a manual and/or less powerful battery operated brush you may want to consider purchasing some of the sensitive replacement heads to start with.  </li>
            <li> If you are using too much pressure, a red light appears on both the brush and the guide display -- I found that I was brushing hard way too often</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t hurt to have a couple additional packs sent when they&#x27;re cheaper than usual, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Going back to welcome design changes, Oral-B has got away from the massive Braun plug that they used on previous models (and still use on Braun shavers) and instead uses a normal North American plug.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The main reason I went for a new one was that the battery was only lasting 3-4 days after a charge</li>
            <li> /&gt;It provides a real reality check on how long you should be brushing your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so you can go on brushing as long as you like without restarting a whole cycle.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The majority of the ones I own have been Oral-B mostly because they have been the least expensive on the market but all of them have been compatible with the brush heads.  </li>
            <li> After he got home and used for first time, he called me to grill just how much I spent as I am on a strict budget.</li>
            <li> first difference is the addition of the remote receiver.</li>
            <li> The SmartGuide works as a normal digital clock for your bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> (you&#x27;d be surprised how many health issues are related to unhealthy teeth and gums) and smile.from (Daily Clean, Deep Clean, Sensitive, Whitening, and Massage) and even tells you when you&#x27;re brushing too hard.  </li>
            <li> I noticed less plaque after first use!</li>
            <li> The back cover for the smart clean receiver was hard to get off.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had much success with the display unit, it seemed to never turn off and was always counting down.</li>
            <li> the Smart Guide can actually be helpful in giving feedback to encourage proper brushing.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t a big deal to me, but may provide positive reinforcement for those who find it hard to go the full 2 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The shape of the Sonicare brush head is way better to reach in the back and on the sides of those hard to reach area.</li>
            <li> My favorite features are when it lights up when you brush too hard, and the *very brief</li>
            <li> It was clear in the product information that both the round and flat brush heads fit.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Another thing I like is that when you press too hard is does not pause like the older one did, it just has a red light to let you know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After replacing it 3 different times over the years because it wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge, I decided I would try a new product and purchased the Oral-B.  </li>
            <li> Now that I say that.....being a new user, the accessory actually did help me get started.</li>
            <li> If mine goes tits up tomorrow, I with be picking up a new one by mid morning.</li>
            <li> The Triumph series would do a brief pause in between quadrants (you&#x27;re supposed to spend 30 seconds in each quadrant of your mouth), where the new Precision series stops and chirps like</li>
            <li> Please consider this toothbrush the next time you need to get a new one.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The new 5000 also uses an audible beep every 30 seconds along with Oral B&#x27;s traditional pause.</li>
            <li> With the new version, the display is gone, and has been replaced by LED lights (in 3 different increments).  </li>
            <li> my account, the entire unit to Quebec (I live in Vancouver, BC).</li>
            <li> (This is a new charger design than the former 5000 series model had, that one could be used in Europe.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It sounds great to have all these options, but from the toothbrush itself it is impossible to know what mode you are in.  </li>
            <li> My teeth feel quite incredibly clean after using it, and during my last dentist visit they remarked that I had a lot less plaque than usual.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I spend 1 whole day charging it up and only get to use the toothbrush for 2 days before the battery is totally discharged.  </li>
            <li> charger takes about 12 hours to fully charge, so every two weeks or whenever the brush indicator shows a battery charge needed, I set the brush on the charger over the day or over night and it is ready to go when needed.&lt;br/&gt;Current research in dental and medical literature shows a correlation to gum disease and overall health.  </li>
            <li> They are only supposed to last for 10 years, and I got 15, so I couldn&#x27;t really complain.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive teeth and thought I would need to use the sensitive setting on a regular basis.</li>
            <li> It follows and guides your brushing, and while the effect is only psychological, it really makes a difference.</li>
            <li> My teeth don&#x27;t look whiter or anything, but I know exactly how long I&#x27;ve brushed my teeth!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a child but brushing with a regular toothbrush never resulted in all my teeth getting cleaned, so the audio and visual aids in brushing really do the trick for me.</li>
            <li> The remote timer thing is just an over the top unneccessary piece of glam, in my humble opinion.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t need a count-down (or count-up, depending on your taste) timer to know when I&#x27;ve brushed my teeth enough.  </li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t need a count-down (or count-up, depending on your taste) timer to know when I&#x27;ve brushed my teeth enough.  </li>
            <li> You are even presented with a big smiley face, to give you that extra sense of pride in what you have accomplished.  </li>
            <li> I had gingivitis and it has reversed it quickly after just a few weeks of using this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> The travel case fit nicely in my carry-on suitcase holding 2 brush heads and the base.</li>
            <li> Have used the 5000 for a month and find the cleaning action is more robust than ever without irritating my gums.</li>
            <li> After finally charging, I was already skeptical but wanted to give the Oral-B a chance at working as good as my Sonicare...  </li>
            <li> Essentially, the secondary button&#x27;s physical location makes it very easy to press accidentally.  </li>
            <li> then I started noticing the red light that would light up when it senses you&#x27;re brushing too hard, lighting up even when I&#x27;m applying little pressure.&lt;br /&gt;Then</li>
            <li> /&gt;Unboxing the new product, and now after using it for the past month, I can honestly say that it is extremely similar to my previous Triumph model Oral-B device.  </li>
            <li> As far as the smart guide, I concur with some of the other reviewers.  </li>
            <li> It removes plaque like no other.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used the normal and sensitive settings but both work well and are noticeably different.</li>
            <li> /&gt;just combine it with Crest 3D white Luxe advance vivid</li>
            <li> I mean, come one, who keeps a toothbrush instruction manual within easy reach???  </li>
            <li> As someone who has used a traditional toothbrush for her entire life, I was astounded at how much cleaner my entire mouth felt after using the Oral B Professional toothbrush.</li>
            <li> in brief, a great product but a disappointment as I&#x27;m not enjoying the full experience.</li>
            <li> While I loved that old model, my one complaint was that the battery didn&#x27;t hold a very sizable charge, and with age it just got worse -- at the time of my replacing it, it was only holding enough charge for about 2 brushings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enter the new Oral-B Smartseries 5000 Professional Care Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush....</li>
            <li> So, after the first thirty seconds you get a very short pause, with a single beep.  </li>
            <li> So, after the first thirty seconds you get a very short pause, with a single beep.  </li>
            <li> I usually blow off the smart guide and brush all over for over 3 minutes, the smart guide made me go over it all again.</li>
            <li> After just two weeks my gums showed significant improvement, as well as, whatever showed such improvement between my teeth and the stains from drinking tea and coffee everyday-</li>
            <li> I live in New York but the nearest service center is in Watertown, MA.  </li>
            <li> i like that the small head is able to get behind my back molars easily.</li>
            <li> The little smiley face on the timer is fun and the brush beeps after 30 seconds or 45, depending on what brushing cycle you chose, then after your brushing time is up</li>
            <li> This little toothbrush is worth its price.  </li>
            <li> and they probably were a little upset that I was having success.  </li>
            <li> Anyways after a few months of my teeth not feeling clean enough I decided to go ahead and buy this.</li>
            <li> also shows the current brushing program (which is another addition), and the current time, bu the main attraction is getting the smiley face on it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought his to replace an older model Braun OralB Plaque Remover 3D that I got back in 2001 which finally gave up the ghost.</li>
            <li> Oral B now requires you to do an extra press of the mode button to get into the sensitive/feather mode (2 total) versus 1 with the older 5000.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall:</li>
            <li> Without the external Smart Guide, there is no way to tell how long have you been brushing your teeth.  </li>
            <li> The Smart Guide allows the brush to pause every 30 seconds per quadrant to ensure that I brush long enough.  </li>
            <li> I had no idea that I was brushing too hard, so the warning light is great.&lt;br</li>
            <li> brush has a warning light if you push too hard on your teeth, which is useful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Aside from the fairly large handle the unit is pretty solid but without excessive weight.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really not that big of a deal to me because I store my toothbrush on the dock anyway, so I just have to plug it in a little more often.  </li>
            <li> In any case, the absence of drilling and scraping since Oral-B Professional products came in to my life makes this one of those rare unintentionally life-changing products.n changes, Oral-B has got away from the massive Braun plug that they used on previous models (and still use on Braun shavers) and instead uses a normal North American plug.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I suspect many people out there would benefit from it instructing them in how long they should brush each quadrant and the alert if one is brushing too hard.</li>
            <li> On top of that is bigger and heavier than other models and hence less practical.</li>
            <li> The timer is nice feature, as well as the indicator that shows if you are pressing down too hard.  </li>
            <li> I had a slightly older model (can&#x27;t remember which) that I was replacing because it did not hold a charge very long anymore.</li>
            <li> Upon delivery of the new item I noticed that the Smart Guide LED display/clock was missing.</li>
            <li> The product has a primary button that turns the unit on/off, and a secondary button that causes it to jump from mouth-zone to mouth-zone.  </li>
            <li> Just get one and use it for life, your teeth and general health will thank you.</li>
            <li> I have a small mouth and this brush is comfortable for brushing even the back teeth.</li>
            <li> Very simply to use, controls an indicators are clear.</li>
            <li> Capitalism at it&#x27;s finest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product itself is sound, but just be aware that you&#x27;re purchasing something with a battery that will eventually fail.</li>
            <li> /&gt; As far as  complaints of the batteries not lasting long:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The Professional line has various toothbrush options for just about any of your oral hygiene needs.  </li>
            <li> After the 3 years, it only lasts for 2 uses before completely dying.  </li>
            <li> Gee, I just realized that my old 1,000 series had a deep cleaning mode, too.</li>
            <li> All three are designed for different conditions, I suggest visiting your health professional and trying out the choices.  </li>
            <li> B00240XRUY Oral-B Cross Action Power Toothbrush]]</li>
            <li> course it is louder than a manual brush, but it is quieter than the Cross Action.</li>
            <li> Cross Action buzzes your teeth as it cleans.</li>
            <li> When I recently purchased this Oral-B Professional toothbrush, I had no idea</li>
            <li> but apparently I made a mistake.</li>
            <li> The mechanical action Oral B uses is very different from Sonicare.</li>
            <li> It was FINALLY time to replace our old one.  </li>
            <li> teeth are also somewhat sensitive, so I have avoided electric toothbrushes until recently, when I tried a Sonicare.  </li>
            <li> , there are additional options, for deep cleaning, sensitive teeth, etc.</li>
            <li> There were several times when my old toothbrush would accidentally be activated in my bag and the battery would run out.</li>
            <li> The Oral B Professional, makes your teeth feel like you just left the dentist.</li>
            <li> This was a replacement for a 10 year old ORAL B similar style</li>
            <li> (I have both) are the same for cleaning action.</li>
            <li> 2+ minute brushings before the power is very low and the brush action is dramatically weaker.  </li>
            <li> toothbrush is easy to clean and  the base does not take up much space.  </li>
            <li> The only complain I have is when you reach 2 minutes it stops completely for about 1 or 2 seconds and then starts again.</li>
            <li> The light is green when charged, and flashes red when the battery is low.  </li>
            <li> But the whirling brush does splatter toothpaste around if you are not careful.</li>
            <li> No regrets with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I even purchased my kids the Oral-B 3d White Action Rechargeable Toothbrush.</li>
            <li> It is kind of expensive though</li>
            <li> I put two fresh alkaline batteries in the monitor when I received it in June of lastyear, and this week they are dead.</li>
            <li> I was delighted when I found that I could remove the charger from the stand which seems to me to be a counter space waster and awkward to use.</li>
            <li> I am telling you, it is like the most irritating thing I have ever seen in a product, and my wife agrees.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And I&#x27;ve had kudos from my own dentist for less plague and damage from brushing too hard.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really see much difference between this one and the more expensive one so for $20 less</li>
            <li> The toothbrush head tray has a cover that folds down to keep dust and other random things off it it; this is wonderful for my inner germophobe.  </li>
            <li> If you have questions, please ask!rush head tray has a cover that folds down to keep dust and other random things off it it; this is wonderful for my inner germophobe.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;After originally buying the brush, I had read about charging issues and thought that it could be overcome with careful charging (i.e. only putting it on the charger when the unit was empty, not after each brushing.</li>
            <li> Wireless SmartGuide thingy is a little difficult to get set up (at least it was for me), but having the timer &amp; being able to see how long I need to spend in each area is great.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m still trying to give it a chance, but as of right now I&#x27;m not real thrilled with the purchase.  </li>
            <li> useful aspect of the external display is that there is an indicator which lights up red when the brush detects that you are brushing too hard (if you&#x27;re putting too much pressure on the brush).  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I have always been lectured from dentists for brushing too hard in one particular location - where I always start brushing first.  </li>
            <li> I usually use the deep clean and the massage mode.</li>
            <li> His toothbrush did not last nearly as long as mine did,  and mine was older than his was.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Well, truth be told, our teeth and gums look and feel much cleaner with two minutes of use with this brush than five minutes with any other brush.  </li>
            <li> That among other reasons resulted in this purchase, and I was really amazed at the difference now that I am using this powered toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned my share of electric dental appliances (Waterpiks, Sonicares, other Oral B brushes), but this really is the creme de la creme.  </li>
            <li> We have bought additional brushes for the other functions and they all work very well.  </li>
            <li> It cleans extremely welll and fast.  </li>
            <li> The other three are absolutely made up and have no practical use.</li>
            <li> Thanks a lot, but switching to other brand.</li>
            <li> The floss action has some flat plastic pieces instead of being all brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The floss action has some flat plastic pieces instead of being all brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> like the red light that comes on when you&#x27;re brushing too hard.</li>
            <li> Some of the attachments - wireless smartguide, which is not only to help you brush the recommended two minutes, but also \\&quot;light up\\&quot; if you brush too hard - feel like overkill, meant to justify the $100</li>
            <li> you brush too hard, a red light flashes on both the toothbrush and the display..</li>
            <li> This one also has a red light to warn when brushing too hard.</li>
            <li> The other complaint is that it seems like it takes the toothbrush a considerable amount of time to recharge and the battery does not seem to last for more than about 10-12 brushes before it needs to be recharged.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t keep it very long, but at least I don&#x27;t have to look at that vapid happy face.</li>
            <li> 5 years old Oral-B (some old and less professional model) has passed away, after serving me loyally&lt;br</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B008PEMBNC Oral-B Professional Precision 1000 Rechargeable Toothbrush]], which is basically the same brush, but without the external display.  </li>
            <li> My wife has a Sonicare toothbrush that provides a really short stutter in brushing action every 30 seconds, which doesn&#x27;t interrupt the brushing process, but provides enough feedback to alert the user that another 30 seconds has passed.  </li>
            <li> My wife has a Sonicare toothbrush that provides a really short stutter in brushing action every 30 seconds, which doesn&#x27;t interrupt the brushing process, but provides enough feedback to alert the user that another 30 seconds has passed.  </li>
            <li> Normally I wouldn&#x27;t think to spend $100 on a toothbrush, but since my last one had lasted so long, I thought what the heck.  </li>
            <li> They market this same basic device called  Oral-B Smartseries 5000 Professional Care Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush that has the precision cleaning brush head.</li>
            <li> I do use the SmartGuide so that I know when to move to the next quadrant of my mouth, although at times I&#x27;ve brushed considerably longer than the preset</li>
            <li> You just move from tooth to tooth slowly for perfectly clean</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is by far the most expensive model toothbrush I have ever owned.  </li>
            <li> Where the Sonicare left things on my teeth, and i was kind of difficult to get on the inside, this toothbrush does thoroughly.</li>
            <li> I go from tooth to tooth slowly, applying a little pressure at the gum line of each and find that it takes exactly 30 seconds to clean each quadrant.  </li>
            <li> If you have a grill full of aged dental work, this toothbrush could wreak havic if you don&#x27;t use one of the settings to tone it down a notch or two.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My kids were brushing lazily and quickly; it was starting to impact their check ups, so we purchased this, and put the timer up on their mirror.  </li>
            <li> know that this brush is of high quality and that it will last a long time, but if you don&#x27;t need all the extra features, a lower-priced model will probably suit your needs just as well.</li>
            <li> Price isn&#x27;t bad and the product is amazing!</li>
            <li> At least Oral B could send a box (like many other companies) and pay the shipping costs.  </li>
            <li> And, while on the topic of charging, this also has lights that show you how much the toothbrush has charged, which is not present on the other \\&quot;Vitality\\&quot; series toothbrush.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I only ever use the highest speed mode anyway, and don&#x27;t really see a purpose for the other modes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is a dim grey LED display on a gray background.  </li>
            <li> The only regret is that it looked exactly the same other model I have bought last year</li>
            <li> I usually use the sensitive setting because my gums are sensitive to the normal setting.</li>
            <li> If it lasts as long as I do I will have completely forgotten about the price.</li>
            <li> We will see if this one lasts as long as my old one did.  </li>
            <li> My last one barely made it to one year.</li>
            <li> I tell her that I introduced the Flintsones to the Jetsons long ago and switched to the Oral B with the Floss Action</li>
            <li> The first few times I used this Oral B, I felt like I had been to the dentist.</li>
            <li> multiple settings on the toothbrush are the second most irritating feature on a product ever.  </li>
            <li> It just works as described, but it needs to be recharged at least every 2 days (reason of not letting 5 stars) to keep it working at full speed all the time.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned a few oral-b electric toothbrushes over the last few decades and have enjoyed them all.  </li>
            <li> Otherwise buy one with less features and no \\&quot;Smart</li>
            <li> When I&#x27;m down to one square and plug it up for recharging it takes the whole day to fully charge.</li>
            <li> At first glance, even down to the accessories, it looks nearly identical to the old model, barring an LED-based display on the brush-body rather than the LCD used previously, functions almost identically, and even takes the same heads.</li>
            <li> I had the older version of this toothbrush and used the non oral b replacement heads and felt they did not work as well as the other.  </li>
            <li> While I really like this product and recommend it highly, the one beef I have is with the location of the secondary button.  </li>
            <li> I should have dumped my old one a long time ago!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if other brands are better or worse, but for me, I am sticking with my old fashion toothbrush as opposed to a brushing device like this one.  </li>
            <li> : while I liked the cleaning of the Oral-B, like the timer, like the color rings for multiple users, the price/value relationship does not work, due to the poor battery.</li>
            <li> My old Oral-B was no longer holding a charge very long</li>
            <li> you can reduce this by taking the brush head off after every use, rinsing it out then shaking it dry.. but to completely eliminate the mildew, I wash out the brush heads in hydrogen peroxide every couple of weeks which seems to work well.  </li>
            <li> remote display works really well, shows how long you&#x27;ve brushing and has 4 quadrants that fill up after 30 seconds of brushing.</li>
            <li> I only hope this one lasts as long as the old one.</li>
            <li> Only a round brush seems logical to me.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Only a round brush seems logical to me.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s worth all the money compared to a regular toothbrush.</li>
            <li> The battery indicator is fairly useless as it will still show a full or 2/3 charge when the brush really needs to be charged to avoid it being sluggish.  </li>
            <li> The round head is OK for a small mouth</li>
            <li> not sure if they actually do anything, but they are fun.  </li>
            <li> First off, it took a few times to get use to the idea of staying in a quadrant until it tells you to move on to the next.  </li>
            <li> not sure it&#x27;s worth the extra cash, but I do like the timer.</li>
            <li> the wow factor was limited.</li>
            <li> Switched back from Sonicare to Oral B as I find the small round toothbrushes better remove plaque for me.  </li>
            <li> the light will turn red if you&#x27;re brushing too hard!</li>
            <li> I naturally ordered another and hope to get half of what the old one did.</li>
            <li> This whole thing confused me at first, so I will repeat: the units are the same and they both have different cleaning modes but for each thing you need a different head, each are purchased separately.</li>
            <li> The timer is a nifty little thing that activates the moment the toothbrush is activated and even tells you when you&#x27;re applying too much pressure as you brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really want some little device giving me smiley faces when I brush well.  </li>
            <li> It is highly dependent on angle and such of the brush and where or how this tooth brush determines the over brushing is not right.  </li>
            <li> I prefer that over the new &#x27;floss&#x27; or other head.</li>
            <li> My other Braun toothbrush battery died so I went on the hunt for a new one.  </li>
            <li> New toothbrush fits in the other one but does not charge.  </li>
            <li> The older one would decrease in power as the battery ran down, this one holds the charge evenly until it wears out-</li>
            <li> Its fun to brush now and let the electric motor do all the hard work.</li>
            <li> The floss action really works for hard to reach teeth.</li>
            <li> I find that by setting it high on a shelf it is out of the way, and looking up at it keeps toothpaste foam from running down my chin.</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush, but the lack of a dual voltage charger is stupid.  </li>
            <li> It actually gently massages the gums while cleaning, and for me, this is working well even in a delicate crown area where the gum has prior recession and which used to feel mildly sensitive throughout the day.  </li>
            <li> The battery display on hers is far superior, actual display instead of idiot lights that flash for 10 seconds and then disappear.  </li>
            <li> is also angled down so that any extra water doesn&#x27;t just sit on the bristles and they dry much faster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>

            <li> so I can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s better or worse than other similar products.</li>
            <li> My only previous comparison was the Sonic, and that was a lot longer, but it was also less powerful, so there is a trade off.</li>
            <li> This is my second Oral-B with the other one being about 15 years old.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive teeth and so the rotating head and vibrations due Nothing to help it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t find it user friendly and I am truly not happy with the product.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes, but the little paddles just beat up my gums.</li>
            <li> My husband had already used this [gift], so I didn&#x27;t return it (also didn&#x27;t want to deal with the hassle), but since he used it the first time, it turn red and vibrates to tell him he is brushing too hard (even if it isn&#x27;t in his mouth).  </li>
            <li> The brush stops for a second to let you know that you have cleaned on quarter of your teeth long enough</li>
            <li> The only draw back is it takes a long time to re-charge.</li>
            <li> It just arrived a few days ago, but I can already tell a difference after using an older electric Oral B for years.  </li>
            <li> The charge on this does not last and it is not very old.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t find it to be clumsy or heavy at all, and enjoy the solid feel of the handle overall.  </li>
            <li> Will update on Philips after longer use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brushing between Philips and Oral-B is different, due to the lower frequency in the Braun, not sure whether one is better than the other, my dentist has no preference, which I assume is due to him not seeing any differences between patients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t quite get it at first, but it also helps you to know when you&#x27;re brushing too hard</li>
            <li> This new handle uses LED lighting instead, which only lights up when the handle is powered on and for a few seconds after being powered off.  </li>
            <li> The metal plate grip gives this toothbrush a solid, and heavy - it is heavy to use, especially when compared with my current Oral B \\&quot;Vitality\\&quot; toothbrush, but on the flip side, the brush rotates and oscillates at a higher frequency than my current toothbrush.</li>
            <li> When I floss at night, I notice is that there is less crud left between my teeth when using this brush with it&#x27;s Floss Action head..  </li>
            <li> /&gt;While some consider the LCD of dubious value, it&#x27;s really easy for bad habits to creep up, and two of mine were not brushing long enough, and brushing with too much force.</li>
            <li> Perhaps I have a slightly dud battery, but if the power is down to one bar on the brush, you can put it on to charge first thing in the morning</li>
            <li> I never realized how long I should actually be brushing my teeth!  </li>
            <li> The battery does not hold charge for long enough.</li>
            <li> it comes with a travel case and the battery seems to last a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I brush long enough?</li>
            <li> While the Oral-B heads are a bit bigger than the Sonicare, it didn&#x27;t take long to get used to it.  </li>
            <li> but now I know I always brush long enough.  </li>
            <li> Long lasting built in rechargeable battery.  </li>
            <li> It will warn you if you are brushing in the same spot for too long.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall if you are looking for a long term investment on your teeth (and you should, since they will hopefully be with you you entire life), I could recommend this product.</li>
            <li> and there&#x27;s only one minor feature</li>
            <li> so they brush their teeth long enough.  </li>
            <li> It has the wireless assist that has the current time and tells you how long to brush each quadrant in your mouth.  </li>
            <li> When you activate your toothbrush it sends a signal to the SmartGuide and shows how long you have been brushing your teeth and with the use of multiple icons how well you have been doing.  </li>
            <li> The toothbrush rattles when it runs, which tells me it won&#x27;t last too long...</li>
            <li> The flossing brushes do their job but true flossing with floss is needed at least once every other day in my opinion.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint in the battery department is that this unit charges even more slowly than its predecessor, which used to recharge overnight.</li>
            <li> What I mean by sluggish is that the motor noticeably slows down from its peak output, so you&#x27;re not going to get the same clean.  </li>
            <li> I needed to replace my old oral-B 1000 toothbrush since it slowed down after nine years.  </li>
            <li> I do think this particular one is pretty expensive and the handle is a bit bulky.  </li>
            <li> The Oral-B Precision 5000 is far from being whisper quiet, so be prepared for a little noise once you switch it on.  </li>
            <li> in all, it is a good toothbrush, but not much better (and in some ways, worse) than previous models.</li>
            <li> Stored flat, the heads cannot drip dry as well, especially with the cover over them.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hoping it will make my next dental cleaning much quicker, since that is always a hard area to keep pristine.  </li>
            <li> This is something I do appreciate as brushing too hard can really do a job on your gums (especially with a manual brush).  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a major problem and doesn&#x27;t stop you from continuing with your brushing, but it does shift the time counter that accompanies the unit.  </li>
            <li> I had a different brand of electric toothbrush prior to this which did not have this issue due to a different brush head design.  </li>
            <li> I also like the little timer that reminds me to change quadrants every 30 or 45 seconds and displays a little frown-y face when I brush with excessive vigor, which I apparently do most of the time.  </li>
            <li> dead on arrival, despite installation of new batteries to replace those that came with the unit.</li>
            <li> For the previous Triumph model, I can charge a completely drained toothbrush in about 12 hours.  </li>
            <li> My previous model which is a couple of years old can go for almost 2 weeks before it needs to be re-charged.  </li>
            <li> It replaced a previous Oral-B electric Brush which was decades old.  </li>
            <li> Instead of the usual 2 minute, 30 seconds per quadrant routine of the normal mode... you simply brush your teeth for 3 minutes, or 45 seconds per quadrant.</li>
            <li> default \\&quot;Floss Action 3 pack brush head\\&quot; that ships with the unit is too harsh - and in my view has eroded my gum line over initial months&#x27; use.  </li>
            <li> I really do not need/use the extra clock included because the built in timer in the brush handle beeps when you should brush a different quadrant.  </li>
            <li> The case not only keeps the brush heads from being crushed but it protects the actual device.</li>
            <li> The case not only keeps the brush heads from being crushed but it protects the actual device.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Setting the timer doodle is a little challenging, but that is a minor unnecessary improvement in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The only thing that is made by \\&quot;Oral-b\\&quot; is the single brush head that came in the package.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> There are three bars on the brush to indicate battery strength; to go from a single blinking red bar to a fully charged brush takes somewhere between 18-24 hours.</li>
            <li> It only came with one, single brush head.</li>
            <li> a 60-day money back guarantee and 2-Year limited warranty for replacement or repair of product is included.</li>
            <li> I fully expect to scale back to a single annual cleaning visit.  </li>
            <li> I was a bit hesitant to purchase this toothbrush due to the cost, but I have no regrets at all.  </li>
            <li> But then it automatically starts back up, so you don&#x27;t loose a lot of time.</li>
            <li> and it can be very hard to decide which features are useful.  </li>
            <li> The Precision 5000 is a alot heavier, noisier and has way more vibration, to the point of being annoying whilst brushing, especially when brushing behind the top front teeth.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Luckily the large stand build to accommodate several different brush heads can be removed, so the brushes standing profile is as small as with previous products.</li>
            <li> Not a huge improvement, but I like the new one better because it doesn&#x27;t get your bathroom counter dirty with toothpaste residue.  </li>
            <li> The design change from a brush to a rubber strip makes this model less effective - an obvious cost cutting move that will result in dissatisfied customers - like me</li>
            <li> /&gt;We have always brushed for about five minutes with other brushes and actually balked at the two minute brushing time recommended with this brush.  </li>
            <li> The one I received just had a standard US plug attached to a white cable and on the other end it had the charger, which goes into the end of the toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> In the past with the older product I sometimes didn&#x27;t always brush for the recommended two minutes.</li>
            <li> It is early days, but I also feel that it lasts longer on a single charge than my current toothbrush, which means if you go out of town for a few days, you needn&#x27;t carry the charger along.</li>
            <li> Mine did not have a large (thick) plug as in the pictures posted.</li>
            <li> It also seems to work ok behind my wisdom teeth (a very tight place).  </li>
            <li> and they promptly sent me a new Smart Guide which I was unable to sync with the toothbrush handle.</li>
            <li> The old version had a small display which showed the charge level, in 4 different increments.  </li>
            <li> All in all, a minor problem.</li>
            <li> have proof that the way one cares for their electric toothbrush battery will determine how long the battery will</li>
            <li> Note to the inexperienced, having all these different modes doesn&#x27;t make a difference.</li>
            <li> long charging time    </li>
            <li> Should have gone this route a long time ago vs manual brushing....</li>
            <li> I expected it to last a lot longer than a year.</li>
            <li> Hope this one lasts as long.</li>
            <li> Like getting a professional cleaning everyday.</li>
            <li> I like the timer that shows how long I&#x27;ve been brushing.</li>
            <li> I have been a faithful Oral-B electric toothbrush user for as long as I can remember.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;There is a remote external display which stays in radio contact with the brush.  </li>
            <li> it times how long you brush and that it vibrates to let you know when it&#x27;s time to move on to another section of your mouth.  </li>
            <li> this brush is so versatile with a long life battery</li>
            <li> Wish I had purchased one a long time ago.</li>
            <li> I had a Braun electric toothbrush for a long time and needed a change.  </li>
            <li> Will ask for replacement and hope it will not take long to get it (without additional costs)...</li>
            <li> have a polarized or grounded plug, strange to see nowadays.</li>
            <li> The battery lasts a long time and it recharges overnight.  </li>
            <li> reminds you how long you are to brush.</li>
            <li> the battery lasts a long time between charges.  </li>
            <li> It also scores your brushing based on how long you brush each time.</li>
            <li> Smiley\\&quot; mobile/clock device gives the children cues on where and how long they should brush.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know why I waited so long to get one of these.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll see immediate and long term results from this product.</li>
            <li> will see how long it lasts.</li>
            <li> I have absolutely no problems with this product only to say I wish I had purchased it years ago.  </li>
            <li> bottom line, would give a 5 plus rating to the 4000 precision model though what i purchased was the 5000 model with the remote thing of no personal use to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> Also hold charge for a long time</li>
            <li> Two minutes feels like a long time when brushing to adults, to kids</li>
            <li> I think the battery charging system takes way too long.  </li>
            <li> When it&#x27;s not telling you which quadrant to brush and how long you been brushing, it doubles as an unobtrusive clock.  </li>
            <li> : Kinda a long charging time.</li>
            <li> I have a couple of chronic pin point stains in my lower incisors which my dental hygienist never completely gets out.  </li>
            <li> This is a long life review of the oralb 3735.</li>
            <li> That is really a minor issue.  </li>
            <li> TO REMIND YOU HOW LONG TO BRUSH--</li>
            <li> Action\\&quot; heads (too harsh) and instead, order the optional \\&quot;Sensitive</li>
            <li> I like that it keeps me informed as to which quadrant I am on, and how long I have been brushing on it.  </li>
            <li> The battery doesn&#x27;t hold a charge as long as my wife&#x27;s before it needs recharging.  </li>
            <li> It also has a timer with a digital readout I can watch that beeps when you have spent 30 seconds on each quadrant of your mouth.</li>
            <li> After another 30 seconds you get a pause twice as long, with two beeps.  </li>
            <li> After another 30 seconds you get a pause twice as long, with two beeps.  </li>
            <li> It also tells you how long to brush in each quarant of your mouth.  </li>
            <li> The timer keeps track of how long you need to brush each quadrant of your mouth</li>
            <li> should you be forgetful (such as when you are groggy in the morning).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought the Oral-B Professional 5000 toothbrush a few years ago.  </li>
            <li> but now I have brushed a full two minutes every time I have used this toothbrush without fail.  </li>
            <li> Finally broke down and splurged and figured I would go big.</li>
            <li> I now know just how firmly I can press down before it&#x27;s too much for my enamel.</li>
            <li> I thought the old brush was a 5-star product, so I can&#x27;t see that this one is anything less than a 5-star product either!</li>
            <li> I thought the old brush was a 5-star product, so I can&#x27;t see that this one is anything less than a 5-star product either!</li>
            <li> the last independent test results I saw gave the Oral-b a slight edge</li>
            <li> Not sure if they will continue the form factor for the next few generations, but a positive sign.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I understand that pictures mean the manual can be used in any language, but some clarifying text really would be nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I understand that pictures mean the manual can be used in any language, but some clarifying text really would be nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The Smart Guide also shows you what brushing mode you are using, displays an icon to show you when it is time to replace your brush head, and also has a red (might be dark orange) lighted indicator to warn if you are pressing against your teeth too hard with the brush.  </li>
            <li> I like the timer feature that beeps every 30 seconds (one, two, three or four little beeps depending on which half minute segment you&#x27;re on and the little visual timer helps if I&#x27;m not listening to the beeps and want to know how much time is left or when I have to change area.</li>
            <li> I have had Oral-B brushes for a long time and loved them, but this has a very hard head that makes brushing uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> If the brush is only used for thirty seconds instead of two minutes, the LCD will show that fact (not sure for how long, but it &amp;#34;sticks&amp;#34; afterwards long enough for the next person at the sink to see).</li>
            <li> The technology has improved considerably since then, but what has really improved is the ease of cleaning the unit; until newer models like this, it was almost impossible to clean the brush holder and the scum build-up was both maddening and unhealthful.</li>
            <li> Before if I was brushing too hard the clock/ monitor would flash a small red light, however I tend to be half asleep when I brush and missed the notice.</li>
            <li> Also, I have apparently been brushing to hard -- this brush lets you know right away if you are brushing too hard.</li>
            <li> The replacement brush heads are a little pricey but only need replacement every several months</li>
            <li> They seem to expire and offer you nothing extra after the warranty expires (other than 15% off).  </li>
            <li> You have 5 different brushing methods to choose from 2 min or 3 min, feather and polish and one other.</li>
            <li> It came with a deep cleaning brush hear which is a little larger than the brush head I am use to using.  </li>
            <li> Unlike some of the other reviewers, I haven&#x27;t used an electric toothbrush until recently.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;While you get the same basic electric brush, the question was whether the small improvements make up for the price difference, and the answer is a definite yes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am a long-time user of Oral B electric toothbrushes and have tried several other brands as well.</li>
            <li> The only other \\&quot;mode\\&quot; I like to shift to brush in is the \\&quot;Plus\\&quot; mode, which gives me 45-second intervals without interruption</li>
            <li> The only other \\&quot;mode\\&quot; I like to shift to brush in is the \\&quot;Plus\\&quot; mode, which gives me 45-second intervals without interruption</li>
            <li> Funny thing is that it does come with a travel case, but I guess Oral B is telling you that you can only travel within the US or for the time that the battery will last or bring a manual toothbrush and leave your expensive electrical one at home.</li>
            <li> Every 30 seconds, it gives a little extra buzz to let you know to move to a different quadrant of your mouth.</li>
            <li> really like the remote smily guy that monitors brushing time and whether you&#x27;re pushing too hard with the tooth brush.  </li>
            <li> However, the automatic cutoff for brushing too hard is just about the most irritating feature I have ever seen for any product I have ever used ever.  </li>
            <li> I expect to have this toothbrush for a very long time.  </li>
            <li> Also the brush compartment protects the brushes from whatever splashes out of your sink, but leaves room for air to circulate to dry the brushes.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on the more expensive Precision models.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is when my husband has to wake early and brushes his teeth.</li>
            <li> It is bulky and very difficult to use around your cheeks, which is pretty much everywhere in your mouth.  </li>
            <li> The wireless charging base is pretty cool too.</li>
            <li> blinking LED while charging    Due to the absence of the LCD panel, the charging progress is indicated by blinking LED lights.  </li>
            <li> I really like hold the charger pops out of the base for travel and it ha a very useful traveler case which is included.</li>
            <li> single voltage charger    </li>
            <li> The charger is now single voltage which means that I have to bring along a voltage transformer when I travel.  </li>
            <li> It did not include a single brush head.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I like seeing the red warning light when I fall back into the bad habit of being a power brusher.</li>
            <li> My husband loves the toothbrush, but it is not worth the extra money for the extras.  </li>
            <li> This toothbrush has a remote pressure detector which I have never seen before, and it is a neat feature, particularly helping me identify those areas I have been brushing too hard</li>
            <li> When my brush broken after a month it took nearly 3 months and constant follow ups to get my brush back.</li>
            <li> That is probably the reason the heads became loose, and caused the toothbrush to not work.</li>
            <li> At the end of the day, it is a tooth brush and come down to personal preference.</li>
            <li> I do not like the constant slowing down of the spinner.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t want your entire world to be turned upside down, don&#x27;t purchase this</li>
            <li> It has held a charge during missions lasting 2 weeks and has never let me down.</li>
            <li> Very little of anything left between my teeth when I floss following use.</li>
            <li> The 5 modes are hardly necessary and offer very little different results, if any, in my experience.</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t think I would see any difference, other than that it was easier for me to use as the brush is smaller (easier and neater to brush behind teeth.</li>
            <li> previous owned a different model:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The short-comings of this present model compared to the previous are    1)</li>
            <li> I hope that Braun would take notice of these short-comings and bring back the previous generation of Trimph toothbrush.    </li>
            <li> One and a half year later, the battery is now gone.  </li>
            <li> It is somewhat smaller than the previous version, so that is a plus.  </li>
            <li> I have had my current one over a year and a half</li>
            <li> Cut my last dental cleaning time in half.</li>
            <li> This one is a step from the simple one I previously had,  </li>
            <li> the same brush heads as the previous 2-3 generations</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s 110-volts only, not 110-230 as it was with previous one.</li>
            <li> previous Precision Oral-B did not used to have these beeps, and instead the motor just vibrated every 30 seconds to let you know to move on to the next quadrant of your mouth.</li>
            <li> This was much less invasive, and hopefully Oral-B will go back to this style, since nothing should be interrupting our teeth</li>
            <li> Previous brush ended the same, but lasted</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been skeptical about powered toothbrushes because of their high cost and asked my dentist who said it was matter of personal preference between the standard toothbrush and powered.</li>
            <li> thought the smartguide was really quite dumb.</li>
            <li> Not sure if harder brushing actually hurts my oral health, but definitely makes the brush heads wear out faster.</li>
            <li> One annoying thing about the new version is the LED light turns off when not brushing.  </li>
            <li> Next visit, I expect the hygienist to ask my new dental secret.  </li>
            <li> Now (roughly 12 months later), the batter lasts about half that time.  </li>
            <li> brush head is easier to get in to the tight spaces  on my back teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> With the new 5,000 the motor slows down from the excessive friction just like the 1,000.</li>
            <li> The charging base is better than the last generation (which allowed mucky water/toothpaste to drip down it onto your bathroom counter), and overall it works</li>
            <li> The first few brushes it was a little difficult getting used to timed brushing by quadrant, but now I couldn&#x27;t brush any other way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smart guide (battery operated electric device you can mount on the wall that times you, lets you see what settings you&#x27;re using, which quadrant you&#x27;re supposed to be on, etc.)</li>

            <li> It also has \\&quot;Wireless Smart Guide\\&quot; which just annoyed me.  </li>
            <li> have only had my 5000 for a little over a week now,  so I cannot comment on battery life as yet,  </li>
            <li> Only wish it were a little easier to program the timer.  </li>
            <li> Why not spend a little extra on your teeth.</li>
            <li> little digital display thing that comes with the toothbrush I have never used with either of the toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li> You have little digital clock/indicator (the brush and clock connected by wireless radio signal) show you what type of cleaning settings your using.  </li>
            <li> a little timer/pressure monitor/clock which probably isn&#x27;t necessary.  </li>
            <li> At each of my cleanings, including one I recently had after having used this toothbrush for a number of weeks, the hygienist and dentist always compliment me on how little plaque I have, so that&#x27;s a compliment to the Oral-B design as well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I only wish it was a little quieter.</li>
            <li> Last office cleaning, my hygienist told me she had to look for the plaque, there was so little.  </li>
            <li> It counts the seconds on a little clock and pauses every 30 seconds to remind you to divide the brushing time equally among the four quadrants of your mouth.</li>
            <li> Reaches tough spots and is gentle on the gums.</li>
            <li> How do I know how hard to push?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Listen to beeps and/or watch visual display to get back on track brushing correctly 30 sec per quadrant.&lt;br /&gt;Beep</li>
            <li> it was improperly cleaned (for I was afraid to apply too much force to that sensitive area), and as a result, gum health was degrading.  </li>
            <li> The only thing I could possibly say negatively about this toothbrush is the lack of instruction that comes with it.  </li>
            <li> The only thing I could possibly say negatively about this toothbrush is the lack of instruction that comes with it.  </li>
            <li> It holds enough power for at least 8-10 brushings lasting about 3-3:30 minutes each.</li>
            <li> I have not traveled with it yet, so I&#x27;m not sure how long the battery will last while not being charged.</li>
            <li> Since I have been using this brush, I have had two cleanings and both times they did minimal scraping</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t taken the time to use the remote yet.  </li>
            <li> It is a Ni-Mh, but I expected it to last at least a year or so of constant use before it showed signs of battery fatigue.</li>
            <li> settings.(soft, firm, pulsating).&lt;br /&gt;Comes with basic pro brush head but</li>
            <li> Since they go through all the trouble of the external display, why couldn&#x27;t they make it so you could choose and set your default options?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So even if it&#x27;s been charging overnight, and I take it off the charger, put it in its travel case, get to my location 2 hours later, and try to brush my teeth there, it would be dead.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item as a gift so there for I can not really rate it myself.  </li>
            <li> It holds it&#x27;s charge very well and lasts for approximately two weeks</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s almost like a robot, leaving one with not much else to do but put it in your mouth and hold.  </li>
            <li> Maybe that&#x27;s not really a</li>
            <li> Again I have only used the brush for a few days</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve replaced batteries on several models of ipods, so I know a few tricks</li>
            <li> plus I&#x27;ll have to pay shipping to their service center.  </li>
            <li> Because it is a closed system, there is no fear of mold or gunk gathering in the handle or</li>
            <li> The hygienist looked at my teeth and said \\&quot;obviously to floss everyday...</li>
            <li> only been using it for a few nights</li>
            <li> I bought this tooth brush roughly 5 years ago because i smoke and stains come with the territory.</li>
            <li> I was in the military and it has survived longer then my combat boots.</li>
            <li> It has been through Iraq, Afghanistan, Kyrgyzstan, Ireland, Kuwait, Germany, Dominican Republic, and across the USA with absolutely no problems.</li>
            <li> I feel like when I just leave the dentist (minus the bleeding gums).</li>
            <li> really needed to step up my game in the toothbrush department</li>
            <li> In only a few minutes, the agent directed me in setting the unit so it was in sink with the tooth brush.</li>
            <li> thing I have noticed is that you have to be careful with what type of toothpaste to use.  </li>
            <li> thing I have noticed is that you have to be careful with what type of toothpaste to use.  </li>
            <li> years, I&#x27;ve been going to two annual cleaning visits because I&#x27;ve always had trouble cleaning properly.  </li>
            <li> While I understand the concept behind the physical feedback, to let you know it&#x27;s time to switch quadrants in your mouth, and that the physical feedback eliminates the need to watch the LCD display for visual indicators, I don&#x27;t appreciate the interruption in the brushing motion.  </li>
            <li> They are also a few shades whiter after using this for only a week!</li>
            <li> Initial charge took about 15 hours to complete.&lt;br /&gt;Bought this to replace the Zila Rotadent which I&#x27;d left behind on my last trip to my mom&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> Convenient because it takes up minimal room on the counter.</li>
            <li> remote beeps and the toothbrush</li>
            <li> I have only had this Oral-B a couple of week and will write an update in a few months.  </li>
            <li> 2 months later battery is dead.</li>
            <li> After two minutes, it gives a few extra buzzes</li>
            <li> I can tell you there is absolutely NO CUSTOMER SERVICE</li>
            <li> The old version had a ring base that the toothbrush fit into.  </li>
            <li> My only real complaint about the new Precision 5000 series toothbrush is the pause in brushing every 30 seconds.  </li>
            <li> They charge a stiff price for the toothbrush (lets face it, they aren&#x27;t cheap by any means) and expensive replacement heads.</li>
            <li> Works great but a little awkward, probably will get use to it!!</li>
            <li> To tell you the truth, it has surpass all my expectations, and I&#x27;m not easy to please, especially with high-end acquisitions.  </li>
            <li> If you can do without that, the 1000 is less than half the price for what is basically the same brush.nd timer which pauses after each section and five modes of operation.  </li>
            <li> If you can do without that, the 1000 is less than half the price for what is basically the same brush.</li>
            <li> our old Oral B&#x27;s my wife and I were always concerned about brushing too hard, as if we might accidentally sand down our bicuspids until they resembled a row of partially dissolved Altoids.</li>
            <li> first I thought the little smiley face timer was unnecessary</li>
            <li> However, all these features they add on to justify raising the price are not very useful at all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m used to it now, but it&#x27;s in a perfectly awkward spot; I mistakenly turned the brush off several times when I was first starting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The customer service is very difficult to get in touch with and again, the process of getting this thing fixed is going to be a real pain.  </li>
            <li> I am forever brushing my teeth and all of the sudden the toothbrush slows down or gets choppy because my fingers hit the button to change the speed or mode or whatever it is.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s basically designed so that you can&#x27;t put it down on a flat surface and read it easily because it slopes backwards awkwardly, and you can&#x27;t mount it on the left side of a mirror if there is something just to the left of it, because of the weird way the thing slides.</li>
            <li> I switched to Oral B because the heads on my previous two Sonicare toothbrushes, kept coming loose.</li>
            <li> This is my second version and it&#x27;s changed very little.</li>
            <li> I was a past owner of two Sonicare toothbrushes for ten years and decided to change it up.</li>
            <li> and it is extremely helpful.</li>
            <li> used to hurt due to all the scraping they had to do on my teeth.  </li>
            <li> This review is for the Triumph 5000 but applies to Oral-B&#x27;s other high-end Triumph brushes since my partner and I</li>
            <li> Other then the battery</li>
            <li> Even my dental hygienist commented on the improvement just the other day.  </li>
            <li> I am not sure if you need a different brush head or not.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> other brushes</li>
            <li> I have yet to try the other features.</li>
            <li> I have seen hundreds of patients who are regularly using this device show unbelievable improvement in their oral health condition.  </li>
            <li> We used the Oral-B brush for 2 years and like the way it cleans, but have now decided to switch to Philips Sonicare, due to the battery</li>
            <li> After reading other reviews I decided to go with this.</li>
            <li> Other reviews &amp; 3.</li>
            <li> My mouth feels cleaner than with any other toothbrush, and my teeth are noticeably whiter.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Because of this, I was not able to use it since the VOLTAGE is totaly different in Singapore and US.</li>
            <li> I have used other electronic toothbrushes</li>
            <li> and it was starting to look a bit ordinary.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Now, regarding the 5000 versus other Oral-B models.  </li>
            <li> only worked at regular power, and [[ASIN:B000GBICYE Vitality]] was rather weak.</li>
            <li> , I have never used any of the other heads, and keep them in a drawer.</li>
            <li> My mouth feels cleaner than with any other toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> Had to get three fillings by the gum line on one side of my mouth due to this reason.</li>
            <li> I have bought Oral-B toothbrushes several times in the past.</li>
            <li> In the past, I have only had two years of performance from the batteries in Oral-B toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> Not sure how it will work for people with smaller mouths.</li>
            <li> This replaced my other oral b which lasted 12 years</li>
            <li> I bought this on the recommendation of my dental tech after my other Oral-B toothbrush died.  </li>
            <li> I went to the store to get a replacement &amp; they were actually out of the ones I usually get and the cheapest electric model they had</li>
            <li> I am disappointed in the latest model of the Oral-B toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> and I would never imagined myself bragging about a toothbrush to other people, but</li>
            <li> This one takes 48 hours to charge where the other one would always charge overnight.  </li>
            <li> Saw a Sonicare at a dentist office the other day and when turned on sounded like a Ferrari compared to this brush.  </li>
            <li> The SmartSeries 5000 is a step up from various Oral-B models I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> This was my first EXPENSIVE toothbrush purchase...</li>
            <li> Why design a portable charger and a travel carrying case when other than USA (and countries with 110-130v)</li>
            <li> other reason for delay, was that this model seemed pricey</li>
            <li> note: the handle is quite bulky, but it is comparable to all other electric brushes on the market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This stand holds other brush heads if other family members are sharing the unit with you.</li>
            <li> Pretty lame...</li>
            <li> it is very hard to go back to a regular toothbrush.</li>
            <li> The little rack for the toothbrushes comes off if you don&#x27;t need it and the base is very small - great for traveling.</li>
            <li> I have gum recession and need to be very careful.  </li>
            <li> but when the need arises for a new brush, I&#x27;ll go shopping for one that&#x27;s of comparable quality without the unnecessary accessory.</li>
            <li> The new model beeps every 30 seconds, which makes the display part unnecessary.</li>
            <li> I agree with all the 5 star reviews out here and my only single con I can find with this system, And its a very small one...</li>
            <li> It may be slightly slower than the Precision buy not very noticable.  </li>
            <li> have to use it on the soft speed because the regular is uncomfortable to my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The problem with it is my wife spent about a half hour trying to figure out how to put the batteries in it and gave up.  </li>
            <li> But when I spent a half hour and couldn&#x27;t figure out how to get the battery cover off the d@mn thing, well it went in the closet.  </li>
            <li> Its crazy how much cleaner and healthier your teeth feel from just using it a short time.</li>
            <li> The battery life is poor and it doesn&#x27;t work on European current (220)</li>
            <li> A little rough on the teeth but cleans extremely well.</li>
            <li> complaint is that the base on which you put the toothbrush heads doesn&#x27;t have a drain at the bottom, so a little water collects at the bottom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommend buying another cleaning toothbrush head for a more complete brushing (the default head that comes with the unit is the flossing one).</li>
            <li> I have not experienced any of the normal plaque build up that I typically have between dental visits.</li>
            <li> things being equal, there&#x27;s usually some sort of rebate going on high-end Oral-B products, and if you can pick this up for less than a Benjamin, you&#x27;d do well to get in on that deal.</li>
            <li> things being equal, there&#x27;s usually some sort of rebate going on high-end Oral-B products, and if you can pick this up for less than a Benjamin, you&#x27;d do well to get in on that deal.</li>
            <li> I think my next cleaning will show much less plaque than usual.</li>
            <li> Since they all stay in vertical position, the remaining \\&quot;gunk\\&quot; flows down, and builds up on the handle, and other places.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is very difficult to clean my teeth.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately the smart guide display didn&#x27;t work from the beginning.</li>
            <li> I thought the little remote unit would be a trashable novelty.</li>
            <li> It is a little louder than I expected, and it took 2 days to fully charge.  </li>
            <li> I buy my brush heads on Amazon for about half the price than what other stores offer.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The digital device, which connects wirelessly to the brush, tells you if you are brushing too hard, when to change tooth quadrants, mode and when you are done.  </li>
            <li> It just does with out the external display and the indicator that lights up when you brush too hard.  </li>
            <li> It just does with out the external display and the indicator that lights up when you brush too hard.  </li>
            <li> and there was hardly any scraping done at this last cleaning!</li>
            <li> It says I&#x27;m pressing too hard on my teeth, even when I pull the entire brush away from my teeth.  </li>
            <li> Especially like the indicator that shows if you are pressing too hard.</li>
            <li> I can hardly wait for my next dental appointment.</li>
            <li> timer seems a little lame at first with the smiley face and countdown, but it keeps you on check with your brushing</li>
            <li> the plastic is really hard and it wont open.</li>
            <li> I also like the feature that warns you when you&#x27;re pushing too hard and also appreciate the deep cleaning cycle.</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended this toothbrush because she said I was brushing to hard with my regular tooth brush.</li>
            <li> The little digital display is a bit childish and gimmicky, but I&#x27;ve found that I use it</li>
            <li> It keeps you on-track to brushing all four quadrants of your mouth equally, and will also notify you if you are pressing down too hard when brushing.  </li>
            <li> Finally gave into buying this when I realized that I was brushing too hard and was wearing down the enamel of my teeth.</li>
            <li> Needed it very badly due to a recent broken arm that limited my strength for brushing teeth.</li>
            <li> One of the most stupid designs I have ever seen...</li>
            <li> That is the only complaint I</li>
            <li> The only drawback is that the battery loses its ability to hold a charge over time.</li>
            <li> This was cheaper here than at a local store by 60$ at least.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried everything with no success after two days and then called customer service.  </li>
            <li> You only need to spend a few seconds on each tooth to get them perfectly slick.</li>
            <li> one thing that ruins</li>
            <li> The material at base of this one seems better made.</li>
            <li> I actually use this in conjunction with a WaterPik flosser, which always loosens a few particles that the Oral-B has left behind.  </li>
            <li> I figured it out after toying with it for a while, but I shouldn&#x27;t have to do that when paying $150 for a toothbrush (thankfully, it has come down in price since I</li>
            <li> I figured it out after toying with it for a while, but I shouldn&#x27;t have to do that when paying $150 for a toothbrush (thankfully, it has come down in price since I</li>
            <li> This has caused my gum to recede down from my teeth in that spot.  </li>
            <li> I like the separate holding areas for the brushes and the ability to put the cover down.  </li>
            <li> display screen is a separate device that you can set down on your counter or stick to the wall.  </li>
            <li> The charge held for 8 days used twice a day, never slowed down.</li>
            <li> Look for rebates and coupons to keep the costs of Oral B products down.</li>
            <li> I would prefer if it just slowed down as it does every 30 seconds.</li>
            <li> I had the Oral B 1000 which broke down.</li>
            <li> The only negative is that it has slightly less battery life than my previous lower end Oral-B tooth brush.</li>
            <li> main problem that I have is that the charging base that came with this unit is only 110-130v and not the universal 110-240v.</li>
            <li> Minimal gadgets to mess with for MAXIMUM RESULTS!</li>
            <li> Been using it for at least five years and my old one just quit on me.&lt;br /&gt;Had pretty bad periodontal issues and now have none.</li>
            <li> I had the previous version of this toothbrush but felt that they could improve on a couple of things.</li>
            <li> Odd</li>
            <li> using less toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> This is the method used by a previous generation of toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> I realized that after I bought this I could have asked my dentist friends to get me one for half the price.  </li>
            <li> Have used Oral-B before, though it died in less than a year.  </li>
            <li> brushes previously and the lights all stopped blinking when it was charged.  </li>
            <li> Less, but not none</li>
            <li> less stuff to break on it.</li>
            <li> Free\\&quot; means a much less fancy package.  </li>
            <li> and i had only one serious problem.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> Works like a typical Braun.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately my previous Oral B toothbrush they stopped making brush heads for.</li>
            <li> My dentist had recommended it to me, and sure enough, since switching, I&#x27;ve had all of one cavity, and none of my checkups have involved breaking up nasty calculus bridges.</li>
            <li> /&gt;And since I&#x27;m giving out tips, getting replacement heads on Subscribe &amp; Save is a deal and a half, compared to any store I&#x27;ve been to.</li>
            <li> Previously I had [</li>
            <li> addition of the integrated head storage near the base is a real convenience.</li>
            <li> so feels less bulky in your hand and is easier to maneuver than the Oral</li>
            <li> It was not equipped for serving in both European and American voltages except by adding an expensive add on device.</li>
            <li> I typically go 1-week in between charges.</li>
            <li> The Oral B is significantly less expensive and has a greater variety of replacement brush heads which are also less expensive.  </li>
            <li> less plastics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Previously owned an electric toothbrush and was a bit reluctant to try again.  </li>
            <li> The charging cradle has been slightly improved.  </li>
            <li> so this is half a review of an electric toothbrush vs manual.  </li>
            <li> It is just as noisy as my previous toothbrush as well.  </li>
            <li> I was discouraged to see that Oral-B didn&#x27;t include the variety of head attachments that they did with my previous model.  </li>
            <li> Now my dentist visit for cleaning are cut in half of the time.</li>
            <li> previous Oral-B came with a 110-240 power supply.  </li>
            <li> I thought that even if this one didn&#x27;t come with a 110-240 v adapter (based on previous reviews), I could use my existing adapter when I travel.  </li>
            <li> You will need to floss less too.</li>
            <li> Although the unit comes with a free&#x3D;standing unit that shows the passage of the brushing time, I think that particular unit is rather useless.  </li>
            <li> The annoying part is that we discovered we were neverapplying too much pressure with our old brushes, anyway.</li>
            <li> Other makes and models pale in comparison.  </li>
            <li> This thing does it all, tells you how long to brush, how hard you should brush, where and when you should brush ...</li>
            <li> how long you brush and tells you if you are brushing too hard.  </li>
            <li> What a mess.  </li>
            <li> When you use this, it doesn&#x27;t make a mess.  </li>
            <li> Not true.</li>
            <li> I did contact Oral B after my first disappointing use and they told me to turn the toothrbush in for repair..</li>
            <li> For that matter, if I myself am rushed and tempted to skimp on brushing time, having a little electronic &amp;#34;note&amp;#34; of that fact is a slight nudge towards just being patient.</li>
            <li> Plus, the sensor that is supposed to go off when you&#x27;re brushing too hard is not sensitive at all!</li>
            <li> It is a bit long and the toothbrush literally stops for a second and it is weird.</li>
            <li> Base is easier to clean than other Oral B brushes I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
            <li> only minus was the battery compartment door was installed crooked and was very difficult to remove.  </li>
            <li> Took a little getting used to the vibration.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s called \\&quot;Brush your teeth a little longer\\&quot; mode.</li>
            <li> little wireless monitor screen.</li>
            <li> , the head doesn&#x27;t spin in circles like a dentists tools, but rather makes little wiggles side to side, making it look like it&#x27;s circling in a way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The gimmick is the little clock that times the four quadrants of your mouth.  </li>
            <li> the little smiley face has grown on me.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The little brush stand that attaches comes on and off of the charging stand.</li>
            <li> Have been the Oral B P-500 a little over a month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li> find that the brush does induce a little gag reflex periodically, which I never encountered with a manual brush.  </li>
            <li> replacement heads are a little</li>
            <li> about a week before I did a little online research &amp; decided to upgrade to the 5000 model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it brings you a little bit closer to home....</li>
            <li> My son wanted this as it was from a list of life&#x27;s little luxuries.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s little difference between the results you get from both of their high-end products (</li>
            <li> BUT I do like the little timer and smiley detector that tells you how well you brush your teeth.</li>
            <li> One downfall is that replacement brushes are little pricey.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a little fickle about brushing my teeth and flossing.</li>
            <li> It packs well, lasts a few days without a charge and the little smiley face clock</li>
            <li> The little timer was just a waste of money.  </li>
            <li> The battery cover was almost impossible to open (I pried it open), and the buttons in it are sharp and piercing to the finger.  </li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve tried many toothbrushes over the years, including the expensive one the dentist insisted we needed to purchase because my husband suffers from gum disease.  </li>
            <li> Just remember, you don&#x27;t get the menacing red light and demonic face with the 1,000 series, but you do save about $40.</li>
            <li> Only disappointment was it came with only one toothbrush, so if sharing, buy another brush head.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t heavy or bulky.</li>
            <li> This came missing a part and didn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li> have tried brushing my tongue with the round head</li>
            <li> Save yourself a few bucks and get the version that doesn&#x27;t include it.  </li>
            <li> All the ancillary timers are a waste but still five stars.</li>
            <li> , I have to go buy another toothbrush (unfortunately threw my old one out).  </li>
            <li> Kudos to Amazon for reducing packaging waste (and shipping costs),</li>
            <li> The good:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to think electric toothbrushes were a waste of money until after I bought this one (on the recommendation of my dentist).  </li>
            <li> Took a few times to get used to it</li>
            <li> I brush twice a day and do not recharge it until it is almost dead.</li>
            <li> wow - who ever thought brushing could be so complicated?  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It has been in use for a few months now</li>
            <li> What a waste of money.  </li>
            <li> your mouth feels like you&#x27;ve been to the dentist everyday ...</li>
            <li> 26M needed to step up my big boy game and turn in the manual brush.</li>
            <li> you will destroy your unit.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Wow, was I wrong.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the Philips electric toothbrush for about a year before I left it behind when traveling and the housekeeping staff threw it away.</li>
            <li> I am waiying for my dental check in a few weeks.  </li>
            <li> I will buy Oral-B again when this one goes, hopefully not for a few years.</li>
            <li> the external component and lights and crap on this one are too much.  </li>
            <li> anyone know a way to get a charging base that is universal without returning the whole unit since you never know what type of charger you will get since it&#x27;s not part of the description???</li>
            <li> The moment you apply too much pressure a menacing red light activates in the handle, and the smiley face on your LCD clock contorts into a toothless demonic entity whose appearance is so frightening you&#x27;ll drop the toothbrush in fear for your life!</li>
            <li> but I noticed that very few or no residual food &amp;#34;particles&amp;#34; are left behind at all compared to my previous toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I ordered this toothbrush because my gums were beginning to recede due to too hard brushing.</li>
            <li> If that is so, buy a low-tech toothbrush like the Oral-B vitality or a plain toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> After receiving the product in a plain brown box I grew concerned it was a nock-off.</li>
            <li> /&gt; - Keeping the base clean is a challenge.  </li>
            <li> , it seems to clean teeth if you always leave it on the charging base when not in use.</li>
            <li> The new one has a smaller base that the toothbrush is placed on.  </li>
            <li> But if you can do without the external display, you could go with the less expensive</li>
            <li> You have to press down extremely hard in order to activate it, and by that point you&#x27;re already damaging your brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also, the pause, every 30 seconds, is long and is exceedingly irritating.  </li>
            <li> Well worth it, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> It has four small rubber paddles that were really harsh on my gums.  </li>
            <li> I was pressing too hard on my teeth (because the electronic timer shows a sad face when you are pressing too hard) and b) that I was not brushing long enough.  </li>
            <li> The replacement brushes are a little expensive but they&#x27;re supposed to last about 3 months each</li>
            <li> The tooth brush lights up red when your brushing to hard because that&#x27;s unhealthy to do.</li>
            <li> My only complaint, very small complaint, is the pause every 30 seconds to indicate time to move to another area.</li>
            <li> I have permanent retainers and it has been almost impossible for me to really floss</li>
            <li> The toothbrush motor would slow down from the excessive friction.</li>
            <li> teeth cleaning by dental hygenists can be a painful experience to remove large buildups of plaque.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> /&gt;Since I am not sharing this with anyone, I am not using the toothbrush holder, so the unit takes up very little space on my sink counter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If the beeps/pauses don&#x27;t annoy you, there&#x27;s very little to dislike here.</li>
            <li> I bought this toothbrush because I have trouble brushing to hard.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used battery operated toothbrushes in the past</li>
            <li> You may have to copy and past into your browser:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> you have gum or teeth problems, the cost of this brush and additional brushheads is small.</li>
            <li> The problem is that this version of the tooth brush makes a small &amp;#34;pause&amp;#34; every 30 seconds.</li>
            <li> Not sure I would have bought it if I had known.</li>
            <li> Despite the &amp;#34;Floss Action&amp;#34; in the description, you still need to floss as usual.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure yet</li>
            <li> The menacing face on my LCD clock is convincing me to feel this way.</li>
            <li> Small footprint.</li>
            <li> I have not used the timer device that tracks brushing (I am not sure why I need that. )</li>
            <li> It is designed so that you get used to brushing for the dentist recommended two minutes, but after the fourth quadrant it merely pauses and then continues running.</li>
            <li> I was using the usual Oral-B, with the small heads, sold everywhere.</li>
            <li> I bought this brush because of my past history with oral-B.  </li>
            <li> What I received was a small brown cardboard carton with the toothbrush and accessories packed inside.  </li>
            <li> The unit fits nicely on a fairly small surface.  </li>
            <li> Mom wanted it, she uses it everyday and loves it!</li>
            <li> Totally useless for me since I only use one mode.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the Oral-B 5000 for a number of weeks during the period of time after a hygenist cleaning where I usually start to accumulate some plaque.  </li>
            <li> and if I had one caveat, it&#x27;s that the head may be a tad small.</li>
            <li> I had used one of these in the past</li>
            <li> Got this for my wife since he old brush just wasn&#x27;t cutting it.</li>
            <li> I am not sure how I gone without this.</li>
            <li> Seems excessive.</li>
            <li> In addition, the four \\&quot;modes\\&quot; of the brush are just unnecessary fluff as well.</li>
            <li> If we do not keep a paper towel under the base, it gets pretty messy there too.</li>
            <li> I  have no more to say.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still not sure I&#x27;m using it correctly</li>
            <li> As with past Oral B toothbrushes, I am concerned about the longevity of the battery.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve had oral care issues in the past, this is the brush for you.</li>
            <li> The product is well-made as usual per Oral B...</li>
            <li> Small footprint charging</li>
            <li> Small footprint charging station</li>
            <li> Will keep trying to adjust to get past that issue.</li>
            <li> br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con: Ergonomically, it was not made for small hands.  </li>
            <li> I have been using an Oral-B electric toothbrush for the past four years and regret</li>
            <li> This is a small wireless device (comes with optional wall mount and 2 AA batteries)</li>
            <li> The toothbrush bristle part is small but efficient.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s something really uncomfortable about brushing your teeth with an electric toothbrush that isn&#x27;t actually on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> hope is this one is at least half as reliable as it predecessor!  </li>
            <li> Battery not good after less than two years use, not a disaster</li>
            <li> I tried to hold out the full two minutes to brush, but it just became too uncomfortable and a little painful.  </li>
            <li> like some other reviewers I was getting gum loss behind the teeth and the dentist warned me about it.  </li>
            <li> On the Triumph series, moisture would collect at the base, and it would get gross without regular cleaning.</li>
            <li> The 5000 I purchased earlier in the year was also inductive, but the entire base of the brush just sits into a ring to charge.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed when my older Oral B toothbrush died and since it only lasted 2-3 yrs</li>
            <li> I thought the small &amp;#34;flippers&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;would be hard on my gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The setting is also broken up in segments so that as you reach each quarter of the time set, there is a pause and a slight beeping.  </li>
            <li> Just a minor annoying problem that I&#x27;ve adjusted to by holding the unit differently.</li>
            <li> The little timer gadget was impossible to even open to use so</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s hard to sing the praises of a toothbrush</li>
            <li> she bang the hard plastic on their tooth?  </li>
            <li> + stars!nd whether you&#x27;re pushing too hard with the tooth brush.  </li>
            <li> I like the sensor that tells you when you&#x27;re brushing too hard.  </li>
            <li> You could always tell when you were brushing too hard.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It warns you if you brush too hard, and that&#x27;s neat, and it pulses once</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had a problem with brushing too hard</li>
            <li> and I appreciate being notified if I&#x27;m brushing too hard.  </li>
            <li> It also keeps me from brushing too hard.</li>
            <li> Lets you know with a beep and stops if you&#x27;re pressing too hard.  </li>
            <li> It shows you your progress and lets you know if you&#x27;re brushing too hard.  </li>
            <li> The package comes with everything you need, including a stand, charger and a hard plastic travel shell.</li>
            <li> I do like the warning when you are brushing too hard on the handle.  </li>
            <li> I do like the clock timer and the lights when you are pressing too hard.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It also has a wireless &#x27;monitor&#x27;, which times your brushing and also displays a warning whenever you push too hard.</li>
            <li> and I could hardly tell a difference in the levels the brush has.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The display also shows if I am brushing too hard.</li>
            <li> However, it doesn&#x27;t have a timer and there is no display to show that one is brushing too hard.</li>
            <li> gadgety (my IT geek friends would like it) but what a cleaning job it does, even in hard to reach spots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Even shows you if you are brushing too hard.  </li>
            <li> It has an indicator to let you know when you&#x27;re brushing too hard.  </li>
            <li> This gift was bought for my sister who brushes her teeth too hard.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush has a sensor on it to tell her that she is brushing her teeth too hard.</li>
            <li> The battery in this unit holds a charge for at least a week.  </li>
            <li> This product really sucks.    </li>
            <li> Holds a charge for about 3 days, then really loses power, when you travel.</li>
            <li> Duh.</li>
            <li> I plugged the charger in and had it on the charger for at least 12 hours.  </li>
            <li> I would expect the smartguide to want you to brush your teeth (at least) twice a day, but if I miss a morning, by the evening I brush my teeth</li>
            <li> Also, they stated they will replace or repair but it would take at least 15 days.  </li>
            <li> My biggest complaint with my Sonicare Essence was clean-up.</li>
            <li> shoddy craftsmanship).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My ONLY disappointment was that when I bought the package listed on Amazon it said it included a \\&quot;refill\\&quot; head for the toothbrush.</li>
            <li> It loses some of it&#x27;s brushing power</li>
            <li> But even if you forget, it still holds a charge for at least a day.</li>
            <li> the timer reminds me not to rush when I&#x27;m late for work.</li>
            <li> and it is still winking away charging late that evening.</li>
            <li> It takes at least 24hrs.</li>
            <li> There are a confusing array of electric toothbrushes out there</li>
            <li> /&gt;Update 1. have had this for approx 8 weeks now and have slowly, sort of gotten used to it.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve been forced to buy another one for travelling purpose.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gimmicky and unnecessary.  </li>
            <li> and I mean AWHILE to charge.</li>
            <li> Other stores had wrong model.</li>
            <li> it a small investment in your oral care regimen!</li>
            <li> I have always had a terrible time cleaning my back teeth due to an over active gag reflex.</li>
            <li> My old one had a small base and would tip over</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, there&#x27;s one incredibly annoying difference between this toothbrush and the older Precision line:</li>
            <li> Just a bad design in general for the timer...</li>
            <li> This is a serious setback when I do not have time to charge the toothbrush, e.g. while traveling.    </li>
            <li> We bought Oral B&#x27;s less expensive model</li>
            <li> For the $130 or so that I paid for it, to get 6 months of a working toothbrush is absolutely ridiculous.  </li>
            <li> The instructions were less than useless in this effort as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Im afraid it will come loose</li>
            <li> would give 5 stars, but the little timer thing it comes with is useless.</li>
            <li> In fact, every 30 seconds the pause gets longer, so that you can hear this faint little beep that grows in number during each pause.  </li>
            <li> In fact, every 30 seconds the pause gets longer, so that you can hear this faint little beep that grows in number during each pause.  </li>
            <li> Cleaning of the toothbrush is easier and actually can change out the battery once it goes bad.</li>
            <li> God rid of my Sonicare for this bad boy and I haven&#x27;t looked back yet.</li>
            <li> that is so bad, my Philips shaver last for weeks after 4 hours charging</li>
            <li> My spouse has a Philips Sonicare, and had one for 7+ years, and has never had such bad battery power.</li>
            <li> When I brush my tongue, it gets all white bad breath-causing stuff off.</li>
            <li> I tend to scrub my teeth and have gum erosion which is not good, so I bit the bullet and bought the newest model.</li>
            <li> so it is not a good choice for travel.</li>
            <li> Not Good.  </li>
            <li> Its quite annoying if you are used to a continuous movement even if its probably no more than 1 second.</li>
            <li> I find the professional mode annoying too.</li>
            <li> review/complaint about the tooth breaking is just plain questionable.  </li>
            <li> By the time you get to the fourth pause, it is so long that you just stand there looking at yourself awkwardly in the mirror, waiting for the stupid thing to start brushing again.  </li>
            <li> By the time you get to the fourth pause, it is so long that you just stand there looking at yourself awkwardly in the mirror, waiting for the stupid thing to start brushing again.  </li>
            <li> It helps to ensure I&#x27;m not brushing too hard too!</li>
            <li> Not sure if the instructions are wrong or if it is defective, but after a couple weeks, I just decided to keep it.  </li>
            <li> I am only disappointed I didn&#x27;t purchase one sooner.  </li>
            <li> (need to charge every 5-6 days, with the 3min program that I usually do)&lt;br /&gt;- a bit cumbersome; its size and weight make somewhat uncomfortable to hold</li>
            <li> First, the battery is terrible.  </li>
            <li> I was disappointed that the unit was totally out of sink in monitoring my tooth brushing.</li>
            <li> No more expensive treatments sales pitches.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I tried very hard to follow it</li>
            <li> and it was very hard on my gums.</li>
            <li> We start using this toothbrush and after 3 uses, my wife told me she did not like it because it was very hard.</li>
            <li> My husband came rushing out of the bathroom this morning to inform me that the unit gave him a sad face because he was brushing too hard.  </li>
            <li> My husband came rushing out of the bathroom this morning to inform me that the unit gave him a sad face because he was brushing too hard.  </li>
            <li> I think the included LCD screen is unnecessary and clutters the bathroom counter</li>
            <li> I would hate to disappoint the LCD monitor and have it show only 3 out of 4 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really frustrating.</li>
            <li> However, it is frustrating</li>
            <li> Perhaps families that share the same base unit will.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> In my opinion its completely unnecessary.</li>
            <li> and I hate to have extra \\&quot;stuff\\&quot; (the charger)</li>
            <li> I hate how Amazon repackaged the product, Several months ago I bought this item from amazon and it was not repackaged</li>
            <li> Mine came with the travel case broken</li>
            <li> It is not uncommon to see a patient who has struggled to control gum disease, start using the brush and see the number of bleeding points drop dramatically and pockets also improve.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Like others, I find a lot of the included accessories largely unnecessary.  </li>
            <li> seeing them on a screen feels like a video game.</li>
            <li> If I had it to do again from the beginning, I&#x27;d purchase the least expensive version of this model brush, which I think is the 4000.</li>
            <li> the \\&quot;you&#x27;re brushing too hard\\&quot; pressure sensor has broken, and stays permanently on.  </li>
            <li> Not great.</li>
            <li> now resembles the traditional Oral B base where the charger has a nub that clips into a recess on the toothbrush.</li>
            <li> The SmartGuide seems unnecessary, as are the pauses and beeps every 30 seconds.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t like to brush my teeth and two minutes can seem like an eternity when I am rushing to get to work or when I am tired at the end of the night.  </li>
            <li> but I find it to be unnecessary for me.</li>
            <li> Action\\&quot; heads (provided with this purchase) were too harsh and probably a bit dangerous:  </li>
            <li> I have a lot of buildup at the base of my bottom front teeth that my dentist is constantly wanting me to take care of.</li>
            <li> I i just hated brushing my teeth in general.  </li>
            <li> but I hate its digital timer which is absuletly unnecessary and useless in my case.</li>
            <li> but this toothbrush makes the process a lot less painful.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;And, since there are four slots, depending on your preference, you might choose to share a single base among your family.</li>
            <li> In the morning when I don&#x27;t feel like paying attention this little bad boy alerts when its time to change sections of my mouth.  </li>
            <li> A few months ago I got some bad news from my dentist.</li>
            <li> I used to have an electric toothbrush when I was younger; hated it.  </li>
            <li> I was confused and angry.</li>
            <li> So these crooks cannot say I did it wrong..</li>
            <li> The biggest thing that I don&#x27;t like about it is how expensive the replacement heads are.</li>
            <li> but it makes the device useless for me.  </li>
            <li> Always thought electric tooth brushes were silly.</li>
            <li> The directions were useless.  </li>
            <li> and then ill have a spot on my wall where it pulled off the paint or something</li>
            <li> Wrong, just wrong...</li>
            <li> I hope the brush heads are not too expensive, but this toothbrush for under $140 was cheaper than anyone I found on Walmart.com.</li>
            <li> Not that expensive</li>
            <li> I was skeptical after reading reviews of the charger going out after 6 months.</li>
            <li> Had a Philips Sonicare: The replacement heads were like 3 times as expensive as the heads for this Orab B 5000 series system.  </li>
            <li> I did not have braces as a child, so I have a lot of weird crowding and gaps, so I have found a Water Pik Ultra to be my tool of choice - it is unbeatable in terms of getting out bits of food.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> something&#x27;s gone wrong.</li>
            <li> and Id have to store my expensive brush heads in a drawer somewhere.</li>
            <li> Silly</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand anyone who finds it difficult to operate/figure out.  </li>
            <li> The screen is completely useless.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I still floss after brushing</li>
            <li> Needless to say, this gift did not make it under the&lt;br /&gt;tree</li>
            <li> Timer cover difficult to remove and set up</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about spending $one hundred dollars in a toothbrush</li>
            <li> One time I had to turn the toothbrush off to answer the phone and it displayed a sad face.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Great brush, can&#x27;t go wrong with this unit.</li>
            <li> They say it&#x27;s not waterproof, but it appears to be well sealed against casual water contact.  </li>
            <li> Since I travel for work all the time, the small charging base and cord for the toothbrush and the included travel case has been a lifesaver.  </li>
            <li> The charging base and base of the 5000 is different -it</li>
            <li> WE have hard water and scaly deposits build up on the bottom of the handle and on the base.  </li>
            <li> So bad product revision and poor customer service.</li>
            <li> The replacement brushes are expensive, but cheaper than bad teeth.</li>
            <li> dirty mouth?  </li>
            <li> disappointing.</li>
            <li> I wish the timer weren&#x27;t shaped so awkwardly...</li>
            <li> This is infuriating.</li>
            <li> That area needs to be cleaned often, otherwise it stinks.</li>
            <li> but I was afraid I would chip a toot.  </li>
            <li> plus the controls are awkwardly placed.  </li>
            <li> I was forced to use a manual toothbrush till this one came in the mail and my teeth felt dirty even though I just had a dental cleaning!!  </li>
            <li> This toothbrush is very expensive</li>
            <li> /&gt;So, all in all, a terrible product with horrible irritating features that I would never ever waste my money on again.  </li>
            <li> but this one is fairly impossible to access without ruining the handle.</li>
            <li> should this one ever go bad.  </li>
            <li> should this one ever go bad.  </li>
            <li> BUT, this toothbrush isn&#x27;t all bad...</li>
            <li> so maybe I just had bad luck and got a \\&quot;lemon\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> It also reduces halotosis (for those who are too embarrased to admit they have bad breath).  </li>
            <li> bad for 11 years of uses).  </li>
            <li> I find this annoying, especially late at night when I&#x27;m trying to not disturb my housemates.&lt;br</li>
            <li> For the price I am surely disappointed in the OralB</li>
            <li> After a lot of research I choose these brushes and was not at all disappointed.</li>
            <li> now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am extremely disappointed to throw $100 on this oral B.....</li>
            <li> Very unhappy to have to deal with all of it.  </li>
            <li> So very disappointing.</li>
            <li> charging base can be kept separate from the brush head holder.</li>
            <li> SO annoying.  </li>
            <li> All the parts (toothbrush, wireless guide, recharge base, etc.) are branded \\&quot;Braun\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> included stand works well to keep the base unit upright and charging.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, the minerals will accumulate around the base, and the pressure sensor will break.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I HATE that button and will probably try to remove it or disable it.  </li>
            <li> The chsrging base being the biggest change.</li>
            <li> but i dont like the charging adapter and charging base</li>
            <li> The toothbrush is kept in the base</li>
            <li> The hole in the base to accommodate the charger is deeper and the toothbrush leaves toothpaste rings no matter</li>
            <li> Went on vacation for 7 days and did NOT need the charging base.</li>
            <li> I hate flossing</li>
            <li> idiots at Braun.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had one for years and hated to deal with all the bacterial sludge that built up inside of it.  </li>
            <li> WHY i hated it..</li>
            <li> /&gt;I would say that unless you are very bad at brushing your teeth and need a &#x27;nanny&#x27; to tell you what to do every step of the way, then buy a cheaper model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> If you purchase this toothbrush, you will not be disappointed!</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Nasty,</li>
            <li> She was very disappointed and after receiving one of these for Christmas this year myself, I can see why!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really annoying!!</li>
            <li> I hope this comment will save others from having the horrible experience of Braun customer support (and Oral-B&#x27;s</li>
            <li> I like the brush, but the directions sent with them we horrible.  </li>
            <li> While I am a fan of the toothbrush, Oral B as a company has terrible support.  </li>
            <li> AWFUL!!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I bought this as a replacement for an older model with the actual battery level display. It eventually broke after repeated drops from where I set it after brushing. Was unsure about the newer version since it had a different charging block and a different battery display, but it&#x27;s just as nice if not nicer. Has a few more features, like longer brushing etc... I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I was a past owner of two Sonicare toothbrushes for ten years and decided to change it up. The Oral-B feels more like a dentist cleaning and love the different settings incorporated into it. Cleaning of the toothbrush is easier and actually can change out the battery once it goes bad. I have owned it for two months thus far and love it! Highly recommend over Sonicare.</li>
            <li> I have to give it a 1 star  because these people are crooks.. I have sent My Mail in rebate form/application and I Know I did everything right as I used to fill out mail-in-rebate form for other people when I was doing retail. So these crooks cannot say I did it wrong.. they are just bandits and trying to keep every penny in their pocket .. enjoy your product but do not expect to get a mail-in-rebate money....  shame on you ....and I do not care if anybody find my review not helpful because I do not care.. Other than that the product is great ..My mouth feels cleaner and I feel more comfortable talking to people cuz I know my breath is not kicking as it used to be lol...dirty mouth?  get an electric brush!!</li>
            <li> Toothbrush is great. I went ahead and bought the more expensive model with the digital wireless timer. I figured if nothing else it was still a clock. After using it now for 6 months I find that I use the digital timer and it is extremely helpful. I highly recommend the toothbrush WITH THE TIMER..... it is worth it</li>
            <li> I really feel like my mouth is cleaner after using my $20 Oral B. I only bought this one for my husband because he loved my toothbrush so much. It was around Father&#x27;s Day so I got him the fancy one. Well, I tried his and we both agree that mine is better. Don&#x27;t spend the extra money!</li>
            <li> My Experience:  I have had my Oral B 5000 for about a year now.  I was going to review it soon after I bought it, but decided to wait because in my opinion, the real worth of a toothbrush of this nature is shown after using if for quite a while.  Let me just tell you, it works just as good now as it did the day I bought it.  I have extremely sensitive teeth and going to the dentist used to hurt due to all the scraping they had to do on my teeth.  Since I have been using this brush, I have had two cleanings and both times they did minimal scraping and it was actually a pleasant experience.  My teeth are so much whiter and my whole mouth really just feels better!  I buy my brush heads on Amazon for about half the price than what other stores offer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Clock:  I didn&#x27;t think I would use this feature as much as I do.  I mounted it to my bathroom mirror when I got it using the tape that is so conveniently provided.  I use it on a daily basis to keep up with time as I get ready for the day.  The pressure feature on the clock is amazing! I never realized that I brushed too hard and this thing has really gotten me into better brushing habits.  My favorite part, if you brush for 2:30 the smiley face winks at you. ;)  Since I have had the toothbrush, I have only changed the battery in the clock one time.  It has a battery meter on the front to let you know when it&#x27;s getting low.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Battery:  When it was brand new, the battery lasted ~10 days as advertised.  Now (roughly 12 months later), the batter lasts about half that time.  It&#x27;s really not that big of a deal to me because I store my toothbrush on the dock anyway, so I just have to plug it in a little more often.  The battery display on the toothbrush is always extremely accurate and lets me know right when I need to plug it in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:  The carrying case is perfect - I love that it holds multiple brush heads.  The power cord has a piece of Velcro attached to it for easy storage.  The toothbrush head tray has a cover that folds down to keep dust and other random things off it it; this is wonderful for my inner germophobe.  The tray the brush heads sit in is also angled down so that any extra water doesn&#x27;t just sit on the bristles and they dry much faster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:  The only thing I could possibly say negatively about this toothbrush is the lack of instruction that comes with it.  While brushing your teeth is by no means rocket science, this toothbrush has tons of fantastic features and it would be very helpful if someone told you how to do it.  I figured it out after toying with it for a while, but I shouldn&#x27;t have to do that when paying $150 for a toothbrush (thankfully, it has come down in price since I purchased).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this helps.  If you have questions, please ask!rush head tray has a cover that folds down to keep dust and other random things off it it; this is wonderful for my inner germophobe.

            <li> Feels like I just walked out of the dentist office after having my teeth professionally cleaned.  My every expectation was fulfilled with this toothbrush.  Don&#x27;t know how you can improve on this toothbrush . . .</li>
            <li> I have never used an electric tooth brush. Wow what a very nice improvement. my teeth are cleaner , gums are much tighter and this unit is easy to use . Thanks</li>
            <li> recommended, easy to use, arrives as requested, great price, battery works perfectly and manuals and accesories are ok.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;please full charge before use</li>
            <li> My husband and I purchased two Oral-B Professional Healthy Clean + Floss Action Precision 5000 Rechargeable Electric Toothbrushes and couldn&#x27;t be happier.  We use the floss action and pro-white brushing heads.  We&#x27;ve tried many toothbrushes over the years, including the expensive one the dentist insisted we needed to purchase because my husband suffers from gum disease.  None of the toothbrushes we&#x27;ve ever used can even come close to the cleaning power of this toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have always been lectured from dentists for brushing too hard in one particular location - where I always start brushing first.  They said it&#x27;s because I have more energy when I start and am more aggressive.  This has caused my gum to recede down from my teeth in that spot.  I have had to have enamel replaced in that location twice.  Now that I use this brush, it will never be a problem again.  You don&#x27;t apply any pressure and you don&#x27;t use any brushing motion.  The toothbrush does ALL the work for you.  You just move from tooth to tooth slowly for perfectly clean teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let&#x27;s be honest, everyone at one time or another has eaten something and then immediately brushed their teeth only to feel that there are some residual food particles in and between their teeth.  Well, not with this brush.  The power of those 40,000 pulsations per minute and 8,800 oscillations per minute will get out even the most stubborn particles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We have always brushed for about five minutes with other brushes and actually balked at the two minute brushing time recommended with this brush.  Well, truth be told, our teeth and gums look and feel much cleaner with two minutes of use with this brush than five minutes with any other brush.  You actually feel like you just had your teeth cleaned at the dentist every time you brush! I&#x27;m not kidding. We also notice our teeth are getting whiter without any special treatment or whitening toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The unit has five brushing modes to choose from (Daily Clean, Deep Clean, Sensitive, Whitening, and Massage) and even tells you when you&#x27;re brushing too hard.  My husband came rushing out of the bathroom this morning to inform me that the unit gave him a sad face because he was brushing too hard.  LOL  The first few brushes it was a little difficult getting used to timed brushing by quadrant, but now I couldn&#x27;t brush any other way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smart guide (battery operated electric device you can mount on the wall that times you, lets you see what settings you&#x27;re using, which quadrant you&#x27;re supposed to be on, etc.) that comes with each brush can be programmed easily for two different brushes, which is really convenient.  Now we have a spare unit should this one ever go bad.  You get 20 brushes per full charge (10 days - 2x per day).  The first charge took about 24 hours, but after that it seems to charge fully in about 8 hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We both highly recommend this product.  The price seems a bit steep at first (compared to traditional brushes) but the clean you get is incomparable.

            <li> This toothbrush is amazing. It&#x27;s the first professional toothbrush that I have owned.  I used to use an electric Spinbrush, but the difference is incredible.  My teeth feel so much cleaner after using this.</li>
            <li> If the box is opened, containing the toothbrush AND to locate the manual, you discover that it is not advisable to use if you wear a pacemaker within six inches of the brush and of course referring to the packing list it cannot be returned if the package is opened. Therefor I cannot use it because of my pacemaker and since I opened the package to learn this, I&#x27;m not allowed to return it. I wish that sellers would let you know this limitation of pacemaker restrictions before you purchase the brush and the brushes that accompany the item.</li>
            <li> I bought this on a lighting deal for $75.  We absolutely love it.&lt;br /&gt;There are many options of brush replacements available.  We tried a generic (just over $2 per brush head here at Amazon) and it worked just as well as the one that came with it.  Yes, only one brush head came with it, despite the holder having place for four.  That is the only complaint I have.&lt;br /&gt;My teeth have never felt this clean before (other than leaving the dentists office.)  I have added it to my basket because when and if I can get it for that price again, I&#x27;m buying a second one for the kids bathroom.</li>
            <li> awsome brush with timer to keep me honest and maximize my smiles full potential cant wait to show off the smile this well give me.</li>
            <li> Love it.  I&#x27;ve been told many times by the dentist that I brush too hard, this remedied that problem.  Timer works well, battery lasts about a week on a single charge, and the best argument, no cavities and I was complimented by the hygienist.</li>
            <li> My teeth feel so clean when I am finished brushing. Ihave a had this for a year now battery is still awesome and works great.</li>
            <li> This is a great toothbrush set. I can feel my teeth being cleaner after using it.  The biggest thing that I don&#x27;t like about it is how expensive the replacement heads are.</li>
            <li> I chose this model because of the rating,and was not disappointed.  It is such a pleasure to use that I exceed even the extended timed cycle.  There is an easy to see red warning light to let you know when you&#x27;re brushing too hard.  I&#x27;ve used battery operated toothbrushes in the past but this one is far more powerful and the options offer much more flexibility.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only minus was the battery compartment door was installed crooked and was very difficult to remove.  All in all, a minor problem.</li>
            <li> This is a phenomenal toothbrush -- a real keeper -- but had to return mine because the accompanying digital display was D.O.A. ... dead on arrival, despite installation of new batteries to replace those that came with the unit. I tried getting a replacement directly from Oral B under warranty but that was a fool&#x27;s errand: incredibly, in 2013, Oral B&#x27;s Customer Service Rep actually told me to send the unit to an authorized repair center at my expense. So back it goes to Amazon (no charge for return shipping, thank you, Amazon), to be replaced by what I hope will be a brush as effective as this one but without the frustration of D.O.A. electronics and the accompanying D.O.A. customer service.</li>
            <li> Overall, an excellent product.  Great build quality, power and battery life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The remote clock and timer is surprisingly useful.  Nice just to have a small clock in the bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Luckily the large stand build to accommodate several different brush heads can be removed, so the brushes standing profile is as small as with previous products.</li>
            <li> Best investment I ever did.  I was worried about the price, but once I used it I can feel the difference between manual and the oral b</li>
            <li> This review is for the Triumph 5000 but applies to Oral-B&#x27;s other high-end Triumph brushes since my partner and I previous owned a different model:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using Triumph toothbrushes for several years now and I love it. It isn&#x27;t heavy or bulky. It vibrates every 30 seconds to let you know you can do another part of your mouth (i.e., top row/front side, top row/back side, etc.). I think the included LCD screen is unnecessary and clutters the bathroom counter so I retired it years ago. The replacement brush heads are a little pricey but only need replacement every several months (I always use the flossing kind).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s hard to sing the praises of a toothbrush so I will let the proof be in the pudding:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to have cavities every time I went to the dentist. Then I started using the Triumph brush and I have NOT HAD ONE CAVITY SINCE!</li>
            <li> it works wonderful and my teeth feel as clean as when I go to the dentist. I love the clock also and it lets me properly brush my teeth</li>
            <li> I did a lot of research before purchasing this, so I am fairly confident that it will work well and it does.</li>
            <li> Great Toothbrush.  You will be happy you bought this product and your teeth will be happy too!!&lt;br /&gt;See my review at Epinion.com.  You may have to copy and past into your browser:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[...]</li>
            <li> I read through many of the low reviews on this and I just don&#x27;t agree with any of them.&lt;br /&gt; As far as  complaints of the batteries not lasting long:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have proof that the way one cares for their electric toothbrush battery will determine how long the battery will live.&lt;br /&gt;Two exact toothbrushes,...Two examples:&lt;br /&gt;Years ago I bought myself an Oral-B Triumph.  I only put my toothbrush on the charger when it needed a charge,  and I only left it on the charger until it was fully charged.  The charger then went into the drawer.  When the battery got really low,  I put it back on the charger and removed from charger after it was fully charged.  About once a month,  I let the brush run completely out of batteries while running,  and then  I recharged it in full, then removed from charger.&lt;br /&gt; That toothbrush lasted for years and years and I just now replaced it with the 5000.  I am treating the 5000 exactly the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After having bought the Triumph for myself,  a couple  years later I bought the same toothbrush for my husband.  My husband would not listen to my advice,  and he insisted on returning the toothbrush onto the charger after each use.  The toothbrush lived on the charger when not in use.  His toothbrush did not last nearly as long as mine did,  and mine was older than his was.&lt;br /&gt;So when I see complaints about the battery life,  I have to ask myself how the reviewer took care of his battery.  ?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The review/complaint about the tooth breaking is just plain questionable.  Did he/she bang the hard plastic on their tooth?  I do not see how&lt;br /&gt;anyone could break their tooth with this toothbrush unless they were totally mishandling it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have only had my 5000 for a little over a week now,  so I cannot comment on battery life as yet,  but I will say that I believe this 5000 is a nice improvement over the Triumph,  and I loved that toothbrush too.&lt;br /&gt;I really like the remote smily guy that monitors brushing time and whether you&#x27;re pushing too hard with the tooth brush.  I do actually use this feature and it keeps me on track  with the section timing of my teeth.  I always go over the two minutes and brush more like four.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other point that I would like to make here is that this particular toothbrush is considered the very best by our dentist and probably as well as most dentists out there.  I have had a Sonicare before and did not care for it at all.  It is my opinion that the shape of the teeth and gums require a rounded smaller  toothbrush,  especially when brushing the insides of the teeth. After all teeth  are curved one way on the outside and the opposite on the inside.  Only a round brush seems logical to me.&lt;br /&gt;The toothbrushes with the little yellow rubber bristles are the best and get the teeth much cleaner than the brushes without them!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Excellent electric toothbrush! 5+ stars!nd whether you&#x27;re pushing too hard with the tooth brush.

            <li> Veeery good product. I never go back to traditional brushes. It performs excellently and the remote indicator is so cool</li>
            <li> Love the sequence timer.  Leaves teeth feeling super!! Haven&#x27;t taken the time to use the remote yet.  Will get around to one of these days.</li>
            <li> This is my first electric brush. My Dental Office had been suggesting I purchase this model to improve my situation. They explained this product could brush better than I could manually. The way the brushhead moves is more effective, and I can see this is true.&lt;br /&gt;My oral state is not stable, it&#x27;s been declining.  Plaque was causing gum loss, and some bleeding. In a few days, I can tell my teeth and gums show improvement from better cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The electric brush appears well thought out, and well made. A choice of intensity seems good for sensitivity. It took approx. 12hrs for the initial charge. There are several brushhead types made by OralB that will work with this. Only (1) is included, and it seems fine for my purposes. After determining I was satisfied with this style brushhead I&#x27;ve ordered more. Non-OralB brushheads will void the device warranty if they cause damage to the electric brush. The digital timer is ok, but not really an important feature to me. It can be ignored or not used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have gum or teeth problems, the cost of this brush and additional brushheads is small. I&#x27;ve paid much more than the cost of this device for surgery on my gums and related dental visits. With your mouth, you can&#x27;t get back what you&#x27;ve lost. You can only hope to stabilize the condition. I recommend this brush, it&#x27;s a worthwhile investment.</li>
            <li> I have recently been using this Oral B electric toothbrush after having owned a Sonicare as well. This tooth brush just does not compare. The round head is bulky in my small mouth and I have a difficult time reaching all the spots I need to in order to ensure the perfect clean. The shape of the Sonicare brush head is way better to reach in the back and on the sides of those hard to reach area. I would recommend the Sonicare over the Oral-B Professional Healthy Clean + Floss Action</li>
            <li> I splurged and bought this, but hey its for your health so who cares. It is kind of expensive though, I feel like I could have gone for a cheaper one with the same results. It is kind of loud. It splashes all over the place and when I put it in the dock to charge it drips so my mirror and my counter top constantly have toothpaste on it now. Note to the inexperienced, having all these different modes doesn&#x27;t make a difference. They are almost all the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a positive note though, I really do feel like my teeth get cleaner than they ever have before. So I am overall happy with the purchase. I really like the timer too!!!!</li>
            <li> The brush works very well. My mouth feels very clean after every use, with very little effort. I would&#x27;ve given this brush a perfect score if the battery life was better. I find that it takes around 24 hours for a full charge, and it discharges rather quickly.</li>
            <li> I had the previous version of this toothbrush but felt that they could improve on a couple of things. The first was the rubber feet at the bottom of the handle. After so many uses and drying with a towel it began to peel off. This was improved on this version. The material at base of this one seems better made. The old version seemed to glued on. The new version the rubber seems to be built into the handle. Great improvement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They also put a faster motor in the latest version. I can tell a difference in the brushing speed. The one thing I don&#x27;t like is the charging time. When I&#x27;m down to one square and plug it up for recharging it takes the whole day to fully charge. I don&#x27;t keep it plugged in as I&#x27;m worried about battery life over the life span of the toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m happy with the improvements. I think it&#x27;s worth upgrading too. The look is new and there&#x27;s more minor improvements that were made that you can read about.</li>
            <li> As I am getting older, iI am quite concerned with preserving my teeth.  I read so many reviews before deciding which unit to purchase. I feel as though I made the right choice!  My family found the clock amusing.  However, I find the clock to be a good tool!  I never realized how long I should actually be brushing my teeth!  My two minutes and this clocks two minutes sure do differ!  Also, it is nice to have a clock in the bathroom and it doesn&#x27;t take up much space.  It would be better if it had a small backlight though.  The battery in this unit holds a charge for at least a week.  One word of caution, my initial charge took about 24 hours! I was about to give up hope.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I used the toothbrush I noticed such a difference in the cleanliness of my teeth!  It felt as though I had left the dentist office.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As someone who travels frequently, I also really like that this unit came with a case for the toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I like the Oral B Healthy Clean.  Only wish it were a little easier to program the timer.  I also wish they would have a setting where you can choose and stay on which ever brushing style you want.  Then if you want to change to another style, just push that setting and not have to choose the setting you want each time you brush your teeth.  Good value for the money and lasts longer than Sonic toothbrushes.  They seem to expire and offer you nothing extra after the warranty expires (other than 15% off).  We are much happier with the Oral B company.</li>
            <li> Works better than described. It&#x27;s more powerful than I planned. My teeth feel like I just left the dentist. Worth the money.</li>
            <li> Best toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever bought.  My teeth are whiter and feel as clean as when I go to the dentist.  Great checkups from now on!</li>
            <li> I used to own the older version of this toothbrush and loved it. It does do a great job. Products are supposed to be better with the newer version but this one takes a step back. The charger that comes with the new version is 110v which is ironic considering it comes with a travel case. I called oralb customer service to check if they had some sense of sending me a dual voltage charger but they said you can return the product if that is an option. So bad product revision and poor customer service.</li>
            <li> This Oral -B toothbrush was recommended to me and it certainly does a great job. Thanks for offering it for sale</li>
            <li> The wireless timer may be a gimmick, but some gimmicks may be helpful. In particular, this timer offers some confidence to parents whose kids are gradually moving toward fully independent brushing. If the brush is only used for thirty seconds instead of two minutes, the LCD will show that fact (not sure for how long, but it &amp;#34;sticks&amp;#34; afterwards long enough for the next person at the sink to see). If it shows 2:05, that&#x27;s no guarantee that brushing technique was ideal, but it&#x27;s at least one reassurance that good habits are taking hold. For that matter, if I myself am rushed and tempted to skimp on brushing time, having a little electronic &amp;#34;note&amp;#34; of that fact is a slight nudge towards just being patient. I find the 30-second interval reminders to be helpful, too; it enables me to approach brushing almost like a relaxed meditation on each quadrant.</li>
            <li> Have several generations of this electrical tooth brush. In this incarnation Oral-B have decided that users need a more clear &amp;#34;signal&amp;#34; when to change which teeth are getting brushed. The problem is that this version of the tooth brush makes a small &amp;#34;pause&amp;#34; every 30 seconds. Its quite annoying if you are used to a continuous movement even if its probably no more than 1 second. Not sure I would have bought it if I had known.</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush system.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been skeptical about powered toothbrushes because of their high cost and asked my dentist who said it was matter of personal preference between the standard toothbrush and powered. I continued to use my standard. Then, after having a cavity filled after a checkup only 2 weeks earlier, my dentist noted surprise at build up in the short time since she had last seen me. That among other reasons resulted in this purchase, and I was really amazed at the difference now that I am using this powered toothbrush. I did some research and chose this one based on Amazon reviews, and now that I&#x27;m using it, my teeth seem as clean as they do after my bi-annual cleaning and polishing. In my last dentist visit, they say all looks really good, a positive sign. Despite the &amp;#34;Floss Action&amp;#34; in the description, you still need to floss as usual. The travel case is actually very convenient. My husband and I share this and have different brushing heads, and the case accommodates two different brushes, so we can use it when traveling together. For the timer that comes along with this, I use it because I tend to want to finish sooner than the recommended time allotment (2 minutes) so the timer actually makes me persevere (sometimes), but my husband pays no attention to it. I would recommend to friends and family.</li>
            <li> Used these for years, but battery will only hold a good charge for about 2 years.  But hygienist says it cleans my teeth well.</li>
            <li> Product seems great when cleaning, but the batteries die SUPER fast. It is a Ni-Mh, but I expected it to last at least a year or so of constant use before it showed signs of battery fatigue. Other then the battery though, this works great!</li>
            <li> Up to now, this is the best. I recommend this line to everyone. Oral-B is keeping its standard of quality.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this brand of electric toothbrush for years.  The battery eventually wears out and I ordered the latest model. But for the first time, the new charger ONLY works in the US.  If you travel a lot and need a multi-voltage charger (110v-220v), you are out of luck.  I don&#x27;t know why they made this change but it makes the device useless for me.  Odd when all cellphone, computer,etc. electronics chargers are all multi-voltage nowadays.</li>
            <li> One of the best toothbrushes I have ever owned. This thing does it all and the digital timer greatly helps</li>
            <li> Bought this toothbrush to replace my previous Oral-B Professional one that the battery died on and find it to be even better at providing a great brushing experience and leaving my mouth feeling super clean.</li>
            <li> Love it!! Had the previous version and loved it and this does as good or better work. Your teethe feel really clean all the way to the gum. My dentist always complements my dental hygiene.</li>
            <li> Took a little getting used to the vibration.  But now after a month I can tell gums are feeling better and looking better.&lt;br /&gt;Also using less toothpaste.  Have found I really dont need so many speed variations, but they are nice to have.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush gave my teeth a very good cleaning.  Every time I used it, I felt my teeth were extremely clean.  However, after about a year of use. My toothbrush won&#x27;t recharge.  I found out that I can&#x27;t change the batteries unless I want to use a soldering tool which I&#x27;m unfamiliar with.  So ultimately, I feel I&#x27;ve been ripped off. There should be some information that tells the customer that this &amp;#34;rechargeable&amp;#34; battery does lose it&#x27;s life and you can&#x27;t recharge it.  This toothbrush is very expensive and I know I don&#x27;t have the money to replace the whole thing each year.</li>
            <li> Bought this as a replacement for one my husband has had since 2007. I had to convince him to try it because he was sure nothing could replace his &amp;#34;old faithful&amp;#34;! Now, I have his old one which I use for my jewelry cleaning and it works great, now we&#x27;re both delighted!</li>
            <li> I got 4 sets as gifts but two of them out of order when my friend opened them from the package.</li>
            <li> This has been a wonderful toothbrush.  The timer helping you to brush in each quadrant of your mouth to make sure you cover all areas is a great idea.  It really does an outstanding job of cleaning your teeth.  This is the best brush I have ever had.  Everyone should have and use it.  Thanks.</li>
            <li> Forget the Sonicare.  I&#x27;ve had one for years and hated to deal with all the bacterial sludge that built up inside of it.  Nasty, and I think it contributed to giving me bacterial derived gum recession.  If that sounds appealing then get a Sonicare.  This brush feels great, less intense than a Sonicare, and the head moves as well as vibrates.... very cool.  Virtually no cleaning to do and the heads snap on smooth as silk.  I couldn&#x27;t be happier with this brush... just wish I had switched to it years ago.  Buy one.</li>
            <li> I have been a user of Braun electric toothbrushes for 20 years, ever since the first generation.  Except for the second generation, there are positive improvements in each generation of the product.  However, this latest generation has regressed.  I suspect that this is to save on production cost.  To me, the previous generation,  the Triumph model (Triumph Professional Care 9000) is the best of the lot and I wish I can still buy them.  The short-comings of this present model compared to the previous are    1) single voltage charger    The charger is now single voltage which means that I have to bring along a voltage transformer when I travel.  Who wants this?    2) long charging time    For the previous Triumph model, I can charge a completely drained toothbrush in about 12 hours.  Now it takes 24 hours.  This is a serious setback when I do not have time to charge the toothbrush, e.g. while traveling.    3) short battery life    My previous model which is a couple of years old can go for almost 2 weeks before it needs to be re-charged.  This model can last only about 8 days.  Again, this is a problem when you do not have access to power.    4) lack of proper display    Braun has removed the LCD display from this model.  Without the external Smart Guide, there is no way to tell how long have you been brushing your teeth.  Also, the pause, every 30 seconds, is long and is exceedingly irritating.  The long interruption disrupts smooth brushing of the teeth.    5) blinking LED while charging    Due to the absence of the LCD panel, the charging progress is indicated by blinking LED lights.  This is the method used by a previous generation of toothbrush.  After a while, the LED lights will wear out and stop blinking.  When this happens, there is no way to tell whether the toothbrush is charging and when it has a full charge.    I hope that Braun would take notice of these short-comings and bring back the previous generation of Trimph toothbrush.    +++++++++++++++++++Update - 1/31/2015    One and a half year later, the battery is now gone.  It would not hold the charge.  I spend 1 whole day charging it up and only get to use the toothbrush for 2 days before the battery is totally discharged.  Worse still, the red low charge light does not come on, so I am left with a mouthful of foam when the battery suddenly died.    Since I am rotating this toothbrush with my older Triumph which is still going strong, this means that the battery would have lasted less than 1 year if I am using this toothbrush exclusively.    I tried to open up the toothbrush to dispose of the battery, but the white cap at the bottom of the handle would not come off. I contacted the P&amp;G customer service and asked them how to remove the cap.  I was told to be a responsible consumer and dispose of the battery properly.  How am I suppose to be responsible when I cannot remove the battery?  This product really sucks.    Can anybody suggest an alternative product?    ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++    Update - 3/2/2015    Since my last update I have bought a    [[ASIN:B002HWS9FW Oral-B Pro-Health Precision Clean Battery Toothbrush, 1 Count]]    and is using it with a Floss Action brush head.  This battery toothbrush is powerful enough to drive the Floss Action brush head adequately.  It may be slightly slower than the Precision buy not very noticable.  The Duracell batteries that comes with the set is still going strong after almost a month.  I plan to use rechargable batteries after this.    Don&#x27;t waste your money on the more expensive Precision models.  Get this battery model!</li>
            <li> I had 2 electronic toothbrush before this one , however this is the best I have ever used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many modes&lt;br /&gt;Portable screen that will till you when is the time to stop( if you want ) and will register your times of using it .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like it</li>
            <li> Love that this has several speed/setting.  Nothing to complain about this power toothbrush! just wish it came with not just one brush head.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the toothbrush.  My teeth have never felt so clean.  Very little of anything left between my teeth when I floss following use.</li>
            <li> The Oral-B Professional makes my teeth feel just from the dentist clean.  I use the clock.  Glad I paid the additional for that.</li>
            <li> I love this tooth brush. It&#x27;s exactly what I was looking for. I wanted something with a timer for each section of my mouth but that was fun. The little smiley face on the timer is fun and the brush beeps after 30 seconds or 45, depending on what brushing cycle you chose, then after your brushing time is up it doesn&#x27;t just shut off which is great! You have 5 different brushing methods to choose from 2 min or 3 min, feather and polish and one other. It last for about 10 days without needing to be charged again. I go out of town a bunch so this is awesome. I did want bristles that where longer like a do it yourself toothbrush but am very happy I tried it anyways because I really quite like what it came with. The floss action brushes are kinda cool.</li>
            <li> This the best of all oral b&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;It deep cleans and yet does it gently. It is actually fun to use.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I like the Oral-B 5000 toothbrush.  I bought per my dentist&#x27; recommendation for my sensitive gums.  It works much better than the under-$20 Oral-B vitality with a regular brush head.  It is a must to read the entire instruction manual before using the toothbrush.  Fortunately, the instructions are not long and they seemed readable to me.  It may be daunting if you avoid all instruction booklets like the plague.  If that is so, buy a low-tech toothbrush like the Oral-B vitality or a plain toothbrush.  The toothbrush system has settings for sensitive gums, deep clean, normal clean, whitening and massage mode.  The digital device, which connects wirelessly to the brush, tells you if you are brushing too hard, when to change tooth quadrants, mode and when you are done.  It can be mounted to a wall or mirror.  There is a holder for four brushes. It came with the Crest/Oral-B Clinical Gingivitis System kit that I purchased from my dentist for $125.  The kit came with extras like four different brush heads, full tube Crest Pro-Health toothpaste/mouthwash and Oral-B flossing tape.  Even if your dentist does not sell the kit, I recommend this toothbrush for folks who need flexibility and/or have special needs.</li>
            <li> This is by far the most powerful and advanced wireless toothbrush I have owned.  In less than two minutes I&#x27;m able to clean my entire mouth.  The Professional line has various toothbrush options for just about any of your oral hygiene needs.  In my opinion this model is fantastic!  Other makes and models pale in comparison.  It was a very worthwhile purchase that I hope will last for a very long time.</li>
            <li> I was given this toothbrush for christmas by my father.  At first I didn&#x27;t know why he got it for me because I was very happy with my Sonicare toothbrush that I&#x27;ve been using for about 10 years now.  I also had some previous experience with the cheaper versions of the Oral B electric toothbrushes that are designed more for travel which I didn&#x27;t care for at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I loved my Sonicare for years and years.  I loved the soft bristles on there and I thought that was the best of the best when it came to electric toothbrushes.  Because he got it for me I figured I should give it a shot and see how it compared.  I paired it up with the &amp;#34;whitening&amp;#34; brush head he also got me and I tried it out.  I programed the digital clock portion that came with and started it up.  It was miraculous.  After that first brushing I was left with the same feeling I get when I leave my dentists office.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m one who goes to the dentist every 6 months for checkups, brush twice a day and floss twice a day so I keep good dental habits, but between dentist checkups I have a tendency to have really severe staining even though I&#x27;m not very much of a coffee, tea, or soda drinker.  After about a weeks worth of using the whitening brush head paired with the whitening setting on the brush itself my teeth were noticeably whiter now than they&#x27;ve ever been, and having used it regularly for a month or so now they look almost as good as when I leave the doctors chair.</li>
            <li> Happy Camper says this is just the best way to brush teeth - period. Follow the instructions and your teeth will feel just like the best cleaning you get at the dentist. I am 62 and just started using Oral-b 5000 and I really like it. Should have started using this 50 years ago.</li>
            <li> It is my second Oral B-5000. I prefer it over the Philip Sonicare that I tried for 2 months. At the end of the day, it is a tooth brush and come down to personal preference. To me, it is everything and I am sure my next one will be oral B-5000 or newer version.</li>
            <li> I bought this after wanting to upgrade from my old electric toothbrush and my fiance has since stolen it and is using it as his own. It works a treat and leaves ur teeth feeling dentist clean!!</li>
            <li> We like our new toothbrush a lot.  It helps me get the back of my bottom front teeth much more effectively (because of the small head and the movement).  I&#x27;m hoping it will make my next dental cleaning much quicker, since that is always a hard area to keep pristine.  It also seems to work ok behind my wisdom teeth (a very tight place).  I like the sensor that tells you when you&#x27;re brushing too hard.  At first, I thought the timer function was a pointless thing, but I have found that I actually do like it.  It makes me feel that I have to give the teeth a full brushing, even when I am in a hurry to get to bed at night (it keeps me from cheating my teeth out of a full brushing).  Overall a good product.  Battery life has been good.  I find I need to charge it just short of a week after a full charge (that is with my husband and me both using it twice a day).  This is not a problem at all.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love my Oral-B electric toothbrush!  The results are much better than manual brushing.  My teeth feel cleaner...polished and my gums seem healthier.  Even my dental hygienist commented on the improvement just the other day.  The Smart Guide allows the brush to pause every 30 seconds per quadrant to ensure that I brush long enough.  Worth the investment for dental health!&lt;br /&gt;KLB</li>
            <li> The battery does not hold charge for long enough. It starts out giving strong brushing action, but after 2-4 uses, it drops and then it needs recharging again after a few days.</li>
            <li> We have had an oral b electric tooth brush for years but felt it was slowing down so we purchased this new Oral B Professional &amp; Healthy clean + unit.  We are delighted with the performance and the way it makes your teeth feel.  I actually enjoy and look forward to using this product every day.  The five different settings, and even the little &amp;#34;smiley&amp;#34; monitor make it a complete system for great oral hygiene.  I am looking forward to my next dental appointment to see how the plague has been reduced and the color enhanced in my teeth.  My wife even had some stains on her teeth and they have totally disappeared.  An excellent product that I would definitely purchase again and have recommended to everyone in our family.</li>
            <li> We now own two of these two brushes.  I really like being able to track how long my son brushes and like the multiple ways the toothbrush detects too much brushing pressure.  I have gum recession and need to be very careful.  It comes with a nice travel case.  The only negative is that it has slightly less battery life than my previous lower end Oral-B tooth brush.</li>
            <li> My old Oral-B was no longer holding a charge very long but I just kept plugging it in...  Then when it seemed like it was finally failing I bought the Precision 5000.  As well as this brush works I should have dumped my old one a long time ago!</li>
            <li> My wife and I are extremely impressed by the power this thing has. I soon. am looking forward to what my hygienist says</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed when my older Oral B toothbrush died and since it only lasted 2-3 yrs I hesitated to purchase another from them. I tend to scrub my teeth and have gum erosion which is not good, so I bit the bullet and bought the newest model. The new version has been tweaked and they are all for the best. Before if I was brushing too hard the clock/ monitor would flash a small red light, however I tend to be half asleep when I brush and missed the notice. The new toothbrush has lights on the handle that you can see out of the corner of your eye and in the mirror. The kids feel that it brushes faster and more firmly than the other model and since they use a copy of the older model when they visit their father I think it isn&#x27;t just wishful thinking. Your teeth feel like you just got them cleaned at the dentist after you brush at home and the dentist says I am doing a great job, so I know it works.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush has strong action and feels like it does a great job. The brush heads are unique, and seem more customized to teeth. Out of the 5 brush modes, I&#x27;ve used regular (2 min), plus (3 min), and gum (gentle). The remote display is fun, and kind of motivating. Heck, it&#x27;s even got an iPhone app. Strong recommendation.</li>
            <li> Absolutely fantastic. My teeth have never felt so clean. Holds a charge for about 3 days, then really loses power, when you travel. I loved it so much my wife bought one for herself and she has been equally impressed. Much better quality than cheaper versions our friends tried out.</li>
            <li> Great Toothbrush.  I had previously owned a cheaper Sonic brush, and my dentist strongly recommended that I buy Oral-B since the technology is simply better and more effective - and I agree!  Comfortable to use, and you can tell its worth the money with how effective it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside would be the batteries - They aren&#x27;t great - maybe get 6-8 days of battery life (using 2x a day).  And then, the charging takes more than 12 hours (closer to 24) so you have to interrupt the charge to brush again, or use another brush.  My only previous comparison was the Sonic, and that was a lot longer, but it was also less powerful, so there is a trade off.</li>
            <li> Should have gone this route a long time ago vs manual brushing.... now brushing after every meal is not a chore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sensor they provide doesn&#x27;t really do much except tell the time, honestly.</li>
            <li> I upgraded from a much older model and after a week my teeth feel like I just visited the dentist.</li>
            <li> The design change from a brush to a rubber strip makes this model less effective - an obvious cost cutting move that will result in dissatisfied customers - like me</li>
            <li> Price isn&#x27;t bad and the product is amazing! Unique how this thing times you as you brush your teeth e</li>
            <li> It cleans my teeth amazingly, but you may as well have a gas powered toothbrush with the amount of noise this thing makes.  I woke up the entire neighborhood!  :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But seriously, it&#x27;s loud.</li>
            <li> Always thought electric tooth brushes were silly. Not anymore. Keeps my teeth cleaner then they have ever been. Recommended by my Dentist and now me.</li>
            <li> I loved the product. It does an excellent job cleaning your teeth but it has not even been a year since i bought it and it has died.&lt;br /&gt;Very disappointing. I expected it to last a lot longer than a year.</li>
            <li> This is my second electric toothbrush and I must say I&#x27;m pretty impressed. The deep clean and massage modes were well worth it. There was a significant reduction in plaque after using just the normal mode and the deep cleaning mode came real close to that &amp;#34;just back from the dentist&amp;#34; feel.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush is awesome, the only drawback is that as I travel all the time, I had to buy an additional 220-110V adapter. I was hoping the voltage adapter was universal but it wasn´t, even though the product is german and over there they use 220V. Why do they keep on thinking that th US is the only country in the world?</li>
            <li> i love how it tells you how well you clean your teeth and it works great. will buy again if needed and will tell friends and family to get to use</li>
            <li> Great quality products</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had the unit about 3 months now and love it.  It&#x27;s well built and user friendly.  We&#x27;re using the floss brush heads and are happy with the results.  Hoping my dentist also likes the results when my next teeth cleaning appointment rolls around.  I love having the digital clock on my bathroom mirror.  It&#x27;s a nice practical touch to see the time when the timer is not running while brushing your teeth.  Kids always laugh at the smiley face.</li>
            <li> Love this toothbrush. Bought one for each family member. Replacement heads are expensive but worth the price of healthy teeth and fewer dentists visits. The knockoff heads work well too.</li>
            <li> Bought as a replacement same brand and is very pleased with the upgrades old model was 6+ yrs old and used everyday by 2 adults</li>
            <li> As shown by most reviews, this is a great brush.  Ive had mine for three years and the build quality has been great. The only drawback is that the battery loses its ability to hold a charge over time. After the 3 years, it only lasts for 2 uses before completely dying.  This would be no big deal if the battery was serviceable.  Its possible to buy a replacement, but the process requires dissemble of the brush and use of a soldering iron.  It would have been a simple design decision to make the battery replaceable.</li>
            <li> I had the triumph design for 10 years before it quit on me (it was still trying, just not holding charge and not working w as much umph). I naturally ordered another and hope to get half of what the old one did.</li>
            <li> kinda really loud &amp; noisy.  I can only imagine what my neighbors in my condo think they are hearing. Woohoo.</li>
            <li> To be fair I know nothing about toothbrushes except that I&#x27;ve been using a manual one for my entire life. Finally broke down and splurged and figured I would go big. Does this thing work? Yes. Does it work better than any other brush on the market? No idea. But I can tell you that it&#x27;s a pleasure to brush my teeth for 2 minutes and feel the dentist-clean feeling afterwards. As for settings, who knows if they really do anything, but I&#x27;ll continue to tell myself they do.</li>
            <li> I brush my teeth longer than recommended 2 minutes. I love the clock/timer with its smiley face. The brush stops for a second to let you know that you have cleaned on quarter of your teeth long enough so you may move to another one. I find it very helpful&lt;br /&gt;feature. My teeth fill very clean after use. I love everything about this toothbrush and I would recommend it to everyone.</li>
            <li> Overall, it works and I&#x27;m happy! My teeth def feels cleaner and I&#x27;ve enjoyed brushing more.  However, the timer was kind of unecessary, although pretty cool.</li>
            <li> This came missing a part and didn&#x27;t work.  Very unhappy to have to deal with all of it.  Don&#x27;t have a clue if it is good or not.</li>
            <li> I finally had to replace my old Oral-B after MANY years of excellent cleaning. I like that the extra brush holder isn&#x27;t attached so that it saves room on the counter top. The separate viewing piece isn&#x27;t necessary if you&#x27;re going to pick a favorite speed and stick to it. The brush signals you when each quadrant is done so the viewer isn&#x27;t necessary for that either. I will probably use it until the batteries that came with it run out and then will put it away. I&#x27;m not sure yet how I feel about the Floss Action Brush head. I may choose to get different heads when my brush wears out. It&#x27;s louder than my old one which takes some getting used to. It cleans just as well as the old one and with this new one I do have a choice of speeds (which I didn&#x27;t have before). Your teeth will feel great after using it. My dentist was always saying how clean my teeth were when I&#x27;d go for my oral check-ups. I chalk it up to the rotating head and speed of the Oral-B brush. I expect to continue to get great reviews from the dentist. I am very satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> This is a very advanced way of brushing your teeth.  The tooth brush and support hardware are very impressive in instructing you how to pay attention to each area you are brushing.  Good buy.</li>
            <li> Best tooth brush I have purchased! I saw it at the dentist office, so I searched amazon. It is much cheaper. Definitely recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I use the toothbrush on the highest setting and I really feel my teeth are much cleaner than before.  I had the older version of this toothbrush and used the non oral b replacement heads and felt they did not work as well as the other.  Still a great product.</li>
            <li> Positives:&lt;br /&gt;I like that there is a timer to let you know when each quadrant is done.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s nice it comes with a travel case and the battery seems to last a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Negatives:&lt;br /&gt;I have to use it on the soft speed because the regular is uncomfortable to my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;I have tried brushing my tongue with the round head but it doesn&#x27;t seem to work very well. I would have given it a higher rating if I was able to clean my tongue thoroughly. I am not sure if you need a different brush head or not.&lt;br /&gt;I find that instead of using four quadrants I break it up into two (top and bottom) I find that that works better for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I think this is a pretty good toothbrush. I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s worth all the money compared to a regular toothbrush. Time will tell.</li>
            <li> Just get it. It&#x27;s worth the investment and there is no way you will ever get your teeth as clean with a manual brush or with the half as..Ed electric brushes that vibrate. This brush goes in circles that you can&#x27;t duplicate with a manual brush or the $10.00 or $20.00 brushes in the stores. I have only tried the Oral B so I can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s better or worse than other similar products. I can say I&#x27;ve had mine for over a year with no problems.</li>
            <li> It is about as functional as my last Oral-B.  The stand gets pretty grimy fast, and has to be cleaned weekly.  The display has started to not pick up the brush.  You are standing next to it using the brush, and the display doesn&#x27;t show the elapsed time, mode, etc.  That never happened with the last model.</li>
            <li> I used to have an electric toothbrush when I was younger; hated it.  It was many many years ago, so i&#x27;m not really WHY i hated it.. I i just hated brushing my teeth in general.  I still do... but this toothbrush makes the process a lot less painful.  Only gripe I have is that it&#x27;s $120.. I realized that after I bought this I could have asked my dentist friends to get me one for half the price.  oh well.  this will probably last me the next 5 years so I&#x27;m satisfied</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is simply amazing. I&#x27;ve been using it for several months already and I am very pleased. Battery life is excellent. I love the preasure sensor.</li>
            <li> I have used an oral b for years. The brush heads that come with this are the best I have found.  My old oral b gave out after 8 years.  Hope this one lasts as long.</li>
            <li> I had a older model that died and needed to replace, it was not in stock so bought this unit.  The brush itself is great and nearly identical to what I had.  This display is supposed to communicate with the brush and display time you are brushing, the setting, etc.  But I could never figure out how to operate it, no buttons and no touch display.  The directions were useless.  I ended up throwing the display away!  One of the most stupid designs I have ever seen...</li>
            <li> Fantastic.  I&#x27;ve noticed a big difference in my teeth and gums.  Love that it does a thorough job, fairly quiet and recharges quickly.</li>
            <li> Have used Oral-B before, though it died in less than a year.  This one is easy to handle, has the 4 beeps to indicate when you&#x27;ve finished brushing each quadrant of your mouth, brushing is (so far) effective (certainly more so than a manual brush) and has a traveling case.  I found the gizmo to change the settings to be superfluous as we use only the one setting so never even set it up.</li>
            <li> My wife and I have been using the Oral B from Costco since 2007 and considered it one the best purchases we&#x27;ve ever made. I&#x27;m sure they were the 1,000 series, but I can&#x27;t be certain. Once the batteries started dying after 6 years we looked into upgrading and chose the 5,000 series.  Sure, it&#x27;s pricey, but heck, I&#x27;m worth it... but is the toothbrush?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, the functionality of these devices remains relatively unchanged. You have a power button, and then a selection button that let&#x27;s you change the mode. You also get a slick little LCD clock with a happy face that smiles when you&#x27;re brushing correctly, and frowns when you&#x27;re grinding the enamel off your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The available modes include settings for sensitive teeth, deep cleaning, whitening and just a normal mode for schlubs like me. Switching to the deep cleaning mode is when you begin to think that the emperor might be buck naked.  Instead of the usual 2 minute, 30 seconds per quadrant routine of the normal mode... you simply brush your teeth for 3 minutes, or 45 seconds per quadrant. Gee, I just realized that my old 1,000 series had a deep cleaning mode, too. Come to think of it, the free cheap plastic toothbrush I just got from my dentist has a deep cleaning mode, too. It&#x27;s called \\&quot;Brush your teeth a little longer\\&quot; mode. Brilliant! And they charged extra for this feature... and I paid for it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With our old Oral B&#x27;s my wife and I were always concerned about brushing too hard, as if we might accidentally sand down our bicuspids until they resembled a row of partially dissolved Altoids. Well, our worries are over with the new 5,000! The moment you apply too much pressure a menacing red light activates in the handle, and the smiley face on your LCD clock contorts into a toothless demonic entity whose appearance is so frightening you&#x27;ll drop the toothbrush in fear for your life! OK, a slight exaggeration... but it does frown at you. The annoying part is that we discovered we were neverapplying too much pressure with our old brushes, anyway. You could always tell when you were brushing too hard. The toothbrush motor would slow down from the excessive friction. Duh. With the new 5,000 the motor slows down from the excessive friction just like the 1,000. Just remember, you don&#x27;t get the menacing red light and demonic face with the 1,000 series, but you do save about $40. To summarize, I&#x27;m really glad I sprang for the 5,000 series. The menacing face on my LCD clock is convincing me to feel this way. Uh oh, he heard me... gotta go now. (help me!)</li>
            <li> Love this toothbrush.  It is somewhat smaller than the previous version, so that is a plus.  I like the travel case, now I take this on all my trips.</li>
            <li> My dentist had one sitting out on a shelf. No hard sell-just there to pique curiosity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;oh! to answer the nagging oral hygiene questions...&lt;br /&gt;Do I brush long enough? How do I know how hard to push?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Listen to beeps and/or watch visual display to get back on track brushing correctly 30 sec per quadrant.&lt;br /&gt;Beep in hand and red light pressure alert.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unobtrusive beeps. Won&#x27;t have you or SO on ceiling.&lt;br /&gt;You are rewarded with a happy face after completing all 4 quarters (awww..)&lt;br /&gt;Multiple settings.(soft, firm, pulsating).&lt;br /&gt;Comes with basic pro brush head but other brushes available.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s is easy to get distracted and not spend enough time or get start thinking and spend way too much in one area.&lt;br /&gt;Let this system help you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy to mount (and take away) clock/timer. Nice to have that in bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very easy to clean handle, stand, recharger and brush tray. Small footprint. Non-tippy. Adequate cord.&lt;br /&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;Good battery life..&lt;br /&gt;Kind of dorky blue plastic travel case. Not dorky enough to make me look for a substitute.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Get brushes on Subscribe and Save as reminder when to replace.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have dual voltage that is necessary if you travel to most foreign countries, like the one I had before. This model also takes a longer time to charge. I used to be able to charge my old one overnight. This one takes more like 12 hours.</li>
            <li> The whole clock with the smiley face is a bit unnecessary but more importantly the tooth brush works perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The carry case is also great for packing it into a suitcase worry-free.</li>
            <li> I had an Oral-B electric toothbrush before this one and it lasted for 7 years.  That&#x27;s why I purchased another Oral-B.  I am enjoying the Precision 5000, I really like the timer it comes with, I brush my teeth for the full 2 minutes instead of just 1 minute.  I feel my teeth are super clean and I think I will have great results at my next dental check-up.  I will always buy an Oral-B electronic toothbrush, they are the best!</li>
            <li> My kids were brushing lazily and quickly; it was starting to impact their check ups, so we purchased this, and put the timer up on their mirror.  By encouraging their 2 minute routine, the SmartGuide really helped turn things around very quickly.  I was surprised.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I plugged the charger in and had it on the charger for at least 12 hours.  Instructions say the &amp;#34;lightS&amp;#34; will blink on the handle and will stop blinking when it is fully charged.  only 1 light was blinking and still blinking after 12 hours.  I returned it and got a replacement.  Same thing as the last one.  Not sure if the instructions are wrong or if it is defective, but after a couple weeks, I just decided to keep it.  Has anyone else experienced this???  I&#x27;ve had elec. brushes previously and the lights all stopped blinking when it was charged.  I have yet to try the other features.</li>
            <li> I had been wanting this toothbrush for a while and was happy to find it for a good price on Amazon.  My first use was at night before bed and it cleaned me teeth amazingly, but the best part was that when I awoke in the morning, my teeth still felt really clean.  My teeth even remain more clean throughout the day between brushing; and even after about 2-3 days of use I noticed that my teeth were whiter and my gums were healthier. Best toothbrush ever!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always used Oral B for my electric toothbrushes.  This one is easy to set up and use.  It&#x27;s an impovement over my last one which was many years old.  Love the new one!!!r</li>
            <li> This is amazing! My teeth feel so fresh and clean. Like getting a professional cleaning everyday. I really love it.</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush! I have not used the timer device that tracks brushing (I am not sure why I need that. ) the toothbrush itself works so well. The different programs will Massage your gums or scrub those pearly whites to a dental hygenist level. My only complaint, very small complaint, is the pause every 30 seconds to indicate time to move to another area. It is a bit long and the toothbrush literally stops for a second and it is weird. Otherwise this is by far the best toothbrush I have owned and I have had several electronic toothbrushes. I highly recommend this one. It is a step above all the rest.</li>
            <li> I switched to this toothbrush after my Rotadent pooped out.  My dentist recommended this brush and I love it, especially the timer that keeps me disciplined about where to brush and for how long.  The smiley face on the read out is a nice coaching tool that gives you a  little bit of immediate gratification.</li>
            <li> Love this toothbrush! I have a small mouth and this brush is comfortable for brushing even the back teeth. I love that I can adjust the speed. I have braces and the lower speed is helpful. I like that water doesn&#x27;t drip inside and get filled with mildew like happened with my old Sonicare. I like seeing the red warning light when I fall back into the bad habit of being a power brusher. I like the timer that shows how long I&#x27;ve been brushing. The carrying case is nice, too.</li>
            <li> I replaced an Oral B I had used for about 25 years. My new brush has great cleaning action.  Love the timer feature and the travel case.</li>
            <li> Wonderful Cleaner for my teeth.  I will do anything to keep my teeth in my head.  So just brush away.  Keep my teeth until I am in the grave.</li>
            <li> Nice product the only problem is a short battery charge , I Almost have to chargre this every day .</li>
            <li> my fiance&#x27; loves this tooth brush. said it&#x27;s the best one he&#x27;s ever had&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s compact, easy to use and does it&#x27;s job.</li>
            <li> The Oral-B Triumph 5000 Electric Tooth brush has been an amazing product. I have seen hundreds of patients who are regularly using this device show unbelievable improvement in their oral health condition.  People of all ages have begun using this rechargeable tooth brush and there is a measurable improvement in the color and texture of the gum, a reduction in bleeding and inflammation, beautiful smile results, and almost universal enjoyment of using the brush.  Many people get these super results in as little as two or three weeks when they start using the brush following a through professional treatment appointment.&lt;br /&gt;The brush comes with a choice of several heads.  All three are designed for different conditions, I suggest visiting your health professional and trying out the choices.  Each one feels and works a bit differently.&lt;br /&gt;The Heads are easy to switch and keeping a &#x27;good&#x27; brush head helps the brush do its job.  It also allows multiple members of the family to share the brush easily by putting a different head in for each family member.  It is also easy to use a different style or model of brush for different areas of the mouth or different conditions, like you have tender areas or sensitive teeth.&lt;br /&gt;The battery is excellent, it will hold a charge for several weeks, so the brush doesn&#x27;t need to be stored on the battery charger.  I have had my current one over a year and a half and it still holds a good charge for several weeks and maintains good stroke power.&lt;br /&gt;The timer that is included is set to monitor the brush time, and the brush itself pauses every 30 seconds so you can move from one corner of your mouth to the next quadrant and complete the entire mouth in two minutes which should provide an excellent cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;The charger takes about 12 hours to fully charge, so every two weeks or whenever the brush indicator shows a battery charge needed, I set the brush on the charger over the day or over night and it is ready to go when needed.&lt;br/&gt;Current research in dental and medical literature shows a correlation to gum disease and overall health.  Controlling gum infection with good home care and regular professional cleaning has been linked to a 50% reduction in strokes and heart attacks.  That is saying people with uncontrolled periodontal disease have a 50% or higher risk of having a stroke or heart attack.&lt;br /&gt;Do yourself a favor, ask your dental professional but get started now.&lt;br /&gt;I believe everyone would benefit from a healthier mouth and this brush will help you achieve that goal.&lt;br /&gt;John W Adams DDS PA, johnwadamsdds.com, jadamsdds@gmail.com</li>
            <li> I got mine through my Dentist and love it. I agree with all the 5 star reviews out here and my only single con I can find with this system, And its a very small one... Is that the little clock / timer doesn&#x27;t have a way for it to stand on its own, they want you to stick it to the wall with double sided tape. Id rather it be able to stand up on its own on the back of my sink , I find that double sided tape comes off after awhile and with all the steam in the bathroom Im afraid it will come loose and then ill have a spot on my wall where it pulled off the paint or something...lol I can make a little stand for it out of Sugru or Polymer clay so, no biggie! If you are looking for an awesome brush, get this one, its pretty awesome if you ask me!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for my first electric toothbrush and I&#x27;m so happy I purchased this one! It is easy to set-up and use and I love the timer that tells you how long to brush in each area!</li>
            <li> Cut my last dental cleaning time in half. Feels like I&#x27;ve left the dental hygienist every time I use it.  Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> This is a fairly pricey toothbrush and I struggled with spending so much money for it. But then I started thinking about how often I paid twenty dollars or more for the cheaper versions at the drug stores and how they were mediocre at best. So I took the plunge and I&#x27;m glad I did. I love this product!</li>
            <li> We used the Oral-B brush for 2 years and like the way it cleans, but have now decided to switch to Philips Sonicare, due to the battery issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After originally buying the brush, I had read about charging issues and thought that it could be overcome with careful charging (i.e. only putting it on the charger when the unit was empty, not after each brushing. But after a year the unit started to lose its charge. So we bought a replacement unit, which, after a year also started to have similar issues. By now, the first unit barely holds the charge for 1 brushing, the second unit for a week, with 1 person using it. Since we are 4 at home, we decided to switch to Sonicare. Philips battery technology seems so far (2 months in) far superior: the unit lasts longer per charge and does not lose any battery life over time. Will update on Philips after longer use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brushing between Philips and Oral-B is different, due to the lower frequency in the Braun, not sure whether one is better than the other, my dentist has no preference, which I assume is due to him not seeing any differences between patients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall: while I liked the cleaning of the Oral-B, like the timer, like the color rings for multiple users, the price/value relationship does not work, due to the poor battery.</li>
            <li> The monitor was scratched, product returned, second time it would not sync properly. I like the overall performance of the product, although it was returned</li>
            <li> Very happy! This was cheaper here than at a local store by 60$ at least. It was recommended by my dentist and  I have not gone back to the dentist yet but I think my check up will go very well.</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush, compatible with a wide series of brush heads, holds a charge well, comes with a good traveling case, easy to operate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It warns you if you brush too hard, and that&#x27;s neat, and it pulses once every 15 or so seconds so you know to move on to another area of your mouth. God rid of my Sonicare for this bad boy and I haven&#x27;t looked back yet.</li>
            <li> I have been a faithful Oral-B electric toothbrush user for as long as I can remember.  They make a HUGE difference in the appearance of your smile and how clean your teeth stay between visits to the Dentist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the last 6 years I have used the very affordable Oral-B Vitality line with good success.  They last for years, do a great job, and can be had for less than $20.  This toothbrush is by far the most expensive model toothbrush I have ever owned.  So what do you get for the extra $$?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More Power.  This toothbrush has much more power than the basic models, and five different settings on how that power is applied to your teeth.  This toothbrush is so powerful that within 2 weeks of starting to use it I lost a 3 surface onlay that had been in my mouth since 1997.  They are only supposed to last for 10 years, and I got 15, so I couldn&#x27;t really complain.  The bottom line is, know your mouth.  If you have a grill full of aged dental work, this toothbrush could wreak havic if you don&#x27;t use one of the settings to tone it down a notch or two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Better feel, better balance.  This toothbrush just feels better in your hand, and has better reach to remote areas of your mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LCD Display.  This is probably the coolest feature about this toothbrush, and it was also my biggest doubt about the toothbrush before ever using it.  By actually monitoring a full two minutes of brushing and having it divide the time up into 4 equal lengths that I can use to give each quadrant of my mouth equal attention, my mouth is much cleaner and healthier than it was with a cheaper Oral-B toothbrush.  I was probably only brushing for 45-60 seconds before, but now I have brushed a full two minutes every time I have used this toothbrush without fail.  I would hate to disappoint the LCD monitor and have it show only 3 out of 4 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In summary, this is a great toothbrush, maybe the best ever.  If you want a cleaner, healthier mouth, this toothbrush will get you there.  Even if you are already using an electric brush.will get you there.  Even if you are already using an electric brush.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this brush for the better part of a month and for the most part, it&#x27;s identical to the [[ASIN:B004O76DEC Oral-B Professional Care SmartSeries 5000]] I purchased just over a year ago.  Overall, it does a great job cleaning your teeth.  For those of you using manual brushes that are considering moving up to electric, there is no contest - GET AN ELECTRIC BRUSH!  This electric brush will clean your teeth in a manner far superior to any manual brush, and for that matter, much better than certain inexpensive electrics such as the [[ASIN:B0014AI4VM Spinbrush Pro]], which I had been using for a few years prior.  Using your favorite toothpaste, The Oral-B will leave your mouth feeling very clean.  As with any toothbrush, manual or electric, it is still very important to floss daily.  When I floss at night, I notice is that there is less crud left between my teeth when using this brush with it&#x27;s Floss Action head..  Less, but not none, so DO continue to floss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I&#x27;m torn about is the \\&quot;nanny\\&quot; aspect of this Oral-B 5000 system and the external display.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a remote external display which stays in radio contact with the brush.  It displays a timer, along with a star and a bar for each of four sections of your mouth.  The four sections represented are the upper left, upper right, lower left and lower right sides of your mouth.  The brush has an internal timer synced with the external display and by default it emits a beep and it pauses every thirty seconds to signal that it&#x27;s time to move on to the next section.  The idea is to spend thirty seconds on each section for a total of two minutes of brushing time.  After two minutes at which time you&#x27;re done with all four sections, the brush beeps, pauses and a smiley face is displayed on the external display.  Oh, happy times!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m torn about this system because I don&#x27;t need the timer and I don&#x27;t like the fact that you cannot turn it off.  I normally brush for over thirty seconds in each section (and I have my own way of brushing) and I don&#x27;t like the way the brush pauses to indicate that its time to move on.  Even though there are five \\&quot;modes of operation\\&quot; and one of them is 45 seconds per section (deep clean), you cannot set that mode as the default.  No, you have to press the mode button five times every time you brush in order to access that mode.  Since they go through all the trouble of the external display, why couldn&#x27;t they make it so you could choose and set your default options?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One useful aspect of the external display is that there is an indicator which lights up red when the brush detects that you are brushing too hard (if you&#x27;re putting too much pressure on the brush).  This is something I do appreciate as brushing too hard can really do a job on your gums (especially with a manual brush).  Its best to allow the brush head to do its job with light pressure.  Having the indicator, which seems fairly accurate, is nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One nitpick is that you pretty much have to keep the brush charging or it will be sluggish after two or three brushings.  The battery indicator is fairly useless as it will still show a full or 2/3 charge when the brush really needs to be charged to avoid it being sluggish.  The brush will still run, but it will be sluggish.  What I mean by sluggish is that the motor noticeably slows down from its peak output, so you&#x27;re not going to get the same clean.  The battery pack seems to be removable, but I cannot find a replacement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Oral-B is one well made brush.  It&#x27;s made in Germany, and it feels solid and well-engineered.  It should last for years.  The Oral-B 5000 system has all the bells and whistles if you desire.  But if you can do without the external display, you could go with the less expensive [[ASIN:B008PEMBNC Oral-B Professional Precision 1000 Rechargeable Toothbrush]], which is basically the same brush, but without the external display.  It still has the internal 30 second timer which pauses after each section and five modes of operation.  It just does with out the external display and the indicator that lights up when you brush too hard.  If you can do without that, the 1000 is less than half the price for what is basically the same brush.nd timer which pauses after each section and five modes of operation.  It just does with out the external display and the indicator that lights up when you brush too hard.  If you can do without that, the 1000 is less than half the price for what is basically the same brush.</li>
            <li> Here are the reasons why I like it. I honestly can&#x27;t think of any cons...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*The travel case is handy. Just take the toothbrush and your toothpaste and you&#x27;re all set. You don&#x27;t need to lug the stand since the toothbrush remains charged for several days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I like the red light that comes on when you&#x27;re brushing too hard. I had no idea that I was brushing too hard, so the warning light is great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*The brush heads are interchangeable with other Oral-B toothbrushes, which is awesome! Since we now have 2 Oral-B toothbrushes it&#x27;s much easier to buy a set of replacement brush heads for BOTH, than it would be to have a different type for each toothbrush. I love this features since it saves both money and headaches (having a replacement head for 1 toothbrush when you really need a replacement head for the other toothbrush).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*The brush heads are changeable, meaning people who share the same bathroom can use the same toothbrush \\&quot;base\\&quot;, but change out the heads. This is a little skeevy for me, because I&#x27;d think there&#x27;s a bit of the other user&#x27;s toothpaste/saliva residue, but give it a good cleaning after each use, and you&#x27;re good. I&#x27;m not sure that I&#x27;ll use this feature, but it&#x27;s great to have instead of requiring people to buy multiple toothbrushes (which can get pricey quickly).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*The little wireless monitor screen. I like it. Didn&#x27;t quite get it at first, but it also helps you to know when you&#x27;re brushing too hard and it helps you \\&quot;see\\&quot; the 30-second quadrants for the 4 areas of your mouth that make up the 2 minute drill. I think it&#x27;s a clock when not in use, but I haven&#x27;t been able to set the clock so far (and I stopped trying). You also don&#x27;t need it in order to travel with your toothbrush, which is nice. (You actually don&#x27;t need it at all, but I like it.)</li>
            <li> My husband and I bought this set from our dentist and we love it. It has space to store four different heads and has options for the type of cleaning you want. We bought an extra head for me. My husband normally hates power toothbrushes but he loves this one. And it helps make sure he brushes the right way. And the dentist is happy with both of us.</li>
            <li> Call me simple, but I love having the 30-second reminders to switch zones when I am brushing and the smiley face when you hit two minutes is a nice way to start the day. Like any electric toothbrush, the heads do wear a little quickly, but Amazon has pretty good deals on replacements.</li>
            <li> I received this toothbrush thru the Amazon Vine program, and reviewed it on the original product page. That page indicates it has been superseded (and therefore won&#x27;t link) by the one on this page, though they appear to be identical.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started using a [[ASIN:B00240XRUY Oral-B Cross Action Power Toothbrush]] with the AAA battery about five years ago and the hygienist in my dentist&#x27;s office said there was a noticeable difference in the condition of my teeth and gums. When this one came along on Vine I thought, \\&quot;What a great way to upgrade.\\&quot; After using it a while I can say it was a worthwhile move.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I take it out of the box, I notice it has a quality feel to it. I note it is made in Germany. It came with one \\&quot;Floss Action\\&quot; brush head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So What&#x27;s to Like?&lt;br /&gt;The charging base can be kept separate from the brush head holder. If you are short on counter space, as I am, this is a handy feature. Mrs. Boilermate doesn&#x27;t care for any power brush, so the extra head holder is extraneous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy to use. I think it is well balanced, and it fits my ham hand quite well. Use too much pressure, and the handle and monitor light up red. It easily rinses clean when I am done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course it is louder than a manual brush, but it is quieter than the Cross Action. It has a smoother and more pleasant sound as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Cross Action buzzes your teeth as it cleans. This one cleans without feeling like it&#x27;s going to vibrate your fillings out. The brush head feels softer but it feels like it is cleaning better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like that the brush beeps and pauses briefly every 30 seconds as a reminder to move on to the next quadrant. It is designed so that you get used to brushing for the dentist recommended two minutes, but after the fourth quadrant it merely pauses and then continues running. It doesn&#x27;t shut off when you two minutes are up, a plus IMO.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The included monitor counts up the time while you brush and shows you which quadrant you have completed. It also shows which program you selected, and shows the time when you&#x27;re not using the toothbrush. The monitor may be useful if you have children and you&#x27;re trying to teach the proper way to brush the teeth. They may like the smiley face and the stars that light up as they complete each quadrant. The monitor can be stored on the shelf or mounted on the wall using a holder that supplied with the kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The travel case makes it easy to take this when I travel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What&#x27;s Not to Like?&lt;br /&gt;If you do need the extra heads, the holder takes up valuable counter space. It cannot be wall-mounted. Stored flat, the heads cannot drip dry as well, especially with the cover over them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The replacement head cost. At over six bucks apiece, you could buy a whole new Cross Action brush for the cost of one refill head for this. And this kit only comes with one. If you have a family that uses this, the costs can add up very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Next to Bottom Line&lt;br /&gt;Do we need this appliance? No. In the same sense we don&#x27;t need a power mower to mow the lawn. A push type reel mower will cut the grass but it really doesn&#x27;t do as good a job as a power mower. My dentist has told me for years that a power brush does a better job cleaning your teeth than a manual one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Bottom Line&lt;br /&gt;If it were my own money, would I buy the Oral B Professional 5000, or consider the [[ASIN:B003UKKHB4 Oral-B Professional 3000]] which has the same basic features but with fewer bells and whistles? If I had children I would probably consider this model. The visual guides on the monitor are good teaching aids. Since I don&#x27;t, and considering I would be the only one using it, I would probably save about 30 bucks and opt for the 3000.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 1/17/13&lt;br /&gt;I still really like this toothbrush, but...It turns out the monitor is a battery hog. I put two fresh alkaline batteries in the monitor when I received it in June of lastyear, and this week they are dead. Since the brush unit still works as before I don&#x27;t think I will bother to replace them. This only confirms my comments above...I don&#x27;t feel there is sufficient added value to justify the higher price this model commands over the Professional 3000.</li>
            <li> So far I really like this thing and the default floss action head. I do feel my gums are a bit cleaner, though I did a pretty good job brushing prior with my regular toothbrush. The timer is nice. I wish the timer weren&#x27;t shaped so awkwardly...it&#x27;s basically designed so that you can&#x27;t put it down on a flat surface and read it easily because it slopes backwards awkwardly, and you can&#x27;t mount it on the left side of a mirror if there is something just to the left of it, because of the weird way the thing slides. Just a bad design in general for the timer...so I&#x27;m knocking a star off for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the head doesn&#x27;t spin in circles like a dentists tools, but rather makes little wiggles side to side, making it look like it&#x27;s circling in a way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Close enough.</li>
            <li> Does anyone need a $100 toothbrush?  Probably not but it does keep you honest if you try to brush for two minutes.  The gimmick is the little clock that times the four quadrants of your mouth.  If you do it for two minutes you will see a little happy face! I bought it because my dental hygienist raved about it. I bought it mostly because it lights up in red if you apply to much pressure. I have had the Oral B electric toothbrush for years and wouldn&#x27;t use anything else. Why not spend a little extra on your teeth. You are worth it!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this toothbrush! it&#x27;s even fun to use and makes my teeth and gums feel great. I bought the Oral_B Professional Health Clean at the recommendation of my dentist. I had gingivitis and it has reversed it quickly after just a few weeks of using this toothbrush. I received this toothbrush promptly and in excellent condition from the seller.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this Oral B.  This units was recommended to me by my Dentist over three years ago and he still has this as his preferred unit he recommends his patients use for optimal oral hygiene health. Great find on Amazon as far as the pricing as I saved over $45 on this unit from the price my dentist was quoting from his office.</li>
            <li> Excellent toothbrush. This is the second Oral-B toothbrush we have bought and love them. Keep teeth in excellent health.Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have gum disease, and can&#x27;t seem to floss enough, or good enough. I was using the usual Oral-B, with the small heads, sold everywhere. I came across this one on Amazon, accidentally, and it sounded interesting. It works! It cleans much better than the usual Oral-B, and the timer is nice, serves as a clock, too. I hope they will always have the replacement brush heads!</li>
            <li> Dentist told me that I didnt need a cleaning. First time that&#x27;s ever happened</li>
            <li> Have had an Oral B before and liked it a lot. This new one is even better than the first one does a great job. The Floss action brush is awesome.&lt;br /&gt;Don P</li>
            <li> I use this product every day&lt;br /&gt;So far this is the best I ever have, the most expensive those&lt;br /&gt;All the functions work well&lt;br /&gt;The only thing different from the product description is the battery charging time.&lt;br /&gt;It takes me 20 hours to fully charge the product ( the indicator light gone off) After that it will last for 4 days with 8 mins using each day.&lt;br /&gt;To me. that is so bad, my Philips shaver last for weeks after 4 hours charging</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to get excited about a toothbrush, this is hands-down the best toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever used.  It just arrived a few days ago, but I can already tell a difference after using an older electric Oral B for years.  Teeth feel smooth as glass after the first use.</li>
            <li> It feels like you just had your teeth professionally cleaned each time you use it. We&#x27;ll worth the investment for your family.</li>
            <li> As far as cleaning, I rate it 5 *&#x27;s.  It does a wonderful job &amp; it feels like I&#x27;ve just been to the hygienist for my 6 month cleaning.  I rate it lower because of the battery life. Two of us use it twice a day. After 3 days we need to recharge it, and the charge cycle is 24 hours.  We expected a 5 day life out of a full charge.</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush.  I&#x27;ve always had a problem with brushing too hard an this prevents that and gets my teeth totally clean.  Recommend highly.</li>
            <li> Gave to my son for Christmas. After he got home and used for first time, he called me to grill just how much I spent as I am on a strict budget. He loved it so much he thought I paid much more for it!</li>
            <li> UPDATE: 4 years later and I&#x27;m still using this toothbrush, except that the battery BARELY lasts a full 2-minute brush (on normal mode). It&#x27;s really frustrating. Literally a couple nights ago (after the brush has been on the charging stand all day), I brushed my teeth and it died before 2 minutes. It&#x27;s probably been this way for 1 - 1.5 years but I&#x27;ve been too cheap and lazy to buy a new one. However, it is frustrating cause every time I travel, I have to bring the charger with (kinda defeats the purpose of a mobile toothbrush), and honestly, if it sits off the charger for more than an hour, then it&#x27;s just dead. So even if it&#x27;s been charging overnight, and I take it off the charger, put it in its travel case, get to my location 2 hours later, and try to brush my teeth there, it would be dead. I have to let it charge for a bit before trying to use it. It&#x27;s pretty dumb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m shopping for a new one now. My spouse has a Philips Sonicare, and had one for 7+ years, and has never had such bad battery power. I&#x27;m going to give Oral-B one last try, but if the battery can&#x27;t last after a couple years use, I&#x27;m definitely switching my loyalty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*******************&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE this toothbrush. It&#x27;s so much more efficient than brushing your teeth manually. The travel case it comes with is awesome, as well as the stand for the tooth brush and compartment that can hold up to 4 brushes. I love that this toothbrush comes with the independent clock, which is useful even when not using the toothbrush. It&#x27;s also engaging. The toothbrush itself comes with 5 brush options and the light will turn red if you&#x27;re brushing too hard! Very comfortable to hold in the hand. I&#x27;m really happy with this purchase!</li>
            <li> After reading other reviews I decided to go with this. I drink coffee and tea and wanted a better way to keep my teeth from staining. I had been to the dentist for a cleaning and thought is was a perfect time to switch to this cordless tooth brush. My teeth feel really clean and my teeth are staying white. I feel this was worth the investment. I can&#x27;t wait for my next dental check up to see if the hygienist notices.</li>
            <li> This is a pretty good electric toothbrush, bought it due to other reviews by I wasn&#x27;t that impressed. I just use the brush. The little timer gadget was impossible to even open to use so it never made it out of the box. Decent toothbrush.</li>
            <li> The first few times I used this Oral B, I felt like I had been to the dentist. It is simple to use, and the smiley face on the viewing panel provides ample motivation for me to brush my teeth for a full 2 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It could do with improved battery life, and fuller information in the instructions. Otherwise, great product.</li>
            <li> I bought the 5000 series expecting some fancy technology, what with the &#x27;smartguide&#x27; and all the advertised fancy features.  I was disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would say that unless you are very bad at brushing your teeth and need a &#x27;nanny&#x27; to tell you what to do every step of the way, then buy a cheaper model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought the smartguide was really quite dumb. As one person said, it does make a nice bathroom clock. But unless mine is faulty it doesn&#x27;t seem that smart. I would expect the smartguide to want you to brush your teeth (at least) twice a day, but if I miss a morning, by the evening I brush my teeth and it&#x27;s all smiles again. I find the professional mode annoying too. I wouldn&#x27;t mind the toothbrush beeping every 30 seconds to advise you to switch brushing areas, but I dislike the brush pausing at each 30 second mark, so I have decided to switch the guide to the simpler 2 minute timer.  That the deep clean mode is &#x27;only&#x27; brushing for extra time seems a cheat too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did find the pressure warning useful to start, as I was brushing my teeth harder than the toothbrush wanted. I have cured myself of that habit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The carry case is nice, but I don&#x27;t find the brush holder useful. Perhaps families that share the same base unit will.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To sum up, most of the fancy features of this toothbrush weren&#x27;t as sophisticated as I&#x27;d expected and I was left underwhelmed.  My next electric toothbrush will be a cheaper and simpler design.</li>
            <li> This little toothbrush is worth its price.  Talk about squeaky clean teeth!  Guess whose dentist was pleased with the upkeep between cleanings?  It packs well, lasts a few days without a charge and the little smiley face clock is fun to us to keep track on how much longer on this quadrant one needs to brush.  When I travel however, I dont bring the smiley clock as the brush has a been system to let you know when to move to a different area to brush and when the cycle of cleaning is over.  It comes with colored rings and a case for up to 4 brushes for the family to use.  It does vibrate the hand and the jaw/head, and if you&#x27;re prone to migraines this wouldnt be the toothbrush for you.</li>
            <li> Everybody should have confidence on the product of Germany, it make my teeth healthier and it acts like a babysitter caring my teeth gently and warm-hearted.</li>
            <li> I bought this brush because of my past history with oral-B.  My dentist recommended it to me.  That was 12 years ago and now after two oral-B brushes this is my third one.  Dentist knows best no cavities in 12 years!  Great company good product.</li>
            <li> I love that the timer is connected to the toothbrush and that it comes with a travel case.  After using the toothbrush I can defiantly feel a difference on how much cleaner my teeth feel.</li>
            <li> This is my second Oral-B with the other one being about 15 years old.  It was so worn that the brushes would not stay on the tip.  This one is almost too aggressive.  Even on the &amp;#34;feather touch&amp;#34; setting, the floss action head made my gums sore.  (I brush and floss so I&#x27;m not a softie.)  I purchased a soft brush head and use it on regular speed with no ill effects.  I now use the floss head about 25% of the time with no problems.  It could have been simply a matter of getting accustomed to &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; brushing.&lt;br /&gt;I also found the handle a bit &amp;#34;awkard&amp;#34;.  It is thick, the sides are smooth, and it tapers toward the top.  I sometimes have trouble gripping it.  These items aside, it does a wonderful job of cleaning my teeth and they are much cleaner than they ever were with my old unit.  My dentist says my mouth is in the top 5 he looks into and was #2 until a few years ago when I reached my 60&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would I buy another one like this one?  In a heartbeat!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS The timer/clock is a nice feature because not only do appreciate the brushing timer but it&#x27;s nice to have a clock in the bathroom.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the toothbrush for a while now and it seems to do a great job.  I haven&#x27;t had my next dentist check-up yet, so that will be the real test.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Travel case is great, I use it often.  And the charging stand is very convenient for storage and charging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-1 star for the Wireless SmartGuide.  Save yourself a few bucks and get the version that doesn&#x27;t include it.  In my opinion its completely unnecessary.</li>
            <li> I never knew my teeth could be this clean!!! I love this and am very happy with everything about it! I like the timer and I didn&#x27;t think that was something I would care about, but it is quite convenient! Have only had it for 2 recharges but have been very happy with it.</li>
            <li> i just don&#x27;t feel like my teeth are clean unless i have an electric toothbrush. i like that the small head is able to get behind my back molars easily. i love that there is a time too.  my dentist said my teeth are looking really good and there was hardly any scraping done at this last cleaning!</li>
            <li> I used the Phillips electric toothbrush for years.  After replacing it 3 different times over the years because it wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge, I decided I would try a new product and purchased the Oral-B.  The Oral-B makes you feel like you just had your teeth cleaned and polished.  Way better than the Phillips.  The only downside to it is it tends to make more of a mess (more splatter).</li>
            <li> It really makes your teeth feel cleaner!!  One of the best decisions we made!!  We would highly recommend this product!!!</li>
            <li> My dentist uses this same toothbrush. After I researched electric and sonic toothbrushes, I choose this one. I went to my dentist and told him. To my pleasant surprise, he uses this same one based on his research.</li>
            <li> Love the circular rotation, it does make you feel like you have just come from dentist. All the ancillary timers are a waste but still five stars.</li>
            <li> great upgrade from our old one.  have to learn how to program the various settings.  my dentist loves my good checkups from using a power brush</li>
            <li> I have had this model toothbrush for quite sometime.  I purchased this one for my daughter.  She loves it.  In just a short time, you will notice a difference in not only how your teeth look and feel, but in your brushing habits.</li>
            <li> My husband had already used this [gift], so I didn&#x27;t return it (also didn&#x27;t want to deal with the hassle), but since he used it the first time, it turn red and vibrates to tell him he is brushing too hard (even if it isn&#x27;t in his mouth).  SO annoying.  I have the old low-tech version and I love it... the external component and lights and crap on this one are too much.  It&#x27;s just a toothbrush- I&#x27;ll go simple next time... less stuff to break on it.</li>
            <li> I just love my electric toothbrush.  Lots of power and leaves you with the feeling like you just came back from the dentist.  What a great clean feeling!</li>
            <li> my teeth feel clean. love the smart guide. wished it came with 2 brushes to give one to my husband or I could order a replacement to use same charger and smart guide but this does not affect the awesome toothbrush at all</li>
            <li> Love this toothbrush! Did a lot of researching and chose this over the Sonicare for -1. Price 2. Other reviews &amp; 3. My own past experiences with both brands. I personally find Oral B just cleans better, has more brush head options &amp; the rechargeable battery life seems longer. Gives an absolute deep clean without being too aggressive. I love it!</li>
            <li> Could like a product much more than this toothbrush! Used it almost 6 months. No issues what so ever. Even told my dentist to recommend it to his patients!</li>
            <li> This is a very effective way to maintain dental health. It has a timer to make sure that each quadrant of the mouth is given proper attention. The unit gives good performance and Amazon gave us the chance to purchase at a very economical price.</li>
            <li> I bought this product as my earlier Oral-B brush was approaching end of life. It does a good job of brushing along with floss action. One of the nice things about this unit is that it comes with a rechargeable battery. The display that comes with it is unnecessarily large though in my opinion. It does not show a whole a lot information, and could be shrunk into a smaller form factor. Overall, a very good buy.</li>
            <li> We have used Oral-B electric toothbrushes for many years. It was time for a new one, so we got this - and we love it! I highly recommend this toothbrush!</li>
            <li> I have a problem with building up plaque on my teeth. The brush head makes my teeth feel very clean. I will know more when I get my teeth cleaned at the dentist.</li>
            <li> It seems to me that there are a lot of electric toothbrushes out there and while the Oral-B Professional Healthy Clean + Floss Action Precision 5000 does the job, if I could go back in time, I&#x27;d probably try another brand.  The battery life just isn&#x27;t lasting and I hate to have extra \\&quot;stuff\\&quot; (the charger) on my bathroom counter all the time.  BUT, this toothbrush isn&#x27;t all bad...I really like that it times how long you brush and that it vibrates to let you know when it&#x27;s time to move on to another section of your mouth.  The battery powered display is also a nice addition and I appreciate being notified if I&#x27;m brushing too hard.  Lastly, the travel case makes bringing this toothbrush on vacation a breeze for two (the travel case holds the toothbrush and two replacement brushes.)</li>
            <li> we have been having a lot of dental work. this brush is so versatile with a long life battery and we love it!</li>
            <li> I purchased two Oral B 5000 at the same time.  One for my wife &amp; one for me.  Well, after one day of working, all of a sudden, my toothbrush had issues when the red led light will not go off.  It says I&#x27;m pressing too hard on my teeth, even when I pull the entire brush away from my teeth.  I&#x27;ve tried everything with no success after two days and then called customer service.  Unlike other products, the nearest service center is more than a 10-drive and they advised I needed to ship my entire brush with accessories to Massachusetts (I live in VA).  Also, they stated they will replace or repair but it would take at least 15 days.  So not only do I have to pay the shipping costs, I have to go buy another toothbrush (unfortunately threw my old one out).  At least Oral B could send a box (like many other companies) and pay the shipping costs.  When spending $90+ for a toothbrush, I think there should be better customer service.</li>
            <li> Its the best rated unit out there. First time electric toothbrush user. Recommended by my dental hygienist. Going from manual toothbrush to this unit is like night and day. This electric unit cleans each tooth individually on all 4 sides. Its fun to brush now and let the electric motor do all the hard work. Go with the top of the line 5000, its $50 more than the starter model but that is inexpensive vs the yearly +$100 for dental cleaning.</li>
            <li> REVIEW UPDATE AFTER 3 WEEKS OF DAILY USE:&lt;br /&gt;This is an awesome product.  The \\&quot;timer\\&quot; function makes the time fly by.  I often want to continue after 2 minutes have passed.  My mouth feels cleaner than with any other toothbrush, and my teeth are noticeably whiter.&lt;br /&gt;The reasons why this product got 4 and not 5 stars are listed below in my original review.&lt;br /&gt;------------------------------------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;ORIGINAL REVIEW (after several days of use)&lt;br /&gt;------------------------------------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;I enjoy using this product, and it appears to be extremely well made.  I have two problems with this purchase right off the bat:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.This is a \\&quot;Braun\\&quot; electric toothbrush.  I don&#x27;t know if Oral-b had it made special or if it is a off-the-shelf product for Braun.  I  bought this toothbrush because I trust the Oral-b brand.  All the parts (toothbrush, wireless guide, recharge base, etc.) are branded \\&quot;Braun\\&quot;.  Some also say \\&quot;Oral-b\\&quot; in smaller letters.  The only thing that is made by \\&quot;Oral-b\\&quot; is the single brush head that came in the package.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. It is not a \\&quot;retail\\&quot; package.  If you buy this toothbrush in a store, it comes in a box with a lot of info on it.  What I received was a small brown cardboard carton with the toothbrush and accessories packed inside.  I now see that Amazon lists the packaging as \\&quot;Amazon Frustration Free\\&quot;.  It turns out \\&quot;Amazon Frustration Free\\&quot; means a much less fancy package.  Kudos to Amazon for reducing packaging waste (and shipping costs), but I would have been happier if I had known to expect this.</li>
            <li> This is a fabulous product!  My teeth feel like I just left the dentist office when I&#x27;m done.  The charger stand makes it simple to keep charged and stores your additional brush heads.  I won&#x27;t go back to a manual brush again!</li>
            <li> I purchased this item as a gift so there for I can not really rate it myself.  The receive of the gift really likes it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t a toothbrush shutting itself off if I apply too much pressure. This is infuriating. I wonder what designer thought thisi was a good idea. Wrong, just wrong...</li>
            <li> This one is a step from the simple one I previously had,  It has a good power motor and cleans your teeth well enough.</li>
            <li> Works wonderful, leaving teeth squeeky clean. Device comes with timer and a great travel case for when you are on the road. Loving it!</li>
            <li> I had been contemplating a power toothbrush for a couple of years. When I saw this product reviewed on Dr. Oz&#x27;s show and found it for a decent price on Amazon (and I had a $15 rebate), I decided to go for it. This model has more bells and whistles than I need, but it makes my mouth feel cleaner than brushing with a regular toothbrush.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush works really well. . love it!  I really like the timer.  It really does keep me in track.</li>
            <li> Great Product and make my teeth feel so clean. It holds it&#x27;s charge very well and lasts for approximately two weeks +/-.</li>
            <li> I have handicapped hands love this.. cleans well fast shipping</li>
            <li> I have used this product for several months now.  It replaced a previous Oral-B electric Brush which was decades old.  It came with a deep cleaning brush hear which is a little larger than the brush head I am use to using.  I hav ego say that wince you get use to the larger brush head, it does a noticeable better job deep cleaning your gums and all.  I will switch to the larger brush head now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does have a wireless attachments which follows your progress in brushing your teeth and gives you some attaboys (stars), as your progress through brushing your mouth.  The real value of this remote device is if you have children, or  just like some thing cute in the bathroom.  My only comments for improving the wireless device is to make it easier to read.  It is a dim grey LED display on a gray background.  I am sure if you are 10 years old you will be able to see it clearly, but your grandparents might not find it easy to read if you give it as a gift to older people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Defineatly a worthwhile investment and a strong recommendation to buy.  I really like hold the charger pops out of the base for travel and it ha a very useful traveler case which is included.</li>
            <li> The only think that it seems a bit strong for my gums. It would be perfect with a softer brush.</li>
            <li> Lives up to it&#x27;s reputation.  Dentist always comments on how great a job we do on our oral hygiene.  Purchased as a replacement for an old Sonicare.  While the Oral-B heads are a bit bigger than the Sonicare, it didn&#x27;t take long to get used to it.  I like the fact that the Oral-B handle is better sealed than the Sonicare, so it&#x27;s very easy to clean.</li>
            <li> love the multiple settings.</li>
            <li> This is a fabulous toothbrushing system.  I have had 3 Oral B&#x27;s and this one tops them all.  Wish it came with more toothbrushes as it only came with one flossing brush.  This brush is amazing!  It removes plaque like no other.  If you are on the fence about which model to choose, choose this one.  It&#x27;s worth the extra $$$!</li>
            <li> My son&#x27;s dentist recommended this and he loves it!  Made a great Christmas present. Highly recommend this product!  Will probably get one for myself.</li>
            <li> We got our daughter one of these last Christmas and she forgot to bring it on a trip so we got her a battery operated toothbrush like the rest of us use at home. She was very disappointed and after receiving one of these for Christmas this year myself, I can see why! It feels like I&#x27;ve been to the dentist and had a cleaning EVERY time I use it! Highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> Awesome toothbrush, love that they sell extra soft bristles for those of us with sensitive gums :)</li>
            <li> When I recently purchased this Oral-B Professional toothbrush, I had no idea it would be that good! It has been much more than great, it has been fantastic!  To tell you the truth, it has surpass all my expectations, and I&#x27;m not easy to please, especially with high-end acquisitions.  It&#x27;s almost like a robot, leaving one with not much else to do but put it in your mouth and hold.  It&#x27;s really that good.  You save in the cost of Dental visits, although I still go as scheduled, by buying one.  Pricy ...yes, but worth every penny and more.  No, I&#x27;m not being paid to tell you this.  LOL.</li>
            <li> I have purchased three of these, one for me and two others as gifts, and as far as I know, the recipients have been very satisfied with the gifts.</li>
            <li> The product is great. I hate how Amazon repackaged the product, Several months ago I bought this item from amazon and it was not repackaged, I guess it just feels like a grade A replacement when does not come in the original box.&lt;br /&gt;Also there where no instructions in the new packaging or helpful hints like the original box might of had.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is all it is cracked up to be. Wish I had purchased one a long time ago. Well worth it, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I had a Braun electric toothbrush for a long time and needed a change.  The main problem with the old one was the battery was junk, so I couldn&#x27;t use it more than a couple days without it running out.  But enough about that product....  I&#x27;ve been using the Oral-B now for several weeks and glad I went with this.  I feel it does a great job cleaning and always leaves my mouth feeling fresh afterwards.  The extra features are great as well.  The quadrant notification is definitely helpful in making sure you are hitting each part of the mouth equally.  The included display also provides a way of knowing your progress and includes a clock which is definitely helpful when getting ready in the morning.  I also like the included travel case and container to keep the brush heads in as it keeps them clean throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all I would definitely recommend this for someone looking for a new toothbrush as I feel it does a great job and includes plenty of extras for a decent price.</li>
            <li> My son had a battery toothbrush prior to this one and he says this is by far the better of the two.  His teeth are looking much whiter. Thsnkd.</li>
            <li> Love this brush! The time is cool and its easy to find the attachment/brush heads and it works great!! It helps to ensure I&#x27;m not brushing too hard too!</li>
            <li> Love the timer lets you know if you are applying to much pressure.  Ability to change the speed of the brush is nice.  Many brush choices available for what ever your personal want is.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I feel like I am out of the dentist&#x27;s chair every morning after brushing my teeth with the Oral-B Professional Healthy Clean (precision clean head)! I am totally loving it and have recommended it to all my friends.</li>
            <li> I like this very much.  It cleans my teeth and gums very well.  I really recommend it.  The different color floss heads are detachable which means you can share this with your spouse.</li>
            <li> My mouth and teeth really feel clean when I finish brushing with this toothbrush and I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to recommend it to my friends.</li>
            <li> All in all it is high quality and reliable product. However, allthough I live in Singapore the propduct did not include Singaporean charger. Because of this, I was not able to use it since the VOLTAGE is totaly different in Singapore and US. Will ask for replacement and hope it will not take long to get it (without additional costs)...&lt;br /&gt;If the charger was ok all would have been PERFECT!&lt;br /&gt;Recommend to buy it.</li>
            <li> It is an excellent product which keeps on improving with each new model. Will buy the same product again if needed.</li>
            <li> I bought this toothbrush because my dentist said I needed to get a &amp;#34;deeper&amp;#34; clean on my teeth and gums.  They recommended this tooth brush at my dentist office but I wanted to do my own research.  After I compared it to other leading brands I found this one to be the best for what my dentist wanted and the price and value.  I bought it from Amazon because the price was the best and when I bought mine they offered me coupons.</li>
            <li> The product is good. The only regret is that it looked exactly the same other model I have bought last year which did not need a voltage conversor, it worked perfectly for 110 or 120&amp;#62; I thought I was choosing the same exactly model but apparently I made a mistake. This brush only works with 110 v. (Ok for the US, not for Europe or South America)&amp;#62; Probably my fault, I am just hightlighting this in case this is important for other customer as well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great thing. I can&#x27;t find any cons from using it.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s waterproof. It has that little screen, that improves your cleaning experience. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it for seven month and i had only one serious problem.&lt;br /&gt;The charging dock can be used only with american voltage. So if you&#x27;re a traveller and going to Europe, it can be a bit problematic to charge it. I&#x27;ve bought a commutator, that converts european voltage on american.</li>
            <li> I hope the brush heads are not too expensive, but this toothbrush for under $140 was cheaper than anyone I found on Walmart.com. Also, it vibrated the most per second, not sure how much this matters, but I felt like I got the right one.</li>
            <li> Awesome,,after only a few used my teeth and mouth felt much clearer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A good price for  four differant settings enjoy</li>
            <li> The best brush I have ever used, it has a timer and it make you aware of how long you are spending on cleaning your teeth correctly, If you do it right your teeth feel amazingly clean. My dentist told me my plack build up was less than the month before that was good enough for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ed Brown</li>
            <li> My biggest regret concerning this product is not buying it sooner. I have used those cheap 10 dollar electric toothbrushes for many years. I figured even those were miles ahead of any manual. I did not see the point in dropping so much money for a higher end model. I flossed, brushed, and used mouthwash. I was golden. Except I wasn&#x27;t. A few months ago I got some bad news from my dentist. I had 4 cavities and mild gingivitis. I was confused and angry. So, I stepped up my game!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let&#x27;s talk about the head shape firstly. I was iffy on this particular design because the head is so much smaller. Now I realize that it cups each tooth to clean better. With the impressive movements of it, it does not take any longer to brush your teeth. You only need to spend a few seconds on each tooth to get them perfectly slick. I literally feel like I just came from the dentist every time I brush. I used to roll my eyes when they said that in commercials, but now I see it&#x27;s true! Well, with this product at least.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like the features that help you brush more effectively. The external guide isn&#x27;t super useful, but does keep you on track to ensure you&#x27;re brushing for two minutes. It also makes for a nice bathroom clock. My favorite features are when it lights up when you brush too hard, and the *very brief* pause when going to a new mouth quadrant. I now know just how firmly I can press down before it&#x27;s too much for my enamel. That gives me so much peace of mind. The pausing makes it so that my eyes are not constantly on the external timer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My gums are looking so good now. I can&#x27;t wait to get more favorable feedback from my dentist! Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> This is my second Oral-B product.  Didn&#x27;t think I would ever wear out my first toothbrush but the battery finally died. These products are well made and built to last. Charging stand was cheapen somewhat since my first Oral-B but it didn&#x27;t include the display and clock. I&#x27;m very happy with this product and will continue to purchase Oral-B products.</li>
            <li> This is an awesome toothbrush.  Works great - no negatives.  Really eliminates plaque.  Very simply to use, controls an indicators are clear.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my son and he loves it!  The product was shipped fast!</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush, took me a while to get used to the timer system but now I know I always brush long enough.  Before this I always overestimated the time and stopped brushing too early</li>
            <li> This Oral-B product is superbly designed and is appropriate for a maximum of four users (if each uses only one toothbrush).  My wife and I use this product.  I like the separate holding areas for the brushes and the ability to put the cover down.  The product has plenty of power, enough so that each of use can brush our teeth on the charge without the unit running out of steam.  I also like the two-minute timer that alerts you when an acceptable time of brushing has occurred.  I always go beyond the two minute mark, but I am confident that I haven&#x27;t undercleaned.  The unit fits nicely on a fairly small surface.  VERY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!</li>
            <li> This wass ordered for my daughter.  She relly like it.  Is there any way I can purchase a waranty for it.  I did not buy it originally because I was not sure it was the right tooth brush.</li>
            <li> I needed to replace my old oral-B 1000 toothbrush since it slowed down after nine years.  I didn&#x27;t really see much difference between this one and the more expensive one so for $20 less it was a good buy. I highly reccomend it.</li>
            <li> This brush has a lot of power. A little rough on the teeth but cleans extremely well. I love the timer that came with it and the multiple brush holder.</li>
            <li> I love this unit.  The timing ability is just perfect for me.  I use the nornal 30 second time for both lower quadrants and then change to the 45 second timer for the two upper quadrants.  Although the unit comes with a free&#x3D;standing unit that shows the passage of the brushing time, I think that particular unit is rather useless.  The time is very clearliy heard from the &amp;#34;beep&amp;#34; of the brush.</li>
            <li> This is the best tooth brush I have ever used.  It cleans my teeth better than my old electric tooth brush.</li>
            <li> Works like a typical Braun. Love the seperate display and different cleaning levels. Just wish the charge lasted longer as both my wife and I use it twice a day and we get about 3-4 days before it needs a charge. You definetly feel the difference with a fresh charge.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this toothbrush!  It feels like you just visited the dentist for a professional cleaning.  I will never go back to using a regular toothbrush.  Never!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried a Sonicare electric toothbrush for a couple of months, but I wasn&#x27;t completely impressed with it.  It seemed to irritate and inflame my gums.  I returned it to the store and then ordered this Oral-B from Amazon.  I was amazed at how much better it cleaned my teeth than the Sonicare did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the &amp;#34;gentle&amp;#34; setting on the Oral-B, with a sensitive brush head, and my gums, along with my teeth, feel incredible.  I really like the timer that beeps every 30 seconds signaling it&#x27;s time to move to another quadrant of your mouth.  It guides you through the dentist-recommended 2 minutes brushing time.  I&#x27;d venture to say that I seldom (if ever) used to brush my teeth for a full 2 minutes before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only regret is that I didn&#x27;t find this sooner!  I&#x27;m so impressed that I plan to order one as a Christmas gift for my son and daughter-in-law.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t hesitate.  Do yourself a favor and just buy it!</li>
            <li> I love all the features of this brush. It is a very well thought product. The travel case also comes in very handy. Fits the brush, 2 heads AND my tongue cleaner! Another plus of this product is it&#x27;s battery life. Lasts over a week for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m extremely happy with this device. It&#x27;s the 3rd or 4th Oral-B electric toothbrush I&#x27;ve bought and they keep getting better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Works great, lots of power, but doesn&#x27;t hurt when you use it.&lt;br /&gt;-Feels really solid.&lt;br /&gt;-Great battery life, uses about 1/4 of a charge for about 15+ brushing session (kinda guesstimating).&lt;br /&gt;-The remote display works really well, shows how long you&#x27;ve brushing and has 4 quadrants that fill up after 30 seconds of brushing. Also shows the regular clock time in between brushing, which is nice to keep track of when you&#x27;re getting ready for work or whatever.&lt;br /&gt;-The included stand works well to keep the base unit upright and charging. Also the brush compartment protects the brushes from whatever splashes out of your sink, but leaves room for air to circulate to dry the brushes.&lt;br /&gt;-Uses the same brush heads as the previous 2-3 generations so I could just keep using them. Not sure if they will continue the form factor for the next few generations, but a positive sign.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-Charging takes forever, I&#x27;m guessing since they expect you to leave it plugged in all the time. Not a fan of trickle charging myself. It seems to take over 8 hours to do a 1/4 charge.&lt;br /&gt;-Doesn&#x27;t have a polarized or grounded plug, strange to see nowadays. Maybe that&#x27;s not really a con.&lt;br /&gt;-Very cheap looking travel case. It seems pretty strong and decent coverage, but not as nice as the cordura semi-rigid cases they used to give you.</li>
            <li> The charge on this does not last and it is not very old.  I did read the reviews and I decided to try it anway. Maybe I should have listened...lol</li>
            <li> Returning this toothbrush despite its good reviews. I changed from Sonicare to try this brush, but it has a much lower frequency than Sonicare; this causes me to have dizziness and nausea when brushing my teeth. It also isn&#x27;t balanced correctly for a small hand and thus holding it isn&#x27;t that comfortable or natural. The round head is OK for a small mouth but I still prefer the oval Sonicare head. The 30-sec alerts work well. My new Sonicare is compact with a well-balanced handle and a better frequency.</li>
            <li> This is my first electric toothbrush and it works well. The timer is also a nice reminder so I don&#x27;t spend more time on one area of teeth and neglect another area.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t need the timer, but I wanted the ability to use the different brush heads. Unfortunately my previous Oral B toothbrush they stopped making brush heads for. So I bought this unit. It works great, does an excellent job. I went to the dentist and they commented how well my teeth look. So yeah, I&#x27;m happy with the product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been a fan of electric tooth brushes... this one is a mind blower!! Not that expensive and Im pretty sure the my dental bill will be happier :)</li>
            <li> The toothbrush works great so far. I was skeptical after reading reviews of the charger going out after 6 months. Hopefully that won&#x27;t happen. After having this for two months, the only issue is that there&#x27;s gunky stuff that accumulates on the charger around the area where the tooth brush sits. That area needs to be cleaned often, otherwise it stinks. I have no idea where the gunk comes from.</li>
            <li> I upgraded from an older oral-b model. I always feel like it cleans my teeth really well. Highly recommend it</li>
            <li> Fast, as described, and well packed!</li>
            <li> Only use Oral-B Tooth brushes.  This electric toothbrush does the job, and comes with a travel case which is a bonus!</li>
            <li> This is my first experience with an electric toothbrush with this kind of power and feature set, and it makes manual brushing seem like a waste of time. I&#x27;ve owned it for almost a year, here are my notes:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LCD Accessory Notes:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes with a battery-operated LCD-display accessory that shows -&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&gt; The mode you&#x27;re using&lt;br /&gt;&gt; A timer&lt;br /&gt;&gt; A clock&lt;br /&gt;&gt; And a warning indicator for when you&#x27;re pressing the brush against your teeth too hard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it a lot...until I realized I didn&#x27;t really need it for anything -&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&gt; I use the same mode all the time (and there&#x27;s enough brush-speed variance between the modes that you can tell which one you&#x27;re using)&lt;br /&gt;&gt; The brush stops rotating and beeps when it&#x27;s time to move to the next brushing area (if in \\&quot;Normal\\&quot; mode; 30 seconds, then 1 beep, another 30, then two beeps...all the way to 4 beeps, then it starts over)&lt;br /&gt;&gt; I don&#x27;t need the clock&lt;br /&gt;&gt; The brush has a red flashing light to warn you about the pressure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;AND...the communication between the brush and accessory uses a certain amount of battery life on both devices, but I never took the time to determine how much. I let the batteries wear out on the accessory two months ago and haven&#x27;t used it since.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other notes:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- The power button should definitely be put elsewhere. I&#x27;m used to it now, but it&#x27;s in a perfectly awkward spot; I mistakenly turned the brush off several times when I was first starting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- There are three bars on the brush to indicate battery strength; to go from a single blinking red bar to a fully charged brush takes somewhere between 18-24 hours. A full charge for me lasts about 4-5 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush is great, I&#x27;d definitely recommend it....but when the need arises for a new brush, I&#x27;ll go shopping for one that&#x27;s of comparable quality without the unnecessary accessory. Now that I say that.....being a new user, the accessory actually did help me get started. But if you&#x27;re an experienced user just shopping around, don&#x27;t let your decision hinge on the accessory.</li>
            <li> First impressions:&lt;br /&gt;1) Wow, does it need to be this loud?  The motor makes a sort of grinding sound that&#x27;s a lot louder than my prior toothbrush and not all that smooth.  More &amp;#34;Yugo&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;Geo Metro&amp;#34; than &amp;#34;Mercedes&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;2) The wireless display is constantly flashing messages at me. Why?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish:&lt;br /&gt;1) Smoother motor.&lt;br /&gt;2) It was clear in the product information that both the round and flat brush heads fit.  In fact any style fits, you don&#x27;t have to decide in advance what brush style is best for you.&lt;br /&gt;3) The bathroom is exactly where I need the clock to be accurate: the clock in the wireless display should be an atomic (automatic setting) variety.  If the wireless sensor was waterproof for the shower that would be even better.</li>
            <li> Works perfect allowes you a great teeth routition works great even with 220v electricity no problem at all bought the converter and that it</li>
            <li> Does a much better job keeping teeth clean than manual brushing. The timer is a convenient option and helps with thoroughness when your mind is elsewhere.</li>
            <li> I purchased this because it had great reviews. It works great I&#x27;ve already purchased several brush heads. For my needs and wants. It last a week with out being charged. The only thing is you&#x27;ll notice that the brush runs lower. The smart guide helps with brushing and the clock is good if you need to see the time. Mine came with the travel case broken but I didn&#x27;t mind because I don&#x27;t travel with it. This is just a side note you can put different brush heads in charger holder so you can use different heads for different times</li>
            <li> THE BEST PRODUCT ORAL-B</li>
            <li> All I know is since I have been using this toothbrush in addition to the sensodyne pronamel I get a lot of compliment about how white my teeth is. assume product.</li>
            <li> Had a Philips Sonicare: The replacement heads were like 3 times as expensive as the heads for this Orab B 5000 series system.  Sonicare ate batteries and finally stopped working altogether.  I was going to buy another Sonicare until I inspected this Orab B unit at a retail store.  It just looked and felt like the BMW, Mercedes-Benz, or Porsche of toothbrushes: A well made German quality tank of a toothbrush.  Performance is the best I have ever experienced.  Feels like I went and had my teeth polished at the dentists office clean.  I will be recommending this toothbrush to friends and family.  It is hard to imagine a better toothbrush, and the Amazon price is awesome.  Totally 110% recommended.</li>
            <li> I have really enjoyed using this product.  It works great and is so simple to use.  I have used other electronic toothbrushes but this is by far the best I have ever tried. worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Mom wanted it, she uses it everyday and loves it! Thanks oral-b for the great toothbrush with the included clock and heads.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  I feel like I&#x27;m getting a professional cleaning.  The monitor is very easy to read and follow.  Very good product and I would certainly recommend to friends and family!</li>
            <li> I was looking to replace my Sonicare (low end Essence) brush. My dentist suggested and had a great deal on an Oral B Professional Precision 5000. I purchased it not quite sure if I would like it more than Sonicare, but wiling to give it a chance.    PROS    - The whole system is a much better set-up, easier clean-up and more fun. My biggest complaint with my Sonicare Essence was clean-up. The Oral B Professional solves this problem very well and in my opinion better than most of the Sonicare brushes. The Oral B system uses brush heads that easily slip on and off the brush and the system includes a tray for each brush head - making it easy to remove, clean and store between brushes. This quality alone is what really sold me on the brush.    - Price. High end Oral B toothbrushes are much more affordable than Sonicare high end toothbrushes. As a bonus, brush head replacements are much more affordable than Sonicare replacement brush heads.    - Brush head selection and interchangeability. I love the brush head options. To date I have only tried the floss action head which I like, but I having the option to use any brush head great! So much better than the single option I had for the Sonicare Essence.    - The timer. The time is so much fun and helpful. While this alone would not have sold me on the brush, now that I have used it I don&#x27;t think I would to brush without it.    CONS    - The mechanical action Oral B uses is very different from Sonicare. I am still trying to get used to this. It&#x27;s not necessarily bad, just different (and my teeth feel as clean as ever).    - The floss action brush head seems a little large, okay actually it feels gigantic! Again I have only used the brush for a few days so I am sure I will get used to this, but right now it seems a little cumbersome.    Overall if you are trying to decide between the Oral B Professional 5000 and a Sonicare brush I would whole heartedly suggest going with Oral B - it&#x27;s a much more complete and cost effectivesystem.    UPDATE: After using my toothbrush for 1.5 years it stopped working, but Braun offers a 2 year warranty for this product! If you need to contact warranty support, call do not email. I never received a reply to my email. Once you are able to contact a customer service rep, the process is pretty simple. I am impressed they offer 2 years of support.</li>
            <li> The device works well&lt;br /&gt;the screen is nice but I would expect more elaborate statistics and information from this output screen. Considering the technology of today it could have been much more sophisticated and helpful without being more expensive - its a real shame.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nimo</li>
            <li> After using the Pulsonic (Oral b version of Sonicare) the wow factor was limited. However, it does feel as though there is significantly more movement on the tooth surface. It is very nice to have such a wide variety of heads to meet specific needs. Plus its nice to change it up every now and then. You do not have this option with a &amp;#34;sonic&amp;#34; type toothbrush. Aside from the fairly large handle the unit is pretty solid but without excessive weight. As long as the inside of the heads and motion shaft are kept clean after every use the toothbrush has kept looking and acting like new over the duration of use thus far. Automatic battery cut off when fully charged is a plus. Even shuts the lights off of the unit to limit electric draw. I do find that the pressure sensor to protect your gums is set way off. To set off the warning you&#x27;d have to purposefully be trying to sand off your gums. Overall a 4 because I still feel like it could be faster motion or more of a sonic motion. The pulsations seem pretty well set.</li>
            <li> I had been looking for a very long time for the best rechargeable electric  toothbrush I could find.  Well, I found it!  I did a lot of research and this one is the very best.  It has different speeds for great cleaning, whether you want deep cleaning to gentle cleaning for those with tender gums.  It comes with four toothbrush heads. I also bought additional Oral-B Sensitive (extra-soft brush heads) for my husband who has sensitive gums.  The battery lasts a long time and it recharges overnight.  The little clock that comes with it is a great help to let you know when to move to another part of your mouth so you do not overbrush.  You even get the &amp;#34;smiley face&amp;#34; to wink at you when you have brushed the recommended time.  My teeth never got this deeply cleaned with a regular toothbrush and my gums never get sore from overbrushing.  I would definately recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this toothbrush. After first use saw a difference. Timer very helpful...reminds you how long you are to brush. Should have purchased one years ago.</li>
            <li> This was recommended by my husband who had used one for several years.... since it was first introduced on the market.  I needed a new one and this meets my needs and exceed expectations.  Good teeth become much appreciated with the expanding years.  Good toothbrush is a leading reason!</li>
            <li> I have used other electric tooth brushes before but this one is so much better. It makes your mouth feel so clean, and the timer is a great feature.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item a week ago as an upgrade from the Oral B Vitality that I bought for approx 40-50 dollars a couple of years ago. The main reason I went for a new one was that the battery was only lasting 3-4 days after a charge and it was starting to look a bit ordinary. I went for the Precision 5000 because of the reviews on Amazon were mostly positive.&lt;br /&gt;I have to say I was dissappointed. The Precision 5000 is a alot heavier, noisier and has way more vibration, to the point of being annoying whilst brushing, especially when brushing behind the top front teeth. Feels like my whole skull is vibrating!&lt;br /&gt;At this stage I am going persist for a while to see if I get used to it. Failing that, I may have to go back to the old faithful Vitality and just use the new brush head and put up with recharging ever 3-4 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 1. have had this for approx 8 weeks now and have slowly, sort of gotten used to it. It still, however, a tad harsh vibration wise although as stated have become slightly acustomed to it. I still believe there is no difference in cleaning ability and the only reason i am still using it is because of the price i paid!</li>
            <li> What can you say about Oral B except they clean the teeth of America! My wife loves her Brush and it loves her too.</li>
            <li> My first Oral-B finally reached the end of the road after 4.5 years and I had to get another one. Once you use a brush like the Oral-B it is very hard to go back to a regular toothbrush. This one is more sophisticated than my last one and the brush actually stops and beeps briefly after the 30 second brushing interval for each quadrant. I like the smart guide timers with this brand which my old Oral-B had too. I would highly recommend this brush to anyone. And Amazon had it delivered to my door in a few days which worked out great!!!</li>
            <li> I love the toothbrush, but was quite irritated to find that it came with only 1 brush head (when I bought its predecessor I got 4 brushes).  The travel carrier is nice but could be a bit less bulky and sturdier.  I was delighted when I found that I could remove the charger from the stand which seems to me to be a counter space waster and awkward to use.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent machine, and I highly recommend it to anyone. The battery life has proved to be excellent too.</li>
            <li> This is a great tool for your teeth, easy to use,  Love the rechargeable battery, way better than the regular batteries, I don&#x27;t use the timer/clock thought..</li>
            <li> Makes me brush longer than I ever did. I didn&#x27;t know how briefly I was brushing. It also keeps me from brushing too hard. My daughter keeps tabs on the family, making sure we earn our stars and get happy faces! Ha! My dentist has remarked on how good my oral hygiene is now...kinda placed me among the most hygienic they see...and the only thing I changed in my routine is the toothbrush. Totally worth the money. Base is easier to clean than other Oral B brushes I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
            <li> Still loving brush action. I&#x27;ve completely stopped using my sonicare toothbrush in favor of this one. Where the Sonicare left things on my teeth, and i was kind of difficult to get on the inside, this toothbrush does thoroughly. Your teeth will still feel clean even after you&#x27;ve eaten. It does take AWHILE and I mean AWHILE to charge.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this product.</li>
            <li> One of the best things I have ever done for my mouth. This thing, with regular flossing, will do wonders. If mine goes tits up tomorrow, I with be picking up a new one by mid morning. No joke, they are that good.</li>
            <li> I have had it for about a month and I love it....A dental hygienist recommended it to me. It came when it was scheduled or before and it does exactly what it advertises it will do.  I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> This is a great toothbrush.  We&#x27;ve used Oral-B for years.  It was FINALLY time to replace our old one.  This one works great &amp; I love the new toothbrush storage.  MUCH better than previous styles.</li>
            <li> It&#x60;s a very good device but I hate its digital timer which is absuletly unnecessary and useless in my case.</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush, but the lack of a dual voltage charger is stupid.  As I live overseas, this is a problem.</li>
            <li> Would have given it five stars except that before buying it I did not know what the &amp;#34;smart guide&amp;#34; did. It sends a radio signal from the brush handle to the guide, and the guide displays brushing time plus the mode. Totally useless for me since I only use one mode. Preferred the &amp;#34;floss action&amp;#34; brush that came with this one and not the lower priced one that came with a brush I would not use. If you don&#x27;t need &amp;#34;fancy shmancy,&amp;#34; get the next lower priced one that operates exactly the same so far as rotation goes. Also, my old Oral-B brush indicated how much charge was left by an icon on the brush. This one will display a red light when the charge is getting low. Otherwise you don&#x27;t know how much charge is left.</li>
            <li> My husband and I both use this new toothbrush and are very satisfied with it. This is my first experience with an electric toothbrush and I&#x27;m so far impressed. It does seem to get my teeth significantly cleaner than manual brushing. The timer works really nicely, and it functions as a clock when you&#x27;re not brushing. I can&#x27;t imagine anything more I&#x27;d want out of a toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I had a slightly older model (can&#x27;t remember which) that I was replacing because it did not hold a charge very long anymore. The older one would decrease in power as the battery ran down, this one holds the charge evenly until it wears out- I like that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first I thought the little smiley face timer was unnecessary but I put it in my shower (where I brush) and it is a nice feature. Since it has a clock it helps me keep track of time and the little smiley face has grown on me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another thing I like is that when you press too hard is does not pause like the older one did, it just has a red light to let you know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Speaking of the pause it now pauses after every 30 seconds so I don&#x27;t have to keep an eye on the smiley face on the wall, I also like that feature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was a nice upgrade and I think I paid the same as I did for the older one a couple of years ago.&lt;br /&gt;Will buy again when this one dies.</li>
            <li> The Oral-B Precision 5000 is impressive.  It is solidly built.  They say it&#x27;s not waterproof, but it appears to be well sealed against casual water contact.  Plenty of power.  Long lasting built in rechargeable battery.  Lets you know with a beep and stops if you&#x27;re pressing too hard.  But then it automatically starts back up, so you don&#x27;t loose a lot of time.</li>
            <li> Good as far as I can tell however will know more after next dental check.</li>
            <li> Great i love it works like a charm, This will get you more ladies when they see your good smelling breath and white teeth.</li>
            <li> This is the second one we have purchased.  We are still using the first one but I feel it won&#x27;t last much longer.  I wouldn&#x27;t brush my teeth with anything else.  We love this product.</li>
            <li> Really does a great job at making my mouth feel cleaner. Hopefully my dentist will see an improvement too next time I go in for an appointment. It was based on her recommendation that I purchase this model</li>
            <li> Look, this is a great toothbrush.  Cleans teeth and gums splendidly.  The timer is an important addition, helps tremendously with uniformity of brushing.  And batteries last up to a week off charging stand - I know I took it on vacation several times.  BUT beware, after just over ONE year the batteries quit completely and are NOT user-replaceable.  I&#x27;ve replaced batteries on several models of ipods, so I know a few tricks but this one is fairly impossible to access without ruining the handle. So, still a great brush but keep the relatively short lifetime in mind as you consider the price.</li>
            <li> Best electric toothbrush I have ever purchased. This item comes with a separate digital display screen that will monitor the 2 minute brush warning. It will also tell you if you have not brushed your full two minutes. It will warn you if you are brushing in the same spot for too long. The toothbrush also has several settings for personal care and more. I definitely recommend this product, worth the money.</li>
            <li> I used to suffer from bleeding gums. Coupled with an Waterpik water flosser that I bought from Amazon as well, my teeth feel and look much healthier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used this product for over 2 months and it still feels great and gives you plenty of power to give a clean and powerful brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nothing but great things to say about this product, and you especially can&#x27;t beat Amazon&#x27;s prices and service.</li>
            <li> The Oral B Triumph Tooth Brush is one of the best tools for maintaining a healthy mouth.&lt;br /&gt;I have recommended this device for more than three years and I am continually amazed at results my patients are getting.  It is not uncommon to see a patient who has struggled to control gum disease, start using the brush and see the number of bleeding points drop dramatically and pockets also improve.&lt;br /&gt;The brush is easy to use for several reasons.  It has a changeable head so members of your family can share the brush by changing the head. It also allows different types of brushes so if you have a need to use a softer bristle brush, or have periodontal conditions, you can select one designed for your specific needs.  The battery charge will last about two weeks and doesn&#x27;t need to be kept on the charger.&lt;br /&gt;The timer included will help control the use of the brush by stopping every 30 seconds. This signals you to move to a different quarter of your mouth.  Four quarters equals two minutes: a good amount of time to spend brushing.&lt;br /&gt;It also has a button to lower the vibration level several steps so it can be less vigorous for more sensitive people&lt;br /&gt;I use one myself and believe every person wanting a healthier mouth to consider using one as part of an organized health regime.  [[ASIN:B0002KHU3I Oral-B Professional Dual Clean Replacement Brush Head 3 Count]]</li>
            <li> My dentist actually gave me one of these with my first periodontal visit. I needed a replacement charger and could not find one</li>
            <li> performs as stated. Does  a great job. Easy to use and not messy as some reviews have stated</li>
            <li> Very nice complex with timer (and time) and good brush. Maybe it could be more heads in starting complect. But anyway it&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li> This is my second Oral-B brush. My periodontist sold me the first one about 7 years ago and it has improved the state of my gums and teeth immeasurably. This one works even better than the first.</li>
            <li> Bought it for him as birthday present and he loves it! Already he has noticed a difference in his teeth. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> powerful, teeth feel really clean on all surfaces and in between! No doubt that your mouth is fresh. It is awesome.</li>
            <li> Everything I have ever had from Oral B is great</li>
            <li> The toothbrush is excellent but charger keeps failing. Had to replace two chargers already after 8 months of use. Now have to buy again another one.</li>
            <li> When my old Sonicare died, I did some research, and found this. It&#x27;s been great, and my last visit to the dentist was perfect.</li>
            <li> Top notch and professional. Does an excellent job. Difference in my teeth was noticed by the hygienist at my next visit. Excellent battery life for taking it on trips for up to a week.</li>
            <li> Good toothbrush. Really like the clock.</li>
            <li> like it, love it. the digital timer has  stars and smiley faces.  perfect for getting the little ones to brush for two minutes, sometimes more.  the battery lasts a long time between charges.  i&#x27;ve been diligent in getting my teeth cleaned every three months and my hygienist is seeing much improvements.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush works great. The different settings are helpful for different tyeps of brushing, my favorite being the deep clean setting.</li>
            <li> Works very well.  Teeth feel clean and smooth like a dental cleaning.  The timer is nice too.  Worth the money.</li>
            <li> Love it!&lt;br /&gt;Received as a gift &amp; my dental check ups have improved!</li>
            <li> The toothbrush is exactly what I wanted. It comes with a timer that notifies me every 30 seconds. This ensures that I brush as the dentist has instructed me. The timer sticks on my bathroom mirror and is also a clock. It has replaceable heads and because of this my husband and I share it, which really makes it even better. I would gladly recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> Even after the first use, it felt as though I had been to the dentist for a professional dental cleaning. I&#x27;ve only used the normal and sensitive settings but both work well and are noticeably different. I have sensitive teeth and thought I would need to use the sensitive setting on a regular basis. This hasn&#x27;t been the case. Overall a gentle cleaning that provides fantastic results. I have not experienced any of the normal plaque build up that I typically have between dental visits. (Just for perspective, I floss daily twice a day, see the dentist twice a year, and have never had a cavity.)</li>
            <li> The 5 modes are hardly necessary and offer very little different results, if any, in my experience. I use 2 modes at most. Except for that it works well.</li>
            <li> I like the quality plus the service</li>
            <li> Absolutely amazing.  Feels like you&#x27;ve had teeth cleaned by a dentist everyday.&lt;br /&gt;Great idea having the timer. Makes it almost fun!</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush--it is effective and cleans much better than any others I have used. The only downside is the goofy display. It is marginally useful at best and not necessary for properly using the brush.</li>
            <li> This is the best of all brands.  i was really surprised with the power.  It really cleaned my teeth and i recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m  delighted with my purchase of the Oral B electric took brush.  I wish that I had thought ahead and purchased extra brushes.</li>
            <li> Works great and happy with the case for travel especially.</li>
            <li> I never thought in a million years I would be writing a review for an electric toothbrush, but the Oral B Precision 5000 is about as good as it gets.  I&#x27;ve owned my share of electric dental appliances (Waterpiks, Sonicares, other Oral B brushes), but this really is the creme de la creme.  I&#x27;ve never felt \\&quot;dentist-clean\\&quot; after brushing my teeth until using this model.  Yes, some of the features are superfluous and you definitely don&#x27;t NEED to spend over $100 on a toothbrush, but this one gets the job done and then some!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The display screen is a separate device that you can set down on your counter or stick to the wall.  It shows you your progress and lets you know if you&#x27;re brushing too hard.  There are different modes (deep clean, sensitive, massage), but the standard mode works just as well.  It also scores your brushing based on how long you brush each time.</li>
            <li> Unlike some of the other reviewers, I haven&#x27;t used an electric toothbrush until recently.  I did not have braces as a child, so I have a lot of weird crowding and gaps, so I have found a Water Pik Ultra to be my tool of choice - it is unbeatable in terms of getting out bits of food.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My teeth are also somewhat sensitive, so I have avoided electric toothbrushes until recently, when I tried a Sonicare.  As my hygenist suggested, my teeth got somewhat more used to the vibration after using it for a few weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I received this Oral-B 5000 electric toothbrush for review.  My main area of need is avoiding gingivitis.  If your own main use is for whitening, you might want to skip to someone else&#x27;s review, because that is not particularly relevant to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the Oral-B 5000 for a number of weeks during the period of time after a hygenist cleaning where I usually start to accumulate some plaque.  I found the Oral-B effective in preventing that from happening.  My hunch is that the \\&quot;Floss Action\\&quot; brush head is part of this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also found the Oral-B more tolerable for my sensitive teeth than the Sonicare.  I used the Sonicare right after a cleaning, so it was too soon to say if it was equally effective (and I am now going to shift back to it, and will update my review later with those impressions).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In general, the Sonicare is more like the cleaning tool used by the hygenist.  It happens to have a toothbrush on the end, because that is what people are used to putting in their mouth.  But the main point seems to be to apply ultrasonic cleaning to your teeth, like your jeweler uses on old jewelry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In contrast, the Oral-B seems to be more designed to actually gets its bristles into spaces, and to massage your gums.  More motion, but less intense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, regarding the 5000 versus other Oral-B models.  Like others, I find a lot of the included accessories largely unnecessary.  The display doesn&#x27;t tell you any more than is communicated by the brush handles&#x27; pauses and beeps.  More importantly, these days we already have too many wireless devices that start interfering with each other.  Wifi, Dish Network remotes, Senn 180 wireless headphones and Logitech M510 mouse are all important to me, but adding anything more is a dubious proposition - especially if it is unnecessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, while I have not used the simpler models in the Oral-B \\&quot;Professional\\&quot; line, I would recommend that you consider those, especially since they look like a much better dollar value.</li>
            <li> Excellent product that, at the very least, gives me the impression that my teeth are much cleaner.  LCD display that comes with the unit is a little overkill, but as some people said, it&#x27;s a good way to let you know how long you need to brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One complaint is that the base on which you put the toothbrush heads doesn&#x27;t have a drain at the bottom, so a little water collects at the bottom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommend buying another cleaning toothbrush head for a more complete brushing (the default head that comes with the unit is the flossing one).</li>
            <li> Good oral hygiene is a must in our family.  I believe electric toothbrushes are the ONLY way to go especially for children.  We bought Oral B&#x27;s less expensive model but I wanted to try to see if this unit&#x27;s 5 different cleaning option would be better for me as I have a tendency to over brush and cause gum issues.  I initially bought this for myself and love it so much that I bought one for all of  my children.  The  \\&quot;Mr. Smiley\\&quot; mobile/clock device gives the children cues on where and how long they should brush.  They LOVE it!!!  If they love brushing their teeth, do it correctly and prevent cavities I am happy!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Oral B for making such a fabulous product.</li>
            <li> In two minutes you feel like you just got a cleaning from the dentist office.  It&#x27;s so professional, it&#x27;s unbelieveable.  Polishes and actually I think my teeth are whiter.  Plus, I don&#x27;t have the sensitivity I had when I used a regular toothbrush.  So, my gums are better also.  I just love it and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the [[ASIN:B008UKTJSG Braun Triumph Professional Care 9900 Power Toothbrush with Smart Guide]] for about four years, after finishing up some extensive dental restoration. My dentist had recommended it to me, and sure enough, since switching, I&#x27;ve had all of one cavity, and none of my checkups have involved breaking up nasty calculus bridges. On that alone, you&#x27;re doing yourself a favor by using any of the Braun/Oral-B professional series toothbrushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While some consider the LCD of dubious value, it&#x27;s really easy for bad habits to creep up, and two of mine were not brushing long enough, and brushing with too much force. The LCD solves both problems -- however -- these are two areas where Oral-B took a step back, and a step forward. The Triumph series would do a brief pause in between quadrants (you&#x27;re supposed to spend 30 seconds in each quadrant of your mouth), where the new Precision series stops and chirps like something&#x27;s gone wrong. On the plus side, the Precision 5000 brush actually lights up when you&#x27;re applying too much pressure. The Triumph series only blinked a recessed light on the LCD.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One big, wonderful design change is the holder for the individual brushes. On the Triumph series, moisture would collect at the base, and it would get gross without regular cleaning. This holder is a much simpler design that prevents accumulation, and that&#x27;s way easier to clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Speaking of cleaning... if you use any sort of restorative toothpaste (e.g. [[ASIN:B004TL900M Sensodyne Pronamel]]) you absolutely MUST make sure that the motor is clean after each use. Otherwise, the minerals will accumulate around the base, and the pressure sensor will break.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And since I&#x27;m giving out tips, getting replacement heads on Subscribe &amp; Save is a deal and a half, compared to any store I&#x27;ve been to. It doesn&#x27;t hurt to have a couple additional packs sent when they&#x27;re cheaper than usual, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Going back to welcome design changes, Oral-B has got away from the massive Braun plug that they used on previous models (and still use on Braun shavers) and instead uses a normal North American plug.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All things being equal, there&#x27;s usually some sort of rebate going on high-end Oral-B products, and if you can pick this up for less than a Benjamin, you&#x27;d do well to get in on that deal. Though, if you can find a Triumph on clearance for the same price, I&#x27;d jump all over it. This is a nice replacement, but the Triumph was a much better product, used the same brush heads, and only cost a few dollars more. In any case, the absence of drilling and scraping since Oral-B Professional products came in to my life makes this one of those rare unintentionally life-changing products.n changes, Oral-B has got away from the massive Braun plug that they used on previous models (and still use on Braun shavers) and instead uses a normal North American plug.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All things being equal, there&#x27;s usually some sort of rebate going on high-end Oral-B products, and if you can pick this up for less than a Benjamin, you&#x27;d do well to get in on that deal.

            <li> I received my SmartSeries 5000 with no problem. The problem was in the packaging, which was fine except the adhesive tape was missing. Also, I can&#x27;t set the time on the clock.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this toothbrush for about two years now and have enjoyed it. I think it does a wonderful job of keeping your teeth clean. Something, however, doesn&#x27;t set right with me about a toothbrush with a lithium battery that can&#x27;t be replaced. Yes, that&#x27;s right folks. Unless you own a soldering kit, a T6 screwdriver and possess the savvy to do basic electronics, you will eventually be tossing this thing into the garbage can or sending it off for \\&quot;repair\\&quot; (not sure what this costs or how many weeks it takes).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From a business perspective the company has created an ingenious model. They charge a stiff price for the toothbrush (lets face it, they aren&#x27;t cheap by any means) and expensive replacement heads. They design it with a soldered battery that prevents the consumer from replacing it themselves, ensuring that you either purchase another one or send it off to them for battery replacement. Capitalism at it&#x27;s finest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product itself is sound, but just be aware that you&#x27;re purchasing something with a battery that will eventually fail. You will not be able to replace it with ease or without a soldering kit. It will either need repaired or repurchased.</li>
            <li> With no less than five settings on the toothbrush itself and a wireless timer that tells you exactly how long to spend brushing the four quadrants of your mouth, I&#x27;d say that this is a product worth recommending just on the strength of those features alone. The package comes with everything you need, including a stand, charger and a hard plastic travel shell. The timer is a nifty little thing that activates the moment the toothbrush is activated and even tells you when you&#x27;re applying too much pressure as you brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like this toothbrush very much and if I had one caveat, it&#x27;s that the head may be a tad small. I asked my dentist about it and he said that generally he likes his brushes to cover a bit more of the tooth area and I&#x27;m in agreement with him in that. The toothbrush definitely does a good job in getting between the teeth and under the gums but something with a slightly bigger head might&#x27;ve made this product even better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, a good electric toothbrush set that you can&#x27;t go wrong with.</li>
            <li> I do like this new toothbrush from Oral-B. Previously I had [[ASIN:B000GBICYE Oral-B Vitality]], and [[ASIN:B003UKM9CO Oral-B Professional Healthy Clean Precision 1000]] toothbrushes, and this is a real improvement upon them. (Also the heads and chargers are interchangeable, that is a great bonus).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While you get the same basic electric brush, the question was whether the small improvements make up for the price difference, and the answer is a definite yes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1 - The receiver with the smiley face&lt;br /&gt;The first difference is the addition of the remote receiver. It follows and guides your brushing, and while the effect is only psychological, it really makes a difference. [[ASIN:B003UKM9CO Precision 1000]] already has four 30-seconds reminders to switch between different parts of your mouth (remember 2 minutes is the optimum time to brush), seeing them on a screen feels like a video game. Initially I thought this would only encourage kids, it turns out it has an effect on adults as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(It also shows the current brushing program (which is another addition), and the current time, bu the main attraction is getting the smiley face on it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2 - More brushing programs / options&lt;br /&gt;In addition to the regular 2 minutes program, there are additional options, for deep cleaning, sensitive teeth, etc. My [[ASIN:B003UKM9CO Precision 1000]] only worked at regular power, and [[ASIN:B000GBICYE Vitality]] was rather weak. Here you can choose the strength and the time of brushing among different options. This is a definite plus&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3 - Head storage&lt;br /&gt;Electric brush maintenance and cleaning is important. Since they all stay in vertical position, the remaining \\&quot;gunk\\&quot; flows down, and builds up on the handle, and other places. It is better to get the head out from time to time, and clean up everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The addition of the integrated head storage near the base is a real convenience. Now, each time I brush my teeth, I take thehead off, and then wash everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And, since there are four slots, depending on your preference, you might choose to share a single base among your family. Again it is just an option, and depends on your choice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4 - Refinements&lt;br /&gt;While the older models already have the essentials, this new brush clearly improves upon them. For example, the pressure warning (when you press the brush too much upon your teeth), now has a red light element as well. The 30 seconds and 2 minutes marks are now more definite, and there is an additional audio beep. The brush itself feels more sturdy, and so on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall if you are looking for a long term investment on your teeth (and you should, since they will hopefully be with you you entire life), I could recommend this product. If you looking for a budget one [[ASIN:B003UKM9CO Precision 1000]] would be an alternative.</li>
            <li> As a Oral-B Triumph 9900 user and a longtime Sonicare user prior to that, I was very impressed with the Oral-B Precision 5000. It makes a number of improvements over the the model I&#x27;m used to and there&#x27;s only one minor feature that I missed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The new SmartGuide is much better, with a hard pause between the 30-second intervals. The Triumph 9900 had a brief pause that you had react to quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The new charger design is smarter, allowing for easier cleaning. It also uses a standard-looking plug, as opposed to the Braun-style plug on the Triumph 9900.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A number of additional cleaning styles is included, given the toothbrush great versatility. This makes total sense. Everyone&#x27;s mouth is different and everyone has different cleaning needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only feature I miss from the 9900 is the charging indicator. The 5000 uses three simple LED lights to indicate battery life. The 9900 had an LCD display with four levels of charge. It&#x27;s a pretty minor issue, but I liked having more grades of battery life and being able to see the charge level without turning the toothbrush on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m extremely happy with this toothbrush. It&#x27;s great at cleaning, easier to use than its predecessor, and more versatile than prior models. It&#x27;s highly, highly recommended.</li>
            <li> finally! a trip to the dentist that didn&#x27;t hurt. This works great! Cleans teeth beautifully. Don&#x27;t know why I waited so long to get one of these. Will never be without again!</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush. I bought for my husband for Christmas. My only complaint is when my husband has to wake early and brushes his teeth. The brush emits a beep every 30 seconds or so. It&#x27;s really annoying!!</li>
            <li> I bought his to replace an older model Braun OralB Plaque Remover 3D that I got back in 2001 which finally gave up the ghost. I like this brush just as well and love the travel case that comes with it. There were several times when my old toothbrush would accidentally be activated in my bag and the battery would run out. I wish I would have bought the model below this one because I do not see the added &amp;#34;features&amp;#34; give enough of a benefit to justify the additional cost, but I still like the way my teeth feel after brushing with this toothbrush. Call me a geek but I do like watching the included timer to make sure I am giving all portions of my mouth its 30 seconds per quadrant.</li>
            <li> I personally have an older version, but just bought one for each of my Mom and sister.  After the very first use, my Mom said &amp;#34;my mouth feels so different -- very clean !&amp;#34;.  I *highly* recommend everyone get these, they are fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside is, this model doesn&#x27;t seem to come with all of the extra heads (tongue cleaner, tooth whitener, etc), only one of the regular heads.  I don&#x27;t think this is an issue, I have never used any of the other heads, and keep them in a drawer.</li>
            <li> This is my first electric toothbrush and I am so happy I made the purchase.  I have had it for a little over 2 weeks and have never had a better clean and the size of the head along with the oscillating action ensures better tartar and plaque removal, especially in those hard to reach areas.  I am only disappointed I didn&#x27;t purchase one sooner.  I have read some complaints about the floss action heads, but I personally love it.  Along with flossing and mouthwash, the floss action heads work great.  I will try to update this product further after a year of ownership.</li>
            <li> Having never written a review before for any product, I am not at all intimidated because this is such a wonderful invention. I have permanent retainers and it has been almost impossible for me to really floss well until I received my Oral-B. It&#x27;s like getting a professional cleaning every time I brush! As a bonus, my teeth are even whiter. I want to buy two more for my children&#x27;s families! Thank you so much Oral-B!</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended the Sonic Care system. His office has a box in the examining rooms. I did some research and found that the Oral-B was the number one top rated teeth cleaning system over-all. I purchased one and my teeth have never felt better. I made the right choice. Works like a charm, I wish I had gotten one sooner.</li>
            <li> well worth the money..  Blows away reg tootbrush.. Get it &amp; see. A WINNER....... will buy again for sure... WINNER</li>
            <li> I actually purchased this from my dentist about 3 years ago.  I still love it to this day! Works great and still in amazing condition! Definitely a must buy, I can never go back to those cheap drug store brushes ever again! Money well invested :)</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended me to get an electric toothbrush as he said that it cleans the best. I did my homework &amp; chose Oral B. I am so pleased with my choice. I use the 2 minute timer &amp; when I am finished, it feels like I just got my teeth cleaned at the dentist&#x27;s office. It does such a good cleaning that flossing is a breeze. It was avery good investment.</li>
            <li> What a mess.  Haven&#x27;t tried the toothbrushes as they&#x27;re going back.  Since the batteries have leaked inside the units, we&#x27;re suspicious there may be damage elsewhere from water exposure or ????</li>
            <li> No problems.&lt;br /&gt;Shipped quickly.&lt;br /&gt;Came as ordered.&lt;br /&gt;Works great, I like every aspect of it.  No complaints. It better than the Soni care.</li>
            <li> My review has 2 parts:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) The good:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to think electric toothbrushes were a waste of money until after I bought this one (on the recommendation of my dentist).  For 6 months it worked well and my teeth felt very clean after brushing.  I do think this particular one is pretty expensive and the handle is a bit bulky.  But I was mostly very happy w/ the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) The bad:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After 6 months my toothbrush stopped charging.  I&#x27;ve tried using different outlets and placing the brush in the cradle different ways.  It still won&#x27;t charge.  I went to Oral-B&#x27;s website for service (certainly at 6 months it still should be under warranty).  It sent me to Braun&#x27;s website since I guess Braun services Oral-B&#x27;s toothbrushes?  I tried dialing the number on a Saturday.  It said service was available Mon-Fri from like 9A-6P.  I tried calling during those hours and it was mostly a maze of pre-recorded messages (which made me wonder why those messages couldn&#x27;t play during the weekend).  I finally figured out how to email Braun.  I haven&#x27;t gotten a response yet 3 days later.  I tried emailing again today so we&#x27;ll see what happens.  I know they require my original receipt (which I can&#x27;t find) in order to do \\&quot;in warranty service\\&quot; plus I&#x27;ll have to pay shipping to their service center.  I live in New York but the nearest service center is in Watertown, MA.  So if I can find the receipt I&#x27;m then going to have to figure out how to package up my toothbrush and charger.  Then snail-mail it to Massachusetts (paying the shipping myself).  Then wait for them to repair (or more likely replace) it.  Then wait for them to ship it back to me.  For the $130 or so that I paid for it, to get 6 months of a working toothbrush is absolutely ridiculous.  The customer service is very difficult to get in touch with and again, the process of getting this thing fixed is going to be a real pain.  I&#x27;m probably going to end up just buying another electric toothbrush butI can say with certainty that it will NOT be an Oral-B or Braun toothbrush.  I hope this comment will save others from having the horrible experience of Braun customer support (and Oral-B&#x27;s shoddy craftsmanship).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess in their defense, I haven&#x27;t seen anyone else write about this issue so maybe I just had bad luck and got a \\&quot;lemon\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> First one lasted 6 years until my youngest thought he should bang it on the sink</li>
            <li> I had used one of these in the past so i had finally ordered one and it leaves your teeth feeling so clean.</li>
            <li> It really is the best electric toothbrush I&#x27;ve had. The batteries can be changed when are damaged (That is cool. Before you lost your teeth brush).</li>
            <li> So I really don&#x27;t like brushing my teeth. After the first use of this I actually felt like I had visited the dentist because of the cleanliness feeling. My teeth don&#x27;t look whiter or anything, but I know exactly how long I&#x27;ve brushed my teeth! The pressure indicator is a great feature, I still haven&#x27;t changed the original head on the toothbrush yet, which it has been a while. The smart guide tells you where to brush. . . I tried very hard to follow it but I feel 30 seconds per corner of your mouth is too close. I usually blow off the smart guide and brush all over for over 3 minutes, the smart guide made me go over it all again. The little brush stand that attaches comes on and off of the charging stand. The handle is pretty large, but not too large. The case it comes works well, and holds two removed brushes. This toothbrush is great, I see fantastic results.</li>
            <li> Got this for my wife since he old brush just wasn&#x27;t cutting it. I have the older version of this so I thought this would be perfect for her needs. It has multiple modes from tongue to whitening which changes the brush speed and pattern the speed is applied. This was and still is the best price you can find.</li>
            <li> It not only does a great cleaning but the easy use of the other features of this unit make it an over all grand slam in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Whats not to love - makes your teeth feel dentist clean. Teeth actually stay, that clean feel, longer than hand brushing. Invest in your health, in your self, so you can invest in others. Great product - Bit pricey but worth...</li>
            <li> Perfect toothbrush. I really like the timer that keeps you on task to brush all quadrants for total of two minutes.</li>
            <li> Very good and worth the money. Went to the Dentist last week and had a great check up. Was told my gums very healthy and no cavities with very little work needed from the hygienist. Have been the Oral B P-500 a little over a month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love the timer. I place it on my bathroom mirror and know when to switch sides and when the polish mode is on. Pricey but work it.</li>
            <li> The first time I used this toothbrush, my teeth felt they had been given a complete overhauling by a dentist. Some of the attachments - wireless smartguide, which is not only to help you brush the recommended two minutes, but also \\&quot;light up\\&quot; if you brush too hard - feel like overkill, meant to justify the $100+ pricetag. The metal plate grip gives this toothbrush a solid, and heavy - it is heavy to use, especially when compared with my current Oral B \\&quot;Vitality\\&quot; toothbrush, but on the flip side, the brush rotates and oscillates at a higher frequency than my current toothbrush. It is early days, but I also feel that it lasts longer on a single charge than my current toothbrush, which means if you go out of town for a few days, you needn&#x27;t carry the charger along. And, while on the topic of charging, this also has lights that show you how much the toothbrush has charged, which is not present on the other \\&quot;Vitality\\&quot; series toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I&#x27;m very satisfied with this toothbrush!</li>
            <li> The tooth brush lights up red when your brushing to hard because that&#x27;s unhealthy to do. The battery life is outstanding could let you brush ten days strait without charging. It also haves a timer so you will brush your teeth for the right amount of time. Most importantly your teeth will fill extra clean. This toothbrush does a lot of extra stuff but its worth it all for your health.</li>
            <li> Every time I use it, it feels like I just left the dentist! The display timer also helps me make sure I&#x27;m thorough.</li>
            <li> My dentist said I have excessively deep pockets around my teeth and recommended an electric toothbrush to prevent further damage which would lead to tooth loss.  After just two months of use, my dentist can already see the difference and my second deep pocket cleaning has been cancelled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 2 minute cycle is divided into four sections which I use to concentrate on each section of my teeth, making sure to hit all surfaces in the 30 seconds per section.  I&#x27;m not a child but brushing with a regular toothbrush never resulted in all my teeth getting cleaned, so the audio and visual aids in brushing really do the trick for me.</li>
            <li> My second oral-b and we love it.  Would have given it 5 stars, but the first one stopped working after 2 years, and never got the rebate on this new one we bought.</li>
            <li> I really like this toothbrush. I have a basic level Oral-B electric toothbrush and while it performed well it didn&#x27;t offer me much comfort with my main concern of receding gumlines. This toothbrush has a remote pressure detector which I have never seen before, and it is a neat feature, particularly helping me identify those areas I have been brushing too hard where I didnt realize I was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also love the improved tray to protect the brush heads. My old one had a small base and would tip over and Id have to store my expensive brush heads in a drawer somewhere. These stay accessible, clean, and I keep better track of my supply. The case allows me to easily travel with it, which is often, and its very well protected. This toothbrush is totally worth the price, compatible with the whole Oral B selection of brushes, and is overall a great product.</li>
            <li> An excellent product. Cleans well and doesn&#x27;t irritate your gums.. Would recommend it without hesitation. Especially like the indicator that shows if you are pressing too hard.</li>
            <li> This works soooo much better than your typical manual toothbrush. The digital screen it comes with works very well and makes sure you do a good job cleaning. I can really feel the difference and hopefully on my next dentist visit they will too &#x3D;O Best use of a gift card all year &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> I am not sure how I gone without this. This is absolutely great my dentist has actually seen a improvement in my teeth since I started using this. My teeth are whiter and it has gotten me into a habit of brushing for the recommended 2 min, i have actually been brushing for about 3 to 4 min now.</li>
            <li> My teeth have never felt this clean on a daily basis with any other brush, manual or electric. It is worth every penny spent and I would highly recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> I replaced an older Oral-B unit that I had used for several years. Wasn&#x27;t sure I needed, or wanted, the bells and whistle&#x27;s that the new one has but I tried it anyway. This is much more heavy duty than the older model. Took a few times to get used to it but I am very happy that I made the switch. This model does a more thorough job of cleaning and is has some flexibility that my old unit does not.</li>
            <li> I love getting a good cleaning in 2 minutes. The wireless charging base is pretty cool too. My spouse and I share the same handle and we each have our own brush heads. The brush heads come with customizable color bands also..</li>
            <li> My husband loves the toothbrush, but it is not worth the extra money for the extras.  The Precision 4000 does the job just as well.</li>
            <li> The stand holds four of the interchangeable brush heads which makes this perfect for family use. Of course you could have more kept in another place if your family was larger. The clock/timer gives immediate easy to understand feedback even a small child could understand. This was well worth the cost and this brand is the best I&#x27;ve found. I replaced a four year old unit only because I wanted the easy to switch out heads and the ability to use various brush styles. Oral B will be the brand in our home.</li>
            <li> Got this on a special sale.  So glad I bit the bullet and went for it.  Teeth feel and look great and dentist has noticed a difference.  Will never use a regular tooth brush or spinbrush again.</li>
            <li> As someone who has used a traditional toothbrush for her entire life, I was astounded at how much cleaner my entire mouth felt after using the Oral B Professional toothbrush. It has some really great features to ensure that you brush properly and for the right amount of time. The brush heads are easy to replace, and there are many different types of heads to suit different oral care needs. Do take note that this toothbrush requires a full 24 hour charge before using, and I have found that even with just me using it twice a day for 2-3 minutes each time, it requires a full recharge every 5 - 6 days. All in all, it is an excellent product and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Oral-B 3000 for a couple of years and have noticed a definite improvement in the health of my teeth. Even the dentist has noticed the reduction in plaque, etc. Thanks to Amazon Vine, I have since upgraded to the 5000 thousand model, and I love it. Here&#x27;s my take on the 3000 vs 5000:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* The 5000 feels a little bit more powerful, and it has a longer battery life as well.&lt;br /&gt;* The 5000 have a few more modes, such as deep clean (just a longer cycle), and for massaging the gums. I don&#x27;t really use them.&lt;br /&gt;* Whereas the 3000 hesitates the spinning brush every 30 seconds to let you know to move on to the next quadrant, the 5000 also makes a beep. I find this annoying, especially late at night when I&#x27;m trying to not disturb my housemates.&lt;br /&gt;* I never use the bells &amp; whistles on the 5000. The clock which counts up your brushing time probably adds quite a bit of cost to this, and isn&#x27;t necessary at all. I recommend getting one of the lesser models of Oral-B without the frills.</li>
            <li> I had to buy a new electric toothbrush when my Sonicare was lost at a hotel.  After some research i Landed on this product.  So far I am ver impressed with the quality of clean that the product provides.  It is also MUCH easier to clean.  Because it is a closed system, there is no fear of mold or gunk gathering in the handle or brush screw parts (a constant problem with my sonicare).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love my new brush</li>
            <li> It works great and cleans well.  I really like how it beeps to tell you to go on.  This is one of the best.</li>
            <li> First time I have uses a power tooth brush and I do like it. It do like the timer with the 5000.</li>
            <li> The only issue is that the battery needs to be recharged every week. The book indicates that it will remain charged for two weeks assuming (2) two minute brushings per day.</li>
            <li> I was hoping for more spin. Also not using the timer.  Seems excessive. I do not like the constant slowing down of the spinner.</li>
            <li> This is a great toothbrush with great power.  My mouth feels cleaner than with any other toothbrush.  It arrived quickly and was new in the package</li>
            <li> I bought this on advice from my dentist, have been using a sonic for years. I really didn&#x27;t think I would see any difference, other than that it was easier for me to use as the brush is smaller (easier and neater to brush behind teeth. Well I was surprised to find upon first use that my teeth felt slick and clean, like they do after a dentist cleaning. Also, I have apparently been brushing to hard -- this brush lets you know right away if you are brushing too hard. Please consider this toothbrush the next time you need to get a new one. I&#x27;m extremely happy!</li>
            <li> Oral hygienist told me she wishes every patient had a clean mouth like mine and I attribute that to this tooth brush. Does a wonderful job. Easy to use and the timer is great - it even does double duty as a nice small clock in the bathroom.</li>
            <li> My teeth feels the same as after a dental cleaning!!! I will recommend this product to anyone who wants to have healthy teeth.</li>
            <li> I never thought I&#x27;d find myself using the words \\&quot;love\\&quot; and \\&quot;toothbrush\\&quot; in the same sentence.  I also never thought I&#x27;d spend $100 on a toothbrush, but I&#x27;m very glad I did.  The product is well made, charges fast, and works great.  Packaging was easy to open and everything was easy to assemble.  I love how my mouth feels after I use it.  I also like the different modes...not sure if they actually do anything, but they are fun.  And silly as it may sound, it feels good to always get a \\&quot;five star\\&quot; brushing in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely worth the money.  Hopefully my dentist will agree at my next check-up!</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is worth every cent! The charge lasts quite a long time, and my teeth are CLEAN! Highly reccommended!</li>
            <li> Oral hygiene is improving since I got this brush. It takes some getting used to. I am definitely getting some value from it.</li>
            <li> I have been in love with the Braun Oral-B electric toothbrush since I bought my first in the early 1990s. The technology has improved considerably since then, but what has really improved is the ease of cleaning the unit; until newer models like this, it was almost impossible to clean the brush holder and the scum build-up was both maddening and unhealthful. I had tried all sorts of implements to clean the older units, and nothing could get at the scum and effectively clean it. It took hours of frustration to get the unit almost sorta clean. Thank God I now have an electric toothbrush that has my teeth feeling clean all the time, and an apparatus that is easy to clean and therefore always clean now.</li>
            <li> I bought two of these toothbrushes, one for me and one for my wife.  The toothbrushes themselves are phenomenal!!  The best toothbrushes we have ever used. However, the automatic cutoff for brushing too hard is just about the most irritating feature I have ever seen for any product I have ever used ever.  It almost ruins everything good about this toothbrush.  The problem is the over brushing is not determined correctly.  It is highly dependent on angle and such of the brush and where or how this tooth brush determines the over brushing is not right.  The pressure can be greater with no detection, or much less than too much and the tooth brush shuts down.  It just doesn&#x27;t do it right.  And even if I over brush or brush too hard or whatever, I don&#x27;t ever want a toothbrush that cuts off on its own again.  I am telling you, it is like the most irritating thing I have ever seen in a product, and my wife agrees.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The little digital display thing that comes with the toothbrush I have never used with either of the toothbrushes.  I am sure a lot of the extra cost of this model went for that useless piece of junk too.  The problem with it is my wife spent about a half hour trying to figure out how to put the batteries in it and gave up.  I am an engineer, so her giving up and my finally fixing whatever is not an unusual situation.  But when I spent a half hour and couldn&#x27;t figure out how to get the battery cover off the d@mn thing, well it went in the closet.  So, all I have ever used is the toothbrush itself.  The instructions were less than useless in this effort as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The multiple settings on the toothbrush are the second most irritating feature on a product ever.  I am forever brushing my teeth and all of the sudden the toothbrush slows down or gets choppy because my fingers hit the button to change the speed or mode or whatever it is.  I HATE that button and will probably try to remove it or disable it.  I only ever use the highest speed mode anyway, and don&#x27;t really see a purpose for the other modes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, all in all, a terrible product with horrible irritating features that I would never ever waste my money on again.  However, it is the single best toothbrush I have ever used.  I just wish I had bought a cheaper model without all of the &amp;#34;useful features&amp;#34;, I think I would have been a lot happier!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve wanted this for over a year and I finally got it at Amazon for a really good price. It really feels like i&#x27;ve had a professional cleaning and it&#x27;s very easy to use. Great product!</li>
            <li> I thought my last Oral B electric toothbrush was amazing. I finally had to retire it after a 15 year commitment. When I replaced it with the \\&quot;Precision 5000\\&quot; my life was instantly changed. I&#x27;ve tried Sonicare toothbrushes, but they couldn&#x27;t stand alone as my only toothbrush. My teeth never felt totally clean. The Oral B Professional, makes your teeth feel like you just left the dentist. To be honest, I only floss on rare occasions, but because of the use of this toothbrush I fooled my dentist. The hygienist looked at my teeth and said \\&quot;obviously to floss everyday...\\&quot; You&#x27;ll see immediate and long term results from this product. My ONLY disappointment was that when I bought the package listed on Amazon it said it included a \\&quot;refill\\&quot; head for the toothbrush. Because of this, I made the error of assuming that it came with a standard brush head and an additional replacement. It only came with one, single brush head.</li>
            <li> I ordered this.  It did not include a single brush head.&lt;br /&gt;I have no idea if it works or not.</li>
            <li> This is a great toothbrush. It has a timer, which helps you brush for the amount of time you are supposed to, As well as a guide to the quadrants of your mouth. Excellent purchase, well worth it!</li>
            <li> I read the reviews and was a little hesitant but was pleasantly surprised at how easy set up was without reading directions.&lt;br /&gt;My 12 yr old doesn&#x27;t complain about brushing teeth and I can tell when he misses places as the areas that are clean &amp;#34;sparkle&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;The timer is an awesome way of telling how long you have been brushing. there is no way people brush 2 minutes unless they keep a clock next to them.  This is a great device and have had zero problems with it.</li>
            <li> This was a gift but daughter has said she loves it and has not had any problems.  It has a timer indicator for two minutes of brushing, she amusingly stated she mentally gets alot of planning mapped out for the day.</li>
            <li> This is pretty awesome. It does what it says it does. only been using it for a few nights but DAMN! This be good :) THANKS guys!!!</li>
            <li> Excellent. Would be great for a single person. Minimal gadgets to mess with for MAXIMUM RESULTS! Shaves close, leaves skin feeling smooth with no cuts or nicks..</li>
            <li> Had it for ashort while. so far so good. will see how long it lasts. otherwise it is better than mannual brushing.</li>
            <li> Certainly i recommend this product for everyone, it do a great job in cleaning and whiting your teeth ,&lt;br /&gt;just combine it with Crest 3D white Luxe advance vivid</li>
            <li> We love this toothbrush.  I thought my Sonic was great but this one has it beat by a mile.  I have a dental appointment coming up shortly - hope my hygenist agrees that my gums are healthier than they have ever been.  I highly recommend this toothbrush - it&#x27;s worth the money!</li>
            <li> I had another oral B electric tooth brush which was great but this one is the best and coouldn&#x27;t be better&lt;br /&gt;I love the flossing feature especially,as well as the timing. I just love  everything about this toothbrush&lt;br /&gt;and I would definately recommend this tothbrush to anyone who wants smooth feeling teeth and a clean mouth.</li>
            <li> This is a great buy and makes your teeth so clean and helps so much if you have gum disease!!</li>
            <li> Love the toothbrush, very efficient brushing, pauses when it&#x27;s time to change quadrants. I haven&#x27;t had much success with the display unit, it seemed to never turn off and was always counting down. I ended up removing the batteries and stored the unit away. The travel case has been handy, but you have to remove the brush and store both pieces side by side in the case. I bought my daughter the 1000 model at the same time I purchased this. Should have just saved the $ and bought the 1000 model. Hers does basically the same thing, just didn&#x27;t come with the display unit or travel case.</li>
            <li> My wife and I both went to the dentist and he recommended this product too us. However buying from him we would have gotten 4 heads and when buying this one we only got 2 heads. So after buying 2 more heads we ended up spending about the same. We did save on not paying any tax.</li>
            <li> Meets my expectations and does a fine job of cleaning my teeth. I have three of the several types of brush heads and am fully satisfied with their unique performance.</li>
            <li> Been using this since I bought it and I&#x27;m very happy with this product. I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is amazing! Brushing has never left my teeth feeling so clean. I live the timer that helps me be sure to brush for the right amount of time! Love it!</li>
            <li> I was a bit hesitant to purchase this toothbrush due to the cost, but I have no regrets at all.  It takes only a short period of time to see and feel the difference in your teeth and how clean your entire mouth feels.  It also reduces halotosis (for those who are too embarrased to admit they have bad breath).  It quickly and easily helps remove plaque and tartar and gives your teeth a clean shine.  I have absolutely no problems with this product only to say I wish I had purchased it years ago.  Could have saved money in the dentist office.  The travel case is very convenient and holds the items securely.  I haven&#x27;t been able to get the smart guide screen to come on, but I don&#x27;t feel that is a problem.  I know how to brush my teeth and don&#x27;t need a smiley face.  The toothbrush required more time to charge (the first time) than I expected, but was worth the wait.  I think it took about 2 days to charge the first time, but now it usually gets a full charge overnight.  I have used my Oral B for 4 months and will continue to use this great product.  It&#x27;s a worthwhile investment.</li>
            <li> I like this toothbrush.  It keeps you on-track to brushing all four quadrants of your mouth equally, and will also notify you if you are pressing down too hard when brushing.  While I really like this product and recommend it highly, the one beef I have is with the location of the secondary button.  The product has a primary button that turns the unit on/off, and a secondary button that causes it to jump from mouth-zone to mouth-zone.  Essentially, the secondary button&#x27;s physical location makes it very easy to press accidentally.  It&#x27;s not a major problem and doesn&#x27;t stop you from continuing with your brushing, but it does shift the time counter that accompanies the unit.  Just a minor annoying problem that I&#x27;ve adjusted to by holding the unit differently.</li>
            <li> Leaves teeth feeling extra clean and smooth.  Works better than Phillips Sonicare by far.  Happy with purchase and timer is extremely helpful, even has a pressure meter.</li>
            <li> Used the prior version for many years until the battery went out. Very please with this upgrade. Very usable. Recommended.</li>
            <li> This product is absolutely amazing! My coworkers and friends were talking about it and they all have it. Its crazy how much cleaner and healthier your teeth feel from just using it a short time. I am so glad I got this. Well worth buying it. I would highly recommend this!</li>
            <li> OK, again 1st the caveats. Oral-B user of over 20 years. My original Oral-B40 just recently died after 20 years of daily use by two people (crack at brushhead attachment, still works though) so i bought the current model of my original and one of these new imiproved more powerful ones, the Precision 5000, the 4000 is the same brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short, I love and prefer this newer model which is roughly 50-100% more oscillations. It&#x27;s also a bit heavier and therefore actually easier to hold with that heft. If you are used to most any electric toothbrush, you will love this puppy. If you are new to them, it may provide a bit too much buzz for you to immediately become comfortable with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the 5000 model goes, the brush itself and case holder are great. The remote timer thing is just an over the top unneccessary piece of glam, in my humble opinion. If I had it to do again from the beginning, I&#x27;d purchase the least expensive version of this model brush, which I think is the 4000. Gives you all of the good and no wasted expense on stuff of no value to your tooth health (again, in my humble opinion).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would say the Oral-B brand of brushes are far superior to any other regardless of the hype (I&#x27;ve used the other brands on &#x27;test&#x27; drives and just really prefer the cleaning action of these babies, but again, I&#x27;m a 20 yr plus oral-B user.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With such use, I still have all my own teeth, a decent smile, etc. etc. (I also floss, and use the gum twixt teeth brushees)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So bottom line, would give a 5 plus rating to the 4000 precision model though what i purchased was the 5000 model with the remote thing of no personal use to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also note, 20+ yr user of the Precision Clean brush head. I prefer that over the new &#x27;floss&#x27; or other head.</li>
            <li> Boy, what a difference about 8 years makes.&lt;br /&gt;This electric toothbrush is terrific.&lt;br /&gt;At first I thought the timer/pressure sensor was hokey, but then I realized when using it that a) I was pressing too hard on my teeth (because the electronic timer shows a sad face when you are pressing too hard) and b) that I was not brushing long enough.  The timer recommends a solid 2 minutes.  I was brushing about a solid minute.  So, I have upped the time, when I have time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the first cleaning, I could tell a big difference compared to a manual toothbrush (which I had been using because my older one broke.)  My teeth are super smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I am not sharing this with anyone, I am not using the toothbrush holder, so the unit takes up very little space on my sink counter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this and will use the travel case when I travel.</li>
            <li> After my approx. 5 years old Oral-B (some old and less professional model) has passed away, after serving me loyally&lt;br /&gt;it was time to move and. I decided to go for one of the crown&#x27;s jewels (IMHO).  After about a month of use, I generally wold say I am satisfied with this purchase.&lt;br /&gt;Prons:&lt;br /&gt;- excellent brushing. showed results within days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conts:&lt;br /&gt;- discharges very quickly (need to charge every 5-6 days, with the 3min program that I usually do)&lt;br /&gt;- a bit cumbersome; its size and weight make somewhat uncomfortable to hold Although no problem for adults, for children this is likely to be an obstacle.</li>
            <li> I looked everywhere to get this model.  Love it exact model I was looking for.  Other stores had wrong model.</li>
            <li> My wife and I have both had different versions of the sonicare toothbrushes over the last five years to include their &amp;#34;top-of-the-line&amp;#34; model.  This has worked so much better for us.  I feel like it is much better at cleaning my teeth and the separate timer is better at motivating me to complete the full two minutes of brushing.</li>
            <li> I have owned this product for one month.  I use it twice a day. I am very pleased with its performance.  My teeth feel much cleaner after using the Oral-B tooth brush than it does after using the manual tooth brush. It actually makes you feel like a daily cleaning at the dentist. So far it is fantastic.</li>
            <li> Love it!  Replaced an older model that I had for years!&lt;br /&gt;It delivers all that it promises.  Don&#x27;t hesitate to buy it.&lt;br /&gt;It is worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Great product. Easy to use and cleans well. Extra bonus is that it has prevented my teeth from staining in between dental cleanings. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Love this tooth brush, the initial charging took over 24 hours to charge, but worth the wait.  This replaced a very high end Sonicare, and I really am pleased with the change.</li>
            <li> Finally gave into buying this when I realized that I was brushing too hard and was wearing down the enamel of my teeth. Had to get three fillings by the gum line on one side of my mouth due to this reason. So I turned to Braun because they make the best products and Oral B is from their line of products. Must say, I haven&#x27;t had any bleeding gums or sensitivity since I started using this brush. I&#x27;m quite happy with the different settings and also the different settings from time to time for deep cleaning and massaging my gums. My teeth feel really clean. I&#x27;ve ordered different heads to try out as well based on reviews. Have yet to try them but I&#x27;m sure they will be fine.</li>
            <li> First off, my teeth feel soooo clean all the time now... Not just after the dentist cleaning&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It provides a real reality check on how long you should be brushing your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyone should have this product or something similar</li>
            <li> After three months use the Battery will only charge to 2 of the 3 bars on the toothbrush display...so basically in a few more months, wont charge at all!!!</li>
            <li> This is my first electric toothbrush, recommended to me by my family dentist and oral hygienist. I like it very much. I usually use the sensitive setting because my gums are sensitive to the normal setting. When I brush my tongue, it gets all white bad breath-causing stuff off. Overall, I like this toothbrush. Works great.</li>
            <li> excellent tooth brush .  most professional.  good deal too.</li>
            <li> I really love it.  It works better than my old Philips (over 100 bucks) one.  When you use this, it doesn&#x27;t make a mess.  I really enjoyed it a lot.  Would recommend!</li>
            <li> After 2+ years of keeping my teeth completely cavity-free, I think this toothbrush deserves a review at least.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is an excellent, low-maintenance brush that works just as well for me as it did when I first got it. Dry it off after each use, discharge the battery once every few months, and it&#x27;s perfectly happy. The set I got came with two \\&quot;normal\\&quot; heads, a super soft one, and one meant to reach hard-to-get crevices. I&#x27;ve used the latter two about twice. They really aren&#x27;t useful at all unless you have very sensitive teeth. In addition, the four \\&quot;modes\\&quot; of the brush are just unnecessary fluff as well. I&#x27;ve never needed anything more than the first mode and I couldn&#x27;t be happier with the way it cleans.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t even get me started on the SmartGuide thing...the battery ran out after about two weeks and I never replaced it. The brush will pause/pulsate for a second by itself once you hit 2 min, and then every 30 secs after that, so there&#x27;s no need for a timer. Plus, the sensor that is supposed to go off when you&#x27;re brushing too hard is not sensitive at all! You have to press down extremely hard in order to activate it, and by that point you&#x27;re already damaging your brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, 5/5 for an incredibly effective brush! I&#x27;ve literally never gotten another cavity again after I started using it..and I eat a LOT of sweets;) However, all these features they add on to justify raising the price are not very useful at all.</li>
            <li> It works ver well. The clock is very nice and easy to switch mode. Not truly a travel brush. That&#x27;s why 4 stars</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say enuf good about this coupled with water pic.  My hygienist complimented me on my clean healthy teeth and gums since using this and water pic.  My teeth feel like I had a professional cleaning every day.</li>
            <li> My teeth had never look better and cleaner. It is easy to use and the machine hints ensure a thorough cleaning.</li>
            <li> I had the previous version for many years and the battery gave out. So it was time for an upgrade. This works the same and it appears the battery is now designed for easier replacement.</li>
            <li> I have alway used an electric tooth brush and I really like the way this on cleans my teeth.  It works great.Cleans and flosses at the same time.  I am sure my Dentist will  be pleased with my new tooth Care.</li>
            <li> I received a  dental professional version of this toothbrush in dentral school.  opened the box to find out that the brush doesn&#x27;t even charge/light up.  I will not recommend this product to my patients or any one else.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush gets my teeth quite clean.  I like all the goodies that came with it, including the case and the bathroom clock (also timer for brushing).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find that the brush does induce a little gag reflex periodically, which I never encountered with a manual brush.  I&#x27;m hoping that&#x27;s just because of the larger brush head that causes me to open my mouth farther and that it will pass as I become more accustomed to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it gets my teeth very clean. The flashing lights for over brushing are great. I could probably do without the quadrant pauses, but I suppose they do have the desired effect.</li>
            <li> This is a great toothbrush.  It would be great also for kids since it has a timer so they brush their teeth long enough.  Highly recommend for anyone.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush makes brushing effortless.  The 30 sec timer per quadrant makes sure you get good coverage for all teeth.  The power is just right.  The flossing brushes do their job but true flossing with floss is needed at least once every other day in my opinion.  This is an excellent oral hygiene product.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t  be happier with the performance.  Must be careful with 84 year old neurosurgeon father with pacemaker/defibrullator] , because of transmitter to LCD display. Otherwise, Best toothbrush of its kind.</li>
            <li> Used another brand for years. When the battery died, it could not be replaced. So we decided to try another. Glad we saw all the good reviews and decided to try it. It is great! Has made mine and my husband&#x27;s teeth look cleaner and whiter. The floss action really works for hard to reach teeth. We&#x27;ve had it over a year and have not had to replace the battery yet. Highly recommend this!</li>
            <li> Easy to setup &amp; use.  It has the wireless assist that has the current time and tells you how long to brush each quadrant in your mouth.  It also lets you know when to replace the brush heads that you can purchase on Amazon.com or your local grocery store.</li>
            <li> This product exceded my expectations, it cleans great and has a timer to ensure that you brush the recommended amount of time.</li>
            <li> I love this new brush! I feel like I went to the dentist every time I brush my teeth. There are different options and it times each section of my mouth. I wish I had bought this sooner! I haven&#x27;t gotten a cavity since switching (about 4 years now).</li>
            <li> This brush is even better than the Phillips Sonic Care! I would highly recommend this brush to anybody. Do not hesitate to purchase.</li>
            <li> Great product, Love it. Digital timer helps you remember not to short change your brushing time. Also hold charge for a long time</li>
            <li> Very fast, love the options, the add on tray is useful, allowing my husband and I to store our toothbrushes neatly right next to the toothbrush.  Best of all is that the rechargeable battery is replaceable.  The original Oral-B electric toothbrush I used, while effective, had to be replaced when it stopped recharging completely.  With this model, I don&#x27;t have to worry about throwing out a toothbrush because the battery won&#x27;t recharge, as I can just replace it.  Well worth the money!</li>
            <li> This toothbrush gives a good cleaning and is exactly as described. It is constructed of high quality materials and has a durable, solid feel to it. The SmartGuideA is a useful tool that adds to the overall experience. The toothbrush itself makes sure you&#x27;re brushing at the appropriate proximity to your teeth without applying too much pressure. If too much pressure is applied, a sensor will stop the motor for about two seconds and the toothbrush will beep. In time, I learned the right amount of pressure to apply, thanks to this sensor, and the sensor no longer interrupts my brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The motor is powerful, especially when fully charged. However, the power of the motor is dependent on the battery life. It&#x27;s not an &amp;#34;all or nothing&amp;#34; response, but rather there&#x27;s a decrease in strength of the brush movements when the battery is halfway finished. Also, the battery does not last as long as I would have liked. I brush twice a day and do not recharge it until it is almost dead. That said, the battery lasts for over a week without a recharge; I would have preferred longer. The charger itself is very convenient, lightweight, and subtle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I would absolutely recommend this product. It&#x27;s the best electric toothbrush I have ever owned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Thorough cleaning&lt;br /&gt;- Durable, high quality toothbrush&lt;br /&gt;- SmartGuideA feedback&lt;br /&gt;- Pressure sensor&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- Short battery life</li>
            <li> this toothbrush works really well.  Very smart too with the bluetooth accessory keeps track of your time brushing.  Also good for kids since it has the light up sensor if you push too hard.  This was a replacement for a 10 year old ORAL B similar style so I expect good quality and long life again.</li>
            <li> We have multiple versions of Sonicare and Oral B brushes in our house.  Before switching to this Oral B I was using a Sonicare so I will compare the two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Sonicare advantages&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush handle is smaller so feels less bulky in your hand and is easier to maneuver than the Oral B.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is definitely quieter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush head is easier to get in to the tight spaces  on my back teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This really is better for smaller mouths, my kids were only able to start using an Oral B when they got to be about 12.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush handle weighs less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It feels gentler in your mouth than the Oral B and on sensitive teeth it bothers me less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Oral B advantages&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Teeth feel even cleaner after brushing (and this is the point of toothbrushes)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The replacement heads are a little cheaper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are lazy, this toothbrush seems to do more of the work for you.  Just move it from tooth to tooth. With the Sonicare you actually need to brush a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does not stop after the 2 minutes (or the setting ) so you can go on brushing as long as you like without restarting a whole cycle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The orthodontist wants my kids using an Oral B while in braces, as he says it cleans better with the floss action than a Sonicare around all that hardware.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As to the Smart guide, this would be an excellent feature for kids.  The timer and the smiley face provide visual feedback for the  younger set.  Two minutes feels like a long time when brushing to adults, to kids it is like eons.  However, this is overkill for most people who do not need a star system in order to brush their teeth.  I do like the warning when you are brushing too hard on the handle.  And it does default to a clock when you are not using it, a feature I find myself using pretty often.  However, I would not be willing to pay extra for the Smart Guide for an adult.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The manual could use some more clarity.  I understand that pictures mean the manual can be used in any language, but some clarifying text really would be nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short, I like both the Sonicare and the Oral B as each have their own advantages and disadvantages but both are excellent toothbrushes and a big upgrade from manual..

            <li> I guess this is as good as it gets.  So if you really want to go all out and get a toothbrush that does everything for you, this is it.  This thing does it all, tells you how long to brush, how hard you should brush, where and when you should brush ... wow - who ever thought brushing could be so complicated?  So, that&#x27;s it - this is a toothbrush of the highest quality with the most features.  If that turns you on, this will make you happy.  If you just want an electric toothbrush, there are cheaper models that get the job done.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using an Oral B/Braun electric toothbrush like this for about ten years, and and was on my second one before I had the chance to try this one out.  These brushes are great quality; they last forever, and do a nice job of keeping your teeth and gums healthy. In all the years that I&#x27;ve had my Oral B brushes, my dentists have always said that my teeth look good, and I&#x27;ve had very few cavities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This new iteration of the Oral B/Braun toothbrush includes the Smart Guide, which is supposed to guide you in terms of the amount of time, kind of brushing, etc. that you are using while brushing.  In theory, it sounds great, but the little display unit seems like overkill for adult brushes.  I don&#x27;t really need a smiley face that lights up when I complete a quadrant of my mouth, but I think that a children&#x27;s version of this would be great; it would keep kids motivated to brush for a full two minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Smart Guide itself was pretty easy to program, and it syncs up with the actual brush to display the amount of pressure you&#x27;re using, the mode (regular brushing, deep cleaning, etc.), and the number of seconds you&#x27;re spending on each of the four quadrants of your mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The travel case this comes with is a nice feature, and the docking/charging station also takes up a small footprint, which is nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know that this brush is of high quality and that it will last a long time, but if you don&#x27;t need all the extra features, a lower-priced model will probably suit your needs just as well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Oral-B electric toothbrushes for many years. This is the third version, purchased it primarily for travel so I could have one on the road - It&#x27;s become the main unit and I travel with the older one. Teeth feel clean and my dental hygienist even commented on how clean my teeth were on the last visit.</li>
            <li> This product really get you teeth clean and gets your gums into tip top shape. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Wonderful cleaning as intended.</li>
            <li> First power brush I have ever owned. Once you use it you realize you can not do as good a job by manual brushing. Bought this brand as it was recommended by dentist.  Hubby has become a convert as well.&lt;br /&gt;Seems well made and has different brush heads you can use.  Also like that it comes with a travel case.</li>
            <li> It takes the toothbrush a long time to charge, and it does not stay charged many days. Overall, a good toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Good toothbrush, round head reaches space along gums, and between teeth. I wish that model still included a screen on the handle, for viewing mode, charge, etc. Also, charging stand takes up a lot of room on counter. I don&#x27;t like that the separate screen requires double-sided tape to stick to the mirror. I would have preferred a suction cup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, it is a good toothbrush, but not much better (and in some ways, worse) than previous models.</li>
            <li> I ordered this toothbrush because my gums were beginning to recede due to too hard brushing. I bought the product mainly for the pressure sensor but I really love all of the features. It has a strong motor, and feels great on my teeth. I really like the little clock with the smiley face who frowns at me when i brush too hard and winks when I do a great job! Silly but it helps me brush better and longer. LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always wanted an aggressive, efficient and sensitive electric toothbrush. This is it, and I don&#x27;t have to put up with a quickly worn out brushhead. At last I feel as though I am having fun while I am thoroughly cleaning my teeth and at the same time flossing the tartar in between them!</li>
            <li> Having never owned this type of toothbrush, I was very impressed. I drink tea a lot and never could get the stains off just by brushing, but with this product my teeth feel as if I just left the dentist office. I don&#x27;t use it every day cause I am affraid of losing the enamel on my teeth. But I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Effective at Oral Hygiene... some issues around maintenance and durability&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Oral-B works to keep my teeth clean.  I can both feel the bristle action when brushing, and my periodic appointments with the hygienist have gone well (better than before the Oral-B).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two nits&lt;br /&gt; - After one year the \\&quot;you&#x27;re brushing too hard\\&quot; pressure sensor has broken, and stays permanently on.  This does not prevent us from using the brush, but it is a loss of functionality&lt;br /&gt; - Keeping the base clean is a challenge.  WE have hard water and scaly deposits build up on the bottom of the handle and on the base.  If we do not keep a paper towel under the base, it gets pretty messy there too.</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush.  Second one I have owned.  The timer is cute, not necessary, but cute.  It is the toothbrush that is the best.</li>
            <li> I like the toothbrush, and the brushes that I received as well.  I think the battery charging system takes way too long.  It takes more than 24 hours to recharge fully.  I do like the clock timer and the lights when you are pressing too hard.  A very good tooth brush except for the charging.</li>
            <li> Good Product I would buy it again. It does the job well. I  have no more to say. Don&#x27;t push me</li>
            <li> It was a gift for my son---and it is defective!  Doesn&#x27;t work!  We have to send it back! We haven&#x27;t gotten it back from our son, yet!</li>
            <li> Easy to use and operate.  Only disappointment was it came with only one toothbrush, so if sharing, buy another brush head.</li>
            <li> Though I floss daily and brush twice a day I get a lot of plaque build-up. I sprung for this electric toothbrush and it is well worth the money. My teeth feel quite incredibly clean after using it, and during my last dentist visit they remarked that I had a lot less plaque than usual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush has a warning light if you push too hard on your teeth, which is useful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also has a wireless &#x27;monitor&#x27;, which times your brushing and also displays a warning whenever you push too hard.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent toothbrush!  It gets my teeth extremely clean.  I thought the little remote unit would be a trashable novelty. But darn it if the competition of getting four stars and a smiley face, don&#x27;t ensure that I push through a complete two-minute brushing each and every time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do enjoy the deep cleaning mode that this model has as well..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The battery charge has been lasting about 8 days on 16x per week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has been in use for a few months now and I have no discolorations on the handle at all.</li>
            <li> This is a professional tooth brush. After using this tooth brush it feels as though I just got a cleaning at the dentist. My wife and I couldn&#x27;t be happier with this purchase!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with this toothbrush.  I like the different settings it can do and Oral B is a trusted name.  I have been using this toothbrush for months now and I have nothing but praise for it.  I find it gives me a nice clean feel and the included timer/clock is a great addition.  When it&#x27;s not telling you which quadrant to brush and how long you been brushing, it doubles as an unobtrusive clock.  The floss action does not replace the need to floss so you still need to floss along with brushing.  I use it daily, as does my wife.  We don&#x27;t have any cavities, and you can use any tooth paste you want with it.  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I had considered buying an electric toothbrush for quite a while but didn&#x27;t until I saw this one on the Dr. Oz show and read different reviews on Amazon.  I love using it and feel my teeth and gums are  much cleaner.  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have been using Oral-B orbital toothbrushes from 2002 to now.  Needed to place me older model do to the fact it died(not bad for 11 years of uses).  This Oral-B brush system has a lot of great feature that will make your teeth look and feel healthier.  You have little digital clock/indicator (the brush and clock connected by wireless radio signal) show you what type of cleaning settings your using.  To select a setting turn on the brush and press the arrow button then done.  In this kit you get one free brush head(it&#x27;s the flossing one) but I would order an extra brush kit with this.  Now, the brushing system the Oral-B uses is great.  Basically, your teeth are separated into four quadrants.  Once you are finished with one the next quadrants is lite-up on the indicator and the brush vibrates/pulses.  After each brushing session the indicator will give a rating out of five stars( 5 being the best) on how well you are brushing your teeth.  There is even a pressure senor to tell when you are applying to much pressure while you are brushing(also little bright red flash around the where the brush head connects with the power handle.  This is a great product to use for keeping your teeth clean and will reduce the time for the annual dentist cleaning.  Once you have tried this brush you will never want to brush your teeth the manual way again.</li>
            <li> Works great but a little awkward, probably will get use to it!! A very useful item and performs great cleaning!!</li>
            <li> I never used an electric toothbrush so I did my research and considered the pressure sensor and \\&quot;Smart Sense\\&quot; without these features I&#x27;d be brushing my teeth incorrectly with a very powerful brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this electric toothbrush if you&#x27;ve never used one. Otherwise buy one with less features and no \\&quot;Smart Sense\\&quot; technology to make you aware of your brushing habits.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;re not going to find an electric toothbrush better than Oral-B. The 5000 and 4000 (I have both) are the same for cleaning action. Both are great. The 5000 has a separate monitoring device that encourages you to do a thorough job. Use these brushes and rinse with Listerine and you shouldn&#x27;t have any gum or cavity problems.</li>
            <li> My wife and myself use this daily and are very pleased with its performance.  We have bought additional brushes for the other functions and they all work very well.  After using this my mouth always feels refreshed.  Much better than the battery operated toothbrushed.</li>
            <li> Very impressed with this brush.  I don&#x27;t understand anyone who finds it difficult to operate/figure out.  Very self explanatory.  I would highly recommend this to everyone.  Toss out your old electric and manual brushes.  You&#x27;ll be glad you did!</li>
            <li> So far, I really like this over my Sonic, plus my dentist says this is the best, so I got one.</li>
            <li> Works really good but still prefer the Sonic a bit better (more because of the brushes)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my second Oral-B 5000 Toothbrush. First one was amazing, I&#x27;ve traveled with it a lot and just after 3 years of everyday usage it stop keep charge. So I&#x27;ve bought new one. New one has some improvements (it&#x27;s lighter and pressure-warning red-light has much more convenient place now) and just one issue. It cannot be used during my travels. It&#x27;s 110-volts only, not 110-230 as it was with previous one. Since I travel a lot, this toothbrush is settled in my home now and I&#x27;ve been forced to buy another one for travelling purpose.</li>
            <li> Bought this as a gift, she loves it</li>
            <li> I like the toothbrush as it has done a good job cleaning my familes teeth.  The extra screen is a nice little gimmick to let you know how much time you have brushed your teeth.  It does a good job to get my children to brush their teeth for at least 2 minutes.  I wish Oral B would have put the setting you are using for your toothbrush also on the toothbrush itself somewhere instead of making you look at the screen.&lt;br /&gt;The only two complaints that I have about this purchase is that it did only come with one toothbrush, but I found other multi-pack brushes on Amazon for a good price.  The other complaint is that it seems like it takes the toothbrush a considerable amount of time to recharge and the battery does not seem to last for more than about 10-12 brushes before it needs to be recharged.</li>
            <li> Compared to the one I just replaced this one feels way more rough on my teeth and gums.  I tried to hold out the full two minutes to brush, but it just became too uncomfortable and a little painful.  I even tried to adjust the strength as it brushed and I could hardly tell a difference in the levels the brush has.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m still trying to give it a chance, but as of right now I&#x27;m not real thrilled with the purchase.  I miss my old brush!</li>
            <li> This spin brush is great, solidly built with additional features. It even lets you know if you&#x27;re applying too much pressure. I wish I&#x27;d purchased this years ago.</li>
            <li> My other Braun toothbrush battery died so I went on the hunt for a new one.  This one was recommended by the OralB website.  I absolutely adore it.  I was forced to use a manual toothbrush till this one came in the mail and my teeth felt dirty even though I just had a dental cleaning!!  I have sensitive teeth and this does not bother them one bit .  Also OralB has sensitive heads if I need them which I haven&#x27;t so far.  Also i&#x27;ve learned to prolong the battery life of your OralB toothbrush&gt;&gt; DO NOT hang it on the recharger everytime you are finished brushing your teeth.  Instead wait till the battery runs out and then recharge it.  Much like your cell phone.</li>
            <li> With this product you will definitely get what you pay for because it is ultra superior to manual brushing. It will have your teeth glistening like pearls. You will be hooked from the start and with five different cleaning modes; daily ( recommended two-minute cleaning: 30 seconds per quadrum ), deep ( three minutes: 45 seconds per quadrum), sensitive, polishing and message,along with a variety of brush heads there is a sweet spot for just about everyone. With the smart guild clock-timer it&#x27;ll even warns you if you are applying to much pressure. Given the proper name: &amp;#34;Precision&amp;#34; you will not over-due or under-due dental hygiene. Highly Recommended!</li>
            <li> This unit is suprisingly powerful.  I hadn&#x27;t purchased such a top of the line electric toothbrush before and didn&#x27;t realize how much better they are compared to the cheapie drugstore models.  I wish my weedwhacker had that much power.  This gets my teeth so clean I only have to brush every three or four days now! (Just kidding.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The digit timer is also a very convenient bathroom clock as well.</li>
            <li> I love the Oral-B Precision 5000. It does everything they say it does.  My teeth and gums feel healthy clean as if I just came from my dentist&#x27;s office after a professional cleaning.  I am recommending it to all my friends.  I love it !!!</li>
            <li> This is a great toothbrush.  I like the timer, much easier to get to the 2 minute mark, especially for people like me that have too much to do.  This is a great product and IMO worth the extra money.</li>
            <li> This classic Braun Oral-B is second to none...the management system functions are a bit over the top, but if one needed that level of guidance, I guess it better be there?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The charge once and use for a week part is awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hope is this one is at least half as reliable as it predecessor!  10 years+ of loyal service!!!</li>
            <li> I have bought Oral-B toothbrushes several times in the past. Each lasted a long time and I was very happy with it. But this Oral-B PC 5000 is a real bummer. I had a short life and had problems properly charging. It was not equipped for serving in both European and American voltages except by adding an expensive add on device. And it quickly failed.&lt;br /&gt;You would think P &amp; G would do a better job. P &amp; G was once one of the great iconic American brands and now this malfunctioning model has replaced older much better models.&lt;br /&gt;Buy a different brand.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;I like it, I love it, I want some more of it&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt; Tim M.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &amp;#34;I like it, I love it, I want some more of it&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt; Tim M.</li>
            <li> Makes your teeth feel so clean. I would recommend this toothbrush to anyone. I might even up my rating once I have my next cleaning.</li>
            <li> I had a sonic care toothbrush for years! It lasted forever. When it finally did die I got onto Amazon and looked up the current version Sonic care and looked to see what else was out there now. I like what I saw and read about this Oral B toothbrush. It makes my teeth feel so so clean. I love it! There are so many things that are better than my last one (of course that one was quite old)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t played with the settings much, I have been stuck on the floss setting.</li>
            <li> Oral-B makes the best electronic toothbrushes on the market.  I have been using another brand for 4 years, and it basically just vibrated.  When it&#x27;s life ran its course, I ran back to Oral-B.  This models is especially fun because of the clock.  It not only indicates the time, but it also keeps track of the time you spend brushing.  You can set different settings (times), but regardless of the one chosen, you can always see exactly how much time you actually brushed.  The setting is also broken up in segments so that as you reach each quarter of the time set, there is a pause and a slight beeping.  The number of beeps lets you know where you are in the cycle, so you can walk around your entire house and keep up with the time.  And, when you are not brushing, there&#x27;s the clock.</li>
            <li> This my favorite tool. I Use it 4 or 5 times a day.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t find it user friendly and I am truly not happy with the product. For the price I am surely disappointed in the OralB</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always owned Sonic Care toothbrushes in the past, but decided to buy Oral B this time - like it MUCH better!</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended this unit for me. I have never used an electric toothbrush before. I like the brush, but the directions sent with them we horrible.  Nothing in writing, just pictures to describe how to set up and use. Not great. I&#x27;m still not sure I&#x27;m using it correctly</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this product for about 2 months now and so far it&#x27;s worked great!  I thought the extra screen with the timer/clock on it was a bit much when I first opened the package, but I can now honestly say it comes in handy while brushing.  My teeth feel just as clean as when I go to the dentist!</li>
            <li> Switched back from Sonicare to Oral B as I find the small round toothbrushes better remove plaque for me.  (Also, the Sonicare seemed to fling more dental detritus onto the bathroom mirror which was kind of gross.) Given this decision, thought I would go with just about the best Oral B on Amazon.  What a waste of money.  This thing has two insurmountable design flaws.  First, the battery is terrible.  I get maybe 3 to 4 full 2+ minute brushings before the power is very low and the brush action is dramatically weaker.  Would never, ever use this as a travel toothbrush. They must have used a battery recycled from an early 90s Motorola Micro TAC cell phone for this thing.  Second, there are like 87 different brushing modes - polish, gentle, whitening, normal, scrotum scrub, etc.  It sounds great to have all these options, but from the toothbrush itself it is impossible to know what mode you are in.  Oh, OK, I&#x27;ll just pull out that instruction manual I have in my wallet or the other one I have mounted to the bathroom wall.  I mean, come one, who keeps a toothbrush instruction manual within easy reach???  Horribly disappointed as a I previously had great experiences with Braun products and considered Braun to have a great reputation for quality products and design.  But it gets two stars because even if you do not know what mode you are in, it seems to clean teeth if you always leave it on the charging base when not in use.</li>
            <li> I like this Oral-B toothbrush.  Time will tell whether I love it or not.  As with past Oral B toothbrushes, I am concerned about the longevity of the battery.  In the past, I have only had two years of performance from the batteries in Oral-B toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for 4-5 months now.. the timer is nice, as it serves as a clock as well as the guide for how long you should be brushing..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you brush too hard, a red light flashes on both the toothbrush and the display..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one minor flaw is that mildew builds up inside of the brush heads quite easily.. you can reduce this by taking the brush head off after every use, rinsing it out then shaking it dry.. but to completely eliminate the mildew, I wash out the brush heads in hydrogen peroxide every couple of weeks which seems to work well.  I had a different brand of electric toothbrush prior to this which did not have this issue due to a different brush head design.  Not a deal-breaker, but something to know...</li>
            <li> I bought this toothbrush for my family , they are so pleased with it .. your mouth feels like you&#x27;ve been to the dentist everyday ...</li>
            <li> Great teeth cleaning. Not sure how it will work for people with smaller mouths. Seems large in the back of mine and I&#x27;m told I have a big mouth! I also wish there was more info on children and electric toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> Magnificent, met all our needs and expectations. One of our best purchases, providing excellant oral care .Considering additional puchases for other family members.</li>
            <li> This is my second one. Works as described, and no cavities!! yes no cavities for this 40 year old. I love it!!</li>
            <li> Very solid feeling. Hope the battery lasts. You get a very clean feel. This replaced my other oral b which lasted 12 years</li>
            <li> Always used oral b products, and, highly recommend this newest electric toothbrush. Wonderful product worth every penny, like the 5 speeds.</li>
            <li> While I am a fan of the toothbrush, Oral B as a company has terrible support.  When my brush broken after a month it took nearly 3 months and constant follow ups to get my brush back. And now when my bracket for the smart guide broke and I called to try to purchase another one, they said they do not sell them?!!?! How can a company not sell a replacement part?!</li>
            <li> Great product!  This is the 3rd (and best) Oral-B I&#x27;ve used over the years.  Their products just keep getting better!</li>
            <li> The unit works as advertised. Overall, a really good tooth brush and the battery life is very good. I typically go 1-week in between charges. I do not leave the unit on the charger every day. It took 1-2 weeks to get used to the floss action of the brush head. Initially, my gums were sore. However, the sensitivity went away after a week of use.</li>
            <li> It works as advertised.  I love the ease of use and the multi brushing levels.  I will purchase this Oral-B for the entire family.</li>
            <li> The adjunct display would seem to be superfluous at first, but it does focus one&#x27;s attention on thoroughly finishing each quadrant before moving on to the next.  The brush cleans those hard-to-reach areas quite well.  I&#x27;m very happy with this product as long as it lasts long enough to justify the price.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my daughter and she loves it.  I can&#x27;t say anything else about this because I am not the owner.</li>
            <li> I am really impressed with this Oral-B Pro 5000 toothbrush. I can hardly wait for my next dental appointment. The hygienist recommended I switch to a spinning-type brush. I first tried a cheap, generic brand one and it was very hard on my gums. This one also has a red light to warn when brushing too hard. I also like the timer. It is built-in that it pauses every 30 secs. But it also has a wall mountable timer/clock. Finally the travel option is wonderful. The travel case fit nicely in my carry-on suitcase holding 2 brush heads and the base. The charge held for 8 days used twice a day, never slowed down. I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Easy to use. Needed it very badly due to a recent broken arm that limited my strength for brushing teeth. This was perfect solution</li>
            <li> Have used Braun/Oral B electric toothbrushes for years. Have used the 5000 for a month and find the cleaning action is more robust than ever without irritating my gums. Some stains have disappeared that even the dentist didn&#x27;t remove and earlier models hadn&#x27;t removed either. My teeth appear whiter and just feel cleaner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I purchased the unit, I didn&#x27;t think the Smartguide would be of benefit, but find I refer to it often. I have had the opportunity to use the travel kit and like the design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At this point I think the 5000 is well worth the price and am glad I bought it.</li>
            <li> So this is hands down the best toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever owned. I&#x27;ve always been the kind of person that only brushed his teeth to escape the incriminating stares of his dentist. I never miss a brushing now, because I look forward to brushing my teeth! If you don&#x27;t want your entire world to be turned upside down, don&#x27;t purchase this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Everything.&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Kinda a long charging time. Probably better for the battery though. Also, I turned into a toothbrush nerd.</li>
            <li> Never tried this before, got this after some research between braun and philips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just used twice and i could already see the difference... i think this will help keep my oral hygiene and health, good in the long term.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are multiple options, the wireless smart guide is cool, works as a small time piece as well in the bathroom and shows the current mode and amount of time to brush each quadrant, not a necessary piece but a useful gadget to have.</li>
            <li> The Oral B Precision 5000 is an excellent toothbrush. I like the feature that lets you know when you&#x27;ve completed brushing each quadrant.</li>
            <li> This has been an excellent purchase for my husband and me. My husband used to use too much pressure while brushing; this toothbrush alerts him as well as adjusts when he&#x27;s overdoing it. I love the different brush heads that allow me access to difficult to reach areas and to &amp;#34;polish&amp;#34;, just like the dentist does after a cleaning. If you&#x27;ve had oral care issues in the past, this is the brush for you.</li>
            <li> As a long time Sonicare user I was reluctant to believe that anything was better than the Sonicare. Given my dental condition, when my Sonicare started to die, I knew it was time for moving brush-head technology. After some research, I found the Oral-B 5000 and couldn&#x27;t be happier with it. I&#x27;ve noticed my teeth are far cleaner, and my whole mouth seems to be in better health. The timer doubles as a handy bathroom clock. Battery life is terrific (recently went 6 days without a charge while traveling without issue). Finally, the unit is well weighted, ergonomically functional, and has a more pleasant noise than the Sonicare.</li>
            <li> I bought this on the recommendation of my dental tech after my other Oral-B toothbrush died.  This device has the same circular motion that is on the equipment in the dentist&#x27;s office and does seem to do a better job of getting some food particles out from between teeth (not that good so flossing still necessary!).  Battery lasts a good 2 weeks; has same problem as previous version in that recharging takes more than 12 hours. Also comes with travel case which works well and a little timer/pressure monitor/clock which probably isn&#x27;t necessary.  I have gotten pretty good at counting the 30 second intervals and if you over-pressure the brush a red light pops on on the brush (as well as the little monitor).  All in all a good product I believe--as long as you use it!</li>
            <li> Item as described. Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> Trips to the dentist seem to prove its worth, but I wish the battery was consumer replaceable. This is my second version and it&#x27;s changed very little. The chsrging base being the biggest change. A charge will last several days.</li>
            <li> Awesome little toothbrush that has definitely improved my oral health. The brush arrived to my apartment quickly and setup was super easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The timer seems a little lame at first with the smiley face and countdown, but it keeps you on check with your brushing and I find myself paying more attention to my gums, my mucosa, and tongue in my daily routine. It&#x27;s pretty fun to use and I&#x27;ll never go back to a manual. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I already got one of these through my dentist office and I love mine. So I got this one as a present for my husband. I was able to buy it for 40.00 less then I paid for mine through my dental office!  It works great and CVS carries replacement heads when needed.</li>
            <li> I almost purchased the new top of the line Sonicare but after doing some comparison shopping I decided on the Oral B 5000.  The Oral B is significantly less expensive and has a greater variety of replacement brush heads which are also less expensive.  The Oral B 5000 does a great job cleaning, whitening and polishing my teeth.  It&#x27;s not quite dentist&#x27;s office clean but pretty close.  I have a couple of chronic pin point stains in my lower incisors which my dental hygienist never completely gets out.  They have started to disappear after about a month using the Oral B.  As far as the smart guide, I concur with some of the other reviewers.  It&#x27;s gimmicky and unnecessary.  If you are making the transition from a manual and/or less powerful battery operated brush you may want to consider purchasing some of the sensitive replacement heads to start with.  They are more manageable in the mouth and are a lot easier on the gums.  The floss action head contains 4 plastic prongs that are loosely attached so they have a great deal of movement when the head rotates.  The prongs do a good job of removing food particles between the teeth but take some getting used to.  So far I am thoroughly satisfied with the performance of this product.  Looking forward to a great check up in a few months.</li>
            <li> I replaced a Dell printer with this one.  It is so lovely having a printer do what it should do without coaxing.  My opinion will be more useful after I print off a couple of reams of paper.  So far, whew!  A great change.</li>
            <li> Most of my life I&#x27;ve used a manual toothbrush but about 2 years ago I switched to one of those inexpensive electric toothbrushes that are sold right alongside the manual ones in the store (they usually cost around $10).  As soon as I switched I was hooked and could tell a difference.  When I went to my dentist last year they said my teeth looked \\&quot;ok\\&quot; but recommended I upgrade to a more expensive toothbrush and recommended one of the rechargeable Oral-b models (I can&#x27;t remember which one).  Well, I decided to stick with my regular cheapy brush until recently.  I went to the store to get a replacement &amp; they were actually out of the ones I usually get and the cheapest electric model they had was a $35 Oral-b model.  I decoded to go ahead &amp; get it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I used it I couldn&#x27;t believe the difference it made and I used it about a week before I did a little online research &amp; decided to upgrade to the 5000 model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was hesitant to spend $110 on a toothbrush but the first time I used it I could tell a huge difference.  It honestly feels like I&#x27;ve been to the dentist each time I brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Wireless SmartGuide thingy is a little difficult to get set up (at least it was for me), but having the timer &amp; being able to see how long I need to spend in each area is great.  The replacement brushes are a little expensive but they&#x27;re supposed to last about 3 months each so I don&#x27;t mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re sitting on the fence &amp; can&#x27;t decide whether to get one of these, just go ahead &amp; splurge.  Your teeth will thank you for it!</li>
            <li> This takes getting used to if you have used a toothbrush your whole life.  You can&#x27;t keep your lips tightly closed over the unit so you have to keep a Kleenex handy to catch the drips. Some folks may not have a problem with it.</li>
            <li> This is a long life review of the oralb 3735. I bought this tooth brush roughly 5 years ago because i smoke and stains come with the territory. When I bought it I was in the military and it has survived longer then my combat boots. It has been through Iraq, Afghanistan, Kyrgyzstan, Ireland, Kuwait, Germany, Dominican Republic, and across the USA with absolutely no problems. It has held a charge during missions lasting 2 weeks and has never let me down. If it seems like I&#x27;m a bit over appreciative consider that when you go almost a month without being able to take a shower yet your teeth feel amazingly clean it brings you a little bit closer to home.... and every bit counts. Its still going strong.</li>
            <li> it works great and it was available at a great price.&lt;br /&gt;it is easy to operate and understand.&lt;br /&gt;thank you</li>
            <li> it was massive improvment after using a regular toothbrush .&lt;br /&gt;my teeth feel so clean and smooth .&lt;br /&gt;i don&#x27;t understand how the monitor (smart guide) work . i was looking so much time for guide for this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;great product&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i&#x27;ll update later .</li>
            <li> Its a good toothbrush very powerful than my old OralB. worked well but i dont like the charging adapter and charging base</li>
            <li> Every time I brush my teeth with this I feel like when I just leave the dentist (minus the bleeding gums). The clock/timer thing is really handy because I can guarantee you don&#x27;t brush for a full two minutes. Tooth brushing minutes make microwave minutes seem like a flash.</li>
            <li> I have used Oral B for 15 years since abandoning my regular toothbrush . it&#x27;s amazing This new model is very efficient. The timing reminder helps greatly.</li>
            <li> This was a replacement item and I continue to be quite happy with the performance. I would recommend this item to anyone who is in the market for this type of item.</li>
            <li> Incredible, my teeth have never looked better. will have to see what the dentist says here in 6 months.  Extremely happy with the product and of course Amazon and their amazing customer service.</li>
            <li> Oral-B Professional Healthy Clean + Floss Action Precision 5000 Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased a Precision 5000 earlier in the year, and this Precision 5000 is quite different. First, the packaging has been improved - it is now similar to Amazon&#x27;s Frustration-Free packaging and most likely better for the environment due to less plastics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The new Precision 5000 has an updated SmartGuide that uses stars to indicate which quadrant you&#x27;re brushing (or supposed to be brushing) along with a smiley face that is always on with the clock. The Precision 5000 itself has a new look. It uses LEDs to indicate state of charge instead of a LCD display. The texture of the grip is different, and the body and buttons are more ergonomic to use. The charging base and base of the 5000 is different -it now resembles the traditional Oral B base where the charger has a nub that clips into a recess on the toothbrush. The 5000 I purchased earlier in the year was also inductive, but the entire base of the brush just sits into a ring to charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The new 5000 also uses an audible beep every 30 seconds along with Oral B&#x27;s traditional pause. However, for each 30 second interval, there is an extra beep. So at the end of a 2 minute brushing session, there will be 4 consecutive beeps which can get annoying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush head interface remains the same, so the existing inventory of brush heads will work on this model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s still no way to set it to default to sensitive mode. Oral B now requires you to do an extra press of the mode button to get into the sensitive/feather mode (2 total) versus 1 with the older 5000.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall: 5/5 stars, still the same great Precision 5000 but with some minor tweaks. I wouldn&#x27;t call it revolutionary or evolutionary, it&#x27;s just different from the earlier 5000. The SmartGuide seems unnecessary, as are the pauses and beeps every 30 seconds.</li>
            <li> This is a user friendly electric toothbrush that is helpful to people, like myself, who don&#x27;t brush their teeth as long as they should. I like the five brushing modes that are available and I also like smart guide to that helps me keep brushing a full two minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The toothbrush and smart guide are easy to assemble. The guide book has easy to read text and good diagrams that make it easy to assemble, use and clean the toothbrush and smart guide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The toothbrush comes with five cleaning modes which are daily clean, deep clean, sensitive clean, whitening and massage. I have used them all and use them all regularly except for the deep cleaning mode which is basically an extended daily clean mode. I do notice a difference between modes, especially the massage mode.  All the modes feel comfortable to use.  The massage mode causes my gums to tingle a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I especially like the smart guide. It is great for children as well as lazy adults such as myself.  The smart guide is a battery operated clock that has a smiley face on it with a circle around it and stars on the bottom of the screen.  The moment the toothbrush is turned on an icon on the smart guide shows which cleaning mode is currently being used. As you change modes by pressing a button on the toothbrush the smart guide shows an icon representing the mode; for instance a feather represents the sensitive mode and a diamond the whitening mode.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once you turn on the toothbrush the clock on the smart guide disappears and a timer starts listing the time you use the toothbrush. The instruction book explains that you should brush one quadrant of your mouth at a time. As 30 seconds are up (45 in the deep cleaning mode) a quarter of the circle around the smiling face is filled in letting the user know it is time to  move to the next quadrant. The toothbrush also beeps and stops for a second. One of the stars on the smartguide is then filled in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t like to brush my teeth and two minutes can seem like an eternity when I am rushing to get to work or when I am tired at the end of the night.  The smart guide helps me  brush for the recommended amount of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The toothbrush is easy to clean and  the base does not take up much space.  The toothbrush is kept in the base so it is always charged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is an easy to use toothbrush that helps me keep brushing for the correct amount of time. All the modes feel good to use.</li>
            <li> I am a long-time user of Oral B electric toothbrushes and have tried several other brands as well. I think Oral B products do the best job. This brush has all the \\&quot;bells and whistles.\\&quot; I think the Smart Guide is a handy reminder to assist you in spending the correct amount of time on each quadrant of your mouth. The \\&quot;smiley face and stars\\&quot; system may also be helpful in getting children to brush longer. A red LED lights up on the handle if you are using improper technique. The product is well-made as usual per Oral B... a 60-day money back guarantee and 2-Year limited warranty for replacement or repair of product is included. Look for rebates and coupons to keep the costs of Oral B products down. I rarely pay full price for anything they sell. There were no bad \\&quot;surprises\\&quot; with this item... just the same quality I&#x27;ve come to expect with Oral B products... and the Smart Guide can actually be helpful in giving feedback to encourage proper brushing. 5 stars! :)</li>
            <li> Excellent product, exactly as described on Amazon&#x27;s webpage. After using the brush several times, I&#x27;m ordering another one for a family member.</li>
            <li> Awesome toothbrush, cleans so much better than a manual. Also my teeth seem to be whiter than before. Would definetly recommend.</li>
            <li> This brush is powerful and fun to brush with.&lt;br /&gt;It is amazingly effective. It leaves your teeth feeling wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;I would give 5 stars, but the little timer thing it comes with is useless.</li>
            <li> It was recommended to us by our dentist.  We purchased it for our own use and find it very satisfactory</li>
            <li> New handle feels better than previous model.  The timer is a smart innovation to help maintain a consistent standard of brushing.  The clock on timer gadget is a convenient add-on for the bath room (saves having to walk out to bedroom or lounge to check time).  The wireless connection between the toothbrush and timer is handy.</li>
            <li> It just works as described, but it needs to be recharged at least every 2 days (reason of not letting 5 stars) to keep it working at full speed all the time.  Great product, I think I will never come back to manual brushing. : )!!!!</li>
            <li> This is a great toothbrush--timer makes me brush full two minutes and my mouth feels clean and fresh. Also it is easy to take with me when traveling.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m replacing one of the original 2 speed brushes. I thought I&#x27;d replace it with a higher end model.  Mistake!  I always use the sensitive mode.  The nice thing about the 3000 (I&#x27;ve now discovered) is that, even though it has 3 modes, you get to sensitive mode second. Instead of pressing the power button twice, you press the power button once and the mode change button once. The 5000 had *5* modes.  To get to sensitive mode, you press the power button once and the mode change button twice. Once Oral B started introducing more than two modes, it should have though about simplifying access to any particular mode, such as being able to change the default.  For example, have the brush start up in the mode that was last used until the mode change button is pressed again.</li>
            <li> this product worth any penny  ,it works great and its highly quality toothbrush, i had the triumph before and it works 4 years</li>
            <li> I am disappointed in the latest model of the Oral-B toothbrush.  The hole in the base to accommodate the charger is deeper and the toothbrush leaves toothpaste rings no matter how well it is rinsed.  This now requires constant cleaning and was not a problem with the  earlier model I had.</li>
            <li> After some stern lectures from my dentist and hygienist that I have to pay more attention to my brushing, I decided to do some research on the best toothbrush I can get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really needed to step up my game in the toothbrush department so I decided that an electric toothbrush was the way to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Oral-B Precision 5000 won me over in the ratings as well as actual daily use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About 2 years ago I got Invisalign braces which required me to floss and brush my teeth after every meal and drink (except water) before reinserting them back into my mouth.  My Precision 5000 is my new best friend.  It cleans extremely welll and fast.  I was pretty upset I did not make the move to electric toothbrushes sooner!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not use the smartguide that came with the toothbrush because I really don&#x27;t need it and I can&#x27;t figure it out.  That is really a minor issue.  Since I travel for work all the time, the small charging base and cord for the toothbrush and the included travel case has been a lifesaver.  I&#x27;m constantly using the toothbrush throughout the day but the battery remains useful for about 4-5 days before I need to put it on the charger.  It loses some of it&#x27;s brushing power the longer you use it without a recharge, but it is minor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To sum it up:  I love this product.  It works extremely well, looks great in my bathroom, and is pretty portable.  I&#x27;d say get one today.  Your teeth will thank you!</li>
            <li> I love a toothbrush that does ALL the work for me.  In the morning when I don&#x27;t feel like paying attention this little bad boy alerts when its time to change sections of my mouth.  I am able to just stand in the shower and wake up while my mouth becomes minty fresh.  I have used all of the different brush heads and all of the settings and I would never imagined myself bragging about a toothbrush to other people, but I do!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My dentist also loves a toothbrush that does ALL the work for me.  He has never seen my teeth so clean.  My 6-month cleanings and checkups are a complete joke now, I sit in the chair and ask him why I even bother to do these routine visits any more.  His answer is because his children need to go to college.  Lucky for him I am a big supported of education.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased the Oral-B Precision 5000 to replace an older model Oral-B electric toothbrush. I highly recommend this product. In the past with the older product I sometimes didn&#x27;t always brush for the recommended two minutes. With the 5000 I now have no problem brushing 2 minutes and most times I brush an extra minute. My teeth and gums feel cleaner and healthier. I am totally satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good caliber toothbrush, but a cheaper build than the previous model.  This one takes 48 hours to charge where the other one would always charge overnight.  It will do until I dump it and try something besides Oral-B next time.  Saw a Sonicare at a dentist office the other day and when turned on sounded like a Ferrari compared to this brush.  It&#x27;s gotta cost more too I suspect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Customer service was very quick to resolve the original rebate issue I posted.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the first electrci one for me and I will keep buying. My wife and myself use every day and we like it. the accesory is good to see how long are you using the toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Excellent does everything as promised. It is a pleasure to use. The directions were great and easy to understand. Good product</li>
            <li> Love this model.  It replaced a much older Oral B cordless tooth brush.  It does such an awesome job at the very next dental checkup after using this model for about 6 weeks, the hygeniest commented on what a difference she saw in my teeth.  She barely had to do anything for her cleaning, was mostly just polishing.  All the many features make it a thorough tooth cleaning device.  Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Best toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever had.  I love the pressure sensor.  My teeth feel even more clean than when I use a manual toothbrush.</li>
            <li> My son wanted this as it was from a list of life&#x27;s little luxuries. Not something that many might ask for but he was thrilled. I researched it first with my friend who is a dentist...guess what? She uses it too! Sold and great gift! My son loves it!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t think it is everything Dental Assistant promised but it is better than the Other brand. I use it twice a day.</li>
            <li> It cleans well, it is easy to use, and holds enough charge to last several days.  My dentist recommends it.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t read the instructions  because I&#x27;ve been a Braun toothbrush user since 1990&#x27;s. I simply charged it up inserted the battery in the display unit and begin brushing my teeth. I was disappointed that the unit was totally out of sink in monitoring my tooth brushing. I called customer service for support. In only a few minutes, the agent directed me in setting the unit so it was in sink with the tooth brush. I was amazed and thankful for his guidence. I am very satisfied with the Braun 5000. It cleans great.</li>
            <li> After a lot of research I choose these brushes and was not at all disappointed. They make your&lt;br /&gt;mouth feel fresh and clean. No regular toothbrush can match that. I would recommend this product&lt;br /&gt;to anyone that want&#x27;s to care for their teeth and gums.</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended it.  Did research on several different models and this one seemed to fit my needs.  I had to take my time in learning the different modes it has.  Still learning, but very happy with the results so far.  The replacement brushes are expensive, but cheaper than bad teeth.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush does an excellent job helping me make sure i clean all of my teeth. It comes with a case that fits multiple heads, so up to 4 people can use the same handle. It is easy to tell when you have done a good job brushing as well as you get a star rating when you turn the toothbrush off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also the extra timer is excellent to have as a clock in the bathroom when you are not brushing your teeth.</li>
            <li> Best toothbush I have ever used, would highly recommend to all and I got it at a good price too!</li>
            <li> this is the first tool that we&#x27;ve found useful to get our son to properly brush his teeth.  He found the remote indicator helpful and entertaining.  Been in use for a few months, and so far so good.</li>
            <li> this is an awesome brush.  My teeth feel clean and after 5 days of use, I got the best dental report card every.  the only problem I&#x27;ve had is the timer, I cannot get it open to put the batteries in to use it.  the plastic is really hard and it wont open.</li>
            <li> Wow. This toothbrush is amazing. The motor has a whole lot of kick so, if you&#x27;ve been neglecting your teeth and gums (tsk, tsk), then I recommend putting it on a gentler setting than its defaults.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The remote display is a nice touch but I find it to be unnecessary for me. I suspect many people out there would benefit from it instructing them in how long they should brush each quadrant and the alert if one is brushing too hard.</li>
            <li> Previously owned an electric toothbrush and was a bit reluctant to try again.  This toothbrush is really good with multiple settings and we love the timer.</li>
            <li> I love this thing! Feels like I just had my teeth cleaned at the Dentist every day!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  My wife has had her Oral-B for several months now on the recomendation of our Dental Hygientist and when her next scheduled cleaning time came my wife could not beleive the difference. She was out of the chair in 20 minutes. The Hygientist was already done!  I didn&#x27;t think I would ever use something like this. I Thought these things were a novalty and would be a pain in the rump. But after my wife&#x27;s progress, I decided to give one a try. Wife said I wasn&#x27;t touching hers, so I purchased my own.  I&#x27;m looking forward to seeing what reward I receive from our hygienist. Maybe I&#x27;ll get a \\&quot;See Ya in Six Months\\&quot; instead of three months. May get a lollipop too! Ya think? Probably not.&lt;br /&gt;  Love the timer too. Stuck it right to my mirror and it helps me to keep moving along so I&#x27;m not over cleaning or under cleaning. So, If you want to stay out of the dentists chair My wife and I Highly recommend an Oral-B</li>
            <li> We have an earlier version of this toothbrush and love the updates to the design.  Way easier to clean the holder now!</li>
            <li> so far so good. It leaves my teeth smooth and clean, not like ordinary toothbrush. I love the timer that shows me how long I need to brush my teeth for.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned a number of electric toothbrushes and the only two brands that are worth anything are Oral-B and Phillips.  There&#x27;s little difference between the results you get from both of their high-end products (the last independent test results I saw gave the Oral-b a slight edge but it didn&#x27;t include the latest brush from Phillips), so it really comes down to personal preference.  I ended up choosing the Oral-B 4000 (after trying the nearly identical 5000) and my wife prefers the Phillips Diamond Clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Phillips selling point is their excellent sonic technology, which based on my use does seem superior to the sonic \\&quot;pulses\\&quot; produced by the Oral-b.  However I&#x27;ve found that the addition of the spinning brush really puts the Oral-b over the top for me.  It just feels more effective.  My wife however hates how much it rattles her head when she uses it.  If you have a sensitive mouth or are prone to headaches, this probably isn&#x27;t for you.  However having used them both I do give the Oral-b the top marks for overall effectiveness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I mentioned I settled on the 4000 over the 5000.  They are pretty much identical.  The 5000 has a \\&quot;Deep Clean\\&quot; mode which really means \\&quot;Longer Brush Time\\&quot;.  It also has \\&quot;Wireless Smart Guide\\&quot; which just annoyed me.  I don&#x27;t really want some little device giving me smiley faces when I brush well.  If that appeals to you, then go for it.  Otherwise take a good look at the nearly identical Oral-b 4000 which, depending on the vagaries of Amazon pricing, can be much cheaper (when I bought mine it was $40 cheaper but today I see they are just $5 appart).</li>
            <li> Travel case&lt;br /&gt; Wireless SmartGuide&lt;br /&gt; Family toothbrush head holder&lt;br /&gt; Small footprint charging station&lt;br /&gt;everthing is ok.

            <li> As always Braun makes the best tooth brushes ever. This is my third toothbrush in 20 years. All of them lasted many years. The speed is just right, it displays the usage of the battery and slows down every 30 seconds to show how much time you are brushing your teeth. The clock also shows the brushing time. The only complain I have is when you reach 2 minutes it stops completely for about 1 or 2 seconds and then starts again. I would prefer if it just slowed down as it does every 30 seconds. Other then that I love it!</li>
            <li> I like the fact that is does a great job of removing tartar from teeth but even on sensitive mode and regular brush head it still is tough on my gums and sides of cheeks. Will keep trying to adjust to get past that issue.</li>
            <li> I love the product .My teeth feels as if I have been to the dentist. The best I have ever had.</li>
            <li> I bought this after a year of using the Philips Sonicare.  I just wanted to try something new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro: it does feel like the brush really works on a more isolated area of the teeth thoroughly&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con: Ergonomically, it was not made for small hands.  The Sonicare has a much slimmer design.  The brush on this Braun is about 1/3 thicker including the plastic head.  Right now this Braun is charging and is at 2/3 charged since 0700 hours til now 1840 hours.  So almost 12 hours and it is still at 2/3 the battery charged.  Maybe I got a defective one?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Summary: If you have a big hand, big mouth, and don&#x27;t mind waiting for it to fully charge (over 12 hours), then this is for you ;)  But for the price, i would just go get the Philips Sonicare.  It&#x27;s a different technology, but I am happy with it.  This model/package does NOT come with a dual voltage, 110v/220v, charger.  It&#x27;s only 110/130.  A dual voltage charger can be purchased through 3rd parties.</li>
            <li> Still adjusting to the intense cleaning action but overall very pleased with the function - I&#x27;ve owned several Oral-B toothbrushes but this is the best model I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> My dentist said I needed a power toothbrush, and she recommended three different types. This was one of them. One thing that surprised me was that it felt good on my gums. I have always used a manual toothbrush before. When I went back to the dentist, she said my gums looked healthier.&lt;br /&gt;So there you have it. Dentist approved and patient approved</li>
            <li> This is so easy to use and my teeth and gums feel great. Even though its effortless to put it back on the charge each time, sometimes I forget to.  But even if you forget, it still holds a charge for at least a day.</li>
            <li> I have been using an Oral-B electric toothbrush for the past four years and regret I did not switch over many years before. My teeth definitely feel cleaner after a two minute session. The SmartSeries 5000 is a step up from various Oral-B models I have used in the past. The basic speed for a daily clean seems to be the same. Oral-B uses standard heads and chargers throughout their product line so this makes all my old accessories compatible -- a good thing. A good manual (written in clear English) is included along with the brush and accessories (with the former... gasp... actually being made in Germany.) A two year warranty (good) and a 60 day money back guarantee are included.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This model comes with a charger, one head, a traveling case and a separate wireless smart guide unit. The cleaning modes for the brush are Daily Clean, Deep Clean, Sensitive, Whitening, and Massage. I am sure all these modes are fine, but 98 percent of the time I use \\&quot;Daily Clean.\\&quot; The SmartGuide takes some explaining. This is a small wireless device (comes with optional wall mount and 2 AA batteries) that is basically a timer for your brush cycles.  When you activate your toothbrush it sends a signal to the SmartGuide and shows how long you have been brushing your teeth and with the use of multiple icons how well you have been doing.  If you are using too much pressure, a red light appears on both the brush and the guide display -- I found that I was brushing hard way too often so this has been a helpful feature for me. Not sure if harder brushing actually hurts my oral health, but definitely makes the brush heads wear out faster. The SmartGuide works as a normal digital clock for your bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush automatically beeps (in the daily clean cycle) every 30 seconds to indicate when the recommended two minute brushing time is complete and the SmartGuide has a large quadrant icon showing the stages of brushing. I laughed when I saw the device and thought it was gimmicky, but now I am hooked and watch the screen. The toothbrush also has its own battery indicator (3 levels) -- most other models only indicate if the battery needs to be charged (like immediately!). I am getting about 10 days of use (2x/day&#x3D;20 brushings) as described -- though I expect that to diminish as the unit ages as rechargeable batteries aren&#x27;t good forever (and are NOT replaceable despite the fact they are removable.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A middle-of-the-road Oral-B toothbrush is probably fine for most folks, but if you catch this model on sale or with a rebate it should be a brush that your dentist is happy about you using. I find my replacement heads cheapest at the local warehouse store that starts with the letter C. My hygienist never complains about my teeth (in fact I have no cavities period) but gum issues do run in my family -- hopefully with a good oral health plan including this brush I won&#x27;t have to suffer the same fate as my parents.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this electric toothbrush with the caveat that it requires frequent head replacements.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Among electric toothbrushes, this is exceptionally powerful with fast rotation.  When the head is still new and fibers stiff and straight, the toothbrush does something special on teeth.  On the insides especially, it leaves a feeling against the tongue that&#x27;s smooth like just being to the dentist for a polishing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can pop the charger out of the tray unit.  I actually threw the tray unit away, not that I&#x27;m recommending doing that.  For me, the tray is not helpful, but it could be if more than one person uses the toothbrush so that everybody can fit their own head on it when they brush.</li>
            <li> So glad I bought the Oral B toothbrush.  It leaves my teeth feeling cleaner than a manual toothbrush has ever.  I love the different settings I am able to choose from and the timer helps me with brushing to the max time.  The storage case makes it easy to travel with as well.</li>
            <li> I got this model to replace the Oral-B/Braun \\&quot;Triumph Professional Care\\&quot; (now discontinued version) toothbrush that I&#x27;ve been using for about 6 years now and that I&#x27;ve been very happy with. While I loved that old model, my one complaint was that the battery didn&#x27;t hold a very sizable charge, and with age it just got worse -- at the time of my replacing it, it was only holding enough charge for about 2 brushings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enter the new Oral-B Smartseries 5000 Professional Care Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush.... At first glance, even down to the accessories, it looks nearly identical to the old model, barring an LED-based display on the brush-body rather than the LCD used previously, functions almost identically, and even takes the same heads. However, it&#x27;s a significant improvement on the old model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s easy to see right out of the box and after the first charge that it has much more power, which is a welcome change. It holds enough power for at least 8-10 brushings lasting about 3-3:30 minutes each. That&#x27;s a substantial improvement over the old Triumph, which didn&#x27;t perform that well even when new. My only complaint in the battery department is that this unit charges even more slowly than its predecessor, which used to recharge overnight. This new one needs to be recharged for the better part of a day if it has been used for several brushings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does a great job cleaning, and I even found on the day of transitioning from the old to the new model that my teeth felt instantly cleaner with a bit fewer rough spots. I have been very pleased with the cleaning action of the head on the Oral-B design for 6 years now, and since this one works just the same way, though with a bit more power, I&#x27;m confident I&#x27;ll be as happy with this one as with the last. At each of my cleanings, including one I recently had after having used this toothbrush for a number of weeks, the hygienist and dentist always compliment me on how little plaque I have, so that&#x27;s a compliment to the Oral-B design as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The build quality is superb. I can&#x27;t say I have a lot of use for the accessories (though I am thankful for the addition of a hard-plastic travel case) such as the \\&quot;SmartGuide,\\&quot; which really seems to be designed for parents of toddlers who are teaching their kids how to use a toothbrush.  I really don&#x27;t need a count-down (or count-up, depending on your taste) timer to know when I&#x27;ve brushed my teeth enough.  Teaching kids to brush, the SmartGuide may have some application, but for my purposes, it is of little more use than as a digital clock.  The only other \\&quot;mode\\&quot; I like to shift to brush in is the \\&quot;Plus\\&quot; mode, which gives me 45-second intervals without interruption pauses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The caddy holds 4 separate brush heads for 4 different users, and that may be useful for families with kids who share a bathroom and can, thus, share a power toothbrush body, keeping their brush heads separate (different colored rings are available for each brush head).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I&#x27;m very impressed that Oral-B has continued the tradition of quality and performance that I had grown used to over the years with their older power toothbrush, and I am also pleased that they&#x27;ve improved on the performance of the power cells. I thought the old brush was a 5-star product, so I can&#x27;t see that this one is anything less than a 5-star product either! Highly recommended, and the Amazon.com \\&quot;Frustration Free\\&quot; packaging on this unit is a welcome addition!compliment to the Oral-B design as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The build quality is superb.

            <li> This Oral-B Professional Healthy Clean Precision 5000 Electric Toothbrush is an updated version of the Oral-B SmartSeries 5000 Toothbrush.  I own both toothbrushes, and here are the differences between the two:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- The biggest change is with the on-handle display.  The old version had a small display which showed the charge level, in 4 different increments.  When the battery was low, the last bar on the screen would blink.  You could see the charge level at all times also.  With the new version, the display is gone, and has been replaced by LED lights (in 3 different increments).  The light is green when charged, and flashes red when the battery is low.  One annoying thing about the new version is the LED light turns off when not brushing.  So you can only see the charge level while the toothbrush is in use.  I prefer the old method where you can see the charge level at all times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- The charging cradle has been slightly improved.  The old version had a ring base that the toothbrush fit into.  The new one has a smaller base that the toothbrush is placed on.  Not a huge improvement, but I like the new one better because it doesn&#x27;t get your bathroom counter dirty with toothpaste residue.  Now you just need to clean the base.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- The 30 second notification to move to the next quadrant has changed.  Now, there is more of a noticeable stop after each 30 seconds (though it&#x27;s just a split second).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- The SmartTimer now has a star system that rates you on your brushing time.  If you go the full two minutes, all four stars will darken (and the smiley face on the display smiles).  If you skip out on the time, not all the stars will darken and you won&#x27;t see the smiley face.  This isn&#x27;t a big deal to me, but may provide positive reinforcement for those who find it hard to go the full 2 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So as you can see, the changes overall are pretty small.  If you have a SmartSeries 5000, you probably don&#x27;t need to upgrade to the new Precision 5000.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, the toothbrush performance is still stellar.  It provides 5 cleaning modes- daily clean, deep clean, sensitive, whitening, and massage.  You also have a variety of tooth brush heads to use.  I prefer the Floss Action, but my wife uses the Sensitive one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I have noticed is that you have to be careful with what type of toothpaste to use.  Some pastes create a lot more liquid than others while brushing, and you may find it tough to go a full 2 minutes without taking a break to spit it out.  I had to do trial and error with a few different brands to see which one I liked (Colgate Total seems to work well).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My dentist has seen improvement with these toothbrushes vs. the old SonicCare I used.  That is reason enough for me to splurge on these types of toothbrushes.recision 5000.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, the toothbrush performance is still stellar.

            <li> The headline says it all. I bought this product only because it was the fanciest looking and most expensive one of electric brushes I could find. I was ready to pay higher better quality, also the idea of having a screen to guide you brush sounded very developed to me. Not true. The screen is completely useless. It only shows you mode which you don&#x27;t need to see, and the time which again you don&#x27;t need to see since the brush beeps anyways every 30 seconds. On top of that is bigger and heavier than other models and hence less practical. For worse the traveling case is so huge you shouldn&#x27;t expect to fit in a toiletry bag. Last it has 5 modes, one of the reasons I bought it at first. Guess what? You don&#x27;t need more than 2! The other three are absolutely made up and have no practical use. All other much cheaper models will  have 3 and much more convenient cases. Really, just buy another oral B and you&#x27;ll thank me forever.</li>
            <li> I have been using sonicare for about 5 years and I always felt that my teeth just doesn&#x27;t get the feeling of being clean. I am glad that I made the switch to Oral B with this model which I admit is not cheap by all means. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I still floss after brushing but I noticed that very few or no residual food &amp;#34;particles&amp;#34; are left behind at all compared to my previous toothbrush. I usually use the deep clean and the massage mode. To me the wireless guide is a very useful visual cue. The brush head also seems to be strong and sturdy that I think this will last me more than 3 months. Never regretted that I chose this toothbrush</li>
            <li> I had used a Sonicare for ten plus years and didn&#x27;t think there was anything  better.  I sure was wrong.  My Sonicare was beyond repair and I was tempted to buy another one.  Several of my coworkers kept telling me about  the Oral-B Professional and how great it is.  I decided to give it a try.  I sure am glad I did.  It is more than I expected.  Now I&#x27;m the one singing the praises of the Oral-B Professional to my friends, relatives, and acquaintances.  .</li>
            <li> It is a little louder than I expected, and it took 2 days to fully charge.  I have used this for a few days now, and I really like it.  Makes me want to go and brush my teeth. :)</li>
            <li> love it will not go back to manual brushing ,</li>
            <li> This was my first EXPENSIVE toothbrush purchase... While it does make my teeth whiter and clean, I stopped using it due to the fact that it irritates my teeth when using it. I have sensitive teeth and so the rotating head and vibrations due Nothing to help it. I don&#x27;t use it anymore because of the pain BUT I do like the little timer and smiley detector that tells you how well you brush your teeth. And all the parts work perfectly, I even use it in the shower. (Conserve water people)&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t have sensitive teeth this will probably be a life changing tooth brush.</li>
            <li> I decided to switch from the old fashion way of brushing your teeth so this is half a review of an electric toothbrush vs manual.  The electric toothbrush + timer makes it very easy to regularly brush correctly.  That is very nice.  But the whirling brush does splatter toothpaste around if you are not careful.</li>
            <li> Really quick review:&lt;br /&gt;Just like some other reviewers I was getting gum loss behind the teeth and the dentist warned me about it.  Plaque build-up kept happening and I brush and floss every day!  This product stopped all plaque and gum loss.  My teeth have never been so clean!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that I have it I can keep my teeth &amp;#34;Dentist Cleaning&amp;#34; clean for 6 months until the next check up.  In fact, they saw how good my teeth were doing and they probably were a little upset that I was having success.  No more expensive treatments sales pitches.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product. The wife and I agree it is the best.</li>
            <li> Original brush does not work for teeth.&lt;br /&gt;It is very difficult to clean my teeth. I wonder why.&lt;br /&gt;I assume that Floss Action Precision 5000 does not work for cleaning.</li>
            <li> After a couple weeks of using this toothbrush, I really enjoy it. The digital display is not really needed, but it is pretty cool to see the countdown....makes sure you cover every area in the 30 second time frames allowed.  I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> This is an excellent toothbrush with a surplus of features.  My teeth feel very clean when I am done using it.  It feels substantial and of high quality.  I expect to have this toothbrush for a very long time.  No regrets with this purchase.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing! Every time I use it, I feel like I&#x27;m at the dentist, except its a much more pleasant experience. The features are great, it doesn&#x27;t require any effort to brush my teeth like a regular toothbrush, simply hold it on your teeth, and the brush does all the work! I would recommend this product to anyone, its totally worth the money. Buy one now! Oral-B is the best!</li>
            <li> 26M needed to step up my big boy game and turn in the manual brush. Dentist recommended this, if you can afford it way worth it. Teeth feel great and it&#x27;s wayyyyy less effort. The timer keeps you honest</li>
            <li> Ever since the purchase of the Oral-B Professional Health + Floss Action Precision 5000, my check-ups at the dentist have been excellent. My dental hygienist told me that whatever I was doing to keep doing it. I will never go back to a manual toothbrush!!!! Excellent product and well worth the money!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had other electric brushes before and those they get the job done, I always liked the small powerful heads on the Oral-B ones. When I picked this one up I was extremely happy with it. I didn&#x27;t think I would use the digital time counter, but after I used it a few times I actually liked it. Plus I paid for it, might as well use it. Definitely worth the money. Zero problems with it so far. With two uses a day on a full charge, it can go about 4 days without being charged again. Also.... LOVE the travel case!!</li>
            <li> This thing really does the best job of brushing&lt;br /&gt;The charger is good and the timer is good&lt;br /&gt;Recommend to all</li>
            <li> In the beginning, this brush is great, like everything the good reviews states.&lt;br /&gt;But then I started noticing the red light that would light up when it senses you&#x27;re brushing too hard, lighting up even when I&#x27;m applying little pressure.&lt;br /&gt;Then as more time went on, the red light went up constantly, and now it can no longer hold a charge - I&#x27;d have to place it in the charger after every brush.&lt;br /&gt;I hope I only got a lemon, and that not all of them are like this??&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**UPDATE: 8/28/13**&lt;br /&gt;So I went through my warranty process and had the defective unit replaced. It seems I received a lemon in the original brush, as this replacement is awesome, even more than when I first bought the original brush. My teeth feels super clean and refreshed. Thank you for that, but I&#x27;m only going to change my rating from a 2-star to a 4-star as this should not have happened in the first place.</li>
            <li> The Oral B Professional Health Clean &amp; Brush Action Precision 500 defefinately exceeded every one of my expectations.  I Absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I want in an electronic toothbrush.  No complaints and my teeth always feel clean, would definitely recommend this brush.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy this toothbrush over my old Sonicare.  It cleans some spots much easier than a traditional or Sonicare brush.  I only wish it was a little quieter.</li>
            <li> Cleans well. Easy to use</li>
            <li> Not the longest lasting tooth brush. It gets the job done and I can really get in there to the back teeth and really feel like I cleaned my mouth sufficiently, but it takes forever to charge and my battery is already going out (I haven&#x27;t had it 6 months…) I will be buying a different brand next time, I don&#x27;t want to spend 100$ every year on a toothbrush that I have to buy 10$ heads for 4 times a year.</li>
            <li> got this for my wife , she loves them , they really look real</li>
            <li> It is nice that there is a timer that comes with it. The display also shows if I am brushing too hard. It helps quite a bit. I am giving it 4 stars out of 5 because Costco sells it at the same price but with 2 electric toothbrushes. However, it doesn&#x27;t have a timer and there is no display to show that one is brushing too hard. I should have shopped around.</li>
            <li> I just received my Oral B 5000, was excited to receive it so quick. Packaging is indeed frustration free. First thing I checked if it had a dual volt charger. Before I purchased this from Amazon, I did my research and found that a lot of people posted that the 4000 and 5000 come with Dual Voltage (100-240 v) charger, however, upon inspecting the charger it was 110 v only.&lt;br /&gt;I called Oral B customer support and they said that all their electrical toothbrushes sold in the US come with 110v chargers only. They do have a dual volt charger for sale, and I would have to buy this from them. Which is about $35. Funny thing is that it does come with a travel case, but I guess Oral B is telling you that you can only travel within the US or for the time that the battery will last or bring a manual toothbrush and leave your expensive electrical one at home. Come on Oral B we are in the 21 century, every \\&quot;travel\\&quot; device should come with dual volt capabilities. So very disappointing. I have already called Amazon and requested the return label. My rating is not on the toothbrush itself, which I never tried. I am sure its a great toothbrush. But I travel around the world for work, usually for weeks at a time, I would not be able to charge it. Hopefully this will help the next person looking for a \\&quot;travel\\&quot; toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS. The pictures of the packaging and charger on this post are not the same as the one I received. Mine did not have a large (thick) plug as in the pictures posted. The one I received just had a standard US plug attached to a white cable and on the other end it had the charger, which goes into the end of the toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;The charger details: 110-130V ac  50-60 Hz / 1,3 W&lt;br /&gt;Made in Germany&lt;br /&gt;Type: 3757&lt;br /&gt;Made by: Braun&lt;br /&gt;On the box of the charger it said: Cord: 98729493-07</li>
            <li> So far I really like this toothbrush, it works really well and doesn&#x27;t need a charge for quite awhile. It cleans my teeth nicely and is very convenient!</li>
            <li> LIKED THE COMPACT SIZE--THE HANDY CLOCK TO REMIND YOU HOW LONG TO BRUSH--THE SIGNAL THAT APPEARS IF YOU APPLY TOO MUCH PRESSURE.  TEETH FEEL SMOOTH AND CLEAN WHEN CYCLE COMPLETED.</li>
            <li> Bought two of these to use for home and travel. The brush itself gets a 5 (best electric toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever used and superior to Sonicare) but having a charger that is only 110-130v and not a universal charger drops the rating all the way to 1. Why design a portable charger and a travel carrying case when other than USA (and countries with 110-130v) you will destroy your unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The main problem that I have is that the charging base that came with this unit is only 110-130v and not the universal 110-240v. The product details and the pamphlet that came with the package does not specify what the rated voltage of the charger is. If I did not looked at the bottom of the charger I would have used it overseas and destroyed the unit. Now I&#x27;m stuck with two units that I can&#x27;t travel without the use of a transformer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does anyone know a way to get a charging base that is universal without returning the whole unit since you never know what type of charger you will get since it&#x27;s not part of the description???</li>
            <li> The little rack for the toothbrushes comes off if you don&#x27;t need it and the base is very small - great for traveling. I like the timer feature that beeps every 30 seconds (one, two, three or four little beeps depending on which half minute segment you&#x27;re on and the little visual timer helps if I&#x27;m not listening to the beeps and want to know how much time is left or when I have to change area. The case is great for travel, as well.</li>
            <li> The product came quickly and worked great.  The back cover for the smart clean receiver was hard to get off.  The floss action tip that comes with the product takes getting used to.  The traveling case is large and bulky.</li>
            <li> NOTE - My original review is wildly enthusiastic about a great product - however, over several months&#x27; use, I found the \\&quot;Floss Action\\&quot; heads (provided with this purchase) were too harsh and probably a bit dangerous:  it&#x27;s too easy to accidentally erode the gum line through regular use.  I still recommend the toothbrush but I now recommend discarding the \\&quot;Floss Action\\&quot; heads (too harsh) and instead, order the optional \\&quot;Sensitive Gum\\&quot; heads instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ORIGINAL REVIEW&lt;br /&gt;---------------&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s gadgety (my IT geek friends would like it) but what a cleaning job it does, even in hard to reach spots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was a Braun Oral B Sonic user for years.  I was tempted to upgrade to this model for some time, but was worried the rapid aggressive rotation would harm my sensitive gums.  Wow, was I wrong.  After less than two weeks I already am amazed by the remarkable results:  not just in cleaning, but also, in comfort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The design is exceedingly clever, helping you avoid excess force, actively warning you with lights and alerts to not apply excess pressure - very effective protection for sensitive tissues.  It actually gently massages the gums while cleaning, and for me, this is working well even in a delicate crown area where the gum has prior recession and which used to feel mildly sensitive throughout the day.  Now I grasp why it felt sensitive so much of the time:  it was improperly cleaned (for I was afraid to apply too much force to that sensitive area), and as a result, gum health was degrading.  With this new model, even this odd area is getting gentle, effective cleaning - and it no longer feels sensitive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning results are great, too.  Dinginess is brightening up.  And I&#x27;m a chronic coffee and tea drinker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My other reason for delay, was that this model seemed pricey (what if I didn&#x27;t like it?).  But I find it is correcting my gum and tooth care.  What price can you put on something revolutionary that genuinelyenhances your health?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For years, I&#x27;ve been going to two annual cleaning visits because I&#x27;ve always had trouble cleaning properly.  Next visit, I expect the hygienist to ask my new dental secret.  I fully expect to scale back to a single annual cleaning visit.  It&#x27;s that remarkable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE&lt;br /&gt;------&lt;br /&gt;The default \\&quot;Floss Action 3 pack brush head\\&quot; that ships with the unit is too harsh - and in my view has eroded my gum line over initial months&#x27; use.  I had more satisfactory results by ordering the \\&quot;Oral-B Professional Sensitive Gum Care Replacement Brush Head\\&quot; (also on Amazon).  As always, use any mechanical toothbrush with care.</li>
            <li> I was specifically looking for this version of the Oral-B brush. After receiving the product in a plain brown box I grew concerned it was a nock-off. So, I went to Best Buy and purchased the same version and did a comparison. The components from the Amazon product was of lesser value.</li>
            <li> I like it, but it takes some getting used to. The toothbrush bristle part is small but efficient. I like the two-minute timer.</li>
            <li> Purchased the original years ago, it lasted about 2-3 years before needing to be replaced due to being dropped (urgh). Bought another one and it lasted 4 years before the battery started going out on it. I am currently on my third of this model. Feel like I left the dentist after using each day. Teeth have never been cleaner. I used to get a lot of cavities and bleeding gums, this has taken care of all those issues. Well worth the savings I get from not having to pay high dental bills. I plan on buying another when this one goes out.</li>
            <li> My husband and I had seen TV ads for this toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;We had been using a sonic type brush for several years,&lt;br /&gt;but he thought the Professional 5000 would give us more&lt;br /&gt;cleaning and flossing action.  I thought the small &amp;#34;flippers&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;would be hard on my gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We went for our simi-annual cleanings about 3 week ago.&lt;br /&gt;On the way home, my husband wanted to stop to buy the&lt;br /&gt;Professional 5000 because he believed it would help us&lt;br /&gt;keep that professional cleaning.  I had to tell him I had&lt;br /&gt;already bought the Professional 5000 for his Christmas&lt;br /&gt;gift.  Needless to say, this gift did not make it under the&lt;br /&gt;tree, it went directly into use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m happy to report the Professional 5000 lives up to all of&lt;br /&gt;the claims made in the ads.  It took a couple of days to get&lt;br /&gt;use to the more forceful action of the head, but I admit that&lt;br /&gt;it truly provides excelent cleaning. We still have that &amp;#34;just&lt;br /&gt;out of the dentist&#x27;s clean&amp;#34; feel.  We feel certain that our&lt;br /&gt;dentist will see a difference on our next visit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We would highly recommend the Oral-B Professional 5000.</li>
            <li> They are gifts for my parents, and they enjoy using this &amp;#34;professional&amp;#34; tooth brush.&lt;br /&gt;The whole kit includes everything you need.&lt;br /&gt;If they could sell it with more brushes in the kit, then the product might be perfect.</li>
            <li> Great Toothbrush&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love all the different cleaning options that this toothbrush has to offer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Love it - always thought I did a good job brushing until I used this!  I think my next cleaning will show much less plaque than usual.</li>
            <li> My peridontist said the health of my gums and teeth were deterioting and that I should try this electric toothbrush.  I did, and wonder why I hadn&#x27;t done this earlier (I probably was scared off by the price).  However, this toothbrush does an excellent job way beyond the results I was gettilng with my regular toothbrush.  It is quicker and easier that I thought it would be.  I like that it keeps me informed as to which quadrant I am on, and how long I have been brushing on it.  It exceeds my expectations, and I love it. If it lasts as long as I do I will have completely forgotten about the price.</li>
            <li> Yes I would recomend this to anyone. I love the brush and the clock My only thing I do not like is that if you want it on the softer setting you have to reprogram the brush every day.</li>
            <li> It has really made a difference in how clean my mouth feels.  Easy to use and the timer reminds me not to rush when I&#x27;m late for work.</li>
            <li> Feels like when my dentist cleans my teeth.  Gums feel great after brushing.  When traveling, the power held up for a week without charge.  Very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush saved my teeth.  Been using it for at least five years and my old one just quit on me.&lt;br /&gt;Had pretty bad periodontal issues and now have none.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned a few oral-b electric toothbrushes over the last few decades and have enjoyed them all.  This latest, the 5000, replaces my Plaque Remover 3D.  I got to see a Triumph at my oral hygenist and realized that the newer ones were faster and with more capabilities than my old one so I upgraded. First off, it took a few times to get use to the idea of staying in a quadrant until it tells you to move on to the next.  I also like the feature that warns you when you&#x27;re pushing too hard and also appreciate the deep cleaning cycle. My wife, who goes through brush heads way too fast has had to adjust as well.  We haven&#x27;t used the polishing cycle yet but can tell you that this is a whole new experience in cleaning your teeth and one you can tell is making a difference.</li>
            <li> I bought this because my wife has one and loves it.  Oral-B has changed it.  The battery doesn&#x27;t hold a charge as long as my wife&#x27;s before it needs recharging.  The battery display on hers is far superior, actual display instead of idiot lights that flash for 10 seconds and then disappear.  I feel Oral-B has taken a step backward.  I recommend it with those reservations .</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush.  It cleans so much better than the Sonicare I owned previously.  My dental hygienist recommended this model as it is the one that she uses and she is very fussy about teeth cleaning. She feels that the rotary motion is far superior to the sonic waves.  It also has a timer with a digital readout I can watch that beeps when you have spent 30 seconds on each quadrant of your mouth. I go from tooth to tooth slowly, applying a little pressure at the gum line of each and find that it takes exactly 30 seconds to clean each quadrant.  My teeth feel so good after brushing now.  Last office cleaning, my hygienist told me she had to look for the plaque, there was so little.  What an improvement!  I highly recommend this Oral-B.  The rotary system is the best.</li>
            <li> I have tried many brands and models, but this one is my go to! When my original Oral B 5000 broke (due to me dropping it several times) I was very sad as I know the normal cost of a new one, but thanks to Amazon I could afford a replacement brush immediately, and best of all it was delivered in 2 days thanks to amazon prime!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been an Oral-B fan for a while now, and I was eager to try out this new Precision 5000 after my old Oral-B&#x27;s power button gave up the ghost. This revised Precision 5000 is a really solid toothbrush, easy to set up, and works just fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Begin Rant*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, there&#x27;s one incredibly annoying difference between this toothbrush and the older Precision line: Every 30 seconds on this toothbrush, the motor pauses and the brush beeps. At 30 seconds it pauses and beeps once, at 60 seconds it pauses and beeps twice, at 90 seconds three times, and at 120 seconds four times. It&#x27;s this incredibly obnoxious high-pitched beep/s, and that they increase in number every 30 seconds drives me nuts. I really, really dislike it, and I tend to watch the timer so that I know when to pause brushing. There&#x27;s something really uncomfortable about brushing your teeth with an electric toothbrush that isn&#x27;t actually on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*End Rant*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My previous Precision Oral-B did not used to have these beeps, and instead the motor just vibrated every 30 seconds to let you know to move on to the next quadrant of your mouth. This was much less invasive, and hopefully Oral-B will go back to this style, since nothing should be interrupting our teeth brushing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is a very solid unit. If the beeps/pauses don&#x27;t annoy you, there&#x27;s very little to dislike here. The charging base is better than the last generation (which allowed mucky water/toothpaste to drip down it onto your bathroom counter), and overall it works just great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4 stars out of 5.</li>
            <li> I have been using and enjoying an Oral-B Triumph toothbrush for several years; which worked flawlessly until recently.  The charging capacity suddenly started dropping drastically, to where I would have to charge it about once every 2 days.  I was offered the ability to test and review this new Oral-B Healthy Clean + Floss Precision 5000 toothbrush, which I gratefully accepted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unboxing the new product, and now after using it for the past month, I can honestly say that it is extremely similar to my previous Triumph model Oral-B device.  Size and weight are about the same.  It is just as noisy as my previous toothbrush as well.  My old Triumph handle had an LCD display, to show battery level and charging status.  This new handle uses LED lighting instead, which only lights up when the handle is powered on and for a few seconds after being powered off.  The Floss Action brush heads haven&#x27;t changed , but I do like the selection of 5 cleaning modes (regular clean, deep clean, sensitive, whitening, and massage).  I was discouraged to see that Oral-B didn&#x27;t include the variety of head attachments that they did with my previous model.  The new Precision 5000 only came with a single Floss Action head, while my Triumph came with the same Floss Action head, and added a Sensitive head, a Power Tip head, Pro White head, and some kind of tongue cleaner head.  Then again, considering the substantially lower cost of this new Precision 5000 model, compared to my high priced Triumph 9900 from 5 or more years ago, I guess I can see why they left out a few of the extra frills.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The new Smart Guide display is cute and informative, but I do not find it extremely useful.  It lights up one star for every 30 seconds you brush, and the goal is to light up 4-stars to indicate you have brushed for the recommended 2 minutes.  You are even presented with a big smiley face, to give you that extra sense of pride in what you have accomplished.  It will provide you with a bonus star (5-stars in all) if you brush for an additional 30 seconds or more.  The best part is, if you brush long enough to get that extra bonus star, you will sometimes (not every time) be greeted with a winking smiley face.  Now who wouldn&#x27;t like that?  The Smart Guide also shows you what brushing mode you are using, displays an icon to show you when it is time to replace your brush head, and also has a red (might be dark orange) lighted indicator to warn if you are pressing against your teeth too hard with the brush.  There is a rather large LED light on the back of the powered brush handle as well, which flashes brightly if you are applying too much pressure when brushing.  I really like the light on the handle, as it prevents the need for the user to keep watching the Smart Guide display (which can sometimes be difficult to see from a distance).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Precision 5000 series toothbrush, like all other Oral-B powered brushes I have used, does a splendid job of cleaning my teeth.  My dentist has had nothing but good things to say about my teeth and gums since I started using my Oral-B Triumph several years ago.  It provides a comfortable and stimulating scrubbing action to your teeth and gum-line, but isn&#x27;t overly aggressive to cause discomfort.  This scrubbing action does a great job of removing plaque, preventing stains, and the Floss Action heads do well at getting between teeth and removing food particles.  The Oral-B Precision 5000 is far from being whisper quiet, so be prepared for a little noise once you switch it on.  It is also a little bulky, and has s fair amount of weight to it.  I don&#x27;t find it to be clumsy or heavy at all, and enjoy the solid feel of the handle overall.  The handle is waterproof, and has a good rubbery grip surface.  My only real complaint about the new Precision 5000 series toothbrush is the pause in brushing every 30 seconds.  While I understand the concept behind the physical feedback, to let you know it&#x27;s time to switch quadrants in your mouth, and that the physical feedback eliminates the need to watch the LCD display for visual indicators, I don&#x27;t appreciate the interruption in the brushing motion.  In fact, every 30 seconds the pause gets longer, so that you can hear this faint little beep that grows in number during each pause.  So, after the first thirty seconds you get a very short pause, with a single beep.  After another 30 seconds you get a pause twice as long, with two beeps.  By the time you get to the fourth pause, it is so long that you just stand there looking at yourself awkwardly in the mirror, waiting for the stupid thing to start brushing again.  The engineer that came up with this concept should be slapped silly, in my honest opinion!  My wife has a Sonicare toothbrush that provides a really short stutter in brushing action every 30 seconds, which doesn&#x27;t interrupt the brushing process, but provides enough feedback to alert the user that another 30 seconds has passed.  I think Braun (Oral-B) needs to hire the engineer from Sonicare, to redesign their feedback system, which would bring this device closer to being a 5-star product.  As it is now, I consider the Oral-B Precision 5000 power toothbrush to be a solid 4 to 4 and ½ star product.  It does a great job cleaning my teeth, and I have very few complaints about its style, build quality, or feature set.  Cleaning our teeth should be treated as a vital element of one&#x27;s daily personal hygiene regimen, and I highly recommend the [[ASIN:B008PEMOV6 Oral-B Professional Healthy Clean + Floss Action Precision 5000 Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush]] as the right tool for the job.rants in your mouth, and that the physical feedback eliminates the need to watch the LCD display for visual indicators, I don&#x27;t appreciate the interruption in the brushing motion.

            <li> It&#x27;s better than advertised. Really cleans my teeth and I love the timer. I would recommend using the sensitive mode until your get use to the brush.</li>
            <li> I bought this toothbrush about a year ago. Overall, I really like it - it replaced a Sonicare (well, two, actually) that both broke.&lt;br /&gt;PROS: -&lt;br /&gt;1. It feels solid and well made and brushes vigorously;&lt;br /&gt;2. Notwithstanding the vigorous brushing comment, it tells you (via a red light on the brush) if you are overdoing it;&lt;br /&gt;3. It comes with a handy clock - as others have commented, you don&#x27;t actually need this to time your brushing as the brush itself buzzes and vibrates every thirty seconds during brushing to tell you to switch quadrants in your mouth - but it&#x27;s really handy to have in the bathroom when you are wondering what the time is;&lt;br /&gt;CONS: -&lt;br /&gt;1. Only one really: the power runs down quite quickly (admittedly, my wife and I both use this brush) but it then takes FOR - E - VER to recharge. Perhaps I have a slightly dud battery, but if the power is down to one bar on the brush, you can put it on to charge first thing in the morning and it is still winking away charging late that evening.</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush.  I only use 1-mode, so not sure it&#x27;s worth the extra cash, but I do like the timer.</li>
            <li> My family loves this toothbrush. We&#x27;ve been using it for almost a year, and it&#x27;s still working as new.</li>
            <li> Been using this for ages now... It took me quite awhile, trying to find the right one, and for me, this is it... It&#x27;s reliable, it&#x27;s easy to use, holds a charge for quite awhile, everything I wanted and expected in an electric toothbrush...</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s great - still working perfectly 2 years later</li>
            <li> Long lasting on battery charge &amp; does a great job on my teeth.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t care for this toothbrush at all.  It has four small rubber paddles that were really harsh on my gums.  And the plastic hit my teeth and my last electric toothbrush did not.  It was jarring but I was afraid I would chip a toot.  The little timer was just a waste of money.  I had high hopes, but the little paddles just beat up my gums.</li>
            <li> the built in timer was something I thought was just a gimmick but found it to be very satisfying.  My teeth are whiter, cleaner and healthier.  My dentist, whom I see every three months noticed immediately.  The Oral B paid for itself by extending dentist visits to 6 months instead of every three.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately the smart guide display didn&#x27;t work from the beginning. Many emails and phone calls resulted with me sending. o my account, the entire unit to Quebec (I live in Vancouver, BC). Well I decided to give up and just suck it. Too bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush it self is wonderful and I am very happy with.</li>
            <li> It really does a great job cleaning your teeth.  Have used oral&#x3D;B for a few years, get great check ups at the dentist since I started using oral-b.  The timer is a good way guide you on how long to brush.</li>
            <li> I purchased two of these one for myself and one for my fiance. Finally upgraded after 15 years. The old one that I have still works to this day. But I am loving this new model works great and the 5 options of speed is a plus. Now my dentist visit for cleaning are cut in half of the time. Highly recommended, Thanks oral-B.</li>
            <li> This is a great product and I highly recommend it. It is easy to use and works well in all areas of the mouth, including the hard-to-get back areas of the mouth.</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended this toothbrush because she said I was brushing to hard with my regular tooth brush. I use the setting for sensitive teeth, and my gums are getting better.  After brushing, my teeth feel like I just had them cleaned at the dentist office.  I would recommend it to everyone.  I&#x27;m thinking this would make a great Christmas gift.</li>
            <li> I have always had a terrible time cleaning my back teeth due to an over active gag reflex. This electric toothbrush is unbelievably effective! I use the floss-action head and I have NEVER gotten this type of cleaning from ANY toothbrush at home before. I feel like I&#x27;ve been to the dentist for a professional cleaning. I use the deep cleaning mode and my teeth are very clean. They are also a few shades whiter after using this for only a week! I&#x27;m very impressed!</li>
            <li> very usable and love the brush, really cleans by 73 year old teeth and keeps them in great shape! No dentures for me</li>
            <li> Amazon&#x27;s frustration free packaging was great - Oral-B needs to take some tips from them.  Timer cover difficult to remove and set up plus the controls are awkwardly placed.  Initial charge took about 15 hours to complete.&lt;br /&gt;Bought this to replace the Zila Rotadent which I&#x27;d left behind on my last trip to my mom&#x27;s.  While I&#x27;m enjoying the clean feeling from brushing as the 5000 does seem to give me better brushing results, I am not sure I would recommend the brush.  I shouldn&#x27;t have to consult a manual to set up a toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I had a friend who used this tooth brush and I always thought it was overkill compared to my $10 toothbrush. Anyways after a few months of my teeth not feeling clean enough I decided to go ahead and buy this. I&#x27;m not disappointed! My teeth and mouth feel much cleaner.</li>
            <li> My teeth haven&#x27;t felt so clean! We ordered two one for our bathroom and one for our granddaughters bathroom. It is wonderful and it helps her brush her teeth correctly.</li>
            <li> The pros I talked with say Oral-B is the best toothbrush available. It&#x27;s twice as effective at cleaning than a manual toothbrush, and slightly more effective than Sonic Care (which I enjoy using.) This is a technical machine that will take more reading of the manual and training on my part. But if you like all the bells and whistles, this is the unit for you. I&#x27;m just a beginner. But after using, I did notice my mouth had never felt cleaner (except when I come from the dentist).</li>
            <li> I had the Oral B 1000 which broke down. Its voltage was 110-220 as it is supposed to be since it is something you carry with you when you travel overseas.  I bought this 5000 thinking that it was same voltage 110-220... I tried to charge it for the first time overseas where it is 220. It did not do anything. I think the charged got burned. I don&#x27;t know what to do now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am extremely disappointed to throw $100 on this oral B.....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WHY DIDN&#x27;T ORAL B NOTE THE VOLTAGE ON THE DESCRIPTION HERE... IT IS NOT EVEN NOTED IN THE CATALOG.</li>
            <li> Does everything the description said it would. Convenient because it takes up minimal room on the counter. I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a Sonic Care, then a WaterPik, and finally I found this to be the best all-around electric toothbrush and decided to make the purchase. Overall, I&#x27;m really glad I did! It took a full 24 hours to fully charge up initially, but the battery lasts for a good week of brushing on just one charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also like the automatic sync to the timer. The timer automatically prompts you to brush each section of your mouth, and after the 30 (or 45) seconds on each quadrant, you can still brush longer if you want; the brush does not automatically shut down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like the floss head on the deep clean mode. It leaves my mouth feeling dentist-clean every day. I plan to buy the whitening brush as well to try it out. The head fits nicely in the mouth and around each tooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One note: the handle is quite bulky, but it is comparable to all other electric brushes on the market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> This one was a gift.....but I have the same toothbrush and love it.  Works great and makes my teeth feel really clean.  Had made my dental cleanings easier too!</li>
            <li> Meets expectations.  Went on vacation for 7 days and did NOT need the charging base. It says that there are 5 settings but I only noticed three.</li>
            <li> It is a great tooht brush, a big change from my old oral-b tooht brush I had. I should have updated along time ago.</li>
            <li> Even shows you if you are brushing too hard.  The timer is very helpful, and I really do find myself with a cleaner mouth (or so I feel it).  My Dentist asked if I changed any habits, and I told him I have been using this for 2 months and he noticed a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The clock is nice, but not necessary, but does double as a bathroom clock.  Highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> My dental hygienist is very, very happy with the way the Oral-B Professional 5000 is working for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the Philips electric toothbrush for about a year before I left it behind when traveling and the housekeeping staff threw it away. : (  I liked it very much - very nice sleek design and charging options, not too loud, teeth felt really clean . . . but the dental hygienist didn&#x27;t comment on how nice my teeth were until I came in after using the Oral-B Professional 5000 for six months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After losing the Phillips Sonicare Diamond, I read the reviews of the Oral-B Professional 5000 and decided to try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the options and the visual display.  I&#x27;m pretty easily motivated by getting &#x27;gold stars&#x27; and seeing the little face get &#x27;happier&#x27; when I brush longer.  Seems petty, but if it works, that&#x27;s good for my teeth.  It is clunkier looking than the Philips, and noisier, but I really don&#x27;t need quiet while I brush my teeth anyway and I&#x27;m not designing my bathroom for Architectural Digest.  If you like really sleek design and neat gadgets, the Philips travel case and charging options are much nicer.  If you want simple practicality (really do I need to plug my toothbrush charger into a USB port?) the Oral-B travel case is smaller and lighter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought the Oral-B toothbrush would arrive with the full assortment of brush heads, but it only arrived with one brush head (unlike the Philips which had a larger and a smaller brush head).  I ordered the floss-action brush head and the tip for cleaning around bridges and the gum line. I hate flossing and I use these to reduce the need to use dental floss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you already have the Philips, you probably aren&#x27;t looking to replace it, and I wouldn&#x27;t.  But if you need a new electric toothbrush, I recommend the Oral-B Professional 5000.</li>
            <li> This product works great! I love the &amp;#34;fresh from the dentist&amp;#34; feel after using this.  I really do not think the timer/clock is necessary for an adult, although I do pay attention to the time while brushing.  Once you have set the clock up, bluetooth takes care of the rest, which is a cool feature. I have not traveled with it yet, so I&#x27;m not sure how long the battery will last while not being charged. As for an electric toothbrush, this is all in all a great product.</li>
            <li> My $15 electric toothbrush finally died after 7 years.  A dental hygienist friend recommended this Oral B 5000 to me.  Normally I wouldn&#x27;t think to spend $100 on a toothbrush, but since my last one had lasted so long, I thought what the heck.  I am VERY glad I invested the money.  This toothbrush is amazing!  It vibrates a lot more than my old one, and I can tell it is cleaning my teeth better.  I really enjoy the beep/brief pause at each 30 second interval that signifies for you to move to the next quarter of your mouth, as well as the timer.  I know I NEVER brushed for a full two minutes before, and I never focused on a quarter at a time.  This toothbrush really makes a difference.  I like the round heads a lot better than regular toothbrush heads like sonicare.  My husband, who always uses regular manual toothbrushes, used this once and has since converted.  I definitely recommend, and who can resist the smiley face when your two minutes of brushing is up.  :)  We don&#x27;t have children, but I get giggly from the smiley so I bet this toothbrush would encourage better children brushing as well.  :)</li>
            <li> Been using this toothbrush for 2 months now and I am very satisfied with it.  Bought additonnal brushing heads and everybody in my family is now using it...  My teeth are now much cleaner than while I was using a regular toothbrush</li>
            <li> We  have owned different Oral B power toothbrushes over the years with the latest being the 1000 and the 4000.  I have no complaints with the 1000 or 4000 they both work well.  The kids use the 1000 and we used the 4000&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you currently have a 4000 I do not believe there is any reason to upgrade to the 5000 even though have a digital display is nice but not a must have. You could always start the 4000 cycle again if you want an equal to the deep clean mode&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When determining if one should purchase the 5000 over the 1000 or upgrade from the 1000, one needs to look at the additional features the 5000 provides&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why buy the 5000&lt;br /&gt;- If you have sensitive gums then you should purchase the 5000 because there is a gentle mode.  Additionally, I would not recommend purchasing the floss action heads if you have sensitive gums.&lt;br /&gt;- Digital Display.  If you want to watch where you are in the brushing cycle then buy the 5000.  The 1000 does not have a display but it does beep to notify you when to move to a new area.&lt;br /&gt;- Stained teeth.  The 5000 has a teeth whitening mode. I do not see any difference when using the teeth whitening mode, however, I do not have stains to determine if the feature works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I recommend the Oral B 5000, I would suggest using the 1000 if you do not have sensitive or stained teeth.  This will save you money to buy more heads.</li>
            <li> It cleans really really well. You can feel it. Since it has been recommended by dentists it makes this purchase better. I was skeptical about spending $one hundred dollars in a toothbrush but it is well worth it. I even purchased my kids the Oral-B 3d White Action Rechargeable Toothbrush. Did not want to spend that on the kids. They love theirs too.&lt;br /&gt;I also love the 2 min setting in 30 sec intervals for precise cleaning. Love it!</li>
            <li> I have owned several Electric Tooth Brushes but this was the absolute best. love the way my teeth feels.. clean</li>
            <li> Love it! Love it! Love it! I actually loved it from the first time that I used it. I liked it so much better than a tooth brush. After just two weeks of using it, my hygenist could tell such a difference. I was having to have my teeth cleaned every 3 months because of my bleeding gums and not flossing. After just two weeks my gums showed significant improvement, as well as, whatever showed such improvement between my teeth and the stains from drinking tea and coffee everyday- she couldn&#x27;t even remember I had the stains. I decided to buy ones for my son and daughter&#x27;s families. My daughter-in-law loves it so much that she&#x27;s now buying one for her mother. Everyone should buy one NOW!</li>
            <li> This is in my opinion the best toothbrush in the world. Easy to use, powerful, efficient, and cost-effective as well!!!</li>
            <li> This is a great rechargeable toothbrush. It has all sorts of settings for a variety of brushing needs. It was worth the money because now my teeth feel dentist clean all the time!</li>
            <li> AWFUL!!! I have had Oral-B brushes for a long time and loved them, but this has a very hard head that makes brushing uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> Product image supplied by Amazon customer indicates this is a dual voltage 110/220 device. However the charger is 110V only. Returned immediately. Product includes a travel case for the brush. Just don&#x27;t travel to Europe!</li>
            <li> I am waiying for my dental check in a few weeks.  From the performance, I guess my dentist will be asking what new is happening to my mouth.  My mouth feels super clean.  It does sound like a caterpillar tractor is excavating when brushing.</li>
            <li> too strong for my sensitive teeth but a good product.</li>
            <li> I really like this - I wish there were more information on ordering and using more of the different heads available.</li>
            <li> I bought this toothbrush because I have trouble brushing to hard.  After lots of research, I decided on this one.  The brush is easy to use, has superior cleaning power and I love the fact that it tells me when I&#x27;m brushing to hard.  It also tells you how long to brush in each quarant of your mouth.  My teeth feel very clean after each use. I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> The whole family(3 of us) is using it. One downfall is that replacement brushes are little pricey. Love the features, such as timer and pressure sensitivity alarm.</li>
            <li> As good as I had hoped.  I find this easy to use.  Reaches tough spots and is gentle on the gums.</li>
            <li> I love this tooth brush. Super fun to use, no problems at all in the past 6 months.&lt;br /&gt;Overall good product if you are fine with spending almost 100 dollar on a tooth brush. It is worth it!!! ;-)</li>
            <li> This is a great brush; it does everything that it  claims to do. The quality and the size &amp; balance are very good.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush rattles when it runs, which tells me it won&#x27;t last too long...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do like this toothbrush.  It gets my teeth very clean and is easy to move around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one thing that ruins that is that it STOPS (they say it beeps) every 30 seconds to remind me to change quadrants.  So I finally set up the SmartGuide so I could change that.  The battery cover was almost impossible to open (I pried it open), and the buttons in it are sharp and piercing to the finger.  I finally got that set up and then was told I had to synchronize the brush.  Well, I tried, but that simply wouldn&#x27;t work.  At all.  It got to L-- but then it would time out.  So then I went to pull the mount off the wall and throw it out, and that had already set in 10 minutes and nearly pulled the paint off the wall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess now I have a brush I like.  That stops all the time.  I won&#x27;t keep it very long, but at least I don&#x27;t have to look at that vapid happy face.</li>
            <li> i love how clean my teeth are. this is the first electric toothbrush for me and i&#x27;m sold. maybe i didn&#x27;t need the timer but now i have a clock in my bathroom.  : )</li>
            <li> My teeth feel so much cleaner over a manual toothbrush. I will buy Oral-B again when this one goes, hopefully not for a few years.</li>
            <li> I love the timer that beeps every 30 seconds so you can give equal time to all areas of your mouth</li>
            <li> Good product, my last one lasted 10 yrs. or better, finally had to get a new one, the battery wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge any longer. Don&#x27;t need the timer, clock guizmo. This thing is hands down better than the old models, which I was happy with. This has a lot more power and pulsations than the old one.  The only draw back is it takes a long time to re-charge. It takes at least 24hrs. for a full charge. It does last a week on a charge.  We will see if this one lasts as long as my old one did.  Overall I recomend this product</li>
            <li> Switched from Sonicare to this. Seems to clean better, I&#x27;m anxious to to see how we&#x27;ll it holds up and retains its charge.</li>
            <li> This product has flossing action.  It times how long you brush and tells you if you are brushing too hard.  I am happy I got this tooth brush and would buy it again. it arrived on time and was well packaged.</li>
            <li> There are a confusing array of electric toothbrushes out there and it can be very hard to decide which features are useful.  I have found the Braun Oral B toothbrushes to be of consistently good quality.  The Floss Action brush heads do such an effective job that my dentist always compliments me on how well I floss.  I never floss. This brush in particular does a very effective job and has very useful speeds.  The charge really does last 5 days, and the travel case is much more functional than the ziplock bag I used to use.  I also like the little timer that reminds me to change quadrants every 30 or 45 seconds and displays a little frown-y face when I brush with excessive vigor, which I apparently do most of the time.  I find that by setting it high on a shelf it is out of the way, and looking up at it keeps toothpaste foam from running down my chin.</li>
            <li> I just bought this toothbrush and so far I like it. I had the same one before but had to toss it because the battery died. I hope that will not happen again with this one.</li>
            <li> This is a great tooth brush the best I have ever bought! I love oral b product because they do what they were meant to do! Do hesitate to purchase this brush because your teeth are worth every penny and you need your teeth for the rest of your life it a small investment in your oral care regimen! Buy it you won&#x27;t regret it!!!!!  The smart guide helps you stay on track and brush each quadrant and brush for 2 minutes also you have different cleaning modes and it really brushes your teeth! But it bottom line!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this toothbrush for several months now and I&#x27;m really pleased. One of the things I really like is the the way the two minute timer works. It counts the seconds on a little clock and pauses every 30 seconds to remind you to divide the brushing time equally among the four quadrants of your mouth. I&#x27;ve used a similar toothbrush for years and didn&#x27;t always brush the full two minutes because it seemed so long. With this toothbrush, I can keep one eye on the little clock and it makes the time go by very quickly. I always brush the full time!  For one thing, silly as it sounds, I&#x27;m motivated by the happy face that appears on the clock when i complete the two minutes and remains there until the next time I brush. One time I had to turn the toothbrush off to answer the phone and it displayed a sad face.  I couldn&#x27;t wait to brush again to change it to a smile!  I feel like my teeth are cleaner than they were before, when I used a different brand  I  went to the dentist recently and the hygienist commented on how clean my teeth were.  I am now a loyal fan of the Oral B Floss Action toothbrush!</li>
            <li> If your teeth build up plaque faster than you can remove it with a manual tooth brush this oral B professional tooth brush may be right for you.&lt;br /&gt;Modern teeth cleaning by dental hygenists can be a painful experience to remove large buildups of plaque.&lt;br /&gt;This electric toothbrush claims to remove 99% + of plaque with regular use. I does a better job than lower priced electric toothbrushes due to a sonic action that aids the mechanical action in cleaning your teeth&lt;br /&gt;It is easy to use and has a wireless remote that counts the time when you start brushing so that you brush your teeth for a minimum of 2 minutes twice a day as recommended by dentists. The timing breaks your brushing into 4X 30 second intervals for each quadrant ( 1/4 ) of your mouth.&lt;br /&gt;i.e upper left top of mouth / upper right top of mouth / lower left bottom of mouth / and lower right bottom of mouth.&lt;br /&gt;The remote beeps and the toothbrush breifly pauses brushing when you have finished brushing each quarter or your teeth and it is time to move on to a new quarter of your teeth. There are several brush head options available for this toothbrush&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll see what the dental hygenist thinks on my next dental checkup</li>
            <li> Brushing your teeth with this appliance is like ramming a canon into your mouth.  It is bulky and very difficult to use around your cheeks, which is pretty much everywhere in your mouth.  I don&#x27;t know if other brands are better or worse, but for me, I am sticking with my old fashion toothbrush as opposed to a brushing device like this one.  I was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Great replacement for my old Oral B brush.  Uses the same heads, which is good because I had a supply of them.  The timer is nice feature, as well as the indicator that shows if you are pressing down too hard.  Only wish the stand had a wall mount.  I will have to adapt something.</li>
            <li> I have used a cybersonic for about 20 years and really liked it.....until it died.  I have only had this Oral-B a couple of week and will write an update in a few months.  I am hopeful that I will like what it does for my teeth and gums.  It has one detraction for me in that it is much louder than my old cybersonic.  However, I am prepared to put up with a bit more noise if it does what it is supposed to do.</li>
            <li> I like the Oral B toothbrush but.....it is very different from my Sonicare toothbrush. I switched to Oral B because the heads on my previous two Sonicare toothbrushes, kept coming loose. My last one barely made it to one year. So, I switched to Oral B. It is really loud, and it kind of feels like you have a weed whacker in your mouth. It&#x27;s not as comfortable to use as the Sonicare was. I really like how easy it is to get the brush heads on and off with the Oral B. The Sonicare was often a tug of war to get the heads off. That is probably the reason the heads became loose, and caused the toothbrush to not work. I will stick with the Oral B, it does a great job brushing my teeth and hopefully it will last longer than a year. I am switching out the brush heads for the sensitive teeth brush heads. I think that will solve the weed whacking sensation.</li>
            <li> Oral-B really is the best out there. I was hesitant to get an electronic toothbrush. But, after reading the reviews, went with this one. I am so happy with it. I&#x27;m a little fickle about brushing my teeth and flossing. I love that if I have a lazy day and don&#x27;t want to floss, after using this tooth brush, Its as if I flossed any way. I have a lot of buildup at the base of my bottom front teeth that my dentist is constantly wanting me to take care of. It didn&#x27;t matter how many times a day I flossed, it would continually build up. My last dentist appt was 4 months ago and my teeth are still build up free... that&#x27;s pretty impressive in my book. Also, I like that the battery lasts pretty long. I haven&#x27;t explored the other settings than the original but, overall, I&#x27;m very impressed with it.</li>
            <li> My dentist suggested I look into an Oral B brush so I chose this one. I found out I really do not need/use the extra clock included because the built in timer in the brush handle beeps when you should brush a different quadrant.  Since I bought this, my dentist has seen good result when I go in for my appointments.</li>
            <li> Battery not good after less than two years use, not a disaster but I had better experience with prior Oral-B products</li>
            <li> The teeth never felt better, great product that I can highly recommend.  Should have switched to an electric brush years ago</li>
            <li> Great electric tooth brush I purchased to replace an old Oral B that lasted over 15 years.  It has been awhile since I purchased an electric tooth brush, and so far, we pleased with our new addition to our bathroom shelf.  I stayed with same brand name, Oral B,  out of brand loyalty and I am pleased with all the new bells and whistles far different from my ancient electric tooth.  If I had kids, especially with braces etc, what a great tooth brush.  But for this Granny...Gramps and me love this bells whistling model for our oral care!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these Oral B brushes for many years and have had better checkups with these than I had years ago using the Sonicare product.  It works so well, that the hygienist keeps asking how I keep my teeth so clean!  I tell her that I introduced the Flintsones to the Jetsons long ago and switched to the Oral B with the Floss Action head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Setting the timer doodle is a little challenging, but that is a minor unnecessary improvement in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great brush, can&#x27;t go wrong with this unit.</li>
            <li> I am really enjoying using the Oral-B Professional Healthy Clean + Floss action Precision 5000 electric toothbrush.  It&#x27;s easy to use and my mouth feels really clean!</li>
            <li> I always read reviews, but never write them.  This product is worth writing about!  I smoked for 15 years and after quiting, I tried everything to whiten my teeth.  To no avail, nothing worked.  I then decided to buy a good electric toothbrush based off a recommendation from a friend.  I&#x27;m glad I listened.  Not only are my teeth very visibly whiter, they are extremely clean.  The difference between a regular toothbrush and this brush is night and day.  If you purchase this toothbrush, you will not be disappointed!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m amazed by how much cleaner my teeth feel - it sounds corny but I kept smiling just to see my teeth :)</li>
            <li> First of all me and my wife are orthodontists, so I know what I am talking about.&lt;br /&gt;We received this toothbrush as a gift in a conference. We start using this toothbrush and after 3 uses, my wife told me she did not like it because it was very hard. I continue to use it until I realized I was loosing my gums! I know how to brush and how much force to apply, and as a result of that, I have never have calculus.&lt;br /&gt;This toothbrush cleans very good, that is why I give 1 star, but it will destroy your gums and bone.&lt;br /&gt;I will recomend much more the Sonicare toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t my first Oral-B toothbrush.  I&#x27;ve been using them for years but this one surpasses all the rest. It&#x27;s got all the bells and whistles that make brushing your teeth fun.  From past esperience I know that it gets your teeth cleaner which helps to equal a better check up at the dentist.  I like the head on this brush better than the the new OralB sonic because I have a small mouth and this head just fits better.  I would definitely reccomen it to anyone wanting a quality toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Recommended by dentists.  And I&#x27;ve had kudos from my own dentist for less plague and damage from brushing too hard.</li>
            <li> In 5 months got problems with charging it. 2 months later battery is dead. Previous brush ended the same, but lasted 1year5months.&lt;br /&gt;So, 2 brush sets, each around $130 went into a trash bin in just 2 years. Thanks a lot, but switching to other brand. Will never ever buy Braun brand.</li>
            <li> This seems superior to other electric toothbrushes but it is not a substitute for flossing.  The battery life is poor and it doesn&#x27;t work on European current (220) so it is not a good choice for travel.</li>
            <li> I am a fan of rechargeable toothbrushes.  The majority of the ones I own have been Oral-B mostly because they have been the least expensive on the market but all of them have been compatible with the brush heads.  Just FYI: The floss action isn&#x27;t as impressive as it sounds.  The cleaning brush does just as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the travel case.  Once fully charged, the toothbrush lasts me for 8 days with twice daily brushing, 2 minutes each session.  So that means you can bring this toothbrush along without fumbling with the charging station.  The timer keeps track of how long you need to brush each quadrant of your mouth (30 seconds for each quadrant in daily clean mode).  It has an indicator to let you know when you&#x27;re brushing too hard.  If you have problem with receding gums, this indicator comes in handy.  The timer doubles as a clock too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush head holder will hold 4 brush heads.  This means you can have different types of brush heads for your own use OR one for each family member so really you only need 1 toothbrush and 4 brush heads.  If you&#x27;re new to rechargeable toothbrushes, the vibrations take some getting used to, but you get one heck of a clean!!!</li>
            <li> Our family has been using Oral B electric toothbrushes for years. This model, the Smart Series 5000 HEALTH CLEAN + FLOSS ACTION model has some improvements over the older models which some of us were still using, so I could compare them side by side. This review was also updated on 9/07/12 after comparing it to the Oral-B Smartseries 5000 Professional Care model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, the sensor tells if you are exerting too much pressure on the teeth - this is to help prevent enamel abrasion. This sensor also tells you which quadrant to brush and shows when you are done with that quadrant should you be forgetful (such as when you are groggy in the morning).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a new design to the stand which keeps it plugged into the charger. If you want to not use electricity all the time unplug it from your electrical outlet. This stand holds other brush heads if other family members are sharing the unit with you. This new shape to the stand is stable and won&#x27;t tip over, it is more stable than older model&#x27;s recharging stands which were smaller and just wider than the toothbrush. I note the charger on THIS UNIT is NOT compatible for use in Europe. (This is a new charger design than the former 5000 series model had, that one could be used in Europe.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This model comes with the FLOSS ACTION head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once you own this unit and read the owner manual you realize the unit can be further customized to your personal liking by buying a different replacement head. They sell 6 different brush heads in all, one is for sensitive teeth which is new. The mode for floss action requires the use of the floss action head which is what comes with this model. They market this same basic device called  Oral-B Smartseries 5000 Professional Care Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush that has the precision cleaning brush head. This whole thing confused me at first, so I will repeat: the units are the same and they both have different cleaning modes but for each thing you need a different head, each are purchased separately. Therefore, although the unit has different modes, you can&#x27;t use more than one unless you buy more than one brush head type.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honestly, I didn&#x27;t notice a difference in how my teeth felt using the brush heads. I wish I could report that I could detect a difference. The floss action has some flat plastic pieces instead of being all brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a new travel case which we appreciate since we do travel with our electric toothbrushes. The case not only keeps the brush heads from being crushed but it protects the actual device. It holds the unit and additional brush heads.ifferent head, each are purchased separately.

            <li> I&#x27;ve been using electronic toothbrushes for about 15 years now, and at this point, I don&#x27;t see myself ever stopping. I started off with a Sonicare, and then switched to an Oral B. After about 10 years of using my Oral B, I decided it was time to invest in some newer technology.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This new model is fantastic. Every 30 seconds, it gives a little extra buzz to let you know to move to a different quadrant of your mouth. That is extremely useful because it is very easy to spend more time on one part of your mouth than another. After two minutes, it gives a few extra buzzes so you know you&#x27;re done. It can be very tempting to skimp out on the amount of time dedicated to brushing, especially when rushing in the morning, but this system helps fight those temptations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as quality of brushing, this is exactly what I expected from Oral B. I feel refreshed every time I finish using it, and never EVER get cavities. Also, the toothbrush seems to stay very clean, provided you remove the brush and rinse it after each session.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this toothbrush to anyone who cares about their teeth and gums and doesn&#x27;t mind the tingly vibrations (which I promise you get used to quickly).</li>
            <li> This gift was bought for my sister who brushes her teeth too hard. This toothbrush has a sensor on it to tell her that she is brushing her teeth too hard. It should help her keep her teeth longer.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush would not fully charge...even after 24 hours...  After finally charging, I was already skeptical but wanted to give the Oral-B a chance at working as good as my Sonicare...  I turned the toothbrush on using the timer setting.. The toothbrush beeped as indicated but after 2 minutes, now the toothbrush won&#x27;t turn off.. just continues to run until I physically turn off.  I did contact Oral B after my first disappointing use and they told me to turn the toothrbush in for repair.. AFTER ONE USE, I am suppose to ship it back to Oral B for them to repair..  Pretty lame... I asked to have a return call from one of the service technicians... STILL WAITING and its been over a week.  I can tell you there is absolutely NO CUSTOMER SERVICE AT Oral B.  I have emailed twice and there main concern it seems is to get my birthdate before I can proceed with my question...  THANKFULLY AMAZON HAS SUPER customer service and I am returning this toothbrush to them...</li>
            <li> At first I thought that this toothbrush, with its separate timer/clock was a little gimmicky, but after using it for several weeks, I&#x27;m very pleased with it. The diagram on the timer really does make me aware of each quadrant of my mouth, so I brush more effectively than I used to. I also like being able to dial down to a \\&quot;soft\\&quot; setting occasionally. The only downside is that the brush on its stand plus the timer take up more space on the sink than my old brush.</li>
            <li> I bought the Oral-B Professional 5000 toothbrush a few years ago.  Since then I bought my sister one and I just bought my boyfriend one too!  It gives me a feeling of clean that a manual toothbrush just doesn&#x27;t.  I would recommend this toothbrush with confidence. Once you get it... you won&#x27;t know how you managed brushing your teeth without it.  The only thing it doesn&#x27;t clean is between teeth, so don&#x27;t forget to floss!</li>
            <li> I had to replace my old oral b electric toothbrush after 15 years.  What a difference in cleaning ability!  My teeth feel great - as clean as a dental cleaning!I would recommend this to anyone wanting better oral hygiene. I only hope this one lasts as long as the old one.</li>
            <li> This product leaves your teeth feeling wonderful.  It doesn&#x27;t take any effort with the setup and I like the wireless timer.  I would highly recommend this product! Worth the price!</li>
            <li> I am enjoying this Oral B. I now know that I made the right choice buying it. I before applied more pressure destroying my gums but now I am much pleased. Go for it there is nothing to lose.</li>
            <li> I never had this kind of toothbrush before and I must say i am very satisfied with Oral B. This toothbrush cleans deeper than a regular toothbrush. I am very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> Unbelievably this good toothbrush comes with a 110-130 power supply.  It is made in Germany and it won&#x27;t even work there!!!  Amazing German engineering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My previous Oral-B came with a 110-240 power supply.  Based on the images here I thought that even if this one didn&#x27;t come with a 110-240 v adapter (based on previous reviews), I could use my existing adapter when I travel.  Nope.  New toothbrush fits in the other one but does not charge.  New one has a hole that sits on a spike (missing in the original one) in the new adapter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess Eastern engineering is now better than that found in Merkel country.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What idiots at Braun.</li>
            <li> Of all the electric toothbrushes we have purchased this one is the best. There is a case to cover the brushes, a timer that informs you how long to brush each quadrant and the cleaning experience is really nice.</li>
            <li> 8 months ago I received the Braun SmartSeries 5000 as part of a cleaning treatment from my Dentist (so I paid for it indirectly).  This is my second Braun electric toothbrush (the first was not this model but a cheaper model I bought about 6 years ago) and I experienced the same problem with both.  After about 6-8 months they stopped working because water penetrated the casing and shorted the electronics.  I also own a Sonicare toothbrush that I bought when my first Braun died (so it&#x27;s over 5 years old) and I have never had an issue with it.  Maybe I have been unlucky, but as good as Braun&#x27;s are, I think they have a design problem.</li>
            <li> Purchased this after using a Sonic toothbrush for several years.  This cleans much better and I like the brush options that you can purchase.</li>
            <li> I like the way it works......EXCEPT you can&#x27;t change brushing modes without starting up the timer.  Also the toothpaste must already be on the brush.  It could fly all over the place while changeing modes.  Not Good.  BUT!!! Very good brushing action.</li>
            <li> Dentist recommended the 4000 or 5000. It is very efficient. I noticed less plaque after first use! My gums did not bleed and even of they had there is a choice of 5 settings so you can begin on gentler cycle if necessary. I LOVE the smiley remote timer too. Keeps you honest</li>
            <li> This does a great job, and my mouth feels clean and wonderful when I&#x27;ve finished.  I do use the SmartGuide so that I know when to move to the next quadrant of my mouth, although at times I&#x27;ve brushed considerably longer than the preset 2- or 3-minute programs.  I actually use this in conjunction with a WaterPik flosser, which always loosens a few particles that the Oral-B has left behind.  I&#x27;m not quite sure why the brush head that was included in the package was the Floss-Action head, rather than the standard ProWhite head..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, I would recommend this brush to anyone who wants to attain a clean, healthy mouth.</li>
            <li> This is the best electric toothbrush i have had so far. It is just fantastic the family loves it two&lt;br /&gt;Lyn</li>
            <li> Who knew I&#x27;d be so excited about a toothbrush?  I love it.  My teeth feel so clean and I look forward to using it as often as I can.  The little digital display is a bit childish and gimmicky, but I&#x27;ve found that I use it/look at it every day.  Sometimes, especially in the mornings, when it feels like I&#x27;ve been brushing for forever, I look at the display and realize it&#x27;s only been 40 seconds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Granted, I don&#x27;t have much to compare it to besides the old-fashioned, archaic, manual toothbrush, but I&#x27;m very satisfied and so far feel that it is definitely worth the price!</li>
            <li> This toothbrush replaced an older model that was dropped and stopped working. Upon delivery of the new item I noticed that the Smart Guide LED display/clock was missing. I contacted Oral B and they promptly sent me a new Smart Guide which I was unable to sync with the toothbrush handle. I contacted Oral B again and they sent another Smart Guide it too does not sync with the toothbrush handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So in brief, a great product but a disappointment as I&#x27;m not enjoying the full experience.</li>
            <li> The new model beeps every 30 seconds, which makes the display part unnecessary. It would be nice to be able to buy the device without the display for less. Other than that, birds sing, plants grow, babies smile when you use this toothbrush. Well maybe not, but regular brushing with it reduces the plaque mining at the dentists office, which makes that experience a lot better.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really nice - keeps me brushing and brushing correctly. My dentist said that it&#x27;s noticeable that I brush daily now. Just get one and use it for life, your teeth and general health will thank you. You will need to floss less too.</li>
