            <li>My dentist impressed at my last appointment!</li>
            <li>Good reasonable toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>This is a nice toothbrush and fun to use.</li>
            <li>It works just fine.</li>
            <li>Works fine and gets the job done.</li>
            <li>I was expecting a cheap and flimsy product</li>
            <li>So far so good..</li>
            <li>My dentist and dental hygienist always comments on how clean my teeth are.</li>
            <li>am amazed at how clean each and every tooth feels every time i use it.</li>
            <li>This toothbrush may have been good - made my teeth feel clean, but the switch to turn it on and off broke on the third day.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s as good as it is, especially considering the price.  </li>
            <li>The first time I bought this product, it was available at Walmart.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth $13.</li>
            <li>Really great little toothbrush, and my first electric one.  </li>
            <li>I have a more expensive mechanical toothbrush &amp; thought if I can get the same cleaning with a cheap one -great!</li>
            <li>GREAT PRODUCT AT AN UNBELIEVABLE PRICE.</li>
            <li>I like the product very much</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a lot better than other leading brands easily available.  </li>
            <li>One of them died the first week</li>
            <li>at first.</li>
            <li>Sorry can&#x27;t buy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;June 2015 - Just started using this and its a wonderful toothbrush.</li>
            <li>plus two more of the same brushes that is on it.</li>
            <li>The on-off switch was easy to push, and the brush was more delicate.  </li>
            <li>It works well, doesn&#x27;t eat up the batteries so fast and is simple and easy to use.</li>
            <li>No matter how diligently I&#x27;ve hand-brushed in the past, I&#x27;ve never been able to get teeth as clean as this one does in a couple of minutes.</li>
            <li>I really like it battery</li>
            <li>I replaced the first one after more than a year when the brushes wore down.</li>
            <li>It worked well and my teeth never got that clean with a regular toothbrush.</li>
            <li>but, it would seem a shame to be thrown away when brush wears down and the rest is ok.</li>
            <li>I have seen many different styles and all seem to work about the same.</li>
            <li>Hopefully, the more expensive one I ordered will be much better~</li>
            <li>the other is working ok so far</li>
            <li>By the time I needed another one, I could not find it in any store I normally go.  </li>
            <li>I just can&#x27;t afford to buy a new electric toothbrush once or twice a month.</li>
            <li>nothing worked.&lt;br /&gt;While it was inexpensive, and worked well, I don&#x27;t to have to buy a new toothbrush every time</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;it needs new batteries.</li>
            <li>After my old toothbrush could no longer be revived even with new batteries, I was unsure of which one to to with.  </li>
            <li>WOW</li>
            <li>This one is perfect--even though I am 75 years old.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it to someone who has been using a regular brush and who, like me, was told by a hygienist to get an oscillating brush.</li>
            <li>It reaches my back teeth and makes cleaning the back part of my teeth much easier to do.</li>
            <li>Am perplexed at the negative ratings; I&#x27;ve had absolutely no problems, and it works really well...especially for $4.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed that I do have a lot less plaque buildup which is exactly why I wanted a power toothbrush.  </li>

            <li> This little brush is quiet and the brush head is small enough so that it&#x27;s easy to move in and around my dogs mouth and get her back teeth.</li>
            <li> last a long time too.</li>
            <li> the battery lasts a long time; I actually bought this to brush my dog&#x27;s teeth</li>
            <li> My Brush Point stopped working, and replacing batteries multiple times did not help it.&lt;br /&gt;I used brand new batteries and active batteries from other devices, but</li>
            <li> The only reason I did not give it a 5-star rating is because I don&#x27;t have experience with other electric brushes (except the Rotadent) for comparison.</li>
            <li> Its very heavy and loud.</li>
            <li> for half of what this toothbrush will come to your house for you get the same thing in a package with 2 extra round replacement brushes.  </li>
            <li> Does some work but not real cleaning at all...</li>
            <li> First set of batteries failed in two days.....</li>
            <li> This electric brush, like other much more expensive electric brushes, does not have a 360-degree rotating brush like the Rotadent, but rather has a brush that rotates approximately 180 degrees and then reverses.</li>
            <li> Hardworking little machine</li>
            <li> that caused me quite a little bit of confusion.</li>
            <li> there&#x27;s no way I understood this product to be just one little brush for 10 bucks.&lt;br /&gt;other</li>
            <li> Order was sent promptly and is holding up well to everyday use.  </li>
            <li> I prefer this small compact head that this one has.</li>
            <li> Not sure what has changed in the product for the price increase.</li>
            <li> second failed in three...</li>
            <li> Not very good.</li>
            <li> was hard to reach.</li>
            <li> At least it was inder $5!</li>
            <li> This was the least expensive, and, although it doesn&#x27;t come with a lot of extras, it is just what I need.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it stopped working after a month.</li>
            <li> so I didn&#x27;t want to spend a lot of money on something that my dog would be afraid of and not let me use on her teeth.</li>
            <li> So disappointed.</li>

            <li> Good reasonable toothbrush.  I will purchase again.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush works just as good as the name brand I really like it battery last a long time too.</li>
            <li> I like the product very much I haven&#x27;t tried anymore but, I liked the size and that it was able to reach my teeth were a regular toothbrush was hard to reach.</li>
            <li> My kids love the tooth brushes.  They have been making excuses to brush their teeth.  Our dentist will love it too.</li>
            <li> Came brand new and in perfect working condition.  Order was sent promptly and is holding up well to everyday use.  Battery life exceptional.  Hardworking little machine</li>
            <li> These things have no longevity!  I&#x27;m on my third one and they all died within a month!!!!  One of them died the first week (yes I changed the batteries).  For that reason, I&#x27;d definitely NOT recommend this.  But when they do work, they work well.  I just can&#x27;t afford to buy a new electric toothbrush once or twice a month.</li>
            <li> I loved using this brush...but the battery dies within a month.</li>
            <li> Really great little toothbrush, and my first electric one.  Am perplexed at the negative ratings; I&#x27;ve had absolutely no problems, and it works really well...especially for $4.  No matter how diligently I&#x27;ve hand-brushed in the past, I&#x27;ve never been able to get teeth as clean as this one does in a couple of minutes.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t go without, and don&#x27;t leave home without one!  My dentist and dental hygienist always comments on how clean my teeth are.</li>
            <li> Great price for an electric toothbrush that works and the battery lasts a long time; I actually bought this to brush my dog&#x27;s teeth so I didn&#x27;t want to spend a lot of money on something that my dog would be afraid of and not let me use on her teeth. This little brush is quiet and the brush head is small enough so that it&#x27;s easy to move in and around my dogs mouth and get her back teeth. It does the job well, My dog even comes running now when she hears me getting it out of the drawer.</li>
            <li> I use it from September before year and toothbrush work without replace battery, This is very good! Thank you all about it!</li>

            <li> any of these seem about the same to me. I have seen many different styles and all seem to work about the same.</li>
            <li> This is a nice toothbrush and fun to use. I&#x27;ve noticed that I do have a lot less plaque buildup which is exactly why I wanted a power toothbrush.  I prefer this small compact head that this one has. I had another with longer bristles that I didn&#x27;t care for. The replacement heads are interchangeable with another brand of power toothbrush that my daughter has which is nice.</li>
            <li> It works just fine. No issues to date.</li>
            <li> Its very heavy and loud. I dont recommend this item no matter the price unless you plan on cleaning the floor with it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m extremely happy with this toothbrush.  It does a good job.</li>
            <li> The first time I bought this product, it was available at Walmart.  It&#x27;s a lot better than other leading brands easily available.

            <li> I really liked it....at first. It worked well and my teeth never got that clean with a regular toothbrush. Unfortunately it stopped working after a month. So disappointed. I won&#x27;t buy this brush again.</li>
            <li> I bought this toothbrush soley on its price. I have a more expensive mechanical toothbrush &amp; thought if I can get the same cleaning with a cheap one -great! This brush has a BIg \\&quot;bump\\&quot; opposite the brush that runs into your cheek or onto you opposite gum line when brushing. ouch!!  I am worried it is going to chip a tooth! so into the garbage it goes after one short brushing. At least it was inder $5! Off to buy another brand...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Learn from my errror - dont go with a cheap mechanical toothbrush!</li>
            <li> Nice toothebrush.  Works great and great price.  I was expecting a cheap and flimsy product but it is definity not.</li>
            <li> April 2016 - The price has increased like 400%. I bought it at $ 3.99. Not sure what has changed in the product for the price increase. Decreasing my review from 5 star to 3. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth $13. Sorry can&#x27;t buy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;June 2015 - Just started using this and its a wonderful toothbrush. i have never seen my teeth so white and sparkling before. My wife also likes this. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> I bought one some time ago to keep in my suitcase.  My husband likes his.  The rest are for Christmas gifts.  Maybe everyone else will like theirs as well.</li>
            <li> Ordered 2, one stopped working within a week...the other is working ok so far</li>
            <li> First set of batteries failed in two days.....second failed in three...the brush head is the size of a pea don&#x27;t buy!</li>
            <li> Not as good as the oral b.  It comes from China.  That scares me since i put it in my mouth.</li>
            <li> Great price, still working great after a month, battery was already inside the product.. So far so good.. For the price</li>
            <li> THIS BRUSHPOINT TOOTHBRUSH WORKS AS GOOD AS THE $150.00 ONES. GREAT PRODUCT AT AN UNBELIEVABLE PRICE. IT SAYS 2 MORE WORDS REQUIRED SO I HAD TO ADD THIS.&lt;br /&gt;JOHN L</li>
            <li> Does some work but not real cleaning at all...</li>
            <li> This toothbrush may have been good - made my teeth feel clean, but the switch to turn it on and off broke on the third day.  You get what you pay for!</li>
            <li> am amazed at how clean each and every tooth feels every time i use it. and it gets between my teeth just like floss. WOW</li>
            <li> I took one star off this product because of the price.  you may not even realize you are getting the same toothbrush as you can get for Walmart for one third of this.  that caused me quite a little bit of confusion. for half of what this toothbrush will come to your house for you get the same thing in a package with 2 extra round replacement brushes.  plus two more of the same brushes that is on it. plus the dental floss attachments several of those.  + 3 extra tips for irrigating and stimulating the gum.  there&#x27;s no way I understood this product to be just one little brush for 10 bucks.&lt;br /&gt;other than that it works great lol</li>
            <li> for the price of a regular toothbrush, cant be beat..  great brush.  I do question about purchasing replacement brush, not because of price of the purchase but, it would seem a shame to be thrown away when brush wears down and the rest is ok.</li>
            <li> Not very good. Maybe it&#x27;s for babies/children. Day three and the batteries have died. Changed the batteries and it&#x27;s still not working properly... Hopefully, the more expensive one I ordered will be much better~</li>
            <li> For the price... you can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
            <li> After my old toothbrush could no longer be revived even with new batteries, I was unsure of which one to to with.  I really like this because I apparently have a small mouth as th dentist has me use children&#x27;s toothbrushes.  This one is perfect--even though I am 75 years old.</li>
            <li> I researched several oscillating brushes.This was the least expensive, and, although it doesn&#x27;t come with a lot of extras, it is just what I need. It reaches my back teeth and makes cleaning the back part of my teeth much easier to do. I highly recommend it to someone who has been using a regular brush and who, like me, was told by a hygienist to get an oscillating brush.</li>
            <li> Looks just as it is. Works fine and gets the job done.</li>
            <li> I have used this  product for several years now. This is my third one. I replaced the first one after more than a year when the brushes wore down. The second one lasted over a year before the switch started giving me problems. The cost is so low that replacing it is of no consequence. The brush size is virtually the same as that of the dentist recommended Rotadent, which costs over $100 and of which replacement brushes cost over $10 each. This electric brush, like other much more expensive electric brushes, does not have a 360-degree rotating brush like the Rotadent, but rather has a brush that rotates approximately 180 degrees and then reverses. I believe the reason is that the  Rotadent may have a patent on 360-degree rotating brushes. I recommend this brush and will continue to use it in the future. The only reason I did not give it a 5-star rating is because I don&#x27;t have experience with other electric brushes (except the Rotadent) for comparison.</li>
            <li> The best way to clean your teeth without paying an arm and a leg! My dentist impressed at my last appointment!</li>
