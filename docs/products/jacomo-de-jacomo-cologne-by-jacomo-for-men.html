            <li>I have been buying it for my husband for years and never have I found another that I like better.  </li>
            <li>and I make sure there is no lapse in having it for him.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

            <li>Same juice as I remember from way back......which is excellent!</li>
            <li>I started wearing this over the top Jacamo in 1983...</li>
            <li>So , I thought,  ok, I go on vacation for a month on june 17, and I should get the cologne by june 12.  </li>
            <li>Still better than most newer fragrances available.</li>
            <li>I was very pleased with my product and with the cost and the delivery very reasonable.</li>
            <li>Not too strong...</li>
            <li>if you know colognes this is a great spicy elegant iTs a strong smelling cologne for a long time</li>
            <li>Price is fine for the quality&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes</li>
            <li>It does not smells cheap and is not associated with drugstore scents.</li>
            <li>I still enjoy wearing it.</li>
            <li>I was very excited to find the product at a very reasonable price on Amazon.com.</li>
            <li>I really like Gray Flannel, Fahrenheit, Gucci for Men, Gautier, etc, but Jacomo remains at the top of my list.</li>
            <li>But for Jacomo de Jacomo it is just too much like a tire store for me and undoubtedly you will probably like it better.</li>
            <li>Fine fine classic! ðŸ˜€</li>
            <li>At this price it&#x27;s well worth trying and be amazed how many positive comments you&#x27;ll receive all day...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just like any classic but extremely more affordable now then in the 80&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>Classic jacomo i love it for the price</li>
            <li>This stuff is the real deal so it is full strength and smells like the original formula.  </li>
            <li>Fresh smelling.</li>
            <li>I also love the bottle it comes in, it looks classy.</li>
            <li>just right.</li>
            <li>Price is right.  </li>
            <li>Guarantee you better half will love it.</li>
            <li>This is my current favorite cologne right now.</li>
            <li>Great as usual very please.</li>
            <li>Been wearing Jacomo since first running into it at Epcot, 1984.</li>
            <li>But most won&#x27;t have to because they are probably buying it on Amazon because they&#x27;ve used it some time over the last 30 years and are rediscovering it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>While this doesn&#x27;t kick me into an allergic attack, I much prefer the petrol, vanilla, smoke, tea, leather smell of Bulgari Black, also sold at a good price here on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I see it pretty much as a liquid smoke type of cologne which is very powerful masculine cologne.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really say - everyone is different and EDT/EDPs work better for some people on their skin than on others.</li>
            <li>thanks so much!</li>
            <li>It is a cologne that will have a woman lay her head on your shoulder and talk sweet words to you as she breathes in your masculine eau de toilette.  </li>
            <li>Certain rubber and plastic smells make me sneeze and eyes</li>
            <li>I used to use Jacomo  many years ago, I though it no longer made until I found it in a store, so order it through Amazon, less expensive , I love the spicy smell , good after shave and evening out.</li>
            <li>It is very distinctive and I find that I get a lot of comments and questions about it.</li>
            <li>and it was very expensive...more than $70 for a 3.4oz.</li>
            <li>I have recommended it to all my friends and they also really like it.</li>
            <li>and although I&#x27;m very dubious about buying from places that buy in bulk (they buy up lots of stuff that doesn&#x27;t sell retail and they&#x27;re passed off to discounters.)  </li>
            <li>While most of the reviews expressed cigar like, old furniture like fragrance I couldnt relate to the same</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s no longer available at macys or at any major department stores as far as I</li>
            <li>I have also heard there is a new one out called intense.</li>
            <li>Not much to say other than they are made with good quality.</li>
            <li>Stays for about 4-5 hours noticeably and gives out distinct spurts even later.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t tell you how thrilled I was to discover that J-de-J had risen from the dead!!</li>
            <li>Is a very Masculine fragance with a sence of Tobacco and Musk</li>
            <li>Jacomo was my only cologne for many years, but it suddenly disappeared and I had to find something different</li>
            <li>and it never gets old!  </li>
            <li>Definitely NOT a summer perfume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this perfume as it says &#x27;I am different&#x27; and its not loud yet gets attention.</li>
            <li>The scent is indescribable other than not fruity, sweet, floral, or musky...</li>
            <li>My present boyfriend absolutely loves it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s masculine but not overpowering.</li>
            <li>I was very pleasantly surprised to find this stuff at Amazon</li>
            <li>sexy yet subtle.</li>
            <li>Smells like a hot, wet ashtray.</li>

            <li> sexy yet subtle.</li>
            <li> Smells like a hot, wet ashtray.</li>
            <li> I first bought this cologne in macys at least 30 years ago for a boyfriend i had at the time.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I chatted with a supervisor, and he kept making excuses and making it seem as though it was my fault that I ordered the cologne and expected it in such a short  period of time.</li>
            <li> actually had a sample of it with a lot of other samples and forgot I had.</li>
            <li> Not fruity or perfume-y, as other colognes......</li>
            <li> Look up this on basenotes.net and you&#x27;ll see terms like smokey, leathery, dark, rubbery.</li>
            <li> I like Bulgari Black</li>
            <li> Has hidden notes that emerge the longer you wear it.</li>
            <li> Subtle, not loud.  </li>
            <li> She wrote down the name and said she was going to get some for her man!</li>
            <li> I wear it everyday.</li>
            <li> and it came in just a few days.  </li>
            <li> Today is june 14, and amazon states that they are not sure when its gonna ship, because its not in stock( although the ad still states \\&quot; in stock \\&quot;).</li>
            <li> I only wear another type of cologne for every day which is extremely expensive.</li>
            <li> This cologne has been around since the 70&#x27;s and gets harder and harder to find - almost want to give bad rating</li>
            <li> Hard to go wrong at this price, unless you don&#x27;t care for it once you try it.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> but they have things on a hit or miss basis and they are very expensive.  </li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t think you will be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Horrible customer service Amazon!!!!!!!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is an oldie and a goodie from the 70s and still my favorite fragrance.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best smelling men&#x27;s cologne there ever was.  So glad I can still purchase it on Amazon since they stopped making it!!!</li>
            <li> recommend excellent product</li>
            <li> I used to wear this fragrance back in Brazil when I as a Teenager.I was so glad when I found here at Amazon.Is a very Masculine fragance with a sence of Tobacco and Musk like I said Masculine,and the price: amazing.</li>
            <li> Not much to say other than they are made with good quality. Price is fine for the quality&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes I would recommend to a friend.</li>
            <li> Great smell been using it for over 20 years and have many compliments. This scent agrees with my body oils</li>
            <li> There are many fragrances out there for men, and many are very good. But Jacomo has been my favorite for many years! It is very distinctive and I find that I get a lot of comments and questions about it. One day I had just put it on and stepped out of my house. A woman stopped me and asked what cologne I was wearing! She wrote down the name and said she was going to get some for her man! Now, come on fellas, isn&#x27;t that the kind of response you want to get? I really like Gray Flannel, Fahrenheit, Gucci for Men, Gautier, etc, but Jacomo remains at the top of my list.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with my product and with the cost and the delivery very reasonable.</li>
            <li> This is my current favorite cologne right now. I see it pretty much as a liquid smoke type of cologne which is very powerful masculine cologne. It does not smells cheap and is not associated with drugstore scents. It is a must try if you like powerhouse scents like Fahrenheit and Quorum.</li>
            <li> This is pretty good , one of the best perfume ever, the smelling of this is excellent, i love it</li>
            <li> Jacomo was my only cologne for many years, but it suddenly disappeared and I had to find something different (I switched to CK&#x27;s &#x27;Escape&#x27;). I can&#x27;t tell you how thrilled I was to discover that J-de-J had risen from the dead!! And it&#x27;s just as I remembered! It works equally well as a \\&quot;date-night\\&quot; or an \\&quot;everyday\\&quot; cologne... sexy yet subtle. Hopefully it&#x27;s back to stay because I&#x27;m hooked on it again!!</li>
            <li> I first bought this cologne in macys at least 30 years ago for a boyfriend i had at the time.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s no longer available at macys or at any major department stores as far as I know.&lt;br /&gt;I was so pleased to find it on Amazon.  My present boyfriend absolutely loves it.&lt;br /&gt;You will too.  Try it.  You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Great as usual very please.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for many years and can say i love it. Not too strong...just right. I wear it everyday.</li>
            <li> Been wearing Jacomo since first running into it at Epcot, 1984. Can&#x27;t tell you how many compliment I&#x27;ve received. I still enjoy wearing it. Fresh smelling. Can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff and women do too! i get tons of compliments when wearing it. So glad I found it here!</li>
            <li> I used to use Jacomo  many years ago, I though it no longer made until I found it in a store, so order it through Amazon, less expensive , I love the spicy smell , good after shave and evening out.</li>
            <li> if you know colognes this is a great spicy elegant iTs a strong smelling cologne for a long time</li>
            <li> I love this Jacoma De Jacomo!!  I have been buying it for my husband for years and never have I found another that I like better.  He always tells me when he is almost out and I make sure there is no lapse in having it for him.&lt;br /&gt;I know everyone doesn&#x27;t care for the same product but for my husband--this is the one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for over 20 years. It&#x27;s masculine but not overpowering. It&#x27;s has a spicy scent.</li>
            <li> I used to wear Jocomo de Jocomo thirty years ago when I was a teenager in Boston and West Central Florida...can&#x27;t wait to smell it again, I expect the memories to come flooding back...I was very excited to find the product at a very reasonable price on Amazon.com. I have seen it one time in 30 years in a cologne shop in Vegas and it was very expensive...more than $70 for a 3.4oz. Can&#x27;t wait for my order to arrive!</li>
            <li> My husband has been using Jacomo De Jacomo for many years. Everytime he wears it he gets compliments on it. I love it and how it smells on him. I hope they never stop making it. I have recommended it to all my friends and they also really like it. Try it and I don&#x27;t think you will be disappointed. I also love the bottle it comes in, it looks classy.</li>
            <li> My favorite scent since 1984 ..... Everyone likes the smell</li>
            <li> Aah the funky smell of the 70&#x27;s.... Love it.</li>
            <li> Same juice as I remember from way back......which is excellent! Lasts all day and not in your face. Great for the office or just hanging out.</li>
            <li> I started wearing this over the top Jacamo in 1983...college days. Recently found it here on Amazon.. It&#x27;s just like any classic but extremely more affordable now then in the 80&#x27;s.I used to pay 80.00 for the 4 Oz. Spray in 1983, which was normally an exceptional twice a year treat... The scent is indescribable other than not fruity, sweet, floral, or musky... It stays with you all day unlike some of the now $100.00 + colognes.. At this price it&#x27;s well worth trying and be amazed how many positive comments you&#x27;ll receive all day... BTW it&#x27;s in no way overpowering... Fine fine classic! ðŸ˜€</li>
            <li> Classic jacomo i love it for the price</li>
            <li> It is a cologne that will have a woman lay her head on your shoulder and talk sweet words to you as she breathes in your masculine eau de toilette.  Guarantee you better half will love it.</li>
            <li> This cologne has been around since the 70&#x27;s and gets harder and harder to find - almost want to give bad rating so I constantly have a stash.</li>
            <li> SE LO OBESEQUIE A UN BUEN AMIGO PARA LAS NAVIDADES Y LE ENCANTO TANTO QUE SE LO TERMINO RAPIDAMENTE ME DIJO QUE NUNCA HABIA SENTIDO UNA FRAGANCIA TAN DELICIOSA</li>
            <li> When I placed my order on june 7, the ad stated , \\&quot; in stock 1 to 2 days extra to ship \\&quot;, and I have amazon prime. So , I thought,  ok, I go on vacation for a month on june 17, and I should get the cologne by june 12.  Today is june 14, and amazon states that they are not sure when its gonna ship, because its not in stock( although the ad still states \\&quot; in stock \\&quot;). I chatted with a supervisor, and he kept making excuses and making it seem as though it was my fault that I ordered the cologne and expected it in such a short  period of time. I will go look for it in the store, and in the future, will order from a different website. Horrible customer service Amazon!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Look up this on basenotes.net and you&#x27;ll see terms like smokey, leathery, dark, rubbery. But most won&#x27;t have to because they are probably buying it on Amazon because they&#x27;ve used it some time over the last 30 years and are rediscovering it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I actually had a sample of it with a lot of other samples and forgot I had. When I saw how inexpensive it was for 3.4 oz on Amazon, I grabbed it. Hard to go wrong at this price, unless you don&#x27;t care for it once you try it. Since that is what I found, I&#x27;d suggest that if you haven&#x27;t tried it before and you can find a place selling Jacomo products, try it first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My problem with this well-regarded EDT is that I have the same problem with it that I do when I walk in an automotive tire store - that type of rubber is over-powering to me and I don&#x27;t like it. Certain rubber and plastic smells make me sneeze and eyes water. While this doesn&#x27;t kick me into an allergic attack, I much prefer the petrol, vanilla, smoke, tea, leather smell of Bulgari Black, also sold at a good price here on Amazon. It is more expensive than Jacomo being a bit above $30 for 2.5 oz while Jacomo is about $20 or so for 3.4 oz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why I like Bulgari Black and it doesn&#x27;t bother me like Jacomo de Jacomo I can&#x27;t really say - everyone is different and EDT/EDPs work better for some people on their skin than on others. But for Jacomo de Jacomo it is just too much like a tire store for me and undoubtedly you will probably like it better.</li>
            <li> as described.  thank you.</li>
            <li> I have been wearing this stuff &amp;#34;off-and-on&amp;#34; for years.  I like it because to me it smells like a nicer version of &amp;#34;Old Spice.&amp;#34;  I have been getting it locally from a store that imports a lot of things from Europe but they have things on a hit or miss basis and they are very expensive.  I was very pleasantly surprised to find this stuff at Amazon and although I&#x27;m very dubious about buying from places that buy in bulk (they buy up lots of stuff that doesn&#x27;t sell retail and they&#x27;re passed off to discounters.)  This stuff is the real deal so it is full strength and smells like the original formula.  I only wear another type of cologne for every day which is extremely expensive.</li>
            <li> I purchase this as a gift and it came in just a few days.  I was very pleased with the timely arrival and the recipient of the gift was very happy to have it.  It smells great, too!</li>
            <li> Great fragrance. I have also bought 1 million its a great Cologne. I have also heard there is a new one out called intense.</li>
            <li> My lady loves it.  It is truly male.  Subtle, not loud.  Not fruity or perfume-y, as other colognes......Has hidden notes that emerge the longer you wear it.</li>
            <li> This is a very different perfume in my collection and the vast variety i have tried in stores. While most of the reviews expressed cigar like, old furniture like fragrance I couldnt relate to the same (i bought it for those reasons). On my skin it smells sweetish at start and then has a spicy-sweet-musky smell until its gone. Stays for about 4-5 hours noticeably and gives out distinct spurts even later. Definitely NOT a summer perfume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this perfume as it says &#x27;I am different&#x27; and its not loud yet gets attention.</li>
            <li> Smells like a hot, wet ashtray.</li>
            <li> Jacomo De Jacomo By Jacomo For Men. Eau De Toilette Spray 3.4 Ounces is a great value and one of the sexiest smells out there.  loved it for over 30 years!  and it never gets old!  thanks so much!</li>
            <li> Been wearing this fragrance since 1974. Still better than most newer fragrances available. Price is right.  Give it a try.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff good deal</li>
