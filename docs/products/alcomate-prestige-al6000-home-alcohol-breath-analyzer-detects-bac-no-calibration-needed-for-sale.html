            <li>The device is excellent.  </li>
            <li>The Prestige accuracy is wonderful and it gives the BAC of your body.</li>
            <li>Still, for the $, this is a reliable, excellent product that is a great edition to any night out.</li>
            <li>Very easy to use as I have had my kids operate this devise flawlessly.</li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t ask for more!!</li>
            <li>It was good while it lasted</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many differnt breathalyzers and this is my favorite, very comfortable in the hand, and great to use</li>
            <li>Very easy to use and very easy to repair.  </li>
            <li>great product that helps you know when your having too much!</li>
            <li>good product but batteries die quickly~</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much more inexpensive and better quality then many of it&#x27;s rivals</li>
            <li>Easy to use and easy to maintain.</li>
            <li>Easy to hold with accurate results.</li>
            <li>Accurate readings.</li>
            <li>This seems like a reliable and accurate tool to measure your BAC.</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;ll see an accurate reading.</li>
            <li>Originally I was happy with the unit - but based on the above I can not recommend it and will replace it with another brand.</li>
            <li>There are many factors that can affect the results but if you follow the recommended directions and change the sensor as suggested, this baby will provide you with a pretty damn accurate BAC.</li>
            <li>Great little device that works well and is very accurate.</li>
            <li>Good enough for the Navy, good enough for me!!!</li>
            <li>Very cool product, works really fast and super helpful.</li>
            <li>Such cute colors!</li>
            <li>Worth the buy</li>
            <li>You just stick the mouthpiece into the side and then blow right into it.</li>
            <li>The price of it is very reasonable.</li>
            <li>so after testing myself over several years I am pretty familiar with how alcohol is absorbed by my system.  </li>
            <li>I am well aware that you have to wait a while after your last drink for the test to be accurate.  </li>
            <li>A handy little product from people of all walks of life, whether you drink or just need to reign in all of your friends who do.</li>
            <li>(the one downside is this device does not display thousandth and this really would have been valuable).  </li>
            <li>The silver one looks sleek and thin and great.</li>
            <li>I used to own a small portable unit that worked pretty well</li>
            <li>I will say it takes a minute to calibrate each time and sucks through batteries, but a good product.</li>
            <li>but I honestly feel that the readings it gave were never accurate,</li>
            <li>This is a relatively inexpensive device and feels potentially a little more flimsy than AlcoMates other great products.</li>
            <li>Bigger than the other three but also good hand held....</li>
            <li>Completely sober -</li>
            <li>After three months the device completely quit working.  </li>
            <li>The only problem is that the countdown takes to long to get ready for testing.</li>
            <li>however starting at about the 40th use the meter became wildly innacurate.  </li>
            <li>And easy to use may have to blow a little harder and longer</li>

            <li> A handy little product from people of all walks of life, whether you drink or just need to reign in all of your friends who do. This is a relatively inexpensive device and feels potentially a little more flimsy than AlcoMates other great products. It&#x27;s also a little harder to do the breath with and the design isn&#x27;t quite as sleek. Still, for the $, this is a reliable, excellent product that is a great edition to any night out.</li>
            <li> I used to own a small portable unit that worked pretty well so after testing myself over several years I am pretty familiar with how alcohol is absorbed by my system.  I am well aware that you have to wait a while after your last drink for the test to be accurate.  The AlcoMate worked well for the fist couple of months.  I used it as did my friends. There is a limited life to the catalyst (250 or so tests) - however starting at about the 40th use the meter became wildly innacurate.  Three beers in two hours and it read 0.34????  I don&#x27;t think so.  A re-test was 0.24 then 3 minutes later 0.12 - in reality I was probably in the 0.06 range.  Completely sober - I read 0.03.  Originally I was happy with the unit - but based on the above I can not recommend it and will replace it with another brand.</li>
            <li> This is AWESOME. Looks and works official. The price of it is very reasonable. It&#x27;s much more inexpensive and better quality then many of it&#x27;s rivals</li>
            <li> Easy to hold with accurate results.</li>
            <li> great product that helps you know when your having too much!</li>
            <li> After three months the device completely quit working.  What a waste of money.  I would not recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> Such cute colors! Compact but packs a punch. Worth the buy</li>
            <li> This product saves lives, and gets results. Good enough for the Navy, good enough for me!!!</li>
            <li> Edgy design. Accurate readings. Couldn&#x27;t ask for more!!</li>
            <li> Very cool product, works really fast and super helpful.</li>
            <li> Bigger than the other three but also good hand held.... And easy to use may have to blow a little harder and longer</li>
            <li> good product but batteries die quickly~</li>
            <li> This seems like a reliable and accurate tool to measure your BAC. I will say it takes a minute to calibrate each time and sucks through batteries, but a good product.</li>
            <li> I purchased this after I received a DUI back in April of 2013.  It was of course difficult to know if it was accurate but after I was required to install a IID (ignition interlock device) I soon realized it was bang on.  The IID would not allow me to start my car if my BAC was above .025.  I can say that each time I tested myself and was at .02 the IID would allow me to start my car. (the one downside is this device does not display thousandth and this really would have been valuable).  It is critical to know that the sensor must be replaced since it cannot be calibrated. There are many factors that can affect the results but if you follow the recommended directions and change the sensor as suggested, this baby will provide you with a pretty damn accurate BAC.</li>
            <li> Great little device that works well and is very accurate. Very easy to use as I have had my kids operate this devise flawlessly.They take it to friends&#x27; houses and say \\&quot;Blow 0.00 and we will ride with you, if not we will not get in the car with you.\\&quot; Gives them security and me also</li>
            <li> I spent $100 on something I used for a couple months. It was good while it lasted but I honestly feel that the readings it gave were never accurate,</li>
            <li> The silver one looks sleek and thin and great. You just stick the mouthpiece into the side and then blow right into it. Don&#x27;t forget to blow hard enough and it&#x27;ll give you the correct reading.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***Don&#x27;t forget to lick your lips and maybe get some mouthwash and you&#x27;ll see an accurate reading.</li>
            <li> The device is excellent.  Very easy to use and very easy to repair.  The only problem is that the countdown takes to long to get ready for testing.</li>
            <li> I purchased this not because we needed it, we just wanted to let our kids know that we are watching them and they need to be careful.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and easy to maintain.</li>
            <li> The Prestige accuracy is wonderful and it gives the BAC of your body. Also it comes in different colors and I like that.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many differnt breathalyzers and this is my favorite, very comfortable in the hand, and great to use</li>
