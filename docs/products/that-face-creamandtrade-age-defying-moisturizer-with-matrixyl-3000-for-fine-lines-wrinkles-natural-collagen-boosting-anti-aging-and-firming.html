            <li>I am so glad that I came across this brand through Amazon.</li>
            <li>it was alright I have had better</li>

            <li>First I must state that I did receive this product for a discount in exchange for my review, but the opinions that follow are my own.</li>
            <li>This product contains peppermint oil and has a nice, light peppermint scent when I first put it on.</li>
            <li>so when I saw this cream I was excited.  </li>
            <li>Light and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>I also noticed that at the end of the day here was still a clean scent, unlike others that can get funky smelling after 12 hours.</li>
            <li>A little sticky when I first apply it, but then smooth and wonderful!  </li>
            <li>I am able to control how much I want, so I&#x27;m not stuck with the bottle squirting out a bunch of cream I don&#x27;t want.</li>
            <li>With in the first two weeks I could see a fantastic difference.</li>
            <li>Thank you Radiant Health Naturals  for creating such an amazing product.</li>
            <li>but I love how soft it makes my skin feel.</li>

            <li>I really can tell a positive difference in my skin after using it for just a few weeks!</li>
            <li>&amp; I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;d buy it for full price.</li>
            <li>It is too early to tell about any age-defying properties but a few pumps of the lotion really helps with the winter dryness</li>

            <li> I really like this moisturizer. I am using it in some of the coldest weather we get (30s) and it&#x27;s keeping my skin from drying out.  I have been using it around my eyes, on my forehead &amp; cheekbones.  I also don&#x27;t have a lot of wrinkles so I&#x27;m unable to speak to how well it does in that aspect.  I bought this with a promotional code that lowered the cost considerably &amp; I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;d buy it for full price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this moisturizer for over a month now and am very pleased with it.  I find that many anti-aging moisturizers make my skin feel tight and dry.  This one has absorbed well and left my skin feeling soft and moisturized all day.  Gone is the flaky skin I had before I began using it.  I also love the refreshing peppermint oil in it - great way to wake up each day.</li>
            <li> This is nice but didnt know after so many days u was going to charge my card 89.00 I will never do this again</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about a month...it has really made a difference in my skin&#x27;s appearance.  I will reorder when I get close to running out....soon.</li>
            <li> Light and absorbs quickly. A little goes a long way - this will last me a long time.</li>
            <li> It has been the best moisturizer I have ever had.  I really like the way it makes my skin feel and how my makeup goes on.  My makeup also seems to last longer through the day. My sister is now using it too!</li>
            <li> Most moisturizers will clog my pores, but this one doesn&#x27;t seem to.</li>
            <li> Really enjoy using this moisturizer, it leaves my skin moisturized with out any oily residue, and helps my make up goes on so nicely and looks better after using it! I really can tell a positive difference in my skin after using it for just a few weeks! It has a very nice fragrance too, which makes using it even more enjoyable!</li>
            <li> I really like this cream.  I&#x27;ve been researching Matrixyl and it&#x27;s anti-aging affects, so when I saw this cream I was excited.  I&#x27;m already using THAT eye cream and love it, so I immediately ordered this when I saw it and I was not disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, it is not greasy or heavy.  And when you put it on, you immediately feel how soft your skin feels. I like how it absorbs instantly and I really love the airless pump on the bottle.  I am able to control how much I want, so I&#x27;m not stuck with the bottle squirting out a bunch of cream I don&#x27;t want. This way I don&#x27;t waste any.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this cream and THAT Eye Cream.</li>
            <li> Love this moisturizer, have already used two bottles and will buy again. Works wonderful, doesn&#x27;t break you face out or to oily. I use it morning and night. WONDERFUL product!</li>
            <li> Have just been using it for 2 weeks and notice quite a difference</li>
            <li> It smells good, I don&#x27;t see any noticble changes as of yet. Reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  Was very skeptical as to the quality but this is just as if not more amazing than some of my professional products that you cannot buy over the counter.</li>
            <li> I have been using and love THAT Eye Cream, so it only made sense to try the moisturizer too. I have been using it for over 3 weeks now and I love how it makes my skin feel when I put it on. It&#x27;s a great formula that leaves my skin looking and feeling healthy. It is not too drying or too moist like some products I have tried. This product contains peppermint oil and has a nice, light peppermint scent when I first put it on. I also like that this product does not contain parabens and the airless pump makes it so convenient to use.</li>
            <li> Love how this makes my face and neck feel.</li>
            <li> I really like this moisturizer the scent smells so good. I use it at night and daytime. I really like the fact that it has a pump on it. I have only been using it for two weeks but I love how soft it makes my skin feel. I am sure as I continue to use it I will see the age defying aspect. I want to try more products by this company. I would recommend this moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Really nice serum with natural ingredients that hydrate and are good for your skin.</li>
            <li> A little sticky when I first apply it, but then smooth and wonderful!  I really like how soft my face feels, lasts all day too! Thank you for allowing me to try it for free!</li>
            <li> I love this product. Goes on well and not greasy. I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> An amazing Age-Defying moisturizer. With in the first two weeks I could see a fantastic difference. I am so glad that I came across this brand through Amazon. I have recommended it  to my family and friends. My skin look hydrated. I have a natural glow from within. You must try it. Don&#x27;t be alarmed by the price. It is worth it&#x27;s weight in gold. I continue to see this as a holy grail product. Thank you Radiant Health Naturals  for creating such an amazing product.</li>
            <li> it was alright I have had better</li>
            <li> I really like this. It&#x27;s not to heavy or greasy but moisturizes well. I haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to see if it&#x27;s age defying, but we&#x27;ll see.</li>
            <li> First I must state that I did receive this product for a discount in exchange for my review, but the opinions that follow are my own. I have been using this moisturizer for nearly a week now and I just love the clean scent. Many moisturizers are scented and hard to cope with that on your face. I also noticed that at the end of the day here was still a clean scent, unlike others that can get funky smelling after 12 hours. It is too early to tell about any age-defying properties but a few pumps of the lotion really helps with the winter dryness I deal with every season. Oh, I love the pump delivery over the tube and bottles that just pour or squeeze out and you cannot control the amount used. The bottle and packaging are pleasing to the eye and look great on my make-up counter which s a plus. The cover pulls off gently and pushed back on which is a plus over screw caps that are hard to operate with lotion on your fingers. Great design, wonderful product, well worth the money.</li>
            <li> Nice texture, not too thin, nor too thick. Spreads nicely.</li>
            <li> My skin felt softer and looked better after use.  The cream has a good texture and smelled great.</li>
