            <li>They are built even and straight.</li>
            <li>but they cost me almost twice as much.</li>
            <li>Ok I ordered these and when they came in the boxes were completely smashed, and open !!!!</li>
            <li>but with that being said they are not bad for the price...but do not buy them if you plan on getting a specific size because they do not come labeled...</li>
            <li>opening the package and examining the needles, there  is no way they should be used for a tattoo on live skin!</li>
            <li>I have seen other generic needles that are just complete trash, but these were good.</li>
            <li>Particularly the 5RL.</li>
            <li>decent quality gets the job done</li>
            <li>just know that if your ordering them for a specific size you could end up not getting any of them or as many as 15 of the same needle as this is an assorted pack...also every one of them have been sterilized by e.o gas</li>
            <li>Got him a whole new tattoo kit with a case and new tat guns</li>
            <li>100 pieces of mixed assorted disposable tattoo needles was exactly how the producer of the product described it, and it met all my needs and expectations!</li>
            <li>A lot for a little in terms of the price for how many needles you get</li>
            <li>As it should be we use new needles for every customer, cost going into pricing the tattoo.</li>
            <li>New Disposable Tattoo Needles</li>
            <li>As it should be we use new needles for every customer, cost going into pricing the tattoo.</li>
            <li>Perfect for practicing on fake skin and learn the difference between a good needle and a bad one.</li>
            <li>I enjoy laying down some ink with this set of assorted disposable needles.</li>
            <li>Clean packaging as well and bubble wrapped with my other product.</li>
            <li>I buy my needles from here, at times when my first choice happens to be out of needles, for my small tattoo business like mine where its not really worth making your own, which are aggravating.</li>
            <li>I just received this needles last week fast shipping and brand new sterilized needles...</li>
            <li>and every single point was secure and sterilized properly.</li>
            <li>Same quality I get from high end needles without the high end price.  </li>
            <li>Not the best needles to use on doing tattoos, but for just starting they&#x27;re not too bad.</li>
            <li>The 100 Pieces Mixed Assorted Disposable Tattoo Needles T100 came as advertised, shipped fast and had no defects so far</li>
            <li>All my labels were clearly printed, with size and expiration dates.</li>
            <li>Depending on how much tattooing you do, this pack can last a while.</li>
            <li>As far as ordering needles from &amp;#34;Johnson and Johnson,&amp;#34; do not waste your time.</li>
            <li>but i had no issues as far as that goes</li>
            <li>Each one in a sterile package that was completely sealed.  </li>
            <li>No burs so far.</li>
            <li>Poorly made needles most of then arnt straight</li>
            <li>exactly what it said it would be, a very decent assortment for a bulk order, i little of everything, will be ordering again</li>
            <li>I got exactly what was described, 10 of each of the sizes from 3rl to 9rl, and 5rs, 7rs, and 9rs, and 5,7,9 single stack mags</li>
            <li>Overall you cant beat the price for a decent box of needles.</li>
            <li>You cant possibly tattoo a straight line with a crooked needle.</li>
            <li>Nice variety of needles, but not very many single needles (12), other</li>
            <li>A general combination of shader and liners.</li>
            <li>pretty long expiration date so their not old stock.</li>
            <li>Too much solder, grouping askew, etc.</li>
            <li>I have only tried a couple of them so far</li>
            <li>cheap as chips and very few problems, only had to junk ten needles out of one hundred!</li>
            <li>Got my order earlier then expected and it was packaged very well.</li>
            <li>weren&#x27;t even sealed like wtf an then on top of that they dull too quick</li>
            <li>Brand NEW needles running BLACK INK FROM PREVIOUS USES STRAIGHT OUT THE PACKAGE.</li>

            <li> Will be buying  from this company real soon.</li>
            <li> A gift for an artist and they have been working out really well.</li>
            <li> How much can really be said about needles?</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Straight and sharpgreat deal</li>
            <li> I really like the way these disposable tattoo needles work, as do some friends of mine who have used them as well.</li>
            <li> I thought I was ordering the whole tube</li>
            <li> They are built even and straight.</li>
            <li> but they cost me almost twice as much.</li>
            <li> Ok I ordered these and when they came in the boxes were completely smashed, and open !!!!</li>
            <li> but with that being said they are not bad for the price...but do not buy them if you plan on getting a specific size because they do not come labeled...</li>
            <li> opening the package and examining the needles, there  is no way they should be used for a tattoo on live skin!</li>
            <li> I have seen other generic needles that are just complete trash, but these were good.</li>
            <li> Particularly the 5RL.</li>
            <li> decent quality gets the job done</li>
            <li> just know that if your ordering them for a specific size you could end up not getting any of them or as many as 15 of the same needle as this is an assorted pack...also every one of them have been sterilized by e.o gas</li>
            <li> Got him a whole new tattoo kit with a case and new tat guns</li>
            <li> 100 pieces of mixed assorted disposable tattoo needles was exactly how the producer of the product described it, and it met all my needs and expectations!</li>
            <li> A lot for a little in terms of the price for how many needles you get</li>
            <li> As it should be we use new needles for every customer, cost going into pricing the tattoo.</li>
            <li> New Disposable Tattoo Needles</li>
            <li> As it should be we use new needles for every customer, cost going into pricing the tattoo.</li>
            <li> Perfect for practicing on fake skin and learn the difference between a good needle and a bad one.</li>
            <li> I enjoy laying down some ink with this set of assorted disposable needles.</li>
            <li> Clean packaging as well and bubble wrapped with my other product.</li>
            <li> I buy my needles from here, at times when my first choice happens to be out of needles, for my small tattoo business like mine where its not really worth making your own, which are aggravating.</li>
            <li> I just received this needles last week fast shipping and brand new sterilized needles...</li>
            <li> and every single point was secure and sterilized properly.</li>
            <li> Same quality I get from high end needles without the high end price.  </li>
            <li> Not the best needles to use on doing tattoos, but for just starting they&#x27;re not too bad.</li>
            <li> The 100 Pieces Mixed Assorted Disposable Tattoo Needles T100 came as advertised, shipped fast and had no defects so far</li>
            <li> All my labels were clearly printed, with size and expiration dates.</li>
            <li> Depending on how much tattooing you do, this pack can last a while.</li>
            <li> As far as ordering needles from &amp;#34;Johnson and Johnson,&amp;#34; do not waste your time.</li>
            <li> but i had no issues as far as that goes</li>
            <li> Each one in a sterile package that was completely sealed.  </li>
            <li> No burs so far.</li>
            <li> Poorly made needles most of then arnt straight</li>
            <li> exactly what it said it would be, a very decent assortment for a bulk order, i little of everything, will be ordering again</li>
            <li> I got exactly what was described, 10 of each of the sizes from 3rl to 9rl, and 5rs, 7rs, and 9rs, and 5,7,9 single stack mags</li>
            <li> Overall you cant beat the price for a decent box of needles.</li>
            <li> You cant possibly tattoo a straight line with a crooked needle.</li>
            <li> Nice variety of needles, but not very many single needles (12), other</li>
            <li> A general combination of shader and liners.</li>
            <li> pretty long expiration date so their not old stock.</li>
            <li> Too much solder, grouping askew, etc.</li>
            <li> I have only tried a couple of them so far</li>
            <li> cheap as chips and very few problems, only had to junk ten needles out of one hundred!</li>
            <li> Got my order earlier then expected and it was packaged very well.</li>
            <li> weren&#x27;t even sealed like wtf an then on top of that they dull too quick</li>
            <li> Brand NEW needles running BLACK INK FROM PREVIOUS USES STRAIGHT OUT THE PACKAGE.</li>
            <li> Well I always inspect my needle tips with magnifier before I proceed to tattoo, Looking for flat sides barbed or hooked tips.  </li>
            <li> No flaws so far, and we have used about half of our order.  </li>
            <li> No flaws so far, and we have used about half of our order.</li>
            <li> The only thing I disliked was the packaging of the actual needles.</li>
            <li> the only main issue i have is they hard hard to seperate from each other, other then that i highly recomend them for anyone lookin for needles.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;5x of each or 10x of each most of the common sizes there is 1 or 2 of the random sizes are</li>
            <li> but i recieved it in only a few days</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used a few but no problems to report.</li>
            <li> Although they do work as they should, I just expected Monster Point Needles.</li>
            <li> Regrettably, I could type on and on about how poor the quality really is.</li>
            <li> I had the needles in my mailbox within 72 hours of placing the order, 6 days before the expected delivery date!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> When they came, was in plain white.</li>
            <li> and i would refer other people to them</li>
            <li> I have to say some orders from other companies I find maybe 4 out of 50 that aren&#x27;t usable</li>
            <li> After reading other reviews about this product I was unsure what to expect upon arrival.</li>
            <li> Single Stack Magnum # 10 7RL Round Liner # 10</li>
            <li> 7RS Round Shader # 10 7M1 Single Stack Magnum # 10 9RL Round Liner # 10 9RS Round Shader # 10 9M1 Single Stack Magnum&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t</li>
            <li> you never seem to let me down.</li>
            <li> These arrived as described and my Husband has used these same ones in the past and is please with them!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t notice because I tattoo so much in black...</li>
            <li> i ordered a pack an half of them shits</li>
            <li> Forgiveness does not cancel quice this article was inadvertently confused sorry for this pictures and thought to buy something confusing but please do not send me my product case and many apologies</li>
            <li> Some of the needle heads are off by a little.</li>
            <li> The mags pack in the ink with little damage to the skin.</li>
            <li> Very bad finish at the welt of the needles, can be more carefully welded!!</li>
            <li> My only small issue was that a few of the needles I could not use due to the seal being broken.</li>
            <li> 3RL Round Liner # 10 5RL Round Liner # 10 5RS Round Shader</li>
            <li> The packaged arrived a day late due to letter carrier error.</li>
            <li> Its just plain ol&#x27;</li>
            <li> so im not sure what others are talking about</li>
            <li> Cones with the sizes needed to do basic tattoos and difficult ones as well.</li>
            <li> They do work for practice on non human skin, like fruit or fake skin(which sucks).</li>
            <li> The nidles isn&#x27;t monster and after 30mins of use,they seem to get dull</li>
            <li> When I got these, a lot of the needle prongs were broken and lots of needles were actually missing.</li>
            <li> Enough of every type of needle so you shouldn&#x27;t need to reuse anything, which is bad juju.</li>
            <li> The only thing bad I have to say is that It came with some magnum needles</li>
            <li> I get annoyed breaking the packages apart</li>
            <li> Poor quality some needles had barbs</li>
            <li> Not happy guys</li>
            <li> and i&#x27;m sorry</li>
            <li> you will not be sorry that you got them</li>
            <li> but I do wish they would label them, like which needles are used for what, if ur a newbie this is very frustrating, but you could always go online to look it up as well,</li>
            <li> Not very good.the kit I got was horrible!</li>
            <li> but they too were not all sterile , it dangerous in my profession to use items like this, all i wanted was the correct item</li>
            <li> They have stray needles just poking out in random directions!</li>
            <li> and I have had not come across a bad needle yet in this set.</li>
            <li> It felt like 1/4 of it was bad.</li>
            <li> However, I am disappointed because at the end of the description it says it also comes with A&amp;D Ointment which I did not receive.</li>
            <li> this product is crap</li>
            <li> AT ALL JUST SOME WEIRD BRAND CALLED DRAGON HAWK!!!!!</li>
            <li> you get what you paid for the packaging is the worst port.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> just as expected, they are great. exactly the mixture I needed.</li>
            <li> These were great for cheaper generic needles.. Perfect for a starter pack or if you want to try out a variety of sizes you do not normally use. I rarely had a mis-formed one the grouping is also fairly consistent, and they worked great. I have seen other generic needles that are just complete trash, but these were good.</li>
            <li> I ordered a mixed set of a 100 and in the deception it said you get 10 of each and i&#x27;m sorry but i only got 5 of each size and that&#x27;s in the rl and rs and the m1 also&lt;br /&gt;i only got and you sure cant read most of the writing on some of them its like they said heck with it and stuck all different sized tattoo needles in a boxes hoping that it will work if they will send me the ones like they have in there  deception would be great and i would refer other people to them</li>
            <li> I love it I got them for my friend he said his needle work good and he loves they make his tattoo gun works better</li>
            <li> First, I know NOTHING about real tat needles. For a total amateur who doesnt know any better, these are good.</li>
            <li> Showed promptly  and was a great assortment plenty of needles for what i do</li>
            <li> i havent used the product yet but i recieved it in only a few days the needles were well packaged an none were expired!! thanks i will be ordering again soon![[ASIN:B0043CU6JQ 100 Pieces Mixed Assorted Disposable Tattoo Needles T100]]</li>
            <li> Will be ordering again</li>
            <li> A lot and a good price.</li>
            <li> This product came very fast and was very well packaged. This is a very good buy for your money. I will absolutely be ordering more needles from this company again.</li>
            <li> I was extremely happy to find a deal like this with the price of the needles.  However, I am disappointed because at the end of the description it says it also comes with A&amp;D Ointment which I did not receive.</li>
            <li> I rate 4 stars only because I know prices could be a bit lower.  As it should be we use new needles for every customer, cost going into pricing the tattoo. So this is not a bad deal at all, and when you need bulk in hurry... this will do.  No flaws so far, and we have used about half of our order.  We will order from here again.</li>
            <li> This item arrived VARY fast, 3 days! Package contained everything as described and there&#x27;s no damage at all. I haven&#x27;t had the chance to test them out yet, but I&#x27;m assuming they will work great. I was extremely happy with this deal and will definitely be ordering more in the future. THANK YOU :)</li>
            <li> These needles were good quality..they tattoo great, and have a great variety of types... nicely packed.. i will definitley be buying again.</li>
            <li> CAME IN TODAY AND OPENED THE PACKAGE AND WAS VERY PISSED CAUSE THEY ARE NOT MONSTER POINT NEEDLES AT ALL JUST SOME WEIRD BRAND CALLED DRAGON HAWK!!!!! I WANTED AMERICAN NEEDLES!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I actually don&#x27;t like these needles... Particularly the 5RL. I ordered them as back up and had to use a couple. After the first one, I thought it was just the needle I had picked out of the bunch but when I did another tattoo, I noticed that... it&#x27;s the needles! The magnums look great though...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess I could only recommend them for practice on practice skins or fruit. I&#x27;m going back to Precision.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy tattooing!</li>
            <li> Thank you guys for your service. Everything was as ordered. And of excellent quality. Was at my door the next day.  Loved the sticker you included. It is now on my toolbox.</li>
            <li> Good Quality product at a great Price! Came in very handy! They are nice don&#x27;t feel cheap and at a great price!What a Steal!</li>
            <li> Very basic set of needles just enough to work on any job. I wish it would have had some 4 flats but was completely satisfied with my purchase</li>
            <li> Did not come in the box on the photo...&lt;br /&gt;Wuldnt purchase again... Dossapointed with wht i thought i was geting...</li>
            <li> The packaged arrived a day late due to letter carrier error. Opened box and everything was nicely snug in the box. The product was exactly as described. Very happy with my purchase. Will use this seller again.</li>
            <li> This product was excellent and a recommended buy for those starting out or those with little time to create their own.  Thank you for a great transaction.</li>
            <li> The best proce I found on amazon. The items were exatly wat I order. Every needle was staril with the blue indecator dots tank you.</li>
            <li> I ordered these expecting to receive monster point needles.what I received was the cheapest made needles ive ever seen. \\&quot;Chinese crap\\&quot; who knows if there even sterile...Stop by piercing pros spend the few extra dollars and get real monster point needles.Every needle they sell  comes with a color changing strip to prove its been sterilized...</li>
            <li> Great deal!! My boyfriend does tattoos on the side and he always needs supplies i will now be getting everything on here because you cant beat this price! Everything was secruely wrapped and sealed. Very pleased with this purchase!</li>
            <li> Will oesee in the future</li>
            <li> You can never have enough needles if you do tats. Umm, 20 words. Seller shipped quickly. I&#x27;ve done plenty of tats and still have several left. Enough of every type of needle so you shouldn&#x27;t need to reuse anything, which is bad juju.</li>
            <li> Needles showed up quickly. I&#x27;ve only used a few but no problems to report. As of now I&#x27;d gladly order them again.</li>
            <li> Well advertised and exactly what show in the picture</li>
            <li> this product was just as stated in ad. they are clean and my husband was thrilled to get them. when he needs more i will be looking you up again</li>
            <li> there great for there price i only tat my self no one else so i like them and the price cant beat it 17 buck hell ya. they came really fast in the mail and there all good you will not be sorry that you got them</li>
            <li> I love it when everything goes good when I order something. Everything was as stated. Thank you, I will definitely be using this company again.</li>
            <li> Love em, I&#x27;m getting these everytime. Every needle has a sticker showing it clean and new which is great cause the customer see&#x27;s that also......</li>
            <li> Received everything as described. Was on time or before shipping date.. My only small issue was that a few of the needles I could not use due to the seal being broken. I understand the needles don&#x27;t have the best self packaging system themselves so this may not be due to the seller.</li>
            <li> Good quality. Shipped fast</li>
            <li> got them in the mail on time they come with alot of variety for any kind of tattooing great to start out with otherwise you&#x27;ll be paying a dollar a needle at a local tattoo supply store and you dont have to deal with the hassle of going out to get them</li>
            <li> Came on time, had exacally what seller said it would. ive used more than 15 needles, prefect bar and needle alignment, steralized and sealed. cant get any easier. or cheaper.</li>
            <li> great needles, all the common sizes, 10 of each. I buy my needles from here, at times when my first choice happens to be out of needles, for my small tattoo business like mine where its not really worth making your own, which are aggravating.</li>
            <li> love the different sizes. we use them all and it is so helpful the shipping was great. and I know where to get them when I need more thank you</li>
            <li> So, I thought these were good until I decided to use white ink. Brand NEW needles running BLACK INK FROM PREVIOUS USES STRAIGHT OUT THE PACKAGE. Didn&#x27;t notice because I tattoo so much in black...WERE THEY EVEN STERILIZED?? Will be reporting! CHECK PHOTO.</li>
            <li> When I purchased these, they were advertised as Monster Point needles. They showed in the picture the Monster Point needles box. When they came, was in plain white. Although they do work as they should, I just expected Monster Point Needles. Still worth the price and the shipping was better then expected. I would buy from this seller again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also - No A&amp;D Ointment as stated comes with purchase.</li>
            <li> Gave three stars because was happy with the needles but I received 3RS needles instead of the 9M1 needles I was hoping for from the description...</li>
            <li> Came very fast three days and they were a great price but it wasn&#x27;t what I was expecting pretty much the most generic needles made. Same ones that come with the tattoo kits found on amazon!!! Won&#x27;t do business again.</li>
            <li> nice product it fits great works great my client is please and i happy i choose this supplier looking forward to more products</li>
            <li> This is a good variety pack of needles it has different types of needles along with liner and shaders.I would recommend this item to anyone good needles at a reasonable price also</li>
            <li> This product did come damaged (box) which made some of the needles unusable. Aside from that they work well. Thanks</li>
            <li> Bought this for my granddaughter for xmas.  She hasn&#x27;t gotten it yet but am sure she will be glad to get this.  She has gotten these before and they work great.</li>
            <li> It came fast with no problems and included all the needles it says. They were all sealed and ready to use.</li>
            <li> Get what you pay for. Seams on some needles were split open...no longer sanitary. Also metal flakes on needles from soldering.</li>
            <li> 100 pieces of mixed assorted disposable tattoo needles was exactly how the producer of the product described it, and it met all my needs and expectations!</li>
            <li> This assortment of needles is great.  It contains many of the most used sizes.  Depending on how much tattooing you do, this pack can last a while.</li>
            <li> Huge variety, great quality, super afforable... what more can I say.</li>
            <li> The needles are good, the problem being I ordered it expecting the assorted variety in the description. Unfortunately I only received 2 needle types.  The package came with 50 5 Shaders and 50 7 Shaders&lt;br /&gt;The product description was:&lt;br /&gt;100 pieces Of Assorted Brand New Disposable Tattoo Needles Include: # 10 3RL Round Liner # 10 5RL Round Liner # 10 5RS Round Shader # 10 5M1 Single Stack Magnum # 10 7RL Round Liner # 10 7RS Round Shader # 10 7M1 Single Stack Magnum # 10 9RL Round Liner # 10 9RS Round Shader # 10 9M1 Single Stack Magnum&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t put your eggs in the basket on getting the full assortment!</li>
            <li> I got these tattoo needles from [...] and by far they are the best deal out there. I always get all my tattoo and piercing supplies from there. I am never dissappointed</li>
            <li> Great needles alot of varieties well packaged  fast shipping  couldn&#x27;t ask for nothing better im satisfied with my purchase will perchase some more sooner or later.</li>
            <li> this assorted set of needles is the best deal i have ever found on this item if you need a array of needles for your business this set of assorted needles has it all and at a very good price i will always buy my needles from amazon thanks again amazon</li>
            <li> Good needles.  Pretty decent assortment.  I get annoyed breaking the packages apart but that&#x27;s not that a knock on the needle quality.</li>
            <li> Bought these for my brother who is a tattoo artist and he loved them. Its worth the price you pay and they are great quality.</li>
            <li> Awesome deal and super fast shipping. Item was exactly as described. I&#x27;ve looked at all the tips to the needles and they seem to be soldered/groupings perfectly. But I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;m going to run into sum from time to time with burrs in them. IF so, no big deal, still a great bang for your buck. Definitely will be doing business with this seller again with no worries. I got exactly what was described, 10 of each of the sizes from 3rl to 9rl, and 5rs, 7rs, and 9rs, and 5,7,9 single stack mags</li>
            <li> I got them really fast an they are very clean an no damage an the needs are very easy to read an tells what they are very clearly</li>
            <li> Items were as described. pretty long expiration date so their not old stock. id order again.</li>
            <li> arrived on time quality as good as any other needles i have used and price was right so it was a no brainer for me and they are all serialized to</li>
            <li> For the money, I figured I would try them out... Lesson learned. SAVE YOUR $! They are NOT MONSTER POINT. They do however seem to be cheap, Chinese, junk!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upon opening the package and examining the needles, there  is no way they should be used for a tattoo on live skin! Most needles are soldered onto the bars crooked!!! Secondly, most of the needle tips I examined through the loop were barbed! Blow outs are in the house! Third, some needles weren&#x27;t even grouped evenly! They have stray needles just poking out in random directions! How would one tattoo with that I ask? Fourth, they are TEXTURED needles! I don&#x27;t even use textured needles... And it didn&#x27;t advertise being sold as such. Regrettably, I could type on and on about how poor the quality really is. But, just avoid these needles! You should not tattoo with them. Hopefully, I can get  a refund through Amazon... They are usually great with customer service. As far as ordering needles from &amp;#34;Johnson and Johnson,&amp;#34; do not waste your time. You cant possibly tattoo a straight line with a crooked needle. Its just plain ol&#x27; physics!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I made my own needles for years... and taught many apprentices to do so. Take the advice...</li>
            <li> Great Product!!! Great Quality!!! Everything Came As Described!!!</li>
            <li> I rate 4 stars only because I know prices could be a bit lower. As it should be we use new needles for every customer, cost going into pricing the tattoo. So this is not a bad deal at all, and when you need bulk in hurry... this will do. No flaws so far, and we have used about half of our order. We will order from here again.&lt;br /&gt;[...]</li>
            <li> Really good value on a variety of needles, more suited for practice skin though.  Chewed my shoulder up, went through several needles for a pretty small tattoo</li>
            <li> Well worth the money. All different sizes of needles. I love the needles in this pack that I can shade with. You can do outlines and all kinds of shading.</li>
            <li> Love the assorted needles ! But i did find one that had cotten stuck in between the needles themselves, it was still in the package.</li>
            <li> When I got these, a lot of the needle prongs were broken and lots of needles were actually missing.</li>
            <li> Not the best needles to use on doing tattoos, but for just starting they&#x27;re not too bad.</li>
            <li> Boyfriend was excited when opened after Christmas. Got him a whole new tattoo kit with a case and new tat guns</li>
            <li> These are awesome but I do wish they would label them, like which needles are used for what, if ur a newbie this is very frustrating, but you could always go online to look it up as well, lol</li>
            <li> decent quality gets the job done</li>
            <li> packaging came very well packed and safe. no damage what so ever. will buy from them again. great buy for your money. in my opinion its the best product company and best pricing to find.</li>
            <li> This was an unreal deal. A lot for a little in terms of the price for how many needles you get and they work just fine.</li>
            <li> O vendedor &amp;eacute; otimo e o produto dele tambem , são de primeira , recomendo a todos que trabalham no ramo da tatuagem a usar este produto , o preço poderia ser um pouco melhor mas tudo bem , mesmo assim recomendo .</li>
            <li> I got these for less than a dollar more than a similar box offered because reviews said the variety was better. Im very pleased &amp; the 100 disposable tips for $5 &amp; change compliment it well because the tips fit all these needles with some to spare for larger sizes. I would recommend these &amp; may buy again when I need more. Needles can cost about a dollar each if bought individually locally so if the sizes are useful to you then buy these.</li>
            <li> exactly what it said it would be, a very decent assortment for a bulk order, i little of everything, will be ordering again</li>
            <li> Well I always inspect my needle tips with magnifier before I proceed to tattoo, Looking for flat sides barbed or hooked tips.  I have to say some orders from other companies I find maybe 4 out of 50 that aren&#x27;t usable no big deal for some but its important to me to get a great product every time. Well I&#x27;ve ordered from this company before and I found 1 for the 100 i reviewed now that&#x27;s what I call cost effective for a great product!!!!</li>
            <li> Needs more variety of sizes of needles we need more 8 round shaders and larger sizes like 11 &amp; 13</li>
            <li> Given as gift, no complaints</li>
            <li> Perfect and exactly what i needed,&lt;br /&gt;amazon you never seem to let me down.</li>
            <li> Poor quality some needles had barbs</li>
            <li> I was very happy with the needles especially for the price, the quality was good and I have had not come across a bad needle yet in this set. I will definitely be a return customer to this distributor. I recommend these needles to anyone.</li>
            <li> this product is crap i ordered a pack an half of them shits weren&#x27;t even sealed like wtf an then on top of that they dull too quick do NOT buy this product spend the extra couple bucks an get good quality needles you&#x27;ll be happier that you did.</li>
            <li> Not very good.the kit I got was horrible! It seemed like I was always changing my needles cuz they were so s***ty! You get what you pay for obviously</li>
            <li> Quick delivery, quality product</li>
            <li> it was great........ ....... ....... ....... ....... ........ ...... .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. . . . ..</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know what to expect when I ordered these, other than an assortment of needles, but I&#x27;m very satisfied with the assortment. The quality of the needles is very good. The only thing bad I have to say is that It came with some magnum needles and I don&#x27;t really use them at all. That&#x27;s still more of a perk then con.</li>
            <li> Everything came quickly, and as described. The only thing I disliked was the packaging of the actual needles. The packaging seems to get damaged extremely easy. Which isnt good because I had to throw away a large number of them due to decontamination. Other than that, everything was great.</li>
            <li> I received a great variety of different needles, and they were in sterile conditions and packages separated neatly! I will definitely be buying this product again!</li>
            <li> I would like to start by saying that they are not monster point needles and if that&#x27;s what your looking for move on. but with that being said they are not bad for the price...but do not buy them if you plan on getting a specific size because they do not come labeled...they did send me the 100 needles so i did give them 3 stars because the needles i did get are good quality and shipping was fast just know that if your ordering them for a specific size you could end up not getting any of them or as many as 15 of the same needle as this is an assorted pack...also every one of them have been sterilized by e.o gas so im not sure what others are talking about but i had no issues as far as that goes</li>
            <li> Arrived just in time. Packaging was sublime. and every single point was secure and sterilized properly. Will defiantly be making this my choice of needles from now on.</li>
            <li> For the price and the amount that I received it is phenomenal. Clean packaging as well and bubble wrapped with my other product. This was definitely an excellent purchase and I&#x27;m super happy. I paid for about a 3rd of what I would have paid for in a local supply shop! Excellent service as well, received them super fast!</li>
            <li> Extremely fast delivery time! Nice variety of needles, but not very many single needles (12), other than that it&#x27;s PERFECT!</li>
            <li> Bought these needles several times. They are great. Tho they are usualy a mix of manufactuers they all seem fine and work great</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t know if they fit his tattoo gun yet or not but will write more later. So keep checking in a couple of wks</li>
            <li> Good material everything in good conditions too I like them also is what I wanted too&lt;br /&gt;Also I receive my material faster than what I though.</li>
            <li> great needles, they are build very good,, work fantastic</li>
            <li> I bought these as a gift and my daughter is completely happy with them. Good price for the number you get.</li>
            <li> product is exactly what is shown  great assortment  will def order more as well as continue to do buniess with peircing pros</li>
            <li> alotta of needles noticed there wasent as many of what they said in the box&lt;br /&gt;5x of each or 10x of each most of the common sizes there is 1 or 2 of the random sizes are plentifull seems like a b.s mix pack of randomness</li>
            <li> Good verity, price &amp; packaging. They stay organized &amp; clean with each needle stereal &amp; ready to go. Will get good use out of them.</li>
            <li> The 100 Pieces Mixed Assorted Disposable Tattoo Needles T100 came as advertised, shipped fast and had no defects so far (I am thru the first 50) The Assortment is good and evenly spaced, I will order needles from them again</li>
            <li> cheap as chips and very few problems, only had to junk ten needles out of one hundred! which I call a win...</li>
            <li> love these for the price</li>
            <li> I am completely impressed with this seller and products. I actually got Monster Point needles which are better then the ones pictured. I had the needles in my mailbox within 72 hours of placing the order, 6 days before the expected delivery date!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product to anyone needing dependable tattoo needles, shipping was amazing and I now found a dependable seller that I can buy all my tattoo stuff from. Thank You!</li>
            <li> These arrived as described and my Husband has used these same ones in the past and is please with them! Would recommend to others!</li>
            <li> Worked great for me but you got to keep in mind there is only about 10 needles per size. this kit is good for someone trying to learn what different needles do.</li>
            <li> A few needles were opened... ended up tossing the whole box.</li>
            <li> saved ne sooo much money buying these needles from here way worth the money cant beat the price and quality</li>
            <li> recieved needles fast. In the box as pictured and needles labeled sterile and size labeled. Will be buying  from this company real soon.</li>
            <li> Ok I ordered these and when they came in the boxes were completely smashed, and open !!!! Now I can&#x27;t use these needles that I ordered for a big client that was suppose to be here tommarow. Not happy guys</li>
            <li> the ones I got were not monster point they were genaric with out the blue indicator dot showing they were sterile. I ended up re steralizing them just to be sure. They do work for practice on non human skin, like fruit or fake skin(which sucks).</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was hoping for. A gift for an artist and they have been working out really well. Thanks!</li>
            <li> There is a needle for every job. This is an assortment of ten types of needles from rl3 to fs9  a verry good buy. Myself I am a beginner tattoo artist so I needed the different types to learn with so if you are in need of ink slinging this is the thing you need.</li>
            <li> great product, great price</li>
            <li> What can I say, they are sharp, clean and work great. How much can really be said about needles? Oh and they are affordable, great for practicing.</li>
            <li> got my order on time. no problems what so ever. and there isnt really any thing more to add to it</li>
            <li> For the most part these are good needles. I would say 1 out of 10 have some sort of flaw. Too much solder, grouping askew, etc. Overall you cant beat the price for a decent box of needles. All my labels were clearly printed, with size and expiration dates. Seals intact. Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Cones with the sizes needed to do basic tattoos and difficult ones as well. Perfectly packaged. Sterile and easy to access on the whim</li>
            <li> You can never have enough</li>
            <li> Poorly made needles most of then arnt straight</li>
            <li> Awsome product. Clean and ready to use. I have no complaints. Price was graet as well. Dont change anything at all.</li>
            <li> Straight and sharpgreat deal</li>
            <li> These needles are perfect and I plan to order more. Sterile and individually packaged.</li>
            <li> i hope the t 100 are monster points as they say ,i will find out when i get them,and let you no.they come up as monster point on there site,but, the just say t 100, not monster points,so what in the hell are they? i&#x27;m writing the seller and find out the truth because i want monster points only,well we will see what the hells going on and why they are not called monster point but they are on monster point site.</li>
            <li> This was a great buy.  I was very happy with the amount I paid for this.  They were already packaged and separated.  I will buy these again.</li>
            <li> Thank you for sending on time and I am so very glad that it was what I needed it made it easy for me</li>
            <li> I enjoy laying down some ink with this set of assorted disposable needles. Cant wait to buy more of them .</li>
            <li> this is exactly what i wanted everything is as it was described in the order im happy with this product</li>
            <li> This is a perfect choice for any tattoo artist, a wide variety of needles to serve many purposes from outlining to shading!&lt;br /&gt;Round needles, linear needles, and magnum needles.&lt;br /&gt;Great option, and cost effective</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t had a chance to use them yet but everything came in their packs and non were damaged.  If I go through these I will buy more... it was a great deal.</li>
            <li> Forgiveness does not cancel quice this article was inadvertently confused sorry for this pictures and thought to buy something confusing but please do not send me my product case and many apologies</li>
            <li> The nidles isn&#x27;t monster and after 30mins of use,they seem to get dull but overall it&#x27;s a great buy for the price! You get what you pay for</li>
            <li> The mixture of different needles are great. Was able to use some at different moments of my project without any problems.</li>
            <li> Great Purchase. Quick shipment.</li>
            <li> Needles are ok, don&#x27;t feel like we got what the description said it was supposed to be, but still used them.</li>
            <li> Great box of needles came fast and well packed I&#x27;ve used about 20 needles and have had no problems so far. Definitely a great buy</li>
            <li> Cheap and great I bought it and 2 days later it was out my house. All and all a good product .</li>
            <li> All the needles arrived soon, but it said it would come with A&amp;D Ointment, something I needed. It did not. Just another thing I have to buy now.</li>
            <li> Very bad finish at the welt of the needles, can be more carefully welded!!</li>
            <li> Got my order earlier then expected and it was packaged very well. I am, so happy with this product. Easiest convenient way to get a supply of sterilized tattoo needles. Thanks Monster Point!</li>
            <li> These are a great buy and worked great, will be buying these again.  Thank you for the great product yep.</li>
            <li> A general combination of shader and liners.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with the quality of the product not one of the seals were broke. All sterile very professional quality needles no burs on the needles like cheap needles weld hold up good.on the connection of needle to rod</li>
            <li> There deffinenitly great needles especially for the price I&#x27;m very happy with the needles u get a great selection of needles to start tattooing I will for sure  order from this supplier again</li>
            <li> Thought they were supposed to be monster point needleds&lt;br /&gt;Their some off brand not bad or anything&lt;br /&gt;Great deal for the price</li>
            <li> The product is excellent and great to work with I have had no issues and use these on a daily basis! I will be ordering this product again! Great quality product!</li>
            <li> Got replacements but they too were not all sterile , it dangerous in my profession to use items like this, all i wanted was the correct item</li>
            <li> Very fast delivery very satisfied</li>
            <li> I liked these needles they&#x27;re sharp and good with tattooing. I&#x27;ll definitely be buying more from this brand for sure!(:</li>
            <li> Good quallity Great price ftw lol</li>
            <li> I really like the way these disposable tattoo needles work, as do some friends of mine who have used them as well.</li>
            <li> Very good deal, love these needles.</li>
            <li> I thought I was ordering the whole tube but IT&#x27;S JUSTIN THE TIPS. Now that I got the piece to use them they work great and are good for their price</li>
            <li> These rock. I have only tried a couple of them so far but they seem pretty consistent, and you can&#x27;t beat the price (unless you make your own maybe). good stuff. Will order again soon.</li>
            <li> Good quality needles and they came undamaged.  Each one in a sterile package that was completely sealed.  Same quality I get from high end needles without the high end price.  The taper on the end is nice and long so they don&#x27;t cause added trauma to the skin, another plus.</li>
            <li> They came in sufficient time. Not all of the needles were sealed. It was as if the glue wore off, but for the price u get what u pay for.</li>
            <li> Very happy with product and whole experience.will shop amozon in future.good stuff!!!</li>
            <li> great needles, but some where bent no big deal...</li>
            <li> They were very pleased with the results of the product that I had oderered as as a gift so it would be safer and cleaner for them.</li>
            <li> This product never fails my expectations. No burs so far. even under 100X they are what they claim.&lt;br /&gt;Will always come back and shall recommend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://4evainked570.wix.com/4eva?from_fb&#x3D;1#</li>
            <li> you get what you paid for the packaging is the worst port. Some of the needle heads are off by a little. You can use it but it needs improvement last i got it. Perfect for practicing on fake skin and learn the difference between a good needle and a bad one. It felt like 1/4 of it was bad.</li>
            <li> So far the quality is great. They are built even and straight. The mags pack in the ink with little damage to the skin. Shipping was awesome.</li>
            <li> I just received this needles last week fast shipping and brand new sterilized needles... I gave them to my tatto artist and im so happy about the results of my tattoo... Ill post another with the pix of my nerw tattoo and the needle just perfectly what stated in amazon...</li>
            <li> Great product use everyday good amount of needles</li>
            <li> for the $your dishing out, you wont be dissappointed. i have had and used better needles but they cost me almost twice as much. great pack. great buy. the only main issue i have is they hard hard to seperate from each other, other then that i highly recomend them for anyone lookin for needles. i will buy again and incouragemy friend to grab them up</li>
            <li> Needle groupings are great, every single one had a great fit on the grommet nipple, not too tight or too loose. You&#x27;ve got everything you need here to do any kind of tattoo.</li>
            <li> I received this item 4 days before the estimated delivery date! After reading other reviews about this product I was unsure what to expect upon arrival. As others had posted that they did not receive Monster Point needles. I am extremely happy with this product and can confirm that the needles delivered to me are in fact monster Point and came with a great variety of sizes.&lt;br /&gt;I will absolutely order this product, from this company again!!!</li>
            <li> The supplies I ordered came rapidly as expected  and were of good quality</li>
            <li> These are just what they said they were and I would recommend them to anyone that is doing tattoos. Great product</li>
