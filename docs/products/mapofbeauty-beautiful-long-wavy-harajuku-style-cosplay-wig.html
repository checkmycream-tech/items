            <li>It doesn&#x27;t come with the bow, but it&#x27;s still a really nice wig.</li>
            <li>Exact to the picture, except the blond part is slightly more yellow.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very happy with this, and I think you will be too, if this is what you want!</li>
            <li>This wig was gorgeous beyond belief, it comes with a free wig cap.</li>

            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>I love the quality, the structure, and feel of this wig.</li>
            <li>Its ok.</li>
            <li>Love the wig but need someone to cut the wig to fit my face.  </li>
            <li>For the price this amazing, long, shiny, colors are great.</li>
            <li>I got this to wear to a costume party, it was fine.  </li>
            <li>but I thought this one was pretty nice for a cheap price.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth every penny and more.</li>
            <li>Long silky and beautiful.</li>
            <li>I will have to see if other item&#x27;s from this seller are as good!</li>
            <li>I was honestly so excited for this wig .</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been so excited about this product ever since I found it.</li>
            <li>but it gives it a really nice natural curl look.</li>
            <li>I love this wig sooooo much.</li>
            <li>First of all, I love this wig so much!</li>
            <li>Other then that it would be very nice.</li>
            <li>Very pretty.</li>
            <li>I rate this a 5 because it came in quickly and the product was very well made!!</li>
            <li>It fits great and doesn&#x27;t weigh my head down.</li>
            <li>It does shed when you first start brushing it</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really soft and surprisingly full.</li>
            <li>I collect wigs of medium quality (high heat resistance, various styles, etc), and can say that this wig is on par with most of my nicer ones.</li>
            <li>Second of all, this wig came in so quickly!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know much about wigs</li>
            <li>not as much hair as I thought thered be...</li>
            <li>Other than that I love the vibrant color of the wig!</li>
            <li>Bangs to long but love the feel soft.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a really great wig, the pink was slightly lighter than I guess I had thought, imagine a cotton candy wig...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s surprisingly really soft and it looked exactly like the picture.</li>
            <li>The only upsetting thing is that it takes FOREVER to come, but it was worth it</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s long and gets tangled easily, but it comes with a net to put over your hair to keep it in place under the wig.  </li>
            <li>Pretty long!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s silky soft to the touch, just remember to brush it with a wig brush, not a regular brush or else</li>
            <li>Most people said it was thin, but mines wasn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>It is thin on top, the tracks can be seen.  </li>
            <li>Pretty much a waste .</li>
            <li>Good material, only a little difficult to style.</li>

            <li> Good material, only a little difficult to style.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a quality, long lasting wig for a often worn costume, keep looking</li>
            <li> Not a real issue for me, my hair&#x27;s short.  </li>
            <li> My mannequin likes it - the side bangs definitely fall in her face though, so I have to pin them back a little.</li>
            <li> I usually try not to get my hopes up when ordering offline, but this product was above my expectations for only $11.</li>
            <li> but it is a little thin on the top where you expect it to be thick</li>
            <li> But it was nothing like I expected.</li>
            <li> so I might need to buy a different wig cap considering how thick my hair is.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that its fairly thin.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s a little thin and my hair is to long and to thick</li>
            <li> so it looks weird.</li>
            <li> Which looked so bad on me.</li>
            <li> Sadly disappointed</li>
            <li> or you can see the wig part... :(</li>

            <li> I got this to wear to a costume party, it was fine.  It&#x27;s long and gets tangled easily, but it comes with a net to put over your hair to keep it in place under the wig.  Not a real issue for me, my hair&#x27;s short.  But if you&#x27;re looking for something to wear occasionally for a party, this is it.  If you&#x27;re looking for a quality, long lasting wig for a often worn costume, keep looking</li>
            <li> My mannequin likes it - the side bangs definitely fall in her face though, so I have to pin them back a little.</li>
            <li> Very pretty. I bought five wigs, and this one is my favorite.</li>
            <li> This wig was damaged before I got it</li>
            <li> Ok so I&#x27;m short and fat but this was perfect. It does shed when you first start brushing it and it drpve me nuts. It also bunches but it gives it a really nice natural curl look. I love this but it is a little thin on the top where you expect it to be thick I am buying again just a different color</li>
            <li> First of all, I love this wig so much! Second of all, this wig came in so quickly! It said it was gonna come between the end of November to December 16! But it came like a week later!!! I rate this a 5 because it came in quickly and the product was very well made!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a really great wig, the pink was slightly lighter than I guess I had thought, imagine a cotton candy wig... But I love it :)</li>
            <li> Much better than advertised! Long silky and beautiful. It&#x27;s worth every penny and more. I will have to see if other item&#x27;s from this seller are as good!</li>
            <li> I just got this wig today and I love it!For someone who is more on the kawaii side than I think this wig is for you!It&#x60;s longer than in the picture too!I am about 5 foot 1 so it goes about to my bellybotton....Pretty long! I LOVE IT^.^</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t come with the bow, but it&#x27;s still a really nice wig. Good material, only a little difficult to style. Recommended.</li>
            <li> I collect wigs of medium quality (high heat resistance, various styles, etc), and can say that this wig is on par with most of my nicer ones. My only complaint is that its fairly thin. I&#x27;ll be purchasing another one to weft together. It can hold itself as is, but any sort of styling tends to expose the netting underneath.</li>
            <li> This wig is so beautiful in person. I&#x27;m very pleased with texture and look of this wig. It fits great and doesn&#x27;t weigh my head down. It&#x27;s silky soft to the touch, just remember to brush it with a wig brush, not a regular brush or else it will fray. But I would definatly recommend this for anyone is looking for a kawaii wig.</li>
            <li> I was honestly so excited for this wig . But it was nothing like I expected. Looks really fake and the blonde part is more like WHITE. Which looked so bad on me. Pretty much a waste . Sadly disappointed</li>
            <li> The wig wasn&#x27;t as good as it looked and u could tell it was a wig</li>
            <li> Works great for my costume.</li>
            <li> Love the wig but need someone to cut the wig to fit my face.  Bangs to long but love the feel soft.</li>
            <li> This wig was gorgeous beyond belief, it comes with a free wig cap. It&#x27;s really soft and surprisingly full. Most people said it was thin, but mines wasn&#x27;t. I love this wig sooooo much. The only upsetting thing is that it takes FOREVER to come, but it was worth it</li>
            <li> I got my wig in one day before Halloween which is perfect! I love it, it&#x27;s a little thin and my hair is to long and to thick so it looks weird. It comes with a mesh wig cap so I might need to buy a different wig cap considering how thick my hair is. Other than that I love the vibrant color of the wig!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know much about wigs but I thought this one was pretty nice for a cheap price. It&#x27;s surprisingly really soft and it looked exactly like the picture. I would definitely buy from this user again~</li>
            <li> For the price this amazing, long, shiny, colors are great.</li>
            <li> Exact to the picture, except the blond part is slightly more yellow.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very happy with this, and I think you will be too, if this is what you want!</li>
            <li> I love the quality, the structure, and feel of this wig. I wasn&#x27;t expecting it until the 23rd- Jan 8th. It came today Dec 15th. I&#x27;ve been so excited about this product ever since I found it. I usually try not to get my hopes up when ordering offline, but this product was above my expectations for only $11.</li>
            <li> not as much hair as I thought thered be... and I have to wear a hat or you can see the wig part... :(</li>
            <li> Its ok. It is thin on top, the tracks can be seen.  I guess that is why this wig is cheaper. Other then that it would be very nice.</li>
            <li> Cute! It does shed a lot and you can see the tracks, but the good thing is that it look great and I can&#x27;t wait to wear this on Halloween!</li>
