            <li>This is great stuff, just be patient when working up a good lather.</li>
            <li>Cost more but is awesome</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t believe I never checked Trader Joe&#x27;s and happy I did and at an great price for something that&#x27;s better than Giovanni!</li>
            <li>I liked it, it lathers well, rinses well and smells great, and it is affordable</li>
            <li>feels so good and luxurious.</li>
            <li>THE SHAMPOO IS GOOD AND</li>
            <li>My scalp feels good the day</li>
            <li>Good but Tue product at TJ&#x27;s is $4 vs. $10</li>
            <li>Yes, Trader Joes is good with food</li>
            <li>It smells nice and makes a great bubble bath.</li>
            <li>This shampoo is good for the price.  </li>
            <li>When I washed my hair, I loved the scent and the tingle.</li>
            <li>I loved the smell and feel of this shampoo.</li>
            <li>I have used all kinds of dandruff shampoo &amp; have never had good results.  </li>
            <li>also sometimes use it as a body wash, and it&#x27;s just as good there.</li>
            <li>Scent is good.</li>
            <li>my (coarse/straight) hair look and feel so good.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s a good product</li>
            <li>I have heard good things about this brand.</li>
            <li>arrived in good time.</li>
            <li>Suds are good but did not do a thing for the itching.</li>
            <li>Loved it when I tried it while visiting my brother.  </li>
            <li>As soon as used this product,we would not get any dandruff.&lt;br /&gt;Overall its a good product</li>
            <li>This is a good shampoo.  </li>
            <li>My husband did use it once for his beard (lol) &amp; liked it.</li>
            <li>I tried it once, the feeling is that it is good</li>
            <li>good shampoo.</li>
            <li>I thinks its good to use maybe once or twice a month to get all the mousse, oils, pomades or whatever you use completley out of your hair, I&#x27;ve started putting tea tree oil on my scalp and let it sit for a while or overnight and the itchyness has diminished</li>
            <li>It is all that it was promised to be and the price was good.</li>
            <li>I ran out to Trader Joe&#x27;s to buy both the shampoo and conditioner based on all the good reviews.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to miss the way it makes my hair look, but what looks good does not always feel good and is not always good for you.</li>
            <li>This is an excellent product, with true benefits for anyone suffering from eczema or dandruff.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The shampoo has a cool tingly feeling too and smells wonderful.</li>
            <li>Nice clean tingle, wonderful smell.</li>
            <li>It feels great and refreshing after using this product, so I wouldn&#x27;t mind purchasing it again.</li>
            <li>I had read amazing things about it, I love Trader Joe&#x27;s and the price was great ($3.99).</li>
            <li>I went for a hair cut and the stylist said my hair was very healthy and asked what kind of shampoo I use</li>
            <li>So tingly and refreshing!  </li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>u will be satisfied!</li>
            <li>I just love the scents of tea tree oil and lavender!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to order more because now my mom is using it!</li>
            <li>If you love the feel of mint and a chill, then spend the money to bring this product home!</li>
            <li>I love this stuff!</li>
            <li>Be sure to use a conditioner afterwards!</li>
            <li>love the scent!</li>
            <li>It smells great, I get a good clean without drying my hair or fading my henna.</li>
            <li>or whenever my hair feels like it is in need of a good clean.&lt;br /&gt;Tingly and great smelling, I also used this with the conditioner which was pretty good as well.&lt;br /&gt;Picked</li>
            <li>And yes, it really tingles!!!!!  </li>
            <li>This shampoo smells amazing and does give a nice tingling feeling.</li>
            <li>and it smells amazing.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s amazing for when you have product build up</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s amazing with the conditioner that goes with it</li>
            <li>It detangled my hair nicely.</li>
            <li>It does have a nice earthy scent though which I liked.</li>
            <li>It does have the nice tingle/cooling effect.</li>
            <li>but it is just refreshing, not damaging, it also smells good after.</li>
            <li>IT KIND OF A WAIST</li>
            <li>Nice lather.</li>
            <li>you won&#x27;t haft to make your own home made clarifying shampoo</li>
            <li>This makes a nice foamy bubble bath</li>
            <li>Smells nice and feels nice on the skin, however.</li>
            <li>ok- not as good as pm</li>
            <li>This is not the kind of shampoo where you&#x27;re gonna experience tingling smells immediately.</li>
            <li>Nice  </li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t use it all the time, as it would be too harsh, but is perfect for removing excess buildup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those who have oily hair - this would be perfect.</li>
            <li>This time the smell was nice</li>
            <li>Smells nice.</li>
            <li>This is a nice compromise.</li>
            <li>liked the way it smells and the way it made my hair look and feel, but....</li>
            <li>It was great and made my scalp feel so clean.</li>
            <li>great scent, helps with scalp itching and leaves my hair clean and shiny.  </li>
            <li>I was looking for a cheaper tea tree oil shampoo but still effective with natural and good non-cheap-synthetic-toxic-chemicals quality ingredients in it and found it at Trader Joe&#x27;s and this shampoo was purrrfect!!  </li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t like a minty smell, probably not for you, as it is a very strong scent.</li>
            <li>While the smell and clean feeling is really nice, this shampoo is so clarifying that it dries my hair out!  </li>
            <li>It smells wonderful and leaves your hair feeling fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>Even though the Tea Tree Tingle is cheap, it is still good quality, which I am amazed about.</li>
            <li>I am loving this shampoo and am so glad I ran across the review for it.</li>
            <li>if I had paiud $3, I would have liked it a lot better.</li>
            <li>Awesome tingly shampoo, I guess if there isn&#x27;t a Trader Joe&#x27;s near you</li>
            <li>After using this shampoo, I must use a good conditioner, as it will be SQUEAKY clean.</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo it smells great and leaves your scalp feeling tingly and fresh.</li>
            <li>Nice shampoo love peppermint in any product just love how it tingles and cleans my hair just using one wash.</li>
            <li>This is a good product; makes your hair soft and a great feeling on the scalp.  </li>
            <li>My head gets really hot when I&#x27;m sweating with my hair in a ponytail, and being able to scrub this shampoo in and feel like my scalp is standing on a mountain singing with Julie Andrews is a great after-gym treat.</li>
            <li>I was so happy to not feel itchy at all, and plus my curly long hair started to look great and bouncy and healthy again.  </li>
            <li>Once on the scalp, the wash provides a cooling/tingling sensation that is very refreshing and provides a clean</li>
            <li>I only use it to wash my scalp, and it&#x27;s the best.</li>
            <li>i love this shampoo.  </li>
            <li>Love the way it feels, if you have colored hair it will strip your color if you use a lot.</li>
            <li>I also love the ingredients.</li>
            <li>I have tried so many shampoos and conditioners, from Maroccan Oil, to Bumble to Bumble to Pantene to Redkin.</li>
            <li>My husband and I LOVE this shampoo</li>
            <li>After two uses, I love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I usually love all Trader Joe&#x27;s beauty products</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is one of the most cost effective tea tree shampoos available --- when purchased in a retail outlet.</li>
            <li>I love the way this shampoo tingles on my scalp</li>
            <li>I am so glad I purchased this.</li>
            <li>is light but effective.  </li>
            <li>Just not my favorite product of theirs.</li>
            <li>I love the invigorating feel.</li>
            <li>Have added it to our subscription service, so we never run out. :)</li>
            <li>Boy am I glad I read the reviews before ordering.</li>
            <li>Tingly and refreshing</li>
            <li>and personally I think this is the best clarifying shampoo cause</li>
            <li>Yes the price on Amazon is 6 to 7 dollars more than Trader Joes</li>
            <li>I wanted to love this product.</li>
            <li>Peppermint shampoo is a family favorite.  </li>
            <li>I love this shampoo.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t irritate my scalp like most shampoos do.  </li>
            <li>This is my favorite shampoo.</li>
            <li>my hair is more prone to frizz when I use this product</li>
            <li>Will continue to use for sure.</li>
            <li>It is ok.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Love this shampoo.</li>
            <li>i love that this shampoo have no laurel/laureth sulfates in it.</li>
            <li>I just love tea tree oil shampoos and this one is no exception.</li>
            <li>and I love the organic ingredients in it.</li>
            <li>It is more clarifying in a gentle way, and sets you up for a great conditioning treatment.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s enjoyable nonetheless.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, it does have a very noticeable &amp;#34;tingle,&amp;#34; it has a minty scent that men would like as well and works great for clarifying.</li>
            <li>Somehow guys like this smell.. he was very happy with the product and washes his hair everyday because it makes him feel good..</li>
            <li>but I would gladly pay $11 w/prime if I had to.</li>
            <li>but it is better than nothing.</li>
            <li>Leaves my hair feeling really refreshing.</li>
            <li>Also, I love the \\&quot;clean\\&quot; feeling you get.</li>
            <li>I love the way my hair shines and scalp feels because of the eucalyptus / organic ingredients.</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo.</li>
            <li>and I just love it.</li>
            <li>&amp; I love the tingle</li>
            <li>I love</li>
            <li>love the refreshing sensation on my scalp.</li>
            <li>I love the tingling feeling</li>
            <li>but they did have the nourish love the nourish.</li>
            <li>First the smell of this shampoo is amazing!</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t tried any more drastic measures yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is the shampoo I&#x27;m using now, and I like the smell and feel even better -</li>
            <li>I find it interesting that virtually all of them have been voted \\&quot;not</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo, it smells good and does exactly what it says it will do.</li>
            <li>Great product would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Gets hair very clean.</li>
            <li>I loved this shampoo at first.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money!!</li>
            <li>It is not my favorite, but it is indeed a go to for a fresh clean feel and on days when there&#x27;s buildup -- tea tree oil is good for that.  </li>
            <li>Just make sure you rinse properly is most important.</li>
            <li>I would definitely buy this again as it has a great smell and a nice tingle feeling.  </li>
            <li>think it is a great deal for a natural product.</li>
            <li>Even most sulfate free shampoos have sulfonamides.</li>
            <li>I love the tingle and light scent, and the &amp;#34;no animal testing&amp;#34; aspects.  </li>
            <li>I love the minty tingle of this shampoo and the way it cools your scalp, a nice touch after a sweaty workout or on a hot day.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fantastic, and I personally love using it after the gym.</li>
            <li>But it does a great job of cleaning your hair and leaves it soft.</li>
            <li>This product is great, natural ingredients peppermint, tea tree oil etc.</li>
            <li>&quot; considering that most are quite detailed and, to me, helpful.  </li>
            <li>I always thought you had to spend so much in order for your hair to look and feel good.</li>
            <li>Kinda watery consistency that requires too much product to get a good lather going.</li>
            <li>Good quality shampoos aren&#x27;t supposed to lather much and this one does</li>
            <li>Good product, shipped fast.  </li>
            <li>I love how natural it is and the smell is really pleasant (not too strong).</li>
            <li>you don&#x27;t have a TJ&#x27;s near you, I suggest you check out Nature&#x27;s Gate Tea Tree Shampoo... which is also very nice:  </li>
            <li>I have no problems producing a rich lather, it just has to be worked at a bit more.</li>
            <li>I really liked the shampoo and liked that it contained natural ingredients</li>
            <li>They were very quick in shipping as well.</li>
            <li>Love the clean feeling I get from using this shampoo.  </li>
            <li>The peppermint in the shampoo and condition is strong and gives you a tingle in your scalp</li>
            <li>I love Trader Joe&#x27;s, but I&#x27;m using twice as much shampoo just to work up a lather, so I&#x27;m not finding it cost effective.  </li>
            <li>Strongly recommend</li>
            <li>Not as strong as I hoped</li>
            <li>Very clean and smells nice too, does have a good deep clean to Trader Joe&#x27;s</li>
            <li>Great sulfate free, paraben free all natural shampoo.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This one lathers nicely, and is gentle on my kiddos hair!  </li>
            <li>I ended up using the other bottle with my foot brush to scrub my feet, which was perfect because I could enjoy the peppermint scent, and my feet didn&#x27;t react to the product.  </li>
            <li>Not a bad price, hear it&#x27;s even better at</li>
            <li>This tea tree shampoo is not harsh as some others are, and the smell is not too strong; it is quite pleasant.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t tell if this one spots until I either clean the shower curtain successfully or get a new one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My hair is wavy and fine.</li>
            <li>They didn&#x27;t have chemical based hair products a hundred years ago, and people were doing just fine without it.   </li>
            <li>Otherwise the shampoo was fine.</li>
            <li>it does the job just fine</li>
            <li>Great product...just as advertised...I would highly recommend this hair product..and it was shipped fast and safe in a baggy just in case an accident happened</li>
            <li>I really love the minty smell of the shampoo, and it lathered up pretty well and seemed to clean my hair OK.  </li>
            <li>Then I found the Trader Joe&#x27;s brand, and thought, this is great, practically the same ingredients for a fraction of the price ($3.99 at the store).</li>
            <li>I guess that is what you get getting cheap hair products at the pharmacy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve continued to use the product because I bought 5 bottles of it so that I could get free shipping</li>
            <li>Overall, a great value.</li>
            <li>and we really can&#x27;t afford that kind of expense.</li>
            <li>Nice scent, and cleans my hair really well.</li>
            <li>The peppermint scent is great in fact will open your sinus&#x27; while washing your hair.</li>
            <li>This is a great basic, non toxic product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>also like TJ&#x27;s Tea Tree conditioner... light on the hair, without being overpowering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Plus the price is fantastic.</li>
            <li>I bought this product because trader joes doesn&#x27;t test on animals and that is important to me.</li>
            <li>Awesome Shampoo, keeps your hair shiny and healthy looking and have several natural oils that repel insects.</li>
            <li>and my head is itch free.</li>
            <li>Several of my friends are now users and all agree it is great.</li>
            <li>Great for any type of hair especially loc hairstyles.  </li>
            <li>The sensitive skin and allergies lead to flaky scalp and good luck finding a dandruff shampoo without sulfa.</li>
            <li>This shampoo smells so good and the ingredients listed on the bottle are all natural.</li>
            <li>me, the great smell, natural ingredients and reduced amount of oil are worth the frizz.</li>
            <li>So far so good.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like this shampoo; I&#x27;ll stick with Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Liquid Castile Soap, it not only makes a great shampoo, its also great for many other cleaning projects, including brushing your teeth.</li>
            <li>I paid 3x that much!!!</li>
            <li>It gets your hair squeaky clean for a sls free shampoo.</li>
            <li>so apparently, the shampoo wasn&#x27;t good for him either.    </li>
            <li>I was excited to get this conditioner in the mail (I bought the &amp;#34;trader</li>
            <li>Your scalp will feel cleaner and cooler, and you&#x27;ll walk out of the shower with a smile on your face!</li>
            <li>B00068LVUY Original Sprout Hair and Body Wash - 12 oz.]]  </li>
            <li>The fragrance is clean, crisp, and refreshing.</li>
            <li>The shampoo and conditioner smell great - just treelike enough to be fresh and invigorating but not make you smell like a throat lozenge.</li>
            <li>Leaves my hair clean after all the goop I use on it.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t lather up this shampoo, I feel like it doesn&#x27;t get my hair clean, and it does nothing to improve the dandruff situation.</li>
            <li>Smells good and lathers well, especially for a shampoo that is sulfate free.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair feeling clean, without drying out the ends.</li>
            <li>while that shampoo worked, it didn&#x27;t clean my scalp like I thought it should.  </li>
            <li>And my scalp feels clean.</li>
            <li>The idea is to clean hair, not overdry, and not strip oils.</li>
            <li>I knew that adding the shampoo, to boost the effects of the clean and tingly feeling you get after using both.</li>
            <li>My hair/scalp was clean without that dry/squeaky-clean feeling.</li>
            <li>Would most certainly buy again.</li>
            <li>Tingle is right!  </li>
            <li>Love the minty smell and it really gets your hair clean.</li>
            <li>it was all natural and liked the tea tree part bc tea tree is a deterrent for lice .</li>
            <li>My hair stylist told me that maybe these products are stripping too much moisture away from the scalp, causing it to go into overdrive and produce more oil.</li>
            <li>Was ok, but did not give the the tingling sensation I was really hoping for, and the reason I bought this product.</li>
            <li>really does tingle, and I love the feeling.</li>
            <li>shampoo doesn&#x27;t smell medicinal at all, and contains many oils that are apparently very beneficial to the hair and scalp, including tea tree, peppermint, lavender, rosemary, thyme...</li>
            <li>The only good thing about it was that I didn&#x27;t have to pay an arm and a leg for it.</li>
            <li>It clears the oil from my hair nicely, and I have naturally oily hair.</li>
            <li>Not a bad product, but it doesn&#x27;t lather as well as I&#x27;d like.</li>
            <li>Since I&#x27;m a natural Kinky hair girl I try to look for the best ingredients in my products to avoid drying out my already dry hair.</li>
            <li>Like another reviewer posted, I did not get the tingling sensation and am skeptical about ha cleansing properties being very potent, but am happy to support cruelty free products.  </li>
            <li>I believe it is the peppermint that give you the soothing sensation of clean, fresh hair/scalp.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure the product will work better with the conditioner that comes with the line I will definitely review on the conditioner soon.</li>
            <li>one just had a mild tingle to it</li>
            <li>I love this, but you most definitely need to condition your hair afterwards.</li>
            <li>I enjoy the product very much.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall it works, has very minimal health risk ingredients, smells very nice, cleans well, and helps get rid of dandruff.</li>
            <li>Not near as good as the Paul Mitchell tea tree shampoo</li>
            <li>My hair changed a lot while I was pregnant, and I was looking for something that wouldn&#x27;t dry it out, but would do a good job of cleaning my extra-thick hormone-powered mane.</li>
            <li>Oh, its also sulfate free, and about one quarter the cost of the high priced sulfate free products sold in salons.</li>
            <li>It smells strongly like peppermint, and is very invigorating.</li>
            <li>I was going through trader joes and decided to try a all natural shampoo and conditioner, because nature should be able to clean and condition your hair right?</li>
            <li>When I first opened the box, I thought, &amp;#34;MAN!</li>
            <li>Love this shampoo...makes my hair soft and shiny!</li>
            <li>My main concern was that my hair was becoming brittle and breaking.</li>
            <li>I have straight, fine oily hair, and this shampoo gives me scalp pimples.</li>
            <li>(This never happened with my previous shampoo [[ASIN:B001339RX4 Shampoo-Oil &amp; Fragrance Free - 16 oz.]], which I stopped using because the formula kept getting more and more watery.)  </li>
            <li>Trader Joe&#x27;s couldn&#x27;t make a shampoo which had BOTH tea tree oil AND jasmine, japanese cherry blossom, or some other beautiful exotic feminine fragrance.</li>
            <li>but as other reviews said can get at trader joes for $3.99 that with shipping not worth it better to buy paul Mitchell as that one has the best tree oil</li>
            <li>I have tried many products over the years and prefer a natural product.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re natural product junkie like, me you&#x27;ll love the Trader Joes&#x27;s Tea Tree Tingle Shampoo ($3.99).</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t know, sulfate is very drying to the hair its agent is used in most cleaning products, which is why you need so much conditioner after you wash your hair.</li>
            <li>She&#x27;s in elementary school</li>
            <li>I figured, for the price, it wasn&#x27;t worth the hassle.</li>
            <li>I have a fragrance allergy and thought this was a great option - all natural, just a lot of essential oils, nothing seemingly synthetic, nothing on my list of chemicals to avoid.  </li>
            <li>but it is definitely worth the selling price here as well.</li>
            <li>so it is worth it to me.</li>
            <li>I love that it helps keep my itchy, flaky scalp clear.  </li>
            <li>n&#x27;t so it&#x27;s worth trying out.</li>
            <li>I had bought a different brand mint shampoo at Tuesday morning and had liked it.</li>
            <li>I had messed around with homemade shampoo recipes, but did not have success.  </li>
            <li>This gets my fine, thin hair clean and looking great.  </li>
            <li>Love the tingly feeling, and gets hair squeeky clean, but you definitely need to use conditioner after this.</li>
            <li>It is very soothing on the scalp and the fragrances is clean and fresh.  </li>
            <li>I have dandruff from time to time on my scalp and my eyebrows and a wash with this now and then seems to do a fairly good job of clearing it up, and at a fraction of the price of other teatree oil shampoos.</li>
            <li>I love the conditioner very much, but will use if for my daughter&#x27;s natural hair.</li>
            <li>I stopped I using the shampoo right away</li>
            <li>Even at this price I think its a decent value if you need hair products that are sulfate free.  </li>
            <li>This works really well, stops the itching, makes your scalp feel cool &amp; comfy</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo b/c I teach school and little kids love to surprise me w/ a hug where they lay their head on my shoulder or somesuch</li>
            <li>I have pretty itchy skin, and this fixes it right up.  </li>
            <li>quick shipping thanks hope this does what everyone says it will.  </li>
            <li>This is a nice shampoo for dry flakey itchy scalp that doesnt use chemicals to relieve.  </li>
            <li>and it did not dry it out more.  </li>
            <li>The ingredients are natural and easy to pronounce.  </li>
            <li>It cleanses it quite effectively, and leaves it shining, so much so that by the fourth day after shampooing, even with product in my hair and with no time to shampoo, I can wear it up</li>
            <li>When I used the tea tree tingle set, my hair was SO light and soft!</li>
            <li>I like it very much, and it&#x27;s all natural-organic etc etc.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s the sodium laurel sulfates or what in other shampoos, but I just stick with this and enjoy better</li>
            <li>I was initially using pantene before, the fragile to strong kind.</li>
            <li>Once I switched clarifying shampoos (Kinky Curly Come Clean), my curls sprung back to life and were free of their grimy feeling.</li>
            <li>This works really well on my rather oily hair, and leaves my hair very shiny and thoroughly clean.</li>
            <li>would definitely recommend this product to someone, it is fantastic!</li>
            <li>You will notice with the first use.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this shampoo because I thought I was getting a better deal on amazon but come to find out its only like $3.99 at trader joe&#x27;s and there is one in atlanta</li>
            <li>It really does tingle!</li>
            <li>I tried this stuff a few years ago at my brother&#x27;s house and it practically set my scalp on fire-- in a good way.</li>
            <li>I even loved the way my hair felt as I was washing it and after it dried.</li>
            <li>this is a great product for dry curly hair of moderate thickness.  </li>
            <li>It rinsed clan and left my hair feeling very clean but not at all stripped.</li>
            <li>Other than that, it felt amazing in my hair.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I really like this as a cheap (not on amazon), natural shampoo that works well for my skin and hair.  </li>
            <li>The &amp;#34;tingle&amp;#34; is about 2/3 as intense as the PM version, so it can be more of a daily use</li>
            <li>/&gt;The smell is okay, but just a tiny bit weak compared to the Tea Tree shampoo from Great Clips.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t live near a TJ&#x27;s anymore and all the other brands didn&#x27;t work as well - happy to pay price the price to get something quality that works on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>However, even though it contains absolutely NOTHING that I have a proven allergy to, when I skin tested it, it left a bright red rash!</li>
            <li>Product works great on mixed soft curly hair, but with a different conditioner than the tea tree version.</li>
            <li>first off, if you can buy this in store it is much cheaper.</li>
            <li>This pretty much fits the bill.</li>
            <li>I do not do that with this shampoo though because it does have a pretty intense coolness sensation on my scalp</li>
            <li>Long Lasting&lt;br /&gt;+ Tingling/Cooling Feeling makes for a refreshing shower</li>
            <li>Other Tea Tree products have proven to be much more exciting on the scalp.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>I have been plagued with dry, flaking and itchy scalp for over 15 years and have tried every prescription shampoo on the market; been to many dermatologists and nothing helps.</li>
            <li>Because my hair dries easily I won&#x27;t use this daily.</li>
            <li>I like to remove all the product from my hair, but have dry skin and hair and can not shampoo more than every four days.  </li>
            <li>This is a little too clarifying for my hair type, it kind of dries my hair out.</li>
            <li>My stylist said too much protein drys out the hair</li>
            <li>So don&#x27;t get ripped off online and pay this much.</li>
            <li>My roommate really likes it for his beard, though.</li>
            <li>Barely so much as a tickle.  </li>
            <li>I have atopic dermatitis and my scalp can get VERY itchy.</li>
            <li>Even though my scalp was suffering I continued to use the product since it clarified my hair so well and made my wash-n-go&#x27;s look very definded.  </li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>Trader Joe&#x27;s tea tree really cleans my hair</li>
            <li>This shampoo was very drying for my hair.  </li>
            <li>They are actually real peppermint.</li>
            <li>My hair loves it, but my skin...not so much.</li>
            <li>and I am very</li>
            <li>I use this shampoo all the time and really like it...</li>
            <li>(Do I sound like a hair commercial?)</li>
            <li>I would absolutely recommend it and I will continue to buy it.</li>
            <li>I really like the shampoo.</li>
            <li>Thanks...</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t like this product that much at all</li>
            <li>it really didn&#x27;t work for me</li>
            <li>you can really feel the peppermint tingle your head when you use the shampoo.</li>
            <li>Item as described -- fast delivery.</li>
            <li>I think you really just have to give it a try.  </li>
            <li>Amazon is trying to pull a fast one.</li>
            <li>He has a normal, healthy scalp and his skin is not sensitive like mine...</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like to use products that have any unnecessary ingredients just because they make the product foam better, or have a better color, at the cost of putting poison into our bodies.</li>
            <li>My hair was left clean and shiny, tangle-free and soft yet not weighed down, and very lightly scented with the clean outdoor smell of eucalyptus and mint.    </li>
            <li>This is a good product however if you go directly to trader joes, it costs less than 5 bucks a bottle!  </li>
            <li>This shampoo didn&#x27;t work any better than any other shampoo that I have used.  </li>
            <li>Definitely leaves your hair and scalp feeling clean and refreshed.</li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t do enough to actually clean</li>
            <li>I was looking for something to help with my itchy scalp, it definitely gets your hair squeaky clean, i didnt feel the tingle everyone is talking about.</li>
            <li>For $3.99, if you live within driving distance of a Trader Joe&#x27;s, it is worth a try if you are in search of something for sensitive scalp and/or dandruff</li>
            <li>The scent is actually not bad, especially considering the fact that I don&#x27;t like the smell of tea tree oil</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s rich, it doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair, and it really cleans.  </li>
            <li>I checked the ingredients and they more than measure up to the other natural products I have used - not quite as pure/organic as the shampoo bars I have used, but liquid is so much easier to use.</li>
            <li>Nice sulfate free shampoo, however it less than half the online price if you go to a Trader Joe&#x27;s store.  </li>
            <li>Since I&#x27;ve been using this Shampoo, my scalp is no longer dry, itchy, and I&#x27;m dandruff free.</li>
            <li>Instead I have been using it mainly for clarifying purposes once a week</li>
            <li>Paul Mitchell Tea Tree Shampoo is way better; however, a lot more expensive.  </li>
            <li>It does tingle but mainly if it gets on my face.</li>
            <li>I also have Scalp Seborrhea which is one of the main causes of dandruff.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend if you have my type of hair,</li>
            <li>Highly recommended for anyone using head and shoulders or anything of the like</li>
            <li>I recommend highly try it</li>
            <li>Why is the price so high here?</li>
            <li>When I came upon Trader Joe&#x27;s Tea Tree Tingle Shampoo, at only $3.99 with natural ingredients, I was so excited to try it.    </li>
            <li>Even though it claims to be all natural, there is definitely something in it that is not so friendly to me.</li>
            <li>I agree with a previous comment, this shampoo is very week , not enough to feel any kind of tingling sensation that you would normally feel with a shampoo that contains peppermint.</li>
            <li>I bought this from Trader Joe&#x27;s and was hoping it would be a great shampoo, but I was wrong.</li>
            <li>I have naturally oily skin and scalp, so I&#x27;m very prone to pimples and dandruff.</li>
            <li>I was surprised, but when I switched to this, my skin really cleared up.  </li>
            <li>like i normally do.</li>
            <li>I feel like I have to use a lot of it, like using a normal amount</li>
            <li>Looking for an economical alternative to similar Paul Mitchell products and found it with TJ Tee Tree shampoo.  </li>
            <li>i use this to gently bathe my hair and follow up with good dollop of the extra thick and creamy conditioner.  </li>
            <li>No more dry itchy scalp and my hair feel smooth and healthy.</li>
            <li>The shampoo lathered just enough to cleanse easily without creating a big cloud of foam like the SLS-containing shampoos that will ruin your hair will.</li>
            <li>Bottles are big and the prise is right.</li>
            <li>It has similar effect to Icy Hot or Ben Gay.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a fine shampoo and conditioner but not in the same league or even same galaxy as the Paul Mitchell one.</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t leave any residue on my scalp like other overpriced sulfate free shampoos do.</li>
            <li>It can dry your hair depending on your hair type (works fine on my husband&#x27;s naturally oily hair but dries my naturally medium-dry hair) and doesn&#x27;t help at all with dandruff.</li>
            <li>This is my new go-to product for the winter.</li>
            <li>I literally live across the street from a Trader Joe&#x27;s, so I walked over there and bought it.</li>
            <li>We don&#x27;t have a trader Joe&#x27;s where I live.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know (and for the latter, I certainly hope not!).  </li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair, and that&#x27;s mainly the way I wear my hair.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>using it my daughters scalp has been very sensitive to the touch.</li>
            <li>The eucalyptus smell is very soft.</li>
            <li>My husband has very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>And wow was I pleasantly surprised!!  </li>
            <li>It is a natural product, very thick, so you don&#x27;t need as much of the product to get a nice lather.</li>
            <li>Usually I am able to use shampoos with small amounts of sulfa products in them</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>Be aware with essential oils for allergies.</li>
            <li>/&gt;As shampoos go, this is pretty basic.</li>
            <li>a Trader Joe&#x27;s near you!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Edited to add that the Original Sprout not only doesn&#x27;t spot the shower curtain, it eventually cleaned away the spots left by the Trader Joe&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>WOW!</li>
            <li>I strongly recommend this product to anyone suffering from dry scalp and dandruff, it is the only thing that has worked and now I can&#x27;t imagine using anything else.  </li>
            <li>Also, it is possible to be allergic to some of the other natural oils in the product, so make sure you aren&#x27;t allergic to any of the ingredients.&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you live anywhere near a store, buy it in person.</li>
            <li>Getting this shampoo in your eyes is probably one of the worse sensations I&#x27;ve experienced while taking a shower in a long time.</li>
            <li>After just a few days using this product I have noticed a huge difference in my hair and scalp.</li>
            <li>It would&#x27;ve been 5 stars had it not dried my hair out so much with daily use.</li>
            <li>Helped clear up my daughter&#x27;s dandruff and she loves the smell.</li>
            <li>If your hair is protein sensitive</li>
            <li>I thought maybe I was using too much, and tried using a smaller amount, but it did not help.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Two stars for being all natural, and I did like the shampoo.</li>
            <li>I guess I&#x27;m just sensitive to Tea Tree Oil.</li>
            <li>If you have sensitive skin stay far away from this product.</li>
            <li>Here, it costs nearly three times the price in a the company&#x27;s store, however.</li>
            <li>If there&#x27;s a Trader Joe&#x27;s near you, go get some.</li>
            <li>I have a sulfa allergy and nearly all mass marketed shampoos in the U.S. have some type if sulfa derivative in them.</li>
            <li>Only produces a light &amp;#34;tingling&amp;#34; sensation if left on your scalp for several minutes.  </li>
            <li>People complain about this being very striping but don&#x27;t realize that it&#x27;s actually a clarifying shampoo</li>
            <li>it does its job and its all natural and  </li>
            <li>However, after using it for a week or two I noticed that my scalp was getting itchy, and just recently I developed some itchy bumps in areas where the shampoo ran off when rinsing, e.g., the side of my neck and my torso.  </li>
            <li>I had a reaction like this before to another mint-based, natural shampoo (something I found at my co-op).  </li>
            <li>but without stripping it completely of its natural oils-</li>
            <li>it makes my somewhat naturally curly hair curlier&lt;</li>
            <li>This shampoo makes my gray hair really soft.  </li>
            <li>but since there isn&#x27;t a trader joe&#x27;s near by</li>
            <li>never knew a natural shampoo/conditioner could make</li>
            <li>/&gt;Trader Joe&#x27;s also has a gallon of Aloe Vera gel for $7.99 for the natural hair enthusiasts out there.</li>
            <li>I read reviews that this makes their hair brittle - well - yes, as there are no silicones or synthetic ingredients - its all natural products - just meant to cleanse.</li>
            <li>Not by itself very harmful to health unless you have allergies, but it also has contaminates in it such as NITROSAMINES which is carcinogenic (Radiocative, an cause</li>
            <li>I really like how this makes my hair feel, but additionally, it doesn&#x27;t cause breakouts on my shoulders like commercial hair products seem to for me.  </li>
            <li>Does not sulfate laureate which strips your hair of the natural oils.  </li>
            <li>I love the smell and it creates a thick lather.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice, big bottle for the price and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>In fact, my scalp got more itchy and where the shampoo came dripping down on the sides of my face, a red rash with bumps developed, same happened to the nape of my neck.</li>
            <li>I use it with a very small amount of marine biological conditioner (not on the roots), and I&#x27;m the happiest I&#x27;ve been with a shampoo in many years.  </li>
            <li>I really disliked the scent at first, but now it doesn&#x27;t bother me as much.</li>
            <li>I normally follow up with the tree tee conditioner which will bring the soft silky feeling back into your hair.</li>
            <li>This is one of the shampoos that is natural and gentle enough that I can actually use it without having my skin</li>
            <li>I was really looking forward to this shampoo as a change from Head and Shoulders to help with dry scalp and dandruff.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair soft after using and not dry and strawlike.  </li>
            <li>So on to the conditioner, it was not too thick, so easy to get out of the bottle.</li>
            <li>My husband decided to try the TJ shampoo and after 3 days of daily usage, he developed some flaking.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t lather very well at all, and it&#x27;s not very cleansing.&lt;br</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m careful not to use that much in one shampooing) to scare away lice and kills bacteria &amp; fungi and also prevents dandruff and an itchy scalp.  </li>
            <li>Tea tree oil is a homeopathic treatment for dandruff and this shampoo is actually organic with natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a natural I have locs and not only does it tingle and moisturize my scalp</li>
            <li>This is a natural cleansing shampoo - for only $4 in the store.</li>
            <li>This will not make hair soft - it is only meant to cleanse.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t use it on colored hair because of this deep cleansing action.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a person who likes to only use all natural products.</li>
            <li>If I use this, it would have to be mixed with an all natural conditioner.</li>
            <li>American natural</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t get barely any of a tingle sensation.</li>
            <li>And, rest assured, I do not have an exaggerated memory of what I tried years ago-- honest.</li>
            <li>we had a run of lice go through our house, and have been devoted to varying tea tree products since then, as tea tree oil is a wonderful lice repellent.  </li>
            <li>I have very dry thick but fine straight red hair prone to tangling.</li>
            <li>Possibly the mint is too strong for my skin, at least on my scalp.  </li>
            <li>My only negative is that the peppermint scent is really strong and stings your eyes...</li>
            <li>Apparently tea tree oil is a natural lice repellent and this is a nice way for kids to keep clean over the summer.  </li>
            <li>Since I use natural products I tend to be lazy and use shampoo as body wash sometimes and don&#x27;t worry about it too much since it&#x27;s all natural.</li>
            <li>although its pricey on Amazon, its still cheaper than other sulfate free shampoos that leaves residue in your hair and comes in less ounces.</li>
            <li>I went to trader&#x27;s joe looking for a shampoo that was paraben free and this shampoo was the only one (at least in my store).</li>
            <li>I am and African American woman with natural hair.  </li>
            <li>I am African American natural.</li>
            <li>This product (with my experiences) does not aid in natural African American hair.</li>
            <li>My scalp is never dry or itchy after using it, AND it&#x27;s sulfate-free.</li>
            <li>It removes all the product and does not dry out my hair.  </li>
            <li>It does not dry your hair and it doesn&#x27;t make it oily either.</li>
            <li>but I haven&#x27;t noticed this so apparently there isn&#x27;t enough protein to make that happen in my case.  </li>
            <li>Lately, I&#x27;ve been trying to take matters into my own hands and started looking for shampoos with the LEAST amount or NO CHEMICALS, just natural hair care.</li>
            <li>and after a few uses my head didn&#x27;t itch for literally the first time in months.  </li>
            <li>It also immediately helped clear up my dry scalp.</li>
            <li>My hair is soft to the touch and my curls are defined at long last.  </li>
            <li>It was super thick, I had to dilute it.</li>
            <li>The natural shampoos and conditioners I have used tend to be pretty expensive, sometimes as much as $17/bottle.</li>
            <li>Not so much on natural coarse dry hair.</li>
            <li>And the peppermint oil lends a refreshing scent that both perked me up on tired mornings and helped soothe dry or congested sinuses during the winter months.</li>
            <li>I purchased some here and sent it to a relative who does not live near a Trader Joe&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>Usually with sulfate free shampoos I expect the difficulty to lather and some runniness, but this one was on the extreme for both.</li>
            <li>The lack of normal shampoo ingredients such as all the sulfates and other chemicals combined with the tea tree oil has done wonders for the skin on my neck and back, clearing up moderate acne.</li>

            <li> but I seem to have found a great shampoo/conditioner combination that won&#x27;t send me to the poorhouse.</li>

            <li> Cost more but is awesome</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t believe I never checked Trader Joe&#x27;s and happy I did and at an great price for something that&#x27;s better than Giovanni!</li>
            <li> I liked it, it lathers well, rinses well and smells great, and it is affordable</li>
            <li> feels so good and luxurious.</li>
            <li> THE SHAMPOO IS GOOD AND</li>
            <li> My scalp feels good the day</li>
            <li> Good but Tue product at TJ&#x27;s is $4 vs. $10</li>
            <li> Yes, Trader Joes is good with food</li>
            <li> It smells nice and makes a great bubble bath.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is good for the price.  </li>
            <li> When I washed my hair, I loved the scent and the tingle.</li>
            <li> I loved the smell and feel of this shampoo.</li>
            <li> I have used all kinds of dandruff shampoo &amp; have never had good results.  </li>
            <li> also sometimes use it as a body wash, and it&#x27;s just as good there.</li>
            <li> Scent is good.</li>
            <li> my (coarse/straight) hair look and feel so good.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s a good product</li>
            <li> I have heard good things about this brand.</li>
            <li> arrived in good time.</li>
            <li> Suds are good but did not do a thing for the itching.</li>
            <li> Loved it when I tried it while visiting my brother.  </li>
            <li> As soon as used this product,we would not get any dandruff.&lt;br /&gt;Overall its a good product</li>
            <li> This is a good shampoo.  </li>
            <li> My husband did use it once for his beard (lol) &amp; liked it.</li>
            <li> I tried it once, the feeling is that it is good</li>
            <li> good shampoo.</li>
            <li> I thinks its good to use maybe once or twice a month to get all the mousse, oils, pomades or whatever you use completley out of your hair, I&#x27;ve started putting tea tree oil on my scalp and let it sit for a while or overnight and the itchyness has diminished</li>
            <li> It is all that it was promised to be and the price was good.</li>
            <li> I ran out to Trader Joe&#x27;s to buy both the shampoo and conditioner based on all the good reviews.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to miss the way it makes my hair look, but what looks good does not always feel good and is not always good for you.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product, with true benefits for anyone suffering from eczema or dandruff.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The shampoo has a cool tingly feeling too and smells wonderful.</li>
            <li> Nice clean tingle, wonderful smell.</li>
            <li> It feels great and refreshing after using this product, so I wouldn&#x27;t mind purchasing it again.</li>
            <li> I had read amazing things about it, I love Trader Joe&#x27;s and the price was great ($3.99).</li>
            <li> I went for a hair cut and the stylist said my hair was very healthy and asked what kind of shampoo I use</li>
            <li> So tingly and refreshing!  </li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> u will be satisfied!</li>
            <li> I just love the scents of tea tree oil and lavender!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to order more because now my mom is using it!</li>
            <li> If you love the feel of mint and a chill, then spend the money to bring this product home!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> Be sure to use a conditioner afterwards!</li>
            <li> love the scent!</li>
            <li> It smells great, I get a good clean without drying my hair or fading my henna.</li>
            <li> or whenever my hair feels like it is in need of a good clean.&lt;br /&gt;Tingly and great smelling, I also used this with the conditioner which was pretty good as well.&lt;br /&gt;Picked</li>
            <li> And yes, it really tingles!!!!!  </li>
            <li> This shampoo smells amazing and does give a nice tingling feeling.</li>
            <li> and it smells amazing.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s amazing for when you have product build up</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s amazing with the conditioner that goes with it</li>
            <li> It detangled my hair nicely.</li>
            <li> It does have a nice earthy scent though which I liked.</li>
            <li> It does have the nice tingle/cooling effect.</li>
            <li> but it is just refreshing, not damaging, it also smells good after.</li>
            <li> IT KIND OF A WAIST</li>
            <li> Nice lather.</li>
            <li> you won&#x27;t haft to make your own home made clarifying shampoo</li>
            <li> This makes a nice foamy bubble bath</li>
            <li> Smells nice and feels nice on the skin, however.</li>
            <li> ok- not as good as pm</li>
            <li> This is not the kind of shampoo where you&#x27;re gonna experience tingling smells immediately.</li>
            <li> Nice  </li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t use it all the time, as it would be too harsh, but is perfect for removing excess buildup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those who have oily hair - this would be perfect.</li>
            <li> This time the smell was nice</li>
            <li> Smells nice.</li>
            <li> This is a nice compromise.</li>
            <li> liked the way it smells and the way it made my hair look and feel, but....</li>
            <li> It was great and made my scalp feel so clean.</li>
            <li> great scent, helps with scalp itching and leaves my hair clean and shiny.  </li>
            <li> I was looking for a cheaper tea tree oil shampoo but still effective with natural and good non-cheap-synthetic-toxic-chemicals quality ingredients in it and found it at Trader Joe&#x27;s and this shampoo was purrrfect!!  </li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t like a minty smell, probably not for you, as it is a very strong scent.</li>
            <li> While the smell and clean feeling is really nice, this shampoo is so clarifying that it dries my hair out!  </li>
            <li> It smells wonderful and leaves your hair feeling fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> Even though the Tea Tree Tingle is cheap, it is still good quality, which I am amazed about.</li>
            <li> I am loving this shampoo and am so glad I ran across the review for it.</li>
            <li> if I had paiud $3, I would have liked it a lot better.</li>
            <li> Awesome tingly shampoo, I guess if there isn&#x27;t a Trader Joe&#x27;s near you</li>
            <li> After using this shampoo, I must use a good conditioner, as it will be SQUEAKY clean.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo it smells great and leaves your scalp feeling tingly and fresh.</li>
            <li> Nice shampoo love peppermint in any product just love how it tingles and cleans my hair just using one wash.</li>
            <li> This is a good product; makes your hair soft and a great feeling on the scalp.  </li>
            <li> My head gets really hot when I&#x27;m sweating with my hair in a ponytail, and being able to scrub this shampoo in and feel like my scalp is standing on a mountain singing with Julie Andrews is a great after-gym treat.</li>
            <li> I was so happy to not feel itchy at all, and plus my curly long hair started to look great and bouncy and healthy again.  </li>
            <li> Once on the scalp, the wash provides a cooling/tingling sensation that is very refreshing and provides a clean</li>
            <li> I only use it to wash my scalp, and it&#x27;s the best.</li>
            <li> i love this shampoo.  </li>
            <li> Love the way it feels, if you have colored hair it will strip your color if you use a lot.</li>
            <li> I also love the ingredients.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many shampoos and conditioners, from Maroccan Oil, to Bumble to Bumble to Pantene to Redkin.</li>
            <li> My husband and I LOVE this shampoo</li>
            <li> After two uses, I love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I usually love all Trader Joe&#x27;s beauty products</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is one of the most cost effective tea tree shampoos available --- when purchased in a retail outlet.</li>
            <li> I love the way this shampoo tingles on my scalp</li>
            <li> I am so glad I purchased this.</li>
            <li> is light but effective.  </li>
            <li> Just not my favorite product of theirs.</li>
            <li> I love the invigorating feel.</li>
            <li> Have added it to our subscription service, so we never run out. :)</li>
            <li> Boy am I glad I read the reviews before ordering.</li>
            <li> Tingly and refreshing</li>
            <li> and personally I think this is the best clarifying shampoo cause</li>
            <li> Yes the price on Amazon is 6 to 7 dollars more than Trader Joes</li>
            <li> I wanted to love this product.</li>
            <li> Peppermint shampoo is a family favorite.  </li>
            <li> I love this shampoo.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t irritate my scalp like most shampoos do.  </li>
            <li> This is my favorite shampoo.</li>
            <li> my hair is more prone to frizz when I use this product</li>
            <li> Will continue to use for sure.</li>
            <li> It is ok.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo.</li>
            <li> i love that this shampoo have no laurel/laureth sulfates in it.</li>
            <li> I just love tea tree oil shampoos and this one is no exception.</li>
            <li> and I love the organic ingredients in it.</li>
            <li> It is more clarifying in a gentle way, and sets you up for a great conditioning treatment.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s enjoyable nonetheless.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, it does have a very noticeable &amp;#34;tingle,&amp;#34; it has a minty scent that men would like as well and works great for clarifying.</li>
            <li> Somehow guys like this smell.. he was very happy with the product and washes his hair everyday because it makes him feel good..</li>
            <li> but I would gladly pay $11 w/prime if I had to.</li>
            <li> but it is better than nothing.</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair feeling really refreshing.</li>
            <li> Also, I love the \\&quot;clean\\&quot; feeling you get.</li>
            <li> I love the way my hair shines and scalp feels because of the eucalyptus / organic ingredients.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo.</li>
            <li> and I just love it.</li>
            <li> &amp; I love the tingle</li>
            <li> I love</li>
            <li> love the refreshing sensation on my scalp.</li>
            <li> I love the tingling feeling</li>
            <li> but they did have the nourish love the nourish.</li>
            <li> First the smell of this shampoo is amazing!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried any more drastic measures yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is the shampoo I&#x27;m using now, and I like the smell and feel even better -</li>
            <li> I find it interesting that virtually all of them have been voted \\&quot;not</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo, it smells good and does exactly what it says it will do.</li>
            <li> Great product would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Gets hair very clean.</li>
            <li> I loved this shampoo at first.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the money!!</li>
            <li> It is not my favorite, but it is indeed a go to for a fresh clean feel and on days when there&#x27;s buildup -- tea tree oil is good for that.  </li>
            <li> Just make sure you rinse properly is most important.</li>
            <li> I would definitely buy this again as it has a great smell and a nice tingle feeling.  </li>
            <li> think it is a great deal for a natural product.</li>
            <li> Even most sulfate free shampoos have sulfonamides.</li>
            <li> I love the tingle and light scent, and the &amp;#34;no animal testing&amp;#34; aspects.  </li>
            <li> I love the minty tingle of this shampoo and the way it cools your scalp, a nice touch after a sweaty workout or on a hot day.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fantastic, and I personally love using it after the gym.</li>
            <li> But it does a great job of cleaning your hair and leaves it soft.</li>
            <li> This product is great, natural ingredients peppermint, tea tree oil etc.</li>
            <li> &quot; considering that most are quite detailed and, to me, helpful.  </li>
            <li> I always thought you had to spend so much in order for your hair to look and feel good.</li>
            <li> Kinda watery consistency that requires too much product to get a good lather going.</li>
            <li> Good quality shampoos aren&#x27;t supposed to lather much and this one does</li>
            <li> Good product, shipped fast.  </li>
            <li> I love how natural it is and the smell is really pleasant (not too strong).</li>
            <li> you don&#x27;t have a TJ&#x27;s near you, I suggest you check out Nature&#x27;s Gate Tea Tree Shampoo... which is also very nice:  </li>
            <li> I have no problems producing a rich lather, it just has to be worked at a bit more.</li>
            <li> I really liked the shampoo and liked that it contained natural ingredients</li>
            <li> They were very quick in shipping as well.</li>
            <li> Love the clean feeling I get from using this shampoo.  </li>
            <li> The peppermint in the shampoo and condition is strong and gives you a tingle in your scalp</li>
            <li> I love Trader Joe&#x27;s, but I&#x27;m using twice as much shampoo just to work up a lather, so I&#x27;m not finding it cost effective.  </li>
            <li> Strongly recommend</li>
            <li> Not as strong as I hoped</li>
            <li> Very clean and smells nice too, does have a good deep clean to Trader Joe&#x27;s</li>
            <li> Great sulfate free, paraben free all natural shampoo.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This one lathers nicely, and is gentle on my kiddos hair!  </li>
            <li> I ended up using the other bottle with my foot brush to scrub my feet, which was perfect because I could enjoy the peppermint scent, and my feet didn&#x27;t react to the product.  </li>
            <li> Not a bad price, hear it&#x27;s even better at</li>
            <li> This tea tree shampoo is not harsh as some others are, and the smell is not too strong; it is quite pleasant.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t tell if this one spots until I either clean the shower curtain successfully or get a new one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My hair is wavy and fine.</li>
            <li> They didn&#x27;t have chemical based hair products a hundred years ago, and people were doing just fine without it.   </li>
            <li> Otherwise the shampoo was fine.</li>
            <li> it does the job just fine</li>
            <li> Great product...just as advertised...I would highly recommend this hair product..and it was shipped fast and safe in a baggy just in case an accident happened</li>
            <li> I really love the minty smell of the shampoo, and it lathered up pretty well and seemed to clean my hair OK.  </li>
            <li> Then I found the Trader Joe&#x27;s brand, and thought, this is great, practically the same ingredients for a fraction of the price ($3.99 at the store).</li>
            <li> I guess that is what you get getting cheap hair products at the pharmacy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve continued to use the product because I bought 5 bottles of it so that I could get free shipping</li>
            <li> Overall, a great value.</li>
            <li> and we really can&#x27;t afford that kind of expense.</li>
            <li> Nice scent, and cleans my hair really well.</li>
            <li> The peppermint scent is great in fact will open your sinus&#x27; while washing your hair.</li>
            <li> This is a great basic, non toxic product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> also like TJ&#x27;s Tea Tree conditioner... light on the hair, without being overpowering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Plus the price is fantastic.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because trader joes doesn&#x27;t test on animals and that is important to me.</li>
            <li> Awesome Shampoo, keeps your hair shiny and healthy looking and have several natural oils that repel insects.</li>
            <li> and my head is itch free.</li>
            <li> Several of my friends are now users and all agree it is great.</li>
            <li> Great for any type of hair especially loc hairstyles.  </li>
            <li> The sensitive skin and allergies lead to flaky scalp and good luck finding a dandruff shampoo without sulfa.</li>
            <li> This shampoo smells so good and the ingredients listed on the bottle are all natural.</li>
            <li> me, the great smell, natural ingredients and reduced amount of oil are worth the frizz.</li>
            <li> So far so good.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like this shampoo; I&#x27;ll stick with Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Liquid Castile Soap, it not only makes a great shampoo, its also great for many other cleaning projects, including brushing your teeth.</li>
            <li> I paid 3x that much!!!</li>
            <li> It gets your hair squeaky clean for a sls free shampoo.</li>
            <li> so apparently, the shampoo wasn&#x27;t good for him either.    </li>
            <li> I was excited to get this conditioner in the mail (I bought the &amp;#34;trader</li>
            <li> Your scalp will feel cleaner and cooler, and you&#x27;ll walk out of the shower with a smile on your face!</li>
            <li> B00068LVUY Original Sprout Hair and Body Wash - 12 oz.]]  </li>
            <li> The fragrance is clean, crisp, and refreshing.</li>
            <li> The shampoo and conditioner smell great - just treelike enough to be fresh and invigorating but not make you smell like a throat lozenge.</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair clean after all the goop I use on it.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t lather up this shampoo, I feel like it doesn&#x27;t get my hair clean, and it does nothing to improve the dandruff situation.</li>
            <li> Smells good and lathers well, especially for a shampoo that is sulfate free.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair feeling clean, without drying out the ends.</li>
            <li> while that shampoo worked, it didn&#x27;t clean my scalp like I thought it should.  </li>
            <li> And my scalp feels clean.</li>
            <li> The idea is to clean hair, not overdry, and not strip oils.</li>
            <li> I knew that adding the shampoo, to boost the effects of the clean and tingly feeling you get after using both.</li>
            <li> My hair/scalp was clean without that dry/squeaky-clean feeling.</li>
            <li> Would most certainly buy again.</li>
            <li> Tingle is right!  </li>
            <li> Love the minty smell and it really gets your hair clean.</li>
            <li> it was all natural and liked the tea tree part bc tea tree is a deterrent for lice .</li>
            <li> My hair stylist told me that maybe these products are stripping too much moisture away from the scalp, causing it to go into overdrive and produce more oil.</li>
            <li> Was ok, but did not give the the tingling sensation I was really hoping for, and the reason I bought this product.</li>
            <li> really does tingle, and I love the feeling.</li>
            <li> shampoo doesn&#x27;t smell medicinal at all, and contains many oils that are apparently very beneficial to the hair and scalp, including tea tree, peppermint, lavender, rosemary, thyme...</li>
            <li> The only good thing about it was that I didn&#x27;t have to pay an arm and a leg for it.</li>
            <li> It clears the oil from my hair nicely, and I have naturally oily hair.</li>
            <li> Not a bad product, but it doesn&#x27;t lather as well as I&#x27;d like.</li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;m a natural Kinky hair girl I try to look for the best ingredients in my products to avoid drying out my already dry hair.</li>
            <li> Like another reviewer posted, I did not get the tingling sensation and am skeptical about ha cleansing properties being very potent, but am happy to support cruelty free products.  </li>
            <li> I believe it is the peppermint that give you the soothing sensation of clean, fresh hair/scalp.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure the product will work better with the conditioner that comes with the line I will definitely review on the conditioner soon.</li>
            <li> one just had a mild tingle to it</li>
            <li> I love this, but you most definitely need to condition your hair afterwards.</li>
            <li> I enjoy the product very much.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall it works, has very minimal health risk ingredients, smells very nice, cleans well, and helps get rid of dandruff.</li>
            <li> Not near as good as the Paul Mitchell tea tree shampoo</li>
            <li> My hair changed a lot while I was pregnant, and I was looking for something that wouldn&#x27;t dry it out, but would do a good job of cleaning my extra-thick hormone-powered mane.</li>
            <li> Oh, its also sulfate free, and about one quarter the cost of the high priced sulfate free products sold in salons.</li>
            <li> It smells strongly like peppermint, and is very invigorating.</li>
            <li> I was going through trader joes and decided to try a all natural shampoo and conditioner, because nature should be able to clean and condition your hair right?</li>
            <li> When I first opened the box, I thought, &amp;#34;MAN!</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo...makes my hair soft and shiny!</li>
            <li> My main concern was that my hair was becoming brittle and breaking.</li>
            <li> I have straight, fine oily hair, and this shampoo gives me scalp pimples.</li>
            <li> (This never happened with my previous shampoo [[ASIN:B001339RX4 Shampoo-Oil &amp; Fragrance Free - 16 oz.]], which I stopped using because the formula kept getting more and more watery.)  </li>
            <li> Trader Joe&#x27;s couldn&#x27;t make a shampoo which had BOTH tea tree oil AND jasmine, japanese cherry blossom, or some other beautiful exotic feminine fragrance.</li>
            <li> but as other reviews said can get at trader joes for $3.99 that with shipping not worth it better to buy paul Mitchell as that one has the best tree oil</li>
            <li> I have tried many products over the years and prefer a natural product.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re natural product junkie like, me you&#x27;ll love the Trader Joes&#x27;s Tea Tree Tingle Shampoo ($3.99).</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t know, sulfate is very drying to the hair its agent is used in most cleaning products, which is why you need so much conditioner after you wash your hair.</li>
            <li> She&#x27;s in elementary school</li>
            <li> I figured, for the price, it wasn&#x27;t worth the hassle.</li>
            <li> I have a fragrance allergy and thought this was a great option - all natural, just a lot of essential oils, nothing seemingly synthetic, nothing on my list of chemicals to avoid.  </li>
            <li> but it is definitely worth the selling price here as well.</li>
            <li> so it is worth it to me.</li>
            <li> I love that it helps keep my itchy, flaky scalp clear.  </li>
            <li> n&#x27;t so it&#x27;s worth trying out.</li>
            <li> I had bought a different brand mint shampoo at Tuesday morning and had liked it.</li>
            <li> I had messed around with homemade shampoo recipes, but did not have success.  </li>
            <li> This gets my fine, thin hair clean and looking great.  </li>
            <li> Love the tingly feeling, and gets hair squeeky clean, but you definitely need to use conditioner after this.</li>
            <li> It is very soothing on the scalp and the fragrances is clean and fresh.  </li>
            <li> I have dandruff from time to time on my scalp and my eyebrows and a wash with this now and then seems to do a fairly good job of clearing it up, and at a fraction of the price of other teatree oil shampoos.</li>
            <li> I love the conditioner very much, but will use if for my daughter&#x27;s natural hair.</li>
            <li> I stopped I using the shampoo right away</li>
            <li> Even at this price I think its a decent value if you need hair products that are sulfate free.  </li>
            <li> This works really well, stops the itching, makes your scalp feel cool &amp; comfy</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo b/c I teach school and little kids love to surprise me w/ a hug where they lay their head on my shoulder or somesuch</li>
            <li> I have pretty itchy skin, and this fixes it right up.  </li>
            <li> quick shipping thanks hope this does what everyone says it will.  </li>
            <li> This is a nice shampoo for dry flakey itchy scalp that doesnt use chemicals to relieve.  </li>
            <li> and it did not dry it out more.  </li>
            <li> The ingredients are natural and easy to pronounce.  </li>
            <li> It cleanses it quite effectively, and leaves it shining, so much so that by the fourth day after shampooing, even with product in my hair and with no time to shampoo, I can wear it up</li>
            <li> When I used the tea tree tingle set, my hair was SO light and soft!</li>
            <li> I like it very much, and it&#x27;s all natural-organic etc etc.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s the sodium laurel sulfates or what in other shampoos, but I just stick with this and enjoy better</li>
            <li> I was initially using pantene before, the fragile to strong kind.</li>
            <li> Once I switched clarifying shampoos (Kinky Curly Come Clean), my curls sprung back to life and were free of their grimy feeling.</li>
            <li> This works really well on my rather oily hair, and leaves my hair very shiny and thoroughly clean.</li>
            <li> would definitely recommend this product to someone, it is fantastic!</li>
            <li> You will notice with the first use.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this shampoo because I thought I was getting a better deal on amazon but come to find out its only like $3.99 at trader joe&#x27;s and there is one in atlanta</li>
            <li> It really does tingle!</li>
            <li> I tried this stuff a few years ago at my brother&#x27;s house and it practically set my scalp on fire-- in a good way.</li>
            <li> I even loved the way my hair felt as I was washing it and after it dried.</li>
            <li> this is a great product for dry curly hair of moderate thickness.  </li>
            <li> It rinsed clan and left my hair feeling very clean but not at all stripped.</li>
            <li> Other than that, it felt amazing in my hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I really like this as a cheap (not on amazon), natural shampoo that works well for my skin and hair.  </li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;tingle&amp;#34; is about 2/3 as intense as the PM version, so it can be more of a daily use</li>
            <li> /&gt;The smell is okay, but just a tiny bit weak compared to the Tea Tree shampoo from Great Clips.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t live near a TJ&#x27;s anymore and all the other brands didn&#x27;t work as well - happy to pay price the price to get something quality that works on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> However, even though it contains absolutely NOTHING that I have a proven allergy to, when I skin tested it, it left a bright red rash!</li>
            <li> Product works great on mixed soft curly hair, but with a different conditioner than the tea tree version.</li>
            <li> first off, if you can buy this in store it is much cheaper.</li>
            <li> This pretty much fits the bill.</li>
            <li> I do not do that with this shampoo though because it does have a pretty intense coolness sensation on my scalp</li>
            <li> Long Lasting&lt;br /&gt;+ Tingling/Cooling Feeling makes for a refreshing shower</li>
            <li> Other Tea Tree products have proven to be much more exciting on the scalp.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> I have been plagued with dry, flaking and itchy scalp for over 15 years and have tried every prescription shampoo on the market; been to many dermatologists and nothing helps.</li>
            <li> Because my hair dries easily I won&#x27;t use this daily.</li>
            <li> I like to remove all the product from my hair, but have dry skin and hair and can not shampoo more than every four days.  </li>
            <li> This is a little too clarifying for my hair type, it kind of dries my hair out.</li>
            <li> My stylist said too much protein drys out the hair</li>
            <li> So don&#x27;t get ripped off online and pay this much.</li>
            <li> My roommate really likes it for his beard, though.</li>
            <li> Barely so much as a tickle.  </li>
            <li> I have atopic dermatitis and my scalp can get VERY itchy.</li>
            <li> Even though my scalp was suffering I continued to use the product since it clarified my hair so well and made my wash-n-go&#x27;s look very definded.  </li>
            <li> I really like it.</li>
            <li> Trader Joe&#x27;s tea tree really cleans my hair</li>
            <li> This shampoo was very drying for my hair.  </li>
            <li> They are actually real peppermint.</li>
            <li> My hair loves it, but my skin...not so much.</li>
            <li> and I am very</li>
            <li> I use this shampoo all the time and really like it...</li>
            <li> (Do I sound like a hair commercial?)</li>
            <li> I would absolutely recommend it and I will continue to buy it.</li>
            <li> I really like the shampoo.</li>
            <li> Thanks...</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like this product that much at all</li>
            <li> it really didn&#x27;t work for me</li>
            <li> you can really feel the peppermint tingle your head when you use the shampoo.</li>
            <li> Item as described -- fast delivery.</li>
            <li> I think you really just have to give it a try.  </li>
            <li> Amazon is trying to pull a fast one.</li>
            <li> He has a normal, healthy scalp and his skin is not sensitive like mine...</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like to use products that have any unnecessary ingredients just because they make the product foam better, or have a better color, at the cost of putting poison into our bodies.</li>
            <li> My hair was left clean and shiny, tangle-free and soft yet not weighed down, and very lightly scented with the clean outdoor smell of eucalyptus and mint.    </li>
            <li> This is a good product however if you go directly to trader joes, it costs less than 5 bucks a bottle!  </li>
            <li> This shampoo didn&#x27;t work any better than any other shampoo that I have used.  </li>
            <li> Definitely leaves your hair and scalp feeling clean and refreshed.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t do enough to actually clean</li>
            <li> I was looking for something to help with my itchy scalp, it definitely gets your hair squeaky clean, i didnt feel the tingle everyone is talking about.</li>
            <li> For $3.99, if you live within driving distance of a Trader Joe&#x27;s, it is worth a try if you are in search of something for sensitive scalp and/or dandruff</li>
            <li> The scent is actually not bad, especially considering the fact that I don&#x27;t like the smell of tea tree oil</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s rich, it doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair, and it really cleans.  </li>
            <li> I checked the ingredients and they more than measure up to the other natural products I have used - not quite as pure/organic as the shampoo bars I have used, but liquid is so much easier to use.</li>
            <li> Nice sulfate free shampoo, however it less than half the online price if you go to a Trader Joe&#x27;s store.  </li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;ve been using this Shampoo, my scalp is no longer dry, itchy, and I&#x27;m dandruff free.</li>
            <li> Instead I have been using it mainly for clarifying purposes once a week</li>
            <li> Paul Mitchell Tea Tree Shampoo is way better; however, a lot more expensive.  </li>
            <li> It does tingle but mainly if it gets on my face.</li>
            <li> I also have Scalp Seborrhea which is one of the main causes of dandruff.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend if you have my type of hair,</li>
            <li> Highly recommended for anyone using head and shoulders or anything of the like</li>
            <li> I recommend highly try it</li>
            <li> Why is the price so high here?</li>
            <li> When I came upon Trader Joe&#x27;s Tea Tree Tingle Shampoo, at only $3.99 with natural ingredients, I was so excited to try it.    </li>
            <li> Even though it claims to be all natural, there is definitely something in it that is not so friendly to me.</li>
            <li> I agree with a previous comment, this shampoo is very week , not enough to feel any kind of tingling sensation that you would normally feel with a shampoo that contains peppermint.</li>
            <li> I bought this from Trader Joe&#x27;s and was hoping it would be a great shampoo, but I was wrong.</li>
            <li> I have naturally oily skin and scalp, so I&#x27;m very prone to pimples and dandruff.</li>
            <li> I was surprised, but when I switched to this, my skin really cleared up.  </li>
            <li> like i normally do.</li>
            <li> I feel like I have to use a lot of it, like using a normal amount</li>
            <li> Looking for an economical alternative to similar Paul Mitchell products and found it with TJ Tee Tree shampoo.  </li>
            <li> i use this to gently bathe my hair and follow up with good dollop of the extra thick and creamy conditioner.  </li>
            <li> No more dry itchy scalp and my hair feel smooth and healthy.</li>
            <li> The shampoo lathered just enough to cleanse easily without creating a big cloud of foam like the SLS-containing shampoos that will ruin your hair will.</li>
            <li> Bottles are big and the prise is right.</li>
            <li> It has similar effect to Icy Hot or Ben Gay.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a fine shampoo and conditioner but not in the same league or even same galaxy as the Paul Mitchell one.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t leave any residue on my scalp like other overpriced sulfate free shampoos do.</li>
            <li> It can dry your hair depending on your hair type (works fine on my husband&#x27;s naturally oily hair but dries my naturally medium-dry hair) and doesn&#x27;t help at all with dandruff.</li>
            <li> This is my new go-to product for the winter.</li>
            <li> I literally live across the street from a Trader Joe&#x27;s, so I walked over there and bought it.</li>
            <li> We don&#x27;t have a trader Joe&#x27;s where I live.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know (and for the latter, I certainly hope not!).  </li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair, and that&#x27;s mainly the way I wear my hair.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> using it my daughters scalp has been very sensitive to the touch.</li>
            <li> The eucalyptus smell is very soft.</li>
            <li> My husband has very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> And wow was I pleasantly surprised!!  </li>
            <li> It is a natural product, very thick, so you don&#x27;t need as much of the product to get a nice lather.</li>
            <li> Usually I am able to use shampoos with small amounts of sulfa products in them</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> Be aware with essential oils for allergies.</li>
            <li> /&gt;As shampoos go, this is pretty basic.</li>
            <li> a Trader Joe&#x27;s near you!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Edited to add that the Original Sprout not only doesn&#x27;t spot the shower curtain, it eventually cleaned away the spots left by the Trader Joe&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> WOW!</li>
            <li> I strongly recommend this product to anyone suffering from dry scalp and dandruff, it is the only thing that has worked and now I can&#x27;t imagine using anything else.  </li>
            <li> Also, it is possible to be allergic to some of the other natural oils in the product, so make sure you aren&#x27;t allergic to any of the ingredients.&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you live anywhere near a store, buy it in person.</li>
            <li> Getting this shampoo in your eyes is probably one of the worse sensations I&#x27;ve experienced while taking a shower in a long time.</li>
            <li> After just a few days using this product I have noticed a huge difference in my hair and scalp.</li>
            <li> It would&#x27;ve been 5 stars had it not dried my hair out so much with daily use.</li>
            <li> Helped clear up my daughter&#x27;s dandruff and she loves the smell.</li>
            <li> If your hair is protein sensitive</li>
            <li> I thought maybe I was using too much, and tried using a smaller amount, but it did not help.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Two stars for being all natural, and I did like the shampoo.</li>
            <li> I guess I&#x27;m just sensitive to Tea Tree Oil.</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin stay far away from this product.</li>
            <li> Here, it costs nearly three times the price in a the company&#x27;s store, however.</li>
            <li> If there&#x27;s a Trader Joe&#x27;s near you, go get some.</li>
            <li> I have a sulfa allergy and nearly all mass marketed shampoos in the U.S. have some type if sulfa derivative in them.</li>
            <li> Only produces a light &amp;#34;tingling&amp;#34; sensation if left on your scalp for several minutes.  </li>
            <li> People complain about this being very striping but don&#x27;t realize that it&#x27;s actually a clarifying shampoo</li>
            <li> it does its job and its all natural and  </li>
            <li> However, after using it for a week or two I noticed that my scalp was getting itchy, and just recently I developed some itchy bumps in areas where the shampoo ran off when rinsing, e.g., the side of my neck and my torso.  </li>
            <li> I had a reaction like this before to another mint-based, natural shampoo (something I found at my co-op).  </li>
            <li> but without stripping it completely of its natural oils-</li>
            <li> it makes my somewhat naturally curly hair curlier&lt;</li>
            <li> This shampoo makes my gray hair really soft.  </li>
            <li> but since there isn&#x27;t a trader joe&#x27;s near by</li>
            <li> never knew a natural shampoo/conditioner could make</li>
            <li> /&gt;Trader Joe&#x27;s also has a gallon of Aloe Vera gel for $7.99 for the natural hair enthusiasts out there.</li>
            <li> I read reviews that this makes their hair brittle - well - yes, as there are no silicones or synthetic ingredients - its all natural products - just meant to cleanse.</li>
            <li> Not by itself very harmful to health unless you have allergies, but it also has contaminates in it such as NITROSAMINES which is carcinogenic (Radiocative, an cause</li>
            <li> I really like how this makes my hair feel, but additionally, it doesn&#x27;t cause breakouts on my shoulders like commercial hair products seem to for me.  </li>
            <li> Does not sulfate laureate which strips your hair of the natural oils.  </li>
            <li> I love the smell and it creates a thick lather.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice, big bottle for the price and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> In fact, my scalp got more itchy and where the shampoo came dripping down on the sides of my face, a red rash with bumps developed, same happened to the nape of my neck.</li>
            <li> I use it with a very small amount of marine biological conditioner (not on the roots), and I&#x27;m the happiest I&#x27;ve been with a shampoo in many years.  </li>
            <li> I really disliked the scent at first, but now it doesn&#x27;t bother me as much.</li>
            <li> I normally follow up with the tree tee conditioner which will bring the soft silky feeling back into your hair.</li>
            <li> This is one of the shampoos that is natural and gentle enough that I can actually use it without having my skin</li>
            <li> I was really looking forward to this shampoo as a change from Head and Shoulders to help with dry scalp and dandruff.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair soft after using and not dry and strawlike.  </li>
            <li> So on to the conditioner, it was not too thick, so easy to get out of the bottle.</li>
            <li> My husband decided to try the TJ shampoo and after 3 days of daily usage, he developed some flaking.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t lather very well at all, and it&#x27;s not very cleansing.&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m careful not to use that much in one shampooing) to scare away lice and kills bacteria &amp; fungi and also prevents dandruff and an itchy scalp.  </li>
            <li> Tea tree oil is a homeopathic treatment for dandruff and this shampoo is actually organic with natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a natural I have locs and not only does it tingle and moisturize my scalp</li>
            <li> This is a natural cleansing shampoo - for only $4 in the store.</li>
            <li> This will not make hair soft - it is only meant to cleanse.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t use it on colored hair because of this deep cleansing action.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a person who likes to only use all natural products.</li>
            <li> If I use this, it would have to be mixed with an all natural conditioner.</li>
            <li> American natural</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get barely any of a tingle sensation.</li>
            <li> And, rest assured, I do not have an exaggerated memory of what I tried years ago-- honest.</li>
            <li> we had a run of lice go through our house, and have been devoted to varying tea tree products since then, as tea tree oil is a wonderful lice repellent.  </li>
            <li> I have very dry thick but fine straight red hair prone to tangling.</li>
            <li> Possibly the mint is too strong for my skin, at least on my scalp.  </li>
            <li> My only negative is that the peppermint scent is really strong and stings your eyes...</li>
            <li> Apparently tea tree oil is a natural lice repellent and this is a nice way for kids to keep clean over the summer.  </li>
            <li> Since I use natural products I tend to be lazy and use shampoo as body wash sometimes and don&#x27;t worry about it too much since it&#x27;s all natural.</li>
            <li> although its pricey on Amazon, its still cheaper than other sulfate free shampoos that leaves residue in your hair and comes in less ounces.</li>
            <li> I went to trader&#x27;s joe looking for a shampoo that was paraben free and this shampoo was the only one (at least in my store).</li>
            <li> I am and African American woman with natural hair.  </li>
            <li> I am African American natural.</li>
            <li> This product (with my experiences) does not aid in natural African American hair.</li>
            <li> My scalp is never dry or itchy after using it, AND it&#x27;s sulfate-free.</li>
            <li> It removes all the product and does not dry out my hair.  </li>
            <li> It does not dry your hair and it doesn&#x27;t make it oily either.</li>
            <li> but I haven&#x27;t noticed this so apparently there isn&#x27;t enough protein to make that happen in my case.  </li>
            <li> Lately, I&#x27;ve been trying to take matters into my own hands and started looking for shampoos with the LEAST amount or NO CHEMICALS, just natural hair care.</li>
            <li> and after a few uses my head didn&#x27;t itch for literally the first time in months.  </li>
            <li> It also immediately helped clear up my dry scalp.</li>
            <li> My hair is soft to the touch and my curls are defined at long last.  </li>
            <li> It was super thick, I had to dilute it.</li>
            <li> The natural shampoos and conditioners I have used tend to be pretty expensive, sometimes as much as $17/bottle.</li>
            <li> Not so much on natural coarse dry hair.</li>
            <li> And the peppermint oil lends a refreshing scent that both perked me up on tired mornings and helped soothe dry or congested sinuses during the winter months.</li>
            <li> I purchased some here and sent it to a relative who does not live near a Trader Joe&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Usually with sulfate free shampoos I expect the difficulty to lather and some runniness, but this one was on the extreme for both.</li>
            <li> The lack of normal shampoo ingredients such as all the sulfates and other chemicals combined with the tea tree oil has done wonders for the skin on my neck and back, clearing up moderate acne.</li>
            <li> but somewhere down the line the entire bottle degraded from a normal shampoo texture to watery.</li>
            <li> just because something has natural ingredients doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean that it&#x27;s gentle.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s even tangled while I&#x27;m still in the shower and almost feels like a clarifying shampoo with out dry and bare my hair</li>
            <li> /&gt;Other reviewers say that they have had bad skin reactions to this, and that very well may be the case--there are a lot of essential oils and whatnot that might be too strong for some.  </li>
            <li> shampoo does take a little bit getting used to, as it doesn&#x27;t lather quite as much as froofy drug-store brands, and it can make your ends feel dry if you use a lot of it every day.  </li>
            <li> I am a black female with natural hair</li>
            <li> Not only did it dry my hair out so bad, even with the condition, my hair shed way more than normal.  </li>
            <li> I have a lot of hair and twelve ounces of shampoo does not last long for me</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend it to anyone, plus the price is low compared to other brands.</li>
            <li> It is hard to find a shampoo that is not loaded with chemicals that really works well on your hair, but this one is great.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have thin, fine hair and it does not weight it down.  </li>
            <li> Until recently I have not really looked at Trader Joe&#x27;s hair care items but while buying some jojoba oil</li>
            <li> I had psoriasis and as long as I use tea tree oil</li>
            <li> /&gt;After several days of using it, however, my head broke out in pimples and my scalp was extremely itchy.</li>
            <li> Some may want to do the lather, rinse, repeat act as tea tree oil traditionally doesn&#x27;t lather as much as other shampoos do</li>
            <li> /&gt;Other than that, there are some other chemicals in it like SODIUM HYDROXYMETHYLGLYCINATE,and 12-14 OLEFIN SULFONATE that can possibly cause allergic reactions.</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t use it daily due to sulfate allergy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going back to the other stuff.</li>
            <li> I have very long dry hair, but buildup from all the products I use and just oil from my scalp needs to be washed away weekly.</li>
            <li> My scalp can get dry and itchy but the shampoo/conditioner haven&#x27;t irritated my scalp or caused any dandruff.  </li>
            <li> I have a dry &amp; itchy scalp (no dandruff) and used to use Giovanni Tea Tree shampoo &amp; conditioner.</li>
            <li> I bought this to use about once a week in the winter, when my scalp gets really dry.</li>
            <li> Besides, it does nothing but dry you out and turn your hair into strawstraw.</li>
            <li> The only use for it is to make your appearance more ugly.</li>
            <li> However this shampoo didn&#x27;t help my itchy and dry scalp.</li>
            <li> however, once it was rinsed out the smell went with it, and by the time my hair was dry it no longer smelled like anything.</li>
            <li> I had been washing my hair without clarifying it and ended up with frizzy, dry hair.  </li>
            <li> I used to always use dandruff shampoo because I seemed always get dry scalp.</li>
            <li> dry my hair/scalp</li>
            <li> however, the scent leaves when hair is dry...</li>
            <li> I know clarifying shampoos have the tendency to make your hair feel dry</li>
            <li> If you continue using it, it will dry your hair out.</li>
            <li> I bought this shampoo at the actual store called &amp;#34;Trader Joes.&amp;#34; The shampoo last around 20-22 hours and then immediately your hair becomes greasy and not smooth.</li>
            <li> It not only hurts, but I suspect it caused some scaling on my eyeball (left eye won&#x27;t squeeze shut tightly!)</li>
            <li> i have been using the shampoo since July and have not experienced the tingling sensation that some of the customers have.i highly recommend this shampoo to everyone, especially if you suffer from dry scalp like i do.</li>
            <li> I looked at all the ingrediants and tea tree was always later down the ingrediant</li>
            <li> i purchased this because it was cheaper than the large 1L green bottle that i usually buy.</li>
            <li> The only problem I had with it is that it leaves your scalp a little dry, but if you use conditioner, it shouldn&#x27;t be a problem.</li>
            <li> I used this on my 3c, 4a hair which is very dry</li>
            <li> Cleans my hair and does not over dry my hair like some other brands.</li>
            <li> Maybe the product is old, and loses its pizzazz after an expiration date, which might explain the reduced price.</li>
            <li> so they actually put real peppermint in their shampoo which is completely useless.</li>
            <li> Be careful with this one.</li>
            <li> but eventually I reject them and end up with a blistery rash all over my scalp that takes anywhere from several days to a few weeks to heal.</li>
            <li> , I only wash my hair every few days; I noticed a few years ago that it was getting brittle and damaged by daily washing.</li>
            <li> So I  am left with dried out or gunky hair or both.  </li>
            <li> I noticed after using this a few times that it was leaving white spots on my shower curtain, even though I rinse it after every shower.  </li>
            <li> I recommend to people with silver, or platinum, hair as it does not leave a color residue, ie  green, orange, red tinted shampoo.</li>
            <li> Fearing that the reactions would only get worse, I&#x27;ve quit using this and returned to my old brand.    </li>
            <li> To rule out any other products or factors, I had been rinsing my hair for several days with just plain water.</li>
            <li> and I have been having really a dry, itchy scalp with slight dandruff.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry but did not feel any tingle which is the reason I bought the shampoo in the first place.</li>
            <li> This may give you a bit of drying feeling but nothing unbearable my hair wasn&#x27;t as stripped as other shampoos I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Not sure if I would pay $8 for this product knowing its only $3.99 in the store.</li>
            <li> My son likes it and uses it every other day.</li>
            <li> not I exclusively use treader joes tea-tree oil shampoo and organic virgin olive oil as conditioner every other time I wash my hair.</li>
            <li> I understand from other reviews this is overpriced.</li>
            <li> As other reviewers have pointed out, this shampoo costs $3.99 at TJ&#x27;s so you are paying quite a premium to buy it on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> a few times after using it I&#x27;ve realized that there was a thick strand of unwashed hair on the back of my head later in the day.</li>
            <li> It has other ingredients than just tea tree oil gel that cause skin irritation.  </li>
            <li> If you are looking for a shampoo that will strip all the added oil, gels and other things we put in our hair during the week, this is it.  </li>
            <li> While this shampoo is not as drying as other clarifiers I&#x27;ve used in the past, I found down the line that my hair still had build-up left on it even when using it.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t like to waste products especially since it was not cheap to purchase this online.</li>
            <li> I was having so much trouble with dry scalp and dandruff and it seemed like any product I used (selsun blue, head and shoulders, nioxin...) only made it worse.  </li>
            <li> Anyways, this product is MOSTLY free of bad ingredients.</li>
            <li> Guess my thick girl hair handles it differently.</li>
            <li> but it is way down on the list of ingredients.  </li>
            <li> Got this shampoo to cut down on sulfates.  </li>
            <li> The conditioner on the other hand is fab!</li>
            <li> I will not use any other shampoo!</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a very small amount of detergent mixed with gelatin.  </li>
            <li> i&#x27;m black with permed hair.  </li>
            <li> I have noticeably less oil buildup at the roots at the end of the day</li>
            <li> also, if you can get to TJ&#x27;s, It&#x27;s less than half the price there.  </li>
            <li> I have lost over half of my hair.</li>
            <li> My daughter borrowed it and said she had less split hairs.</li>
            <li> Sadly, we had to stop using it, and within 3 or 4 days, our scalps both felt normal again</li>
            <li> For the first time in six months I am not itching like crazy an hour after I wash my hair.</li>
            <li> My hair is a knotted mess after using this, even with an additional shampoo rinse and conditioner.</li>
            <li> The conditioner is not quite as thick and penetrating as one might prefer if they have really dry hair, but for me it does the trick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t always shampoo every day, and sometimes I just use a little on my roots and that&#x27;s it.</li>
            <li> No more dry scalp, no more itching.  </li>
            <li> I am not cheap when it comes to my hair.</li>
            <li> I have found a couple of things after using this shampoo for a few weeks:&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> I used it 2 times a day for a few days and I no longer had a problem.</li>
            <li> -- I have oily hair and can go a few days now between shampoos.</li>
            <li> Shampoo, i use it everyday</li>
            <li> I noticed my curly hair getting very stringy, limp, lifeless, and it felt just plain dirty.</li>
            <li> You can buy both the shampoo and conditioner for less!</li>
            <li> But usually after a few hours, my scalp starts itching and producing oil.</li>
            <li> I also have long thin hair</li>
            <li> I love that it is cruel free and contains a lot of goodness, hate that it is sub-par.  </li>
            <li> but it was not very effective at controlling my dandruff.</li>
            <li> I co-wash, but the next day it itches so so bad and the scabs are back.</li>
            <li> I have dealt with thin dry hair for years.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it can be attributed to something with my routine</li>
            <li> I have been using this conditioner for my co-washing about 3 times a week for the past 4 months.  </li>
            <li> The closest thing I have used to it in the past is a $16 per 12 oz.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what happened...</li>
            <li> there was no refreshing &amp;#34;tingle&amp;#34;, it did not stop my scalp itch, and it leaves a residue on your hair.  </li>
            <li> For years I have had a hard time finding shampoo that I am not allergic to.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;, at least not yet .since</li>
            <li> The price, at least in Kansas City, is $3.99 for a 16 oz.</li>
            <li> Nothing Negative to Report</li>
            <li> negative reviews -</li>
            <li> I added it to my usual fragrant fruity, floral or jasmine shampoo and it works purrrfectly!  </li>
            <li> I find a small amount does the trick, but just don&#x27;t get it in your eyes!  </li>
            <li> I have used all the expensive lines of shampoo and conditioner but hands down</li>
            <li> $10 is ridiculous, I picked it up in store for $3.99.  </li>
            <li> Might as well buy a less expensive shampoo.</li>
            <li> I did not wanted to buy any of those medicated shampoos because they said that they have chemicals that are not very good for your body, but after using this shampoo for two weeks the dandruff was gone!</li>
            <li> It has a really strong smell, which isn&#x27;t too much of a bad thing, just annoying.</li>
            <li> It made mine dry and straw like and impossible to manage.</li>
            <li> I went from thick hair to thinner hair in 2.5 months!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t dry my hair as badly as some shampoos.  </li>
            <li> i was really hoping for a shampoo that was extra cruelly tested on animals too :(</li>
            <li> However, after using this combo for a couple of weeks, I noticed that my itchy scalp problem did not go away, but in fact got worse.</li>
            <li> About six months ago my reactions started getting worse.</li>
            <li> Not as bad as what they said in other reviews.</li>
            <li> an other shampoo with soap base to them.  </li>
            <li> I got a horrible rash on my neck and my back.</li>
            <li> I was using an expensive dandruff shampoo before this and</li>
            <li> Also it was way too expensive for the amount of product/quality you get.</li>
            <li> To expensive for it to not work</li>
            <li> I hate the way my hair feels when I use it - it sucks all the moisture out.</li>
            <li> Crazy.</li>
            <li> Disappointing.</li>
            <li> I can even spend three days without washing my hair and it does not look dirty or oily.</li>
            <li> My hair felt like straw, and was so tangly it was impossible to brush.  </li>
            <li> Combined with the fact that it doesn&#x27;t lather well, this made it almost impossible to distribute throughout all of my hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too bad</li>
            <li> I used to have bad dandruff problems, itchy scalp, etc.</li>
            <li> It burned so bad even though I was rinsing my eyes with the shower head.</li>
            <li> Too bad I don&#x27;t have</li>
            <li> Itchy, painful...</li>
            <li> joe&#x27;s tea tree tingle conditioner with peppermint,&amp;#34; too), and boy was I disappointed.</li>
            <li> so to all my naturals this is a must, you won&#x27;t be disappointed 😉</li>
            <li> I hated it.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed with this product.  </li>
            <li> For the price and name (Trader Joe&#x27;s) I was very disappointed!  </li>
            <li> HORRIBLE !</li>
            <li> My scalp still itches and it made my hair feel horrible.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have dreadlocks and this shampoo works great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry but did not feel any tingle which is the reason I bought the shampoo in the first place.</li>
            <li> quick shipping thanks hope this does what everyone says it will.  Competative price and we will see if everyone is correct  about shampoo</li>
            <li> I liked it, it lathers well, rinses well and smells great, and it is affordable</li>
            <li> I have used all the expensive lines of shampoo and conditioner but hands down this is a great product for dry curly hair of moderate thickness.  It leaves my hair soft after using and not dry and strawlike.  I use the companion conditioner for it.  I get it at my local Trader Joe&#x27;s for $3.99 ea.  I would highly recommend if you have my type of hair, oh and I also color my hair and it doesn&#x27;t fade the color either.  If your hair is protein sensitive the conditioner has soy protein but it is way down on the list of ingredients.  My stylist said too much protein drys out the hair but I haven&#x27;t noticed this so apparently there isn&#x27;t enough protein to make that happen in my case.  My scalp can get dry and itchy but the shampoo/conditioner haven&#x27;t irritated my scalp or caused any dandruff.  Just make sure you rinse properly is most important.</li>
            <li> I have very dry thick but fine straight red hair prone to tangling. I have tried many products over the years and prefer a natural product. The natural shampoos and conditioners I have used tend to be pretty expensive, sometimes as much as $17/bottle. Until recently I have not really looked at Trader Joe&#x27;s hair care items but while buying some jojoba oil I noticed this shampoo and conditioner and figured for $3.99 I could just toss it is I hated it. I checked the ingredients and they more than measure up to the other natural products I have used - not quite as pure/organic as the shampoo bars I have used, but liquid is so much easier to use. So I bought the pair and brought it home.    And wow was I pleasantly surprised!!  The shampoo and conditioner smell great - just treelike enough to be fresh and invigorating but not make you smell like a throat lozenge. Very nice balance. The shampoo lathered just enough to cleanse easily without creating a big cloud of foam like the SLS-containing shampoos that will ruin your hair will. It rinsed clan and left my hair feeling very clean but not at all stripped. In fact it almost felt like I could get away without conditioner, but I know I cannot. So on to the conditioner, it was not too thick, so easy to get out of the bottle. It detangled my hair nicely. After rinsing and drying, I was SO HAPPY with these products! My hair was left clean and shiny, tangle-free and soft yet not weighed down, and very lightly scented with the clean outdoor smell of eucalyptus and mint.    I have very sensitive skin and I have not had any problems whatsoever with this shampoo and conditioner. I have been using this S/C combo for 3 months now and I&#x27;m very happy with it. I went for a hair cut and the stylist said my hair was very healthy and asked what kind of shampoo I use, I was happy to tell him \\&quot;Trader Joe&#x27;s\\&quot;!.</li>
            <li> I know the title is questionable, but yes my favorite shampoo is  Trader Joe&#x27;s brand. I have naturally curly hair, and that&#x27;s mainly the way I wear my hair. If you&#x27;re natural product junkie like, me you&#x27;ll love the Trader Joes&#x27;s Tea Tree Tingle Shampoo ($3.99). I only use it to wash my scalp, and it&#x27;s the best. My scalp is never dry or itchy after using it, AND it&#x27;s sulfate-free. If you don&#x27;t know, sulfate is very drying to the hair its agent is used in most cleaning products, which is why you need so much conditioner after you wash your hair. You feel like it&#x27;s being stripped! Well you won&#x27;t feel that way with this shampoo.....    see rest of review here: [...]</li>
            <li> I have been plagued with dry, flaking and itchy scalp for over 15 years and have tried every prescription shampoo on the market; been to many dermatologists and nothing helps. Lately, I&#x27;ve been trying to take matters into my own hands and started looking for shampoos with the LEAST amount or NO CHEMICALS, just natural hair care. When I came upon Trader Joe&#x27;s Tea Tree Tingle Shampoo, at only $3.99 with natural ingredients, I was so excited to try it.    To rule out any other products or factors, I had been rinsing my hair for several days with just plain water. On the 3rd day, I tried TJ&#x27;s Tea Tree Tingle Shampoo and it did NOT work for me. In fact, my scalp got more itchy and where the shampoo came dripping down on the sides of my face, a red rash with bumps developed, same happened to the nape of my neck. YIKES!!!! Allergic reaction!    My husband decided to try the TJ shampoo and after 3 days of daily usage, he developed some flaking. He has a normal, healthy scalp and his skin is not sensitive like mine... so apparently, the shampoo wasn&#x27;t good for him either.    What an eye-opener... just because something has natural ingredients doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean that it&#x27;s gentle.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this shampoo!!</li>
            <li> I bought this shampoo for my daughter to use bc it was all natural and liked the tea tree part bc tea tree is a deterrent for lice . She&#x27;s in elementary school and there&#x27;s always cases of lice in the beginning of the year. Fortunatey  we&#x27;ve never had lice&lt;br /&gt;, at least not yet .since using it my daughters scalp has been very sensitive to the touch. I could even brush one side of her hair. I even brought her to the doctor about it but he didn&#x27;t know what it was. Someone then had mentioned to me that tea tree oil was an endocrine disruptir and so I looked it up on line.  I also read that it can cause skin sensitivity such as burning sensation as well as a rash! I stopped I using the shampoo right away and she&#x27;s never had the sensivigve scalp since !  Will never use his product again. I threw out all the bottles I had.</li>
            <li> i love this shampoo.  it&#x27;s rich, it doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair, and it really cleans.  i use it as a bubble bath and  shower gel.  smells great too.  i&#x27;m black with permed hair.  i use this to gently bathe my hair and follow up with good dollop of the extra thick and creamy conditioner.  feels so good and luxurious. great bargain.</li>
            <li> I have a dry &amp; itchy scalp (no dandruff) and used to use Giovanni Tea Tree shampoo &amp; conditioner. They worked great, but were a bit pricy. Then I found the Trader Joe&#x27;s brand, and thought, this is great, practically the same ingredients for a fraction of the price ($3.99 at the store). I started using both the tea tree shampoo &amp; conditioner. However, after using this combo for a couple of weeks, I noticed that my itchy scalp problem did not go away, but in fact got worse. The shampoo &amp; conditioner feel great in the shower, tingly and soothing. But usually after a few hours, my scalp starts itching and producing oil. I now have an itchy and oily scalp. My hair stylist told me that maybe these products are stripping too much moisture away from the scalp, causing it to go into overdrive and produce more oil. I don&#x27;t know. I thought maybe I was using too much, and tried using a smaller amount, but it did not help. Perhaps this product is just not for me. Does anyone else have this issue?</li>
            <li> i was really hoping for a shampoo that was extra cruelly tested on animals too :(</li>
            <li> Product works great on mixed soft curly hair, but with a different conditioner than the tea tree version. Soothes scalp. Not so much on natural coarse dry hair. Price is a RIPOFF here. Cost $4.00 at Trader Joes! Order elsewhere....</li>
            <li> Love the way it feels, if you have colored hair it will strip your color if you use a lot.</li>
            <li> Definitely leaves your hair and scalp feeling clean and refreshed. Almost as if a weight has been lifted from your head.</li>
            <li> This is a good product however if you go directly to trader joes, it costs less than 5 bucks a bottle!  So don&#x27;t get ripped off online and pay this much.</li>
            <li> With winter coming on I decided to try some Tea Tree Tingle shampoo from Trader Joe&#x27;s. It definitely lives up to its namesake - as my head and nostrils were awakened with minty, tingly, freshness. I really liked the shampoo and liked that it contained natural ingredients&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After several days of using it, however, my head broke out in pimples and my scalp was extremely itchy. I thought it was just me until my husband had the same experience. We continued using it for almost a month but the reaction never improved. Sadly, we had to stop using it, and within 3 or 4 days, our scalps both felt normal again so we know it was the shampoo. Trader Joe&#x27;s even took the bottle back and exchanged it - no questions asked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two stars for being all natural, and I did like the shampoo. I guess I&#x27;m just sensitive to Tea Tree Oil.</li>
            <li> While this shampoo is not as drying as other clarifiers I&#x27;ve used in the past, I found down the line that my hair still had build-up left on it even when using it. About a month into using TJTTTS I noticed my curly hair getting very stringy, limp, lifeless, and it felt just plain dirty. Once I switched clarifying shampoos (Kinky Curly Come Clean), my curls sprung back to life and were free of their grimy feeling. I&#x27;m not sure if it can be attributed to something with my routine but I don&#x27;t think this is the clarifying shampoo for me. I also didn&#x27;t feel the tingle that it mentions on the bottle. It does have a nice earthy scent though which I liked.</li>
            <li> Not a bad product, but it doesn&#x27;t lather as well as I&#x27;d like. My roommate really likes it for his beard, though. Guess my thick girl hair handles it differently. It does have the nice tingle/cooling effect.</li>
            <li> Was ok, but did not give the the tingling sensation I was really hoping for, and the reason I bought this product.</li>
            <li> What I like about this shampoo after using it once I can say it does what it says in the name. This Product leaves your scalp tingling. I believe it is the peppermint that give you the soothing sensation of clean, fresh hair/scalp. I also love the ingredients. Since I&#x27;m a natural Kinky hair girl I try to look for the best ingredients in my products to avoid drying out my already dry hair. This may give you a bit of drying feeling but nothing unbearable my hair wasn&#x27;t as stripped as other shampoos I&#x27;ve used. I didn&#x27;t have the conditioner at the time so I pre-poo then used the product. I&#x27;m sure the product will work better with the conditioner that comes with the line I will definitely review on the conditioner soon.</li>
            <li> It smells wonderful and leaves your hair feeling fresh and clean. It&#x27;s best to use in combination with the conditioner !</li>
            <li> I tried this stuff a few years ago at my brother&#x27;s house and it practically set my scalp on fire-- in a good way. I loved it! So tingly and refreshing!  I was excited to get this conditioner in the mail (I bought the &amp;#34;trader joe&#x27;s tea tree tingle conditioner with peppermint,&amp;#34; too), and boy was I disappointed. Barely so much as a tickle.  Maybe the product is old, and loses its pizzazz after an expiration date, which might explain the reduced price. Or perhaps the ingredients have changed.  I don&#x27;t know (and for the latter, I certainly hope not!).  All I know is that it&#x27;s definitely not what I remember.  And, rest assured, I do not have an exaggerated memory of what I tried years ago-- honest. The disparity is simply too stark.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll write this review for the conditioner, too.  The quality of both were equally lacking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I should add, the shampoo bottles weren&#x27;t properly packaged. One of the bottles unscrewed and I lost about 3 ounces of shampoo during shipment. When I first opened the box, I thought, &amp;#34;MAN! This stuff is fragrant! I can smell it already!&amp;#34;  Then I realized it was only because it had coated the bottom of the box.  I didn&#x27;t complain or return it. I figured, for the price, it wasn&#x27;t worth the hassle.</li>
            <li> I have atopic dermatitis and my scalp can get VERY itchy. I have tried so many shampoos and conditioners, from Maroccan Oil, to Bumble to Bumble to Pantene to Redkin. I am not cheap when it comes to my hair. My hair is wavy and fine. I was going through trader joes and decided to try a all natural shampoo and conditioner, because nature should be able to clean and condition your hair right? They didn&#x27;t have chemical based hair products a hundred years ago, and people were doing just fine without it.   My main concern was that my hair was becoming brittle and breaking. I was initially using pantene before, the fragile to strong kind. That did not work, I saw my hair strands everywhere. When I used the tea tree tingle set, my hair was SO light and soft! I love it! I have not seen or felt any weakness in my hair nor am scared to see my hair strands around. I do not have an itchy scalp (although I do itch it out of habit sometimes). The peppermint in the shampoo and condition is strong and gives you a tingle in your scalp but it is just refreshing, not damaging, it also smells good after. My hair feels and looks the way a hair should. I remember going to a hair salon and the lady told me that she felt silicon in my hair, after using Pantene. I guess that is what you get getting cheap hair products at the pharmacy. Even though the Tea Tree Tingle is cheap, it is still good quality, which I am amazed about. I always thought you had to spend so much in order for your hair to look and feel good.</li>
            <li> THE SHAMPOO IS GOOD AND IT KIND OF A WAIST TO SHIP IT.&lt;br /&gt;I SHOULD HAVE BOUGHT IT AT THE LOCAL TRADER JOE&#x27;S STORE</li>
            <li> My husband and I LOVE this shampoo and we just recently moved from NC to FL where there is NO Trader Joes ;(  Not sure if I would pay $8 for this product knowing its only $3.99 in the store.</li>
            <li> After two uses, I love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve already written a longer review under the matching conditioner so I won&#x27;t repeat myself but I seem to have found a great shampoo/conditioner combination that won&#x27;t send me to the poorhouse.</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin stay far away from this product. I have been using this conditioner for my co-washing about 3 times a week for the past 4 months.  My scalp gets patches of crusty scabs after just 24 hours of using the product. I&#x27;ve continued to use the product because I bought 5 bottles of it so that I could get free shipping and I don&#x27;t like to waste products especially since it was not cheap to purchase this online. One bottle cost about $12 online. I later found out that it goes for $3 on the ground. Even though my scalp was suffering I continued to use the product since it clarified my hair so well and made my wash-n-go&#x27;s look very definded.  I now have one bottle of this conditioner left and I&#x27;m going to throw it away! My scalp feels good the day I co-wash, but the next day it itches so so bad and the scabs are back. I find myself picking at them and causing bleeding! This product has to go in the trash! I&#x27;m going to miss the way it makes my hair look, but what looks good does not always feel good and is not always good for you. Even though it claims to be all natural, there is definitely something in it that is not so friendly to me.</li>
            <li> This works really well, stops the itching, makes your scalp feel cool &amp; comfy</li>
            <li> I bought this to use about once a week in the winter, when my scalp gets really dry. I love how natural it is and the smell is really pleasant (not too strong). It also immediately helped clear up my dry scalp. This is my new go-to product for the winter. It&#x27;s a nice, big bottle for the price and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I have a fragrance allergy and thought this was a great option - all natural, just a lot of essential oils, nothing seemingly synthetic, nothing on my list of chemicals to avoid.  However, even though it contains absolutely NOTHING that I have a proven allergy to, when I skin tested it, it left a bright red rash! Itchy, painful...Yikes. The shampoo may smell great, but there&#x27;s something up with this. Might not cause this reaction on everybody, but it did for me. Be careful with this one.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t actually shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a very small amount of detergent mixed with gelatin.  It doesn&#x27;t lather very well at all, and it&#x27;s not very cleansing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is okay, but just a tiny bit weak compared to the Tea Tree shampoo from Great Clips.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;re getting bent over if pay these prices. Besides, it does nothing but dry you out and turn your hair into strawstraw.</li>
            <li> Excellent service and a good product.</li>
            <li> I usually love all Trader Joe&#x27;s beauty products but I wasn&#x27;t a fan of this shampoo. The scent is actually not bad, especially considering the fact that I don&#x27;t like the smell of tea tree oil but this shampoo just didn&#x27;t really do anything for my hair and it dried out my scalp</li>
            <li> Gets hair very clean. Kind of tingly! I really like it. Would definitely order this again in the future. Woo!</li>
            <li> I was looking for a cheaper tea tree oil shampoo but still effective with natural and good non-cheap-synthetic-toxic-chemicals quality ingredients in it and found it at Trader Joe&#x27;s and this shampoo was purrrfect!!  I added it to my usual fragrant fruity, floral or jasmine shampoo and it works purrrfectly!  Trader Joe&#x27;s tea tree really cleans my hair (I feel my head tingling so I&#x27;m careful not to use that much in one shampooing) to scare away lice and kills bacteria &amp; fungi and also prevents dandruff and an itchy scalp.  This works along with my jasmine shampoo which moisturizes and makes my hair fragrantly feminine.  It&#x27;s too bad Trader Joe&#x27;s couldn&#x27;t make a shampoo which had BOTH tea tree oil AND jasmine, japanese cherry blossom, or some other beautiful exotic feminine fragrance.</li>
            <li> Item as described and shipped in a timely manner, thank you.</li>
            <li> I bought for dandruff. It didn&#x27;t work so well for my problem. The tingle part was very, very nice. So I still use it sometimes just cause. My son likes it and uses it every other day.</li>
            <li> I am and African American woman with natural hair.  This shampoo was very drying for my hair.  The conditioner on the other hand is fab!</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product, with true benefits for anyone suffering from eczema or dandruff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is one of the most cost effective tea tree shampoos available --- when purchased in a retail outlet. Here, it costs nearly three times the price in a the company&#x27;s store, however. If there&#x27;s a Trader Joe&#x27;s near you, go get some.</li>
            <li> I would definitely buy this again as it has a great smell and a nice tingle feeling.  Overall, a great value.</li>
            <li> This shampoo smells amazing and does give a nice tingling feeling. However, it does not lather well at all, so I end up using a ton of it.</li>
            <li> I love the way this shampoo tingles on my scalp and it smells amazing. I am so glad I purchased this. I will definitely be getting the conditioner.</li>
            <li> really does tingle, and I love the feeling. Leaves my hair clean after all the goop I use on it.</li>
            <li> Because my hair dries easily I won&#x27;t use this daily. Instead I have been using it mainly for clarifying purposes once a week or whenever my hair feels like it is in need of a good clean.&lt;br /&gt;Tingly and great smelling, I also used this with the conditioner which was pretty good as well.&lt;br /&gt;Picked up at my local TJ&#x27;s and you cannot beat the price!&lt;br /&gt;I think it is a great deal for a natural product.</li>
            <li> The price, at least in Kansas City, is $3.99 for a 16 oz. bottle of this shampoo or conditioner. For years I have had a hard time finding shampoo that I am not allergic to. I have a sulfa allergy and nearly all mass marketed shampoos in the U.S. have some type if sulfa derivative in them. Even most sulfate free shampoos have sulfonamides. Usually I am able to use shampoos with small amounts of sulfa products in them but eventually I reject them and end up with a blistery rash all over my scalp that takes anywhere from several days to a few weeks to heal. About six months ago my reactions started getting worse. The sensitive skin and allergies lead to flaky scalp and good luck finding a dandruff shampoo without sulfa. I tried a couple of so called &amp;#34;organic&amp;#34; shampoos only to realize after an allergic reaction that they contained organic products but were not exclusively organic. I was about to resort to trying a shampoo that is $25 for 12 ounces. I have a lot of hair and twelve ounces of shampoo does not last long for me and we really can&#x27;t afford that kind of expense. Then, by chance, I ran across a review for this shampoo. Tea tree oil is a homeopathic treatment for dandruff and this shampoo is actually organic with natural ingredients. For the first time in six months I am not itching like crazy an hour after I wash my hair. The shampoo has a cool tingly feeling too and smells wonderful. It does a great job cleaning and the conditioner is light but effective.  The closest thing I have used to it in the past is a $16 per 12 oz. bottle product. I am loving this shampoo and am so glad I ran across the review for it. For $3.99, if you live within driving distance of a Trader Joe&#x27;s, it is worth a try if you are in search of something for sensitive scalp and/or dandruff but it is definitely worth the selling price here as well.</li>
            <li> Good but Tue product at TJ&#x27;s is $4 vs. $10</li>
            <li> I have been reluctant to try it.  I do not know how it was opened or where the leak came from</li>
            <li> I love Trader Joe&#x27;s, but I&#x27;m using twice as much shampoo just to work up a lather, so I&#x27;m not finding it cost effective.  Otherwise, it&#x27;s just &#x27;eh&#x27;.  I really disliked the scent at first, but now it doesn&#x27;t bother me as much. Just not my favorite product of theirs.</li>
            <li> It is simply a wonderful product which is what I expect from Trader Joes.  Thank you.  Barbara Everett Heintz</li>
            <li> Tingle is right!  Tea Tree Tingle Shampoo feels so great as a lather while shampooing.  I love the invigorating feel.</li>
            <li> I like it smells great.</li>
            <li> While the smell and clean feeling is really nice, this shampoo is so clarifying that it dries my hair out!  One use was enough for me.  Maybe I&#x27;ll use it as body wash.</li>
            <li> I bought this shampoo at the actual store called &amp;#34;Trader Joes.&amp;#34; The shampoo last around 20-22 hours and then immediately your hair becomes greasy and not smooth. Your hair starts to itch and a lot of white dots fall off when you scratch your hair. These white dots look like dandruff but they are not. They are actually real peppermint. Yes, Trader Joes is good with food so they actually put real peppermint in their shampoo which is completely useless. The only use for it is to make your appearance more ugly.</li>
            <li> I tend to have a problem with regular name brand shampoos causing my hair to accumulate a residue over time, so I kept having to switch shampoos/conditioners to try to prevent it.  I stumbled upon Trader Joe&#x27;s line of personal care products and decided to try it.  For the Tea Tree Tingle, the \\&quot;tingle\\&quot; isn&#x27;t as noticeable after you&#x27;ve used the shampoo/conditioner for a bit, but it smells very pleasant.  I used the Tea Tree Tingle for about 4 months and now I&#x27;m going to try their Vitamin C shampoo just to switch it up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this product to someone, it is fantastic!</li>
            <li> Great product....we had a run of lice go through our house, and have been devoted to varying tea tree products since then, as tea tree oil is a wonderful lice repellent.  This one lathers nicely, and is gentle on my kiddos hair!  Have added it to our subscription service, so we never run out. :)</li>
            <li> Nice scent, and cleans my hair really well. Nice lather.</li>
            <li> ...then this is the shampoo for you! I have straight, fine oily hair, and this shampoo gives me scalp pimples. Gross.</li>
            <li> I was really looking forward to this shampoo as a change from Head and Shoulders to help with dry scalp and dandruff. I can&#x27;t lather up this shampoo, I feel like it doesn&#x27;t get my hair clean, and it does nothing to improve the dandruff situation. It smells nice and makes a great bubble bath.</li>
            <li> Only produces a light &amp;#34;tingling&amp;#34; sensation if left on your scalp for several minutes.  Paul Mitchell Tea Tree Shampoo is way better; however, a lot more expensive.  This shampoo is good for the price.  You can get it at Trader Joes for $3.99.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo, it smells good and does exactly what it says it will do. However, I have curly course hair and I can&#x27;t use it daily, or even twice a week, because it drys my hair out to the point of breaking. I use it once or twice a month now, the itch stays gone and my hair survives.</li>
            <li> Boy am I glad I read the reviews before ordering. Trader Joe&#x27; sells this in their stores for $3.99! I literally live across the street from a Trader Joe&#x27;s, so I walked over there and bought it. If you live anywhere near a store, buy it in person. You can buy both the shampoo and conditioner for less!</li>
            <li> I started loosing a lot of hair after I started using this shampoo.  Don&#x27;t use this if you don&#x27;t wanna go bald.</li>
            <li> I used to have bad dandruff problems, itchy scalp, etc. not I exclusively use treader joes tea-tree oil shampoo and organic virgin olive oil as conditioner every other time I wash my hair. My hear feels and smells great, no itchiness or dandruff! You notice resultants within a week!!! Highly recommended for anyone using head and shoulders or anything of the like</li>
            <li> Nice sulfate free shampoo, however it less than half the online price if you go to a Trader Joe&#x27;s store.  Even at this price I think its a decent value if you need hair products that are sulfate free.  I have thin, fine hair and it does not weight it down.  I also use the conditioner which also works well for my hair type.  Smells good and lathers well, especially for a shampoo that is sulfate free.</li>
            <li> Tingly and refreshing</li>
            <li> People complain about this being very striping but don&#x27;t realize that it&#x27;s actually a clarifying shampoo it&#x27;s amazing for when you have product build up and you only need to use it once a month so when you do use it I suggest pair it up with your conditioner at the same time on your hair that way no moisture leaves your hair and personally I think this is the best clarifying shampoo cause it does its job and its all natural and  you won&#x27;t haft to make your own home made clarifying shampoo And it&#x27;s amazing with the conditioner that goes with it</li>
            <li> Cleans as advertised. The lack of normal shampoo ingredients such as all the sulfates and other chemicals combined with the tea tree oil has done wonders for the skin on my neck and back, clearing up moderate acne. Yes the price on Amazon is 6 to 7 dollars more than Trader Joes but I do not have one of those within 200 miles so it is worth it to me.</li>
            <li> This is a nice shampoo for dry flakey itchy scalp that doesnt use chemicals to relieve.  I would and have purchased again. I recommend highly try it u will be satisfied!</li>
            <li> I wanted to love this product. I had read amazing things about it, I love Trader Joe&#x27;s and the price was great ($3.99). When I washed my hair, I loved the scent and the tingle. I even loved the way my hair felt as I was washing it and after it dried. The only problem: there is something in this concoction that does not mesh well with my skin. I got a horrible rash on my neck and my back. My hair loves it, but my skin...not so much.</li>
            <li> Peppermint shampoo is a family favorite.  Delivery was prompt and the product is wonderful.  Will definitely reorder when we run out.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome</li>
            <li> I really love the minty smell of the shampoo, and it lathered up pretty well and seemed to clean my hair OK.  However, after using it for a week or two I noticed that my scalp was getting itchy, and just recently I developed some itchy bumps in areas where the shampoo ran off when rinsing, e.g., the side of my neck and my torso.  Fearing that the reactions would only get worse, I&#x27;ve quit using this and returned to my old brand.    I should have known - I had a reaction like this before to another mint-based, natural shampoo (something I found at my co-op).  Possibly the mint is too strong for my skin, at least on my scalp.  I ended up using the other bottle with my foot brush to scrub my feet, which was perfect because I could enjoy the peppermint scent, and my feet didn&#x27;t react to the product.  That will probably be the fate of the Trader Joe&#x27;s bottle as well.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo.  It doesn&#x27;t irritate my scalp like most shampoos do.  It leaves my hair feeling clean, without drying out the ends.</li>
            <li> Like another reviewer posted, I did not get the tingling sensation and am skeptical about ha cleansing properties being very potent, but am happy to support cruelty free products.  This makes a nice foamy bubble bath so that&#x27;s I use use it for now. I will continue to use my Zum bars soaps for deep cleansing though.</li>
            <li> I loved the smell and feel of this shampoo. The only problem I had with it is that it leaves your scalp a little dry, but if you use conditioner, it shouldn&#x27;t be a problem. Leaves your scalp tingly!</li>
            <li> Great product...just as advertised...I would highly recommend this hair product..and it was shipped fast and safe in a baggy just in case an accident happened</li>
            <li> I have a love/hate thing with this shampoo.  I love that it helps keep my itchy, flaky scalp clear.  I love the tingle and light scent, and the &amp;#34;no animal testing&amp;#34; aspects.  I hate the way my hair feels when I use it - it sucks all the moisture out.</li>
            <li> Very clean and smells nice too, does have a good deep clean to Trader Joe&#x27;s</li>
            <li> I agree with a previous comment, this shampoo is very week , not enough to feel any kind of tingling sensation that you would normally feel with a shampoo that contains peppermint.</li>
            <li> I have used all kinds of dandruff shampoo &amp; have never had good results.  When I bought this I didn&#x27;t get it for my dandruff but soon found out that my dandruff was going away.  No more dry scalp, no more itching.  Use with the conditioner for the best results.</li>
            <li> I have dealt with thin dry hair for years. It has always felt like straw! I learned by searching online to stay away from sulfates because they strip the hair and cause dryness. So I did a search for shampoos without sulfates and came across the Trader Joes brand. Wow! After just a few days using this product I have noticed a huge difference in my hair and scalp. No more dry itchy scalp and my hair feel smooth and healthy. I will not use any other shampoo!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite shampoo. it does a brilliant job of washing- but not stripping- my hair , and it smells wonderful!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, I only wash my hair every few days; I noticed a few years ago that it was getting brittle and damaged by daily washing. (I was not using this shampoo at the time.) I likethis one because it cleans my hair even when it&#x27;s gotten a bit greasy, but without stripping it completely of its natural oils- thqt&#x27;s a tricky balance, and for me- this shampoo achieves it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plus- I just love the scents of tea tree oil and lavender! so that&#x27;s a plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also sometimes use it as a body wash, and it&#x27;s just as good there.</li>
            <li> This shampoo smells so good and the ingredients listed on the bottle are all natural. I have found a couple of things after using this shampoo for a few weeks:&lt;br /&gt;- it makes my somewhat naturally curly hair curlier&lt;br /&gt;- I have noticeably less oil buildup at the roots at the end of the day&lt;br /&gt;- my hair is more prone to frizz when I use this product&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, the great smell, natural ingredients and reduced amount of oil are worth the frizz. I will continue to use this product</li>
            <li> This shampoo makes my gray hair really soft.  Will continue to use for sure.</li>
            <li> It is ok. I like the smell and feel, but it isn&#x27;t doing me any favors. We don&#x27;t have a trader Joe&#x27;s where I live. I visited my sister and saw this for $3. I paid 3x that much!!! if I had paiud $3, I would have liked it a lot better. But for 10? Will NOT purchase again</li>
            <li> We have bought this item before. It is a natural product, very thick, so you don&#x27;t need as much of the product to get a nice lather. The smell is wonderful.</li>
            <li> Kinda watery consistency that requires too much product to get a good lather going. Smells nice and feels nice on the skin, however.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo b/c I teach school and little kids love to surprise me w/ a hug where they lay their head on my shoulder or somesuch and I don&#x27;t want to ever get infested w/ anything.  I find a small amount does the trick, but just don&#x27;t get it in your eyes!  It not only hurts, but I suspect it caused some scaling on my eyeball (left eye won&#x27;t squeeze shut tightly!) I had to see a doctor about.  Also be careful where you let it get on your body; it can make sensitive parts tingle, too.  I do NOT suggest using this on children.  also, if you can get to TJ&#x27;s, It&#x27;s less than half the price there.  Crazy.</li>
            <li> ok- not as good as pm</li>
            <li> Loved this! Yes, you can find this product at the local Trader Joes for $3.99. That is where I purchased mines. Same size. This shampoo works wonders. I am African American natural. If you had to type me I would be a 4c.  My scalp was sooooo itchy for months now. I couldn&#x27;t alleviate it.  This in one wash has taken that away.  And yes, it really tingles!!!!!  I used this as a clarifying shampoo prior to a caramel treatment from eta. This was great! I am adding this as a staple to my regimen</li>
            <li> This is not the kind of shampoo where you&#x27;re gonna experience tingling smells immediately. The eucalyptus smell is very soft.</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s me. Scent is good. Not as bad as what they said in other reviews. However this shampoo didn&#x27;t help my itchy and dry scalp.</li>
            <li> I chose this product because of the qualities of the shampoo that are optimal for my hair. I love this product.</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo. Stopped my itchy scalp. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> Disappointing. No &amp;#34;Tingle&amp;#34; at all and I vastly overpaid.  I was a fool to buy this.</li>
            <li> It smells great, I get a good clean without drying my hair or fading my henna.</li>
            <li> i love that this shampoo have no laurel/laureth sulfates in it. it lathers so well so i don&#x27;t have to use a lot of shampoo on my big head like i normally do. it doesn&#x27;t leave any residue on my scalp like other overpriced sulfate free shampoos do. the shampoo is 16 oz and only 3 dollars in store but since there isn&#x27;t a trader joe&#x27;s near by so i just order the shampoo off of Amazon. although its pricey on Amazon, its still cheaper than other sulfate free shampoos that leaves residue in your hair and comes in less ounces. . i have read the reviews about the shampoo, and some people stated that the shampoo leaves their head tingling while others stated that it don&#x27;t. i have been using the shampoo since July and have not experienced the tingling sensation that some of the customers have.i highly recommend this shampoo to everyone, especially if you suffer from dry scalp like i do. the peppermint really helps with all the scalp problems i was having trouble with.</li>
            <li> first off, if you can buy this in store it is much cheaper. secondly, i hope you like mint because my nose was overwhelmed with minty smell when lathering up. however, once it was rinsed out the smell went with it, and by the time my hair was dry it no longer smelled like anything. and thirdly, i don&#x27;t know if my hair has ever been as shiny as it is when i use this shampoo with the accompanying conditioner. wowzas! never knew a natural shampoo/conditioner could make my (coarse/straight) hair look and feel so good.</li>
            <li> I just love tea tree oil shampoos and this one is no exception. Cleans my hair and does not over dry my hair like some other brands. I also have long thin hair and it keeps my from getting too oily by the end of the day. Bottles are big and the prise is right.</li>
            <li> I understand from other reviews this is overpriced. However, I have no Trader Joe&#x27;s close to me so I paid the price. So my review is on the shampoo which I find great!  I was using an expensive dandruff shampoo before this and while that shampoo worked, it didn&#x27;t clean my scalp like I thought it should.  So I gave this a try to see. And I have had no dandruff since using it.  And my scalp feels clean. The peppermint scent is great in fact will open your sinus&#x27; while washing your hair. It does tingle but mainly if it gets on my face. I think it&#x27;s a good product and I love the organic ingredients in it.</li>
            <li> Great sulfate free, paraben free all natural shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tea tree oil is great as a stimulant for hair growth. Be aware with essential oils for allergies. This is a great basic, non toxic product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As shampoos go, this is pretty basic. The idea is to clean hair, not overdry, and not strip oils. This pretty much fits the bill. It is more clarifying in a gentle way, and sets you up for a great conditioning treatment.</li>
            <li> Awesome tingly shampoo, I guess if there isn&#x27;t a Trader Joe&#x27;s near you and you have to pay ten bucks, so be it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trader Joe&#x27;s also has a gallon of Aloe Vera gel for $7.99 for the natural hair enthusiasts out there.</li>
            <li> Love the tingly feeling, and gets hair squeeky clean, but you definitely need to use conditioner after this. I don&#x27;t use this shampoo for dandruff, so I cannot comment on that aspect.</li>
            <li> This is a little too clarifying for my hair type, it kind of dries my hair out. I like the feeling it gives my scalp so I still use it, just not on a daily basis. The tingle feeling people describe just feels like a cool/menthol feeling to me but it&#x27;s enjoyable nonetheless. Since I use natural products I tend to be lazy and use shampoo as body wash sometimes and don&#x27;t worry about it too much since it&#x27;s all natural. I do not do that with this shampoo though because it does have a pretty intense coolness sensation on my scalp and I&#x27;m hesitant to wash my nether regions with it because of that lol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it does have a very noticeable &amp;#34;tingle,&amp;#34; it has a minty scent that men would like as well and works great for clarifying. It can dry your hair depending on your hair type (works fine on my husband&#x27;s naturally oily hair but dries my naturally medium-dry hair) and doesn&#x27;t help at all with dandruff. We seen some people mention in reviews that it helped them with dandruff which was the reason we initially bought it but it hasn&#x27;t helped that for us. I don&#x27;t knock off stars for that though since it&#x27;s not a claim they make, just thought I should mention it in case you&#x27;re looking for the same reason we were. It would&#x27;ve been 5 stars had it not dried my hair out so much with daily use.</li>
            <li> Nice  but as other reviews said can get at trader joes for $3.99 that with shipping not worth it better to buy paul Mitchell as that one has the best tree oil</li>
            <li> Thuis shampoo is amazing! I&#x27;m a natural I have locs and not only does it tingle and moisturize my scalp it smells great! I TOLD ALL OF MY FRIENDS! so to all my naturals this is a must, you won&#x27;t be disappointed 😉</li>
            <li> I purchased this shampoo to clarify my hair because I am using the Curly Girl Method.  I had been washing my hair without clarifying it and ended up with frizzy, dry hair.  I used this on my 3c, 4a hair which is very dry and it did not dry it out more.  My hair is soft to the touch and my curls are defined at long last.  I bought it at Trader Joe&#x27;s (under $6.00).</li>
            <li> Excellent product. I would recommend to everyone.</li>
            <li> I was having so much trouble with dry scalp and dandruff and it seemed like any product I used (selsun blue, head and shoulders, nioxin...) only made it worse.  I was losing a lot of hair from itching and breaking.  I started reading about tea tree oil and started to do some experiments with it, and then I found this product and I am very pleased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo doesn&#x27;t smell medicinal at all, and contains many oils that are apparently very beneficial to the hair and scalp, including tea tree, peppermint, lavender, rosemary, thyme...and after a few uses my head didn&#x27;t itch for literally the first time in months.  I was so happy to not feel itchy at all, and plus my curly long hair started to look great and bouncy and healthy again.  I strongly recommend this product to anyone suffering from dry scalp and dandruff, it is the only thing that has worked and now I can&#x27;t imagine using anything else.  I use the conditioner too btw.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HOWEVER. $10 is ridiculous, I picked it up in store for $3.99.  Why is the price so high here?</li>
            <li> I have heard good things about this brand. It works well. I like it I just wish it would tingle</li>
            <li> Smells great, but there&#x27;s no tingle at all. I bought this from Trader Joe&#x27;s and was hoping it would be a great shampoo, but I was wrong. Not only did it dry my hair out so bad, even with the condition, my hair shed way more than normal.  I used it for a week to see if there was a transition phase considering it is &#x27;low poo&#x27;.  Nope.  My hair felt like straw, and was so tangly it was impossible to brush.  Will be returning this product.</li>
            <li> Got it for my brother who is a tea tree maniac. Somehow guys like this smell.. he was very happy with the product and washes his hair everyday because it makes him feel good..</li>
            <li> just the tingling shampoo i been looking for</li>
            <li> I loved this shampoo at first. It was great and made my scalp feel so clean. I&#x27;m not sure what happened... but somewhere down the line the entire bottle degraded from a normal shampoo texture to watery. I have to tip the bottle onto my head to even hope to use this shampoo which means I end up with tons on my hair and sometimes some in my eyes. Getting this shampoo in your eyes is probably one of the worse sensations I&#x27;ve experienced while taking a shower in a long time. It&#x27;s a burn that goes on for the rest of the shower. I&#x27;d sooner accidentally shave off a part of my ankle again.</li>
            <li> I love the minty tingle of this shampoo and the way it cools your scalp, a nice touch after a sweaty workout or on a hot day.  I buy this for my sisters kids to take to summer camp, where head lice seem to crop up every year. Apparently tea tree oil is a natural lice repellent and this is a nice way for kids to keep clean over the summer.  But as others noted, you can pick this up at any Trader Joes market for $3.99 a bottle vs the price here on Amazon.  Oh, its also sulfate free, and about one quarter the cost of the high priced sulfate free products sold in salons.</li>
            <li> I use this shampoo all the time and really like it... great scent, helps with scalp itching and leaves my hair clean and shiny.  (Do I sound like a hair commercial?)... As other reviewers have pointed out, this shampoo costs $3.99 at TJ&#x27;s so you are paying quite a premium to buy it on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t have a TJ&#x27;s near you, I suggest you check out Nature&#x27;s Gate Tea Tree Shampoo... which is also very nice:  [[ASIN:B001E6P6MQ Nature&#x27;s Gate Tea Tree Calming Shampoo for Irritated, Flaky Scalp, 18-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 3)]]  and current pricing is about 30 cents per ounce - a big savings!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also like TJ&#x27;s Tea Tree conditioner... light on the hair, without being overpowering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps.  Happy washing!</li>
            <li> This shampoo is called tingling for a reason! The fragrance is clean, crisp, and refreshing. The ingredients are natural and easy to pronounce.  The shampoo does not provide a bubbly lather in the way that soaps with chemicals do. I have no problems producing a rich lather, it just has to be worked at a bit more. Once on the scalp, the wash provides a cooling/tingling sensation that is very refreshing and provides a clean feel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;+ Price (at trader Joe&#x27;s, Although I would pay the Amazon Price Gladly)&lt;br /&gt;+ Long Lasting&lt;br /&gt;+ Tingling/Cooling Feeling makes for a refreshing shower&lt;br /&gt;+ Natural&lt;br /&gt;+ Chemical Free&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Nothing Negative to Report&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;_Bottom Line_ Yes, I would recommend this to a friend. I purchased some here and sent it to a relative who does not live near a Trader Joe&#x27;s. He loves it! I would absolutely recommend it and I will continue to buy it. $4 at Trader Joe&#x27;s is a great deal but I would gladly pay $11 w/prime if I had to. This is great stuff, just be patient when working up a good lather. I used to always use dandruff shampoo because I seemed always get dry scalp. I use this shampoo and have not had any problems with dandruff in months.</li>
            <li> It has a really strong smell, which isn&#x27;t too much of a bad thing, just annoying. It was super thick, I had to dilute it. I feel like I have to use a lot of it, like using a normal amount doesn&#x27;t do enough to actually clean</li>
            <li> I knew that adding the shampoo, to boost the effects of the clean and tingly feeling you get after using both.</li>
            <li> I really like the shampoo. Great price for the amount, too. I&#x27;m going to order more because now my mom is using it!</li>
            <li> I use WEN products, and once a week I want to clarify my hair and scalp.  This shampoo has been a wonderful addition to my routine.</li>
            <li> I bought this to use for eczema that had spread to my head.  I used it 2 times a day for a few days and I no longer had a problem. It is very soothing on the scalp and the fragrances is clean and fresh.  I will keep a bottle of this around at all times.  They were very quick in shipping as well.</li>
            <li> This product did none of the things it said it would...there was no refreshing &amp;#34;tingle&amp;#34;, it did not stop my scalp itch, and it leaves a residue on your hair.  Very disappointed with this product.  The only good thing about it was that I didn&#x27;t have to pay an arm and a leg for it.</li>
            <li> I find this one of the weakest tea tree shampoos I have ever used. No noticeable tingling sensation at all.</li>
            <li> I use this on my locs with the conditioners, it is a clarifying shampoo. Its also only $3.99 at TJ.</li>
            <li> Other Tea Tree products have proven to be much more exciting on the scalp.&lt;br /&gt;This one just had a mild tingle to it</li>
            <li> It smells minty, but it doesn&#x27;t taste minty.</li>
            <li> If you love the feel of mint and a chill, then spend the money to bring this product home! It&#x27;s fantastic, and I personally love using it after the gym. My head gets really hot when I&#x27;m sweating with my hair in a ponytail, and being able to scrub this shampoo in and feel like my scalp is standing on a mountain singing with Julie Andrews is a great after-gym treat. Your scalp will feel cleaner and cooler, and you&#x27;ll walk out of the shower with a smile on your face!</li>
            <li> It is making me lose my hair!! I have lost over half of my hair. I went from thick hair to thinner hair in 2.5 months! I just learned today from my doctor that this is the cause of my hair loss, and now I&#x27;m furious!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like this shampoo; I&#x27;ll stick with Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Liquid Castile Soap, it not only makes a great shampoo, its also great for many other cleaning projects, including brushing your teeth.</li>
            <li> Not near as good as the Paul Mitchell tea tree shampoo but it is better than nothing.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! Nice clean tingle, wonderful smell.</li>
            <li> Got this shampoo to cut down on sulfates.  I love the smell and it creates a thick lather.  Will consider using it exclusively in the future for shampooing needs.</li>
            <li> My head isn&#x27;t itchy and flaky anymore. The build up is gone. Definitely worth the money!! I will buy again!</li>
            <li> This shampoo is perfect for kids in school.  The products ingredients deter head lice.  A great way to stop a problem before it starts.</li>
            <li> arrived in good time. Suds are good but did not do a thing for the itching. Would not buy again.</li>
            <li> Great shampoo! You definitely feel the tingling sensation on your scalp but BEWARE..if this gets in your eyes, prepare to be blinded for about 5 minutes. It burned so bad even though I was rinsing my eyes with the shower head. But it does a great job of cleaning your hair and leaves it soft. Good quality shampoos aren&#x27;t supposed to lather much and this one doesn&#x27;t so it&#x27;s worth trying out.</li>
            <li> This product is great, natural ingredients peppermint, tea tree oil etc. non soap type experience is wonderful. even getting it in your eyes just rinse with water and you can feel the difference between it an other shampoo with soap base to them.  Some may want to do the lather, rinse, repeat act as tea tree oil traditionally doesn&#x27;t lather as much as other shampoos do however this shampoo does a great job of cleaning.  Try the the conditioner and the body wash as well! Not a bad price, hear it&#x27;s even better at a Trader Joe&#x27;s near you!</li>
            <li> Seems to be a great product.  Thanks...</li>
            <li> Amazing! Leaves my hair feeling really refreshing. Would most certainly buy again.</li>
            <li> I am a black female with natural hair and I have been having really a dry, itchy scalp with slight dandruff. Since I&#x27;ve been using this Shampoo, my scalp is no longer dry, itchy, and I&#x27;m dandruff free. I love this, but you most definitely need to condition your hair afterwards. Also, I love the \\&quot;clean\\&quot; feeling you get.</li>
            <li> I had keratin done on my hair so I was looking for a dandruff shampoo without sulfates. I felt the mint. You can definitely feel the tingle but it was not very effective at controlling my dandruff. Otherwise the shampoo was fine.</li>
            <li> I like to remove all the product from my hair, but have dry skin and hair and can not shampoo more than every four days.  So I  am left with dried out or gunky hair or both.  This tea tree shampoo is not harsh as some others are, and the smell is not too strong; it is quite pleasant.  It removes all the product and does not dry out my hair.  It cleanses it quite effectively, and leaves it shining, so much so that by the fourth day after shampooing, even with product in my hair and with no time to shampoo, I can wear it up and it still looks great.  I use it with a very small amount of marine biological conditioner (not on the roots), and I&#x27;m the happiest I&#x27;ve been with a shampoo in many years.  Plus the price is fantastic.</li>
            <li> Do not use it in areas that have heightened touch sensations unless you are prepared for a zing. It has similar effect to Icy Hot or Ben Gay. And we all know there are places those products are used with great caution, or not at all.</li>
            <li> Love the minty smell and it really gets your hair clean.</li>
            <li> This shampoo was either incredibly runny to start out with or became that way after sitting in the shower. Combined with the fact that it doesn&#x27;t lather well, this made it almost impossible to distribute throughout all of my hair. Usually with sulfate free shampoos I expect the difficulty to lather and some runniness, but this one was on the extreme for both. It&#x27;s just a total struggle trying to get all of your hair cleaned with this -- a few times after using it I&#x27;ve realized that there was a thick strand of unwashed hair on the back of my head later in the day. Unless you have very short, normal-to-slightly-oily hair, I do not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I love the way my hair shines and scalp feels because of the eucalyptus / organic ingredients. Shampoo cleans my hair nicely without leaving a film...awesome hair product and great price!</li>
            <li> This is a natural cleansing shampoo - for only $4 in the store. I have very long dry hair, but buildup from all the products I use and just oil from my scalp needs to be washed away weekly. After using this shampoo, I must use a good conditioner, as it will be SQUEAKY clean. I couldn&#x27;t use it all the time, as it would be too harsh, but is perfect for removing excess buildup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those who have oily hair - this would be perfect. I read reviews that this makes their hair brittle - well - yes, as there are no silicones or synthetic ingredients - its all natural products - just meant to cleanse. This will not make hair soft - it is only meant to cleanse. Be sure to use a conditioner afterwards!</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo. I went to trader&#x27;s joe looking for a shampoo that was paraben free and this shampoo was the only one (at least in my store). So I took it home and I just love it. It does not dry your hair and it doesn&#x27;t make it oily either. I can even spend three days without washing my hair and it does not look dirty or oily. It also helped me with my dandruff problem which is awesome. I did not wanted to buy any of those medicated shampoos because they said that they have chemicals that are not very good for your body, but after using this shampoo for two weeks the dandruff was gone! I would definitely recommend it to anyone, plus the price is low compared to other brands.</li>
            <li> I love that it is cruel free and contains a lot of goodness, hate that it is sub-par.  For the price and name (Trader Joe&#x27;s) I was very disappointed!  Will be doing the apple vinegar rinse instead!</li>
            <li> Loved it when I tried it while visiting my brother.  I bought some and then, I could not find it.  I will use sparingly.</li>
            <li> beautiful product for my hair</li>
            <li> As soon as used this product,we would not get any dandruff.&lt;br /&gt;Overall its a good product and I can suggest who are sufferinf from dandruff.</li>
            <li> This is a good shampoo.  You will notice with the first use.  It does give you the tingle and softens the hair!!</li>
            <li> This shampoo didn&#x27;t work any better than any other shampoo that I have used.  Might as well buy a less expensive shampoo.</li>
            <li> My husband has very sensitive skin and this was supposed to help him.  It has other ingredients than just tea tree oil gel that cause skin irritation.  Also it was way too expensive for the amount of product/quality you get.</li>
            <li> Tingly. Rejuvenating.&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t dry my hair/scalp out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though, I don&#x27;t use it every day.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think it should be used daily.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo it smells great and leaves your scalp feeling tingly and fresh. Great product would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like this product that much at all it really didn&#x27;t work for me it had a cleansing feel but didn&#x27;t help for my scalp</li>
            <li> OMGOSH!! Finally found a product with Tea Tree as the second ingrediant, believe me I have shopped, researched, stopped by stores like the Vitamin Shopp, Ulta (which they do carry organic products)and others. I looked at all the ingrediants and tea tree was always later down the ingrediant list.&lt;br /&gt;Giovanni is a great product, but this is even BETTER!! and it only cost $3.99 at Trader Joe&#x27;s. They sell the matching body wash, shampoo, and conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t believe I never checked Trader Joe&#x27;s and happy I did and at an great price for something that&#x27;s better than Giovanni!</li>
            <li> I have dandruff from time to time on my scalp and my eyebrows and a wash with this now and then seems to do a fairly good job of clearing it up, and at a fraction of the price of other teatree oil shampoos.</li>
            <li> This works really well on my rather oily hair, and leaves my hair very shiny and thoroughly clean. I wouldn&#x27;t use it on colored hair because of this deep cleansing action. My only negative is that the peppermint scent is really strong and stings your eyes...however, the scent leaves when hair is dry...It does a great job and I would recommend it for oily hair.</li>
            <li> I like it very much, and it&#x27;s all natural-organic etc etc. Now, it does sting your eyes if it gets in.</li>
            <li> This is one of the shampoos that is natural and gentle enough that I can actually use it without having my skin</li>
            <li> I bought this product because trader joes doesn&#x27;t test on animals and that is important to me. you can really feel the peppermint tingle your head when you use the shampoo. it does the job just fine</li>
            <li> Awesome Shampoo, keeps your hair shiny and healthy looking and have several natural oils that repel insects.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t live near a TJ&#x27;s anymore and all the other brands didn&#x27;t work as well - happy to pay price the price to get something quality that works on Amazon.  I had psoriasis and as long as I use tea tree oil it doesn&#x27;t act up as the peppermint is soothing and stops the itch and the tea tree actually heals.  I noticed someone said it is drying -- I have oily hair and can go a few days now between shampoos.</li>
            <li> Just realized that I mixed up the reviews for the shampoo and conditioner of this product. I bought this with the shampoo for my keratin-treated hair without realizing that the shampoo has sea salt, which I did not want. I love the conditioner very much, but will use if for my daughter&#x27;s natural hair.</li>
            <li> I purchased this shampoo because I thought I was getting a better deal on amazon but come to find out its only like $3.99 at trader joe&#x27;s and there is one in atlanta so I will be buying it there. Other than that, it felt amazing in my hair. I know clarifying shampoos have the tendency to make your hair feel dry but this one didn&#x27;t. My hair/scalp was clean without that dry/squeaky-clean feeling.</li>
            <li> Shampoo, i use it everyday and so should you. Great product. Smells great. Feels great. Enough said.</li>
            <li> Item as described -- fast delivery.</li>
            <li> HORRIBLE ! My scalp was so itchy from this shampoo. Because of the itching, my scalp has sores now. I only used it once, that was enough for me. To expensive for it to not work &amp; I returned it. My husband did use it once for his beard (lol) &amp; liked it.</li>
            <li> I have naturally oily skin and scalp, so I&#x27;m very prone to pimples and dandruff. I&#x27;m a person who likes to only use all natural products. I don&#x27;t like to use products that have any unnecessary ingredients just because they make the product foam better, or have a better color, at the cost of putting poison into our bodies. Anyways, this product. Anyways, this product is MOSTLY free of bad ingredients. It only has one ingredient in it that I consider to be harmful to your health:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;COCAMIDOPROPYL BETAINE - Not by itself very harmful to health unless you have allergies, but it also has contaminates in it such as NITROSAMINES which is carcinogenic (Radiocative, an cause cancer).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, there are some other chemicals in it like SODIUM HYDROXYMETHYLGLYCINATE,and 12-14 OLEFIN SULFONATE that can possibly cause allergic reactions. Also, it is possible to be allergic to some of the other natural oils in the product, so make sure you aren&#x27;t allergic to any of the ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the product itself, it&#x27;s very nice. It smells strongly like peppermint, and is very invigorating. It clears the oil from my hair nicely, and I have naturally oily hair. I also have Scalp Seborrhea which is one of the main causes of dandruff. The Tea Tree Oil in this product helps get rid of this, so if you have dandruff, this could possibly help you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall it works, has very minimal health risk ingredients, smells very nice, cleans well, and helps get rid of dandruff. I would reccomend this product to anyone who has Scalp Seborrhea and likes to only use products that don&#x27;t have harmful ingredients in them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a final note, just go to Trader Joe&#x27;s to buy it, it&#x27;s like 4-5 bucks.</li>
            <li> It gets your hair squeaky clean for a sls free shampoo. If you continue using it, it will dry your hair out. I used it a lot. It may not do the same for someone who uses it once a month. I have 3b/c/4a hair.</li>
            <li> Love this for my curly hair!!!</li>
            <li> Smells great &amp; I love the tingle but it still has some sulfate in it so I can&#x27;t use it daily due to sulfate allergy.</li>
            <li> I like this shampoo.  It&#x27;s supposedly organic and I like the thought of not putting poison in my hair.  This gets my fine, thin hair clean and looking great.  If you have a trader joe&#x27;s nearby it is a lot cheaper than ordering online.</li>
            <li> Discovered this at Trader Joe&#x27;s and can now order it through Amazon.  Wonderful fragrance, like nothing I&#x27;ve used before.  My niece loves it, too.</li>
            <li> I give this product two stars because it made my hair smell great, but made it feel like straw. This product (with my experiences) does not aid in natural African American hair. It made mine dry and straw like and impossible to manage. If I use this, it would have to be mixed with an all natural conditioner.</li>
            <li> I had bought a different brand mint shampoo at Tuesday morning and had liked it. This time the smell was nice but sometimes I get bumps on scalp after using.</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo...makes my hair soft and shiny!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what the deal is with this shampoo but it dries my hair out faster than any shampoo I have ever used. My hair is a knotted mess after using this, even with an additional shampoo rinse and conditioner. I broke my brush trying to get the knots out. It&#x27;s even tangled while I&#x27;m still in the shower and almost feels like a clarifying shampoo with out dry and bare my hair is after using. Wish I could return it.</li>
            <li> I tried it once, the feeling is that it is good</li>
            <li> love the scent! good shampoo. of course; it&#x27;s trader joe&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> So far so good.  Doesn&#x27;t dry my hair as badly as some shampoos.  Smells nice.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s second purchase. I love it&#x27;s &amp;#34;Cruelty free&amp;#34; part.</li>
            <li> love the refreshing sensation on my scalp.</li>
            <li> Good product, shipped fast.  I love the tingling feeling I get when I use it.</li>
            <li> Love the clean feeling I get from using this shampoo.  If you are looking for a shampoo that will strip all the added oil, gels and other things we put in our hair during the week, this is it.  I normally follow up with the tree tee conditioner which will bring the soft silky feeling back into your hair.</li>
            <li> It feels great and refreshing after using this product, so I wouldn&#x27;t mind purchasing it again. We I like it</li>
            <li> I bought this shampoo about a month ago from Trader Joes I was looking for something to help with my itchy scalp, it definitely gets your hair squeaky clean, i didnt feel the tingle everyone is talking about. I thinks its good to use maybe once or twice a month to get all the mousse, oils, pomades or whatever you use completley out of your hair, I&#x27;ve started putting tea tree oil on my scalp and let it sit for a while or overnight and the itchyness has diminished, I havent tried the conditioner they didnt have it but they did have the nourish love the nourish. So i gave it a 3 because no tingle, cant beat the price, if you have a Trader joes in your area its only $2.99a</li>
            <li> i purchased this because it was cheaper than the large 1L green bottle that i usually buy. I was hoping to save money but it just dosn&#x27;t work the same. It&#x27;s a fine shampoo and conditioner but not in the same league or even same galaxy as the Paul Mitchell one. I&#x27;m going back to the other stuff. Cost more but is awesome</li>
            <li> I started using this shampoo over a year ago, it has always delivered. My hair is shiny, smells great and my head is itch free. Several of my friends are now users and all agree it is great.</li>
            <li> My hair changed a lot while I was pregnant, and I was looking for something that wouldn&#x27;t dry it out, but would do a good job of cleaning my extra-thick hormone-powered mane. This shampoo did the trick. And the peppermint oil lends a refreshing scent that both perked me up on tired mornings and helped soothe dry or congested sinuses during the winter months. Too bad I don&#x27;t have a Trader Joe&#x27;s closer than 2 hours away, I don&#x27;t think I can justify the price to continue buying it online.</li>
            <li> I really like how this makes my hair feel, but additionally, it doesn&#x27;t cause breakouts on my shoulders like commercial hair products seem to for me.  I was surprised, but when I switched to this, my skin really cleared up.  Then I stayed the weekend at a friend&#x27;s and used her shampoo, and broke out again across my shoulders.  I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s the sodium laurel sulfates or what in other shampoos, but I just stick with this and enjoy better skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shampoo does take a little bit getting used to, as it doesn&#x27;t lather quite as much as froofy drug-store brands, and it can make your ends feel dry if you use a lot of it every day.  I don&#x27;t always shampoo every day, and sometimes I just use a little on my roots and that&#x27;s it. The conditioner is not quite as thick and penetrating as one might prefer if they have really dry hair, but for me it does the trick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other reviewers say that they have had bad skin reactions to this, and that very well may be the case--there are a lot of essential oils and whatnot that might be too strong for some.  I think you really just have to give it a try.  Either it will work great, or it won&#x27;t be for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I really like this as a cheap (not on amazon), natural shampoo that works well for my skin and hair.  I had messed around with homemade shampoo recipes, but did not have success.  This is a nice compromise.</li>
            <li> I enjoy the product very much. It is all that it was promised to be and the price was good.</li>
            <li> Nice shampoo love peppermint in any product just love how it tingles and cleans my hair just using one wash.</li>
            <li> Strips your hair hardcore and fades color.</li>
            <li> First the smell of this shampoo is amazing! The smell lingers after the shower too, which is great. Energizing smell. Perfect for son / anyone with dandruff. Strongly recommend</li>
            <li> Looking for an economical alternative to similar Paul Mitchell products and found it with TJ Tee Tree shampoo.  The &amp;#34;tingle&amp;#34; is about 2/3 as intense as the PM version, so it can be more of a daily use shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great feel with the tingle and leaves my hair smelling and looking great.</li>
            <li> Not as strong as I hoped</li>
            <li> It is hard to find a shampoo that is not loaded with chemicals that really works well on your hair, but this one is great.&lt;br /&gt;It has a wonderful smell. My daughter borrowed it and said she had less split hairs.</li>
            <li> I noticed after using this a few times that it was leaving white spots on my shower curtain, even though I rinse it after every shower.  (This never happened with my previous shampoo [[ASIN:B001339RX4 Shampoo-Oil &amp; Fragrance Free - 16 oz.]], which I stopped using because the formula kept getting more and more watery.)  If that&#x27;s what it&#x27;s doing to my shower curtain, what&#x27;s it doing to my hair and skin?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I liked the way it smells and the way it made my hair look and feel, but....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The spots haven&#x27;t come off with a couple of rounds of vinegar spray and rinse - I haven&#x27;t tried any more drastic measures yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the shampoo I&#x27;m using now, and I like the smell and feel even better - I have pretty itchy skin, and this fixes it right up.  [[ASIN:B00068LVUY Original Sprout Hair and Body Wash - 12 oz.]]  Can&#x27;t tell if this one spots until I either clean the shower curtain successfully or get a new one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edited to add that the Original Sprout not only doesn&#x27;t spot the shower curtain, it eventually cleaned away the spots left by the Trader Joe&#x27;s.  Also handles my itchiness better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regarding negative reviews - I find it interesting that virtually all of them have been voted \\&quot;not helpful,\\&quot; considering that most are quite detailed and, to me, helpful.  I wonder what&#x27;s going on here?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 4a/4b African- American natural and I&#x27;ve used this shampoo for years now. It is not my favorite, but it is indeed a go to for a fresh clean feel and on days when there&#x27;s buildup -- tea tree oil is good for that.  It&#x27;s invigorating. Like others mentioned, it&#x27;s only $3.99 at Trader Joe&#x27;s...Amazon is trying to pull a fast one.</li>
            <li> I ran out to Trader Joe&#x27;s to buy both the shampoo and conditioner based on all the good reviews. I didn&#x27;t get barely any of a tingle sensation. My scalp still itches and it made my hair feel horrible. I couldn&#x27;t even run a brush through it to save my life. Back to the drawing board.</li>
            <li> Great product, great store. It really does tingle! WOW! I wish there were a Trader Joe&#x27;s nearer my house.</li>
            <li> Helped clear up my daughter&#x27;s dandruff and she loves the smell. If you don&#x27;t like a minty smell, probably not for you, as it is a very strong scent.</li>
            <li> This is a good product; makes your hair soft and a great feeling on the scalp.  I recommend to people with silver, or platinum, hair as it does not leave a color residue, ie  green, orange, red tinted shampoo.</li>
            <li> Great for any type of hair especially loc hairstyles.  Have been using this for quite sometime and does not disappoint.  Does not sulfate laureate which strips your hair of the natural oils.  Since I am not close to a Trader&#x27;s Joe, I order that product.</li>
