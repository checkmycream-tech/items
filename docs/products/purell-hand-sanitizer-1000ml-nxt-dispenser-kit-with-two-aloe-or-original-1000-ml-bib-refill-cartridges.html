            <li>Very happy</li>
            <li>Perfect.  </li>
            <li>and I am very happy with it</li>
            <li>so I say get this because it came perfect</li>
            <li>I take care of children, and feel it is the best way to try to reduce the spread of germs in my home.  </li>
            <li>I Was very happy with this product and loved how it came with the dispenser along with 2 hand sanitizer.  </li>
            <li>and this is just great.</li>
            <li>Great product for a house.</li>
            <li>GREAT PRICE</li>

            <li>i feel it is a good value.</li>

            <li>It looks good and I am pleased with the ease of set up and that I was pumping product in minutes.  </li>
            <li>They were very easy to install.</li>
            <li>The refill bags were very easy to put in.</li>
            <li>Easy to install and in my case, invaluable!</li>
            <li>as advertised fits perfect and aloe version is better on the hands if used often, every house should have one put near entrance to prevent bringing germs into property.</li>
            <li>Great product, shipped  quickly, and easy to install with the hope they will help keep the flu out of my house.</li>
            <li>I love the hand dispenser and am saving money over the pump bottles.  </li>
            <li>Great product, good price, only problem I had was when I was moving from the house I had it in</li>
            <li>Thanks for a great price and an outstanding product.</li>
            <li>and I LOVE them.</li>
            <li>Works great on the boat or at the door for those quick clean up times.  </li>
            <li>I am not one of those people that makes everyone was their hands before touching my kid or anything.</li>
            <li>They were very nice, personable and I highly recommend.  </li>
            <li>Everyone was so excited to see it--it&#x27;s been a hit!</li>
            <li>product was easy to assemble and use,I just attached it to the wall with the sticky tape, slid in the gill bag</li>
            <li>It was installed in minutes, and the refill pouches were easy to insert.</li>
            <li>The product arrived within 7-days and is easy to install and refill.</li>
            <li>Cheap and easy to install too.</li>
            <li>maybe i should get lotion dispensers next lol.</li>
            <li>so might as well secure it now.</li>
            <li>Now everyone can be germ-free before touching baby--and it&#x27;s quick and fun.  </li>
            <li>The installation was quick and pain free.</li>
            <li>We purchased three for our home and our preemie daughter has been healthy all through flu season, even with three older brothers in the house!  </li>
            <li>This became the stopping point for all parents entering the preschool for a quick cleanup before dropping off and picking up.</li>
            <li>It reminds visitors who come to see the new baby to wash before touching.</li>
            <li>Well worth it.  </li>
            <li>I already had a NXT dispenser but ran out of the sanitizer, so this deal right here made it work out</li>
            <li>Also, I have found that all of our guests use it too since it is right by the door which wasn&#x27;t even my intention.</li>
            <li>the dispensers are only 6 dollars on amazon, how great is that, so yea i buy the refills for as low price as i can.  </li>
            <li>Exactly as advertised...</li>
            <li>And using the name brand like this does work better than generic.</li>
            <li>More economic than individual pumps</li>
            <li>i have not tried the aloe yet, but will soon, straight alcohol dries hands out.  </li>
            <li>I peeled the tape back, placed on the wall then used screws to secure to the wall.</li>
            <li>This pump is just like the ones they use in the hospital and is very user-friendly for both adults and children.  </li>
            <li>bought these to be installed around our church facility - well appreciated by everyone and when installed,  are visible and not overly so...</li>
            <li>and I really think it has helped minimize the amount of illnesses going around our house.</li>
            <li>It was cheap and comes with 2 big bags of hand sanitizer.</li>
            <li>I particularly like the aloe added in, as I am sure the disinfectant is probably not gentle on our skin.  </li>
            <li>These devices are pretty big and they are brownish in color like you see at offices or restrooms so not very attractive but to stay more germ free I will suffer with the eye sore.</li>
            <li>The main advantage of the dispenser is that it is just like the ones they have in the hospital.  </li>
            <li>She has yet to get an infection that could land her back in the hospital quite quickly.</li>
            <li>really recommend this to anyone, its a lot of savings from buying small bottles at grocery stores and more convenient.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>but I did not want to leave this new side</li>
            <li>My 5 month old daughter was diagnosed with a rare liver disease, Biliary Atresia, June 10, 2008; when she was only 7 weeks old.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised and even joked about it with him.</li>
            <li>When we brought our premature daughter home from the hospital, we wanted the safest environment for her, so we required everyone who entered the house or came near her to hand-sanitize.  </li>
            <li>and I think it looks classy too.</li>
            <li>wall mount was easy, and means small footprint .</li>
            <li>I tried washing my hands everyday when I got home before picking my son up but when he got to the age that he was crawling he would crawl to me excited and want to be picked up</li>
            <li>Due to this mess, we have not been able to use.</li>

            <li> So said no thank you to the guaranteed mess waiting to happen.</li>
            <li> I opted for these instead of automatic because there were a lot of complaints of the automatics wasting batteries and going off all the time with just mere motion NEAR the machine.</li>

            <li> Im not a huge sanitizer user</li>

            <li> and it was hard to run away from him to go to the bathroom to wash my hands while he was crying.</li>
            <li> read some reviews about service being bad buy the shippers, but in my case I really can&#x27;t say that.</li>

            <li> wrong refill bags and the supplier does not seem to understand the product and the specifications.</li>
            <li> I hate to pull it out from the wall because it would leave a hole on the wall.</li>

            <li> This became the stopping point for all parents entering the preschool for a quick cleanup before dropping off and picking up. More economic than individual pumps and it doesn&#x27;t get lost.</li>

            <li> I placed three orders with this company, one for 2 Dispensers, one for two 1000 ML Gel refill and one for 1000 ML NXT KIT that includes on dispenser and one 1000 ML gel refill. within three days from my order, I received the order (as complete) but it was missing the 1000 ML NXT KIT. I immediately notified the company and received a feed back that they will send me one. Four days late, I received the order that made it complete.&lt;br /&gt;The product was easy to assemble and use,I just attached it to the wall with the sticky tape, slid in the gill bag and that was it. I have dispensers in the work area since we handle cash quite often and this is just great. The third dispenser I will give to my daughter so she can use in her kitchen at home.&lt;br /&gt;I really recommend this to anyone, its a lot of savings from buying small bottles at grocery stores and more convenient.&lt;br /&gt;I read some reviews about service being bad buy the shippers, but in my case I really can&#x27;t say that. They were just awesome.</li>
            <li> After the cartridge was put in the gel only come out occasionally. And it leaked and created a small puddle on the carpet floor. I hate to pull it out from the wall because it would leave a hole on the wall. I regret that I brought it.</li>
            <li> I received the Purell NXT Dispenser, but did not receive the two NXT BIB 1000ml Refills. Had to look elsewhere to order them.</li>
            <li> I love the hand dispenser and am saving money over the pump bottles.  The main advantage of the dispenser is that it is just like the ones they have in the hospital.  It reminds visitors who come to see the new baby to wash before touching.</li>
            <li> With a newborn in the house, we ordered and installed the Purell dispenser in a central location in our house.  Now everyone can be germ-free before touching baby--and it&#x27;s quick and fun.  Cheap and easy to install too.</li>
            <li> I bought this for our nursery at church. Everyone was so excited to see it--it&#x27;s been a hit! It was installed in minutes, and the refill pouches were easy to insert. Worked immediately. Haven&#x27;t had it long, so I can&#x27;t say how it will stand the test of time.</li>
            <li> Great product for a house. Saves a lot of money when compared to buying single bottles !</li>
            <li> With the flu going around I used the adhesive and mounted it on the door between the garage and kitchen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Works great and easy to install.</li>
            <li> Great product, good price, only problem I had was when I was moving from the house I had it in I couldn&#x27;t get it off the wall. Aside from that though it works as advertised and the sanitizer bags last a long time, it took me months to get through a single refill bag.</li>
            <li> the dispensers are only 6 dollars on amazon, how great is that, so yea i buy the refills for as low price as i can.  i have not tried the aloe yet, but will soon, straight alcohol dries hands out.  maybe i should get lotion dispensers next lol.</li>
            <li> My 5 month old daughter was diagnosed with a rare liver disease, Biliary Atresia, June 10, 2008; when she was only 7 weeks old. She had an operation to save her life, the Kasai procedure, on June 13, 2008. While in the hospital we had to take extreme precaution not to infect her by sanitizing with this product. We were told that this would have to continue when my daughter came home. We have taken this advice quite seriously. I ordered these for every room in my home while she was still in the hospital. She has yet to get an infection that could land her back in the hospital quite quickly. Everyone that enters my home has to use these as if they were at the hospital and it has done the trick. I would recommend these to any parent out there that may have a child at risk- or for that mater- any child. These are the same they use in the hospital. Easy to install and in my case, invaluable! This product won&#x27;t ruin your hands like other sanitizers we&#x27;ve been forced to use either. - Amy Kleebank</li>
            <li> Mail lost order but company was great and rushed delivery of replacement!  They were very nice, personable and I highly recommend.  Have not seen a company take such personal interest before!</li>
            <li> I purchased this dispenser for someone who was not so sanitizing. However, one day this person was visiting someone in the hospital and every time he would see this dispenser, he would use it. I was pleasantly surprised and even joked about it with him. Well, the person left the hospital but I did not want to leave this new side I was seeing so I ordered this product for his home.    He LOVES it and cracked up when he opened it up. He now uses it all the time.</li>
            <li> I have 3 of these - in my 2 bathrooms and in the kitchen. If you use hand sanitizer a lot or have kids this is the way to go. It&#x27;s WAY cheaper than having pump bottles around and reduces the clutter on the sink. Price is excellent on this kit and refills by the case are cheaper too.</li>
            <li> I have recently been diagnosed with cancer and have turned into a germaphobe.  My wife was skeptical whether we would use a dispenser, why not just wash your hands...  I mounted it by the back entry door and use it multiple time a day, especially when coming in from outside...      Purell seems to be the GOLD STANDARD, and every hospital and medical office I visit, I hit the Purell Sanitizer on the way out... and sometimes on the way in... and sometimes after handling things and opening doors...    GREAT PRICE TOO</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product. The installation was quick and pain free. I used a level, squared it off and just pushed it on the wall.  As an added messure, Iinstalled 2 screws.  It looks good and I am pleased with the ease of set up and that I was pumping product in minutes.  Thanks for a great price and an outstanding product.</li>
            <li> The combination of dispenser and refill are not compatible. wrong refill bags and the supplier does not seem to understand the product and the specifications. Due to this mess, we have not been able to use. Do not  use adhesive to stick to the wall as you can not remove it without damaging the wall. Just use simple screws.</li>
            <li> I have had my two Purcell dispensers for 3 months now and I LOVE them. I ordered two and each dispenser came with two refills. They arrived as promised. And in perfect condition. I have one in the kitchen and one in the guest bathroom. With two refills still left over for replacement. They were very easy to install. They have a sticky tape backing and a screw wall mount section on back. I used both. I peeled the tape back, placed on the wall then used screws to secure to the wall. Both may not have been necessary but I figured I wasn&#x27;t going to move it later so might as well secure it now. The refill bags were very easy to put in. Just feed the nozzle through the opening on the inside of  the machine like instructed and adjust bag inside square to close lid and your done. To help my kids to remember to use them I give out reward tickets if I \\&quot;smell\\&quot; that someone has used it without being reminded. Seems to be working like a charm. And using the name brand like this does work better than generic. Some generics really dry out the hands. Not these. These devices are pretty big and they are brownish in color like you see at offices or restrooms so not very attractive but to stay more germ free I will suffer with the eye sore. They are also not automatic so you do have to compress button with the palm of your hand to use. I opted for these instead of automatic because there were a lot of complaints of the automatics wasting batteries and going off all the time with just mere motion NEAR the machine. So said no thank you to the guaranteed mess waiting to happen. Not to mention waste of product. Hope this helped.</li>
            <li> Im not a huge sanitizer user but I put the dispencer on the outside of my garage door so before you enter you can be sanitized. I wash my hands and my kids hands when we get home from being out anywhere but for others who dont practice that way then this is another option.</li>
            <li> When we brought our premature daughter home from the hospital, we wanted the safest environment for her, so we required everyone who entered the house or came near her to hand-sanitize.  This pump is just like the ones they use in the hospital and is very user-friendly for both adults and children.  We purchased three for our home and our preemie daughter has been healthy all through flu season, even with three older brothers in the house!  The product arrived within 7-days and is easy to install and refill.</li>
            <li> Works great on the boat or at the door for those quick clean up times.  Well worth it.  Very happy</li>
            <li> Only problem was that the product came with no instructions.  Had to figure out how to open the dispenser and install the bag of disinfectant into the dispenser.</li>
            <li> I Was very happy with this product and loved how it came with the dispenser along with 2 hand sanitizer.  For some reason I thought I was only ordering 1 box of sanitizer.  So when it came in, I was very happy and pleased to see I had gotten a great deal.  I already had a NXT dispenser but ran out of the sanitizer, so this deal right here made it work out Perfect.  Now I have 2 dispenser at my gym and I am very happy with it and so are my customers.  Very nice looking on the walls and I think it looks classy too. Thank you!!</li>
            <li> I use this at my shop it is great and works and that matters so I say get this because it came perfect</li>
            <li> Great product, shipped  quickly, and easy to install with the hope they will help keep the flu out of my house.</li>
            <li> I have three Purell dispensers in my home.  I take care of children, and feel it is the best way to try to reduce the spread of germs in my home.  I particularly like the aloe added in, as I am sure the disinfectant is probably not gentle on our skin.  This is the lowest cost I have found for this product!!!</li>
            <li> bought this to hang in a half bath we have off kitchen. i feel it is a good value. wall mount was easy, and means small footprint . would recomend</li>
            <li> bought these to be installed around our church facility - well appreciated by everyone and when installed,  are visible and not overly so...</li>
            <li> After going back to work when my son was 4 months old we were all getting sick constantly. I decided to put this by the door and I really think it has helped minimize the amount of illnesses going around our house. I tried washing my hands everyday when I got home before picking my son up but when he got to the age that he was crawling he would crawl to me excited and want to be picked up and it was hard to run away from him to go to the bathroom to wash my hands while he was crying. So this has been a life saver. Also, I have found that all of our guests use it too since it is right by the door which wasn&#x27;t even my intention. I am not one of those people that makes everyone was their hands before touching my kid or anything. But I think ppl are curtious and just see it there and assume we would prefer they use it so they do. It was cheap and comes with 2 big bags of hand sanitizer. This is way cheaper then buying the pumps at the store.</li>
