    <ol>
            <li>It works great!</li>
            <li>at it&#x27;s best, considering I just bought a 3-pack from Amazon a couple of months ago for $21.57 ($7.19 each)!!</li>
            <li>Works as advertised, an uncommon feat these days, but I have to use all of the product just to cover moustache and goatee.</li>
            <li>(I had to use a pair of pliers to get them removed), but the product itself is great.  </li>
            <li>is great.  </li>
            <li>This is the best match for me, and I haven&#x27;t been able to find this color in stores.</li>
            <li>Still, it is the best that I have been able to find.</li>
            <li>Love how my husband looks with this hair color &amp;#34;dark blonde/lightest brown&amp;#34; HANDSOME!!!</li>
            <li>This color is the best match if you have medium to light brown hair.</li>
            <li>Works really great and is a nice color.  </li>
            <li>so I think it looks good and matches my hair color.</li>
            <li>This arrived on time and in good condition.  </li>
            <li>color looks great, and it&#x27;s easy to apply.</li>
            <li>It was nice to see that I could find it here</li>
            <li>Very easy to use ,didn&#x27;t burned me .My</li>
            <li>Okay that&#x27;s 12 and women love  me because of it!</li>
            <li>Product was as described, works great by giving great coverage, and last for weeks before you have to reapply it</li>
            <li>This seems to be reformulated, so that it does work better (lasts a bit longer).</li>
            <li>I tried several of the shades which all require two applications to get the best coverage.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for my beard and mustache for 18 years and love it.  </li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll be pleased with the results and color match.</li>
            <li>What can I say in 20 or more words about hair dye?</li>
            <li>I was concerned because I have psoriasis on my scalp, so I wasn&#x27;t sure if it would irritate the skin under my beard.</li>
            <li>I decided to buy more, this time from Amazon&#x27;s Subscribe &amp; Save program.</li>
            <li>It is more of a light brown.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is easy to apply and gives you control over the desired color depth.</li>
            <li>Previously, I&#x27;d try and find the best price at Walmart</li>
            <li>/&gt;I am 56 and have super sensitive skin, razor bumps like a beast and always in search of great products.  </li>
            <li>Fortunately it didn&#x27;t, even after going through all four applications in the box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My hair is light brown/red.  </li>
            <li>In other words I&#x27;m a real guy who is very happy with the product w/o any complaints.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t burn mine in the least and this stuff is the best out there.  </li>
            <li>I wish that I could return this product for a full refund.</li>
            <li>When buying from the local drug stores I&#x27;ve only been able to find the color called &amp;#34;light brown&amp;#34; whereas here I was able to buy &#x27;darkest blonde/lightest brown&#x27; which is a better fit for my native beard color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;After reading the reviews of many Amazon reviews I&#x27;m very surprised to see people complaining about this product.  </li>
            <li>It will match your hair almost exactly.</li>
            <li>For Men&amp;#34; beard coloring gels for about 8 or 9 years although this is the first time I&#x27;ve purchased them through Amazon.  </li>
            <li>but they don&#x27;t have the same range of color choices as I was able to find here.  </li>
            <li>He uses the box for mustache color only and does both the hair and mustache since it&#x27;s thicker and stays on better.</li>
            <li>First off, I&#x27;ve never been allergic to anything except ragweed in the fall.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it for anyone who wants his beard/mustache to match a light-brown/dark-blonde hair color!!</li>
            <li>no other product available for men that works as well.  </li>
            <li>and now I can purchase it at a much lower price.</li>
            <li>I wonder how much they (Amazon) has in stock?</li>
            <li>it really covers the gray but he does leave in his hair for almost an hour.</li>
            <li>much prefer a product that took longer and didn&#x27;t tear up my face.</li>
            <li>Its much better than M-25, which is too dark if you happen to forget its in and go over by a min or two</li>
            <li>Also, the delivered price through Amazon is a couple of dollars less than what I&#x27;m able to get locally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is the perfect color for me, and one that is virtually impossible to find in stores.  </li>
            <li>I think the company is no longer making this particular color.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Great product, but a $65.70 price for one kit is totally ridiculous!!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not crazy about the price, but it&#x27;s the only choice out there, as far as I can tell.</li>
            <li>I really like it and would rather not mix two other products the currently make; blond and light brown.  </li>
            <li>Ok if I put a little bit into the hair on my head (or what&#x27;s left of it!)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard to find this shade in stores and costs more as well.</li>
            <li>But I can&#x27;t recommend it for anyone who has sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>would stay far away from this.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use this product not only in my goatee but for the grays which are forming right above my ears towards the front.  </li>
            <li>no one is going to believe a completely light brown or dark blonde beard at my age.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t really consider it a blond when covering over grey.  </li>
            <li>white areas diminished and  the look was very natural .The</li>
            <li>I have dark blonde hair which in the summer turns quite a light blonde color.  </li>
            <li>Part of my beard has been almost white since my early 20&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t want to look old, and this product helps me to look younger.  </li>
            <li>you can see, I&#x27;m a real purchaser of this &amp;#34;Just for Men&amp;#34; through Amazon and you can also look up the other products I&#x27;ve reviewed.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve not personally had any problems as far as allergy goes, though it can stain the skin a little at the time, but going around after with a flannel/cloth and some soap soon removes it with a gentle rub.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve never had any trouble getting multiple uses as long as I&#x27;ve been careful to squeeze all air out of the tubes before putting them away for the next use.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately despite being the lightest brown available tends to color my beard a bit too dark.  </li>
            <li> It makes a paste that you brush on, which doesn&#x27;t drip like hair color, so there is no big mess.</li>
            <li> only thing is that the color is a little darker than i expected.</li>
            <li> Since those hairs are not as thick as facial hair, do them last.  </li>
            <li> Maybe next time i put it less than 5 minutes to be less darker.</li>
            <li> I do need to leave a few patches of grey now...</li>
            <li> But after a few applications of this (and I used it correctly, not overdosing or leaving it on too long)</li>
            <li> Some tend to get too dark.</li>
            <li> I have light-medium brown hair color and wanted my beard to be dark blond.</li>
            <li> The caps to the two tubes are somewhat tightly screwed on</li>
            <li> Apply heavily too stubborn areas and comb thru with a comb, to coat all the hairs.  </li>
            <li> I wondered if the first box was just a bad batch, but the second box was even worse.</li>
            <li> For some reason, the first box in the three pack irritated the skin under my beard so bad that it oozed for two days.</li>
            <li> The trouble is, it&#x27;s hard to find that shade in stores, and impossible since I moved here to Bulgaria from the UK, so ordering online is the only option.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just what I ordered, A hard to find color on the shelf.</li>
            <li> It was hard to get a color match</li>
            <li> but this color, which without ordering here, is quite hard to find.  </li>
            <li> You get at least 4 to 5 applications.</li>
            <li> It can work out a bit pricey, what with the shipping costs added, but at least I get 4 applications per box.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t always have to do this though, depends on how clumsy I am applying it at the time.</li>
            <li> In fact, I literally don&#x27;t believe the bulk of the negative reviews.  </li>
            <li> now, when i use it my face itches like crazy and i&#x27;ve seen red blister like places on my face.  </li>
            <li> However, it&#x27;s a bit mor irritating to the skin and just as messy as before.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s driving me crazy.  </li>
            <li> The ooze is so bad that my shirt collar is soaked.</li>
            <li> The worst product I have ever used!*****WARNING</li>

            <li> This seems to be reformulated, so that it does work better (lasts a bit longer). However, it&#x27;s a bit mor irritating to the skin and just as messy as before. I&#x27;m not crazy about the price, but it&#x27;s the only choice out there, as far as I can tell.</li>
            <li> I tried several of the shades which all require two applications to get the best coverage. Some tend to get too dark. This color is the best match if you have medium to light brown hair. It will match your hair almost exactly. It makes a paste that you brush on, which doesn&#x27;t drip like hair color, so there is no big mess. Apply heavily too stubborn areas and comb thru with a comb, to coat all the hairs.  It has never stained my skin or irritated it at all. Just shampoo out in the shower. You get at least 4 to 5 applications. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I have used the Just for Men brush in gel for a number of years,  But when I buy it locally it costs me over $8 a box.  Through Amazon, including shipping, it cost me about $6.20.  I have always felt that the product worked well and now I can purchase it at a much lower price.</li>
            <li> The worst product I have ever used!*****WARNING***** Do not use this product! It will harm you! They need to be sued!!!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just what I ordered, A hard to find color on the shelf. It was nice to see that I could find it here</li>
            <li> Here is the color you cannot find at Walmart or Kroger... It works great! and lasts..... Its much better than M-25, which is too dark if you happen to forget its in and go over by a min or two</li>
            <li> Have used this for years.  Consistantly the same........no other product available for men that works as well.  Always go with one shade lighter than you wish to have.</li>
            <li> I like to use the lightest brown shade, I have used the others at a push, but they make me look like Bluto. The trouble is, it&#x27;s hard to find that shade in stores, and impossible since I moved here to Bulgaria from the UK, so ordering online is the only option. It can work out a bit pricey, what with the shipping costs added, but at least I get 4 applications per box. I&#x27;ve not personally had any problems as far as allergy goes, though it can stain the skin a little at the time, but going around after with a flannel/cloth and some soap soon removes it with a gentle rub. I don&#x27;t always have to do this though, depends on how clumsy I am applying it at the time.</li>
            <li> Works as advertised, an uncommon feat these days, but I have to use all of the product just to cover moustache and goatee.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for years...never a problem.  I do need to leave a few patches of grey now...no one is going to believe a completely light brown or dark blonde beard at my age.</li>

            <li> Works really great and is a nice color.  Don&#x27;t really consider it a blond when covering over grey.  It is more of a light brown.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am 56 and have super sensitive skin, razor bumps like a beast and always in search of great products.  As was said before this color only found on amazon.  As for the people saying it burned their skin, don&#x27;t get it.  Doesn&#x27;t burn mine in the least and this stuff is the best out there.  Do mine once a week or so and I too reuse the tubes.  I probably get one month out of each kit.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for my beard and mustache for 18 years and love it.  It is easy to apply and gives you control over the desired color depth.</li>
            <li> I have dark blonde hair which in the summer turns quite a light blonde color.  It was hard to get a color match but this color, which without ordering here, is quite hard to find.  I use this product not only in my goatee but for the grays which are forming right above my ears towards the front.  Since those hairs are not as thick as facial hair, do them last.  You&#x27;ll be pleased with the results and color match.</li>
            <li> The chemical burns are horrid.  Blisters, swelling, and itching beyond belief.</li>
            <li> I think the company is no longer making this particular color.  I really like it and would rather not mix two other products the currently make; blond and light brown.  I wonder how much they (Amazon) has in stock?</li>
            <li> Love how my husband looks with this hair color &amp;#34;dark blonde/lightest brown&amp;#34; HANDSOME!!! he does his hair about every 3-4 weeks it really covers the gray but he does leave in his hair for almost an hour. He uses the box for mustache color only and does both the hair and mustache since it&#x27;s thicker and stays on better.</li>
            <li> This is the perfect color for me, and one that is virtually impossible to find in stores.  The caps to the two tubes are somewhat tightly screwed on (I had to use a pair of pliers to get them removed), but the product itself is great.  I highly recommend it for anyone who wants his beard/mustache to match a light-brown/dark-blonde hair color!!</li>
            <li> I like this product and the price is great.  Part of my beard has been almost white since my early 20&#x27;s.  That part I just apply the color about 2 minutes earlier and everything blends in.  Still have different colors in my bread so I think it looks good and matches my hair color.</li>
            <li> Product was as described, works great by giving great coverage, and last for weeks before you have to reapply it</li>
            <li> What can I say in 20 or more words about hair dye? Okay that&#x27;s 12 and women love  me because of it!</li>
            <li> i think they changed the formula.  now, when i use it my face itches like crazy and i&#x27;ve seen red blister like places on my face.  it&#x27;s driving me crazy.  can anyone recommend another beard dye?</li>
            <li> I initially bought this product from a local store. I was concerned because I have psoriasis on my scalp, so I wasn&#x27;t sure if it would irritate the skin under my beard. Fortunately it didn&#x27;t, even after going through all four applications in the box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I decided to buy more, this time from Amazon&#x27;s Subscribe &amp; Save program. For some reason, the first box in the three pack irritated the skin under my beard so bad that it oozed for two days. My wife bought me analgesic burn gel, which helped, but it took a week for the irritation to go away. I wondered if the first box was just a bad batch, but the second box was even worse. The ooze is so bad that my shirt collar is soaked. My skin also is puffed up, red and itchy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The color looks great, and it&#x27;s easy to apply. But I can&#x27;t recommend it for anyone who has sensitive skin. I wish that I could return this product for a full refund. If I ever get the nerve to try this product again, I&#x27;ll buy it from a local store. But for now, I&#x27;m going back to gray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Five stars for the color and zero for the irritation works out to an overall rating of about 2.5 stars.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want to look old, and this product helps me to look younger.  I order three at a time because that  is how they are packaged.  My hair is light brown/red.  This is the best match for me, and I haven&#x27;t been able to find this color in stores.</li>
            <li> Great product, but a $65.70 price for one kit is totally ridiculous!!  This is &amp;#34;gouging&amp;#34; at it&#x27;s best, considering I just bought a 3-pack from Amazon a couple of months ago for $21.57 ($7.19 each)!!</li>
            <li> Very easy to use ,didn&#x27;t burned me .My white areas diminished and  the look was very natural .The only thing is that the color is a little darker than i expected. I have light-medium brown hair color and wanted my beard to be dark blond.Maybe next time i put it less than 5 minutes to be less darker.The man&#x27;s beard color in the picture has nth to do with the reality</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for awhile. It&#x27;s hard to find this shade in stores and costs more as well. I&#x27;ve never had any trouble getting multiple uses as long as I&#x27;ve been careful to squeeze all air out of the tubes before putting them away for the next use.</li>
            <li> This arrived on time and in good condition.  Unfortunately despite being the lightest brown available tends to color my beard a bit too dark.  Still, it is the best that I have been able to find.</li>
            <li> First off, I&#x27;ve never been allergic to anything except ragweed in the fall.  No detergents or medicines or creams have ever bothered me.  But after a few applications of this (and I used it correctly, not overdosing or leaving it on too long) my face broke out with red blotches like boils.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would stay far away from this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d much prefer a product that took longer and didn&#x27;t tear up my face.</li>
