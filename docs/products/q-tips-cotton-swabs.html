            <li>/&gt;Anyway, at this price one should not hesitate to buy these multi-purpose cotton swabs, as they are a good value and guaranteed to give the buyer a lot of bang for one&#x27;s buck.</li>

            <li>good value for money re these cotton buds</li>
            <li>The price for these is good.</li>
            <li>If you want good Q-tips, get these.</li>
            <li>cleans your ears and good for model kits too</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t checked in the stores if I got a good valve yet.</li>
            <li>Good qtips.  </li>
            <li>With Q tips I find the durable products are perfect for removing gunk from the ears and keeping my boy fresh!</li>
            <li>I tried the store brands, but the original is the best.</li>
            <li>First of all, the best thing to do is to get used to it.</li>
            <li>I cant beleive the many purposes of Q-tips!.</li>
            <li>Q-Tips are the number 1 brand for Q-tips :)!</li>
            <li>Who doesn&#x27;t love Q Tips?!</li>
            <li>More like, O-tip!  </li>
            <li>and I am so glad I am not alone!  </li>
            <li>cotton on the ends has been greatly reduced, and can no longer comfortably remove ear wax.</li>
            <li>I will continue to buy Q-tips instead of taking chances wasting my money on the cheap sticks.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for a great product.</li>
            <li>Kind of bummed you cant by them</li>
            <li>I honestly cannot tell a difference in cotton size.</li>
            <li>Either way, I think its a nice change.</li>
            <li>, it was nice...</li>
            <li>Works great to clean your ears.</li>
            <li>they are valued at an Excellent price and large quantity makes this buy worthwhile.</li>
            <li>Great value, quick delivery</li>
            <li>Excellent quality &amp; very soft</li>
            <li>very handy for cleaning the grooves in your outer ear, Q-tips brand are the most comfortable.</li>
            <li>Great product,  fast delivery!!</li>
            <li>Of all the cotton hygiene products out there, Q-tips has got to be the most handy one of all.</li>
            <li>You are clearly the best you can buy!</li>
            <li>I tried generics, but found that the cotton tips are more compact and not as effective.</li>
            <li>Such a great price for a great product</li>
            <li>Off-brand ones bend too easily and kind of piss me off.</li>
            <li>Enjoy!   </li>
            <li>Love &#x27;em and use &#x27;em.</li>
            <li>It feels a million times better than a thousand Q-tips combined.</li>
            <li>My wife and I have used the Q-tips swabs for many years.</li>
            <li>I used to be able to &#x27;twirl&#x27; a tip counterclockwise against a terry towel to \\&quot;puff it up\\&quot; and get more absorbancy.</li>
            <li>Not any more.   </li>
            <li>/&gt;For an even better deal, buy this product through Prime Pantry.  </li>
            <li>Truly, these q-tips have to be one of the greatest wonders of the 20th century.</li>
            <li>Does anybody know of a company that makes quality Q-Tips any more?  </li>
            <li>Well, I have never followed that advice. :-)  </li>
            <li>These obviously work perfect.  </li>
            <li>The margin is for the name, but they are better than the Target brand.</li>
            <li>Q-tips, what more do you all want?</li>
            <li>QTips have always been the better quality product.  </li>
            <li>I rate these 5 stars for quality and the name brand we all love and trust.</li>
            <li>I bought 10 boxes to get a lifetime supply and got free!</li>
            <li>Qtips are okay</li>
            <li>but this comment is mostly about the packaging and the shipping.</li>
            <li>What&#x27;s more to say?</li>
            <li>I am now going to try and find a better knock-off brand.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m able to insert these into the ear canal without touching the sides at all before \\&quot;getting it in there\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have used the Q-tip brand for many years and would recommend them to anyone.</li>
            <li>If you want to save even more, look at Sam&#x27;s club for bulk pricing if  you have a membership.</li>
            <li>In fact, it looked like the glue was inferior quality, because the plastic and cardboard had separated at the top of the package.</li>
            <li>What can I say about Q-Tips that most of the world doesn&#x27;t already know.  </li>
            <li>always do the job safely and well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never inserted something in my ear that caused more pleasure.</li>
            <li>but when they are better they are better, who am I to arguq</li>
            <li>I am glad I found you guys.  </li>
            <li>I paid a bit more than in-store pricing.</li>
            <li>Softer yet stronger, there is nothing better.  </li>
            <li>These paper ones are stiffer and more sturdy, The cotton parts also attach better than they do to the plastic ones.</li>
            <li>These are 100x better :)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure you do so as well</li>
            <li>Ok, so I tried some cheapies.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a Qtip, it&#x27;s ok,</li>
            <li>anything has got to be better than these.</li>
            <li>I love the softness and fullness of the cotton swabs, and this was a pretty good value on Amazon.</li>
            <li>My ears are nice and clean.</li>
            <li>Q-Tips aren&#x27;t good for your ears, (really!)</li>
            <li>A pretty good deal with Subscribe and Save, and they get shipped to my apartment.</li>
            <li>The best tips, the softest by far and worth the money.  </li>
            <li>we went back to the original &amp; this was A great Deal!</li>
            <li>The cotton tips seem even thicker than before, and most importantly the tips held together when in use.</li>
            <li>These are very nice, a little too skinny on the top (I would prefer more cotton), but otherwise these are nice.</li>
            <li>I am sure if pressed significantly, they will bend, depends on the purpose of usage.</li>
            <li>Cleaning my child&#x27;s ear is not an easy task.  </li>
            <li>then you&#x27;ll learn that using these is easy and harmless.</li>
            <li>, they work, they do the job easily.</li>
            <li>Stands upright in my cabinet and easy to dispense.  </li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;*Sturdy, doesn&#x27;t easy bend or break&lt;</li>
            <li>The Q-tips swab has always worked just fine as they should.</li>
            <li>Quality is fine.</li>
            <li>Never go cheap on ear swabs.</li>
            <li>I bought these since they were on sale so cheap - 2 bucks -</li>
            <li>It makes a pop sound</li>
            <li>but fortunately I didn&#x27;t rupture it.</li>
            <li>They are useful in many ways.  </li>
            <li>Since these are stronger they work great on cleaning tiny items or your ears.  </li>
            <li>Since they aren&#x27;t the plastic flexible kind you really get some torque which can be helpful when you&#x27;re cleaning something from an angle.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t by the cheap cotton swabs (cough-Johnson&amp;Johnson-cough).</li>
            <li>The stick is still made of biodegradable paper, and not that cheap bendy plastic I found on competing off-brands.</li>
            <li>i cant even get my morning ear orgasm on these cheap things bend...</li>
            <li>doesnt bend as much as the cheaper kind.</li>
            <li>so got these for free.</li>
            <li>The cotton is enough for use with make-up or the like, but it is not overly filled so it wouldn&#x27;t be good for babies or job that require something more absorbent.</li>
            <li>/&gt;UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt;For those, as I, still filled with angst....</li>
            <li>These are far superior to the Q-tips with the plastic sticks.</li>
            <li>Wether you need it to clean your ears, your navel or get the makeup off (amazingly thats what its main use is), Q-tips are the way to go.</li>
            <li>They are the original.  </li>
            <li>There&#x27;s plenty of cotton at the ends to clean all those nooks and crannies.  </li>
            <li>I clean my ear canals with these.</li>
            <li>Every morning I use these to clean the water and dirt out of my ears after showering.</li>
            <li>they work they clean my ears</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re clean.  </li>
            <li>clean</li>
            <li>My ears are clean.  </li>
            <li>but I use these to clean my ears with, even though the labeling tells you not to.</li>
            <li>hmmm :) tastes great less filling!</li>
            <li>This is really true.</li>
            <li>ok, really?</li>
            <li>All I can really say is that the name brand ones are much better than the cheapo ones I saw at Walmart.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re the same as store bought, work just as well, all good, can&#x27;t complain, would buy again.</li>
            <li>You can usually get these fairly cheap (dollar tree has a nice 100 pack and the quality is nice).</li>
            <li>These aren&#x27;t those crappy q-tips that bend in your ear all quick.</li>
            <li>so we use a lot of them quickly.  </li>
            <li>The package came in pristine condition and arrived quickly.    </li>
            <li>I sought the reviews to quickly learn that it isn&#x27;t just me noticing this, ...</li>
            <li>Quick ship, no problems.</li>
            <li>My ears are so clean right now.</li>
            <li>There is NOTHING less satisfying than sticking what feels like a match head in your ear canal after a good hot shower.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t know if Q-tip reduced the quality of their cotton swabs but the new swabs work 10x better than all the rest.</li>
            <li>After experiencing many generic q-tips we found they were inferior, cotton would fall off, it would bend easily meaning they weren&#x27;t sturdy</li>
            <li>Expereinced users have been known to derive much pleasure out of these tips and even excavated so much cerumen as that it was able to determine their age by the color graduations.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>The fun of a Q-Tip is trying to figure out just what you can use it for.</li>
            <li>They are durable and soft for many uses.</li>
            <li>There is nothing remarkable about them, but they were not expensive and perform admirably the task I expected of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Be sure not to push them too far in though.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth getting the brand-name for cotton swabs.</li>
            <li>But the product is as good as expected.</li>
            <li>Strong yet flexible, consistent good quality, packaged so as to prevent waste.  </li>
            <li>While the most common and popular use consists of sticking it in one&#x27;s ears and giving the Q-tip a twirl in an attempt to clean them, one should be mindful that they are not designed to enter one&#x27;s ear canal.</li>
            <li>Some things made a long time ago r still the best Don&#x27;t mess with success!</li>
            <li>we&#x27;re right on par with what I can get them for at the drugstore.</li>
            <li>o right ear</li>
            <li>am I right?</li>
            <li>They surely are superior to the arms of your eyeglasses&#x27; frame or your trusty old Black &amp; Decker drill.</li>
            <li>I have a huge drainage issue with me ears, and these are high quality Q-tips.</li>
            <li>You just stick it in the ear and dig through, much like the special drilling machines dug their way to make the Chunnelbetween France and England.</li>
            <li>imagine all the Hollywood make-up folk... running all over the land to now find new DECENT swabs!!!!</li>
            <li>I was very pleased to see that Q-tips are still the same high quality swabs that I remember.</li>
            <li>, I just thought I was getting such a great deal (initially thinking it was 2 packs of 750).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Q-tips have been around forever and have always been the safest and most useful of the cotton swabs available to the general public.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad i find this same brand here</li>
            <li>usually buy generic ones at the Dollar Tree, for a dollar of course, and those work perfectly well and NEVER unravel on me.</li>
            <li>the name-brand is only SLIGHTLY better than the generics.  </li>
            <li>First time ever leaving feedback.</li>
            <li>This is a brand I&#x27;ve always used and the quality is consistent.</li>
            <li>I keep both bathrooms stocked by buying this quantity with even more left over.</li>
            <li>many others also have the very same observations &amp; complaints.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>That said, they are still 10 times better than any generic brand q-tip, so there is no way I&#x27;ll be switching for now.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>the are exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>First concerning the amount of cotton on the tip and now even the quality of the stick itself.</li>
            <li>Item arrived on time and exactly as described.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;m not the only one</li>
            <li>I found myself assuming the price was better than locally.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure you have seen them or a similar item before.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for.....</li>
            <li>Good Quality, not flimsy and cotton does not easily pull off.</li>
            <li>Great for a little cleanup action.</li>
            <li>Maybe I&#x27;ve missed out on these magical Q-tips in my life that some people are so passionate about.</li>
            <li>I always clean my right ear before my left</li>
            <li>purchased 3 different types (just had to try them all); &#x27;Regular&#x27; (which was similar to the current quality of Q Tips brand) for $1.00/pk, &#x27;Woodstick&#x27; for $1.00/pk (what a deal!!!), &amp; &#x27;Child Safe&#x27; (extra FAT bulb-like cotton end) for $.80/pk (Wowy Great Deal!!!).</li>
            <li>large ball &#x27;</li>
            <li>large ball &#x27;</li>
            <li>With five hundred of these little things at one&#x27;s disposal, they will last for a considerable length of time.&lt;br /&gt;These cotton swabs are ideal for a number of uses.</li>
            <li>The earwax that comes out is really just a stain on the cotton.</li>
            <li>So I sprung for a package of &#x27;real&#x27; Q-Tips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>cotton needed to make them comfortable to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recently purchased the product and noticed that the amount of cotton&lt;br /&gt;was</li>
            <li>Not trying to sound like some commercial, I continue to recommend Q-tip brand to everyone.</li>
            <li>Why go to the drugstore when you can buy the same product here and get it shipped for free?  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m literally standing here with wet hair just out of the shower, irritated that I can&#x27;t find a better cotton swab to use than QTip brand.</li>
            <li>or they have really cheapened the quality of this</li>
            <li>product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I considered returning them, but needed to know if it was just me complaining or if they really have RUINED the quality of this product.</li>
            <li>Highly Recommended!</li>
            <li>o wax came straight out &#x27;</li>
            <li>o wax came straight out &#x27;</li>
            <li>I use these for everything from art projects to removing eye makeup gently.</li>
            <li>Very unfulfilling and all to save a buck - I&#x27;ll take my earwax elsewhere...</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t beat the real thing</li>
            <li>Priced twice as much as anywhere else...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other brands &amp; nothing compared to Q-tips® Cotton Swabs ... until recently, when I purchased what I thought was a really good deal at &#x27;S&#x27; Club ...</li>
            <li>In fact , the manufacturer cautions the buyer to only gently swab around the outer surface of the ears, if the swabs are used to clean ears.&lt;br /&gt;Still,  there are many other uses.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;ve always satisfied my expectations and if anyone has ever used the other brands they would change their minds concerning these q-tips.</li>
            <li>, I decided to search &amp; try other brands for a better alternative.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It says on the package, \\&quot;more cotton than any other swab\\&quot; - but is that by microgram or something?</li>
            <li>one end has more cotton than the other side....</li>
            <li>Seems to me that there is more cotton on the ends of the swab than with other brands.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t beat the one and only original &amp;#34;Q-tips&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Barely enough cotton on the ends to look like a swab, let alone clean anything.  </li>
            <li>I used to love Q-Tips brand because they were sturdy and got the job done, now they are limp and cheap like their worst competitor, I will save my money and buy the best quality of the cheap ones.</li>
            <li>If one wants cotton swabs that are made with a hundred percent pure cotton and have more soft cotton at the tip than any other brand, then this is the cotton swab one wants.</li>
            <li>They also had &#x27;Regular Colored Wand&#x27; types in a variety of shades for $1.25/pk (I didn&#x27;t splurge on those, lol, too hard to decide on one color &amp; certainly did not need them</li>
            <li>tip.&lt;br /&gt;Eventually (4 months later) I came full circle &amp; decided to give Q-tips a try.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kind of silly that I&#x27;m reviewing Q-tips online, but this is the only kind that I will buy anymore.</li>
            <li>You have to be a real klutz to not be able to clean your ears safely with these bad boys.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a bit more flexible and less durable.</li>
            <li>The actual earwax is more like tiny crumbs.</li>
            <li>These have definitely changed into a second-rate swab, and everyone in my family noticed it in our most recent 500-pack.  </li>
            <li>As far as changing their formula, I see it better than boosting prices and furthermore what has changed is minimal..</li>
            <li>was actually 1 pack on &#x27;Top&#x27; of 750 ct. &amp; a second pack underneath of 625 ct.</li>
            <li>If you have the means, I highly suggest you pic some up.</li>
            <li>These are worth the extra money.</li>
            <li>Last for a long time as so many.</li>
            <li>It actually says so right on the box.</li>
            <li>Generous cotton swabs have been reduced by 50% or more, and Unilever is going to find out the hard way that people only bought this product because it was better than the generic.  </li>
            <li>The cotton swab tops seemed cheap like other brands I&#x27;ve always avoided &amp; the stick part seemed wimpier.</li>
            <li>It is also too little material to absorb enough nail polish remover to be effective - my sister is not happy.&lt;br</li>
            <li>There is also a new baby in the home</li>
            <li>The New Condensed Q-Tip --- just god-awful!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I agree with another reviewer....</li>
            <li>I then found all kinds of neat alternatives available at my local Big Lots store.</li>
            <li>for cleaning your dog&#x27;s or cat&#x27;s ears as well (just don&#x27;t put them in too far!)</li>
            <li>These Q-tips are exactly the same as the brand name q-tips you can buy at the store.</li>
            <li>Qtip is marginally better than target, but not better than Kroger.</li>
            <li>Wouldn&#x27;t it be funny if I left a one star review for Q-tips?</li>
            <li>Gave them one star above average since they dont hurt like some of the cheaper ones and still they remain cheaper than most.</li>
            <li>They are the high quality kind with thick middle rods and bushy ends.  </li>
            <li>The cotton may be less so just be more careful as you dig in and the stem may be weaker but I couldn&#x27;t tell much difference as it&#x27;s weakness</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t notice until I went to clear the water out of my ear</li>
            <li>I use this to clear the insides of my ears after I shower although it says explicitly not to do so.</li>
            <li>So hide these form the old Missus</li>
            <li>I, for one, am voting with my dollars, and Q-Tips brand will not see another nickel out of me unless the old standards are reinstated.</li>
            <li>is nowhere near the off-brands.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re soft.  </li>
            <li>They bend and don&#x27;t feel as soft as the Q-tip brand.  </li>
            <li>These are the Same Q-tips I&#x27;ve used my whole life.  </li>
            <li>Can hurt if you have sensitive ears</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m still alive so take from that what you will</li>
            <li>Use them to clean up spills, dab on paint, make little pugil-sticks for your GI Joe and Batman action figures.  </li>
            <li>Jammed one of these guys right in my ear hole and was pulling out mountains of greasy orange wax.  </li>
            <li>The sticks are very firm, do not bend easily.</li>
            <li>We use these Q-Tips for sanitary purposes mostly; however, they have other purposes too, such as small paint jobs, oil painting repair or even original works using Q-tips only.  </li>
            <li>Only trouble is, when your wife will ask you to take out the garbage, set the table or perform one of countless chores that wives want their husbands to do, you won&#x27;t be able to say</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Q-tips for years, the condensed cotton makes it much more easy to clean without coming apart - which I hate about other brands.</li>
            <li>if for no other reason than to get the Q-tips® company to think twice about cutting quality on this type of an item which many customers tend to stick with for decades for the simple reason that they Want/Need SAFE Cotton Swabs for their families ears, etc.. I&#x27;m certainly NOT going to pay higher name brand prices for generic or lesser quality Swabs!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The local grocery stores charge over twice as much for the same product.</li>
            <li>And more so, why keep the prices to at least double?</li>
            <li>These are simple cotton swabs that I use to clear around and in my ear after shower.</li>
            <li>The tips are soft and the sticks are flexible allowing for extra precision when you can&#x27;t quite reach for the holy of holies.</li>
            <li>Just don&#x27;t push too far deep!</li>
            <li>Completely unacceptable for what&#x27;s a ridiculously simple product...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Q-tips for over 40 years, but the last purchase surprised me.</li>
            <li>I have tried other brands in the past but nothing is better than Q-tip.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m usually a believer that generic usually does good enough.  </li>
            <li>Then, I found an old Q-Tip in my travel bag and sure enough, the new ones are like cheesy, stinky, generic</li>
            <li>I instantly noticed the so-called &amp;#34;upgrade&amp;#34; in Q-tip quality at my local CVS, so I hoped that Amazon would have some old ones for me to stock up on.</li>
            <li>A little pricey but what I want and am willing to pay.&lt;br /&gt;Double-sided cotton tips and WOOD sticks</li>
            <li>Hmmm I thought, clever packaging, but I was disappointed as I really didn&#x27;t need sooo many</li>
            <li>I really feel let down</li>
            <li>They clean those hard to get places like dried eye-drainage from our dogs and do not add too much to any landfill.  </li>
            <li>You can actually buy this straight, just ask him where you can get it without having to be part of a medical practice and sounding really odd on the phone.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My wife and I have noticed that the once large and fluffy cotton heads are now gone.</li>
            <li>even my husband, who usually notices nothing, thought I bought a cheap imitation brand.  </li>
            <li>i also use them to clean some machine parts and other very tight spots.</li>

            <li> I haven&#x27;t checked in the stores if I got a good valve yet.</li>
            <li> Good qtips.  </li>
            <li> With Q tips I find the durable products are perfect for removing gunk from the ears and keeping my boy fresh!</li>
            <li> I tried the store brands, but the original is the best.</li>
            <li> First of all, the best thing to do is to get used to it.</li>
            <li> I cant beleive the many purposes of Q-tips!.</li>
            <li> Q-Tips are the number 1 brand for Q-tips :)!</li>
            <li> Who doesn&#x27;t love Q Tips?!</li>
            <li> More like, O-tip!  </li>
            <li> and I am so glad I am not alone!  </li>
            <li> cotton on the ends has been greatly reduced, and can no longer comfortably remove ear wax.</li>
            <li> I will continue to buy Q-tips instead of taking chances wasting my money on the cheap sticks.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for a great product.</li>
            <li> Kind of bummed you cant by them</li>
            <li> I honestly cannot tell a difference in cotton size.</li>
            <li> Either way, I think its a nice change.</li>
            <li> , it was nice...</li>
            <li> Works great to clean your ears.</li>
            <li> they are valued at an Excellent price and large quantity makes this buy worthwhile.</li>
            <li> Great value, quick delivery</li>
            <li> Excellent quality &amp; very soft</li>
            <li> very handy for cleaning the grooves in your outer ear, Q-tips brand are the most comfortable.</li>
            <li> Great product,  fast delivery!!</li>
            <li> Of all the cotton hygiene products out there, Q-tips has got to be the most handy one of all.</li>
            <li> You are clearly the best you can buy!</li>
            <li> I tried generics, but found that the cotton tips are more compact and not as effective.</li>
            <li> Such a great price for a great product</li>
            <li> Off-brand ones bend too easily and kind of piss me off.</li>
            <li> Enjoy!   </li>
            <li> Love &#x27;em and use &#x27;em.</li>
            <li> It feels a million times better than a thousand Q-tips combined.</li>
            <li> My wife and I have used the Q-tips swabs for many years.</li>
            <li> I used to be able to &#x27;twirl&#x27; a tip counterclockwise against a terry towel to \\&quot;puff it up\\&quot; and get more absorbancy.</li>
            <li> Not any more.   </li>
            <li> /&gt;For an even better deal, buy this product through Prime Pantry.  </li>
            <li> Truly, these q-tips have to be one of the greatest wonders of the 20th century.</li>
            <li> Does anybody know of a company that makes quality Q-Tips any more?  </li>
            <li> Well, I have never followed that advice. :-)  </li>
            <li> These obviously work perfect.  </li>
            <li> The margin is for the name, but they are better than the Target brand.</li>
            <li> Q-tips, what more do you all want?</li>
            <li> QTips have always been the better quality product.  </li>
            <li> I rate these 5 stars for quality and the name brand we all love and trust.</li>
            <li> I bought 10 boxes to get a lifetime supply and got free!</li>
            <li> Qtips are okay</li>
            <li> but this comment is mostly about the packaging and the shipping.</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s more to say?</li>
            <li> I am now going to try and find a better knock-off brand.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m able to insert these into the ear canal without touching the sides at all before \\&quot;getting it in there\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have used the Q-tip brand for many years and would recommend them to anyone.</li>
            <li> If you want to save even more, look at Sam&#x27;s club for bulk pricing if  you have a membership.</li>
            <li> In fact, it looked like the glue was inferior quality, because the plastic and cardboard had separated at the top of the package.</li>
            <li> What can I say about Q-Tips that most of the world doesn&#x27;t already know.  </li>
            <li> always do the job safely and well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never inserted something in my ear that caused more pleasure.</li>
            <li> but when they are better they are better, who am I to arguq</li>
            <li> I am glad I found you guys.  </li>
            <li> I paid a bit more than in-store pricing.</li>
            <li> Softer yet stronger, there is nothing better.  </li>
            <li> These paper ones are stiffer and more sturdy, The cotton parts also attach better than they do to the plastic ones.</li>
            <li> These are 100x better :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure you do so as well</li>
            <li> Ok, so I tried some cheapies.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a Qtip, it&#x27;s ok,</li>
            <li> anything has got to be better than these.</li>
            <li> I love the softness and fullness of the cotton swabs, and this was a pretty good value on Amazon.</li>
            <li> My ears are nice and clean.</li>
            <li> Q-Tips aren&#x27;t good for your ears, (really!)</li>
            <li> A pretty good deal with Subscribe and Save, and they get shipped to my apartment.</li>
            <li> The best tips, the softest by far and worth the money.  </li>
            <li> we went back to the original &amp; this was A great Deal!</li>
            <li> The cotton tips seem even thicker than before, and most importantly the tips held together when in use.</li>
            <li> These are very nice, a little too skinny on the top (I would prefer more cotton), but otherwise these are nice.</li>
            <li> I am sure if pressed significantly, they will bend, depends on the purpose of usage.</li>
            <li> Cleaning my child&#x27;s ear is not an easy task.  </li>
            <li> then you&#x27;ll learn that using these is easy and harmless.</li>
            <li> , they work, they do the job easily.</li>
            <li> Stands upright in my cabinet and easy to dispense.  </li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;*Sturdy, doesn&#x27;t easy bend or break&lt;</li>
            <li> The Q-tips swab has always worked just fine as they should.</li>
            <li> Quality is fine.</li>
            <li> Never go cheap on ear swabs.</li>
            <li> I bought these since they were on sale so cheap - 2 bucks -</li>
            <li> It makes a pop sound</li>
            <li> but fortunately I didn&#x27;t rupture it.</li>
            <li> They are useful in many ways.  </li>
            <li> Since these are stronger they work great on cleaning tiny items or your ears.  </li>
            <li> Since they aren&#x27;t the plastic flexible kind you really get some torque which can be helpful when you&#x27;re cleaning something from an angle.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t by the cheap cotton swabs (cough-Johnson&amp;Johnson-cough).</li>
            <li> The stick is still made of biodegradable paper, and not that cheap bendy plastic I found on competing off-brands.</li>
            <li> i cant even get my morning ear orgasm on these cheap things bend...</li>
            <li> doesnt bend as much as the cheaper kind.</li>
            <li> so got these for free.</li>
            <li> The cotton is enough for use with make-up or the like, but it is not overly filled so it wouldn&#x27;t be good for babies or job that require something more absorbent.</li>
            <li> /&gt;UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt;For those, as I, still filled with angst....</li>
            <li> These are far superior to the Q-tips with the plastic sticks.</li>
            <li> Wether you need it to clean your ears, your navel or get the makeup off (amazingly thats what its main use is), Q-tips are the way to go.</li>
            <li> They are the original.  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s plenty of cotton at the ends to clean all those nooks and crannies.  </li>
            <li> I clean my ear canals with these.</li>
            <li> Every morning I use these to clean the water and dirt out of my ears after showering.</li>
            <li> they work they clean my ears</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re clean.  </li>
            <li> clean</li>
            <li> My ears are clean.  </li>
            <li> but I use these to clean my ears with, even though the labeling tells you not to.</li>
            <li> hmmm :) tastes great less filling!</li>
            <li> This is really true.</li>
            <li> ok, really?</li>
            <li> All I can really say is that the name brand ones are much better than the cheapo ones I saw at Walmart.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re the same as store bought, work just as well, all good, can&#x27;t complain, would buy again.</li>
            <li> You can usually get these fairly cheap (dollar tree has a nice 100 pack and the quality is nice).</li>
            <li> These aren&#x27;t those crappy q-tips that bend in your ear all quick.</li>
            <li> so we use a lot of them quickly.  </li>
            <li> The package came in pristine condition and arrived quickly.    </li>
            <li> I sought the reviews to quickly learn that it isn&#x27;t just me noticing this, ...</li>
            <li> Quick ship, no problems.</li>
            <li> My ears are so clean right now.</li>
            <li> There is NOTHING less satisfying than sticking what feels like a match head in your ear canal after a good hot shower.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t know if Q-tip reduced the quality of their cotton swabs but the new swabs work 10x better than all the rest.</li>
            <li> After experiencing many generic q-tips we found they were inferior, cotton would fall off, it would bend easily meaning they weren&#x27;t sturdy</li>
            <li> Expereinced users have been known to derive much pleasure out of these tips and even excavated so much cerumen as that it was able to determine their age by the color graduations.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> The fun of a Q-Tip is trying to figure out just what you can use it for.</li>
            <li> They are durable and soft for many uses.</li>
            <li> There is nothing remarkable about them, but they were not expensive and perform admirably the task I expected of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Be sure not to push them too far in though.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth getting the brand-name for cotton swabs.</li>
            <li> But the product is as good as expected.</li>
            <li> Strong yet flexible, consistent good quality, packaged so as to prevent waste.  </li>
            <li> While the most common and popular use consists of sticking it in one&#x27;s ears and giving the Q-tip a twirl in an attempt to clean them, one should be mindful that they are not designed to enter one&#x27;s ear canal.</li>
            <li> Some things made a long time ago r still the best Don&#x27;t mess with success!</li>
            <li> we&#x27;re right on par with what I can get them for at the drugstore.</li>
            <li> o right ear</li>
            <li> am I right?</li>
            <li> They surely are superior to the arms of your eyeglasses&#x27; frame or your trusty old Black &amp; Decker drill.</li>
            <li> I have a huge drainage issue with me ears, and these are high quality Q-tips.</li>
            <li> You just stick it in the ear and dig through, much like the special drilling machines dug their way to make the Chunnelbetween France and England.</li>
            <li> imagine all the Hollywood make-up folk... running all over the land to now find new DECENT swabs!!!!</li>
            <li> I was very pleased to see that Q-tips are still the same high quality swabs that I remember.</li>
            <li> , I just thought I was getting such a great deal (initially thinking it was 2 packs of 750).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Q-tips have been around forever and have always been the safest and most useful of the cotton swabs available to the general public.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad i find this same brand here</li>
            <li> usually buy generic ones at the Dollar Tree, for a dollar of course, and those work perfectly well and NEVER unravel on me.</li>
            <li> the name-brand is only SLIGHTLY better than the generics.  </li>
            <li> First time ever leaving feedback.</li>
            <li> This is a brand I&#x27;ve always used and the quality is consistent.</li>
            <li> I keep both bathrooms stocked by buying this quantity with even more left over.</li>
            <li> many others also have the very same observations &amp; complaints.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> That said, they are still 10 times better than any generic brand q-tip, so there is no way I&#x27;ll be switching for now.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> the are exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> First concerning the amount of cotton on the tip and now even the quality of the stick itself.</li>
            <li> Item arrived on time and exactly as described.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;m not the only one</li>
            <li> I found myself assuming the price was better than locally.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure you have seen them or a similar item before.  </li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for.....</li>
            <li> Good Quality, not flimsy and cotton does not easily pull off.</li>
            <li> Great for a little cleanup action.</li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;ve missed out on these magical Q-tips in my life that some people are so passionate about.</li>
            <li> I always clean my right ear before my left</li>
            <li> purchased 3 different types (just had to try them all); &#x27;Regular&#x27; (which was similar to the current quality of Q Tips brand) for $1.00/pk, &#x27;Woodstick&#x27; for $1.00/pk (what a deal!!!), &amp; &#x27;Child Safe&#x27; (extra FAT bulb-like cotton end) for $.80/pk (Wowy Great Deal!!!).</li>
            <li> large ball &#x27;</li>
            <li> large ball &#x27;</li>
            <li> With five hundred of these little things at one&#x27;s disposal, they will last for a considerable length of time.&lt;br /&gt;These cotton swabs are ideal for a number of uses.</li>
            <li> The earwax that comes out is really just a stain on the cotton.</li>
            <li> So I sprung for a package of &#x27;real&#x27; Q-Tips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> cotton needed to make them comfortable to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recently purchased the product and noticed that the amount of cotton&lt;br /&gt;was</li>
            <li> Not trying to sound like some commercial, I continue to recommend Q-tip brand to everyone.</li>
            <li> Why go to the drugstore when you can buy the same product here and get it shipped for free?  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m literally standing here with wet hair just out of the shower, irritated that I can&#x27;t find a better cotton swab to use than QTip brand.</li>
            <li> or they have really cheapened the quality of this</li>
            <li> product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I considered returning them, but needed to know if it was just me complaining or if they really have RUINED the quality of this product.</li>
            <li> Highly Recommended!</li>
            <li> o wax came straight out &#x27;</li>
            <li> o wax came straight out &#x27;</li>
            <li> I use these for everything from art projects to removing eye makeup gently.</li>
            <li> Very unfulfilling and all to save a buck - I&#x27;ll take my earwax elsewhere...</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t beat the real thing</li>
            <li> Priced twice as much as anywhere else...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other brands &amp; nothing compared to Q-tips® Cotton Swabs ... until recently, when I purchased what I thought was a really good deal at &#x27;S&#x27; Club ...</li>
            <li> In fact , the manufacturer cautions the buyer to only gently swab around the outer surface of the ears, if the swabs are used to clean ears.&lt;br /&gt;Still,  there are many other uses.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;ve always satisfied my expectations and if anyone has ever used the other brands they would change their minds concerning these q-tips.</li>
            <li> , I decided to search &amp; try other brands for a better alternative.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It says on the package, \\&quot;more cotton than any other swab\\&quot; - but is that by microgram or something?</li>
            <li> one end has more cotton than the other side....</li>
            <li> Seems to me that there is more cotton on the ends of the swab than with other brands.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t beat the one and only original &amp;#34;Q-tips&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Barely enough cotton on the ends to look like a swab, let alone clean anything.  </li>
            <li> I used to love Q-Tips brand because they were sturdy and got the job done, now they are limp and cheap like their worst competitor, I will save my money and buy the best quality of the cheap ones.</li>
            <li> If one wants cotton swabs that are made with a hundred percent pure cotton and have more soft cotton at the tip than any other brand, then this is the cotton swab one wants.</li>
            <li> They also had &#x27;Regular Colored Wand&#x27; types in a variety of shades for $1.25/pk (I didn&#x27;t splurge on those, lol, too hard to decide on one color &amp; certainly did not need them</li>
            <li> tip.&lt;br /&gt;Eventually (4 months later) I came full circle &amp; decided to give Q-tips a try.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kind of silly that I&#x27;m reviewing Q-tips online, but this is the only kind that I will buy anymore.</li>
            <li> You have to be a real klutz to not be able to clean your ears safely with these bad boys.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a bit more flexible and less durable.</li>
            <li> The actual earwax is more like tiny crumbs.</li>
            <li> These have definitely changed into a second-rate swab, and everyone in my family noticed it in our most recent 500-pack.  </li>
            <li> As far as changing their formula, I see it better than boosting prices and furthermore what has changed is minimal..</li>
            <li> was actually 1 pack on &#x27;Top&#x27; of 750 ct. &amp; a second pack underneath of 625 ct.</li>
            <li> If you have the means, I highly suggest you pic some up.</li>
            <li> These are worth the extra money.</li>
            <li> Last for a long time as so many.</li>
            <li> It actually says so right on the box.</li>
            <li> Generous cotton swabs have been reduced by 50% or more, and Unilever is going to find out the hard way that people only bought this product because it was better than the generic.  </li>
            <li> The cotton swab tops seemed cheap like other brands I&#x27;ve always avoided &amp; the stick part seemed wimpier.</li>
            <li> It is also too little material to absorb enough nail polish remover to be effective - my sister is not happy.&lt;br</li>
            <li> There is also a new baby in the home</li>
            <li> The New Condensed Q-Tip --- just god-awful!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I agree with another reviewer....</li>
            <li> I then found all kinds of neat alternatives available at my local Big Lots store.</li>
            <li> for cleaning your dog&#x27;s or cat&#x27;s ears as well (just don&#x27;t put them in too far!)</li>
            <li> These Q-tips are exactly the same as the brand name q-tips you can buy at the store.</li>
            <li> Qtip is marginally better than target, but not better than Kroger.</li>
            <li> Wouldn&#x27;t it be funny if I left a one star review for Q-tips?</li>
            <li> Gave them one star above average since they dont hurt like some of the cheaper ones and still they remain cheaper than most.</li>
            <li> They are the high quality kind with thick middle rods and bushy ends.  </li>
            <li> The cotton may be less so just be more careful as you dig in and the stem may be weaker but I couldn&#x27;t tell much difference as it&#x27;s weakness</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice until I went to clear the water out of my ear</li>
            <li> I use this to clear the insides of my ears after I shower although it says explicitly not to do so.</li>
            <li> So hide these form the old Missus</li>
            <li> I, for one, am voting with my dollars, and Q-Tips brand will not see another nickel out of me unless the old standards are reinstated.</li>
            <li> is nowhere near the off-brands.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re soft.  </li>
            <li> They bend and don&#x27;t feel as soft as the Q-tip brand.  </li>
            <li> These are the Same Q-tips I&#x27;ve used my whole life.  </li>
            <li> Can hurt if you have sensitive ears</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m still alive so take from that what you will</li>
            <li> Use them to clean up spills, dab on paint, make little pugil-sticks for your GI Joe and Batman action figures.  </li>
            <li> Jammed one of these guys right in my ear hole and was pulling out mountains of greasy orange wax.  </li>
            <li> The sticks are very firm, do not bend easily.</li>
            <li> We use these Q-Tips for sanitary purposes mostly; however, they have other purposes too, such as small paint jobs, oil painting repair or even original works using Q-tips only.  </li>
            <li> Only trouble is, when your wife will ask you to take out the garbage, set the table or perform one of countless chores that wives want their husbands to do, you won&#x27;t be able to say</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Q-tips for years, the condensed cotton makes it much more easy to clean without coming apart - which I hate about other brands.</li>
            <li> if for no other reason than to get the Q-tips® company to think twice about cutting quality on this type of an item which many customers tend to stick with for decades for the simple reason that they Want/Need SAFE Cotton Swabs for their families ears, etc.. I&#x27;m certainly NOT going to pay higher name brand prices for generic or lesser quality Swabs!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The local grocery stores charge over twice as much for the same product.</li>
            <li> And more so, why keep the prices to at least double?</li>
            <li> These are simple cotton swabs that I use to clear around and in my ear after shower.</li>
            <li> The tips are soft and the sticks are flexible allowing for extra precision when you can&#x27;t quite reach for the holy of holies.</li>
            <li> Just don&#x27;t push too far deep!</li>
            <li> Completely unacceptable for what&#x27;s a ridiculously simple product...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Q-tips for over 40 years, but the last purchase surprised me.</li>
            <li> I have tried other brands in the past but nothing is better than Q-tip.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m usually a believer that generic usually does good enough.  </li>
            <li> Then, I found an old Q-Tip in my travel bag and sure enough, the new ones are like cheesy, stinky, generic</li>
            <li> I instantly noticed the so-called &amp;#34;upgrade&amp;#34; in Q-tip quality at my local CVS, so I hoped that Amazon would have some old ones for me to stock up on.</li>
            <li> A little pricey but what I want and am willing to pay.&lt;br /&gt;Double-sided cotton tips and WOOD sticks</li>
            <li> Hmmm I thought, clever packaging, but I was disappointed as I really didn&#x27;t need sooo many</li>
            <li> I really feel let down</li>
            <li> They clean those hard to get places like dried eye-drainage from our dogs and do not add too much to any landfill.  </li>
            <li> You can actually buy this straight, just ask him where you can get it without having to be part of a medical practice and sounding really odd on the phone.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My wife and I have noticed that the once large and fluffy cotton heads are now gone.</li>
            <li> even my husband, who usually notices nothing, thought I bought a cheap imitation brand.  </li>
            <li> i also use them to clean some machine parts and other very tight spots.</li>
            <li> The various uses are not the main issue with these little gems.  </li>
            <li> Alas I concur with many other reviewers.  </li>
            <li> the cotton on most of tne swabs are loose and irritating when it comes loose in your ear</li>
            <li> No seriously, if you try another brand, I will hunt you down and Q-slap you!</li>
            <li> First, to soften the earwax, use baby oil or DILUTED hydrogen pyroxide in water (VERY DILUTED- ask your doc for the exact amount) then use a spritz of water from an ordinary syringe, or take a shower.&lt;br /&gt;And remember- QTIPS ROCK FOR EVERYTHING ELSE!!!!!</li>
            <li> Me, a single lonly male, does not have enough money for basic things like food, gasoline, soap, ect.</li>
            <li> (extreme caution with the tapes), and well, pretty much any hard to reach small area.</li>
            <li> If one has furniture that has carving, which is notorious for attracting dust and dirt in tight spots, dipping these handy, dandy little cotton swabs in lemon oil and then applying the soaked swab to those pesky little nooks and crannies, inherent in any carved piece, will remove that otherwise hard to reach dust, dirt, and grime.&lt;br</li>
            <li> how long it was kept opened.</li>
            <li> Fits my needs, does its job, always use Q-Tips and always will as long as the quality continues.</li>
            <li> Not as soft or fluffy.</li>
            <li> I have used every other brand, found in countless hotel rooms and even resorts.</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve pulled out several swabs that had hardly any cotton on the tip.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought three different brands each time we needed swabs over the last few months - Kroger brand, Target brand and QTips brand.</li>
            <li> Seems odd writing a review for these, so I will keep it simple.  </li>
            <li> Did you all fall off the planet for the last half decade or so?</li>
            <li> The cotton on these unravels every single time I use them!</li>
            <li> Now think of it about the size of a can of deoderant, maybe a little smaller.</li>
            <li> even my children and husband have complained non-stop with this last box of Q-tips I recently purchased.  </li>
            <li> Not available locally in the stores.  </li>
            <li> If you do that, be careful.</li>
            <li> After trying a few generic cotton swab brands, nothing holds up like Q-tip.  </li>
            <li> As expected.</li>
            <li> Not a whole lot to say about Q-Tips.  </li>
            <li> handle has changed from a sturdy paper to a flimsy plastic, probably hollow.</li>
            <li> There is not much to say about cotton swaps - they work.</li>
            <li> Spent the day with this pack...</li>
            <li> And was packaged to protect them from getting wet of damaged.</li>
            <li> They do not come apart or unravel under normal usage and this includes using this item as a small paint brush or a cleaning tool for small objects.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always spent the extra money to buy Qtips brand swabs, BUT NO MORE.</li>
            <li> Not too big, not to small.</li>
            <li> none of the other brands can quite compare...</li>
            <li> I usually do but forgot to add them in my last order.</li>
            <li> whether in my ears or when using for a craft project or other purpose.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> but how every other brand kinda disappoints.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I would use any other brand.</li>
            <li> Just be careful!</li>
            <li> I seem to always feel the sharp plastic poking through on the other versions.</li>
            <li> The other brands are too flimsy and they bend upon using even the slightest force.</li>
            <li> Their quality exceeds all of the other brands we have used over the years.</li>
            <li> I like to buy them in the larger quantities, because I have small ear openings and the moisture gets trapped inside unless I dry them out with a Q-Tip.  </li>
            <li> I unfortunately have to tell you that I am not happy with your product, I have been purchasing Q-tips for 40 years and use to love them</li>
            <li> Delicate enough on the end.</li>
            <li> Anytime I get down to about 1/10th of the box</li>
            <li> The quality seems to have gone down.</li>
            <li> I have used other brands, but they feel like you&#x27;re dragging a tree branch around your outer-ear, not smooth cotton.&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li> They have probably 1/3 to 1/2 the amount they did previously.</li>
            <li> Just your typical 500 count box of Q tips.</li>
            <li> They have changed and seem to have slightly less cotton.</li>
            <li> Q tips now have less cotton than ever on them.</li>
            <li> Plastic is a bad idea because it is bad for the environment, but that was before I was a more responsible consumer.</li>
            <li> Other cotton swabs don&#x27;t have the cotton as tightly wound and cheaper discount brands have left little strands of the stuff behind -</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, these are the new ones too.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> I use em for everything from personal hygiene to cleaning small delicate items.</li>
            <li> I will be from now on because they have so little cotton and the slippery stick</li>
            <li> Sturdy paper sticks have been replaced by flimsy little whips of paper that snap off with the slightest pressure.  </li>
            <li> They were sturdy and worked well both as &amp;#34;bones&amp;#34; and as carriers for glue to create said skeletons (little &amp;#34;shredding&amp;#34; of the cotton tip occurred during the gluing</li>
            <li> The sticks are stiff, and the cotton is wrapped tightly.</li>
            <li> I got some cheap generic swabs from the drugstore that were just awful.  </li>
            <li> These little things are the bomb dot com!  </li>
            <li> Sometime in the past year (or so) Q-Tips dramatically changed the amount of cotton on its swabs.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Whatever the change is, I don&#x27;t see these as inferior to all the ones I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
            <li> , I now find that the stick is to flexible and there is not enough cotton on the tips, that they are extremely uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t stick them in your ears, it&#x27;s not safe anymore.</li>
            <li> My mom used Q-Tip before me and I have bought them myself for 30 years and they were a non-negotiable item as far as cutting corners.</li>
            <li> Not sure why there are negative reviews.</li>
            <li> You can use these for what i already said as well as cleaning hard to reach areas in your computer, cleaning your VCR and video tapes</li>
            <li> Hard paper stick with cotton on both ends.</li>
            <li> and I ended up scratching the inside of my ear with the hard stick part.  </li>
            <li> and is NOT effective in taking out earwax.</li>
            <li> Order arrived in wet damaged box and 80 percent of the q tips were expanded and useless.</li>
            <li> use at least one a day.</li>
            <li> The common issue is that the stick they use is always flimsy paper or plastic.</li>
            <li> dispenser not particularly handy.</li>
            <li> These are not worth buying, I&#x27;m sad to say.</li>
            <li> You just end up frustrated with gross ears.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t even believe these things are so poor in quality, but yet the price is premium.</li>
            <li> Poor quality product.</li>
            <li> cant really go wrong here unless you buy the cheapos.</li>
            <li> Q-tips brand doesn&#x27;t leave fiber strands behind like the others do!</li>
            <li> Just don&#x27;t be careless when using them.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with these.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;After opening one of the packages at home &amp; using them for a couple weeks now, I was beginning to wonder if it was me, or them, but something seemed wrong.</li>
            <li> They have reduced the quality of these to the point where they are nearly useless.  </li>
            <li> , this could not be q-tips, did I get the wrong package?  </li>
            <li> What can be wrong with these Q tips</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve experimented with a couple other brands, and they were all terrible.</li>
            <li> I opened by Q-Tips today and thought I was crazy.  </li>
            <li> just called J&amp;J and expressed my disappointment and angst; my $4.09 refund is on</li>
            <li> They won&#x27;t go bad</li>
            <li> Too bad Qtips, 50+ yrs</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:mo21ZAPUM9AO3ZU]]Sorry for the watermark :(  </li>
            <li> I am somewhat disappointed with these swabs.  </li>
            <li> So disappointed.</li>
            <li> very unhappy customers.  </li>
            <li> very bad product.</li>
            <li> I tried, they failed, Q-Tips, I&#x27;M BAAAACK!!!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have any troubles with the stick bending etc, but the cotton issue is terrible!!</li>
            <li> is awful.</li>
            <li> Now I know you&#x27;re not suppose to put these in your ears but if you&#x27;re anyone who doesn&#x27;t want to be that guy with nasty ears</li>

    <ol>
            <li> They&#x27;re Q-Tips, what is there to say.</li>
            <li> I have about 25 years using this brand and not change it for another.</li>
            <li> q tips. cant really go wrong here unless you buy the cheapos.</li>
            <li> I used to get these in costco in 4/5 packs, and it took me FOREVER to finish them. I&#x27;m glad i find this same brand here and i can buy them individually with the same value.</li>
            <li> They work. Not too big, not to small. Gave them one star above average since they dont hurt like some of the cheaper ones and still they remain cheaper than most. Kind of bummed you cant by them used for cheaper...</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:mo21ZAPUM9AO3ZU]]Sorry for the watermark :(  Enjoy!   Leave reply comments on the vid! :D</li>
            <li> The 500 count tip package is what we have been looking for.  Not available locally in the stores.  Love &#x27;em and use &#x27;em.</li>
            <li> Q-Tips rock. HOWEVER,&lt;br /&gt;...people, beware! Q-Tips aren&#x27;t good for your ears, (really!) and is NOT effective in taking out earwax. It actually says so right on the box. This is really true. The Q-Tip pushes the earwax BACK into your canal, covering your eardrum, which makes you feel like your ear is clogged (which it is). The earwax that comes out is really just a stain on the cotton. The actual earwax is more like tiny crumbs. The earwax stain is caused by the smearing of the earwax on your eardrum. &lt;br /&gt;What you should do:&lt;BR&gt;First of all, the best thing to do is to get used to it. Because the way earwax works, the earwax eventually ends up within pointer-finger range (meaning, you can just scratch it out without digging). Try to get used to having it that way.&lt;br /&gt;The Doctors way: You can also visit your doctor and have the coolest feeling inside your ear. What he does is: Think of a syringe. Now think of it about the size of a can of deoderant, maybe a little smaller. He shoots water out of this, and blasts the earwax out. It feels sooooo good. It feels a million times better than a thousand Q-tips combined. Your ear is reborn. You can actually buy this straight, just ask him where you can get it without having to be part of a medical practice and sounding really odd on the phone.&lt;br /&gt;If you need to do it without a doctor: You can do this method at home. First, to soften the earwax, use baby oil or DILUTED hydrogen pyroxide in water (VERY DILUTED- ask your doc for the exact amount) then use a spritz of water from an ordinary syringe, or take a shower.&lt;br /&gt;And remember- QTIPS ROCK FOR EVERYTHING ELSE!!!!!</li>
            <li> Wether you need it to clean your ears, your navel or get the makeup off (amazingly thats what its main use is), Q-tips are the way to go. You can use these for what i already said as well as cleaning hard to reach areas in your computer, cleaning your VCR and video tapes (extreme caution with the tapes), and well, pretty much any hard to reach small area. You can usually get these fairly cheap (dollar tree has a nice 100 pack and the quality is nice). So no home should be without these so get yours today.</li>
            <li> dependable and good quality.</li>
            <li> Great value, quick delivery</li>
            <li> Cleaning my child&#x27;s ear is not an easy task.  With Q tips I find the durable products are perfect for removing gunk from the ears and keeping my boy fresh!</li>
            <li> My wife and I have used the Q-tips swabs for many years. There has never been any problem with the way that they work. They do not come apart or unravel under normal usage and this includes using this item as a small paint brush or a cleaning tool for small objects. The Q-tips swab has always worked just fine as they should.</li>
            <li> Never go cheap on ear swabs. You just end up frustrated with gross ears.</li>
            <li> PRO - its Q-Tips or it looks like a Q-Tips, product as described     CON - cannot think so any because its Q-Tips    Need it? then buy IT! wont regret it!</li>
            <li> Good &#x27;ole Q-tips. none of the other brands can quite compare...I use em for everything from personal hygiene to cleaning small delicate items.</li>
            <li> Just kidding, that&#x27;s gross.     They&#x27;re cotton swabs that you stick in your ears, what else can I say?</li>
            <li> Sometime in the past year (or so) Q-Tips dramatically changed the amount of cotton on its swabs.  They have probably 1/3 to 1/2 the amount they did previously. I used to be able to &#x27;twirl&#x27; a tip counterclockwise against a terry towel to \\&quot;puff it up\\&quot; and get more absorbancy. Not any more.   These have definitely changed into a second-rate swab, and everyone in my family noticed it in our most recent 500-pack.  Shame on Unilever!</li>
            <li> People around these parts call cotton swabs q-tips for a reason.  They&#x27;re the best.  There&#x27;s plenty of cotton at the ends to clean all those nooks and crannies.  Plus they&#x27;re great for applying make-up and cleaning keyboards, jewelry, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For an even better deal, buy this product through Prime Pantry.  I usually do but forgot to add them in my last order.</li>
            <li> I cant beleive the many purposes of Q-tips!. Me, a single lonly male, does not have enough money for basic things like food, gasoline, soap, ect. I gots to take what I can gets. So I combine hygene products like q-tips with great food like ear wax! mmmmm hmmm :) tastes great less filling!</li>
            <li> Truly, these q-tips have to be one of the greatest wonders of the 20th century. You just stick it in the ear and dig through, much like the special drilling machines dug their way to make the Chunnelbetween France and England. The tips are soft and the sticks are flexible allowing for extra precision when you can&#x27;t quite reach for the holy of holies. Expereinced users have been known to derive much pleasure out of these tips and even excavated so much cerumen as that it was able to determine their age by the color graduations. They surely are superior to the arms of your eyeglasses&#x27; frame or your trusty old Black &amp; Decker drill. Only trouble is, when your wife will ask you to take out the garbage, set the table or perform one of countless chores that wives want their husbands to do, you won&#x27;t be able to say \\&quot;What?!!!?...I can&#x27;t hear you\\&quot; anymore. So hide these form the old Missus</li>
            <li> If one wants cotton swabs that are made with a hundred percent pure cotton and have more soft cotton at the tip than any other brand, then this is the cotton swab one wants. With five hundred of these little things at one&#x27;s disposal, they will last for a considerable length of time.&lt;br /&gt;These cotton swabs are ideal for a number of uses. While the most common and popular use consists of sticking it in one&#x27;s ears and giving the Q-tip a twirl in an attempt to clean them, one should be mindful that they are not designed to enter one&#x27;s ear canal. In fact , the manufacturer cautions the buyer to only gently swab around the outer surface of the ears, if the swabs are used to clean ears.&lt;br /&gt;Still,  there are many other uses. In my household, these cotton swabs are often used for applying eye shadow, as well. I also used it when polishing furniture. If one has furniture that has carving, which is notorious for attracting dust and dirt in tight spots, dipping these handy, dandy little cotton swabs in lemon oil and then applying the soaked swab to those pesky little nooks and crannies, inherent in any carved piece, will remove that otherwise hard to reach dust, dirt, and grime.&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, at this price one should not hesitate to buy these multi-purpose cotton swabs, as they are a good value and guaranteed to give the buyer a lot of bang for one&#x27;s buck.</li>
            <li> The cotton on these unravels every single time I use them! I didn&#x27;t have any troubles with the stick bending etc, but the cotton issue is terrible!! I bought these since they were on sale so cheap - 2 bucks - but now I regret it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually buy generic ones at the Dollar Tree, for a dollar of course, and those work perfectly well and NEVER unravel on me. I figured for the price, I&#x27;d buy these QTip brand, but boy was that a mistake. I can&#x27;t even believe these things are so poor in quality, but yet the price is premium. Ripoff.</li>
            <li> These Q Tips are the bomb yo! Don&#x27;t even play around and act like you aint caring about Q Tippies fo sho. Buy these and then you will &#x3D; happy. Q Tips for life!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t get simpler than this. These are simple cotton swabs that I use to clear around and in my ear after shower. A big box like this will last one person quite a while.  A pretty good deal with Subscribe and Save, and they get shipped to my apartment. What&#x27;s not to like?</li>
            <li> Alas I concur with many other reviewers.  I got some cheap generic swabs from the drugstore that were just awful.  Barely enough cotton on the ends to look like a swab, let alone clean anything.  So I sprung for a package of &#x27;real&#x27; Q-Tips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Turns out the name-brand is only SLIGHTLY better than the generics.  Does anybody know of a company that makes quality Q-Tips any more?  These are not worth buying, I&#x27;m sad to say.</li>
            <li> Great product, as advertised, Great seller and great service.</li>
            <li> good price and does the job</li>
            <li> Speedy shipping by seller, great price &amp; a quality item!</li>
            <li> You know how they say the only thing you should stick in your ear is your elbow? Well, I have never followed that advice. :-)  I use Q-tips to get water out of my ears when I get out of the shower. Other cotton swabs don&#x27;t have the cotton as tightly wound and cheaper discount brands have left little strands of the stuff behind - whether in my ears or when using for a craft project or other purpose.&lt;br /&gt;Also very handy for cleaning the grooves in your outer ear, Q-tips brand are the most comfortable. I have used other brands, but they feel like you&#x27;re dragging a tree branch around your outer-ear, not smooth cotton.&lt;br /&gt;Good for cleaning your dog&#x27;s or cat&#x27;s ears as well (just don&#x27;t put them in too far!) - and just a good product for about a million uses. I&#x27;ve even used them to get shoe polish into hard-to-reach groves in dress shoes - and Q-tips brand doesn&#x27;t leave fiber strands behind like the others do!</li>
            <li> I clean my ear canals with these. Don&#x27;t tell anyone. If you do that, be careful. I can&#x27;t actually imagine another use for these anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Huh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do yourself a favor and buy these name-brand ones. Off-brand ones bend too easily and kind of piss me off. These don&#x27;t, so I prefer them. It&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> Seems odd writing a review for these, so I will keep it simple.  They are the original.  We use their brand name as though it is describing a type product (see: Kleenex and Band-Aids).  These obviously work perfect.  Buy them - from anywhere you see a deal.  The margin is for the name, but they are better than the Target brand.</li>
            <li> even my husband, who usually notices nothing, thought I bought a cheap imitation brand.  I will be from now on because they have so little cotton and the slippery stick is awful.</li>
            <li> Sometimes, it&#x27;s not whether this brand is so great but how every other brand kinda disappoints. Q-Tips are the number 1 brand for Q-tips :)! I have used every other brand, found in countless hotel rooms and even resorts. I love the softness and fullness of the cotton swabs, and this was a pretty good value on Amazon. It is wonderful not to have to go to Target or somewhere else with Amazon offering these types of products online. Thank you!</li>
            <li> ok, really? Q-tips, what more do you all want?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m usually a believer that generic usually does good enough.  After trying a few generic cotton swab brands, nothing holds up like Q-tip.  The cotton stays on the tip and they are softer than the rest.</li>
            <li> QTips have always been the better quality product.  If you&#x27;ve&lt;br /&gt;tried generics you know that they often bend or lack the amount&lt;br /&gt;of cotton needed to make them comfortable to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recently purchased the product and noticed that the amount of cotton&lt;br /&gt;was not the same.  This reduced the comfort ... however this is still the&lt;br /&gt;best product in this category that I could find.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend them.</li>
            <li> Simply abysmal.  Once the best on the market, these have been cheapened beyond recognition.  Sturdy paper sticks have been replaced by flimsy little whips of paper that snap off with the slightest pressure.  Generous cotton swabs have been reduced by 50% or more, and Unilever is going to find out the hard way that people only bought this product because it was better than the generic.  I, for one, am voting with my dollars, and Q-Tips brand will not see another nickel out of me unless the old standards are reinstated.</li>
            <li> Excellent quality &amp; very soft</li>
            <li> As expected. The only cotton swabs I use!</li>
            <li> First time ever leaving feedback. Order arrived in wet damaged box and 80 percent of the q tips were expanded and useless.</li>
            <li> Shipping was Quick,packaging as described. After experiencing many generic q-tips we found they were inferior, cotton would fall off, it would bend easily meaning they weren&#x27;t sturdy we went back to the original &amp; this was A great Deal!</li>
            <li> Just your typical 500 count box of Q tips. Have used these all my life and like them quite well.</li>
            <li> These aren&#x27;t those crappy q-tips that bend in your ear all quick. Great for its cost and helps get the dirt out your ear!</li>
            <li> Not a whole lot to say about Q-Tips.  All I can really say is that the name brand ones are much better than the cheapo ones I saw at Walmart.  Same quality I am used to here.</li>
            <li> These are very nice, a little too skinny on the top (I would prefer more cotton), but otherwise these are nice. They never band when I use them. I am sure if pressed significantly, they will bend, depends on the purpose of usage.</li>
            <li> Got these for $2.97 in Sept. 2011. Can&#x27;t beat that price. Watch the price and purchase when it dips! The quality is good and these do the job!</li>
            <li> Of all the cotton hygiene products out there, Q-tips has got to be the most handy one of all. Every morning I use these to clean the water and dirt out of my ears after showering. Now I know you&#x27;re not suppose to put these in your ears but if you&#x27;re anyone who doesn&#x27;t want to be that guy with nasty ears (we&#x27;ve all seen them) then you&#x27;ll learn that using these is easy and harmless. Just don&#x27;t push too far deep! Of all my ear cleaning experiences since I was a child (yes, I&#x27;ve used Q-tips since I was a wee lad), I&#x27;ve only touched my ear drum twice. It makes a pop sound but fortunately I didn&#x27;t rupture it. Just don&#x27;t be careless when using them. You have to be a real klutz to not be able to clean your ears safely with these bad boys. I rate these 5 stars for quality and the name brand we all love and trust. Don&#x27;t use anything else but trusty ole&#x27; Q-Tips™! No seriously, if you try another brand, I will hunt you down and Q-slap you!</li>
            <li> what can one say about Q tips. This is a brand I&#x27;ve always used and the quality is consistent. The price for these tips we&#x27;re right on par with what I can get them for at the drugstore. they work they clean my ears they do the job so I guess this renders them getting a 5.</li>
            <li> I simply don&#x27;t understand the lower ratings on these tips.. They&#x27;ve always satisfied my expectations and if anyone has ever used the other brands they would change their minds concerning these q-tips. Still a wonderful product. As far as changing their formula, I see it better than boosting prices and furthermore what has changed is minimal.. The cotton may be less so just be more careful as you dig in and the stem may be weaker but I couldn&#x27;t tell much difference as it&#x27;s weakness is nowhere near the off-brands. Not trying to sound like some commercial, I continue to recommend Q-tip brand to everyone.</li>
            <li> These Q-tips are exactly the same as the brand name q-tips you can buy at the store. I use them for everything - cleaning my toes, my bellybutton, scrubbing the air-vents in my cars, cleaning my nostrils, shining my shoes, and everything else except cleaning my ears because the box specifically states that they are not to be used in the ear canal! Can&#x27;t go wrong with these.  I bought 10 boxes to get a lifetime supply and got free! shipping! OMG!</li>
            <li> What can you say about Q-tips?  They are useful in many ways.  I like to buy them in the larger quantities, because I have small ear openings and the moisture gets trapped inside unless I dry them out with a Q-Tip.  There is also a new baby in the home so we use a lot of them quickly.  Always good to have them in the medicine cabinet to apply ointment to sores as well.</li>
            <li> Qtips remain the best ear cleaners for me.  When I try others, they are too flimsy or the cotton doesn&#x27;t pad my ear canal well enough and it hurts.  The multi item package arrived well packed and in a timely fashion.</li>
            <li> I use them for my ears and stuff.</li>
            <li> Such a great price for a great product I keep both bathrooms stocked by buying this quantity with even more left over.</li>
            <li> Has anyone ever reviewed Q-Tips before?    They&#x27;re soft.  They&#x27;re clean.  They have a cardboard stick in the middle you can chew on...    Use them to clean up spills, dab on paint, make little pugil-sticks for your GI Joe and Batman action figures.  The fun of a Q-Tip is trying to figure out just what you can use it for.</li>
            <li> Always the best quality in Q-tips.</li>
            <li> Every Q-tip I&#x27;ve used (about 50) except one have been frayed, some to the point of unusability. Completely unacceptable for what&#x27;s a ridiculously simple product... this isn&#x27;t rocket science.</li>
            <li> Product came taped as if it had been already opened.</li>
            <li> Bought this on amazon prime, it was a great price and saved me a trip to the store.  They are the high quality kind with thick middle rods and bushy ends.  Since these are stronger they work great on cleaning tiny items or your ears.  Since they aren&#x27;t the plastic flexible kind you really get some torque which can be helpful when you&#x27;re cleaning something from an angle.  The package came in pristine condition and arrived quickly.    Bottom line: will purchase again to save myself the trip to the store.</li>
            <li> Why go to the drugstore when you can buy the same product here and get it shipped for free?  Don&#x27;t by the cheap cotton swabs (cough-Johnson&amp;Johnson-cough). They bend and don&#x27;t feel as soft as the Q-tip brand.  There are some things to skimp on, but these aren&#x27;t one of them.</li>
            <li> I always buy my Qtips on Amazon. Why? Because of the price! The local grocery stores charge over twice as much for the same product. I have used Qtips for years so I am not worried about the quality what so ever. Anytime I get down to about 1/10th of the box I order another one and it arrives within 2-days.</li>
            <li> the headline should say it all. i think the do a great job,like the way they feel. i also use them to clean some machine parts and other very tight spots. great investment</li>
            <li> last year I read several complaints that Q-tips had reduced the quality of their traditional cotton swabs.&lt;br /&gt;When I ran out (Q-Tips), I decided to search &amp; try other brands for a better alternative.&lt;br /&gt;I bought every brand &amp; type of cotton swabs I could find.&lt;br /&gt;They ALL suck!&lt;br /&gt;Most of them break or have inadequate cotton around the tip.&lt;br /&gt;Eventually (4 months later) I came full circle &amp; decided to give Q-tips a try.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know if Q-tip reduced the quality of their cotton swabs but the new swabs work 10x better than all the rest.</li>
            <li> Qtips are okay but this comment is mostly about the packaging and the shipping. When it arrived it was opened and the Qtips were all over the box. We ordered this for a medical reason and we are thinking of throwing this away as we have no idea how long it was kept opened.</li>
            <li> These are the best q-tips you can buy.  I can&#x27;t stand the ones with the plastic sticks.  The paper sticks make all the difference.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m baffled by the recent five star reviews for QTips. Did you all fall off the planet for the last half decade or so? The manufacturer CHANGED the formula to save on production costs. Its not the same product anymore. I&#x27;m literally standing here with wet hair just out of the shower, irritated that I can&#x27;t find a better cotton swab to use than QTip brand. It says on the package, \\&quot;more cotton than any other swab\\&quot; - but is that by microgram or something? I&#x27;ve bought three different brands each time we needed swabs over the last few months - Kroger brand, Target brand and QTips brand. I honestly cannot tell a difference in cotton size. Sticks? Qtip is marginally better than target, but not better than Kroger. Bottom line: save your money and buy generic. I&#x27;m not buying into the premium packaging anymore.</li>
            <li> Wouldn&#x27;t it be funny if I left a one star review for Q-tips? Of course I&#x27;m not going to do that. Excellent product.</li>
            <li> I used to love Q-Tips brand because they were sturdy and got the job done, now they are limp and cheap like their worst competitor, I will save my money and buy the best quality of the cheap ones.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other brands &amp; nothing compared to Q-tips® Cotton Swabs ... until recently, when I purchased what I thought was a really good deal at &#x27;S&#x27; Club ... what I initially thought visually was a &#x27;twin pack&#x27;, but by the time I left the store, my 1st clue that the quality was deceptive was when I noticed the &#x27;made to look like twin pack&#x27; was actually 1 pack on &#x27;Top&#x27; of 750 ct. &amp; a second pack underneath of 625 ct. (Q-tips® Cotton Swabs 1375 ct. total). Hmmm I thought, clever packaging, but I was disappointed as I really didn&#x27;t need sooo many, I just thought I was getting such a great deal (initially thinking it was 2 packs of 750).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After opening one of the packages at home &amp; using them for a couple weeks now, I was beginning to wonder if it was me, or them, but something seemed wrong. The cotton swab tops seemed cheap like other brands I&#x27;ve always avoided &amp; the stick part seemed wimpier. I thought either I was getting too critical or they have really cheapened the quality of this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I considered returning them, but needed to know if it was just me complaining or if they really have RUINED the quality of this product. I sought the reviews to quickly learn that it isn&#x27;t just me noticing this, ... many others also have the very same observations &amp; complaints.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m returning this deceptive &#x27;twin pack&#x27; ASAP to &#x27;S. Club&#x27; ... if for no other reason than to get the Q-tips® company to think twice about cutting quality on this type of an item which many customers tend to stick with for decades for the simple reason that they Want/Need SAFE Cotton Swabs for their families ears, etc.. I&#x27;m certainly NOT going to pay higher name brand prices for generic or lesser quality Swabs!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UNsatisfied Customer&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;..................&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 10-15-2013:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I returned the &#x27;twin-pack&#x27; of Q-Tips Cotton Swabs to S.Club with no problems whatsoever. I then found all kinds of neat alternatives available at my local Big Lots store. LOL, I never knew buying Cotton Swabs could be fun.&lt;br /&gt;I purchased 3 different types (just had to try them all); &#x27;Regular&#x27; (which was similar to the current quality of Q Tips brand) for $1.00/pk, &#x27;Woodstick&#x27; for $1.00/pk (what a deal!!!), &amp; &#x27;Child Safe&#x27; (extra FAT bulb-like cotton end) for $.80/pk (Wowy Great Deal!!!). They also had &#x27;Regular Colored Wand&#x27; types in a variety of shades for $1.25/pk (I didn&#x27;t splurge on those, lol, too hard to decide on one color &amp; certainly did not need them all).&lt;br /&gt;..................</li>
            <li> I instantly noticed the so-called &amp;#34;upgrade&amp;#34; in Q-tip quality at my local CVS, so I hoped that Amazon would have some old ones for me to stock up on. Unfortunately, these are the new ones too.&lt;br /&gt;The cotton on the ends has been greatly reduced, and can no longer comfortably remove ear wax. It is also too little material to absorb enough nail polish remover to be effective - my sister is not happy.&lt;br /&gt;The handle has changed from a sturdy paper to a flimsy plastic, probably hollow. Come on Q-tips, why make a &amp;#34;luxury&amp;#34; product comparable to store brands? And more so, why keep the prices to at least double? I will be contacting Unilever, and suggest everyone else to do the same.</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s more to say? They&#x27;re the same as store bought, work just as well, all good, can&#x27;t complain, would buy again.</li>
            <li> very bad product. the cotton on most of tne swabs are loose and irritating when it comes loose in your ear</li>
            <li> Fits my needs, does its job, always use Q-Tips and always will as long as the quality continues. Good buy</li>
            <li> I tried the store brands, but the original is the best.</li>
            <li> They have reduced the quality of these to the point where they are nearly useless.  The amount of cotton has been cut.  The sticks are flimsy and bend with any pressure.  They need to return these to their prior quality level.  I am now going to try and find a better knock-off brand.</li>
            <li> Great price for bulk q tips. use at least one a day.</li>
            <li> They have changed and seem to have slightly less cotton. However it might be just simply wound tighter on the stick. Either way, I think its a nice change. When cleaning my ears, the smaller diameter helps to prevent packing wax further into your ear. I&#x27;m able to insert these into the ear canal without touching the sides at all before \\&quot;getting it in there\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whatever the change is, I don&#x27;t see these as inferior to all the ones I&#x27;ve used in the past. No complaints here.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Q-tips for over 40 years, but the last purchase surprised me. They cut back on the cotton by maybe 50%. Poor quality product. Will never buy again. Greed has taken over another company.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased to see that Q-tips are still the same high quality swabs that I remember. The stick is still made of biodegradable paper, and not that cheap bendy plastic I found on competing off-brands. The cotton tips seem even thicker than before, and most importantly the tips held together when in use. I will continue to buy Q-tips instead of taking chances wasting my money on the cheap sticks.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for a great product.</li>
            <li> The cotton stays on the swab. Not in your ear.</li>
            <li> I have used the Q-tip brand for many years and would recommend them to anyone. They are durable and soft for many uses.</li>
            <li> Im not a hugh fan of Walmart, but realized they sell for 1/2 the price. same Q-tip brand and same qty of 500. If you want to save even more, look at Sam&#x27;s club for bulk pricing if  you have a membership. Every dollar counts in my book.</li>
            <li> good value for money re these cotton buds and it would really last longer than anticipated. Will buy them again.</li>
            <li> i bought this a week ago and preformed like you would expect.  i like q tips and they help me say . . . . clean</li>
            <li> Some things made a long time ago r still the best Don&#x27;t mess with success!</li>
            <li> Great product,  fast delivery!! Highly Recommended!</li>
            <li> Reliable product. Arrived in great shape. No complaints.</li>
            <li> There is not much to say about cotton swaps - they work. You can do lots of things with them! The price for these is good.</li>
            <li> Q tips suck...i cant even get my morning ear orgasm on these cheap things bend...they are junk...one end has more cotton than the other side....hell with q tips im done...cant get my ear orgasm on....bye bye q tips!</li>
            <li> I unfortunately have to tell you that I am not happy with your product, I have been purchasing Q-tips for 40 years and use to love them, I now find that the stick is to flexible and there is not enough cotton on the tips, that they are extremely uncomfortable. even my children and husband have complained non-stop with this last box of Q-tips I recently purchased.  I do hope that you will go back making them the way you used to make them. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;A very unhappy customers.  Patti Ursulak</li>
            <li> tips have enough cotton to absorb liquids or use for blending powder/pigments.</li>
            <li> Quick ship, no problems.</li>
            <li> There is a reason I don&#x27;t go generic on cotton swabs. My ears are so clean right now.</li>
            <li> there is just no substitute for Qtip brand Qtips.  I have tried the knock offs and I always come back to these.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve been using Q-tips brand cotton swabs ever since I can remember. The sticks are stiff, and the cotton is wrapped tightly. I&#x27;ve experimented with a couple other brands, and they were all terrible. The common issue is that the stick they use is always flimsy paper or plastic. Plastic is a bad idea because it is bad for the environment, but that was before I was a more responsible consumer. Pay the premium and buy in bulk. They won&#x27;t go bad I promise.</li>
            <li> Who doesn&#x27;t love Q Tips?!</li>
            <li> They are Q tips.  What can one say. If you have the means, I highly suggest you pic some up.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what I can say about these cotton swabs. There is nothing remarkable about them, but they were not expensive and perform admirably the task I expected of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend these to anyone who needs cotton swabs.</li>
            <li> What can I say.  They are Q-tips, they work, they do the job easily.</li>
            <li> Arrived in perfect condition.</li>
            <li> premium quality cotton swabs. dispenser not particularly handy. the cotton ends hold up. substitutes are cheaper in price and quality.</li>
            <li> When I received this item, the packaging of the item (the cardboard and plastic &amp;#34;container&amp;#34; that the q-tips themselves come in, NOT the box that they were shipped in) was damaged. In fact, it looked like the glue was inferior quality, because the plastic and cardboard had separated at the top of the package. I&#x27;ll go to the store for my q-tips from now on.</li>
            <li> Works great. doesnt bend as much as the cheaper kind. Delicate enough on the end. Would recommend</li>
            <li> Good Quality, not flimsy and cotton does not easily pull off. If you want good Q-tips, get these.</li>
            <li> I will not compromise on this product .  I will never buy store brand again</li>
            <li> What can I say about Q-Tips that most of the world doesn&#x27;t already know.  I can tell you I&#x27;ve been using them for over 60 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They always do the job safely and well. the never bend or break in the ear canal.  Be sure not to push them too far in though.</li>
            <li> Q tips now have less cotton than ever on them. Don&#x27;t stick them in your ears, it&#x27;s not safe anymore.</li>
            <li> Stands upright in my cabinet and easy to dispense.  Great packaging!</li>
            <li> My ears are nice and clean.</li>
            <li> like others have said, the quality of the cardboard piece in the middle has cheapened...it&#x27;s a bit more flexible and less durable. That said, they are still 10 times better than any generic brand q-tip, so there is no way I&#x27;ll be switching for now.</li>
            <li> Came in record time Loved it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always like the QTips brand.  Seems to me that there is more cotton on the ends of the swab than with other brands.</li>
            <li> Not sure why there are negative reviews. It&#x27;s your standard Q-Tip. Quality is fine. Hard paper stick with cotton on both ends. Etc etc.. Maybe I&#x27;ve missed out on these magical Q-tips in my life that some people are so passionate about.</li>
            <li> Q-tips have been around forever and have always been the safest and most useful of the cotton swabs available to the general public.  Strong yet flexible, consistent good quality, packaged so as to prevent waste.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> I am somewhat disappointed with these swabs.  So far I&#x27;ve pulled out several swabs that had hardly any cotton on the tip.  I didn&#x27;t notice until I went to clear the water out of my ear and I ended up scratching the inside of my ear with the hard stick part.  Whenever I&#x27;ve purchased q-tips brand from the store I haven&#x27;t had this problem, so maybe it&#x27;s just the stock that Amazon is getting...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never inserted something in my ear that caused more pleasure. Q-tip? More like, O-tip!  You get me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth getting the brand-name for cotton swabs.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t beat the one and only original &amp;#34;Q-tips&amp;#34; brand cotton swab.  My girlfriend actually stooped so low as to fill our qtip box with walmarts brand and didn&#x27;t think i&#x27;d notice, however I did.  I don&#x27;t always pay for name brands but when they are better they are better, who am I to arguq</li>
            <li> Amazing package! You would think that if it feel from the space it would be perfect.</li>
            <li> These are the Same Q-tips I&#x27;ve used my whole life.  they are valued at an Excellent price and large quantity makes this buy worthwhile.</li>
            <li> I purchased these to use with my 2nd grade students to create &amp;#34;skeletons&amp;#34; as part of our lesson on the Skeletal System.  They were sturdy and worked well both as &amp;#34;bones&amp;#34; and as carriers for glue to create said skeletons (little &amp;#34;shredding&amp;#34; of the cotton tip occurred during the gluing process).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They also worked well for cleaning ears (don&#x27;t tell my doctor since they&#x27;re smaller than my elbow...).</li>
            <li> the are q-tips...the are exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t push them in too deep.</li>
            <li> I am glad I found you guys.  I opened by Q-Tips today and thought I was crazy.  I thought there was a mistake, this could not be q-tips, did I get the wrong package?  I put them from the box in a container so I dug around and found the box in case I made a mistake and I hadn&#x27;t.  Then, I found an old Q-Tip in my travel bag and sure enough, the new ones are like cheesy, stinky, generic but I paid brand name price!  My mom used Q-Tip before me and I have bought them myself for 30 years and they were a non-negotiable item as far as cutting corners. Had to have the brand!  I really feel let down and I am so glad I am not alone!  I sent a note to the company but only after reading your comments.  Don&#x27;t know if it will help.</li>
            <li> So disappointed. The quality seems to have gone down. First concerning the amount of cotton on the tip and now even the quality of the stick itself. I found an unopened box from about ten years ago in the basement. I want to keep it to one day show my grandkids what American products used to be like.</li>
            <li> Works great to clean your ears. Do not use during earthquake.</li>
            <li> Spent the day with this pack...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Swab Numero Uno) large ball &#x27;o wax came straight out &#x27;o right ear hole.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Swab Numero Dos) large ball &#x27;o wax came straight out &#x27;o left ear hole.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Revelation Uno) I always clean my right ear before my left ear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Numero Uno and Dos) The swabs have 2 sides! Great for a little cleanup action.</li>
            <li> Cotton on the end, paper rod thingy, just like you&#x27;d expect.  My ears are clean.  Ahhhh.  I think the Q in Q-Tip stands for Qlean.  But I didn&#x27;t pass 2nd grade spelling.</li>
            <li> The only brand I buy. Have been using this product for decades.</li>
            <li> What can you say about q-tips? I had two amazon gift cards and couldn&#x27;t think of anything to buy at the same so got these for free.</li>
            <li> Item arrived on time and exactly as described.  Couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li> The best tips, the softest by far and worth the money.  I use these for everything from art projects to removing eye makeup gently.</li>
            <li> cleans your ears and good for model kits too</li>
            <li> I paid a bit more than in-store pricing. But the product is as good as expected. And was packaged to protect them from getting wet of damaged.</li>
            <li> I have tried other brands in the past but nothing is better than Q-tip.  Softer yet stronger, there is nothing better.  A product with a thousand uses.  This 500 count can be found elsewhere cheaper.</li>
            <li> Never ever buy generic cotton swabs!! I tried, they failed, Q-Tips, I&#x27;M BAAAACK!!! You are clearly the best you can buy!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Q-tips for years, the condensed cotton makes it much more easy to clean without coming apart - which I hate about other brands. I don&#x27;t think I would use any other brand.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;m not the only one but I use these to clean my ears with, even though the labeling tells you not to. Just be careful!</li>
            <li> These are far superior to the Q-tips with the plastic sticks. These paper ones are stiffer and more sturdy, The cotton parts also attach better than they do to the plastic ones. I seem to always feel the sharp plastic poking through on the other versions. These paper ones just feel great.</li>
            <li> These little things are the bomb dot com!  Jammed one of these guys right in my ear hole and was pulling out mountains of greasy orange wax.  They&#x27;re also great for crafts! 10/10 would buy again!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kind of silly that I&#x27;m reviewing Q-tips online, but this is the only kind that I will buy anymore. I tried generics, but found that the cotton tips are more compact and not as effective. These are 100x better :)</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;*Easy to use&lt;br /&gt;*Plenty of cotton on each end&lt;br /&gt;*Soft&lt;br /&gt;*Sturdy, doesn&#x27;t easy bend or break&lt;br /&gt;*Lots of different uses, from cleaning, personal care, make up, etc&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;*No complaints here!</li>
            <li> The sticks are very firm, do not bend easily. The cotton is enough for use with make-up or the like, but it is not overly filled so it wouldn&#x27;t be good for babies or job that require something more absorbent.</li>
            <li> Size matters when it comes to cotton swabs. I&#x27;ve always spent the extra money to buy Qtips brand swabs, BUT NO MORE. My wife and I have noticed that the once large and fluffy cotton heads are now gone. There is NOTHING less satisfying than sticking what feels like a match head in your ear canal after a good hot shower. I&#x27;ve even tried &#x27;fluffing&#x27; up the heads, but there&#x27;s not even enough cotton on the tips anymore to do that! Very unfulfilling and all to save a buck - I&#x27;ll take my earwax elsewhere...</li>
            <li> I use this to clear the insides of my ears after I shower although it says explicitly not to do so. I&#x27;m sure you do so as well am I right? Only this brands works for me. The other brands are too flimsy and they bend upon using even the slightest force.</li>
            <li> We use these Q-Tips for sanitary purposes mostly; however, they have other purposes too, such as small paint jobs, oil painting repair or even original works using Q-tips only.  They clean those hard to get places like dried eye-drainage from our dogs and do not add too much to any landfill.  The various uses are not the main issue with these little gems.  It is the quality of them.  Their quality exceeds all of the other brands we have used over the years.</li>
            <li> Not the q-tips I remember. Not as soft or fluffy. Can hurt if you have sensitive ears</li>
            <li> Ok, so I tried some cheapies.  I wasn&#x27;t impressed.  These are worth the extra money. I won&#x27;t buy the cheaper ones again.</li>
            <li> Everybody could always use a qtip.</li>
            <li> Price was a bit out of line. I found myself assuming the price was better than locally. Wrong-o.</li>
            <li> Brand name cotton swabs. Do the job.</li>
            <li> I have a huge drainage issue with me ears, and these are high quality Q-tips. Will definitely buy again</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t beat the real thing</li>
            <li> Very happy with the price per quantity ...  Well done ...  Thank you ...</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re Q-tips.  There are 500 of them.  I&#x27;m sure you have seen them or a similar item before.  They work,  seem well made.</li>
            <li> Priced twice as much as anywhere else...</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for.....great item!!!</li>
            <li> the one and only ..  you know some thing you need to just buy name brands.. this is one of those things</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a Qtip, it&#x27;s ok, I haven&#x27;t checked in the stores if I got a good valve yet. That will determine whether I order it again.</li>
            <li> Good qtips.  Last for a long time as so many.</li>
            <li> Says not to insert into ear... I did anyway&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m still alive so take from that what you will</li>
            <li> Basic, gets the job done.</li>
            <li> The New Condensed Q-Tip --- just god-awful!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I agree with another reviewer.... shame on you Qtips!!!&lt;br /&gt;Just imagine all the Hollywood make-up folk... running all over the land to now find new DECENT swabs!!!! oh my god --- are you out of your mind Qtips?!??!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just called J&amp;J and expressed my disappointment and angst; my $4.09 refund is on it&#x27;s way. EVERYBODY else SHOULD DO the same!&lt;br /&gt;Use the ph# on the back of the box, can&#x27;t put it here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;.... with the 5 I have left ---- antiques roadshow here I come!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt;For those, as I, still filled with angst.... I&#x27;m picking up a pkg of these:&lt;br /&gt;**Royal Wood Stick Cotton Swabs 1 Box - 300 Count ($7.98+freeShip)**&lt;br /&gt;...found here on amazon. A little pricey but what I want and am willing to pay.&lt;br /&gt;Double-sided cotton tips and WOOD sticks w/decent reviews... anything has got to be better than these. Too bad Qtips, 50+ yrs, it was nice... but I have to go now.</li>
            <li> nothing to complain about, the price, the quality and the quantity. just buy it, if you need a lot of cotton swabs</li>
            <li> What can be wrong with these Q tips</li>
