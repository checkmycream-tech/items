            <li>It&#x27;s the best.</li>
            <li>It smell wonderful!</li>
            <li>However, the shampoo and conditioner work perfectly</li>
            <li>AND at a great price!</li>
            <li>I have used olive oil before and while it does wonderful shiny things to my hair, it also was a nightmare to wash out.  </li>
            <li>Absolutely love this product!!!</li>
            <li>And it smell very good.</li>
            <li>As I use with the Brilliant glossing shampoo.</li>
            <li>I use it with Fekkai Brilliant Glossing Shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Used in combination with the Fekkai Brilliant Glossing Shampoo, it treats and renourishes the hair.</li>
            <li>Loved it!</li>
            <li>Eliminates electricity, fly away, and adds an incredible sheen to my hair.</li>
            <li>Try this, you will have beautiful hair.</li>
            <li>Great conditioner coupled with the shampoo.  </li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>great conditioner and the shampoo from Fekkai is great also.  </li>
            <li>Smells great and scent stays in hair all day.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The scent of this product was also not that great.</li>
            <li>And it smelled great.  </li>
            <li>This and the shampoo makes my scalp tingle and feel great.</li>
            <li>I think this conditioner is great.</li>
            <li>The product was great</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also a great detangler for unruly hair like mine!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great shampoo, leaves hair with a great shine snd no frizziness.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m definitely happy about that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This works great.</li>
            <li>This Fekkai product leaves my hair shinny and smells amazing!</li>
            <li>I can use any generic/cheap shampoo with this product and my hair will still look healthy, shiny, and great!  </li>
            <li>I tried this conditioner and the Fekkai Prx conditioner and while both were very good, I think the Prx conditioner is a touch better for increasing softness and keeping hair manageable.  </li>
            <li>I have to use more amount of conditioner compare to the Brilliant Glossing Shampoo.</li>
            <li>This conditioner, however, is surprisingly watery.</li>
            <li>I bought this conditioner because I read on another website how good it was.</li>
            <li>Smells delicious, lathers well and leaves hair smooth.</li>
            <li>Loved it.  </li>
            <li>I really, really love the Fekkai Brilliant Glossing Shampoo and Conditioner.</li>
            <li>loved that it had olive oil in it, even if it was the 5th ingredient.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it added significant gloss or shine (like coconut oil or shine spray) but it is an awesome conditioner  </li>
            <li>I love their shampoo and conditioner great price, but now they have the hair perfume</li>
            <li>Happy to say product is fantastic!</li>
            <li>I switched to these from the Fekkai Technician Shampoo and Conditioner when I stopped highlighting my hair and was very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>I did notice that my hair was more manageable, softer, and did I mention it smelled great?</li>
            <li>-- my hair will look perfectly coiffed if I do blow dry it, but if I don&#x27;t, it still looks naturally brilliant!</li>
            <li>My hair felt incredibly moisturized right away, even during my shower while just applying it to my hair!</li>
            <li>I love this gloss!</li>
            <li>my favorite shampoo &amp; conditioner ever!</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this glossing conditioner!  </li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>Love this conditioner!  </li>
            <li>GREAT for fine hair.</li>
            <li>smells amazing and the scent lasts all day</li>
            <li>Smells nice.</li>
            <li>The scent is really nice.  </li>
            <li>I received this product from the company in exchange for an honest review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It smelled nice, but I didn&#x27;t care for anything else about the conditioner itself.</li>
            <li>First off, this smells incredible.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay, but not as great as the advanced glossing conditioner product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very easy to distribute throughout my hair</li>
            <li>Nice conditioner, but nothing outstanding.  </li>
            <li>I was really impressed, and happy to FINALLY find a product that really works!  </li>
            <li>Love this shampoo.</li>
            <li>A favorite of mine.</li>
            <li>I used to love this conditioner (it was my go to for years) and the leave in glossing cream, but they changed the formulas when they redesigned the bottles.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t even finish the bottle because I felt like my hair was getting drier and more damaged and tangly over time.</li>
            <li>My favorite conditioner.</li>
            <li>I do better with the Fekkai Color Care or Shea conditioner.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>More greasy than shiny.  </li>
            <li>: It makes your hair more moist (not quite silky for me).</li>
            <li>I like their Apple Cider scent better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve smelled better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not 100% sure about the glossing effects.  </li>
            <li>am of the school that thinks it&#x27;s OK to use cheapo shampoo,</li>
            <li>and it is healthy.</li>
            <li>This is my daughters favorite conditioner.</li>
            <li>She&#x27;ll love getting it.</li>
            <li>I love the Fekkai line.  </li>
            <li>They smell fantastic!  </li>
            <li>Received as a free sample from Influenster for testing purposes and bought immediately!  </li>
            <li>I tried it, although it is a bit pricey, but was so glad i did.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m thinking maybe they are using it along with the shampoo (which I haven&#x27;t tried) and with the glossing cream (which I LOVE)</li>
            <li>Given how much I really love the glossing cream I thought I&#x27;d give this a shot.</li>
            <li>And my hair looks great after using this (for reference, I have color-treated, basically straight, waist-length hair).</li>
            <li>, this is one of my top 2 or 3 favorites.</li>
            <li>So glad Amazon carries this product....</li>
            <li>I was expecting more for what I paid.</li>
            <li>I love this glossing conditioner.</li>
            <li>Fekkai products tend to work better when you are using the matching shampoos and conditioners.</li>
            <li>love what this conditioner does.</li>
            <li>I received this product compliments of @influenster and love it.</li>
            <li>I will continue to use this product as I love the results.</li>
            <li>good for the price, keeps my color, not too slippery, right balance of moisture.</li>
            <li>Great detangler, softener and gives high shine.  </li>
            <li>It smells nice, it rinses well, but I don&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s super conditioning</li>
            <li>If you hair is like mine, and isn&#x27;t exceptionally dry, this could be your perfect pair as well.</li>
            <li>Makes it easy to get a comb through in the shower and throughout the day as well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s too strong.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a really strong fresh-cut-grass/</li>
            <li>Really strong smell.</li>
            <li>My hair is very glossy, and I actually feel more brilliant!</li>
            <li>Fekkai products are hands down some the best.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair and this is the product I was waiting for.  </li>
            <li>But detanglers often work best on the straightest parts â€“ usually the longest hair, while leaving the curly hair mostly tangled and</li>
            <li>I honestly can&#x27;t say if it is good at glossing because after I use the duo, my hair actually volumizes a bit and gets frizzy -- like it is overly clean as if I used a clarifying shampoo and conditioner</li>
            <li>The Bed Head shampoo is very costly, but it smells amazing and the price is justified.</li>
            <li>The quality now is like any cheap drugstore off-brand.</li>
            <li>They should make it fragrance free.</li>
            <li>I received a free sample of this conditioner and shampoo from Influenster to try and review.  </li>
            <li>received this sample free for the purpose of review from Influenster and Fekkai.</li>
            <li>My hair is smooth and frizz free.  </li>
            <li>It was too light for my hair type</li>
            <li>hair feels so much softer after using and my hair also has so much more life and looks so much more shinier and healthier</li>
            <li>This would be more suitable for finer hair and for hair that is not heavily damaged.</li>
            <li>I feel like I&#x27;ve just come from the salon when I use it because I&#x27;m enveloped in the light, clean scent of it.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s as spectacular as my Fekkai glossing creme, but it does a decent job in conditioning my hair.  </li>
            <li>It left my hair feeling soft, shiny, and deliciously scented.  </li>
            <li>I think it would be great for finer hair that gets weighed down easily.</li>
            <li>The others make my hair seem smooth and worth the cost.</li>
            <li>Has a nice sort of soft lemony scent.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a bad conditioner, I just would not get it again.</li>
            <li>This conditioner was on par with a salon conditioner and left my hair soft and manageable and is really a very good conditioner.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been many, many years since I have smelled Pert, but I think that&#x27;s the same scent.</li>
            <li>I rarely write reviews, but I love this shampoo/conditioner so much, that I wanted to pass along the feedback.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very happy with this conditioner; I like it a little better than the shampoo from the same line.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure the new version is cheaper to produce</li>
            <li>I take good care of my hair, so for it to feel dry is abnormal.</li>
            <li>My hair has been worked over pretty good with highlights throughout and then, highlights ramped up a bit six weeks later.  </li>
            <li>I color my hair every month, which might have had something to do with my lack of success.</li>
            <li>It smells fresh like plants too.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Got this as a complimentary product to try in my Influenster voxbox.  </li>
            <li>I love the Fekkai hairspray, so I expected to love this Glossing Conditioner as well.</li>
            <li>#34;I received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes.&amp;#34; *</li>
            <li>I love this product, it makes your hair feel so soft and if you have color in your hair</li>
            <li>I received this product complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It has made my hair shiny and more alive looking.  </li>
            <li>I will keep this on hand to use if I just have to shower 2 days in a row, so that I don&#x27;t over-condition (my hair gets oily fast if I wash too much, but tangles super easy in the shower).</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t care for scented products and happy the light scent did not last long after I styled my hair.  </li>
            <li>I was excited because when I tried it in the shower, my hair felt very silky.</li>
            <li>Left to its own devices, it can look pretty flyaway and frizzy.  </li>
            <li>I have thick curly hair and was impressed with how soft my hair felt after using this product.  </li>
            <li>One positive is the scent, it smells fresh and light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use a flat iron very briefly after drying and my hair looks great.</li>
            <li>It feels indulgent and luxurious on, and It left my hair feeling super silky and strong.  </li>
            <li>Perhaps someone with a different hair type may benefit better than I with this conditioner.</li>
            <li>In the future, I would probably just get the Prx conditioner because I think that one is better for damaged hair.  </li>
            <li>97 cent White Rain conditioner from Wal-Mart has a better consistency.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But, it&#x27;s pretty feint compared to the overwhelming vanilla of the blue -- however, I can still smell it on my hair 2 days after using it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love it, it smells terrific and makes my hair shine-</li>
            <li>This lovely conditioner from Fekkai totally does the trick!</li>
            <li>The conditioner has a pleasant light scent and is very thick.  </li>
            <li>i found the formula to be a bit thinner than other conditioners I use, but it did effectively soften and make my hair manageable.  </li>
            <li>This conditioner is a bit more liquidy and not as thick as most.</li>
            <li>This conditioner smells so fresh and clean and left my hair feeling super soft and manageable!</li>
            <li>I bought this with high hopes of finally finding a great conditioner that would be worth the higher cost of my previous endeavors.</li>
            <li>It has the same fresh, clean smell.</li>
            <li>This conditioner makes my hair really shiny.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t really make my hair glossier.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended if you&#x27;re up for a splurge!</li>
            <li>It is *very* fragrant, and the smell stays with me even after my shower.</li>
            <li>floral scent isn&#x27;t really very floral.</li>
            <li>, I dislike this so much.</li>
            <li>but I wouldn&#x27;t spend that much again.</li>
            <li>Not so much.</li>
            <li>For reference, my hair is medium thickness and straight.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It also didn&#x27;t really condition my hair at all - my hair gets very tangled and</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>and this really helps with the manageability of the longer hair.  </li>
            <li>I purchased an advanced glossing conditioner by Fekkai last year.  </li>
            <li>As for glossing, I didn&#x27;t really see an improvement in the shine of my hair.</li>
            <li>Glossing conditioner also worked very well as a detangler.  </li>
            <li>It left my hair amazingly soft and smooth!  </li>
            <li>I had been using Wen products for a few years now, but am looking around because they do not seem as effective as they once were.  </li>
            <li>My hair is noticeably shinier and more manageable than when I use other products.  </li>
            <li>I found the Fekkai Brilliant Glossing Cream in this same line to be too heavy for my fine hair, even when I used only a tiny amount.</li>
            <li>This really was light on the hair and really helped this dry and brittle ends of my hair.</li>
            <li>And my hair is smooth and shiny after trying it a few times and I love that it is light weight and does not leave my hair oily or heavy.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve purchased Fekkai Color Conditioner in the past and was thrilled with the results.</li>
            <li>I decided to try this once on a whim since the blue one was too sickeningly sweet with the vanilla</li>
            <li>/&gt;I was really excited to get this since my think, brown hair is dull and I really want it to be shiny and smooth.</li>
            <li>Most shampoos and conditioners on the market still require me to occasionally give my hair an extra moisture boost.</li>
            <li>My hair was always poker straight and very soft and shiny</li>
            <li>Gentle detangling, vivid gloss.</li>
            <li>I color my graying roots every 4 weeks ( weep, weep) and have been using this conditioner for sometime; I wash my hair daily, I only need a small quarter size dollup, it rinses easily, leaves no residue and love the shine!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m constantly on the look out for a super moisturizing conditioner, bur rarely do I find one that actually fits the bill.</li>
            <li>but all of a sudden the right side is curly and frizzy.</li>
            <li>New:</li>
            <li>it is July, I live where I live, and this gloss does not keep my hair from frizzing.</li>
            <li>lots of hair &amp; a new product &#x3D; a learning curve.</li>
            <li>/&gt;While the shampoo from the same line is a little thick, this conditioner has the perfect consistency.</li>
            <li>: Lightweight moisture and vivid gloss.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely not my favorite, and for the price, I think there are better conditioners out there.</li>
            <li>The first night I used it, I thought I might not have used enough...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s true: this one is much, much thinner than the others I have used (the pink one for color treated hair and the blue one for moisture).</li>
            <li>I feel like the odd one out here, but I just don&#x27;t get what has everyone so excited about this.</li>
            <li>I NEED some major conditioning and usually use some variety of spray leave in conditioner, glossing cream, and spray shine to have the shiny healthy looking hair</li>
            <li>Old</li>
            <li>My hair is so shiny and soft after it</li>
            <li>I did not notice any increased glossiness in my hair after use but my hair was still soft.  </li>
            <li>This gloss has completely gotten rid of the drizzles.</li>
            <li>Back to Oribe for me, thanks.</li>
            <li>Works well as a conditioner and makes my hair really soft.</li>
            <li>I have pretty long hair</li>
            <li>Not a big deal, really.</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair</li>
            <li>Ah I was hoping that this shampoo would leave my hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>My hair is moisturized and glossy and feels soft and bouncy.  </li>
            <li>Unfortunately, paying more for a Fekkai product would not be worth it to me.</li>
            <li>Definitely throwing out my old routine and replacing it!!</li>
            <li>I prefer a thick conditioner that makes the hair feel soft and easy to brush in the shower</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure I noticed a difference in glossiness, but I would choose to use this conditioner anyway because it smells fantastic.</li>
            <li>IT&#x27;s my favorite and hard to find!  </li>
            <li>since it&#x27;s on your head for so little time and the cleaning process/chemicals is pretty much the same from the cheapo brands to the salon brands.</li>
            <li>Smells fantastic (as do all their products) and works on my terribly damaged bleach blond easily tangled fine hair.</li>
            <li>First couple of times I used, I see no difference from other Shampoo I use</li>
            <li>Love this thick, creamy conditioner!  </li>
            <li>Even my husband commented that my hair felt dry when he touched it instead of soft and silky like normal and it looks &amp;#34;off&amp;#34; to him.</li>
            <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hair is definitely shinier after use, but for the price I feel the formula is not thick enough.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t suffer much from lack of shine, so I&#x27;m not sure it is really the fault of the conditioner.</li>
            <li>I typically only use salon conditioners because I have &amp;#34;temperamental&amp;#34; hair (i.e. damaged from coloring and heat styling combined with its naturally tendency to frizz).</li>
            <li>Gets my hair soft enough, though it doesn&#x27;t look &amp;#34;brilliant&amp;#34; or glossy.</li>
            <li>If you are sensitive to smell or prefer not to walk around smelling perfumed, you may want to check out a different conditioner.</li>
            <li>I normally use Suave or Pantene but will buy this and try long term.</li>
            <li>Personally I&#x27;ll stick with my normal shampoo/conditioner but will definitely continue to use the glossing leave in cream.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kind of a weird chemical scent.</li>
            <li>What&#x27;s the use of having shiny shampoo-commercial-esque hair if it looks as limp as the model&#x27;s mane in the before shots, am I right?</li>
            <li>This one really does seem to be on par with all the other cheapo ones I have used from the drug store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>very subtle, refreshing fragrance that doesn&#x27;t over-power.  </li>
            <li>It has a light floral scent, and smells like the sort of product hairdressers use (not surprising, as it&#x27;s a professional-grade product).  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down at all, and hair feels so much healthier when I use it.</li>
            <li>The new formula has no \\&quot;natural\\&quot; ingredients that I can see (except the olive oil they both have) and the overall list is half the length of the old.</li>
            <li>But now it&#x27;s died just as frizzy as normal, and more importantly, it stinks.</li>
            <li>I have really thick, full hair that reaches the middle of my back</li>

            <li> However, the shampoo and conditioner work perfectly</li>
            <li> AND at a great price!</li>
            <li> I have used olive oil before and while it does wonderful shiny things to my hair, it also was a nightmare to wash out.  </li>
            <li> Absolutely love this product!!!</li>
            <li> And it smell very good.</li>
            <li> As I use with the Brilliant glossing shampoo.</li>
            <li> I use it with Fekkai Brilliant Glossing Shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Used in combination with the Fekkai Brilliant Glossing Shampoo, it treats and renourishes the hair.</li>
            <li> Loved it!</li>
            <li> Eliminates electricity, fly away, and adds an incredible sheen to my hair.</li>
            <li> Try this, you will have beautiful hair.</li>
            <li> Great conditioner coupled with the shampoo.  </li>
            <li> Great product.</li>
            <li> great conditioner and the shampoo from Fekkai is great also.  </li>
            <li> Smells great and scent stays in hair all day.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The scent of this product was also not that great.</li>
            <li> And it smelled great.  </li>
            <li> This and the shampoo makes my scalp tingle and feel great.</li>
            <li> I think this conditioner is great.</li>
            <li> The product was great</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also a great detangler for unruly hair like mine!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Great shampoo, leaves hair with a great shine snd no frizziness.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m definitely happy about that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This works great.</li>
            <li> This Fekkai product leaves my hair shinny and smells amazing!</li>
            <li> I can use any generic/cheap shampoo with this product and my hair will still look healthy, shiny, and great!  </li>
            <li> I tried this conditioner and the Fekkai Prx conditioner and while both were very good, I think the Prx conditioner is a touch better for increasing softness and keeping hair manageable.  </li>
            <li> I have to use more amount of conditioner compare to the Brilliant Glossing Shampoo.</li>
            <li> This conditioner, however, is surprisingly watery.</li>
            <li> I bought this conditioner because I read on another website how good it was.</li>
            <li> Smells delicious, lathers well and leaves hair smooth.</li>
            <li> Loved it.  </li>
            <li> I really, really love the Fekkai Brilliant Glossing Shampoo and Conditioner.</li>
            <li> loved that it had olive oil in it, even if it was the 5th ingredient.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it added significant gloss or shine (like coconut oil or shine spray) but it is an awesome conditioner  </li>
            <li> I love their shampoo and conditioner great price, but now they have the hair perfume</li>
            <li> Happy to say product is fantastic!</li>
            <li> I switched to these from the Fekkai Technician Shampoo and Conditioner when I stopped highlighting my hair and was very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> I did notice that my hair was more manageable, softer, and did I mention it smelled great?</li>
            <li> -- my hair will look perfectly coiffed if I do blow dry it, but if I don&#x27;t, it still looks naturally brilliant!</li>
            <li> My hair felt incredibly moisturized right away, even during my shower while just applying it to my hair!</li>
            <li> I love this gloss!</li>
            <li> my favorite shampoo &amp; conditioner ever!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this glossing conditioner!  </li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> Love this conditioner!  </li>
            <li> GREAT for fine hair.</li>
            <li> smells amazing and the scent lasts all day</li>
            <li> Smells nice.</li>
            <li> The scent is really nice.  </li>
            <li> I received this product from the company in exchange for an honest review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It smelled nice, but I didn&#x27;t care for anything else about the conditioner itself.</li>
            <li> First off, this smells incredible.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay, but not as great as the advanced glossing conditioner product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very easy to distribute throughout my hair</li>
            <li> Nice conditioner, but nothing outstanding.  </li>
            <li> I was really impressed, and happy to FINALLY find a product that really works!  </li>
            <li> Love this shampoo.</li>
            <li> A favorite of mine.</li>
            <li> I used to love this conditioner (it was my go to for years) and the leave in glossing cream, but they changed the formulas when they redesigned the bottles.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t even finish the bottle because I felt like my hair was getting drier and more damaged and tangly over time.</li>
            <li> My favorite conditioner.</li>
            <li> I do better with the Fekkai Color Care or Shea conditioner.</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> More greasy than shiny.  </li>
            <li> : It makes your hair more moist (not quite silky for me).</li>
            <li> I like their Apple Cider scent better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve smelled better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not 100% sure about the glossing effects.  </li>
            <li> am of the school that thinks it&#x27;s OK to use cheapo shampoo,</li>
            <li> and it is healthy.</li>
            <li> This is my daughters favorite conditioner.</li>
            <li> She&#x27;ll love getting it.</li>
            <li> I love the Fekkai line.  </li>
            <li> They smell fantastic!  </li>
            <li> Received as a free sample from Influenster for testing purposes and bought immediately!  </li>
            <li> I tried it, although it is a bit pricey, but was so glad i did.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m thinking maybe they are using it along with the shampoo (which I haven&#x27;t tried) and with the glossing cream (which I LOVE)</li>
            <li> Given how much I really love the glossing cream I thought I&#x27;d give this a shot.</li>
            <li> And my hair looks great after using this (for reference, I have color-treated, basically straight, waist-length hair).</li>
            <li> , this is one of my top 2 or 3 favorites.</li>
            <li> So glad Amazon carries this product....</li>
            <li> I was expecting more for what I paid.</li>
            <li> I love this glossing conditioner.</li>
            <li> Fekkai products tend to work better when you are using the matching shampoos and conditioners.</li>
            <li> love what this conditioner does.</li>
            <li> I received this product compliments of @influenster and love it.</li>
            <li> I will continue to use this product as I love the results.</li>
            <li> good for the price, keeps my color, not too slippery, right balance of moisture.</li>
            <li> Great detangler, softener and gives high shine.  </li>
            <li> It smells nice, it rinses well, but I don&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s super conditioning</li>
            <li> If you hair is like mine, and isn&#x27;t exceptionally dry, this could be your perfect pair as well.</li>
            <li> Makes it easy to get a comb through in the shower and throughout the day as well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too strong.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a really strong fresh-cut-grass/</li>
            <li> Really strong smell.</li>
            <li> My hair is very glossy, and I actually feel more brilliant!</li>
            <li> Fekkai products are hands down some the best.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair and this is the product I was waiting for.  </li>
            <li> But detanglers often work best on the straightest parts â€“ usually the longest hair, while leaving the curly hair mostly tangled and</li>
            <li> I honestly can&#x27;t say if it is good at glossing because after I use the duo, my hair actually volumizes a bit and gets frizzy -- like it is overly clean as if I used a clarifying shampoo and conditioner</li>
            <li> The Bed Head shampoo is very costly, but it smells amazing and the price is justified.</li>
            <li> The quality now is like any cheap drugstore off-brand.</li>
            <li> They should make it fragrance free.</li>
            <li> I received a free sample of this conditioner and shampoo from Influenster to try and review.  </li>
            <li> received this sample free for the purpose of review from Influenster and Fekkai.</li>
            <li> My hair is smooth and frizz free.  </li>
            <li> It was too light for my hair type</li>
            <li> hair feels so much softer after using and my hair also has so much more life and looks so much more shinier and healthier</li>
            <li> This would be more suitable for finer hair and for hair that is not heavily damaged.</li>
            <li> I feel like I&#x27;ve just come from the salon when I use it because I&#x27;m enveloped in the light, clean scent of it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s as spectacular as my Fekkai glossing creme, but it does a decent job in conditioning my hair.  </li>
            <li> It left my hair feeling soft, shiny, and deliciously scented.  </li>
            <li> I think it would be great for finer hair that gets weighed down easily.</li>
            <li> The others make my hair seem smooth and worth the cost.</li>
            <li> Has a nice sort of soft lemony scent.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a bad conditioner, I just would not get it again.</li>
            <li> This conditioner was on par with a salon conditioner and left my hair soft and manageable and is really a very good conditioner.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been many, many years since I have smelled Pert, but I think that&#x27;s the same scent.</li>
            <li> I rarely write reviews, but I love this shampoo/conditioner so much, that I wanted to pass along the feedback.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with this conditioner; I like it a little better than the shampoo from the same line.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure the new version is cheaper to produce</li>
            <li> I take good care of my hair, so for it to feel dry is abnormal.</li>
            <li> My hair has been worked over pretty good with highlights throughout and then, highlights ramped up a bit six weeks later.  </li>
            <li> I color my hair every month, which might have had something to do with my lack of success.</li>
            <li> It smells fresh like plants too.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Got this as a complimentary product to try in my Influenster voxbox.  </li>
            <li> I love the Fekkai hairspray, so I expected to love this Glossing Conditioner as well.</li>
            <li> #34;I received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes.&amp;#34; *</li>
            <li> I love this product, it makes your hair feel so soft and if you have color in your hair</li>
            <li> I received this product complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It has made my hair shiny and more alive looking.  </li>
            <li> I will keep this on hand to use if I just have to shower 2 days in a row, so that I don&#x27;t over-condition (my hair gets oily fast if I wash too much, but tangles super easy in the shower).</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care for scented products and happy the light scent did not last long after I styled my hair.  </li>
            <li> I was excited because when I tried it in the shower, my hair felt very silky.</li>
            <li> Left to its own devices, it can look pretty flyaway and frizzy.  </li>
            <li> I have thick curly hair and was impressed with how soft my hair felt after using this product.  </li>
            <li> One positive is the scent, it smells fresh and light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use a flat iron very briefly after drying and my hair looks great.</li>
            <li> It feels indulgent and luxurious on, and It left my hair feeling super silky and strong.  </li>
            <li> Perhaps someone with a different hair type may benefit better than I with this conditioner.</li>
            <li> In the future, I would probably just get the Prx conditioner because I think that one is better for damaged hair.  </li>
            <li> 97 cent White Rain conditioner from Wal-Mart has a better consistency.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But, it&#x27;s pretty feint compared to the overwhelming vanilla of the blue -- however, I can still smell it on my hair 2 days after using it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love it, it smells terrific and makes my hair shine-</li>
            <li> This lovely conditioner from Fekkai totally does the trick!</li>
            <li> The conditioner has a pleasant light scent and is very thick.  </li>
            <li> i found the formula to be a bit thinner than other conditioners I use, but it did effectively soften and make my hair manageable.  </li>
            <li> This conditioner is a bit more liquidy and not as thick as most.</li>
            <li> This conditioner smells so fresh and clean and left my hair feeling super soft and manageable!</li>
            <li> I bought this with high hopes of finally finding a great conditioner that would be worth the higher cost of my previous endeavors.</li>
            <li> It has the same fresh, clean smell.</li>
            <li> This conditioner makes my hair really shiny.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t really make my hair glossier.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended if you&#x27;re up for a splurge!</li>
            <li> It is *very* fragrant, and the smell stays with me even after my shower.</li>
            <li> floral scent isn&#x27;t really very floral.</li>
            <li> , I dislike this so much.</li>
            <li> but I wouldn&#x27;t spend that much again.</li>
            <li> Not so much.</li>
            <li> For reference, my hair is medium thickness and straight.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It also didn&#x27;t really condition my hair at all - my hair gets very tangled and</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> and this really helps with the manageability of the longer hair.  </li>
            <li> I purchased an advanced glossing conditioner by Fekkai last year.  </li>
            <li> As for glossing, I didn&#x27;t really see an improvement in the shine of my hair.</li>
            <li> Glossing conditioner also worked very well as a detangler.  </li>
            <li> It left my hair amazingly soft and smooth!  </li>
            <li> I had been using Wen products for a few years now, but am looking around because they do not seem as effective as they once were.  </li>
            <li> My hair is noticeably shinier and more manageable than when I use other products.  </li>
            <li> I found the Fekkai Brilliant Glossing Cream in this same line to be too heavy for my fine hair, even when I used only a tiny amount.</li>
            <li> This really was light on the hair and really helped this dry and brittle ends of my hair.</li>
            <li> And my hair is smooth and shiny after trying it a few times and I love that it is light weight and does not leave my hair oily or heavy.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased Fekkai Color Conditioner in the past and was thrilled with the results.</li>
            <li> I decided to try this once on a whim since the blue one was too sickeningly sweet with the vanilla</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was really excited to get this since my think, brown hair is dull and I really want it to be shiny and smooth.</li>
            <li> Most shampoos and conditioners on the market still require me to occasionally give my hair an extra moisture boost.</li>
            <li> My hair was always poker straight and very soft and shiny</li>
            <li> Gentle detangling, vivid gloss.</li>
            <li> I color my graying roots every 4 weeks ( weep, weep) and have been using this conditioner for sometime; I wash my hair daily, I only need a small quarter size dollup, it rinses easily, leaves no residue and love the shine!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m constantly on the look out for a super moisturizing conditioner, bur rarely do I find one that actually fits the bill.</li>
            <li> but all of a sudden the right side is curly and frizzy.</li>
            <li> New:</li>
            <li> it is July, I live where I live, and this gloss does not keep my hair from frizzing.</li>
            <li> lots of hair &amp; a new product &#x3D; a learning curve.</li>
            <li> /&gt;While the shampoo from the same line is a little thick, this conditioner has the perfect consistency.</li>
            <li> : Lightweight moisture and vivid gloss.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely not my favorite, and for the price, I think there are better conditioners out there.</li>
            <li> The first night I used it, I thought I might not have used enough...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s true: this one is much, much thinner than the others I have used (the pink one for color treated hair and the blue one for moisture).</li>
            <li> I feel like the odd one out here, but I just don&#x27;t get what has everyone so excited about this.</li>
            <li> I NEED some major conditioning and usually use some variety of spray leave in conditioner, glossing cream, and spray shine to have the shiny healthy looking hair</li>
            <li> Old</li>
            <li> My hair is so shiny and soft after it</li>
            <li> I did not notice any increased glossiness in my hair after use but my hair was still soft.  </li>
            <li> This gloss has completely gotten rid of the drizzles.</li>
            <li> Back to Oribe for me, thanks.</li>
            <li> Works well as a conditioner and makes my hair really soft.</li>
            <li> I have pretty long hair</li>
            <li> Not a big deal, really.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair</li>
            <li> Ah I was hoping that this shampoo would leave my hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> My hair is moisturized and glossy and feels soft and bouncy.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, paying more for a Fekkai product would not be worth it to me.</li>
            <li> Definitely throwing out my old routine and replacing it!!</li>
            <li> I prefer a thick conditioner that makes the hair feel soft and easy to brush in the shower</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure I noticed a difference in glossiness, but I would choose to use this conditioner anyway because it smells fantastic.</li>
            <li> IT&#x27;s my favorite and hard to find!  </li>
            <li> since it&#x27;s on your head for so little time and the cleaning process/chemicals is pretty much the same from the cheapo brands to the salon brands.</li>
            <li> Smells fantastic (as do all their products) and works on my terribly damaged bleach blond easily tangled fine hair.</li>
            <li> First couple of times I used, I see no difference from other Shampoo I use</li>
            <li> Love this thick, creamy conditioner!  </li>
            <li> Even my husband commented that my hair felt dry when he touched it instead of soft and silky like normal and it looks &amp;#34;off&amp;#34; to him.</li>
            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hair is definitely shinier after use, but for the price I feel the formula is not thick enough.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t suffer much from lack of shine, so I&#x27;m not sure it is really the fault of the conditioner.</li>
            <li> I typically only use salon conditioners because I have &amp;#34;temperamental&amp;#34; hair (i.e. damaged from coloring and heat styling combined with its naturally tendency to frizz).</li>
            <li> Gets my hair soft enough, though it doesn&#x27;t look &amp;#34;brilliant&amp;#34; or glossy.</li>
            <li> If you are sensitive to smell or prefer not to walk around smelling perfumed, you may want to check out a different conditioner.</li>
            <li> I normally use Suave or Pantene but will buy this and try long term.</li>
            <li> Personally I&#x27;ll stick with my normal shampoo/conditioner but will definitely continue to use the glossing leave in cream.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kind of a weird chemical scent.</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s the use of having shiny shampoo-commercial-esque hair if it looks as limp as the model&#x27;s mane in the before shots, am I right?</li>
            <li> This one really does seem to be on par with all the other cheapo ones I have used from the drug store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> very subtle, refreshing fragrance that doesn&#x27;t over-power.  </li>
            <li> It has a light floral scent, and smells like the sort of product hairdressers use (not surprising, as it&#x27;s a professional-grade product).  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down at all, and hair feels so much healthier when I use it.</li>
            <li> The new formula has no \\&quot;natural\\&quot; ingredients that I can see (except the olive oil they both have) and the overall list is half the length of the old.</li>
            <li> But now it&#x27;s died just as frizzy as normal, and more importantly, it stinks.</li>
            <li> I have really thick, full hair that reaches the middle of my back</li>
            <li> One caveat, I discovered that in the winter when my hair is a little bit drier than normal, I needed a once a week deep conditioning treatment for an extra boost.</li>
            <li> I still had some of the previous formula when I bought the new stuff</li>
            <li> The new formula is thin and watery and you need a ton of it to saturate your hair and it doesn&#x27;t condition very well.</li>
            <li> It left my hair dry and feeling like I had just shampooed and forgotten to condition entirely.</li>
            <li> my usual conditioner (Garnied Fructis hydration) really improves this, while the glossing conditioner did not.</li>
            <li> It was not heavy and weigh my hair down.  </li>
            <li> I usually get better results with Tigi Dumb Blonde shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> just wouldn&#x27;t recommend this because of the thinness, which is one of he major appeals of the other ones I have tried.</li>
            <li> I thought that the fragrance was very strong and unpleasant.  </li>
            <li> My hair is about half curly and half straight, although that is probably caused by the heaviness of it.  </li>
            <li> Not soft nor shine like advertise.</li>
            <li> can not review as a long time user.  </li>
            <li> My sister&#x27;s very dark, very thick hair looked extremely shiny and healthy after using Fekkai conditioner.</li>
            <li> The texture is not super thick, but is not watery either, it&#x27;s just right.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even have to blow dry my hair with this conditioner</li>
            <li> I did not notice any better shine than my other conditioners either which was a disappointment as well.  </li>
            <li> This is an &amp;#34;okay&amp;#34; conditioner for my hair type but not worth the extra cost.</li>
            <li> I can get similar products for less money</li>
            <li> If you are curious and want to try this brand, I have tried and would recommend the pink and blue ones, but don&#x27;t judge this brand on this green one (which I would not recommend it at all).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> went ahead and got the pink one again</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t heavy enough, so I have to mix with other conditioner</li>
            <li> This is the only conditioner I can use to tame my beast.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m completely obsessed with this conditioner and will certainly be continuing to use it for a long time to come!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> like it a lot for cleanliness, but I wish I could get a bit of gloss without needing to flat iron and follow up with antifrizz product everyday.</li>
            <li> (though I did use my normal leave in spray conditioner before drying my hair) and I have to say I&#x27;m not very impressed.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find this product in stores, so Amazon has become my go to for Fekkai, I&#x27;ve tried several other shampoos and conditioners, but I always return to this brand.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of blonde, curly, hard to manage, on-the-fine-side hair.</li>
            <li> Definitely not worth the 20 or so bucks it costs at the stores.</li>
            <li> I have frizzy colored hair and this wasn&#x27;t thick enough for me.</li>
            <li> My hair is frizzy, very curly, and hard to manage, and after one wash in the glossing shampoo/conditioner, it was the shiniest and least frizzy that I have ever seen it!  </li>
            <li> Leaves my hair silky without feeling weighed down.</li>
            <li> And I found down that I would like to use the Apple cider with this conditioner.</li>
            <li> : It weighs hair down.</li>
            <li> It seems like this conditioner was watered down.</li>
            <li> Lots of shampoos and conditioners promise to make your hair shinier but do so at the cost of weighing it down as well.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave any residue and it doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it was only enough to sample for 2 days so</li>
            <li> This conditioner was really not good, it was either expired or a different product was bottled in the Fekkai bottle.&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend anyone to buy it.</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally very dry and dull</li>
            <li> all the conditioners I&#x27;ve tried this year (quite a few)</li>
            <li> My hair feels moisturized and it&#x27;s definitely less frizzy than usual.  </li>
            <li> It seems to work for other types of hair, but not my really thick hair.</li>
            <li> dried &amp; straight ironed sad tired ol&#x27; hair.</li>
            <li> I have thick, slightly wavy hair, and this product is a godsend.  </li>
            <li> If your hair tends to become big and difficult to tame, this conditioner will weigh it down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My hair, which is finer and blonder, was rather limp and dull after using this.</li>
            <li> However, having thin strands, thick quantity, and very long hair, I have found the quality matters for conditioner.</li>
            <li> My husband complains that it is too hard to tell which is the shampoo and which is the conditioner.  </li>
            <li> Extremely unpleasant to me, even though apparently a lot of people like it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I am not thrilled with the smell either.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This does contain at least one paraben and some dyes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got curly thick hair and would&#x27;ve preferred a thicker conditioner</li>
            <li> It is very difficult to get the oil in evenly and then to wash out enough of it while leaving the amount that kept it shiny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it&#x27;s too greasy/oily and it leaves my hair feeling heavy.</li>
            <li> To my disappointment, my usual conditioner (Garnier&#x27;s Length and Strength conditioner) out performed this conditioner by a landslide.</li>
            <li> This &amp;#34;glossing&amp;#34; conditioner unfortunately did not work for me like it did for my sister.</li>
            <li> And perhaps it&#x27;s unfair for me to judge its qualities during a humid Philadelphia July, but...</li>
            <li> it is rather expensive.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of hair, so maybe that has something to do with it, but now the smell of perfume is suffocating me.</li>
            <li> Disappointing.</li>
            <li> This literally stinks.</li>
            <li> A weird scent!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Love this shampoo. GREAT for fine hair. Doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down at all, and hair feels so much healthier when I use it.</li>
            <li> A favorite of mine. This was a reorder.</li>
            <li> I used to love this conditioner (it was my go to for years) and the leave in glossing cream, but they changed the formulas when they redesigned the bottles. I still had some of the previous formula when I bought the new stuff so I compared bottles. The ingredients are quite different and the actual description of the product is different. Old: Lightweight moisture and vivid gloss. New: Gentle detangling, vivid gloss. The new formula is thin and watery and you need a ton of it to saturate your hair and it doesn&#x27;t condition very well. The quality now is like any cheap drugstore off-brand. Definitely not worth the 20 or so bucks it costs at the stores. It used to have grape seed extract, sunflower seed extract, almond and jojoba proteins, etc. The new formula has no \\&quot;natural\\&quot; ingredients that I can see (except the olive oil they both have) and the overall list is half the length of the old. I&#x27;m sure the new version is cheaper to produce but they still charge the same price. I didn&#x27;t even finish the bottle because I felt like my hair was getting drier and more damaged and tangly over time. The glossing cream is different as well but it&#x27;s still useable.</li>
            <li> My favorite conditioner. Smells wonderful. My hair is so shiny and soft after it</li>
            <li> i am not noticing any extra shine with this conditioner.</li>
            <li> Great conditioner coupled with the shampoo.  I have fine hair and this is the product I was waiting for.  Eliminates electricity, fly away, and adds an incredible sheen to my hair.</li>
            <li> Great product. I have been using it for years.</li>
            <li> smells amazing and the scent lasts all day</li>
            <li> Only conditioner for find colored hair</li>
            <li> I have frizzy colored hair and this wasn&#x27;t thick enough for me. I think it would be great for finer hair that gets weighed down easily. I do better with the Fekkai Color Care or Shea conditioner.</li>
            <li> Fekkai products are hands down some the best. Leaves my hair silky without feeling weighed down.</li>
            <li> I bought this with high hopes of finally finding a great conditioner that would be worth the higher cost of my previous endeavors. To my disappointment, my usual conditioner (Garnier&#x27;s Length and Strength conditioner) out performed this conditioner by a landslide. I have a lot of blonde, curly, hard to manage, on-the-fine-side hair. Perhaps someone with a different hair type may benefit better than I with this conditioner. I did not notice any better shine than my other conditioners either which was a disappointment as well.  This is an &amp;#34;okay&amp;#34; conditioner for my hair type but not worth the extra cost.</li>
            <li> Both the glossing shampoo and conditioner, when used together, gives the best results I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li> I love their shampoo and conditioner great price, but now they have the hair perfume just yummy.  Bought 3 sets as gifts Thank you</li>
            <li> Disappointing. Left hair lank.</li>
            <li> This conditioner makes my hair really shiny. It isn&#x27;t heavy enough, so I have to mix with other conditioner but it definitely bumps up the shine.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this conditioner and I have to admit that I can actually notice a difference after she uses it.</li>
            <li> I bought this with it&#x27;s shampoo and also the apple cider shampoo. And I found down that I would like to use the Apple cider with this conditioner. As I use with the Brilliant glossing shampoo. My hair was just so so. Not soft nor shine like advertise. And it smell very good. I love it</li>
            <li> Great detangler, softener and gives high shine.  It&#x27;s hard to find this product in stores, so Amazon has become my go to for Fekkai, I&#x27;ve tried several other shampoos and conditioners, but I always return to this brand.</li>
            <li> great conditioner and the shampoo from Fekkai is great also.  Any of their products are a 10.</li>
            <li> I have thick, slightly wavy hair, and this product is a godsend.  I can use any generic/cheap shampoo with this product and my hair will still look healthy, shiny, and great!  I don&#x27;t even have to blow dry my hair with this conditioner -- my hair will look perfectly coiffed if I do blow dry it, but if I don&#x27;t, it still looks naturally brilliant!</li>
            <li> I color my graying roots every 4 weeks ( weep, weep) and have been using this conditioner for sometime; I wash my hair daily, I only need a small quarter size dollup, it rinses easily, leaves no residue and love the shine!</li>
            <li> No what I&#x27;d expect for the price</li>
            <li> Too glossy!  More greasy than shiny.  Seems to build up on my hair and requires shampooing sooner than I&#x27;d like.</li>
            <li> Wnderful, does not leave hair greasy but yet shiny.  Smells great and scent stays in hair all day.</li>
            <li> First couple of times I used, I see no difference from other Shampoo I use (Pantene Daily Moisture Renewal Nourishing Conditioner), but my hair started to feel heavier as I continue using it. I use it with Fekkai Brilliant Glossing Shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good: It makes your hair more moist (not quite silky for me). If your hair tends to become big and difficult to tame, this conditioner will weigh it down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bad: It weighs hair down. If you want volume, this conditioner is not for you. I also don&#x27;t like the scent. It&#x27;s too strong. I like their Apple Cider scent better. It doesn&#x27;t really make my hair glossier. I have to use more amount of conditioner compare to the Brilliant Glossing Shampoo.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s as spectacular as my Fekkai glossing creme, but it does a decent job in conditioning my hair.  It&#x27;s definitely not my favorite, and for the price, I think there are better conditioners out there.</li>
            <li> I confess to being a bit of a conditioner snob.  I typically only use salon conditioners because I have &amp;#34;temperamental&amp;#34; hair (i.e. damaged from coloring and heat styling combined with its naturally tendency to frizz). I tried this conditioner and the Fekkai Prx conditioner and while both were very good, I think the Prx conditioner is a touch better for increasing softness and keeping hair manageable.  This conditioner was on par with a salon conditioner and left my hair soft and manageable and is really a very good conditioner.  The conditioner has a pleasant light scent and is very thick.  I did not notice any increased glossiness in my hair after use but my hair was still soft.  In the future, I would probably just get the Prx conditioner because I think that one is better for damaged hair.  This would be more suitable for finer hair and for hair that is not heavily damaged.</li>
            <li> Adds shine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife is very happy with this product.  Does as advertised.  Restored shine to hair that has been dulled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good product.  Smells nice.</li>
            <li> This &amp;#34;glossing&amp;#34; conditioner unfortunately did not work for me like it did for my sister. My sister&#x27;s very dark, very thick hair looked extremely shiny and healthy after using Fekkai conditioner. My hair, which is finer and blonder, was rather limp and dull after using this. I color my hair every month, which might have had something to do with my lack of success. I usually get better results with Tigi Dumb Blonde shampoo and conditioner. The Bed Head shampoo is very costly, but it smells amazing and the price is justified. Unfortunately, paying more for a Fekkai product would not be worth it to me. I&#x27;m letting my sister finish the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent of this product was also not that great. I&#x27;ve smelled better.</li>
            <li> I love this gloss! My hair was always poker straight and very soft and shiny but all of a sudden the right side is curly and frizzy. This gloss has completely gotten rid of the drizzles. I use a flat iron very briefly after drying and my hair looks great. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This conditioner smells wonderful!  It has a light floral scent, and smells like the sort of product hairdressers use (not surprising, as it&#x27;s a professional-grade product).  i found the formula to be a bit thinner than other conditioners I use, but it did effectively soften and make my hair manageable.  I&#x27;m not 100% sure about the glossing effects.  I&#x27;m not sure I noticed a difference in glossiness, but I would choose to use this conditioner anyway because it smells fantastic.</li>
            <li> Love this thick, creamy conditioner!  It feels indulgent and luxurious on, and It left my hair feeling super silky and strong.  And it smelled great.  I don&#x27;t think it added significant gloss or shine (like coconut oil or shine spray) but it is an awesome conditioner  Highly recommended if you&#x27;re up for a splurge!</li>
            <li> This and the shampoo makes my scalp tingle and feel great. It smells fresh like plants too.&lt;br /&gt;It is on the pricey end, but if hair care is your thing, then try this out.</li>
            <li> This Glossing Conditioner smells divine. And perhaps it&#x27;s unfair for me to judge its qualities during a humid Philadelphia July, but...it is July, I live where I live, and this gloss does not keep my hair from frizzing. I am unsure if frizzy hair can not be glossy, but mine isn&#x27;t.  This conditioner did get my hair sleek until I went outside...</li>
            <li> Gets my hair soft enough, though it doesn&#x27;t look &amp;#34;brilliant&amp;#34; or glossy. It is *very* fragrant, and the smell stays with me even after my shower. It is a bit pungent but it grew on me. If you are sensitive to smell or prefer not to walk around smelling perfumed, you may want to check out a different conditioner. Rinses off well for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased Fekkai Color Conditioner in the past and was thrilled with the results.This conditioner, however, is surprisingly watery. This Glossing conditioner runs all over when you dispense it. It takes a TON of it to get through medium length hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not thrilled with the smell either. It&#x27;s a really strong fresh-cut-grass/grandma&#x27;s-gardenia-candle smell. But I see some people do like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hair is definitely shinier after use, but for the price I feel the formula is not thick enough. 97 cent White Rain conditioner from Wal-Mart has a better consistency.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will not purchase again. Back to Oribe for me, thanks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a fan of this conditioner brand, but not this formulation. It&#x27;s true: this one is much, much thinner than the others I have used (the pink one for color treated hair and the blue one for moisture). I decided to try this once on a whim since the blue one was too sickeningly sweet with the vanilla scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The floral scent isn&#x27;t really very floral. It&#x27;s kind of a weird chemical scent. It&#x27;s been many, many years since I have smelled Pert, but I think that&#x27;s the same scent. A weird scent! But, it&#x27;s pretty feint compared to the overwhelming vanilla of the blue -- however, I can still smell it on my hair 2 days after using it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just wouldn&#x27;t recommend this because of the thinness, which is one of he major appeals of the other ones I have tried. The others make my hair seem smooth and worth the cost. This one really does seem to be on par with all the other cheapo ones I have used from the drug store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am of the school that thinks it&#x27;s OK to use cheapo shampoo, since it&#x27;s on your head for so little time and the cleaning process/chemicals is pretty much the same from the cheapo brands to the salon brands. However, having thin strands, thick quantity, and very long hair, I have found the quality matters for conditioner. If you are curious and want to try this brand, I have tried and would recommend the pink and blue ones, but don&#x27;t judge this brand on this green one (which I would not recommend it at all).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went ahead and got the pink one again, I dislike this so much. I will keep this on hand to use if I just have to shower 2 days in a row, so that I don&#x27;t over-condition (my hair gets oily fast if I wash too much, but tangles super easy in the shower).</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this product!!!</li>
            <li> It seems like this conditioner was watered down.</li>
            <li> Got this as a complimentary product to try in my Influenster voxbox.  The scent is really nice.  I&#x27;ve got curly thick hair and would&#x27;ve preferred a thicker conditioner but it did the job!</li>
            <li> I think this conditioner is great. I gave 4 stars because of the price though.  The product was great but I wouldn&#x27;t spend that much again. I can get similar products for less money</li>
            <li> I love it, it smells terrific and makes my hair shine-I smell it all day. my favorite shampoo &amp; conditioner ever!</li>
            <li> Great shampoo and conditioner! I recommend.</li>
            <li> I love the Fekkai hairspray, so I expected to love this Glossing Conditioner as well. Not so much. It left my hair dry and feeling like I had just shampooed and forgotten to condition entirely. I have really thick, full hair that reaches the middle of my back and it is healthy. I take good care of my hair, so for it to feel dry is abnormal. The first night I used it, I thought I might not have used enough...lots of hair &amp; a new product &#x3D; a learning curve. One positive is the scent, it smells fresh and light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Three days later and same problem. Even my husband commented that my hair felt dry when he touched it instead of soft and silky like normal and it looks &amp;#34;off&amp;#34; to him. That does it! In the trash with the Fekkai and back to Treseme for me. I will keep using their hair spray.</li>
            <li> My niece uses this product and she loves it .  She asked me to buy it for her for Christmas so I did .&lt;br /&gt;thank you</li>
            <li> This is my daughters favorite conditioner. Says it is the best item she&#x27;s ever used. I bought this and shampoo for Christmas for her. She&#x27;ll love getting it.</li>
            <li> Nice conditioner, but nothing outstanding.  The texture is not super thick, but is not watery either, it&#x27;s just right.  Has a nice sort of soft lemony scent.  It&#x27;s not a bad conditioner, I just would not get it again.</li>
            <li> good for the price, keeps my color, not too slippery, right balance of moisture.</li>
            <li> I love the Fekkai line.  My hair is noticeably shinier and more manageable than when I use other products.  I now travel with it.  I rarely write reviews, but I love this shampoo/conditioner so much, that I wanted to pass along the feedback.  For reference, my hair is medium thickness and straight.</li>
            <li> I thought that the fragrance was very strong and unpleasant.  They should make it fragrance free.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this glossing conditioner!  My hair is frizzy, very curly, and hard to manage, and after one wash in the glossing shampoo/conditioner, it was the shiniest and least frizzy that I have ever seen it!  I was really impressed, and happy to FINALLY find a product that really works!  Thank you Fekkai!</li>
            <li> This really was light on the hair and really helped this dry and brittle ends of my hair.Loved it!</li>
            <li> I got samples from an Influenster voxbox and I&#x27;m thoroughly impressed by this product as well as the shampoo and styling cream.  They smell fantastic!  Even the husband approves.  It left my hair feeling soft, shiny, and deliciously scented.  My hair feels moisturized and it&#x27;s definitely less frizzy than usual.  You would think I got my hair done at the salon!</li>
            <li> I received a free sample of this conditioner and shampoo from Influenster to try and review.  Unfortunately it was only enough to sample for 2 days so can not review as a long time user.  I have thick curly hair and was impressed with how soft my hair felt after using this product.  It was not heavy and weigh my hair down.  I don&#x27;t care for scented products and happy the light scent did not last long after I styled my hair.  I normally use Suave or Pantene but will buy this and try long term.</li>
            <li> Received as a free sample from Influenster for testing purposes and bought immediately!  It left my hair amazingly soft and smooth!  Definitely recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I have curly frizzy hair. This is the only conditioner I can use to tame my beast.</li>
            <li> I received this product from the company in exchange for an honest review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was really excited to get this since my think, brown hair is dull and I really want it to be shiny and smooth. I used the sample, and it didn&#x27;t do either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also didn&#x27;t really condition my hair at all - my hair gets very tangled and my usual conditioner (Garnied Fructis hydration) really improves this, while the glossing conditioner did not. It seems to work for other types of hair, but not my really thick hair.</li>
            <li> Excellent Conditioner for unruly, frizzy, curly hair like mine! It&#x27;s infused with Olive Oil, so it conditions and soothes the hair and scalp.  very subtle, refreshing fragrance that doesn&#x27;t over-power.  Used in combination with the Fekkai Brilliant Glossing Shampoo, it treats and renourishes the hair. Very impressed with the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* &amp;#34;I received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes.&amp;#34; *</li>
            <li> Works well as a conditioner and makes my hair really soft. However, I did not see any noticeable difference in the shine of my hair after using it. I do not recommend this if you&#x27;re looking for something to visibly increase gloss and for a conditioner it is rather expensive.</li>
            <li> I love this product, it makes your hair feel so soft and if you have color in your hair I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally very dry and dull and I&#x27;m constantly on the look out for a super moisturizing conditioner, bur rarely do I find one that actually fits the bill. This lovely conditioner from Fekkai totally does the trick! My hair felt incredibly moisturized right away, even during my shower while just applying it to my hair! It&#x27;s also a great detangler for unruly hair like mine!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair feels so much softer after using and my hair also has so much more life and looks so much more shinier and healthier, I can&#x27;t stop running my fingers through it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m completely obsessed with this conditioner and will certainly be continuing to use it for a long time to come!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this sample free for the purpose of review from Influenster and Fekkai. #voxbox</li>
            <li> This conditioner was really not good, it was either expired or a different product was bottled in the Fekkai bottle.&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend anyone to buy it.</li>
            <li> The girls have been using this conditioner and the matching shampoo and their hair is as shiny as ever.  My husband complains that it is too hard to tell which is the shampoo and which is the conditioner.  Perhaps color coded bottles or &amp;#34;Step 1&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;Step 2&amp;#34; might help?</li>
            <li> This product works absolutely AMAZING!!! This Fekkai product leaves my hair shinny and smells amazing! Definitely throwing out my old routine and replacing it!!</li>
            <li> My daughter swims 3 times a week. This product works well for her hair.</li>
            <li> Best product for my hair........ever!</li>
            <li> I received this product complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product contains olive oil!  And my hair is smooth and shiny after trying it a few times and I love that it is light weight and does not leave my hair oily or heavy.  I have pretty long hair and this really helps with the manageability of the longer hair.  I love it!</li>
            <li> What can I say? It&#x27;s Fekkai!  It&#x27;s the best.</li>
            <li> I bought this conditioner because I read on another website how good it was. It contains olive oil.  I tried it, although it is a bit pricey, but was so glad i did.  My hair is smooth and frizz free.  My hair has been worked over pretty good with highlights throughout and then, highlights ramped up a bit six weeks later.  My hair looked fried.  Try this, you will have beautiful hair.</li>
            <li> After having been using Coppola products for over 10 years, I cautiously made this purchase. Happy to say product is fantastic! Smells delicious, lathers well and leaves hair smooth.</li>
            <li> I purchased an advanced glossing conditioner by Fekkai last year.  Loved it.  However, when I went to reorder, all that remained was this one.  It&#x27;s okay, but not as great as the advanced glossing conditioner product.</li>
            <li> I have used Fekkai products for years</li>
            <li> Great shampoo, leaves hair with a great shine snd no frizziness.</li>
            <li> I feel like the odd one out here, but I just don&#x27;t get what has everyone so excited about this. I&#x27;m thinking maybe they are using it along with the shampoo (which I haven&#x27;t tried) and with the glossing cream (which I LOVE) and that&#x27;s why they are raving about it maybe? I have graying, colored, often blow dried &amp; straight ironed sad tired ol&#x27; hair. I NEED some major conditioning and usually use some variety of spray leave in conditioner, glossing cream, and spray shine to have the shiny healthy looking hair I want to see in the mirror. Given how much I really love the glossing cream I thought I&#x27;d give this a shot. I purposefully didn&#x27;t use the leave in cream on the several times I tried this (though I did use my normal leave in spray conditioner before drying my hair) and I have to say I&#x27;m not very impressed. It smells nice, it rinses well, but I don&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s super conditioning and I definitely don&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s making my hair glossy at all. Personally I&#x27;ll stick with my normal shampoo/conditioner but will definitely continue to use the glossing leave in cream.</li>
            <li> Love this conditioner!  It smell wonderful!</li>
            <li> I really, really love the Fekkai Brilliant Glossing Shampoo and Conditioner. I switched to these from the Fekkai Technician Shampoo and Conditioner when I stopped highlighting my hair and was very pleased with the results. Lots of shampoos and conditioners promise to make your hair shinier but do so at the cost of weighing it down as well. What&#x27;s the use of having shiny shampoo-commercial-esque hair if it looks as limp as the model&#x27;s mane in the before shots, am I right? I found the Fekkai Brilliant Glossing Cream in this same line to be too heavy for my fine hair, even when I used only a tiny amount. However, the shampoo and conditioner work perfectly and I simply passed my styling product onto a thicker-haired friend. One caveat, I discovered that in the winter when my hair is a little bit drier than normal, I needed a once a week deep conditioning treatment for an extra boost. Not a big deal, really. Most shampoos and conditioners on the market still require me to occasionally give my hair an extra moisture boost. If you hair is like mine, and isn&#x27;t exceptionally dry, this could be your perfect pair as well.</li>
            <li> This conditioner smells so fresh and clean and left my hair feeling super soft and manageable!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with this conditioner; I like it a little better than the shampoo from the same line. It has the same fresh, clean smell. And my hair looks great after using this (for reference, I have color-treated, basically straight, waist-length hair). It doesn&#x27;t leave any residue and it doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down. It also reduces frizz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While the shampoo from the same line is a little thick, this conditioner has the perfect consistency. It&#x27;s very easy to distribute throughout my hair (waist-length).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This does contain at least one paraben and some dyes. This is not a problem for me, but I know some people are concerned about these ingredients, so I thought I&#x27;d pass the information along. I&#x27;ve been using it for maybe two weeks now and my color hasn&#x27;t faded yet. I&#x27;m definitely happy about that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of all the conditioners I&#x27;ve tried this year (quite a few), this is one of my top 2 or 3 favorites. I&#x27;ll probably be buying a full-sized bottle soon (I had a 2 oz. trial size bottle and it ran out).</li>
            <li> Smells fantastic (as do all their products) and works on my terribly damaged bleach blond easily tangled fine hair. Makes it easy to get a comb through in the shower and throughout the day as well.</li>
            <li> First off, this smells incredible. I feel like I&#x27;ve just come from the salon when I use it because I&#x27;m enveloped in the light, clean scent of it. As for glossing, I didn&#x27;t really see an improvement in the shine of my hair. I have naturally curly hair and I don&#x27;t suffer much from lack of shine, so I&#x27;m not sure it is really the fault of the conditioner. I did notice that my hair was more manageable, softer, and did I mention it smelled great? It has a watery texture to it, and I seem to need quite a bit for the medium length of my hair to have enough to go through my hair. My daughters (teenagers) seemed to like it a lot as well.</li>
            <li> IT&#x27;s my favorite and hard to find!  So glad Amazon carries this product....AND at a great price!</li>
            <li> Ah I was hoping that this shampoo would leave my hair soft and shiny. Unfortunately it&#x27;s too greasy/oily and it leaves my hair feeling heavy. I was expecting more for what I paid.</li>
            <li> This literally stinks. I was excited because when I tried it in the shower, my hair felt very silky. But now it&#x27;s died just as frizzy as normal, and more importantly, it stinks. I have a lot of hair, so maybe that has something to do with it, but now the smell of perfume is suffocating me. Really strong smell. Extremely unpleasant to me, even though apparently a lot of people like it. I can&#x27;t wait to wash this out of my hair so I can get rid of the smell.</li>
            <li> I almost feel like the conditioner and shampoo in this collection are backwards. This conditioner is a bit more liquidy and not as thick as most. I honestly can&#x27;t say if it is good at glossing because after I use the duo, my hair actually volumizes a bit and gets frizzy -- like it is overly clean as if I used a clarifying shampoo and conditioner set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like it a lot for cleanliness, but I wish I could get a bit of gloss without needing to flat iron and follow up with antifrizz product everyday.</li>
            <li> I love this glossing conditioner. My hair has the consistency of straw when it is unconditioned. Left to its own devices, it can look pretty flyaway and frizzy.  I had been using Wen products for a few years now, but am looking around because they do not seem as effective as they once were.  Fekkai products tend to work better when you are using the matching shampoos and conditioners., but in this case, the conditioner alone, was fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Glossing conditioner also worked very well as a detangler.  My hair is about half curly and half straight, although that is probably caused by the heaviness of it.  But detanglers often work best on the straightest parts â€“ usually the longest hair, while leaving the curly hair mostly tangled and messy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I loved that it had olive oil in it, even if it was the 5th ingredient.  I have used olive oil before and while it does wonderful shiny things to my hair, it also was a nightmare to wash out.  It is very difficult to get the oil in evenly and then to wash out enough of it while leaving the amount that kept it shiny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love what this conditioner does.</li>
            <li> This works great. My hair is very glossy, and I actually feel more brilliant!</li>
            <li> I only had a sample size of this to try out once. It smelled nice, but I didn&#x27;t care for anything else about the conditioner itself. I prefer a thick conditioner that makes the hair feel soft and easy to brush in the shower and I can&#x27;t say that this did that for me. It was too light for my hair type</li>
            <li> I received this product compliments of @influenster and love it. It has made my hair shiny and more alive looking.  My hair is moisturized and glossy and feels soft and bouncy.  I haven seen to along with the Fekkai Shampoo. I will continue to use this product as I love the results.</li>
