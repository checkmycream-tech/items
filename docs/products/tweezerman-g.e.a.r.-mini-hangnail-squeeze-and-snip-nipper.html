            <li>Perfect for a man&#x27;s travel kit.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s perfect for on-the-go touchups!</li>
            <li>Very happy when I located this, and on Amazon at a fair price.</li>
            <li>Great tool for your mani pedi kit.</li>
            <li>So happy to find more of these.</li>
            <li>Love these, great for cuticles</li>
            <li>I am in love with these!  </li>
            <li>I love these!</li>
            <li>Every person should own a pair of these.  </li>
            <li>Perfect size, sharp and great tweezerman quality.  </li>
            <li>Much more effective at clipping hangnails than clippers.</li>
            <li>These are one of the most easy to use cuticle trimmers on earth!  </li>
            <li>Teeny, easier to use, better results.</li>
            <li>Another top notch product I didn&#x27;t even know I needed</li>
            <li>and it does the job better than any tool I was halfway using to get hang nails before.</li>
            <li>Use with cuticle oil or cuticle softener for even better results.</li>
            <li>Really great little tool for cuticles and great size for travel</li>
            <li>bought this for travelling and it worked better than the full size cuticle clipper.</li>
            <li>because if someone doesn&#x27;t know what they are doing, they could EASILY become very</li>
            <li>, they don&#x27;t take the place of cuticle nippers but they are useful.</li>
            <li>I just wish it didn&#x27;t cost so much!</li>
            <li>I bought my first Tweezerman hangnail nipper about 5 years ago.  </li>
            <li>From the first use, I was hooked.  </li>
            <li>Awesome tool, used mine to pull some small stitches in my finger, the really tiny ones.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Works just as well as the large version.</li>
            <li>A very sharp, very easy to manipulate cuticle clipper.</li>
            <li>I really like these</li>
            <li>I miss the real ones</li>
            <li>lol I highly recommend them to get those small places you cant\&#x27;t reach with regular clippers, hangnails, ingrown toenails or any number of uses.</li>
            <li>If you have very still hands, keen eyesight, and above average depth perception, these will work great for you (especially for pesky hangnails)</li>
            <li>/&gt;Probably not okay to endorse it for this, but just saying, if you have to work on something tiny like this, next to sensitive skin, it works great!</li>
            <li>You do need to be careful as you can easily cut yourself.  </li>
            <li>This is a great little tool, very sharp.  </li>
            <li>Tweezerman used to make V-Nippers which was a normal size.  </li>
            <li>and I wanted to try something new.  </li>
            <li>These are tiny and really unstable in your hand.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a professional nail tech of 15+ years</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never used tradition cuticle clippers/nippers, so it&#x27;s difficult for me to compare this product to those, but these are exactly like holding a pair of tweezers, except that you have to apply much more pressure than you do with tweezers.</li>
            <li>The profile of these little guys is a fraction of the standard cuticle nippers and they do the job better than those big old things.</li>
            <li>Nips clear and cleanly, does not leave any little slip of skin next to the nailbed.  </li>
            <li>If it cost half as much i&#x27;d give them away as gifts!</li>
            <li>Be careful and ultra-precise with your aim when using this nipper; like a good quality knife, it&#x27;s so sharp you won&#x27;t feel the wound until too late!</li>

            <li> I hate every cuticle nipper in the world -- except this one. I ADORE this one. Teeny, easier to use, better results. I just wish it didn&#x27;t cost so much! If it cost half as much i&#x27;d give them away as gifts!</li>
            <li> I am a tweezer SNOB. Tweezerman delivers yet again. Another top notch product I didn&#x27;t even know I needed and it does the job better than any tool I was halfway using to get hang nails before. This tool is SHARP though and shouldnt be considered a tweezer in any capacity as it cuts when the tips meet- be careful with children/curious husbands.</li>
            <li> These are one of the most easy to use cuticle trimmers on earth!  I buy them for my purse, home and day spa.  The best!!!  I have ever had a pair I dropped on tile sharpened back to working order.</li>
            <li> Works excellently at its intended purpose--the destruction of hangnails.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I am plagued with extremely dry cuticles.  This is a great little tool, very sharp.  You do need to be careful as you can easily cut yourself.  I really like these, they don&#x27;t take the place of cuticle nippers but they are useful.</li>
            <li> Iutstanding quality as well as performance. Well done !</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought my share of nippers over the years, including Seiki, Hoffritz (remember them? RIP), other Tweezerman nipper implements, and the usual mass-merch brands. Only the Hoffritz came close to the precision and sharpness of this tool. After mine disappeared during travel, I tried other replacements because couldn&#x27;t find this item sold solo (I&#x27;d bought it in a &amp;#34;rescue&amp;#34; kit) and didn&#x27;t know the name of this implement. But none came close. Very happy when I located this, and on Amazon at a fair price. Be careful and ultra-precise with your aim when using this nipper; like a good quality knife, it&#x27;s so sharp you won&#x27;t feel the wound until too late! :o&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I wanted the smaller version for tight spaces. Works just as well as the large version.</li>
            <li> You know how when you get a rash, you&#x27;re not supposed to scratch but then you do anyway because it drives you crazy? That&#x27;s how I am with hangnails. I can&#x27;t help myself from picking at them until it turns ugly. To avoid this unfortunate state of affairs I keep cuticle nippers on my person at all times. That is, until came across these. The profile of these little guys is a fraction of the standard cuticle nippers and they do the job better than those big old things. And bonus--they&#x27;re about half the price!</li>
            <li> These are great!!!! I have used them for several years and this was a replacement pair. I guess they do eventually get dull after several years...lol I highly recommend them to get those small places you cant\&#x27;t reach with regular clippers, hangnails, ingrown toenails or any number of uses.</li>

            <li> So happy to find more of these. A very sharp, very easy to manipulate cuticle clipper.</li>
            <li> Perfect for those pesky hangnails. Well made.</li>
            <li> bought this for travelling and it worked better than the full size cuticle clipper. Great tool for your mani pedi kit.Use with cuticle oil or cuticle softener for even better results.</li>
            <li> I bought my first Tweezerman hangnail nipper about 5 years ago.  Yes, I know they are marketed to men, but I have the cuticles from Hell and I wanted to try something new.  From the first use, I was hooked.  These nippers beat the heck out of cuticle scissors every day of the week.  Nips clear and cleanly, does not leave any little slip of skin next to the nailbed.  Get a full-size nipper one for your manicure box at home, and buy a mini for your makeup case in your purse or briefcase.</li>
            <li> I am in love with these!  Perfect size, sharp and great tweezerman quality.  A must for any girls handbag.</li>
            <li> Awesome product as all Tweezerman&#x27;s are. I love these! As an RN, they loose 1 ðŸŒŸ because if someone doesn&#x27;t know what they are doing, they could EASILY become very</li>
            <li> Every person should own a pair of these.  Much more effective at clipping hangnails than clippers.</li>

If you have very still hands, keen eyesight, and above average depth perception, these will work great for you (especially for pesky hangnails) otherwise, I&#x27;d say stick with traditional cuticle clippers.</li>

            <li> Perfect for a man&#x27;s travel kit. It is sharp, looks sleek, and works.</li>
            <li> I saw this reviewed in Urbanette Magazine so I bought it to keep in my purse. It&#x27;s perfect for on-the-go touchups!</li>
            <li> Tweezerman used to make V-Nippers which was a normal size.  These are tiny and really unstable in your hand.  I miss the real ones and I wish Tweezerman would get the message and make these a usable size. I&#x27;m a professional nail tech of 15+ years and I won&#x27;t use these on my clients.</li>
            <li> Love these, great for cuticles</li>
