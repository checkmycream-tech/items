            <li>I love both.  </li>
            <li>I am very happy with it for several reasons.  </li>
            <li>I love this Anti Aging Face Moisturizer Cream.</li>

            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>and I can&#x27;t believe how much better they look.</li>
            <li>I so love this product.</li>
            <li>What I noticed the most, after using it for over a month, is that it evened out my skin tone and helped with redness.  </li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll have to decide for yourself but the price is good, so worth giving it a try.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Follow up-the longer I use these products the better results, my skin really looks and feels great.</li>
            <li>I have noticed that my face is feeling a bit more elastic and &amp;#34;fuller&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>I combined it with the Hyaluronic Acid Serum and the Total Repair Eye gel and the changes have been awesome!</li>
            <li>I have not changed anything but the use of these products and I have been getting soo many comments and compliments about the quality of my skin,</li>
            <li>My experience: I was most hesitant to try this one, as Iâ€™ve just had better lucks with serums and gels compared to creams.</li>
            <li>fast delivery great transacton</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it morning and night and love it.</li>
            <li>I love this moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>so I just unscrew the top and get a dab out that way.</li>
            <li>I use this in conjunction with the Hyaluronic acid serum and my face feels better than it ever has.  </li>
            <li>OK but fragrance was problem.</li>
            <li>I use the vitamin C serum from them, then use this on top of that, and my skin has never felt better.</li>

            <li>The moisturizer is creamy and easily glides onto my skin without any greasy feeling.  </li>

            <li>I had an issue with my first bottle and the customer service was great and got a new bottle out to me asap.</li>
            <li>I am new to the idea of fruit cell science for anti aging products  but leaning towards thinking it is a good thing because this cream is sweet on the face.  </li>

            <li>I like the light lotion, and how it absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>I have only been using this product for about two weeks, but so far, I am really impressed with it.</li>

            <li>So far, this moisturizer is amazing.</li>
            <li>My makeup goes on very well on top of this moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I feel like this would be a gentle and organic option for so many.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s not bad ...</li>

            <li>More for your buck and get same or better results.  </li>
            <li>I was glad to find this face cream, especially since it contained so many of the things I have been learning about.  </li>
            <li>Lightweight and absorbs quickly, softening and hydrating the skin.  </li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly into my skin.</li>
            <li>It works beautifully as a foundation of sorts for my makeup and there is little to no scent.</li>
            <li>The only drawback I will mention is the smell when you first apply the moisturizer Is not as pleasant as some others (non-organic) I have used.</li>
            <li>My skin looks great, the ingredients are all natural and the price is more reasonable than what I was formerly using.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve purchased the vitamin C serum previously  and continue to find their products good for my skin with fine results and no allergic reactions.</li>
            <li>It has a slight fragrance, which I wasn&#x27;t too sure if I liked, but it dissipated quickly and I don&#x27;t notice it anymore.</li>
            <li>Sure for the first couple minutes, then is soaks in and I&#x27;m ready for the ranch, or bed......</li>
            <li>I wish I could use it on my whole body!!  </li>
            <li>dont like perfumy products and usually get things unscented, but this one has a lovely light rose scent.</li>
            <li>Plus, the price of many single items is more than both of these together.</li>
            <li>Even with forgetting it has helped smooth my face and diminish the appearance of my naturally large pores.</li>
            <li>I really like the light cream non-greasy texture and the fragrance.</li>
            <li>and I love the natural ingredients.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t feel greasy, and soaks in well leaving my face feeling fresh and hydrated.</li>
            <li>My skin is so soft and healthy looking.</li>
            <li>but I think its worth it.</li>
            <li>My pores are waaaaaay less noticeable and my skin feels amazing!</li>
            <li>Great customer service as well, very prompt and extremely helpful.</li>
            <li>It smells good but a bit sharp.</li>
            <li>; and I flitter from product to product trying to find the right one.</li>
            <li>The smallest minor I had with the cream was that I wasn&#x27;t too impressed with the container, but the actually cream works great, so that is a very small con.</li>
            <li>I love the light floral scent and it&#x27;s sheer enough that makeup goes over it easily.</li>
            <li>They are quick drying and very moisturizing.  </li>
            <li>It dries in literally seconds and leaves my face feeling smooth and soft!</li>
            <li>When I get low, I will be ordering more right away.</li>
            <li>It has a very gentle scent, will not interfere with perfume or makeup.</li>
            <li>I LOVE the new face lotion, I love that it is organic and there are only high quality ingredients.</li>
            <li>I am fine with aging and the visual effects, but like any woman I want to do what I can to keep my skin healthy and soft.  </li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly and absorbs to keep your face soft and moisturized all day.</li>
            <li>Looking forward to trying out more products in the future with this company.</li>
            <li>Definitely makes skin feel softer and more elastic.</li>
            <li>I have added this moisturizer to my daily routine and LOVE it.</li>
            <li>It appears smoother and my pores are not as evident as they used to be.</li>
            <li>I really recommend this moisturizer!</li>
            <li>This cream feels so rich but not heavy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m getting older, my skin is getting drier and I want quick and easy moisture that helps my skin to look and feel younger.  </li>
            <li>My only problem with it is the smell is pretty strong.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to get this and a few more products from this line in.</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly into my skin, contains 100% natural - 85% organic ingredients and is made in the USA.  </li>
            <li>This product has a pump dispenser so it is easy to dispense just the amount I need, so it will last me for a while.  </li>
            <li>It takes about a minute to absorb, but once it does, my skin is super soft and hydrated.</li>
            <li>The bottle dispenser has a convenient pump with small opening which I like so it does not give out too much at a time and the size is good for my hand.</li>
            <li>but I would certainly use the moisturizer alone, with a sunscreen for day and as a night cream too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Back</li>
            <li>I really like this face cream.</li>
            <li>The skin feels tighter and I really feel like it&#x27;s working to prevent wrinkles.</li>
            <li>I really like the way this cream feels on my face.</li>
            <li>so it is important that I have a moisturizer that is not greasy when mixed with my medication.</li>
            <li>I feel much safer putting it on my skin.  </li>
            <li>the pump bottle is a very convenient feature.  </li>
            <li>Very moisturizing.  </li>
            <li>This works very well for me.</li>
            <li>Very absorbent and non greasy.  </li>
            <li>Absorbs fast since my job causes me to sweat fast.  </li>
            <li>It came fast</li>
            <li>Gentle for face.</li>
            <li>I received an email with tips on how to use this product which was very helpful.</li>
            <li>and this is really helping with youthful glo.</li>
            <li>I would absolutely recommend this product and will continue to purchase this anti aging moisturizer from Amara.</li>
            <li>My usually dry, dry, dry skin is looking great!</li>
            <li>I also really appreciate the addition of vitamins in the formula.</li>
            <li>The product shipped fast and I received within days.  </li>
            <li>They look and feel much softer.  </li>
            <li>but it doesn&#x27;t really bother me.  </li>
            <li>I really prefer using organic products with no animal testing and this fits the bill.</li>
            <li>This moisturizer works for me very well.</li>
            <li>Except kept me from putting a real moisturizer on.</li>
            <li>Very spa-like.</li>
            <li>Absorbs well and fast.</li>
            <li>I waited to write this review to see if it really works.</li>
            <li>The lines on my forehead, lips, and eyes are really minimizing.</li>
            <li>As a group, they really work well together.</li>
            <li>I am sensitive to most facial moisturizers but this one hasn&#x27;t given me any issues!</li>
            <li>, I just know they feel good and work at least on</li>
            <li>I mean, who couldn&#x27;t use a good moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>It feels a bit sticky at first, but it gets absorbed fast enough.</li>
            <li>I ordered this because I wanted something that I thought would be gentle for super sensitive adult acne prone skin.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t even know it until it arrived, but Amara is a local company to me and made right in my home town!</li>
            <li>:) I have sensitive skin, dry in patches, somewhat oily in others.</li>
            <li>Getting past the unique smell, it does glide on smoothly and seem to moisturize my skin.</li>
            <li>I am into removing any toxins I can from my family, and so I am interested in natural and organic products.  </li>
            <li>Makes my skin vibrant and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feel.</li>
            <li>to the main ingredient, Fruit Stem Cells.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many expensive products over the years and this reasonably priced moisturizer ranks right up there!!</li>
            <li>It is very smooth and silky to apply, and one thing I like about the bottle is that one pump doesn&#x27;t give out too much so waste is avoided.</li>
            <li>Will update when I&#x27;ve been using it for long enough to see results in any fine lines!</li>
            <li>The smell is a little interesting.</li>
            <li>It is very subtle and pleasant.</li>
            <li>Probably due to its pure and organic ingredients this cream is completely different, it makes my skin feel like itâ€™s breathing better</li>
            <li>I use it in combination with the companies other products and feel that my fine lines are fading.  </li>
            <li>However, I love the all natural ingredients and the way it glides on without leaving me a greasy mess.  </li>
            <li>New skin for me.</li>
            <li>I will be looking forward to any new products they add to their line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m always looking for new skin cream that will prevent or keep wrinkles at bay.  </li>
            <li>(no i dont have super dry skin).</li>
            <li>I love that it is natural and organic and doesnâ€™t have a heavy smell.</li>
            <li>This works much better than my old moisturizer and it costs less!</li>
            <li>The smell is very soft and not overpowering.</li>
            <li>I especially like the very gentle feeling of both products when applied to my skin.  </li>
            <li>I love that it is 100% natural and made in the USA, full of vitamins and antioxidants that help my skin feel nourished and radiant, unlike all those department store creams that are full of chemicals and other toxins that are irritating to your skin.  </li>
            <li>and I have noticed less fine lines on my forehead.</li>
            <li>I am excited to try the other products in their line.</li>
            <li>I feel like my skin looks a lot better in the past month of using it because it keeps me hydrated like a morning dewy rain.</li>
            <li>no heavy greasy feeling!</li>
            <li>Okay, there is a different smell with this lotion which I understand is due to the natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>I live in a very dry climate, and when I use this, I do not wake up feeling like my skin is dehydrated, I feel fresh.</li>
            <li>I typically have super sensitive skin, so anything new tends to break me out.</li>
            <li>It is a light cream that doesn&#x27;t sit heavily on my skin but absorbs directly without an oily feeling.</li>
            <li>Hopefully my skin will remain clear.  </li>
            <li>The lotion is lightweight, but has enough substance to really feel the moisture.</li>
            <li>is natural and organic.  </li>
            <li>It helps my skin feel soft but not oily.</li>
            <li>I gave this moisturizer to my 70yr old mother and she loves it.</li>
            <li>but this product did not do that to my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I found my neck (creping) was the one thing that made me look and feel old.</li>
            <li>It leaves your face feeling so soft.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 63 years old</li>
            <li>This cream glides softly on my skin without leaving any oily residues.</li>
            <li>I like the soft scent in the cream.</li>
            <li>This has not irritated my sensitive skin, and my fiancÃ© loves to use it to sooth his skin after shaving.</li>
            <li>So far I am liking this product also.</li>
            <li>pleasantly surprised with this product.</li>
            <li>So far no breakouts or sensitivity issues.</li>
            <li>The skin on that hand is so soft.</li>
            <li>I have somewhat sensitive skin</li>
            <li>This is an all natural moisturizer that does just what it - softens, hydrates, and repairs skin.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s no heavy smell -</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;ve had no reactions either.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and have had no problems.  </li>
            <li>I have been using it for about a week now and it keeps my face soft but doesn&#x27;t cause any breakouts</li>
            <li>It makes my face feel firm and smooth</li>
            <li>I am so pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a 48 year old man who has always had the benefit of my mother&#x27;s genes (she is 73 and looks more like late 50s), but I cannot continue to rely on that.</li>
            <li>My left hand looks much younger than my right one.</li>
            <li>My skin is pretty sensitive and oily yet feels very dry..  </li>
            <li>I do find that I need a little more than one pump of this to evenly cover my skin, but I would rather be over moisturized than dry.</li>
            <li>No more redness and the couple of fairly light spots I had are gone.  </li>
            <li>The smell is nice and not overpowering which is a problem that I have had with other moisturizers in the past.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have to use much and I can say that this mosturizer is better than any others I&#x27;ve tried (and I&#x27;ve tried expensive - Clinique and in-expensive, Nutrogena, Oil of Olay, etc.).  </li>
            <li>I am starting now while I am young (33)</li>
            <li>I live in colorado and battle dry skin.  </li>
            <li>So far, absolutely no new breakouts and the old breakouts are actually healing.  </li>
            <li>The clever pump only dispenses enough cream that goes a long way.</li>
            <li>I have a sensitive acne-prone skin and have bought many different moisturizers that unfortunately gave me breakouts.</li>
            <li>And that is saying something for a 72 yr old living in a dry climate.</li>

            <li> Experienced some breakouts at first, but maybe my skin had to get used to it.</li>
            <li> I need some help fighting these darn fine line and wrinkles!</li>

            <li> So silky smooth!</li>
            <li> I am pleased with it.  </li>
            <li> I started using Amara vitamin C serum and the hyaluronic acid serum and am pleased with those products and decided to try the moisturizer also.  </li>

            <li> and I can&#x27;t believe how much better they look.</li>
            <li> I so love this product.</li>
            <li> What I noticed the most, after using it for over a month, is that it evened out my skin tone and helped with redness.  </li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll have to decide for yourself but the price is good, so worth giving it a try.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Follow up-the longer I use these products the better results, my skin really looks and feels great.</li>
            <li> I have noticed that my face is feeling a bit more elastic and &amp;#34;fuller&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> I combined it with the Hyaluronic Acid Serum and the Total Repair Eye gel and the changes have been awesome!</li>
            <li> I have not changed anything but the use of these products and I have been getting soo many comments and compliments about the quality of my skin,</li>
            <li> My experience: I was most hesitant to try this one, as Iâ€™ve just had better lucks with serums and gels compared to creams.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it morning and night and love it.</li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> so I just unscrew the top and get a dab out that way.</li>
            <li> I use this in conjunction with the Hyaluronic acid serum and my face feels better than it ever has.  </li>
            <li> OK but fragrance was problem.</li>

            <li> It has a pleasant scent and goes on the skin nicely and does not leave face feeling greasy at all, so far, I would recommend this product.</li>

            <li> She says she likes it because it is not too greasy and helps her face feel clean and refreshing.</li>
            <li> The moisturizer is creamy and easily glides onto my skin without any greasy feeling.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Another thing is vest strong smell which suggest the use of chemicals and alcohols.&lt;br /&gt;Also, be careful,it ll make you break out like</li>
            <li> I am using this with the Amara Organics Vitamin C serum, ad I strongly believe that using both products together has aided in my skin&#x27;s improvement.</li>

            <li> I had an issue with my first bottle and the customer service was great and got a new bottle out to me asap.</li>
            <li> I am new to the idea of fruit cell science for anti aging products  but leaning towards thinking it is a good thing because this cream is sweet on the face.  </li>

            <li> First off, I LOVE that is</li>
            <li> The bottle is a great size and I feel like it will last me a good while even with daily use.</li>
            <li> I would definitely be interested in purchasing more products from this company.</li>
            <li> This product smells so good, it has a little bit of a rose smell.</li>
            <li> It goes on so smoothly and dries quickly without being sticky or greasy.  </li>
            <li> Well, initially I did have to pump it many times for it to start coming out of the pump, but then it did work and comes out nice.  </li>
            <li> I like the light lotion, and how it absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> I have only been using this product for about two weeks, but so far, I am really impressed with it.</li>
            <li> and I can certainly tell that the skin on my face looks way better.</li>
            <li> So far, this moisturizer is amazing.</li>
            <li> My makeup goes on very well on top of this moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I feel like this would be a gentle and organic option for so many.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not bad ...</li>
            <li> I love it and will definitely be buying more.</li>
            <li> More for your buck and get same or better results.  </li>
            <li> I was glad to find this face cream, especially since it contained so many of the things I have been learning about.  </li>
            <li> Lightweight and absorbs quickly, softening and hydrating the skin.  </li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly into my skin.</li>
            <li> It works beautifully as a foundation of sorts for my makeup and there is little to no scent.</li>
            <li> The only drawback I will mention is the smell when you first apply the moisturizer Is not as pleasant as some others (non-organic) I have used.</li>
            <li> My skin looks great, the ingredients are all natural and the price is more reasonable than what I was formerly using.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased the vitamin C serum previously  and continue to find their products good for my skin with fine results and no allergic reactions.</li>
            <li> It has a slight fragrance, which I wasn&#x27;t too sure if I liked, but it dissipated quickly and I don&#x27;t notice it anymore.</li>
            <li> Sure for the first couple minutes, then is soaks in and I&#x27;m ready for the ranch, or bed......</li>
            <li> I wish I could use it on my whole body!!  </li>
            <li> dont like perfumy products and usually get things unscented, but this one has a lovely light rose scent.</li>
            <li> Plus, the price of many single items is more than both of these together.</li>
            <li> Even with forgetting it has helped smooth my face and diminish the appearance of my naturally large pores.</li>
            <li> I really like the light cream non-greasy texture and the fragrance.</li>
            <li> and I love the natural ingredients.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t feel greasy, and soaks in well leaving my face feeling fresh and hydrated.</li>
            <li> My skin is so soft and healthy looking.</li>
            <li> but I think its worth it.</li>
            <li> My pores are waaaaaay less noticeable and my skin feels amazing!</li>
            <li> Great customer service as well, very prompt and extremely helpful.</li>
            <li> It smells good but a bit sharp.</li>
            <li> ; and I flitter from product to product trying to find the right one.</li>
            <li> The smallest minor I had with the cream was that I wasn&#x27;t too impressed with the container, but the actually cream works great, so that is a very small con.</li>
            <li> I love the light floral scent and it&#x27;s sheer enough that makeup goes over it easily.</li>
            <li> They are quick drying and very moisturizing.  </li>
            <li> It dries in literally seconds and leaves my face feeling smooth and soft!</li>
            <li> When I get low, I will be ordering more right away.</li>
            <li> It has a very gentle scent, will not interfere with perfume or makeup.</li>
            <li> I LOVE the new face lotion, I love that it is organic and there are only high quality ingredients.</li>
            <li> I am fine with aging and the visual effects, but like any woman I want to do what I can to keep my skin healthy and soft.  </li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly and absorbs to keep your face soft and moisturized all day.</li>
            <li> Looking forward to trying out more products in the future with this company.</li>
            <li> Definitely makes skin feel softer and more elastic.</li>
            <li> I have added this moisturizer to my daily routine and LOVE it.</li>
            <li> It appears smoother and my pores are not as evident as they used to be.</li>
            <li> I really recommend this moisturizer!</li>
            <li> This cream feels so rich but not heavy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m getting older, my skin is getting drier and I want quick and easy moisture that helps my skin to look and feel younger.  </li>
            <li> My only problem with it is the smell is pretty strong.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to get this and a few more products from this line in.</li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly into my skin, contains 100% natural - 85% organic ingredients and is made in the USA.  </li>
            <li> This product has a pump dispenser so it is easy to dispense just the amount I need, so it will last me for a while.  </li>
            <li> It takes about a minute to absorb, but once it does, my skin is super soft and hydrated.</li>
            <li> The bottle dispenser has a convenient pump with small opening which I like so it does not give out too much at a time and the size is good for my hand.</li>
            <li> but I would certainly use the moisturizer alone, with a sunscreen for day and as a night cream too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Back</li>
            <li> I really like this face cream.</li>
            <li> The skin feels tighter and I really feel like it&#x27;s working to prevent wrinkles.</li>
            <li> I really like the way this cream feels on my face.</li>
            <li> so it is important that I have a moisturizer that is not greasy when mixed with my medication.</li>
            <li> I feel much safer putting it on my skin.  </li>
            <li> the pump bottle is a very convenient feature.  </li>
            <li> Very moisturizing.  </li>
            <li> This works very well for me.</li>
            <li> Very absorbent and non greasy.  </li>
            <li> Absorbs fast since my job causes me to sweat fast.  </li>
            <li> It came fast</li>
            <li> Gentle for face.</li>
            <li> I received an email with tips on how to use this product which was very helpful.</li>
            <li> and this is really helping with youthful glo.</li>
            <li> I would absolutely recommend this product and will continue to purchase this anti aging moisturizer from Amara.</li>
            <li> My usually dry, dry, dry skin is looking great!</li>
            <li> I also really appreciate the addition of vitamins in the formula.</li>
            <li> The product shipped fast and I received within days.  </li>
            <li> They look and feel much softer.  </li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t really bother me.  </li>
            <li> I really prefer using organic products with no animal testing and this fits the bill.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer works for me very well.</li>
            <li> Except kept me from putting a real moisturizer on.</li>
            <li> Very spa-like.</li>
            <li> Absorbs well and fast.</li>
            <li> I waited to write this review to see if it really works.</li>
            <li> The lines on my forehead, lips, and eyes are really minimizing.</li>
            <li> As a group, they really work well together.</li>
            <li> I am sensitive to most facial moisturizers but this one hasn&#x27;t given me any issues!</li>
            <li> , I just know they feel good and work at least on</li>
            <li> I mean, who couldn&#x27;t use a good moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> It feels a bit sticky at first, but it gets absorbed fast enough.</li>
            <li> I ordered this because I wanted something that I thought would be gentle for super sensitive adult acne prone skin.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t even know it until it arrived, but Amara is a local company to me and made right in my home town!</li>
            <li> :) I have sensitive skin, dry in patches, somewhat oily in others.</li>
            <li> Getting past the unique smell, it does glide on smoothly and seem to moisturize my skin.</li>
            <li> I am into removing any toxins I can from my family, and so I am interested in natural and organic products.  </li>
            <li> Makes my skin vibrant and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feel.</li>
            <li> to the main ingredient, Fruit Stem Cells.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many expensive products over the years and this reasonably priced moisturizer ranks right up there!!</li>
            <li> It is very smooth and silky to apply, and one thing I like about the bottle is that one pump doesn&#x27;t give out too much so waste is avoided.</li>
            <li> Will update when I&#x27;ve been using it for long enough to see results in any fine lines!</li>
            <li> The smell is a little interesting.</li>
            <li> It is very subtle and pleasant.</li>
            <li> Probably due to its pure and organic ingredients this cream is completely different, it makes my skin feel like itâ€™s breathing better</li>
            <li> I use it in combination with the companies other products and feel that my fine lines are fading.  </li>
            <li> However, I love the all natural ingredients and the way it glides on without leaving me a greasy mess.  </li>
            <li> New skin for me.</li>
            <li> I will be looking forward to any new products they add to their line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always looking for new skin cream that will prevent or keep wrinkles at bay.  </li>
            <li> (no i dont have super dry skin).</li>
            <li> I love that it is natural and organic and doesnâ€™t have a heavy smell.</li>
            <li> This works much better than my old moisturizer and it costs less!</li>
            <li> The smell is very soft and not overpowering.</li>
            <li> I especially like the very gentle feeling of both products when applied to my skin.  </li>
            <li> I love that it is 100% natural and made in the USA, full of vitamins and antioxidants that help my skin feel nourished and radiant, unlike all those department store creams that are full of chemicals and other toxins that are irritating to your skin.  </li>
            <li> and I have noticed less fine lines on my forehead.</li>
            <li> I am excited to try the other products in their line.</li>
            <li> I feel like my skin looks a lot better in the past month of using it because it keeps me hydrated like a morning dewy rain.</li>
            <li> no heavy greasy feeling!</li>
            <li> Okay, there is a different smell with this lotion which I understand is due to the natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> I live in a very dry climate, and when I use this, I do not wake up feeling like my skin is dehydrated, I feel fresh.</li>
            <li> I typically have super sensitive skin, so anything new tends to break me out.</li>
            <li> It is a light cream that doesn&#x27;t sit heavily on my skin but absorbs directly without an oily feeling.</li>
            <li> Hopefully my skin will remain clear.  </li>
            <li> The lotion is lightweight, but has enough substance to really feel the moisture.</li>
            <li> is natural and organic.  </li>
            <li> It helps my skin feel soft but not oily.</li>
            <li> I gave this moisturizer to my 70yr old mother and she loves it.</li>
            <li> but this product did not do that to my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I found my neck (creping) was the one thing that made me look and feel old.</li>
            <li> It leaves your face feeling so soft.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 63 years old</li>
            <li> This cream glides softly on my skin without leaving any oily residues.</li>
            <li> I like the soft scent in the cream.</li>
            <li> This has not irritated my sensitive skin, and my fiancÃ© loves to use it to sooth his skin after shaving.</li>
            <li> So far I am liking this product also.</li>
            <li> pleasantly surprised with this product.</li>
            <li> So far no breakouts or sensitivity issues.</li>
            <li> The skin on that hand is so soft.</li>
            <li> I have somewhat sensitive skin</li>
            <li> This is an all natural moisturizer that does just what it - softens, hydrates, and repairs skin.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no heavy smell -</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve had no reactions either.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and have had no problems.  </li>
            <li> I have been using it for about a week now and it keeps my face soft but doesn&#x27;t cause any breakouts</li>
            <li> It makes my face feel firm and smooth</li>
            <li> I am so pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 48 year old man who has always had the benefit of my mother&#x27;s genes (she is 73 and looks more like late 50s), but I cannot continue to rely on that.</li>
            <li> My left hand looks much younger than my right one.</li>
            <li> My skin is pretty sensitive and oily yet feels very dry..  </li>
            <li> I do find that I need a little more than one pump of this to evenly cover my skin, but I would rather be over moisturized than dry.</li>
            <li> No more redness and the couple of fairly light spots I had are gone.  </li>
            <li> The smell is nice and not overpowering which is a problem that I have had with other moisturizers in the past.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to use much and I can say that this mosturizer is better than any others I&#x27;ve tried (and I&#x27;ve tried expensive - Clinique and in-expensive, Nutrogena, Oil of Olay, etc.).  </li>
            <li> I am starting now while I am young (33)</li>
            <li> I live in colorado and battle dry skin.  </li>
            <li> So far, absolutely no new breakouts and the old breakouts are actually healing.  </li>
            <li> The clever pump only dispenses enough cream that goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I have a sensitive acne-prone skin and have bought many different moisturizers that unfortunately gave me breakouts.</li>
            <li> And that is saying something for a 72 yr old living in a dry climate.</li>
            <li> It is lightweight and not heavy like some other facial creams are.</li>
            <li> You only have to use just a small amount to cover your whole face.</li>
            <li> She usually uses olay, which she really can&#x27;t afford.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually write reviews, but really felt compelled to do so with Amara Organics products.</li>
            <li> All the gross, dry cracks are gone.</li>
            <li> and like the others is tackling problems such as wrinkles or dry skin.</li>
            <li> Most Moisturizer creams make my face feel like i have a dirty face or like my skin cant breath.</li>
            <li> I suffer from dry dry dry skin on my face, and the combination of these two products are the ONLY thing that I&#x27;ve tried (and I&#x27;ve tried a lot) that work for me.  </li>
            <li> I was in search of an organic mosturizer as I have sensative skin and usually break out when I try new products - I did not with this one.  </li>
            <li> I just received the Anti Aging Face Cream Moisturizer the other day, so I can only comment on the scent and consistency,</li>
            <li> Now that I&#x27;ve seen the results, I will now use it on my other hand so they both look younger!</li>
            <li> I layer this with the other products and this is the last thing I apply</li>
            <li> My face has a glow to it and no longer has dry spots.</li>
            <li> the products feels like it makes my skin dry.</li>
            <li> It has nourishing vitamins and and anti-oxidants that work well in the dry winter heat.</li>
            <li> It is lightweight and non-greasy and has no alcohol to dry out your skin.</li>
            <li> This did NOTHING for my dry skin.</li>
            <li> My skin is very dry with redness around the cheeks.</li>
            <li> I have to be careful with creams on my face because i always brake out.</li>
            <li> She has used a few different products for face cream and moisturizing, etc...</li>
            <li> Unfortunately not satisfied with this product - Will probably send back within the next few days!</li>
            <li> I use it with conjunction with some of the other Amara Organics products.</li>
            <li> Could be the other ingredients or the Fruit Stem Cells.  </li>
            <li> Only used one month , I put it on neck and face, so hard to tell if there&#x27;s results.</li>
            <li> are organic because the face is such a delicate area.</li>
            <li> I has gotten rid of the dark circles under my eyes and my face feels tighter.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t weigh down the skin or clog pores.</li>
            <li> The pump dispenses a very small amount of lotion and it only takes four pumps for both hands.  </li>
            <li> Only been using this for a short period of time, so I&#x27;m unable to comment on any results.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s half the price.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not super fragrant, but it&#x27;s just not</li>
            <li> and i started to notice a slight plump in my skin after a week or so of using it.  </li>
            <li> It is lightweight, absorbs quickly and thankfully hasn&#x27;t given any bad reaction on my face.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little pricey</li>
            <li> Will continue to use it and see if I can keep Father Time&#x27;s effects at bay for a little longer.</li>
            <li> Maybe a little on brown spots and texture</li>
            <li> I use a little with a few drops of water to get the spreadability all over.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave a residue or any unpleasant sticky or oily feeling, and I&#x27;m pretty picky about what goes on my face.</li>
            <li> Add to that that the products are made with no parabens, alcohol, phthalates, sulfates or petrochemicals, artificial fragrances or colors and are never tested on animals, and you have a real winner in skincare.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care for heavy scents that give me a headache.</li>
            <li> but doesnt feel too heavy or greasy on my skin</li>
            <li> Been using it a few days and although I have not observed any change, I look forward to applying it to my face every night (and sometimes during the day).</li>
            <li> I have used both the serum and the moisturizer for a few weeks now</li>
            <li> and I have been using this cream for a few weeks</li>
            <li> So I decided to start using something, and after reading quite a few reviews I ordered Amara&#x27;s product.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t feel heavy or greasy.</li>
            <li> Looking forward to my skin results after a few weeks of use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a traveler, but I know that dry skin is a common complaint on a plane.</li>
            <li> I also use this cream on my neck, elbows, knees and my poor dry flaky feet.</li>
            <li> The skin below the chin were getting thin and loose and it helped it tighten.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to see how I look  in a few months!</li>
            <li> Not sure if it&#x27;ll reverse aging</li>
            <li> The bottle is small and the pump acts up</li>
            <li> My pores are (were) very large and I was very unhappy with them.</li>
            <li> But unfortunately it leaves the skin dry and with sticky feeling to touch.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so hard to find one that doesn&#x27;t leave my face feeling greasy or sticky.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for a few days about 5 and i have noticed that my skin is a lot softer to the tough.</li>
            <li> its a thick cream</li>
            <li> I am not sure that I have witnessed dramatic changes.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer if not so thick that it feels sticky but not so thin that it feels like water.</li>
            <li> and it is even worse in the winter.</li>
            <li> Sadly the dispenser pump arrived without working</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not an unpleasant scent, but I don&#x27;t want something on my face that smells.</li>
            <li> I hate screwing lids on and off, so</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I really like this face cream. In the short time I have had it I have already noticed a difference in the dryness of my skin. My face has a glow to it and no longer has dry spots. The skin feels tighter and I really feel like it&#x27;s working to prevent wrinkles. I am starting now while I am young (33) so I can prevent them before they arrive.</li>
            <li> I really like the way this cream feels on my face. Most Moisturizer creams make my face feel like i have a dirty face or like my skin cant breath. But this cream is very light and easy to apply. I have to be careful with creams on my face because i always brake out. But i have not with this moisturizer. I have been using it for a few days about 5 and i have noticed that my skin is a lot softer to the tough. And my friend asked me if i was using a different cosmetics or something because my skin looked grate. So you know i will keep using Anti Aging Face Cream after that statement LOL</li>
            <li> This is one of three Amara organic products I am currently using. I like the combination of the serum and the moisturizer on my face. I cannot say it has removed any wrinkles but there are not anymore. And that is saying something for a 72 yr old living in a dry climate. The only drawback I will mention is the smell when you first apply the moisturizer Is not as pleasant as some others (non-organic) I have used.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m getting older, my skin is getting drier and I want quick and easy moisture that helps my skin to look and feel younger.  This product is great because it&#x27;s organic and skips the chemicals that make me nervous to put on my face. I also appreciate that it&#x27;s vegan. The lotion is lightweight, but has enough substance to really feel the moisture. It doesn&#x27;t leave a residue or any unpleasant sticky or oily feeling, and I&#x27;m pretty picky about what goes on my face. My only problem with it is the smell is pretty strong. It&#x27;s not an unpleasant scent, but I don&#x27;t want something on my face that smells. As long as you are good with scented products, you will love this moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Love the way this moisturizer feels on my face. I have to use medicated creams on my face as well so it is important that I have a moisturizer that is not greasy when mixed with my medication. This product smells so good, it has a little bit of a rose smell. This moisturizer if not so thick that it feels sticky but not so thin that it feels like water. My foundation wears nicely on top of this product as well. You will love it!!</li>
            <li> I have only been using this for a week and can already feel and see a difference. I have had some &amp;#34;age lines&amp;#34; on my forehead and around the mouth that are feeling tighter and are not quite as defined as they have been. It is a nice moisturizer that you can wear during the day under make up or at night before bed. You only have to use just a small amount to cover your whole face.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer is great!  It goes on so smoothly and dries quickly without being sticky or greasy.  I wish I could use it on my whole body!!  I am sensitive to most facial moisturizers but this one hasn&#x27;t given me any issues!</li>
            <li> This moisturizer is amazing! First off, I LOVE that is is natural and organic.  I feel much safer putting it on my skin.  The smell is nice and not overpowering which is a problem that I have had with other moisturizers in the past.  It goes on smoothly and evenly and my face feels refreshed. It is not sticky or greasy which is another huge plus.  My face looks and feels better already.</li>
            <li> the products feels like it makes my skin dry.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer is great! It&#x27;s so hard to find one that doesn&#x27;t leave my face feeling greasy or sticky. It dries in literally seconds and leaves my face feeling smooth and soft! I love it and will definitely be buying more. Will update when I&#x27;ve been using it for long enough to see results in any fine lines!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately not satisfied with this product - Will probably send back within the next few days!</li>
            <li> Lightweight with lots of good ingredients.  It makes my skin feel great!  I will definitely order again.</li>
            <li> I like this lightweight moisturizer. It helps my skin feel soft but not oily. It has a different smell when you are applying it but it isn&#x27;t offensive by any means. I&#x27;ve been using it two times a day and I still have plenty to use before I have to reorder. I have sensitivity to most skin products but I haven&#x27;t had any reactions so that is a good sign. I will be reordering for sure.</li>
            <li> very nice scent ,not greasy and goes on smooth</li>
            <li> GREAT MOISTURIZER,LAST ALL DAY</li>
            <li> Only been using this for a short period of time, so I&#x27;m unable to comment on any results.  However, I love the all natural ingredients and the way it glides on without leaving me a greasy mess.  I hate screwing lids on and off, so the pump bottle is a very convenient feature.  The wonderful, clean smell is an added plus and an incentive to get moisturized before leaving the house.  Will definitely buy this again.</li>
            <li> Awesome product. New skin for me.</li>
            <li> Love this product! Makes my skin vibrant and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feel. My bottle broke and they offered to replace the whole thing for free!!! Definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> If you have acne prone skin, don&#x27;t use this product. It will clog your pores big time. It smells nice though.</li>
            <li> Great moisturizer! It has a nice light scent and I love the natural ingredients.  It goes on smoothly and absorbs to keep your face soft and moisturized all day. I&#x27;ll buy this again.</li>
            <li> I seem to be doing more Christmas shopping online every year.  I purchased this product for grandma&#x27;s Christmas stocking. I mean, who couldn&#x27;t use a good moisturizer.  I hope she likes it!</li>
            <li> I gave this moisturizer to my 70yr old mother and she loves it. She usually uses olay, which she really can&#x27;t afford. This product works just as well and it&#x27;s half the price. More for your buck and get same or better results.  You can&#x27;t beat that.</li>
            <li> This product works great.  it leaves my skin nice and hydrated and I love that it is natural and organic!  I love the pump top and the product is of good quality.</li>
            <li> Again I do not buy this product, Because it does not work I give three stars Because it feels That Moisturizes the skin, but does not work for lines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I proved it for three months, and it not Eliminates expression lines</li>
            <li> Great lotion. I am using it before applying makeup and feels nice on the skin.</li>
            <li> So far, this moisturizer is amazing. It has my skin feeling quenched without being oily. I have not had any breakouts since i started using this product. I typically have super sensitive skin, so anything new tends to break me out. but this product did not do that to my sensitive skin. The smell is a little interesting. It&#x27;s not super fragrant, but it&#x27;s just not what you&#x27;re probably used to, so keep that in mind. The smell doesn&#x27;t linger on your face, just while you&#x27;re applying.</li>
            <li> What a great product! My skin drinks this moisture in. I put it (usually) after using the hyaluronic acid first and letting it sink in. This moisturizer does not have added fragrances yet, it smells naturally wonderful. I love it and my friends love it now. My skin is much more healthy and wrinkles look diminished as well, yay!!!!!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually write reviews, but really felt compelled to do so with Amara Organics products. I started off with the Vitamin C Serum and once I saw results I was hooked, decided to try more products. I bought this moisturizer in the Anti-Aging Kit and I am really enjoying this product. I love the way it feels on the skin, it absorbs well and has a very pleasant, light rose smell that doesn&#x27;t linger long. My makeup goes on very well on top of this moisturizer. It feels great to be using such a wonderful product on my face. Great customer service as well, very prompt and extremely helpful. Looking forward to trying out more products in the future with this company.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used a product such as this, at 64 I found my neck (creping) was the one thing that made me look and feel old. Since using this product for 4 weeks, I have noticed a definite improvement on my neck and facial lines as they have begun to dissappear.  I can&#x27;t wait to see how I look  in a few months!</li>
            <li> divine, love it makes my skin look fresh and clean</li>
            <li> Very moisturizing.  I live in colorado and battle dry skin.  This works very well for me.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer will be great for the warmer months, but I think I&#x27;m going to need something with more oomph for the winter months. Has a nice scent to it and is really lightweight.</li>
            <li> Very absorbent and non greasy.  Absorbs fast since my job causes me to sweat fast.  Very rich, so I feel I&#x27;m getting a good lather.</li>
            <li> Love this product!  It smells heavenly, feels silky smooth and moisturizing, yet light.  It came fast and I have been using it in the morning and before bed.  Not sure if it&#x27;ll reverse aging, however, it&#x27;s a really great face moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Love the Amara Organics products. I use this as my night time moisturizer - it is very sheer, which I like.</li>
            <li> Love this product! It leaves your face feeling so soft. I&#x27;m excited to see the results in 30 days :)</li>
            <li> I really love this moisturizer. It makes your skin feel very smooth without feeling greasy</li>
            <li> Great product! Best seller EVER! If you want results stop searching! These work AWESOME!</li>
            <li> just received my order. only took 3 days to get.I really like the light cream non-greasy texture and the fragrance. I am thoroughly impressed that I received a personal email from Amara Organics thanking me for the purchase and tips on the optimum usage / application. I&#x27;ve purchased the vitamin C serum previously  and continue to find their products good for my skin with fine results and no allergic reactions.</li>
            <li> Very nice face cream, absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin sticky. It has a slight fragrance, which I wasn&#x27;t too sure if I liked, but it dissipated quickly and I don&#x27;t notice it anymore.</li>
            <li> Has a great fruity smell and feels good on the skin yet light.</li>
            <li> After trying too many creams to remember this past year can say honestly that this does work!My fine lines have nearly disappeared and love everything about it!The company has the best most caring customer service you will find also.Will be buying again!</li>
            <li> Smells good and keeps my face moisturized. The bottle is small and the pump acts up but I just open the lid and pour it out.</li>
            <li> Very nice consistency and great absorption. Definitely makes skin feel softer and more elastic. Gentle for face.</li>
            <li> I am into removing any toxins I can from my family, and so I am interested in natural and organic products.  I was glad to find this face cream, especially since it contained so many of the things I have been learning about.  The argan oil was a big plus for me.  I am fine with aging and the visual effects, but like any woman I want to do what I can to keep my skin healthy and soft.  This is a good product and I am glad to have ordered it.</li>
            <li> I got this for my fiance and she loves it. She says she likes it because it is not too greasy and helps her face feel clean and refreshing. She has used a few different products for face cream and moisturizing, etc... She seems to like the Amara Organics products (I got her the Eye Gel as well - Big Thumbs up for that one too).</li>
            <li> I purchased this mosturizer and the eye gel together.  I love both.  I was in search of an organic mosturizer as I have sensative skin and usually break out when I try new products - I did not with this one.  I don&#x27;t have to use much and I can say that this mosturizer is better than any others I&#x27;ve tried (and I&#x27;ve tried expensive - Clinique and in-expensive, Nutrogena, Oil of Olay, etc.).  It goes on very easily, dries quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave my face feeling oily.  Great product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this moisturizer for about 3 weeks.  I am very happy with it for several reasons.  I especially like that this is a non-greasy feeling product, it seems to absorb really nicely into my skin.  I like the fragrance, has a light, clean scent.  I&#x27;ve used many expensive products over the years and this reasonably priced moisturizer ranks right up there!!</li>
            <li> This organic moisturizer is so luxurious that I feel like I have not used anything, yet my skin is glowing!  I love that I can use this day and night and all around my face and neck for great results!  It has a nice scent and works well!</li>
            <li> This cream feels so rich but not heavy. I am very happy with it. It also has a pleasant natural smell like roses.</li>
            <li> I love this Anti Aging Face Moisturizer Cream. I&#x27;m 63 years old so I am always taking care of my skin. My biggest problem areas are around my eyes, cheeks, forehead and my throat. My skin is very dry with redness around the cheeks. I  can&#x27;t use  any products that have alcohol or chemicals, because that increases the redness in my skin. I love that it is 100% natural and made in the USA, full of vitamins and antioxidants that help my skin feel nourished and radiant, unlike all those department store creams that are full of chemicals and other toxins that are irritating to your skin.  This cream glides softly on my skin without leaving any oily residues. The clever pump only dispenses enough cream that goes a long way. I use it morning and evening together with Amara Eye Gel and the Serum. I also use this cream on my neck, elbows, knees and my poor dry flaky feet. I like the soft scent in the cream. I don&#x27;t care for heavy scents that give me a headache. I have been using this moisturizer for about 2  weeks now and I have noticed less fine lines on my forehead. I can&#x27;t wait to see more great results after one month. Good price! For the price of one over the counter moisturizer, you can buy all three products, moisturizer, serum and eye cream. I received an email with tips on how to use this product which was very helpful. I appreciate the great customer service. I give it 5 stars</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been very happy with this product. I&#x27;ll admit I have forgotten to apply it every morning and night. Even with forgetting it has helped smooth my face and diminish the appearance of my naturally large pores. I use it along with the eye gel, which works great! It doesn&#x27;t feel greasy, and soaks in well leaving my face feeling fresh and hydrated. It smells nice too. The smallest minor I had with the cream was that I wasn&#x27;t too impressed with the container, but the actually cream works great, so that is a very small con.</li>
            <li> I would compare this to a lightweight lotion. It works smoothly into my skin and feels great without any oiliness or greasiness! It does have a light scent, but it smells fruity like it is tied into it&#x27;s ingredients not an added fragrance. This has not irritated my sensitive skin, and my fiancÃ© loves to use it to sooth his skin after shaving.</li>
            <li> Lightweight and absorbs quickly, softening and hydrating the skin.  I noticed a lessening of the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles after use.  It has a very light scent that quickly fades, and love that it is organic and safe for my sensitive skin!  It is lightweight and not heavy like some other facial creams are.</li>
            <li> Nice face cream...... I&#x27;m the guy why wrote reviews on the &amp;#34;Total Eye Gel&amp;#34; and the &amp;#34;Hyaluronic Acid Serum for Skin.&lt;br /&gt;What more can I say, these three products do the trick for my North Texas outdoor face of 59 years lol.&lt;br /&gt;Try one or all, I just know they feel good and work at least on me!&lt;br /&gt;This &amp;#34;Anti Aging Face Cream Moisturizer&amp;#34; is something I will use everytime I hop out of the shower and before bed. This is a big deal to me, It&#x27;s not greasy! I can not stand greasy stuff on my face, and this is not. Sure for the first couple minutes, then is soaks in and I&#x27;m ready for the ranch, or bed......</li>
            <li> Love this organic face lotion!!! So silky smooth!</li>
            <li> I have just started using this product. I am pleased with it.  I started using Amara vitamin C serum and the hyaluronic acid serum and am pleased with those products and decided to try the moisturizer also.  So far I am liking this product also.</li>
            <li> I just received the Anti Aging Face Cream Moisturizer the other day, so I can only comment on the scent and consistency, that is why only 4 stars.  Well, initially I did have to pump it many times for it to start coming out of the pump, but then it did work and comes out nice.  It has a pleasant scent and goes on the skin nicely and does not leave face feeling greasy at all, so far, I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Amazing customer service and a fantastic product. Winning combination!!</li>
            <li> In theory all the ingredients  sound good. But unfortunately it leaves the skin dry and with sticky feeling to touch.&lt;br /&gt;Another thing is vest strong smell which suggest the use of chemicals and alcohols.&lt;br /&gt;Also, be careful,it ll make you break out like crazy.&lt;br /&gt;Maybe it just isn&#x27;t for my skin. Hope it works for everyone else</li>
            <li> Love this moisturizer.  I have only used it for 5 days.  I can already see and feel a difference in my complexion.  Customer service is outstanding.</li>
            <li> Amazing costumer service ... Love the smell of the product .... 1 day try out and it&#x27;s not bad ... I&#x27;ll give another feedback in 2 weeks to keep u guys updated :)</li>
            <li> It feels great going on and wears well under make up</li>
            <li> Great moisturizer. Love the organic ingredients. Really works great with Amara serum. I am&lt;br /&gt;over 65 and this is really helping with youthful glo.</li>
            <li> pleasantly surprised with this product. its a thick cream but doesnt feel too heavy or greasy on my skin (no i dont have super dry skin). it absorbs well. and i started to notice a slight plump in my skin after a week or so of using it.  has a nice scent -i dont like perfumy products and usually get things unscented, but this one has a lovely light rose scent. i&#x27;ll purchase it again.</li>
            <li> Amara Organics face cream is nice and light and can be used for daytime moisture. It isn&#x27;t greasy and goes on well on my face. I like the ingredients are organic because the face is such a delicate area. I cannot attest to any long-term benefits but short-term I have noticed more moisturized skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: this is now my go-to moisturizer and since writing this review my skin feels so much more smooth. I love it. It&#x27;s taking the place of the cerave cream I used to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product at a discount for my unbiased review.</li>
            <li> Smells wonderful!  Been using it a few days and although I have not observed any change, I look forward to applying it to my face every night (and sometimes during the day).</li>
            <li> Very happy with this moisturizer, not heavy or greasy. I like the light lotion, and how it absorbs quickly. It has a very gentle scent, will not interfere with perfume or makeup. Very satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> So far so AWESOME! I have this, the serum, and the eye gel. They rock my socks. My face feels younger and fresher than it has in 10 years. There is no residue, my make up goes on perfect afterwards without feeling weighed down. So far no breakouts or sensitivity issues. I feel like this would be a gentle and organic option for so many.  The bottle is a great size and I feel like it will last me a good while even with daily use.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this moisturizer! It has a light, pleasant scent. It absorbs quickly into my skin. It&#x27;s not greasy or sticky. I use it with conjunction with some of the other Amara Organics products. In addition to my face, I have been applying it to the back of one of my hands and that&#x27;s where I have been seeing the biggest difference. After applying it, the skin cells &amp; pores look so much smaller. The skin on that hand is so soft. My left hand looks much younger than my right one. Now that I&#x27;ve seen the results, I will now use it on my other hand so they both look younger! Seeing the results on my hand make me confidant that I&#x27;m getting the same results on my facial skin.</li>
            <li> Turned 31 and realized eeekkk I need some help fighting these darn fine line and wrinkles! I&#x27;m happy to use this one b/c I know it&#x27;s safe and natural and feels great on my skin. Lightweight and not greasy.</li>
            <li> I have added this moisturizer to my daily routine and LOVE it. I have somewhat sensitive skin and it is even worse in the winter. This cream is soothing, moisturizing and doesn&#x27;t leave me greasy. I didn&#x27;t even know it until it arrived, but Amara is a local company to me and made right in my home town! I would absolutely recommend this product and will continue to purchase this anti aging moisturizer from Amara. I am excited to try the other products in their line.</li>
            <li> I have only been using this product for about two weeks, but so far, I am really impressed with it. While I know that at my age (60&#x27;s) there aren&#x27;t going to be any miracles, I have noticed improvement in the texture of my skin and it is also brighter than before. It is very smooth and silky to apply, and one thing I like about the bottle is that one pump doesn&#x27;t give out too much so waste is avoided. I am using this with the Amara Organics Vitamin C serum, ad I strongly believe that using both products together has aided in my skin&#x27;s improvement. Plus, the price of many single items is more than both of these together. Add to that that the products are made with no parabens, alcohol, phthalates, sulfates or petrochemicals, artificial fragrances or colors and are never tested on animals, and you have a real winner in skincare.</li>
            <li> My usually dry, dry, dry skin is looking great! This cream does a great job of moisturizing my skin without being greasy or making my skin shiny or oily. I also use it on my hands and I can&#x27;t believe how much better they look. All the gross, dry cracks are gone. My skin is so soft and healthy looking. I love that it&#x27;s paraben and chemical free. I also really appreciate the addition of vitamins in the formula. This works much better than my old moisturizer and it costs less!</li>
            <li> I love this line of products!  This is a great moisturizer to use on a daily basis.  It makes my skin feel great and I feel like its glowing.  I use it in combination with the companies other products and feel that my fine lines are fading.  The product shipped fast and I received within days.  I had an issue with my first bottle and the customer service was great and got a new bottle out to me asap.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this on my hands for a couple of weeks now and it is definitely working.  They look and feel much softer.  The pump dispenses a very small amount of lotion and it only takes four pumps for both hands.  I only use it once daily, at night just before I go to bed.  The smell is very soft and not overpowering.</li>
            <li> This product doesn&#x27;t disappoint. It is a light cream that doesn&#x27;t sit heavily on my skin but absorbs directly without an oily feeling. I donâ€™t want to walk around feeling like I have a mask on my face and this moisturizer is like wearing nothing at all. It has a pleasant scent that dissipates quickly, so it does not interfere with my perfume when I apply it under my makeup before going out for the day. The thing I have found as I am aging, is that the skin on my face is getting drier with every year that passes. The revitalizing agents in this product already seem to be replenishing the moisture that time has stripped away. I especially notice a difference in the way my skin looks after applying my foundation. It appears smoother and my pores are not as evident as they used to be. The bottle dispenser has a convenient pump with small opening which I like so it does not give out too much at a time and the size is good for my hand.</li>
            <li> This is an all natural moisturizer that does just what it - softens, hydrates, and repairs skin. It has nourishing vitamins and and anti-oxidants that work well in the dry winter heat. My skin just soaks it up.  I&#x27;m not a traveler, but I know that dry skin is a common complaint on a plane. I would recommend using this pre- and post-flight. It is lightweight and non-greasy and has no alcohol to dry out your skin. It doesn&#x27;t weigh down the skin or clog pores. It has a pleasant fragrance and it is easy on my sensitive skin. I use it on my face and hands with visible results!</li>
            <li> I have used both the serum and the moisturizer for a few weeks now and I seemed to not have any problem that I used to have when I switched products. Hopefully my skin will remain clear.  I especially like the very gentle feeling of both products when applied to my skin.  I read online that the smell from this product bothers some people but it doesn&#x27;t really bother me.  I use both serum and moisturizer on my neck and my hands.  I will keep on using these products and may recommend them to my friends.</li>
            <li> This face lotion is so light and delicious. I would lick it off of myself but I have a feeling that wouldn&#x27;t be helpful for my skin and probably wouldn&#x27;t taste very nice. :)&lt;br /&gt;But I love the light floral scent and it&#x27;s sheer enough that makeup goes over it easily. I feel like my skin looks a lot better in the past month of using it because it keeps me hydrated like a morning dewy rain. Ah! I am using it morning and at night and I will definitely be reordering.</li>
            <li> I so love this product. It doesn&#x27;t make my face oily...</li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer! I really prefer using organic products with no animal testing and this fits the bill. It&#x27;s an added bonus that it&#x27;s made here in the USA. This cream really absorbs quickly with no residue and leaves my skin feeling amazing. There&#x27;s no heavy smell - which is a problem for me with a lot of products. So far I&#x27;ve had no reactions either. I really recommend this moisturizer!</li>
            <li> I have been using Amara products for a couple of weeks now.  I like them all.  They are quick drying and very moisturizing.  I have sensitive skin and have had no problems.  I woudl recommend them to anyone.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using for a couple of weeks now and it is working, Iâ€™m using the serum and the eye gel together.  There is no residue and my makeup goes on perfect without feeling weighed down.  I love that it is natural and organic and doesnâ€™t have a heavy smell. the pump top is great and the packaging is nice and simple.  Would recommend</li>
            <li> I am a huge fan of the Amara Organics brand and this a an excellent basic moisturizer, good for every day use, that has all of the good stuff in it that is healthy for your skin and excellent anti-aging ingredients --- Peptides, Vitamins B3 &amp; E, Resveratrol, and Fruit Stem Cells, among the excellent, high grade, natural ingredients.  I am new to the idea of fruit cell science for anti aging products  but leaning towards thinking it is a good thing because this cream is sweet on the face.  What I noticed the most, after using it for over a month, is that it evened out my skin tone and helped with redness.  I use 3 Amara products every day so it may be the combination of the 3 but I would certainly use the moisturizer alone, with a sunscreen for day and as a night cream too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Back to the main ingredient, Fruit Stem Cells.  The idea is that by stimulating aging skin stem cells, this plant extract has been shown to lessen the appearance of unsightly wrinkles.  Clinical trials show that this unique formulation increases the longevity of skin cells, resulting in skin that has a more youthful and radiant appearance.  And, in those same trials, it was shown to have reversed sun damaged skin too.  I have to say I agree.  My skin has improved immensely overall.  No more redness and the couple of fairly light spots I had are gone.  Could be the other ingredients or the Fruit Stem Cells.  You&#x27;ll have to decide for yourself but the price is good, so worth giving it a try.</li>
            <li> I like it!  My skin is pretty sensitive and oily yet feels very dry..  This has done a good job on making my skin feel moisturized.</li>
            <li> This product along with their retinol serum, vitamin C serum and eye gel have been a great switch for me.  My skin looks great, the ingredients are all natural and the price is more reasonable than what I was formerly using.  I will be looking forward to any new products they add to their line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Follow up-the longer I use these products the better results, my skin really looks and feels great.</li>
            <li> I ordered this because I wanted something that I thought would be gentle for super sensitive adult acne prone skin.  So far, absolutely no new breakouts and the old breakouts are actually healing.  The moisturizer is creamy and easily glides onto my skin without any greasy feeling.  It has a light, pleasant scent that smells great-without competing with perfume or body lotion.  I have noticed that my face is feeling a bit more elastic and &amp;#34;fuller&amp;#34;.  I think the fine lines around my ears are disappearing and my skin is slowing getting clearer.  I will definitely order this again!</li>
            <li> I was so excited to get this and a few more products from this line in. I grew up in a beach area and have NOT taken very good care of my skin. My pores are (were) very large and I was very unhappy with them. This moisturizer has made a world of difference. I combined it with the Hyaluronic Acid Serum and the Total Repair Eye gel and the changes have been awesome! My pores are waaaaaay less noticeable and my skin feels amazing! I have not changed anything but the use of these products and I have been getting soo many comments and compliments about the quality of my skin, that I have a glow, that my face looks great- it has been wonderful! It is smooth and lightwieght- no heavy greasy feeling! It works beautifully as a foundation of sorts for my makeup and there is little to no scent. I layer this with the other products and this is the last thing I apply and I feel so good and clean and bright when it is all on!! Awesome moisturizer!</li>
            <li> Has 6 anti-aging ingredients for cell renewal, combining fruit stem cells, peptide, argan oil, hyaluronic acid, resveratrol and vitamins.&lt;br /&gt;â€“ My experience: I was most hesitant to try this one, as Iâ€™ve just had better lucks with serums and gels compared to creams. Regardless of the type of cream or lotion, they often clog my pores and make me feel like taking a shower and washing it all off. Probably due to its pure and organic ingredients this cream is completely different, it makes my skin feel like itâ€™s breathing better and like the others is tackling problems such as wrinkles or dry skin. This one is especially great for long-term preventative care against free radicals.</li>
            <li> I LOVE the new face lotion, I love that it is organic and there are only high quality ingredients. I have been using it for about a week now and it keeps my face soft but doesn&#x27;t cause any breakouts :) I have sensitive skin, dry in patches, somewhat oily in others. Also, the price point was good too! I would definitely be interested in purchasing more products from this company.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer works for me very well. I have a sensitive acne-prone skin and have bought many different moisturizers that unfortunately gave me breakouts. I use this along with Amara Vitamin C facial serum &amp; Eye Gel during the day and Epiduo before bed at night. It is lightweight, absorbs quickly and thankfully hasn&#x27;t given any bad reaction on my face.</li>
            <li> fast delivery great transacton</li>
            <li> Lightweight, non-greasy moisturizer. I&#x27;ve been using it morning and night and love it. My skin feels fresh and healthy. Great value and great customer service.</li>
            <li> Experienced some breakouts at first, but maybe my skin had to get used to it. It smells good but a bit sharp. It feels a bit sticky at first, but it gets absorbed fast enough. I use it around my eyes too and it doesn&#x27;t sting. It&#x27;s been about three weeks and I see some improvement with the wrinkles on the face. Most surprisingly it improved my neck skin tremendously. The skin below the chin were getting thin and loose and it helped it tighten. And also I had deep lines across my neck since my 20&#x27;s and they got lighter noticeably. I started using this product with Hyaluronic Acid Serum around the same time. It keeps my skin hydrated and not greasy. Great customer service.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 43 and I have been using this cream for a few weeks and I can certainly tell that the skin on my face looks way better. I has gotten rid of the dark circles under my eyes and my face feels tighter. I use it every morning and sometimes also at night. I definitely recommend it. I wish I would have taken a before and after photo to post them here. It&#x27;s a little pricey but I think its worth it.</li>
            <li> Who the heck is giving this 5 stars?  This did NOTHING for my dry skin. NOTHING. Except kept me from putting a real moisturizer on. Plus, one or all of these Amara Organics products -- the eye gel and the Hyaluronic Serum -- made my face break out... which never happens. Returning them all ASAP.</li>
            <li> Okay, there is a different smell with this lotion which I understand is due to the natural ingredients. Getting past the unique smell, it does glide on smoothly and seem to moisturize my skin. I am not sure that I have witnessed dramatic changes. I am in week 3 so, maybe the jury is still out?</li>
            <li> I am definitely going to stick to this one. its light. it feels great on my skin. will continue buying. great customer service also</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 48 year old man who has always had the benefit of my mother&#x27;s genes (she is 73 and looks more like late 50s), but I cannot continue to rely on that. And the wrinkles are definitely creeping in. So I decided to start using something, and after reading quite a few reviews I ordered Amara&#x27;s product. Now I&#x27;m not saying I have seen a drastic change...yet, but I am happy with this product so far. It doesn&#x27;t feel heavy or greasy. It feels like I am doing something good for my skin. Will continue to use it and see if I can keep Father Time&#x27;s effects at bay for a little longer.</li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer.  It makes my face feel firm and smooth</li>
            <li> LOVE the smell, which has a nice essence of rose. Very spa-like. I use a little with a few drops of water to get the spreadability all over. Sadly the dispenser pump arrived without working so I just unscrew the top and get a dab out that way. No biggie. Feels great on the face and no negative skin reaction. I use it AM and PM. Absorbs well and fast. Very pleased and will purchase again. This is coming from someone who has been on the hunt for &amp;#34;that perfect face cream&amp;#34; and I flitter from product to product trying to find the right one. I think this may just be &amp;#34;it&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I use this in conjunction with the Hyaluronic acid serum and my face feels better than it ever has.  I suffer from dry dry dry skin on my face, and the combination of these two products are the ONLY thing that I&#x27;ve tried (and I&#x27;ve tried a lot) that work for me.  I&#x27;m a lifetime customer now.</li>
            <li> I use this during the day instead of the vitamin c cream. My face is  oily and this works perfect.  I waited to write this review to see if it really works. It does. I am so pleasantly surprised. The lines on my forehead, lips, and eyes are really minimizing.</li>
            <li> without any desire to return these creams because the quality is excellent I just mentioned that the pump did not work, the company contacted me and  replaced them withing a week. I was really impressed by their service and care for their product which I repeat is excellent</li>
            <li> OK but fragrance was problem.</li>
            <li> Great product! I am really happy with the result, recommended.</li>
            <li> This is my most favorite wrinkle cream/moisturizer ever!. I use the vitamin C serum from them, then use this on top of that, and my skin has never felt better. I am in my mid 50&#x27;s and love the sun, and I&#x27;m  really impressed with how great my skin feels and looks. I will definitely keep buying these products from this company.</li>
            <li> I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amara Organics Advanced Age-Defying Moisturizer is a cell renewal formula with anti aging ingredients which is why I wanted to give it a try.  I like that it is a light weight, non-greasy formula and has a very pleasant light scent.  It absorbs quickly into my skin, contains 100% natural - 85% organic ingredients and is made in the USA.  This product comes with a 365 day money back guarantee, and is never tested on animals.  This is a moisturizer that makes my skin feel good and has ingredients without the added parabens and alcohol.  I am using this in the mornings and at night as directed after cleansing and toning.  This product has a pump dispenser so it is easy to dispense just the amount I need, so it will last me for a while.  Very pleased with this product as I can easily apply my makeup over it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always looking for new skin cream that will prevent or keep wrinkles at bay.  I haven&#x27;t found one yet that I love so I thought I&#x27;d give this brand a try.  I also purchased their eye cream too.  Looking forward to my skin results after a few weeks of use.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this moisturizer. I use this in combination with the serum and eye cream. As a group, they really work well together. The smell of the moisturizer reminds me to being in the spa getting a facial. It is very subtle and pleasant. I do find that I need a little more than one pump of this to evenly cover my skin, but I would rather be over moisturized than dry. I use this in the morning, and at night. I live in a very dry climate, and when I use this, I do not wake up feeling like my skin is dehydrated, I feel fresh. If I miss a night, I can tell in the morning. When I get low, I will be ordering more right away. Very happy with this product line.</li>
            <li> Used one bottle and will probably buy more. It&#x27;s 2.4 oz of the best ingredients for $24? Dollars.Only used one month , I put it on neck and face, so hard to tell if there&#x27;s results. Maybe a little on brown spots and texture alittle better.</li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer. It doesn&#x27;t clog my pores or leave my skin feeling greasy. It takes about a minute to absorb, but once it does, my skin is super soft and hydrated. I  love the smell, itâ€™s light and pleasant, not too overpowering. I&#x27;m happy with my results so far.</li>
