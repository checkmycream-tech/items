            <li> Great product. Prescribed by my optometrist for dry eyes.</li>
            <li> My eye doctor told me to take these.  They are pretty good.</li>
            <li> Works as presented, though a bit pricey for what you get.</li>
            <li> Recommended by my eye doctor for use with reading glasses. The price is crazy [just not as crazy as trying to buy it in a CVS] being that the main ingredient it basically water and antifreeze (yes, you read that correctly, don&#x27;t ingest it). That said, it makes my eyes nice and lubed and very comfortable. Literally your most important body parts, your eyes don&#x27;t get much love, so treat them to a nice drop of this and you&#x27;ll be happy you did.</li>
            <li> good product, recommended by doctor</li>
            <li> delivery and product seem fine.</li>
            <li> The eye drops were recommended to me by my optometrist after I mentioned that my eyes felt dry and itched.  He gave me a sample and I had immediate long lasting relief.  I ordered the drops and they were delivered as promised and are doing the job.  I will reorder when I need more.</li>
            <li> These drops recommended by my Optomotrist over other brands for people like me, light eyes, living in a dry environment.  Lubricates &amp; soothes tired dry eyes; although it does not take the red away, nor is it engineered to do that.</li>
            <li> Not as good as Genteel Severe for my eyes</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Systane for years, both Balance and Ultra. I like both of them.</li>
            <li> Great product. Comes recommended by the doctor, and half the price of Target.</li>

            <li> I bought this brand of eye lubricant at the recommendation of my ophthalmologist during my most recent exam where it indicated that I am not producing enough tear drops to satisfy the needs of my eyes.  He gave me a sample and indicated it is the brand that he personally uses.  I imagine benefits will take a while to show up.  Meanwhile I feel comfortable using this product at his recommendation because he is an internationally renown eye surgeon.</li>
            <li> Just as advertised. Will buy again</li>
            <li> My eye doctor recommended these to me because I was having trouble with my eyes being so watery and leaking all the time. People thought I was crying, it was not cool.
