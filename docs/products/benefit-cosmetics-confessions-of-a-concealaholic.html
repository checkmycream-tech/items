    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>But the fact you can mix the two colors to match your skin tone is excellent.</li>
            <li>The concealers are the best!</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t Stray which btw is the best concealer on the market and matches my skin winter and summer)</li>
            <li>Its the best product I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>Benefit has the best line of products.</li>

            <li>The product is awesome.  </li>
            <li>This is some of the best concealer I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
            <li>will order again  great produst!!!</li>
            <li>This make up is a very good makeup</li>
            <li>Every cream is very good quality, and covers well.</li>
            <li>If they did change their name, I don&#x27;t think it was a good idea, and now the confusion and price changes have me looking for alternatives!</li>
            <li>The medium is working great for my neutral medium skintone.</li>
            <li>you can sample all the products for a great price.  </li>
            <li>That Gal works great.  </li>
            <li>Still an over all great set.</li>
            <li>For those who do not have any signs of aging under the eyes, this is a GREAT kit.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s great for touch ups on the car.</li>
            <li>The concealer worked great under the eyes.</li>
            <li>SO what i love to do!!</li>
            <li>it IS a really great box to own, substantial-wise and the products are great..</li>
            <li>bright:</li>
            <li>The lemon aide is a good product</li>
            <li>Good value for your money.</li>
            <li>I have olive skin and maybe this set is for fair skinned ladies.</li>
            <li>Benefit products are for teenagers with exceptional skin, period.</li>
            <li>- I would highly recommend this to anyone who loves great coverage because Benefits provides a flawless complexion with this kit.</li>
            <li>Erase paste is a very potent concealer: the color matches my skin color</li>
            <li>Love the way they all work together comes with great instructions that include explanations on what each product does and how to use it.</li>
            <li>this seemed like a much better deal!</li>
            <li>gal primer - I love this!</li>
            <li>but i will just be sure NEVER TO BUY FROM HERE EVER AGAIN!</li>
            <li>And I love the products in it too!  </li>
            <li>I got to try all the products and see if I liked them.</li>
            <li>Lemon aid is also vey good: better as a lid color corrector than as a primer, though.</li>
            <li>They all work good although after using it as directed, i wasnt completely satisfied, so then i just tried using the products my way as i saw fit, and i liked the results much better.  </li>
            <li>This little set is perfect for home use and a great deal....</li>
            <li>makes my face look awake and healthy by making the eyelid color even and nice and healthy looking.    </li>
            <li>and I usually love all the makeup I buy from them.</li>
            <li>but I already knew most of the product before I bought</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m glad I bought it.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>I never review products on Amazon, but I absolutely love this thing.</li>
            <li>I think that the best product of this kit is the erase paste, I&#x27;m going to buy it later separately.</li>
            <li>This comes with a lot of product, almost more than you can use.</li>
            <li>but i will eventually use most of it</li>
            <li>im sure.</li>
            <li>The Boing concealer is a bit oily, or more oily than i&#x27;m used to...</li>
            <li>I find the paste to be off even more in tone making it even more unuseable for some.</li>
            <li>Its just ok.    </li>
            <li>This product makes the no-makeup-look look better.</li>
            <li>found some products I Love and some I can do without</li>
            <li>I love it when Benefit has kits like this...</li>
            <li>That Gal face primer is ok</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cute packaging</li>
            <li>The longer you wear it though, the more it tends to settle in your creases.</li>
            <li>The erase paste is my favorite.</li>
            <li>so, let me start off by saying i LOVE benefit make-up.</li>
            <li>but, for a non-discounted item +shipping costs, i am SURE they wouldn&#x27;t skimp..</li>
            <li>But, for those that do have some under eye lines, the products do settle into the wrinkles and make them appear even more.</li>
            <li>Arrived in time - the packaging is adorable.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s magic.  </li>
            <li>I did say ok to the credit</li>
            <li>Ok, maybe some of you can help me out...</li>
            <li>so why is it $30 more now?</li>
            <li>I usually love Benefit products.  </li>
            <li>I love love love this.</li>
            <li>This is magic in a box.</li>
            <li>they sure seem more noticable.</li>
            <li>nothing better.</li>
            <li>I was able to detect it as soon as I saw it.&lt;br /&gt;Beware when you purchase this product.</li>
            <li>IT comes in a cute box.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m OCD and it&#x27;s really nice to have a tint/base, 2 colors of concealer, special undereye concealer, eye brightener, and color corrector (</li>
            <li>Their products are pretty pricey, so this little case was a great bargin that came with many of their best products.</li>
            <li>Bright - I don&#x27;t really get the point of this one.</li>
            <li>&quot; stuff didnt make too much difference, but it is still a good primer...pleasant smell.</li>
            <li>But other then that the rest of the product is awesome.</li>
            <li>but the fact that it could break so easily makes me not want to buy this product</li>
            <li>sizes of products makes it easy to try a lot of Benefit&#x27;s concealer line&lt;br /&gt;-Cute</li>
            <li>The mirror breaks really easily</li>
            <li>u can easily over do it.</li>
            <li>paste - best for dark circles.</li>
            <li>You may be better off buying it at full price at the store or the brands website.</li>
            <li>The face primer turned out to be the thing I didn&#x27;t really want, but my favorite!</li>
            <li>i will barely be beginning to learn to perfect the look and this new product into my regime by the time it runs out!</li>
            <li>I think this is an awesome little case.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a huge Benefit fan</li>
            <li>I AM HUGE FAN OF BENIFIT AN</li>
            <li>BTW I bought it when it use to be $36 with free shipping.</li>
            <li>: I wear a light purple eye shadow from Clinique that always used to fade before the afternoon.</li>
            <li>I think that this is a great package for traveling with especially if you are a concealaholic!</li>
            <li>It is a good product overall, but the price, maybe not so much, but like ive read what others say, it is a really good way to try all the products and then decide which ones youd buy at full price.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it, I fell in love with it immediately.</li>
            <li>Never disappointed with benefit.</li>
            <li>i was willing to pay more if it would work, but all i get is layer upon layer of stuff, which seems to cake up.</li>
            <li>WAS SO EXCITED TO GET THIS.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to purchase this product.</li>
            <li>Eye bright is the only product I wouldn&#x27;t buy again (and again just cos</li>
            <li>So the only thing I won&#x27;t buy from the kit is the Eye Bright.</li>
            <li>bright - this is the only one that didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll discover that some work and some don&#x27;t, but without paying full price.  </li>
            <li>When I run out, I plan on buying the full sized products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I did buy this, though, because now I know I won&#x27;t be buying Benefit conceal products and wasting my money when I realize they don&#x27;t really work.&lt;br</li>
            <li>i&#x27;ve tried so many combinations but have never found any that will really do the trick.</li>
            <li>This is a great buy due to the price, the quality and by allowing you to expore the brand.     </li>
            <li>The packaging is cute and clever and you get plenty of each product.</li>
            <li>YEAH, SUPER GLUE.</li>
            <li>because breaking out the super glue on something i JUST BOUGHT IS</li>
            <li>This kit is great for a sample kit of all of their products that help with dark circles under your eyes.</li>
            <li>Its definitely a great value for when you want to try out new makeup without spending the extra cash for each one separately.</li>
            <li>I loved the concept of this conceal box, but it isn&#x27;t very effective; it&#x27;s apparent now that I was more drawn to the flashy marketing.</li>
            <li>Well, the real that gal primer smells fruity and light.</li>
            <li>Benefit cosmetics make a consistently great product IF you are 15 and want to cover up, say, a bruise you aquired while rubbing a wildflower too harshly against your face.</li>
            <li>This definitely comes in handy for those cases.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Overall i liked the idea of the kit</li>
            <li>It has a useful guide that I use every time I try to conceal.</li>
            <li>HOWEVER, it did come right from</li>
            <li>it arrived fine, looks new</li>
            <li>It is interesting and elegant, but it&#x27;s not great functionally - there is much better concealer out there.</li>
            <li>it works but it could be better with I little more smoother result.</li>
            <li>I love this cute little set.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad that they offered a sampler in a cute little case like this.  </li>
            <li>Benefit&#x27;s concealer is actually really nice - it helps to even out skin tone and is pretty long lasting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The real one has soft bristles that are able to be cleaned without a problem.</li>
            <li>so all in all, cute box, cute products, waste of money.</li>
            <li>Most of it didn&#x27;t work, and there were some serious creasing problems, which is kind of embarrassing if your goal is a no-makeup makeup look.</li>
            <li>At first I didn&#x27;t see the point, but need a 5 min face?</li>
            <li>u just have to set it in with your favorite pressed powder so it last all day!</li>
            <li>but if I had to purchase this again I would only purchase my favorite products separately when I run out..</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think however that it would be enough for many applications.  </li>
            <li>so if you are wanting to travel with only one or two things you might not be able to.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s gone so fast!</li>
            <li>it was time to refresh my smudge pots, and a friend told me i should do it here, since some colors (not the popular ones, like black, bronze, etc) are discounted (she was right, so i took advantage).</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super light in consistency, goes on smoothly, but doesn&#x27;t stay, and creases after just a few</li>
            <li>almost 3-D like in the photo you are shown above, or really even more than HALF-way, as it shows in the photo.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t even think anyone else would notice it, just me :) Small price to pay for a great concealer for dark circles.</li>
            <li>but i would HIGHLY recommend buying from a reputable source, and NOT from here, especially..</li>
            <li>, you certainly get what you pay for...</li>
            <li>I bought this mainly because I never tried these products and didn&#x27;t want to spend a lot of money on something I couldn&#x27;t try first.  </li>
            <li>: I got a huge zit on my forehead, and boi-ing made it instantly invisible.</li>
            <li>If this item hasn&#x27;t been working for you, do not worry about it because it may not be real...</li>
            <li>living in the real world.</li>
            <li>And really, how can one even put a price on that?</li>
            <li>so i got REALLY screwed...)</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t seem to do much of anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really work for me...</li>
            <li>My face looks so much fresher when I use this.</li>
            <li>It will help you determine if yours is real</li>
            <li>These concealers are designed to appeal to and meet the needs of yonger people who want trendy brightness, not medium to heavy coverage.</li>
            <li>Other than being gipped on actual product, the brushes themselves looked/felt greasy, so those will be getting a good dousing of eye make-up remover and washed well before ANY use..</li>
            <li>it works ok, but so does revlon and other cheaper stuff from the drugstore.</li>
            <li>I have read a bunch of reviews for the items that are included in this kit and it was great to be able to get the kit and try the items out (without having to spend a lot of money on full-sizes and then be disappointed).  </li>
            <li>Erase Paste is nice, but does not cover the natural dark circles.</li>
            <li>They go on very creamy and the product quality is high.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Erase Paste: Again, this is most helpful when it comes to those dark</li>
            <li>and depending on how often you plan to use the regime of cream concealer, eyelid primer, under-eye brightener, etc etc, it is probably only about a 3 month supply when FULL.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a really good amount of the erase paste, and you only need a little at a time anyway.</li>
            <li>These products do nothing for people who are either 1) older than 20 or 2)</li>
            <li>i&#x27;ve had them forever and now that i&#x27;m getting older</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this for others of my skin tone and type.</li>
            <li>I like to little box that has a cute mirror.</li>
            <li>It covers at first, but certainly does not last all day, and I even used Smashbox primer before</li>
            <li>But the combinbation of these products make me look refreshed, young, awake and vibrant!</li>
            <li>This would make for a great bridesmaid gift or a gift in general, but it&#x27;s very small quantity for the price!</li>
            <li>i was so excited to receive this product after reading so many good reviews about boi-ing, lemon-aid and erase paste for covering my seriously ugly dark circles under my eyes.</li>
            <li>you can just bring it right back, used or unused, and they will swap it for you and make it right.&lt;br</li>
            <li>new and got samples with my purchase.</li>
            <li>it is a good thing i noticed it, and that it COULD be glued, or this would be a MUCH less informative and a much more angry review.. which i think i should be pissed off, anyway.</li>
            <li>I love this little case!  </li>
            <li>first mistake was trying a new (to me) product, and not going through Sephora.com or benefit.com, or just an actual brick-and-mortar store first, since i only had reviews and seller ratings to rely on and, knowing i wanted/needed the item anyway for my kit (i am a freelance MUA)</li>
            <li>/&gt;Lemon-aid was my favorite and really made my eyes pop - but it also had a serious creasing problem.</li>
            <li>The sample sizes of these do not bother me, as they are such a good quality only a small bit is needed.</li>
            <li>to super glue it back together, or rip off the entire cover/mirror...</li>
            <li>the eye bright is useless, as is that gal.</li>
            <li>it felt like it melted away with the natural oil in my skin.</li>
            <li>This set is really good, but sadly, does not include the Holy Grail concealer I have been seeking.   </li>
            <li>i&#x27;ve tried this cute little box of goodies every which way to sunday and nothing is working to really cover my dark circles.</li>
            <li>However, it is good for when you have dark circles under your eyes after that late night of partying and you need to look alive for work.</li>
            <li>The booings are better for other parts of the face other than under the eyes because they are not so blendable.</li>
            <li>If I were to buy that only it would be the same price as this whole set!</li>
            <li>I already bought the full size Erase Paste (my miracle secret weapon since I have the most dreaded dark circles) and the That Gal primer.</li>
            <li>I would get much more, but since only a very small amount is needed</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not for everyone, I have a medium to light complexion, acne-free but slightly blotchy and dry skin.</li>
            <li>This is actually an amazing product, however, the sellers on Amazon are selling fake items.</li>
            <li>I did not like this and don&#x27;t care for benefit products in general.</li>
            <li>I would reccommend this to anyone who wants to fake a full 8 hours rest and have skin that glows like a teenagers!</li>
            <li>but i will be SURE to restock it BEFORE i run out, at Sephora where i should and always should get my make-up and tools, because if you open up your box to a bunch of half-packed trays of make-up (which are very small to begin with, this is ONLY a sample-sizes kit!</li>
            <li>I did get a $5.00 credit but the part of this makeup kit is the important part it was discolored and hard as a rock!</li>
            <li>and finally the eye bright was the least of my favorites it was just too chalky and dry and hard to apply.</li>
            <li>The darker one is a lot darker and the lighter one is a little lighter then the real one.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Love the way they all work together comes with great instructions that include explanations on what each product does and how to use it.</li>
            <li> this seemed like a much better deal!</li>
            <li> gal primer - I love this!</li>
            <li> but i will just be sure NEVER TO BUY FROM HERE EVER AGAIN!</li>
            <li> And I love the products in it too!  </li>
            <li> I got to try all the products and see if I liked them.</li>
            <li> Lemon aid is also vey good: better as a lid color corrector than as a primer, though.</li>
            <li> They all work good although after using it as directed, i wasnt completely satisfied, so then i just tried using the products my way as i saw fit, and i liked the results much better.  </li>
            <li> This little set is perfect for home use and a great deal....</li>
            <li> makes my face look awake and healthy by making the eyelid color even and nice and healthy looking.    </li>
            <li> and I usually love all the makeup I buy from them.</li>
            <li> but I already knew most of the product before I bought</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m glad I bought it.</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> I never review products on Amazon, but I absolutely love this thing.</li>
            <li> I think that the best product of this kit is the erase paste, I&#x27;m going to buy it later separately.</li>
            <li> This comes with a lot of product, almost more than you can use.</li>
            <li> but i will eventually use most of it</li>
            <li> im sure.</li>
            <li> The Boing concealer is a bit oily, or more oily than i&#x27;m used to...</li>
            <li> I find the paste to be off even more in tone making it even more unuseable for some.</li>
            <li> Its just ok.    </li>
            <li> This product makes the no-makeup-look look better.</li>
            <li> found some products I Love and some I can do without</li>
            <li> I love it when Benefit has kits like this...</li>
            <li> That Gal face primer is ok</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cute packaging</li>
            <li> The longer you wear it though, the more it tends to settle in your creases.</li>
            <li> The erase paste is my favorite.</li>
            <li> so, let me start off by saying i LOVE benefit make-up.</li>
            <li> but, for a non-discounted item +shipping costs, i am SURE they wouldn&#x27;t skimp..</li>
            <li> But, for those that do have some under eye lines, the products do settle into the wrinkles and make them appear even more.</li>
            <li> Arrived in time - the packaging is adorable.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s magic.  </li>
            <li> I did say ok to the credit</li>
            <li> Ok, maybe some of you can help me out...</li>
            <li> so why is it $30 more now?</li>
            <li> I usually love Benefit products.  </li>
            <li> I love love love this.</li>
            <li> This is magic in a box.</li>
            <li> they sure seem more noticable.</li>
            <li> nothing better.</li>
            <li> I was able to detect it as soon as I saw it.&lt;br /&gt;Beware when you purchase this product.</li>
            <li> IT comes in a cute box.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m OCD and it&#x27;s really nice to have a tint/base, 2 colors of concealer, special undereye concealer, eye brightener, and color corrector (</li>
            <li> Their products are pretty pricey, so this little case was a great bargin that came with many of their best products.</li>
            <li> Bright - I don&#x27;t really get the point of this one.</li>
            <li> &quot; stuff didnt make too much difference, but it is still a good primer...pleasant smell.</li>
            <li> But other then that the rest of the product is awesome.</li>
            <li> but the fact that it could break so easily makes me not want to buy this product</li>
            <li> sizes of products makes it easy to try a lot of Benefit&#x27;s concealer line&lt;br /&gt;-Cute</li>
            <li> The mirror breaks really easily</li>
            <li> u can easily over do it.</li>
            <li> paste - best for dark circles.</li>
            <li> You may be better off buying it at full price at the store or the brands website.</li>
            <li> The face primer turned out to be the thing I didn&#x27;t really want, but my favorite!</li>
            <li> i will barely be beginning to learn to perfect the look and this new product into my regime by the time it runs out!</li>
            <li> I think this is an awesome little case.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a huge Benefit fan</li>
            <li> I AM HUGE FAN OF BENIFIT AN</li>
            <li> BTW I bought it when it use to be $36 with free shipping.</li>
            <li> : I wear a light purple eye shadow from Clinique that always used to fade before the afternoon.</li>
            <li> I think that this is a great package for traveling with especially if you are a concealaholic!</li>
            <li> It is a good product overall, but the price, maybe not so much, but like ive read what others say, it is a really good way to try all the products and then decide which ones youd buy at full price.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it, I fell in love with it immediately.</li>
            <li> Never disappointed with benefit.</li>
            <li> i was willing to pay more if it would work, but all i get is layer upon layer of stuff, which seems to cake up.</li>
            <li> WAS SO EXCITED TO GET THIS.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to purchase this product.</li>
            <li> Eye bright is the only product I wouldn&#x27;t buy again (and again just cos</li>
            <li> So the only thing I won&#x27;t buy from the kit is the Eye Bright.</li>
            <li> bright - this is the only one that didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll discover that some work and some don&#x27;t, but without paying full price.  </li>
            <li> When I run out, I plan on buying the full sized products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I did buy this, though, because now I know I won&#x27;t be buying Benefit conceal products and wasting my money when I realize they don&#x27;t really work.&lt;br</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve tried so many combinations but have never found any that will really do the trick.</li>
            <li> This is a great buy due to the price, the quality and by allowing you to expore the brand.     </li>
            <li> The packaging is cute and clever and you get plenty of each product.</li>
            <li> YEAH, SUPER GLUE.</li>
            <li> because breaking out the super glue on something i JUST BOUGHT IS</li>
            <li> This kit is great for a sample kit of all of their products that help with dark circles under your eyes.</li>
            <li> Its definitely a great value for when you want to try out new makeup without spending the extra cash for each one separately.</li>
            <li> I loved the concept of this conceal box, but it isn&#x27;t very effective; it&#x27;s apparent now that I was more drawn to the flashy marketing.</li>
            <li> Well, the real that gal primer smells fruity and light.</li>
            <li> Benefit cosmetics make a consistently great product IF you are 15 and want to cover up, say, a bruise you aquired while rubbing a wildflower too harshly against your face.</li>
            <li> This definitely comes in handy for those cases.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Overall i liked the idea of the kit</li>
            <li> It has a useful guide that I use every time I try to conceal.</li>
            <li> HOWEVER, it did come right from</li>
            <li> it arrived fine, looks new</li>
            <li> It is interesting and elegant, but it&#x27;s not great functionally - there is much better concealer out there.</li>
            <li> it works but it could be better with I little more smoother result.</li>
            <li> I love this cute little set.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad that they offered a sampler in a cute little case like this.  </li>
            <li> Benefit&#x27;s concealer is actually really nice - it helps to even out skin tone and is pretty long lasting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The real one has soft bristles that are able to be cleaned without a problem.</li>
            <li> so all in all, cute box, cute products, waste of money.</li>
            <li> Most of it didn&#x27;t work, and there were some serious creasing problems, which is kind of embarrassing if your goal is a no-makeup makeup look.</li>
            <li> At first I didn&#x27;t see the point, but need a 5 min face?</li>
            <li> u just have to set it in with your favorite pressed powder so it last all day!</li>
            <li> but if I had to purchase this again I would only purchase my favorite products separately when I run out..</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think however that it would be enough for many applications.  </li>
            <li> so if you are wanting to travel with only one or two things you might not be able to.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s gone so fast!</li>
            <li> it was time to refresh my smudge pots, and a friend told me i should do it here, since some colors (not the popular ones, like black, bronze, etc) are discounted (she was right, so i took advantage).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super light in consistency, goes on smoothly, but doesn&#x27;t stay, and creases after just a few</li>
            <li> almost 3-D like in the photo you are shown above, or really even more than HALF-way, as it shows in the photo.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even think anyone else would notice it, just me :) Small price to pay for a great concealer for dark circles.</li>
            <li> but i would HIGHLY recommend buying from a reputable source, and NOT from here, especially..</li>
            <li> , you certainly get what you pay for...</li>
            <li> I bought this mainly because I never tried these products and didn&#x27;t want to spend a lot of money on something I couldn&#x27;t try first.  </li>
            <li> : I got a huge zit on my forehead, and boi-ing made it instantly invisible.</li>
            <li> If this item hasn&#x27;t been working for you, do not worry about it because it may not be real...</li>
            <li> living in the real world.</li>
            <li> And really, how can one even put a price on that?</li>
            <li> so i got REALLY screwed...)</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t seem to do much of anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really work for me...</li>
            <li> My face looks so much fresher when I use this.</li>
            <li> It will help you determine if yours is real</li>
            <li> These concealers are designed to appeal to and meet the needs of yonger people who want trendy brightness, not medium to heavy coverage.</li>
            <li> Other than being gipped on actual product, the brushes themselves looked/felt greasy, so those will be getting a good dousing of eye make-up remover and washed well before ANY use..</li>
            <li> it works ok, but so does revlon and other cheaper stuff from the drugstore.</li>
            <li> I have read a bunch of reviews for the items that are included in this kit and it was great to be able to get the kit and try the items out (without having to spend a lot of money on full-sizes and then be disappointed).  </li>
            <li> Erase Paste is nice, but does not cover the natural dark circles.</li>
            <li> They go on very creamy and the product quality is high.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Erase Paste: Again, this is most helpful when it comes to those dark</li>
            <li> and depending on how often you plan to use the regime of cream concealer, eyelid primer, under-eye brightener, etc etc, it is probably only about a 3 month supply when FULL.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a really good amount of the erase paste, and you only need a little at a time anyway.</li>
            <li> These products do nothing for people who are either 1) older than 20 or 2)</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve had them forever and now that i&#x27;m getting older</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this for others of my skin tone and type.</li>
            <li> I like to little box that has a cute mirror.</li>
            <li> It covers at first, but certainly does not last all day, and I even used Smashbox primer before</li>
            <li> But the combinbation of these products make me look refreshed, young, awake and vibrant!</li>
            <li> This would make for a great bridesmaid gift or a gift in general, but it&#x27;s very small quantity for the price!</li>
            <li> i was so excited to receive this product after reading so many good reviews about boi-ing, lemon-aid and erase paste for covering my seriously ugly dark circles under my eyes.</li>
            <li> you can just bring it right back, used or unused, and they will swap it for you and make it right.&lt;br</li>
            <li> new and got samples with my purchase.</li>
            <li> it is a good thing i noticed it, and that it COULD be glued, or this would be a MUCH less informative and a much more angry review.. which i think i should be pissed off, anyway.</li>
            <li> I love this little case!  </li>
            <li> first mistake was trying a new (to me) product, and not going through Sephora.com or benefit.com, or just an actual brick-and-mortar store first, since i only had reviews and seller ratings to rely on and, knowing i wanted/needed the item anyway for my kit (i am a freelance MUA)</li>
            <li> /&gt;Lemon-aid was my favorite and really made my eyes pop - but it also had a serious creasing problem.</li>
            <li> The sample sizes of these do not bother me, as they are such a good quality only a small bit is needed.</li>
            <li> to super glue it back together, or rip off the entire cover/mirror...</li>
            <li> the eye bright is useless, as is that gal.</li>
            <li> it felt like it melted away with the natural oil in my skin.</li>
            <li> This set is really good, but sadly, does not include the Holy Grail concealer I have been seeking.   </li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve tried this cute little box of goodies every which way to sunday and nothing is working to really cover my dark circles.</li>
            <li> However, it is good for when you have dark circles under your eyes after that late night of partying and you need to look alive for work.</li>
            <li> The booings are better for other parts of the face other than under the eyes because they are not so blendable.</li>
            <li> If I were to buy that only it would be the same price as this whole set!</li>
            <li> I already bought the full size Erase Paste (my miracle secret weapon since I have the most dreaded dark circles) and the That Gal primer.</li>
            <li> I would get much more, but since only a very small amount is needed</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not for everyone, I have a medium to light complexion, acne-free but slightly blotchy and dry skin.</li>
            <li> This is actually an amazing product, however, the sellers on Amazon are selling fake items.</li>
            <li> I did not like this and don&#x27;t care for benefit products in general.</li>
            <li> I would reccommend this to anyone who wants to fake a full 8 hours rest and have skin that glows like a teenagers!</li>
            <li> but i will be SURE to restock it BEFORE i run out, at Sephora where i should and always should get my make-up and tools, because if you open up your box to a bunch of half-packed trays of make-up (which are very small to begin with, this is ONLY a sample-sizes kit!</li>
            <li> I did get a $5.00 credit but the part of this makeup kit is the important part it was discolored and hard as a rock!</li>
            <li> and finally the eye bright was the least of my favorites it was just too chalky and dry and hard to apply.</li>
            <li> The darker one is a lot darker and the lighter one is a little lighter then the real one.</li>
            <li> I especially like how the kit gives you two shades because my skin tone changes as the weather gets different, so its hard to find a concealer that exactly blends with my skin</li>
            <li> Also, upon opening my shrink-wrapped to a cardboard backing little box, i immediately flipped back the slightly-magnetic closure front cover, only to discover that it was ripped completely from the kit itself, along with the side boning, so i had no choice but</li>
            <li> &quot;: I&#x27;m not a big fan of face primer as I&#x27;m not really convinced it makes that big of a difference.</li>
            <li> The brushes are a lot more stiff in the fake palette and after several days of usage, the bristles of the brush will start seperating themselves.</li>
            <li> i also needed several other things, also decided to buy the 3-pack mini cheeky&#x27;s set, and the smudge &amp; line #28 brush.</li>
            <li> When I got the makeup it looked like it had been sitting for a very long time.</li>
            <li> they were EXTREMELY shallow with make-up, and possibly even used and re-smoothed or stamped, if the person knew what they were doing; but my purchase was for a brand new &#x27;Benefit-</li>
            <li> For me, they don&#x27;t clog my pores or anything, and they don&#x27;t get all flaky on a dry spot.</li>
            <li> I probably should have stuck with a single concealer instead of the kit</li>
            <li> Even though I might be repetitive, the main use of this is to help with dark</li>
            <li> this specific order, i also got the black smudge pot.</li>
            <li> but I have very dark circles under my eyes and my lids are always red.</li>
            <li> and will probably file a complaint DIRECTLY with Amazon.com.&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, this primer does make eyeshadow stay on longer and makes it harder to smear which is always useful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but u have to be careful with that one.</li>
            <li> partial conclusion-</li>
            <li> so it stays closed, but I haven&#x27;t traveled with this myself, so</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how well it would hold closed while getting tossed around in a purse.  </li>
            <li> Cat hair in the box, not very sanitary.</li>
            <li> I didnt realize how small everything was even though I read that in comments from people it was still smaller than expected.</li>
            <li> I like the yellow and pink highlighter, but again, so small in quantity</li>
            <li> a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way with Benefits</li>
            <li> a little goes a long way with this concealer.</li>
            <li> purple/yellow neutralize each other)</li>
            <li> And the brushes were pretty useless for me.</li>
            <li> AND THE 2 OTHER CONCEALERS DONT COVER</li>
            <li> The second I blinked after applying it there was a very heavy crease.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product to make your face beautiful even on a really bad, bad day!</li>
            <li> The erase paste in the fake product is plastic and the the real one is glass.</li>
            <li> The boi-oing colors also have too much of a contrast in the fake one.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve tried using just the boi-ing (both colors together and separately), the boi-ing with just the lemon aid under and even over, i&#x27;ve started with that gal and the erase paste (which seems way too dark for my medium skin).</li>
            <li> good products, TERRIBLE SELLER, GO TO a store!!ith Amazon.com.   </li>
            <li> good products, TERRIBLE SELLER, GO TO a store!!</li>
            <li> The fake product&#x27;s packaging is also a little bit lighter in comparison to the real one.</li>
            <li> The only complain I have is the erase paste is a little thick and too peachy for my skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;the pans of the make-up were not full, not lush-looking and</li>
            <li> If dark circles are a problem for you, try this kit!</li>
            <li> The colors may be a little off for some.</li>
            <li> I just use a little of each of the Boing concealers and blend the two colors to match my skin tone and Walla</li>
            <li> my dark circles gone!</li>
            <li> However, the reason I only rate this 3 stars is because after I wrapped this gift and gave it to my friend, when she opened it, the mirror was broken.</li>
            <li> , i purchased it here because it was out of stock anyway on Sephora.com, and a few bucks cheaper here...</li>
            <li> I am over 50 with a few noticeable age spots and they concealer works</li>
            <li> All the other stuff as small as it is is plenty if you just use it to cover small areas at a time.</li>
            <li> Now, I don&#x27;t have to with this kit because it takes care of everything from dull skin and dark circles to blemishes.</li>
            <li> I work two jobs and unfortunetly get very little sleep....</li>
            <li> If you cake too much on, it will crease, but just a little bit is enough to cover the worst bags (a.k.a my circles before heading to school)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> even though it&#x27;s kinda small, but what can I expect for the price?    </li>
            <li> it looks small but it contains a lot of product..</li>
            <li> now, usually i shop at Sephora, in-store or online, to guarantee authenticity, try before i by, and have a place to return it to if anything goes wrong.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The box is fairly small though, and I don&#x27;t think it would be that bulky to take around.  </li>
            <li> I like the small brushes that come with the kit too.  </li>
            <li> THE BRUSHES ARE WAY TO SMALL .AND</li>
            <li> it gives a hint of shimmer to my pale, dull complexion</li>
            <li> hard to tell..</li>
            <li> It was too hard to get on the brush</li>
            <li> Some people had said its hard to apply and I don&#x27;t get that at all.</li>
            <li> the lemon-aid alone on my eyelids is too hard to spread, even with eye cream just applied.</li>
            <li> I use it when I am running late</li>
            <li> so if you do buy it, at least you can affix it over your face like a mask and maybe get some coverage that way.</li>
            <li> , i am unhappy with this specific order.</li>
            <li> THE COVERAGE IS NOT GOOD</li>
            <li> I know it wasn&#x27;t shipped broken because I checked</li>
            <li> For example, Erase Paste makes my imperfections worse.  </li>
            <li> not to mention, sending BROKEN packaged items?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m confused because a lot of products, like Bahama Mama, that used to be Benefit now say &#x27;The Balm.&#x27;  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a mother of 2 active toddlers and I have bad circles</li>
            <li> The one I have bought off Amazon is indeed, a fake.</li>
            <li> Way over priced for the size and quality and makeup had weird spots in it when it arrived.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Real vs Fake Benefit Confessions of a Concealaholic Palette&amp;#34</li>
            <li> as the title of my review suggets, I received a fake one.</li>
            <li> It may be fake.</li>
            <li> It was fake.</li>
            <li> It was worse than kid play makeup!</li>
            <li> Very poorly made knock off.</li>
            <li> &#x27;Benefit&#x27; SO, if this is how they conduct their business, by sending out such SHODDY merchandise, than i am appalled and disgusted!!!</li>
            <li> VERY SAD TO REPORT THIS.</li>
            <li> This is very expensive for what you get.</li>
            <li> I must say I was reluctant because of the bad reviews</li>
            <li> I have bad under eye circles and purchasing this at a discounted price was great!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The fake primer smells DISGUSTING.</li>
            <li> Smelled horrible.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I&#x27;m a huge Benefit fan and I usually love all the makeup I buy from them. This was actually a Christmas present for a friend but I already knew most of the product before I bought it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;That Gal\\&quot;: I&#x27;m not a big fan of face primer as I&#x27;m not really convinced it makes that big of a difference. However, it is good for when you have dark circles under your eyes after that late night of partying and you need to look alive for work. This definitely comes in handy for those cases.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Erase Paste: Again, this is most helpful when it comes to those dark circles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Boi-ing: Benefit&#x27;s concealer is actually really nice - it helps to even out skin tone and is pretty long lasting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lemon aid: Personally, I don&#x27;t see a big difference with eyelid primer and without in terms of color. However, this primer does make eyeshadow stay on longer and makes it harder to smear which is always useful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eye bright: Even though I might be repetitive, the main use of this is to help with dark circles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion? This kit is great for a sample kit of all of their products that help with dark circles under your eyes. However, the reason I only rate this 3 stars is because after I wrapped this gift and gave it to my friend, when she opened it, the mirror was broken. I know it wasn&#x27;t shipped broken because I checked but the fact that it could break so easily makes me not want to buy this product again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Sample sizes of products makes it easy to try a lot of Benefit&#x27;s concealer line&lt;br /&gt;-Cute packaging&lt;br /&gt;-Great size for a gift&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-Most of the products are just ok&lt;br /&gt;-Too fragile! The mirror breaks really easily</li>
            <li> I must say I was reluctant because of the bad reviews but I&#x27;m glad I bought it. I got to try all the products and see if I liked them. And I do. Erase paste is a very potent concealer: the color matches my skin color and I love it. The booings are better for other parts of the face other than under the eyes because they are not so blendable. But the fact you can mix the two colors to match your skin tone is excellent. Lemon aid is also vey good: better as a lid color corrector than as a primer, though. Eye bright is the only product I wouldn&#x27;t buy again (and again just cos it&#x27;s not in a pencil shape in this kit). If dark circles are a problem for you, try this kit! I use these almost evey day.</li>
            <li> I never review products on Amazon, but I absolutely love this thing. I&#x27;m OCD and it&#x27;s really nice to have a tint/base, 2 colors of concealer, special undereye concealer, eye brightener, and color corrector (purple/yellow neutralize each other) all in one compact kit. It&#x27;s not for everyone, I have a medium to light complexion, acne-free but slightly blotchy and dry skin. Others seem to have had a problem with the oily nature of the products. For me, they don&#x27;t clog my pores or anything, and they don&#x27;t get all flaky on a dry spot. I would highly recommend this for others of my skin tone and type.</li>
            <li> I like this kit a lot! even though it&#x27;s kinda small, but what can I expect for the price?    I think that the best product of this kit is the erase paste, I&#x27;m going to buy it later separately.</li>
            <li> This comes with a lot of product, almost more than you can use. I probably should have stuck with a single concealer instead of the kit but i will eventually use most of it im sure. The Boing concealer is a bit oily, or more oily than i&#x27;m used to...</li>
            <li> This is a great buy due to the price, the quality and by allowing you to expore the brand.     The concealers are the best! They COVER, blend well, and last allll day. The colors may be a little off for some. The medium is working great for my neutral medium skintone. (I do however also use this over Stay Don&#x27;t Stray which btw is the best concealer on the market and matches my skin winter and summer) (i crave coverage)    I find the paste to be off even more in tone making it even more unuseable for some. Its just ok.    Not a primer girl (oily skin) not for me    the eyebright.... hard to tell.. its doing something.. not being in pencil form may effect quality.    Lemonade. At first I didn&#x27;t see the point, but need a 5 min face? This product makes the no-makeup-look look better. I use it when I am running late makes my face look awake and healthy by making the eyelid color even and nice and healthy looking.    the brushes break apart and under no way would I ever put this in my purse be it would come open and get ruined    overall found some products I Love and some I can do without</li>
            <li> This is actually an amazing product, however, the sellers on Amazon are selling fake items. If this item hasn&#x27;t been working for you, do not worry about it because it may not be real... The one I have bought off Amazon is indeed, a fake. How can I tell? Well, the real that gal primer smells fruity and light. The fake primer smells DISGUSTING. It literally smells like puke and has made me break out. The brushes are a lot more stiff in the fake palette and after several days of usage, the bristles of the brush will start seperating themselves. The real one has soft bristles that are able to be cleaned without a problem. The erase paste in the fake product is plastic and the the real one is glass. The fake product&#x27;s packaging is also a little bit lighter in comparison to the real one. The boi-oing colors also have too much of a contrast in the fake one. The darker one is a lot darker and the lighter one is a little lighter then the real one.</li>
            <li> I love it when Benefit has kits like this...you can sample all the products for a great price.  You&#x27;ll discover that some work and some don&#x27;t, but without paying full price.  For example, Erase Paste makes my imperfections worse.  That Gal works great.  Lemon Aid does wonders too!  This little set is perfect for home use and a great deal....</li>
            <li> Love the way they all work together comes with great instructions that include explanations on what each product does and how to use it.</li>
            <li> I got this because I wanted to see if it worked on me because I have a lot of discoloration under my eyes. The first time I used it, I fell in love with it immediately. I just use a little of each of the Boing concealers and blend the two colors to match my skin tone and Walla my dark circles gone! u just have to set it in with your favorite pressed powder so it last all day! luv it! &amp; recommend it 2 everyone with under eye problems. Its the best product I&#x27;ve tried. &amp; its industrial strength. The lemon aide is a good product but u have to be careful with that one. a little bit goes a long way. u can easily over do it. and look unnatural if your under florescent lights. The erase paste I didn&#x27;t like because it just didn&#x27;t last. it felt like it melted away with the natural oil in my skin. That Gal face primer is ok it works but it could be better with I little more smoother result. and finally the eye bright was the least of my favorites it was just too chalky and dry and hard to apply. ** Overall i liked the idea of the kit but if I had to purchase this again I would only purchase my favorite products separately when I run out.. BTW I bought it when it use to be $36 with free shipping. and I thought that was pricey!</li>
            <li> Benefit has the best line of products. Their products are pretty pricey, so this little case was a great bargin that came with many of their best products. A little goes a long way with Benefits - I would highly recommend this to anyone who loves great coverage because Benefits provides a flawless complexion with this kit.</li>
            <li> Benefit cosmetics make a consistently great product IF you are 15 and want to cover up, say, a bruise you aquired while rubbing a wildflower too harshly against your face. Or, if you got tapped in the cheek during a tickle fight. These products do nothing for people who are either 1) older than 20 or 2) living in the real world. These concealers are designed to appeal to and meet the needs of yonger people who want trendy brightness, not medium to heavy coverage. Benefit products are for teenagers with exceptional skin, period. This product is not an exception to this rule. It&#x27;s cute packaging so if you do buy it, at least you can affix it over your face like a mask and maybe get some coverage that way.</li>
            <li> it looks small but it contains a lot of product.. There&#x27;s a really good amount of the erase paste, and you only need a little at a time anyway. The longer you wear it though, the more it tends to settle in your creases. And the brushes were pretty useless for me. Still an over all great set. Good value for your money.</li>
            <li> I didnt realize how small everything was even though I read that in comments from people it was still smaller than expected. The \\&quot;that gal\\&quot; stuff didnt make too much difference, but it is still a good primer...pleasant smell. I don&#x27;t think however that it would be enough for many applications.  All the other stuff as small as it is is plenty if you just use it to cover small areas at a time. They all work good although after using it as directed, i wasnt completely satisfied, so then i just tried using the products my way as i saw fit, and i liked the results much better.  It is a good product overall, but the price, maybe not so much, but like ive read what others say, it is a really good way to try all the products and then decide which ones youd buy at full price.</li>
            <li> I love this cute little set. The erase paste is my favorite. If I were to buy that only it would be the same price as this whole set! Granted I would get much more, but since only a very small amount is needed this seemed like a much better deal! The sample sizes of these do not bother me, as they are such a good quality only a small bit is needed. I work two jobs and unfortunetly get very little sleep.... But the combinbation of these products make me look refreshed, young, awake and vibrant! And really, how can one even put a price on that? I would reccommend this to anyone who wants to fake a full 8 hours rest and have skin that glows like a teenagers!</li>
            <li> I already bought the full size Erase Paste (my miracle secret weapon since I have the most dreaded dark circles) and the That Gal primer. When I run out I will buy the Boi-ing concealer and the Lemon aid. So the only thing I won&#x27;t buy from the kit is the Eye Bright. The packaging is cute and clever and you get plenty of each product. I am very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> All of them are great! I would repurchase all of them individually! I gave it 4 stars because the erase paste creases just a tiny bit once and a while. I don&#x27;t even think anyone else would notice it, just me :) Small price to pay for a great concealer for dark circles.</li>
            <li> I used to mix about 5 different concealers in the morning. Now, I don&#x27;t have to with this kit because it takes care of everything from dull skin and dark circles to blemishes. When I run out, I plan on buying the full sized products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;erase paste - best for dark circles. a little goes a long way with this concealer. If you cake too much on, it will crease, but just a little bit is enough to cover the worst bags (a.k.a my circles before heading to school)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;that gal primer - I love this! it gives a hint of shimmer to my pale, dull complexion&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;boi-ing: I got a huge zit on my forehead, and boi-ing made it instantly invisible. I especially like how the kit gives you two shades because my skin tone changes as the weather gets different, so its hard to find a concealer that exactly blends with my skin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;lemon-aid: I wear a light purple eye shadow from Clinique that always used to fade before the afternoon. But lemon-aid keeps it in place and freshens up my eyelids&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;eye bright - this is the only one that didn&#x27;t work. It was too hard to get on the brush</li>
            <li> so, let me start off by saying i LOVE benefit make-up. it was time to refresh my smudge pots, and a friend told me i should do it here, since some colors (not the popular ones, like black, bronze, etc) are discounted (she was right, so i took advantage). i also needed several other things, also decided to buy the 3-pack mini cheeky&#x27;s set, and the smudge &amp; line #28 brush. now, usually i shop at Sephora, in-store or online, to guarantee authenticity, try before i by, and have a place to return it to if anything goes wrong.&lt;br /&gt;my first mistake was trying a new (to me) product, and not going through Sephora.com or benefit.com, or just an actual brick-and-mortar store first, since i only had reviews and seller ratings to rely on and, knowing i wanted/needed the item anyway for my kit (i am a freelance MUA), i purchased it here because it was out of stock anyway on Sephora.com, and a few bucks cheaper here... HOWEVER, it did come right from &#x27;Benefit&#x27; SO, if this is how they conduct their business, by sending out such SHODDY merchandise, than i am appalled and disgusted!!! this is NOW how a so-called make-up conglomerate should be representing itself, in ANY VENUE!!&lt;br /&gt;well, you certainly get what you pay for...&lt;br /&gt;the pans of the make-up were not full, not lush-looking and almost 3-D like in the photo you are shown above, or really even more than HALF-way, as it shows in the photo. they were EXTREMELY shallow with make-up, and possibly even used and re-smoothed or stamped, if the person knew what they were doing; but my purchase was for a brand new &#x27;Benefit- Confessions of a Concealaholic set&#x27;. Other than being gipped on actual product, the brushes themselves looked/felt greasy, so those will be getting a good dousing of eye make-up remover and washed well before ANY use.. Also, upon opening my shrink-wrapped to a cardboard backing little box, i immediately flipped back the slightly-magnetic closure front cover, only to discover that it was ripped completely from the kit itself, along with the side boning, so i had no choice but to super glue it back together, or rip off the entire cover/mirror... YEAH, SUPER GLUE. AWESOME. because breaking out the super glue on something i JUST BOUGHT IS SO what i love to do!! partial conclusion- DO NOT SHOP HERE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;with this specific order, i also got the black smudge pot. it arrived fine, looks new and i have no complaints about it.  but, for a non-discounted item +shipping costs, i am SURE they wouldn&#x27;t skimp..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;overall, i am unhappy with this specific order. i will use it, until it is gone but i will be SURE to restock it BEFORE i run out, at Sephora where i should and always should get my make-up and tools, because if you open up your box to a bunch of half-packed trays of make-up (which are very small to begin with, this is ONLY a sample-sizes kit! and depending on how often you plan to use the regime of cream concealer, eyelid primer, under-eye brightener, etc etc, it is probably only about a 3 month supply when FULL. so i got REALLY screwed...) you can just bring it right back, used or unused, and they will swap it for you and make it right.&lt;br /&gt;SO now, i am stuck with a nearly-empty starter kit, that (between using it on myself every now and then, and using it for clients for different issues, it MIGHT last me two months. MIGHT. it IS a really great box to own, substantial-wise and the products are great.. but i would HIGHLY recommend buying from a reputable source, and NOT from here, especially.. i will barely be beginning to learn to perfect the look and this new product into my regime by the time it runs out! not to mention, sending BROKEN packaged items? what if this had been a present? i would have been MORTIFIED!! it is a good thing i noticed it, and that it COULD be glued, or this would be a MUCH less informative and a much more angry review.. which i think i should be pissed off, anyway. but i will just be sure NEVER TO BUY FROM HERE EVER AGAIN! and will probably file a complaint DIRECTLY with Amazon.com.&lt;br /&gt;hope this review is helpful! good products, TERRIBLE SELLER, GO TO a store!!ith Amazon.com.   hope this review is helpful! good products, TERRIBLE SELLER, GO TO a store!!</li>
            <li> I have read a bunch of reviews for the items that are included in this kit and it was great to be able to get the kit and try the items out (without having to spend a lot of money on full-sizes and then be disappointed).  This set is really good, but sadly, does not include the Holy Grail concealer I have been seeking.   For those who do not have any signs of aging under the eyes, this is a GREAT kit. But, for those that do have some under eye lines, the products do settle into the wrinkles and make them appear even more. You have to constantly tap, tap, tap throughout the morning to keep it from caking up.   They go on very creamy and the product quality is high.</li>
            <li> Arrived in time - the packaging is adorable.  The product is awesome.  Highly recommend this product to make your face beautiful even on a really bad, bad day!</li>
            <li> This is some of the best concealer I&#x27;ve ever used! My daughter has acne and she had a pageant to be in and you can&#x27;t even tell she had any breakouts. We used boing for that but I have very dark circles under my eyes and my lids are always red. The lemonaid took care of that. I will definately buy again!</li>
            <li> I am over 50 with a few noticeable age spots and they concealer works it&#x27;s magic.  Never disappointed with benefit.</li>
            <li> I loved the concept of this conceal box, but it isn&#x27;t very effective; it&#x27;s apparent now that I was more drawn to the flashy marketing. I&#x27;m glad I did buy this, though, because now I know I won&#x27;t be buying Benefit conceal products and wasting my money when I realize they don&#x27;t really work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bo-ing is definitely not \\&quot;industrial strength\\&quot; concealer. It covers at first, but certainly does not last all day, and I even used Smashbox primer before applying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Erase Paste is nice, but does not cover the natural dark circles. It&#x27;s super light in consistency, goes on smoothly, but doesn&#x27;t stay, and creases after just a few short hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That Gal just gives me a shiny, greasy look. I am never buying that product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eye Bright - I don&#x27;t really get the point of this one. Didn&#x27;t seem to do much of anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lemon-aid was my favorite and really made my eyes pop - but it also had a serious creasing problem. The second I blinked after applying it there was a very heavy crease.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So not for me. Most of it didn&#x27;t work, and there were some serious creasing problems, which is kind of embarrassing if your goal is a no-makeup makeup look.</li>
            <li> When I got the makeup it looked like it had been sitting for a very long time. I did get a $5.00 credit but the part of this makeup kit is the important part it was discolored and hard as a rock! I did say ok to the credit but I won&#x27;t buy again. This make up is a very good makeup and I could have bought brand  new and got samples with my purchase. J.Robinson</li>
            <li> Way over priced for the size and quality and makeup had weird spots in it when it arrived. Concealer was to tacky and creases. I did not like this and don&#x27;t care for benefit products in general. I don&#x27;t recommend this.</li>
            <li> Ok, maybe some of you can help me out... One, I used to buy this kit for $35 so why is it $30 more now? and Two, did Benefits change its name to &#x27;The Balm&#x27;?  I&#x27;m confused because a lot of products, like Bahama Mama, that used to be Benefit now say &#x27;The Balm.&#x27;  If they did change their name, I don&#x27;t think it was a good idea, and now the confusion and price changes have me looking for alternatives!</li>
            <li> I bought this mainly because I never tried these products and didn&#x27;t want to spend a lot of money on something I couldn&#x27;t try first.  I love this little case!  And I love the products in it too!  I&#x27;m glad that they offered a sampler in a cute little case like this.  Only 2 of the products come in a separate container so if you are wanting to travel with only one or two things you might not be able to.  The box is fairly small though, and I don&#x27;t think it would be that bulky to take around.  The box closure is magnetic so it stays closed, but I haven&#x27;t traveled with this myself, so I don&#x27;t know how well it would hold closed while getting tossed around in a purse.  I like the small brushes that come with the kit too.  I think that this is a great package for traveling with especially if you are a concealaholic!</li>
            <li> I think this is an awesome little case. I just received it today and had to try it out. The only complain I have is the erase paste is a little thick and too peachy for my skin. But other then that the rest of the product is awesome. Its definitely a great value for when you want to try out new makeup without spending the extra cash for each one separately.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really work for me...I usually love Benefit products.  I have olive skin and maybe this set is for fair skinned ladies.</li>
            <li> I love love love this. My face looks so much fresher when I use this. Some people had said its hard to apply and I don&#x27;t get that at all. Nor do I agree that it settles into creases. This is magic in a box. I&#x27;m a mother of 2 active toddlers and I have bad circles but you wouldn&#x27;t know when I use this.</li>
            <li> i was so excited to receive this product after reading so many good reviews about boi-ing, lemon-aid and erase paste for covering my seriously ugly dark circles under my eyes. i&#x27;ve had them forever and now that i&#x27;m getting older (41) they sure seem more noticable. i&#x27;ve tried this cute little box of goodies every which way to sunday and nothing is working to really cover my dark circles. it works ok, but so does revlon and other cheaper stuff from the drugstore. nothing better. i was willing to pay more if it would work, but all i get is layer upon layer of stuff, which seems to cake up. i&#x27;ve tried using just the boi-ing (both colors together and separately), the boi-ing with just the lemon aid under and even over, i&#x27;ve started with that gal and the erase paste (which seems way too dark for my medium skin). i&#x27;ve tried putting my foundation under it all, over it all. i&#x27;ve tried so many combinations but have never found any that will really do the trick. i&#x27;ve used the included brushes, i&#x27;ve used just my fingers like some of the reviewers have recommended. zilch. the lemon-aid alone on my eyelids is too hard to spread, even with eye cream just applied. the eye bright is useless, as is that gal. so all in all, cute box, cute products, waste of money.</li>
            <li> I like to little box that has a cute mirror. It has a useful guide that I use every time I try to conceal. Every cream is very good quality, and covers well.</li>
            <li> VERY SAD TO REPORT THIS. I AM HUGE FAN OF BENIFIT AN WAS SO EXCITED TO GET THIS. THE BRUSHES ARE WAY TO SMALL .AND THE COVERAGE IS NOT GOOD AT ALL . THAT GAL BARLEY DOSE ANYTHING. AND THE 2 OTHER CONCEALERS DONT COVER AT ALL . I CONTACTED THEM FOR A REFUND . AND I WAS REFUSED. THEY WONT TAKE IT BACK .I THINK I GOT  ABD BATCH . THEY WONT EVEN EXCHANGE IT. NEVER WILL I BUY AGAIN . OR WILL I BUY FORM THIS SELLER.</li>
            <li> This would make for a great bridesmaid gift or a gift in general, but it&#x27;s very small quantity for the price! I bought it because I travel and it&#x27;s great for touch ups on the car. It is interesting and elegant, but it&#x27;s not great functionally - there is much better concealer out there. The face primer turned out to be the thing I didn&#x27;t really want, but my favorite! I like the yellow and pink highlighter, but again, so small in quantity it&#x27;s gone so fast! This is very expensive for what you get. I won&#x27;t re-buy anything but the face primer.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to purchase this product. I have bad under eye circles and purchasing this at a discounted price was great!&lt;br /&gt;I purchased from Makeup Marketplace www.amazon.com/shops/A3L4UNUCDLVVR7&lt;br /&gt;I was looking for reviews on YouTube and I came across the video&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Real vs Fake Benefit Confessions of a Concealaholic Palette&amp;#34; Watch it. It will help you determine if yours is real&lt;br /&gt;and as the title of my review suggets, I received a fake one. It didn&#x27;t even have the instructions manual. Very poorly made knock off. I was able to detect it as soon as I saw it.&lt;br /&gt;Beware when you purchase this product. It may be fake. You may be better off buying it at full price at the store or the brands website.</li>
            <li> Cat hair in the box, not very sanitary.</li>
            <li> We purchased this make-up kit for our daughter for a Hanukkah present. It was a big hit. The concealer worked great under the eyes. IT comes in a cute box.</li>

            <li> It was fake. Smelled horrible. It was worse than kid play makeup! I wish I didn&#x27;t have to give it even one star!</li>
