    <ol>
            <li> Absolutely love this cologne</li>
            <li> Advertised the the 4.6 oz bottle, for a very attractive price.  When it arrived it, it was the 2.6 oz bottle.  I bought this once before and thought that I had made a mistake ordering.  FOOL ME ONCE, SHAME ON YOU, FOOL ME TWICE, SHAME ON ME! Never again!</li>
            <li> MAKES MY FELLA SMELL AS WONDERFUL AS HE LOOKS : )</li>
            <li> Went to Macy&#x27;s to try out cologne. Truly loved this scent. They wanted $75. I checked on Amazon and it was much cheaper so I went that route. Very pleased with the product.</li>
            <li> This bottles scent is lighter than the same bottle I got from Macy&#x27;s. However this one was much more affordable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cologne for 10+ years.  It is still my favorite.  I highly recommend it to anyone who hasn&#x27;t tried it.</li>
            <li> I received this gift in the original sealed package, but the box looked like it had water damage, or the bottle leaked. I opened everything and couldn&#x27;t find a leak. The price was the best I found online or in store.</li>
            <li> My purchase came in really fast and the price was amazing. You will never find prices and quality anywhere else. Will be doing more purchasing in the future. :)</li>
            <li> I order this fo my hubby as he alys use the product I saw the price was little low than the one i brought it from a mall , bt I don&#x27;t know we feel that this one is duplicate or what the smell goes so fast it&#x27;s nt long lasting nt gonna buy it online anymore</li>
            <li> I am new to the Polo Blue Cologne line and I really like it! I haven&#x27;t received any compliments yet. However, at 65 I have noticed a lot of the gals like to be close to me lately. The cologne arrived&lt;br /&gt;from the seller as promised. Packaged well to prevent leakage and damage.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a girl, but it&#x27;s one of my favorites!</li>
            <li> my favorite cologne to have my husband wear and the price is best on amazon</li>
            <li> As the headline says, the cologne I bought from here was one of the best I have ever had. I have bought many from different department stores, all being expensive. Most of them were not even potent enough to last through a work day. This cologne is potent, lasts many hours, and smells great! One of the best purchases I have made.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this cologne, but it has become increasingly difficult to find. I was happy to find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I shopped high and low for this version of Polo and found just what I was looking for---at a great price.  It arrived several days prior to the promised delivery date---although I bought it at the peak of the holiday season.  It was double boxed and secured to prevent damage in transit.  My grandson never expected to receive this because of the average cost, but this vendor priced it so that it was affordable.  I am very pleased with my purchase and planned shop with them in the future</li>
            <li> love the scent-doesn&#x27;t last too long which is the way it should be&lt;br /&gt;. Good buy</li>

            <li> I was not impressed with the smell. But each person have different impressions. Mine was not impressed,</li>
