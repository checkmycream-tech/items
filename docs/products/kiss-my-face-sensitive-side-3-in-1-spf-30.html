            <li>Unless you happen to be a marathon swimmer who is going to be soaked for hour and hours in the oceans&#x27; salty water without any shade, which Vaseline will act as the best sealer there is, then for a surfer like me, usually higher organic ingredients are the best.</li>

            <li>/&gt;Check out the 2013 reports and you will find out that this did not offer protection in compare to the Target brand regardless of all their claims and all their good ingredients...</li>
            <li>but it is good to know that there are fewer chemicals in the sunscreen.</li>

            <li>This is absolutely the best sunscreen I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li>great product - great protection and absorbs into your skin with reasonable application effort.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I liked the way this sunscreen wears.</li>
            <li>Shipped quickly, was in great condition.</li>
            <li>Works better than any popular brands and is &amp;#34;natural.&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li>The best for sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>I applied no sunscreen -- I am super burned!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very light and not oily at all.</li>
            <li>I am also very light skinned.</li>
            <li>Overall very happy with the product and the shipping/buying experience!</li>
            <li>Even my teen girls like wearing it, which makes me happy!</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>The texture is nice - goes on smooth.</li>
            <li>Great Product, I really recomend it</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>This one is better.</li>
            <li>If I weren&#x27;t so broke I would buy something more matte.</li>
            <li>Much better than the top selling brands.</li>
            <li>In fact, the skin on my arms is looking more supple and moisturized.</li>
            <li>:)  </li>
            <li>I got this on Thrive Market on a whim and will continue to buy this! :)</li>
            <li>I used this to pick blueberries in the hot Florida sun for over 2 hours and it worked nicely!</li>
            <li>My face 40SPF has 12% zinc, a better formula</li>
            <li>may offer protection but offer many unwanted chemicals as well.</li>
            <li>ZO is insoluble in water, used in many industries, in ointments, creams and lotions.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>its more expensive.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The product popped up as a biodegradable reef safe product.</li>
            <li>I love this for days</li>
            <li>my favorite sunscreen.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m allergic to regular sunscreen and found this to be the best product for my condition.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>Love this sunblock, feels like lotion rather than sunscreen</li>
            <li>Love this sunblock.</li>
            <li>Otherwise it is OK</li>
            <li>This is pretty much the perfect sunscreen.</li>
            <li>I use many brands and I will not use Target&#x27;s formula but there are many other brands out there with good ingredients and great protection.</li>
            <li>Got this for my 6 month old to avoid chemicals, and it works great.  </li>
            <li>Many sunscreen manufacturers cheap out when it comes to those additional skin nutrients.</li>
            <li>This one has been great to far.</li>
            <li>I use this just on my face - and it&#x27;s kept my face from burning every time and I burn super easy!</li>
            <li>Easy to put on</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to spread on squirmy kids.</li>
            <li>Spreads fairly easily.</li>
            <li>Protects from sunburn and easy to rub in.</li>
            <li>has worked well for me, wipes on easy</li>
            <li>It rubs in easily and does the job.</li>
            <li>I am glad I found a all natural product  that delivers good skin coverage.</li>
            <li>Extremely strong chemical smell while putting it on.  </li>
            <li>I use a full coverage foundation, so I always mix this moisturizer in with my foundation so that it all blends more easily.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good if you sniff it but mostly negligible but not gross like many sunscreens.</li>
            <li>I trust this sunscreen does the job of blocking harmful sun&#x27;s rays just fine.</li>
            <li>A great, everyday sunscreen that absorbs nicely and can be easily worn under makeup.  </li>
            <li>But after a week of wearing this sunscreen every day and being rash free I think that theory is dispelled and I&#x27;ll be a loyal Kiss My Face customer for life!</li>
            <li>thought this would be great for daily use</li>
            <li>I know what is important in a face sunscreen.....</li>
            <li>and i have light skin tone.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It went on smoothly and did not leave oily residue.</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth and blends in.</li>
            <li>Blends in quickly and smoothly.</li>
            <li>I love using this on my face, not irritating at all.</li>
            <li>It goes on good, you don&#x27;t end up looking like you rubbed white paint on your face, and you&#x27;re not that oily after you apply.</li>
            <li>30spf is good enough for me.</li>
            <li>(does come out a little fast), seems to give great coverage (she never got burned!), and no skin reactions.  </li>
            <li>and I use it too quickly</li>
            <li>look for kid friendly products like banana boat kids with 7% physical blockers, effective and will not sting.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t really have strong smell either</li>
            <li>But I purchased it because it said it had no artificial fragrances.</li>
            <li>Not greasy even when you slather it on (which you should, sunscreens are supposed to be applied in the proper amount to be effective).</li>
            <li>I have super sensitive skin that will break out easily with almost every sunscreen out there.  </li>
            <li>I wear this as an every day sunscreen on my face, and, while it goes on more easily than lots of other sunscreens I&#x27;ve used, it still makes my face look shiny.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s a nice thick cream that goes on easily and absorbs quickly.  </li>
            <li>The first day I used this I was carrying some heavy bags on a warm day, so I was bound to sweat, but though the rest of me was mildly damp my face was DRIPPING sweat!</li>
            <li>This sunscreen doesn&#x27;t affect my skin like that, plus it is the only one we could find that does not include the laundry list of gnarly chemicals that most sunscreens contain.  </li>
            <li>Arrived pretty fast!</li>
            <li>It leaves the skin soft and smooth and not tacky at all.  </li>
            <li>Whether I use it straight out of the tube or blend it with a non-sunscreen moisturizer, this is a keeper in the winter for me!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very moisturizing so a great choice for those harsh winter months!</li>
            <li>Fabulous natural alternative.  </li>
            <li>I wound up purchasing this elsewhere for a lower price, but felt compelled to write a review because FINALLY I found a safe, mineral, non-toxic sunscreen that would smear in easily and not turn my face white.</li>
            <li>Since I have Rosacea I always use a sunscreen of 30 or above when I leave the house, while any GOOD sunscreen will have a white cast, to solve that issue</li>
            <li>The thing that is great about this stuff, compared to some other non-toxic brands - is this does not leave any streaks or make your face white, like I&#x27;ve had before.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s done a good job of keeping those rough dry patches on my nose calm.</li>
            <li>I really like this sunscreen - it&#x27;s non-toxic and does its job of blocking out the suns rays.</li>
            <li>I really like this brand</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much easier on my face while not having harmful chemical ingredients.</li>
            <li>, that is a whole world by itself.</li>
            <li>Oxide is a physical sunscreen rather than a chemical one, blocks both UVA (320-400 nm) and UVB (280-320 nm) rays of ultraviolet light.</li>
            <li>/&gt;SPF is a measure of how much longer someone will be protected from UVB rays than someone wearing no cream.</li>
            <li>Producers write whatever they want and it really consumes time to read up and compare facts.</li>
            <li>Producers write whatever they want and it really consumes time to read up and compare facts.</li>
            <li>I really like this and use it every day.</li>
            <li>I really like the way that this sunscreen feels and smells.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve become really bothered by perfumes in products.</li>
            <li>This one was much cheaper</li>
            <li>and I have not broken out using this</li>
            <li>Fast shipping</li>
            <li>Really like the consistency of this.</li>
            <li>I see that many other reviewers have said it is very runny and pours out too fast; perhaps Kiss</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t really have a smell that I could tell, it goes on super smooth and spreads easily, and it doesn&#x27;t leave an obnoxious white cast like other natural sunscreens I&#x27;ve tried like Goddess Garden.</li>
            <li>This one, though: I suppose it blocks the sun&#x27;s rays, but it feels less like moisturizer and more like a plastic bag on my skin.</li>
            <li>Zinc is the solution, more zinc for less money with organic ingredients that are not carcinogen or harmful to me...</li>
            <li>in order to protect my skin and control the needed ingredient which is zinc oxide, I make my own sunscreen since I double the amount of zinc where I apply it on my nose and more importantly costs me less with only few USDA organic ingredients as well.he cost...</li>

            <li>/&gt;Environmental working group a non-profit organization that protects consumers rated it highly.  </li>
            <li>This is well above average on both counts and has a nice, creamy consistency that blends well and doesn&#x27;t leave my face overly shiny.</li>
            <li>What I put on my skin is the same as consuming it through my skin since it is absorbed by my skin.</li>

            <li>And, most importantly, no allergic reaction.</li>
            <li>pretty much the only sunscreen I use on my face -</li>
            <li>Normal &amp;#34;unnatural&amp;#34</li>
            <li>Make sure your sunscreen is all natural and not full of chemicals.</li>
            <li>I found this sunscreen via Beautypedia as the best sunscreen for sensitive skin, as I have a strong tendency to break out in a terrible rash, to the point where I thought I might have a sunscreen allergy.  </li>
            <li>Very pleased that a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li>The fragrance especially in this sunscreen was a definite &amp;#34;yuck&amp;#34; when I used it but fairly light.</li>
            <li>I wore it all day yesterday in direct sunlight kayaking and sunbathing on the beach and no burns!</li>
            <li>Usually those SPFs will not be over 30 for any safe sunscreen ingredients and it will be for BABYs.</li>
            <li>Usually those SPFs will not be over 30 for any safe sunscreen ingredients and it will be for BABYs.</li>
            <li>The first sun sunscreen that doesn&#x27;t burn or leave my skin oily or white.</li>
            <li>ZO must be NON NANO / UNCOATED UPS -2 ZO which has a mean particle size greater than 30nm, when applied to the skin do not get absorbed into the body, do not enter the bloodstream, and are not a threat to human health.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Non-irritating, non-allergenic and non-comedogenic, used by athletes as a bandage to prevent soft tissue damage during workouts.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive oily skin.</li>
            <li>Sinks right in.</li>
            <li>in order to protect my skin and control the needed ingredient which is zinc oxide, I make my own sunscreen since I double the amount of zinc where I apply it on my nose and more importantly costs me less with only few USDA organic ingredients as well.br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sunscreens are worse than processed foods (which I never consume) since there is no nutritional guide for sunscreens.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty effective too, but don&#x27;t be lazy like me and not reapply on days when you&#x27;re riding a bike for a few hours (drivers hands!).</li>
            <li>Love this stuff - easy to spread on the skin and doesn&#x27;t have any of the bad ingredients they tell you to look out for.</li>
            <li>Goes on easily, not thick, with no white streaks.</li>
            <li>Hardly any zinc in this formula, only 3% and more unneeded ingredients.</li>
            <li>Use on hands and feet ,No white film ,easy to wash off ,no strong scent ,next year i will buy this brand again .</li>
            <li>I have extra Sensitive Skin</li>
            <li>and I never had a single sunburn, which might be a first for me in a sunny vacation spot, being a fair-skinned northern european blonde.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this product for several years, after Paula Begoun (&amp;#34;The Cosmetics Cop&amp;#34;) recommended it due to its combination of sun protection and skin-nourishing factors (i.e., anti-oxidants, etc.)</li>
            <li>I like this particular one because there is 4 ounces, vs the other one I used to buy - that is 2 oz</li>
            <li>The lotion is thick but absorbs quickly and wears well beneath makeup.</li>
            <li>I am african american with dark brown skin and this works very well.</li>
            <li>Chemical sunscreens are less effective and carry unnecessary health risks.</li>
            <li>This rubs in clear and does not feel greasy, but if it gets wet, it starts to run and we get white streaks.</li>

            <li> The texture is nice - goes on smooth.</li>
            <li> Great Product, I really recomend it</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> This one is better.</li>
            <li> If I weren&#x27;t so broke I would buy something more matte.</li>
            <li> Much better than the top selling brands.</li>
            <li> In fact, the skin on my arms is looking more supple and moisturized.</li>
            <li> :)  </li>
            <li> I got this on Thrive Market on a whim and will continue to buy this! :)</li>
            <li> I used this to pick blueberries in the hot Florida sun for over 2 hours and it worked nicely!</li>
            <li> My face 40SPF has 12% zinc, a better formula</li>
            <li> may offer protection but offer many unwanted chemicals as well.</li>
            <li> ZO is insoluble in water, used in many industries, in ointments, creams and lotions.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> its more expensive.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The product popped up as a biodegradable reef safe product.</li>
            <li> I love this for days</li>
            <li> my favorite sunscreen.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m allergic to regular sunscreen and found this to be the best product for my condition.</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> Love this sunblock, feels like lotion rather than sunscreen</li>
            <li> Love this sunblock.</li>
            <li> Otherwise it is OK</li>
            <li> This is pretty much the perfect sunscreen.</li>
            <li> I use many brands and I will not use Target&#x27;s formula but there are many other brands out there with good ingredients and great protection.</li>
            <li> Got this for my 6 month old to avoid chemicals, and it works great.  </li>
            <li> Many sunscreen manufacturers cheap out when it comes to those additional skin nutrients.</li>
            <li> This one has been great to far.</li>
            <li> I use this just on my face - and it&#x27;s kept my face from burning every time and I burn super easy!</li>
            <li> Easy to put on</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to spread on squirmy kids.</li>
            <li> Spreads fairly easily.</li>
            <li> Protects from sunburn and easy to rub in.</li>
            <li> has worked well for me, wipes on easy</li>
            <li> It rubs in easily and does the job.</li>
            <li> I am glad I found a all natural product  that delivers good skin coverage.</li>
            <li> Extremely strong chemical smell while putting it on.  </li>
            <li> I use a full coverage foundation, so I always mix this moisturizer in with my foundation so that it all blends more easily.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good if you sniff it but mostly negligible but not gross like many sunscreens.</li>
            <li> I trust this sunscreen does the job of blocking harmful sun&#x27;s rays just fine.</li>
            <li> A great, everyday sunscreen that absorbs nicely and can be easily worn under makeup.  </li>
            <li> But after a week of wearing this sunscreen every day and being rash free I think that theory is dispelled and I&#x27;ll be a loyal Kiss My Face customer for life!</li>
            <li> thought this would be great for daily use</li>
            <li> I know what is important in a face sunscreen.....</li>
            <li> and i have light skin tone.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It went on smoothly and did not leave oily residue.</li>
            <li> It goes on smooth and blends in.</li>
            <li> Blends in quickly and smoothly.</li>
            <li> I love using this on my face, not irritating at all.</li>
            <li> It goes on good, you don&#x27;t end up looking like you rubbed white paint on your face, and you&#x27;re not that oily after you apply.</li>
            <li> 30spf is good enough for me.</li>
            <li> (does come out a little fast), seems to give great coverage (she never got burned!), and no skin reactions.  </li>
            <li> and I use it too quickly</li>
            <li> look for kid friendly products like banana boat kids with 7% physical blockers, effective and will not sting.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really have strong smell either</li>
            <li> But I purchased it because it said it had no artificial fragrances.</li>
            <li> Not greasy even when you slather it on (which you should, sunscreens are supposed to be applied in the proper amount to be effective).</li>
            <li> I have super sensitive skin that will break out easily with almost every sunscreen out there.  </li>
            <li> I wear this as an every day sunscreen on my face, and, while it goes on more easily than lots of other sunscreens I&#x27;ve used, it still makes my face look shiny.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s a nice thick cream that goes on easily and absorbs quickly.  </li>
            <li> The first day I used this I was carrying some heavy bags on a warm day, so I was bound to sweat, but though the rest of me was mildly damp my face was DRIPPING sweat!</li>
            <li> This sunscreen doesn&#x27;t affect my skin like that, plus it is the only one we could find that does not include the laundry list of gnarly chemicals that most sunscreens contain.  </li>
            <li> Arrived pretty fast!</li>
            <li> It leaves the skin soft and smooth and not tacky at all.  </li>
            <li> Whether I use it straight out of the tube or blend it with a non-sunscreen moisturizer, this is a keeper in the winter for me!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very moisturizing so a great choice for those harsh winter months!</li>
            <li> Fabulous natural alternative.  </li>
            <li> I wound up purchasing this elsewhere for a lower price, but felt compelled to write a review because FINALLY I found a safe, mineral, non-toxic sunscreen that would smear in easily and not turn my face white.</li>
            <li> Since I have Rosacea I always use a sunscreen of 30 or above when I leave the house, while any GOOD sunscreen will have a white cast, to solve that issue</li>
            <li> The thing that is great about this stuff, compared to some other non-toxic brands - is this does not leave any streaks or make your face white, like I&#x27;ve had before.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s done a good job of keeping those rough dry patches on my nose calm.</li>
            <li> I really like this sunscreen - it&#x27;s non-toxic and does its job of blocking out the suns rays.</li>
            <li> I really like this brand</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much easier on my face while not having harmful chemical ingredients.</li>
            <li> , that is a whole world by itself.</li>
            <li> Oxide is a physical sunscreen rather than a chemical one, blocks both UVA (320-400 nm) and UVB (280-320 nm) rays of ultraviolet light.</li>
            <li> /&gt;SPF is a measure of how much longer someone will be protected from UVB rays than someone wearing no cream.</li>
            <li> Producers write whatever they want and it really consumes time to read up and compare facts.</li>
            <li> Producers write whatever they want and it really consumes time to read up and compare facts.</li>
            <li> I really like this and use it every day.</li>
            <li> I really like the way that this sunscreen feels and smells.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve become really bothered by perfumes in products.</li>
            <li> This one was much cheaper</li>
            <li> and I have not broken out using this</li>
            <li> Fast shipping</li>
            <li> Really like the consistency of this.</li>
            <li> I see that many other reviewers have said it is very runny and pours out too fast; perhaps Kiss</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t really have a smell that I could tell, it goes on super smooth and spreads easily, and it doesn&#x27;t leave an obnoxious white cast like other natural sunscreens I&#x27;ve tried like Goddess Garden.</li>
            <li> This one, though: I suppose it blocks the sun&#x27;s rays, but it feels less like moisturizer and more like a plastic bag on my skin.</li>
            <li> Zinc is the solution, more zinc for less money with organic ingredients that are not carcinogen or harmful to me...</li>
            <li> in order to protect my skin and control the needed ingredient which is zinc oxide, I make my own sunscreen since I double the amount of zinc where I apply it on my nose and more importantly costs me less with only few USDA organic ingredients as well.he cost...</li>

            <li> /&gt;Environmental working group a non-profit organization that protects consumers rated it highly.  </li>
            <li> This is well above average on both counts and has a nice, creamy consistency that blends well and doesn&#x27;t leave my face overly shiny.</li>
            <li> What I put on my skin is the same as consuming it through my skin since it is absorbed by my skin.</li>
            <li> What I put on my skin is the same as consuming it through my skin since it is absorbed by my skin.</li>
            <li> And, most importantly, no allergic reaction.</li>
            <li> pretty much the only sunscreen I use on my face -</li>
            <li> Normal &amp;#34;unnatural&amp;#34</li>
            <li> Make sure your sunscreen is all natural and not full of chemicals.</li>
            <li> I found this sunscreen via Beautypedia as the best sunscreen for sensitive skin, as I have a strong tendency to break out in a terrible rash, to the point where I thought I might have a sunscreen allergy.  </li>
            <li> Very pleased that a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> The fragrance especially in this sunscreen was a definite &amp;#34;yuck&amp;#34; when I used it but fairly light.</li>
            <li> I wore it all day yesterday in direct sunlight kayaking and sunbathing on the beach and no burns!</li>
            <li> Usually those SPFs will not be over 30 for any safe sunscreen ingredients and it will be for BABYs.</li>
            <li> Usually those SPFs will not be over 30 for any safe sunscreen ingredients and it will be for BABYs.</li>
            <li> The first sun sunscreen that doesn&#x27;t burn or leave my skin oily or white.</li>
            <li> ZO must be NON NANO / UNCOATED UPS -2 ZO which has a mean particle size greater than 30nm, when applied to the skin do not get absorbed into the body, do not enter the bloodstream, and are not a threat to human health.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Non-irritating, non-allergenic and non-comedogenic, used by athletes as a bandage to prevent soft tissue damage during workouts.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive oily skin.</li>
            <li> Sinks right in.</li>
            <li> in order to protect my skin and control the needed ingredient which is zinc oxide, I make my own sunscreen since I double the amount of zinc where I apply it on my nose and more importantly costs me less with only few USDA organic ingredients as well.br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sunscreens are worse than processed foods (which I never consume) since there is no nutritional guide for sunscreens.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty effective too, but don&#x27;t be lazy like me and not reapply on days when you&#x27;re riding a bike for a few hours (drivers hands!).</li>
            <li> Love this stuff - easy to spread on the skin and doesn&#x27;t have any of the bad ingredients they tell you to look out for.</li>
            <li> Goes on easily, not thick, with no white streaks.</li>
            <li> Hardly any zinc in this formula, only 3% and more unneeded ingredients.</li>
            <li> Use on hands and feet ,No white film ,easy to wash off ,no strong scent ,next year i will buy this brand again .</li>
            <li> I have extra Sensitive Skin</li>
            <li> and I never had a single sunburn, which might be a first for me in a sunny vacation spot, being a fair-skinned northern european blonde.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this product for several years, after Paula Begoun (&amp;#34;The Cosmetics Cop&amp;#34;) recommended it due to its combination of sun protection and skin-nourishing factors (i.e., anti-oxidants, etc.)</li>
            <li> I like this particular one because there is 4 ounces, vs the other one I used to buy - that is 2 oz</li>
            <li> The lotion is thick but absorbs quickly and wears well beneath makeup.</li>
            <li> I am african american with dark brown skin and this works very well.</li>
            <li> Chemical sunscreens are less effective and carry unnecessary health risks.</li>
            <li> This rubs in clear and does not feel greasy, but if it gets wet, it starts to run and we get white streaks.</li>
            <li> and she would rash out with other brands of sun screen at a young age.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t last too long for a family of 3!</li>
            <li> A lot of other sunscreens that don&#x27;t have problematic/flagged ingredients are difficult to spread on - but this one is different and easy to lather on your skin.</li>
            <li> as I have dry skin.</li>
            <li> It is a little thick right when you put it on, but it absorbs well and doesn&#x27;t feel to greasy to me.</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;d almost rather have the old fruity, &amp;#34;summer&amp;#34; smell of sunscreens of decades past.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not super white</li>
            <li> After using previous sunscreens for the face, i would break out in a heat rash afterwards that would last 3-4 days.</li>
            <li> I just happen to be a baby who tries to read ingredients.</li>
            <li> I just happen to be a baby who tries to read ingredients.</li>
            <li> Be careful,  </li>
            <li> The price for 3 is less (slightly) than the price for 3 by a different seller at Amazon that I have used.</li>
            <li> I put it on and other moisturize too...</li>
            <li> and i break out with a lot of other sun screens.</li>
            <li> For a small investment, sunscreens may offer me the possibility of avoiding sun burn, pain, cancer, medical bills, pain killers, etc.</li>
            <li> For a small investment, sunscreens may offer me the possibility of avoiding sun burn, pain, cancer, medical bills, pain killers, etc.</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t cause any problems like some other products I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> The other KissMyFace Face Factor Sunscreen doesn&#x27;t feel like that</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t speak to any of its other &amp;#34;miraculous&amp;#34; promises, but</li>
            <li> I like this product for my hands and other exposed areas during the summer.</li>
            <li> This will be my go to face sunscreen when my other stuff runs out.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it runs off in the water.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend stocking up on this - bad sun burns even one time can cause major repurcussions.</li>
            <li> Vanicream 30 and 35 have less zinc</li>
            <li> I will be staying dry because it doesn&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m wearing thick sunblock</li>
            <li> This little $8 sunscreen can compete with the $40 mall sunscreens.</li>
            <li> I can see a little film of sunscreen on the water when I&#x27;m sitting on a raft in the pool.</li>
            <li> The EU recommendation is for sunscreens to offer a UVA protection factor that is a third of their SPF.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sunscreens are worse than processed foods (which I never consume) since there is no nutritional guide for sunscreens.</li>
            <li> I will use this everyday.</li>
            <li> This is one of the few sun screens that doesn&#x27;t leave my skin grayish or like I have on sun screen.  </li>
            <li> Does the job without harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li> I have been using this brand for a few years now and have never been burned while using.</li>
            <li> but if I sweat even a little bit it feels like I have a thick film on my skin.</li>
            <li> Bought this instead of my usual Aveeno face sunscreen, which feels like a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> It also seems to make my skin feel cold when a breeze or fan blows on me which is a little strange.</li>
            <li> (Kiss My Face Sun Screen with Oat Protein Complex, SPF 30, 4 Ounce Tube)  </li>
            <li> And it is non irritating to my skin.</li>
            <li> While UVB rays are behind the redness of sunburn, UVA rays damage the skin&#x27;s DNA at a deeper layer.</li>
            <li> It sounds crazy, but it&#x27;s hard to describe the feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> so those are worthless, unless if you want to go by what Consumer Report recommends which rates protection without any consideration for ingredients in the sunscreen then in that case, I can get roofing tar for less money, so we might as well consider that...</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s still not perfect.</li>
            <li> not impressed, as a swimmer</li>
            <li> but unfortunately it comes with 6% titanium.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It feels like my skin is suffocating.</li>
            <li> but I failed to do so.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have a lot of the nasty ingredients that other sunscreens do.</li>
            <li> but unless it&#x27;s cold out, I don&#x27;t see myself using this again.</li>
            <li> (Sorry, farmers!</li>
            <li> no stinging the eyes,  you are miserable if you are not enjoying your activity because of that.  </li>
            <li> Caused me to break out with eczema on my hands and legs AND sunburned my shoulders really badly.  </li>
            <li> When the sun comes in contact with the chemicals in sunscreen it can have a bad reaction to your face and/or body.</li>
            <li> It was annoying and embarrassing.</li>
            <li> but the sensation just feels terrible.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Love this-not greasy, it&#x27;s lightweight-will buy again!</li>
            <li> I have super sensitive skin that will break out easily with almost every sunscreen out there.  This sunscreen doesn&#x27;t affect my skin like that, plus it is the only one we could find that does not include the laundry list of gnarly chemicals that most sunscreens contain.  Doesn&#x27;t feel greasy when on, doesn&#x27;t leave you looking like a big white ghost.  This is pretty much the perfect sunscreen.</li>
            <li> Shipped quickly, was in great condition. I use this moisturizer/sunscreen every day with my makeup. I use a full coverage foundation, so I always mix this moisturizer in with my foundation so that it all blends more easily. It&#x27;s been very kind to my face and it&#x27;s done a good job of keeping those rough dry patches on my nose calm. Overall very happy with the product and the shipping/buying experience!</li>
            <li> No white residue. Goes on easily, not thick, with no white streaks. Smell is neutral, its a simple product that works for sun protection. I use on arms, hands and chest.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t let the low price fool you! This little $8 sunscreen can compete with the $40 mall sunscreens. I almost didn&#x27;t buy it, but it turned out to be a good find! A great, everyday sunscreen that absorbs nicely and can be easily worn under makeup.  Even my teen girls like wearing it, which makes me happy!</li>
            <li> Love these products as they have fewer chemicals and seem just as effective!</li>
            <li> I love using this on my face, not irritating at all. Arrived pretty fast!</li>
            <li> Great product because it&#x27;s Oxybenzone free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Environmental working group a non-profit organization that protects consumers rated it highly.  EWG says to avoid all oxybenzone products</li>
            <li> This is the only brand of sun screen i will buy from now on. My youngest daughter had problems with her skin and she would rash out with other brands of sun screen at a young age. We tried all the &amp;#34;baby&amp;#34; brands but this one was the one that never caused her any issues. It goes on good, you don&#x27;t end up looking like you rubbed white paint on your face, and you&#x27;re not that oily after you apply. I love it.</li>
            <li> Excellent formula that goes smoothly and protect from the sun. Gives really good sun protection!</li>
            <li> Three girls and me using this product.  Works great, would recommend to family and friends.  Very pleased that a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> Got this for my 6 month old to avoid chemicals, and it works great.  Easy to put on (does come out a little fast), seems to give great coverage (she never got burned!), and no skin reactions.  Bought a second bottle so we could stash it in the diaper bag for all summer outings.</li>
            <li> I really like this sunscreen - it&#x27;s non-toxic and does its job of blocking out the suns rays. The texture is nice - goes on smooth. I really like this brand - Kiss my Face - and also buy their toothpaste regularly. The thing that is great about this stuff, compared to some other non-toxic brands - is this does not leave any streaks or make your face white, like I&#x27;ve had before. This has never done that for me. I put it on and other moisturize too...as I have dry skin. Then, if putting on makeup - do that next. I like this particular one because there is 4 ounces, vs the other one I used to buy - that is 2 oz and I use it too quickly and it&#x27;s pricier than this one.</li>
            <li> Great Product, I really recomend it</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It is the only sunscreen for my face that I have found that does not irritate my perioral dermatitis.  I have even used it as a moisturizer at night when I was on vacation and had forgotten to pack any.  It leaves the skin soft and smooth and not tacky at all.  Absorbs well.</li>
            <li> I wear this as an every day sunscreen on my face, and, while it goes on more easily than lots of other sunscreens I&#x27;ve used, it still makes my face look shiny. I have to blot off the excess film or I look like I&#x27;m made of glass or something. I don&#x27;t like that. But it&#x27;s honestly the best sunscreen for its price that I&#x27;ve used. I tried Face Factor, and that is WAY to greasy and shiny. This one is better. But it&#x27;s still not perfect. If I weren&#x27;t so broke I would buy something more matte.</li>
            <li> Much better than the top selling brands. It&#x27;s much easier on my face while not having harmful chemical ingredients. I&#x27;ve switched to using this sunscreen exclusively for all my outdoor activities and travels to tropical countries.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for several years, after Paula Begoun (&amp;#34;The Cosmetics Cop&amp;#34;) recommended it due to its combination of sun protection and skin-nourishing factors (i.e., anti-oxidants, etc.) Many sunscreen manufacturers cheap out when it comes to those additional skin nutrients. This is well above average on both counts and has a nice, creamy consistency that blends well and doesn&#x27;t leave my face overly shiny. While KMF does make a &amp;#34;Face Factor&amp;#34; version that&#x27;s costlier, this has the same ingredients and does the same job and is the cheaper way to go.</li>
            <li> I have extra Sensitive Skin and I love this! (Kiss My Face Sun Screen with Oat Protein Complex, SPF 30, 4 Ounce Tube)  It works great, it&#x27;s a nice thick cream that goes on easily and absorbs quickly.  Since I have Rosacea I always use a sunscreen of 30 or above when I leave the house, while any GOOD sunscreen will have a white cast, to solve that issue I just blend it with my Paula&#x27;s Choice Retinol Body Cream, cuts the cast a bit but still provides ample sunscreen protection.  Whether I use it straight out of the tube or blend it with a non-sunscreen moisturizer, this is a keeper in the winter for me!  It&#x27;s very moisturizing so a great choice for those harsh winter months!</li>
            <li> Caused me to break out with eczema on my hands and legs AND sunburned my shoulders really badly.  My legs and arms did not burn, but my shoulders sunburned after liberally applying this product prior to a hike. Throwing it away.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if this was made to be used on the face only, but I have been using it on my arms to avoid a summer &amp;#34;farmer tan&amp;#34;. (Sorry, farmers! No offense...). It applies and covers well, there is no odor or greasiness. And it is non irritating to my skin. In fact, the skin on my arms is looking more supple and moisturized. I have not tried it on my face - use another product for that. Would buy it again.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and i break out with a lot of other sun screens. This one has been great to far.</li>
            <li> Bought this instead of my usual Aveeno face sunscreen, which feels like a moisturizer. This one, though: I suppose it blocks the sun&#x27;s rays, but it feels less like moisturizer and more like a plastic bag on my skin. The first day I used this I was carrying some heavy bags on a warm day, so I was bound to sweat, but though the rest of me was mildly damp my face was DRIPPING sweat! It sounds crazy, but it&#x27;s hard to describe the feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought this would be great for daily use but unless it&#x27;s cold out, I don&#x27;t see myself using this again.</li>
            <li> This may be only the second product review I&#x27;ve ever written. This is absolutely the best sunscreen I&#x27;ve ever had. The best thing about it is that it doesn&#x27;t feel like sunscreen AT ALL. It goes on with the consistency of a regular lotion. It doesn&#x27;t smell (which is a big deal for some people in our household).  It doesn&#x27;t leave white traces everywhere. It&#x27;s easy to spread on squirmy kids. It doesn&#x27;t have a lot of the nasty ingredients that other sunscreens do. GREAT PRODUCT. I stocked up.</li>
            <li> great product - great protection and absorbs into your skin with reasonable application effort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;great company - environmentally friendly / no animal testing!!!</li>
            <li> not impressed, as a swimmer I know what is important in a face sunscreen.....no stinging the eyes,  you are miserable if you are not enjoying your activity because of that.  look for kid friendly products like banana boat kids with 7% physical blockers, effective and will not sting.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen is awesome and it doesn&#x27;t even feel like a sunscreen; it feels like lotion! I wore it all day yesterday in direct sunlight kayaking and sunbathing on the beach and no burns! :)  it doesn&#x27;t really have a smell that I could tell, it goes on super smooth and spreads easily, and it doesn&#x27;t leave an obnoxious white cast like other natural sunscreens I&#x27;ve tried like Goddess Garden. I got this on Thrive Market on a whim and will continue to buy this! :)</li>
            <li> I use this just on my face - and it&#x27;s kept my face from burning every time and I burn super easy! I was outside for 1.5 hrs applied this to my face and it&#x27;s not super white but there is some color (not red)Where I applied no sunscreen -- I am super burned!! This is my favorite sunscreen ever!! Time for more!</li>
            <li> I used this to pick blueberries in the hot Florida sun for over 2 hours and it worked nicely! It will definitely be an addition to my sun screen collection when I go to the beach!</li>
            <li> Hardly any zinc in this formula, only 3% and more unneeded ingredients. Kiss My Face has the best soap but forget about the sunscreens, that is a whole world by itself. Kiss My face 40SPF has 12% zinc, a better formula but unfortunately it comes with 6% titanium.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Check out the 2013 reports and you will find out that this did not offer protection in compare to the Target brand regardless of all their claims and all their good ingredients... I use many brands and I will not use Target&#x27;s formula but there are many other brands out there with good ingredients and great protection. Target, Hawaiian Tropic, Copper tone, etc. may offer protection but offer many unwanted chemicals as well. Bottom line, what ingredients are you looking for and how well it protects you for what you pay per ounce.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Zinc Oxide is a physical sunscreen rather than a chemical one, blocks both UVA (320-400 nm) and UVB (280-320 nm) rays of ultraviolet light. Chemical sunscreens are less effective and carry unnecessary health risks. ZO is insoluble in water, used in many industries, in ointments, creams and lotions. Non-irritating, non-allergenic and non-comedogenic, used by athletes as a bandage to prevent soft tissue damage during workouts. ZO must be NON NANO / UNCOATED UPS -2 ZO which has a mean particle size greater than 30nm, when applied to the skin do not get absorbed into the body, do not enter the bloodstream, and are not a threat to human health.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SPF is a measure of how much longer someone will be protected from UVB rays than someone wearing no cream. If the sun reddens unprotected skin in ten minutes, for example, a person wearing SPF15 can be exposed to the sun without reddening for 15 times longer - 150 minutes. While UVB rays are behind the redness of sunburn, UVA rays damage the skin&#x27;s DNA at a deeper layer. Both radiation types can cause skin cancer. The EU recommendation is for sunscreens to offer a UVA protection factor that is a third of their SPF.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sunscreens are worse than processed foods (which I never consume) since there is no nutritional guide for sunscreens. Producers write whatever they want and it really consumes time to read up and compare facts. Unless you happen to be a marathon swimmer who is going to be soaked for hour and hours in the oceans&#x27; salty water without any shade, which Vaseline will act as the best sealer there is, then for a surfer like me, usually higher organic ingredients are the best. What I put on my skin is the same as consuming it through my skin since it is absorbed by my skin. I don&#x27;t intend to have the sunscreen for snack but it is good to know that there are fewer chemicals in the sunscreen. Usually those SPFs will not be over 30 for any safe sunscreen ingredients and it will be for BABYs. I just happen to be a baby who tries to read ingredients. I wear a rash guard when surfing which covers my upper body so I am protected all the time. What worries me is my face. For a small investment, sunscreens may offer me the possibility of avoiding sun burn, pain, cancer, medical bills, pain killers, etc. that come with exposure to the sun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now in order to protect my skin and control the needed ingredient which is zinc oxide, I make my own sunscreen since I double the amount of zinc where I apply it on my nose and more importantly costs me less with only few USDA organic ingredients as well.br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sunscreens are worse than processed foods (which I never consume) since there is no nutritional guide for sunscreens.

Vanicream 30 and 35 have less zinc so those are worthless, unless if you want to go by what Consumer Report recommends which rates protection without any consideration for ingredients in the sunscreen then in that case, I can get roofing tar for less money, so we might as well consider that... Zinc is the solution, more zinc for less money with organic ingredients that are not carcinogen or harmful to me...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now in order to protect my skin and control the needed ingredient which is zinc oxide, I make my own sunscreen since I double the amount of zinc where I apply it on my nose and more importantly costs me less with only few USDA organic ingredients as well.</li>
            <li> A lot of other sunscreens that don&#x27;t have problematic/flagged ingredients are difficult to spread on - but this one is different and easy to lather on your skin. I highly recommend stocking up on this - bad sun burns even one time can cause major repurcussions.</li>
            <li> I really like this and use it every day. I have oily skin and it doesn&#x27;t cause any problems like some other products I&#x27;ve used. No greasy feeling!</li>
            <li> I really like the way that this sunscreen feels and smells. It&#x27;s very light and not oily at all. My only complaint is that it runs off in the water. Visibly. I can see a little film of sunscreen on the water when I&#x27;m sitting on a raft in the pool. That said, I would suggest it for day-to-day use, but not for the water.</li>
            <li> Love it. The first sun sunscreen that doesn&#x27;t burn or leave my skin oily or white.</li>
            <li> I trust this sunscreen does the job of blocking harmful sun&#x27;s rays just fine. But I purchased it because it said it had no artificial fragrances. I&#x27;ve become really bothered by perfumes in products. The fragrance especially in this sunscreen was a definite &amp;#34;yuck&amp;#34; when I used it but fairly light. I was hoping it would go away as the day wore on. If it had disappeared after a short time, I&#x27;d just deal with it. But it lingered - and LINGERED. Ugh! Certainly a personal reaction. I think I&#x27;d almost rather have the old fruity, &amp;#34;summer&amp;#34; smell of sunscreens of decades past. I&#x27;ll be &amp;#34;gifting&amp;#34; this sunscreen to my teenage niece.</li>
            <li> Really happy with this product. Not greasy and gives us the protection we need with added moisture. My only suggestion is to make it in a bigger bottle! Doesn&#x27;t last too long for a family of 3! After being in the sun all day, no burns! Would definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good. Blends in quickly and smoothly. No scent.</li>
            <li> I was using the KissMyFace Face Factor Sunscreen for Face&amp;Neck SPF 30, 2oz tube, which looks the same as this one but is in a smaller tube. This one was much cheaper so I purchased it thinking it would be similar but it is not. It does not leave a white residue but if I sweat even a little bit it feels like I have a thick film on my skin. It feels like my skin is suffocating. I have oily acne-prone skin and I have not broken out using this but the sensation just feels terrible. The other KissMyFace Face Factor Sunscreen doesn&#x27;t feel like that, I guess there&#x27;s a reason its more expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I returned the product and would not recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> The product popped up as a biodegradable reef safe product. I got it and read the ingredients and it contains stuff not recommended for use by reefs. I should have looked it up before purchasing but I failed to do so. My error there. Returned it</li>
            <li> Fabulous natural alternative.  Be careful,  it will leave a yellow stain on anything that is white.</li>
            <li> This rubs in clear and does not feel greasy, but if it gets wet, it starts to run and we get white streaks. I love this for days I will be staying dry because it doesn&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m wearing thick sunblock but I don&#x27;t reach for this at the pool or beach. It also seems to make my skin feel cold when a breeze or fan blows on me which is a little strange.</li>
            <li> works great did irritate my face.</li>
            <li> I liked the way this sunscreen wears. Not greasy even when you slather it on (which you should, sunscreens are supposed to be applied in the proper amount to be effective). It&#x27;s pretty effective too, but don&#x27;t be lazy like me and not reapply on days when you&#x27;re riding a bike for a few hours (drivers hands!). Especially on your hands since you wash those often (let&#x27;s hope). The smell is neutral. It&#x27;s good if you sniff it but mostly negligible but not gross like many sunscreens.</li>
            <li> this works wonderful! I didn&#x27;t burn at all and i have light skin tone. Fast shipping</li>
            <li> my favorite sunscreen.</li>
            <li> Not greasy. Spreads fairly easily. Stops peeling. And, most importantly, no allergic reaction. Consumer Report recommended.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not oily and suits me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m allergic to regular sunscreen and found this to be the best product for my condition. I often kayak and others in my group like this sunscreen too and often \\&quot;borrow\\&quot; mine.</li>
            <li> My second tube. Love this product. Does not sting the eyes.</li>
            <li> This is a great sunscreen. Protects from sunburn and easy to rub in.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen works great and all day too.</li>
            <li> Great. No fragrance. Sinks right in. My face feels like nothing is on it. I will use this everyday. Great product</li>
            <li> I wound up purchasing this elsewhere for a lower price, but felt compelled to write a review because FINALLY I found a safe, mineral, non-toxic sunscreen that would smear in easily and not turn my face white. I&#x27;m on board with this one. I can&#x27;t speak to any of its other &amp;#34;miraculous&amp;#34; promises, but if you&#x27;re looking for a mineral sunscreen that doesn&#x27;t make you look like a ghost, this is the one.</li>
            <li> This is one of the few sun screens that doesn&#x27;t leave my skin grayish or like I have on sun screen.  I am african american with dark brown skin and this works very well.</li>
            <li> Kids love it! They don&#x27;t complain about it being sticky.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Works better than any popular brands and is &amp;#34;natural.&amp;#34;  Your skin is supple after using it and it protects as directed.</li>
            <li> It took me a while to found a sunscreen that worked. I have sensitive oily skin. I am also very light skinned. After using previous sunscreens for the face, i would break out in a heat rash afterwards that would last 3-4 days. It was annoying and embarrassing. I am glad I found a all natural product  that delivers good skin coverage. That is the key with having heat rash. Make sure your sunscreen is all natural and not full of chemicals. When the sun comes in contact with the chemicals in sunscreen it can have a bad reaction to your face and/or body.</li>
            <li> pretty much the only sunscreen I use on my face - it works and it doesn&#x27;t give me break outs</li>
            <li> has worked well for me, wipes on easy, I don&#x27;t thing its sticky as some others have been, give it an A.</li>
            <li> The best for sensitive skin.  Use it every day.</li>
            <li> I like this product for my hands and other exposed areas during the summer.</li>
            <li> Does the job without harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li> This is a good product if you&#x27;re looking for a chemical-free sunscreen. It rubs in easily and does the job.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff - easy to spread on the skin and doesn&#x27;t have any of the bad ingredients they tell you to look out for.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent sunscreen.  It applies smoothly and is the perfect texture.  I see that many other reviewers have said it is very runny and pours out too fast; perhaps Kiss My Face has heard you and changed their formulation, as I never had that experience at all.  I found the texture to be on the thicker side of the sunscreen spectrum.  I was just in Mexico for a week and I never had a single sunburn, which might be a first for me in a sunny vacation spot, being a fair-skinned northern european blonde.  I found this sunscreen via Beautypedia as the best sunscreen for sensitive skin, as I have a strong tendency to break out in a terrible rash, to the point where I thought I might have a sunscreen allergy.  But after a week of wearing this sunscreen every day and being rash free I think that theory is dispelled and I&#x27;ll be a loyal Kiss My Face customer for life!</li>
            <li> This product has worked perfectly as a daily facial moisturizer and sunscreen. The lotion is thick but absorbs quickly and wears well beneath makeup.</li>
            <li> Love this sunblock, feels like lotion rather than sunscreen</li>
            <li> Use on hands and feet ,No white film ,easy to wash off ,no strong scent ,next year i will buy this brand again .</li>
            <li> I love this product!  No animal testing and no chemical junk in the lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It went on smoothly and did not leave oily residue.</li>
            <li> Love this sunblock. It goes on smooth and blends in.</li>
            <li> Never got burned while traveling in central america for a month this last summer. I have been using this brand for a few years now and have never been burned while using.</li>
            <li> The sunscreen was delivered in 2 days as promised. The price for 3 is less (slightly) than the price for 3 by a different seller at Amazon that I have used. The Amazon Prime price when shipping is included is competitive. Great product. Normal &amp;#34;unnatural&amp;#34; sun screen gives me a rash, this doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Really like the consistency of this. It is a little thick right when you put it on, but it absorbs well and doesn&#x27;t feel to greasy to me. 30spf is good enough for me. This will be my go to face sunscreen when my other stuff runs out. Doesn&#x27;t really have strong smell either so thats good too.</li>
            <li> Extremely strong chemical smell while putting it on.  Otherwise it is OK</li>
    </ol>
