            <li>Makes great curls and great price!</li>
            <li>This does a great job.</li>
            <li>Great curling iron.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been happy with everything I have.</li>
            <li>Great item.</li>
            <li>I ordered this based on online research and i am so happy with it. .</li>
            <li>Great price and product.  </li>
            <li>They come out great</li>
            <li>This is amazing just like I thought it would be!</li>
            <li>, good cord</li>
            <li>and it didn&#x27;t do a good job of curling.</li>
            <li>and I loved it...</li>
            <li>It works so good.</li>
            <li>Heats up great and a very easy to use handle.</li>
            <li>Besides that I love this hair tool!</li>
            <li>I love this curling iron!</li>
            <li>The glove comes in handy, so I&#x27;m glad it was included!</li>
            <li>This product is amazing.</li>
            <li>You put your hair through it and within 3 seconds, its nicely shaped.</li>
            <li>You can play around with the kind of shapes you want too, its not just the one kind of curl that you would get with the curling iron with clip.   </li>
            <li>My own curls change to become the shape of the curl the iron gives it, no hassle.</li>
            <li>I own a lot of Enzo Milano curling/flat irons.</li>
            <li>so you can plug in everywhere, easy to maintain, love love love it &lt;3</li>
            <li>However, the plastic that holds the cylinder together separated very easily.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for to create beautiful waves.</li>
            <li>Very quick shipping!</li>
            <li>the curling iron is simply one of the best ones ive ever used.</li>
            <li>I love the \\&quot;beachy\\</li>
            <li>I love the look this tool gives to my hair, but I would be completely in love with it if it had heat setting.</li>
            <li>Overall great product!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li>I ditched the glove because I felt that I can grip my hair sections better without it.</li>
            <li>I really love the Enzo Milano curling irons.</li>
            <li>LOVE</li>
            <li>While the light came on it did not heat up, ever!  </li>
            <li>and I love how it keeps the curls all day with no product in it.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>The curling iron is okay.</li>
            <li>It came on time and seems to work ok.</li>
            <li>This is such a awesome curling wand.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>, you get very quick at it.   </li>
            <li>you soo easily)</li>
            <li>As others have mentioned, it is easy to burn yourself.</li>
            <li>I bought one of the 19mm, and it heated up very quickly.</li>
            <li>Easy to use to make forward or backwards curls.</li>
            <li>and it works fine,</li>
            <li>It also sleek and light weight</li>
            <li>I ended up buying the same brand curling wand at a salon and it worked great.</li>
            <li>I had a cheap one of these</li>
            <li>this curling iron works fantastic... when it works.</li>
            <li>it curls your hair quickly and easily, and it is SO easy to learn how to use.</li>
            <li>However amazon was great at the return and it was super simple.</li>
            <li>It is definitely worth the money and the compliments you are bound to receive on your hair!</li>
            <li>I was very excited when I first got this</li>
            <li>I feel like my hair almost looks like a professional curled it because that&#x27;s how amazing it always looks after i use this rod.</li>
            <li>It heats up fast, comes with an adapter for all types of plugs, and the glove keeps my hands safe.</li>
            <li>It gets hot really fast, and provides very even heat, but I think you may have to rely on a really good hair product in order to maintain the curl.</li>
            <li>Just make sure to brush your hair very well before use, that way theres no weird creases in your hair!  </li>
            <li>Luckily this was a gift</li>
            <li>Shipping was fairly quick as well.</li>
            <li>The fact that it gets so hot is super important-</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased with this wand and would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li>This is hands down my favorite new go-to tool when I want to feel great about my hair.  </li>
            <li>This is the one and only iron that will give me the curls I love without using any products!</li>
            <li>Hold curl really well and works quickly!</li>
            <li>this curler is absolutely the best curling iron i have ever owned, and i have tried about ten different types.</li>
            <li>The only options are on and off and it seems to take maybe 10 minutes to warm up..</li>
            <li>Worth buying at the discounted price.</li>
            <li>Gives me just the right curls or wave that I&#x27;m looking for</li>
            <li>This product is normally fantastic however this particular item did not work.  </li>
            <li>it just didn&#x27;t hold very long) to this amazing rod.</li>
            <li>Shipping was very fast</li>
            <li>Plus it is great on hard to curl hair.</li>
            <li>Product was exactly as described.</li>
            <li>because if it only lasted longer than 2 months i would love it.  </li>
            <li>I might as well get rid of all of my other tools because this is my go to for sure!</li>
            <li>I ordered a size bigger than what I wanted but still love it.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li>Although this iron gets HOT, i have yet to burn myself.  </li>
            <li>This is my first curling wand</li>
            <li>Take your time using it, it&#x27;s pretty hot, but once you get the hang of it, you&#x27;ll curl your hair in no time.</li>
            <li>the style is unique, and looks much more natural than the curls made using a traditional iron.</li>
            <li>I have fine thin hair which I wrap around the iron and hold it for about 5-7 seconds and end up with a perfect curl every single time.</li>
            <li>I went from using a standard curling iron (with a clip, which always turned out to be a disaster), to wrapping my hair around the whole curling iron (which looked okay...</li>
            <li>Love the curling iron however the iron is not new.  </li>
            <li>It heats up super fast...easy for the early morning when you&#x27;re running to get yourself ready for the day.</li>
            <li>I have straight, fine, Asian hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had the real one and it broke</li>
            <li>Fast and convenient...</li>
            <li>Throughout the years, I&#x27;ve used different types of clip curling irons, from CHI to cheap drugstore products.</li>
            <li>After much deliberation, I decided to purchase this clip-free curling iron.</li>
            <li>but cant justify spending so much money on a product that has quit on me twice.</li>
            <li>The curling iron works really well.</li>
            <li>and I find that it&#x27;s ready to go when I get out.  </li>
            <li>I gave it 5 stars because i purchased this product without ever really knowing how to curl my hair.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery.</li>
            <li>The fact that its clipless means that you can&#x27;t really use the curling iron to go through a piece of hair you messed up and kind of flatten it again, however, if you give the hair you messed up, or want to redo, a minute to cool down and go through it again with the Enzo Milano, it has about the same effect  Things that are particular to me:  </li>
            <li>So easy to use on my long hair.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair and it never seems to hold a curl for very long.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t usually have that kind of time in the morning.   </li>
            <li>It does take a bit of time to warm up, however, I usually turn it on as I get into the shower</li>
            <li>HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT.</li>
            <li>The curls are so cute, very natural looking, without any hair product my curls lasted the entire day, and even the next!.</li>
            <li>The advertisement signified it was new and it did not come packaged as should.  </li>
            <li>I have short hair and the curls never last, doesn&#x27;t give me the kind of loose curls</li>
            <li>You are not able to sit the iron on top of a table or else</li>
            <li>The other day I tried a test run: curled my hair w/o any styling products, slept on it, and sure enough, my hair was still wavy in the morning.   </li>
            <li>not one but TWO have completely quit working on me.  </li>
            <li>I am really dissapointed with that, the box produc says its bi volt in very big letters</li>
            <li>and it might take me approximately 15 minutes to curl it, depending on what kind of look</li>
            <li>I have very long, fine hair, and the curl became a loose wave in a manner of about 2 hours.</li>
            <li>I just couldn&#x27;t justify spending almost half of the original purchase price just to get the new iron shipped back to me in NC!  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this curling rod for any one who struggles with a standard clip curling iron like myself.</li>
            <li>My hair curls fast and lasts long.</li>
            <li>It just doesn&#x27;t get hot enough for my hair and the curls don&#x27;t hold for very long.</li>
            <li>Clearly this was a used item not in proper packaging...</li>
            <li>I am constantly being asked how I get my hair to look the way it does, or if its natural curl.  </li>
            <li>I would now have the original purchase price of $130, plus my shipping fee of $10, plus their fees of $60, totaling $200 for a curling iron that has not created one single curl, but loads of hassle and wasted $$$.  </li>
            <li>(the spot at the back of you head where you can&#x27;t really reach or see) and have to be careful to not touch the barrel(it burns</li>
            <li>definitely has that sexy, Victoria Secret look going on.  </li>
            <li>My hair is thin and I&#x27;ve tried so many different curling irons and hair products.</li>
            <li>it means your hair takes on the curl shape much faster, you can go through your entire head in less than 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Also my hair can take some heat since it&#x27;s super thick and coarse</li>

            <li> I have short hair and the curls never last, doesn&#x27;t give me the kind of loose curls</li>
            <li> You are not able to sit the iron on top of a table or else</li>
            <li> The other day I tried a test run: curled my hair w/o any styling products, slept on it, and sure enough, my hair was still wavy in the morning.   </li>
            <li> not one but TWO have completely quit working on me.  </li>
            <li> I am really dissapointed with that, the box produc says its bi volt in very big letters</li>
            <li> and it might take me approximately 15 minutes to curl it, depending on what kind of look</li>
            <li> I have very long, fine hair, and the curl became a loose wave in a manner of about 2 hours.</li>
            <li> I just couldn&#x27;t justify spending almost half of the original purchase price just to get the new iron shipped back to me in NC!  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this curling rod for any one who struggles with a standard clip curling iron like myself.</li>
            <li> My hair curls fast and lasts long.</li>
            <li> It just doesn&#x27;t get hot enough for my hair and the curls don&#x27;t hold for very long.</li>
            <li> Clearly this was a used item not in proper packaging...</li>
            <li> I am constantly being asked how I get my hair to look the way it does, or if its natural curl.  </li>
            <li> I would now have the original purchase price of $130, plus my shipping fee of $10, plus their fees of $60, totaling $200 for a curling iron that has not created one single curl, but loads of hassle and wasted $$$.  </li>
            <li> (the spot at the back of you head where you can&#x27;t really reach or see) and have to be careful to not touch the barrel(it burns</li>
            <li> definitely has that sexy, Victoria Secret look going on.  </li>
            <li> My hair is thin and I&#x27;ve tried so many different curling irons and hair products.</li>
            <li> it means your hair takes on the curl shape much faster, you can go through your entire head in less than 30 minutes.</li>
            <li> Also my hair can take some heat since it&#x27;s super thick and coarse</li>
            <li> I usually curl it at night and by borning, it has loosened up a little and looks super natural.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend buying this, even though the price is a little steep.</li>
            <li> I have long hair, and I wanted something to give me bigger looser curls.</li>
            <li> Long Lasting curls.</li>
            <li> The curls last a long time too!</li>
            <li> Just saying that with this one you gotta be extra careful.  </li>
            <li> I posted a pic of my long hair.</li>
            <li> I have very long hair</li>
            <li> I burned my neck pretty bad the first time I used it because I was distracted by my toddler.</li>
            <li> One thing i thought would be very annoying was having to wrap my hair on it on my own, but it really doesnt matter, its not a hassle</li>
            <li> Personally, i will be buying a lot of the other Enzo Milano products, they&#x27;re truly revolutionary with their hair products!</li>
            <li> I have THICK curly hair on my own, which usually makes it very hard for curling irons to shape, but it does the  job without a hassle.</li>
            <li> Sorry I&#x27;m just a regular gal who doesn&#x27;t have any neat cubby holes to stash my hot iron in.</li>
            <li> I can create that I could never achieve before on my thin, straight hair.  </li>
            <li> Just be careful.</li>
            <li> so I decided to try a bit larger but because of my thin hair the curls didn&#x27;t last too long</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> I have had my other Enzo Milano for about a year and it has lasted.</li>
            <li> Just be careful and use the glove!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t time myself to see how long it took to curl my hair, but it felt, to me at least, it took less time than a traditional curling iron.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going for (loose or tight- tight</li>
            <li> the product finish, love the packaging and the gloves that come with it, I just hate the results.</li>
            <li> Products weight my hair down as well.</li>
            <li> I purchased this Enzo curling iron from ASAP Beauty thru Amazon on black Friday 2013.</li>
            <li> You can get a tight curl with this rod, or a looser curl if you don&#x27;t wrap the hair around it as tight.</li>
            <li> but if you have thin hair stay with the smaller size</li>
            <li> I watched a few YouTube tutorials on how to use it; those helped with technique.</li>
            <li> Not authentic.</li>
            <li> I fixed it with crazy glue</li>
            <li> ASAP beauty refused to take the return since it was 30 days past the delivery date of December 7th.</li>
            <li> I was a little hesitant to order not knowing whether this would end up in the pile of other cast aside, useless curling irons that don&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li> I have thick hair</li>
            <li> Its a little difficult to handle when you hit no man&#x27;s land</li>
            <li> , so maneuvering the iron is a little difficult around there, but</li>
            <li> but in the end it turned out to be such a disappointment!</li>
            <li> but aparently the product says something diferent in a very very tiny letter (size 1), Ive hated.</li>
            <li> Definitely a &amp;#34;must buy!&amp;#34; You will not be disappointed with this iron!</li>
            <li> , i cant find anything wrong with it.</li>
            <li> It was expensive and wouldn&#x27;t even heat up.  </li>
            <li> Then again maybe I&#x27;m just using it wrong..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not impressed.</li>
            <li> I believe the one I purchased here is an imposter or a fake and should no longer be sold through Amazon!</li>
            <li> but I was disappointed that it was so flimsy.</li>
            <li> im very disappointed</li>
            <li> very disappointed when I recieved this item in the packaging.  </li>
            <li> Terrible terrible experience and AWFUL customer service,  DO NOT PURCHASE!</li>

            <li> Not authentic. The curls don&#x27;t last. I&#x27;ve had the real one and it broke so i bought this, and it is not the same.</li>
            <li> this curler is absolutely the best curling iron i have ever owned, and i have tried about ten different types. it curls your hair quickly and easily, and it is SO easy to learn how to use. the style is unique, and looks much more natural than the curls made using a traditional iron.</li>
            <li> the curling iron is simply one of the best ones ive ever used. It heats up super fast...easy for the early morning when you&#x27;re running to get yourself ready for the day. The fact that it gets so hot is super important- it means your hair takes on the curl shape much faster, you can go through your entire head in less than 30 minutes. You put your hair through it and within 3 seconds, its nicely shaped. You can play around with the kind of shapes you want too, its not just the one kind of curl that you would get with the curling iron with clip.   One thing i thought would be very annoying was having to wrap my hair on it on my own, but it really doesnt matter, its not a hassle, you get very quick at it.   The fact that its clipless means that you can&#x27;t really use the curling iron to go through a piece of hair you messed up and kind of flatten it again, however, if you give the hair you messed up, or want to redo, a minute to cool down and go through it again with the Enzo Milano, it has about the same effect  Things that are particular to me:  I have THICK curly hair on my own, which usually makes it very hard for curling irons to shape, but it does the  job without a hassle. My own curls change to become the shape of the curl the iron gives it, no hassle. Just make sure to brush your hair very well before use, that way theres no weird creases in your hair!  Its a little difficult to handle when you hit no man&#x27;s land (the spot at the back of you head where you can&#x27;t really reach or see) and have to be careful to not touch the barrel(it burns you soo easily), so maneuvering the iron is a little difficult around there, but...its a curling iron thing. Just saying that with this one you gotta be extra careful.  Other than that, i cant find anything wrong with it. HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT. Personally, i will be buying a lot of the other Enzo Milano products, they&#x27;re truly revolutionary with their hair products! It also sleek and light weight, good cord so you can plug in everywhere, easy to maintain, love love love it &lt;3</li>
            <li> This wand does not work. I ended up buying the same brand curling wand at a salon and it worked great. I believe the one I purchased here is an imposter or a fake and should no longer be sold through Amazon!</li>
            <li> I was a little hesitant to order not knowing whether this would end up in the pile of other cast aside, useless curling irons that don&#x27;t work.  This is hands down my favorite new go-to tool when I want to feel great about my hair.  I love the \\&quot;beachy\\&quot; curls I can create that I could never achieve before on my thin, straight hair.  The Enzo Milano clipless iron is genius.</li>
            <li> I love the look this tool gives to my hair, but I would be completely in love with it if it had heat setting. The only options are on and off and it seems to take maybe 10 minutes to warm up.. I don&#x27;t usually have that kind of time in the morning.   Besides that I love this hair tool!</li>
            <li> Product was exactly as described. Very quick shipping!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the fact that this doesn&#x27;t have any heat settings. You are not able to sit the iron on top of a table or else it will melt it. Sorry I&#x27;m just a regular gal who doesn&#x27;t have any neat cubby holes to stash my hot iron in. Also my hair can take some heat since it&#x27;s super thick and coarse so I don&#x27;t think this iron is meant for thick/coarse hair. Luckily this was a gift and I didn&#x27;t have to pay for it.</li>
            <li> Fast and convenient...</li>
            <li> This product is amazing. I had a cheap one of these and it didn&#x27;t do a good job of curling. The curls last when I use this one. Shipping was very fast</li>
            <li> Overall great product! Hold curl really well and works quickly! Definitely a &amp;#34;must buy!&amp;#34; You will not be disappointed with this iron!</li>
            <li> I love this curling iron! I have straight, fine, Asian hair. Throughout the years, I&#x27;ve used different types of clip curling irons, from CHI to cheap drugstore products. After much deliberation, I decided to purchase this clip-free curling iron. I&#x27;m glad I did. The other day I tried a test run: curled my hair w/o any styling products, slept on it, and sure enough, my hair was still wavy in the morning.   As others have mentioned, it is easy to burn yourself. However, watch the provided tutorial c.d. I ditched the glove because I felt that I can grip my hair sections better without it. I didn&#x27;t time myself to see how long it took to curl my hair, but it felt, to me at least, it took less time than a traditional curling iron.</li>
            <li> this curling iron works fantastic... when it works. not one but TWO have completely quit working on me.  the 2nd one within 2 months of purchasing.  im very disappointed because if it only lasted longer than 2 months i would love it.  but cant justify spending so much money on a product that has quit on me twice.</li>
            <li> This conical iron is awesome. Plus it is great on hard to curl hair. I might as well get rid of all of my other tools because this is my go to for sure!</li>
            <li> I have very long, fine hair, and the curl became a loose wave in a manner of about 2 hours. It gets hot really fast, and provides very even heat, but I think you may have to rely on a really good hair product in order to maintain the curl. The glove comes in handy, so I&#x27;m glad it was included! Overall I&#x27;d give it a 7.5/10. Worth buying at the discounted price.</li>
            <li> This product is normally fantastic however this particular item did not work.  It was expensive and wouldn&#x27;t even heat up.  However amazon was great at the return and it was super simple.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair and it never seems to hold a curl for very long. Products weight my hair down as well. Enzo Milano is the Best curling iron I have owned. No products needed and my hair hold the curl into the next day. Buying one for my sister for Christmas.</li>
            <li> I really love the Enzo Milano curling irons. I bought one of the 19mm, and it heated up very quickly. I have long hair, and I wanted something to give me bigger looser curls. This does a great job. I have had my other Enzo Milano for about a year and it has lasted.</li>
            <li> The curling iron works really well. However, the plastic that holds the cylinder together separated very easily. I fixed it with crazy glue and it works fine, but I was disappointed that it was so flimsy.</li>
            <li> I went from using a standard curling iron (with a clip, which always turned out to be a disaster), to wrapping my hair around the whole curling iron (which looked okay...it just didn&#x27;t hold very long) to this amazing rod. I have fine thin hair which I wrap around the iron and hold it for about 5-7 seconds and end up with a perfect curl every single time. The curl holds well into the next day and still looks like i did my hair that day. You can get a tight curl with this rod, or a looser curl if you don&#x27;t wrap the hair around it as tight. I would highly recommend this curling rod for any one who struggles with a standard clip curling iron like myself. I feel like my hair almost looks like a professional curled it because that&#x27;s how amazing it always looks after i use this rod. I would highly recommend buying this, even though the price is a little steep. It is definitely worth the money and the compliments you are bound to receive on your hair!</li>
            <li> I have had the Enzo Milano Reverso Iron for almost 3 years now.  I am constantly being asked how I get my hair to look the way it does, or if its natural curl.  I have very long hair and it might take me approximately 15 minutes to curl it, depending on what kind of look I&#x27;m going for (loose or tight- tight takes longer).  It does take a bit of time to warm up, however, I usually turn it on as I get into the shower and I find that it&#x27;s ready to go when I get out.  LOVE second day hair- definitely has that sexy, Victoria Secret look going on.  I am constantly asking friends and family what they want for birthdays and such and they all say they want an Enzo Milano!</li>
            <li> Great curling iron. My hair curls fast and lasts long. I own a lot of Enzo Milano curling/flat irons. I&#x27;ve been happy with everything I have.</li>
            <li> Enzo Milano items are the best in town... I owe the smaller curling iron so I decided to try a bit larger but because of my thin hair the curls didn&#x27;t last too long, I would still recommend this brand but if you have thin hair stay with the smaller size</li>
            <li> I ordered a size bigger than what I wanted but still love it. I will keep it and order another in a smaller barrel size.</li>
            <li> BEST. CURLER. EVER&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;that and HANA blow dryer from Italy.. to die for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously.</li>
            <li> Heats up great and a very easy to use handle. Gives me just the right curls or wave that I&#x27;m looking for</li>
            <li> Love the curling iron however the iron is not new.  The advertisement signified it was new and it did not come packaged as should.  Box was open and torn no plastic around the product as it should be.  Thsi was supposed to be a gift and I talked about this product to no extent.  My sister in law has the curling iron and I used it prior to making this purchase and I loved it...very disappointed when I recieved this item in the packaging.  Would have been embarassed to give it as a gift as intened.  Clearly this was a used item not in proper packaging...</li>
            <li> I was very excited when I first got this but in the end it turned out to be such a disappointment! I have short hair and the curls never last, doesn&#x27;t give me the kind of loose curls I&#x27;m looking for.. Then again maybe I&#x27;m just using it wrong..&lt;br /&gt;Love the product finish, love the packaging and the gloves that come with it, I just hate the results.</li>
            <li> This is amazing just like I thought it would be! I wanted this iron for over a year, and could not wait a minute longer. I am a hairstylist and I got is as a tool to use in the salon! Wish I could have one at home too!</li>
            <li> The box says that the product is bi volt (110-220 v) but for my surprise, when i plugged the iron curl while i was out of the states the pruduct burned or broke. I am really dissapointed with that, the box produc says its bi volt in very big letters but aparently the product says something diferent in a very very tiny letter (size 1), Ive hated. when Ive contacted the seller they&#x27;ve said that i was supposed to contact the manufacturer. But why me???? they are suposed to contact, not me!</li>
            <li> Last year I purchased an Enzo MIlano curling iron.  After it arrived I plugged it in and waited...and waited...and waited.  While the light came on it did not heat up, ever!  I contacted Enzo Milano CS and was told to ship it back to them in CA and they would check it out and get in touch with me.  I sent it priority mail and it arrived in CA about four days later.  Around four WEEKS later, I finally heard from them via e-mail and was told to call with my CC# to cover the return shipping fee, along with \\&quot;warranty fees and handling charges\\&quot; totaling $60!  I would now have the original purchase price of $130, plus my shipping fee of $10, plus their fees of $60, totaling $200 for a curling iron that has not created one single curl, but loads of hassle and wasted $$$.  I just couldn&#x27;t justify spending almost half of the original purchase price just to get the new iron shipped back to me in NC!  I told them to keep it.  Terrible terrible experience and AWFUL customer service,  DO NOT PURCHASE!</li>
            <li> Great item. Exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li> I bought this around 3-4 years ago and when I bought it, it wasn&#x27;t $97. But I still have it and it still works like a charm. I have thick hair and I love how it keeps the curls all day with no product in it. I usually curl it at night and by borning, it has loosened up a little and looks super natural. Just be careful and use the glove!</li>
            <li> I gave it 5 stars because i purchased this product without ever really knowing how to curl my hair. I gave up on curling myself when i was younger because the curling irons my mom had didn&#x27;t do anything, except occasionally burn my neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At 23 i finally decided i need to grow up and learn to curl my hair. I ordered this based on online research and i am so happy with it. . I watched a few YouTube tutorials on how to use it; those helped with technique. Although this iron gets HOT, i have yet to burn myself.  The curls are so cute, very natural looking, without any hair product my curls lasted the entire day, and even the next!.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves this curling iron. Makes great curls and great price!</li>
            <li> Great price and product.  Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> Just be careful. I burned my neck pretty bad the first time I used it because I was distracted by my toddler.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for to create beautiful waves. You definitely do get what you pay for! Shipping was fairly quick as well. I&#x27;m content</li>
            <li> This is my first curling wand and I love it. Easy to use to make forward or backwards curls. They come out great and I get a ton of compliments. It heats up fast, comes with an adapter for all types of plugs, and the glove keeps my hands safe. I&#x27;m very pleased with this wand and would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this Enzo curling iron from ASAP Beauty thru Amazon on black Friday 2013. I wrapped it and put it under the tree for a Christmas present for my daughter. The 1st time she used it, it did not heat up and I contacted Amazon to return it. ASAP beauty refused to take the return since it was 30 days past the delivery date of December 7th. After explaining to Amazon &amp; ASAP Beauty that it was defective and wasn&#x27;t even opened until Christmas, ASAP agreed to take it back.  They would not send me a return label so I had to pay for the return myself thru USPS - Once I received confirmation of the return receipt via USPS, I contacted ASAP Beauty to see when my refund would be applied back to my credit card - I never heard from them. They would not return my emails and since they would not provide me a phone number to call them, I  disputed the charge with my credit card company. it is now April 9th and ASAP is giving my credit card company bogus information regarding the return I sent with proof of delivery.  DO NOT BUY ANY PRODUCT FROM ASAP BEAUTY!</li>
            <li> So easy to use on my long hair. Long Lasting curls. Take your time using it, it&#x27;s pretty hot, but once you get the hang of it, you&#x27;ll curl your hair in no time. I posted a pic of my long hair. Love it.</li>
            <li> The curling iron is okay. It just doesn&#x27;t get hot enough for my hair and the curls don&#x27;t hold for very long. I&#x27;m not impressed.</li>
            <li> Superb curling iron. Arrived on time.</li>
            <li> My hair is thin and I&#x27;ve tried so many different curling irons and hair products. This is the one and only iron that will give me the curls I love without using any products! The curls last a long time too!</li>
            <li> It came on time and seems to work ok. Doesn&#x27;t hold a curl as well as I would have hoped.</li>
            <li> This is such a awesome curling wand. It works so good. I love it.😄</li>
