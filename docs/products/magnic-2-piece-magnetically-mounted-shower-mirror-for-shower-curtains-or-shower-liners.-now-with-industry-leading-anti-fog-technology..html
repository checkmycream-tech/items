            <li>Great price.</li>
            <li>This mirror works wonderfully well and does exactly what it is advertised to do.  </li>
            <li>I also think it will be great when we are traveling; easy to pack and bring along.</li>
            <li>BUT IT IS REALLY NICE.</li>
            <li>So far this is a excellent mirror it doesn&#x27;t fog up</li>
            <li>I might consider buying some rain-x to make it better.</li>
            <li>My husband could not be happier :)</li>
            <li>MY HUSBAND REALLY LOVE THIS MIRROR</li>
            <li>simply most of them use suction cups that eventually wears out and no longer sticks.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this as a replacement to my &#x27;simplehuman Wall Mount Shower Mirror&#x27; that cost me more than twice as much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>We love that you can take it on and off anytime</li>
            <li>He travels extensively and this design is perfect for traveling with.  </li>
            <li>Any dude that shaves in the shower will love this mirror.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m confident I&#x27;ll be traveling with it as well.</li>
            <li>The nice thing about this product is that it&#x27;s so easy to clean versus the permanent mounts.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy magnic system on the curtain is brilliant.&lt;br</li>
            <li>However, it&#x27;s not too strong as to damage a cloth curtain, which I use it with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s still useful, but I guess it could be better.</li>
            <li>The magnetic attachment feature works really well and holds on strongly.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted!</li>
            <li>Great concept magnets hold it in place set it and forget it.&lt;br /&gt;Update 10 months later, still like new.</li>
            <li>prefer the magnetic mounting concept better than mirrors that use an adhesive mount, or mirrors that attach directly on the shower</li>
            <li>/&gt;Gentlemen, it&#x27;s the right size for shaving your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I just splash some hot water over it and it clears right up.</li>
            <li>Does exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li>Works exactly as advertised and does NOT fog up.</li>
            <li>Works pretty well.</li>
            <li>My husband absolutely loves this mirror in the shower!</li>
            <li>Simple design and a strong magnet.</li>
            <li>magnetic hardware used is plenty strong enough to hold the mirror in place for days.  </li>
            <li>not as large as I thought it would be</li>
            <li>I would have liked it a little bigger, but the convenience of having a shower mirror that&#x27;s adjustable simply by twisting off the strong magnet makes it well worth the purchase!</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>Who wants to start a business?</li>
            <li>I do not think that the water here in Hawaii is particularly hard, but there is evidence of significant calcium deposits around my shower that I am sure are making it to my shower</li>
            <li>The magnetic system is much more sanitary then other fixed mirrors that are secured with silicone caulk, mold trap !!!</li>
            <li>up.&lt;br /&gt;Until this one,  I&#x27;m so glad I don&#x27;t have to worry about it falling off the wall due to the suction cup or whatever.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>That merits a high rating in my book.</li>
            <li>I dry it after every shower to cut down on water spotting, but it is still like new.&lt;br /&gt;4 year update still working as good as new</li>
            <li>The husband really likes it, so far.</li>
            <li>If it gets hard to see a quick splash of hot water and it clears right up.</li>
            <li>Its design/construction also lends to easily taking it down for a thorough cleaning to ensure that the amount of scale that accumulates on the mirror face can be kept at bay.</li>
            <li>We didn&#x27;t want to screw something into the brand new tile</li>
            <li>easy to use, just pull apart the front and back pieces and bring them back together again with the inner curtain in between.&lt;br</li>
            <li>AND NOW COMPLETELY FOGS UP</li>
            <li>A minute under the faucet with some hand soap, and your&#x27;re back in action.</li>

            <li> but I didn&#x27;t expected to be at this price.  </li>

            <li> Just like any other mirror, after a week or so, you get some residue from steam, mineral content, soap, etc.  </li>
            <li> I have personally found that a shallow bath of 50/50 CLR and water will take off almost all of the gunk.</li>
            <li> Starts to fog up after a short period of time rendering it a bit useless.  </li>
            <li> I have not had it for long, but if it takes a turn for the worst, I&#x27;ll come update this review.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband after 3 disappointing shower mirror purchases.  </li>
            <li> He hated it.  </li>

            <li> I have shower doors and I didn&#x27;t think it would work, because they are too thick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IT DOES WORK WITH SHOWER DOORS!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also doesn&#x27;t fog up. I have not had it for long, but if it takes a turn for the worst, I&#x27;ll come update this review.</li>
            <li> Does exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li> Simple design and a strong magnet. Hasn&#x27;t fogged up yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: LASTED 6 MONTHS AND NOW COMPLETELY FOGS UP</li>
            <li> not as large as I thought it would be</li>
            <li> Magnet holds well, great for fellas that like to shave in the shower.  Requires regular wiping with some glass cleaner.  I might consider buying some rain-x to make it better.</li>
            <li> works as advertised, no need for suction cups and mirror stays up without any fuss.</li>
            <li> Best shaving in the shower mirror I have ever purchased! Works exactly as advertised and does NOT fog up. Thanks.</li>
            <li> Works pretty well. Does have a slime on it but that&#x27;s probably the Anti-fog chemicals. Just rinse it and fog goes away.</li>
            <li> We recently remodeled our bathroom and our shower has a stone tile that will not hold a suction cup.  We didn&#x27;t want to screw something into the brand new tile and I though my husband would be out of luck shaving in the shower until I found this mirror!!  It is perfect.  I holds wonderfully on the curtain and does not fog! My husband could not be happier :)</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted!</li>
            <li> Great product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its a staple in my home now.  Bought one for travel as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would def recommend it.</li>
            <li> LET ME TELL YOU , MY HUSBAND REALLY LOVE THIS MIRROR, I BOUGHT IT FOR FATHERS DAY GIFT…. I KNOW I GIVE IT TO HIM BEFORE FATHERS DAY. BUT IT IS REALLY NICE. GREAT GIFT</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving in the shower for as long as I can remember. And never could find a mirror to stay put and not get fogged up.&lt;br /&gt;Until this one,  I&#x27;m so glad I don&#x27;t have to worry about it falling off the wall due to the suction cup or whatever. It&#x27;s easy magnic system on the curtain is brilliant.&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;ll never buy again,  unless for a gift!</li>
            <li> Great Mirror!  Bought it for my husband to use when he travels. Going to order it for my 2 sons!!  It arrived with the mirror loose so my husband glued it so it wouldn&#x27;t fall out in the shower.</li>
            <li> The husband really likes it, so far. I also think it will be great when we are traveling; easy to pack and bring along.</li>
            <li> I purchased one of these around six weeks ago, and here are my thoughts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gentlemen, it&#x27;s the right size for shaving your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I prefer the magnetic mounting concept better than mirrors that use an adhesive mount, or mirrors that attach directly on the shower neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s easy to use, just pull apart the front and back pieces and bring them back together again with the inner curtain in between.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The magnetic hardware used is plenty strong enough to hold the mirror in place for days.  However, it&#x27;s not too strong as to damage a cloth curtain, which I use it with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This item has exceeded my expectations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Side note: Just like any other mirror, after a week or so, you get some residue from steam, mineral content, soap, etc.  The nice thing about this product is that it&#x27;s so easy to clean versus the permanent mounts.  A minute under the faucet with some hand soap, and your&#x27;re back in action.</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;fogless&amp;#34; part doesn&#x27;t work. The product stays put when I take a shower, but you have to keep splashing water on it to prevent fogging. I would not recommend this product if you are using it to help you shave in the shower.</li>
            <li> So far this is a excellent mirror it doesn&#x27;t fog up and it stays in place. GREAT ITEM!!!!</li>
            <li> My husband&#x27;s shower mirror fell off tiles and cracked.  He refused to shave without it.  I bought what I thought was the Cadillac of shower mirrors at CVS for almost $50.  He hated it.  Got this for under $20 and he loves it.&lt;br /&gt;Finally, he got rid of that scratchy beard.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for the gym shower.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend. Works as advertised. It is perfect for a shower curtain.</li>
            <li> Starts to fog up after a short period of time rendering it a bit useless.  Maybe an application of some type of anti-fogger will help</li>
            <li> Got this as a gift.  I&#x27;ve stopped purchasing shower mirrors simply most of them use suction cups that eventually wears out and no longer sticks.  Drilling into shower wall is not an option for me so I simply stopped shaving in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This mirror solves my problem!  It simply works.  Two pieces of acrylics that clamps over shower curtain using magnets!  Its removable and yet does its job hanging on.  Minus a star for fogless mirror that isn&#x27;t permanent but I didn&#x27;t expected to be at this price.  Like all other fogless shower mirror, it begins to fog a little after 3 months of daily use.  I just splash some hot water over it and it clears right up.</li>
            <li> My husband absolutely loves this mirror in the shower! He&#x27;s even asked me to order another to keep in his travel toiletry kit.</li>
            <li> I purchased this as a replacement to my &#x27;simplehuman Wall Mount Shower Mirror&#x27; that cost me more than twice as much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a month, I am impressed at the anti-fog feature of this mirror. Its design/construction also lends to easily taking it down for a thorough cleaning to ensure that the amount of scale that accumulates on the mirror face can be kept at bay. I think that this is the biggest problem with a permanently mounted mirror. I have personally found that a shallow bath of 50/50 CLR and water will take off almost all of the gunk. Because it is magnetically mounted, there is no risk of a I do not think that the water here in Hawaii is particularly hard, but there is evidence of significant calcium deposits around my shower that I am sure are making it to my shower mirror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It may seem contradictory, but I have to subtract a star because of the way that it is mounted on to the shower curtain. A bump with your elbow or the redirection of a stream of water against the liner causes the thing to bounce around. I am not a fan of this when I am holding a razor blade to my throat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really wish that someone sold a mirror that easily detached from a permanently mounted base unit. Who wants to start a business?</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve had this mirror for 2 months and it works great. We love that you can take it on and off anytime you want.</li>
            <li> This is the perfect product for those that can&#x27;t use suction cup mirrors.  The magnet works great, we connected through the shower liner and have had no issues.</li>
            <li> My husband has used the mirror 2 times and a film formed on it. When it was wet, it felt gooey. Now that it is dry, it looks like something has been rubbed on it. Dose anyone know if there is a trick to getting the film off? The concept of a magnetic mirror is great, but if you can&#x27;t see yourself in it, it is worthless. Any suggestions?</li>
            <li> I am really happy with the magnetic attachment. The suction cup units don&#x27;t stay and I didn&#x27;t want one that hung from the shower head.  Very happy.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband after 3 disappointing shower mirror purchases.  This mirror works wonderfully well and does exactly what it is advertised to do.  He travels extensively and this design is perfect for traveling with.  The magnetic attachment feature works really well and holds on strongly.  The mirror has retained its fogless properties and he&#x27;s been using it now for almost 3 months.  Great design, wonderful product, superior customer service!</li>
            <li> It was supposed to be fogless, after a couple days, I need to pour water over it every 5 minutes if I want to use it...&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s still useful, but I guess it could be better.</li>
            <li> My nephew is going off to college.  Sent him this as part of Christmas gift.  He loves this.  Excellent quality.  Great price.</li>
            <li> Any dude that shaves in the shower will love this mirror.  I would have liked it a little bigger, but the convenience of having a shower mirror that&#x27;s adjustable simply by twisting off the strong magnet makes it well worth the purchase!</li>
            <li> I like it, but it started to fog after a month.</li>
            <li> Brilliant idea for a shower mirror.  I&#x27;m confident I&#x27;ll be traveling with it as well.</li>
            <li> Great product! Would purchase again.</li>
            <li> Very fair price and works as advertised . That merits a high rating in my book. The magnetic system is much more sanitary then other fixed mirrors that are secured with silicone caulk, mold trap !!! Well done .</li>
            <li> Great concept magnets hold it in place set it and forget it.&lt;br /&gt;Update 10 months later, still like new. I dry it after every shower to cut down on water spotting, but it is still like new.&lt;br /&gt;4 year update still working as good as new</li>
            <li> Have used this item for a week now. I am very happy with it. If it gets hard to see a quick splash of hot water and it clears right up. Would have given 5 stars if it were a little bigger.</li>
