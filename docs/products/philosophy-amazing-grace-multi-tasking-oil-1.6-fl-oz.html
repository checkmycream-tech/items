            <li> I have long hair to the middle of my back and used ONE pump warmed into my hands and applied bottom up....</li>
            <li> This smells like plain old vegetable oil.</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s expensive, but worth it.</li>
            <li> Small amount goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> Only requires a small amount!  </li>
            <li> What a waste of money.</li>
            <li> But it is a little pricey!</li>
            <li> So it seems like a pointless purchase.</li>
            <li> Sadly, the products are not the same since Coty purchased the company.</li>
            <li> May not purchase anymore philosophy products due to the price being expensive and the product being inferior.</li>
            <li> That can get expensive</li>

            <li> I love Amazing Grace fragrance but not this or anything they make anymore (big mistake)They suggest putting in your hair??? That&#x27;s a great idea if you want to look a little greasy. I have long hair to the middle of my back and used ONE pump warmed into my hands and applied bottom up.... Not my first rodeo.  It&#x27;s junk for hair.  So I used it on my legs one time for a moisturizer ...so far didn&#x27;t noticed anything to brag about  As I&#x27;m keeping this as far away from my hair as possible.  perhaps I&#x27;ll try it in one of those fancy oil warmers and if I&#x27;m lucky I might get some satisfaction from this not so Amazing purchase.  Fragrance smells great but does not last.  By the grace of God they will bring back a quality product!!</li>
            <li> This is the most amazing scent!</li>
            <li> Love this smell, use on my hair:)</li>
            <li> I loved it I ordered it twice</li>
            <li> This oil smells just like the perfume.Very light smell. But last for me. I ordered two.Will buy again!!</li>
            <li> Arrived just as described.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my mother and she loves it.</li>
            <li> I love the scent of both Amazing Grace and Pure Grace.  It will perfect for adding it to the lotion and giving it a little more scent.  I wish this scent lasted a lttle longer.</li>
            <li> Very pleasurably lightly scented.</li>
            <li> I love Amazing Grace and this oil has that wonderful fragrance. This lasts better than the perfume. It&#x27;s soft and fresh. It says to dilute it with water but I just apply it directly from the bottle. That can get expensive so I don&#x27;t put it on all the time that way.</li>
            <li> This is very nice. Not sure if the scent last as long as I would like it too.  But it is a little pricey!</li>
            <li> This smells like plain old vegetable oil. Not even a hint of the Amazing Grace scent that I love. What a waste of money. Please don&#x27;t buy this product.</li>
            <li> Love everything Amazing Grace!  Oil can be used for many purposes.  Only requires a small amount!  Small amount goes a long way.  Can be used in your hair and on your body!  Love the smell.  Great for layering</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s expensive, but worth it. I use it on itchy skin, dry skin, or after shaving. It smells wonderful and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I ordered this because I had smelled it on a friend, and fell in love. It smells good, if you inhale the bottle.  But once it is on your skin, you can no longer smell it.  So it seems like a pointless purchase.</li>
            <li> Love all philosophy products. Adds a little more moisture for dry summer skin!</li>
            <li> had no fragrance at all out of the bottle</li>
            <li> Turns out I was allergic to it.</li>
            <li> It realy is a multi tasker.  I put in my bath, use it as perfume or an oil for my skin.  I will order again</li>
            <li> I enjoyed the hair oil that philosophy had before.  This one comes in 2nd place. I have used soooo many.  I want my hair to look shiny but not oily.  I want to be able to straighten my hair flat without frizz.  Philosophy no longer makes my favorite, this will now be my go to.</li>
            <li> To much alcohol in it&lt;br /&gt;Dried.my skin automatically</li>
            <li> I have used philosophy amazing grace products for years. Sadly, the products are not the same since Coty purchased the company. I was happy to find this amazing grace oil but think it still dosnt have the same fragrance as the products did in the beginning. Very light and hope it will work by adding to the body lotion. Tried some on my skin but it didnt have much staying power. It does smell better than the cologne. If only the company would listen to all the reviews and change the products back as they were to start. May not purchase anymore philosophy products due to the price being expensive and the product being inferior. The seller has excellent shipping time!</li>
