            <li>Its kinda a spicy smell but its not horrible...</li>
            <li>thank you Amazon :)</li>
            <li>There aren&#x27;t too many perfumes or colognes that match well with my chemistry</li>
            <li>but this one surely does.</li>
            <li>AND I LOVE IT</li>
            <li>I just love this perfume and was so glad glad when I found it, as it isn&#x27;t available from many stores now ...</li>
            <li>I was thrilled I got such a great deal on my favorite perfume that I am used to spending $70 on.</li>
            <li>It is totally worth the price!!</li>
            <li>Until then, I will continue to love this perfectly balanced perfume-not too floral, not too sweet, not too spicy but just enough of everything!</li>
            <li>But not too strong.  </li>
            <li>Everyone noticed when I used it first and everyone liked it.</li>
            <li>Fell in love with this perfume the first time I came across it!</li>
            <li>I would definitely buy this again however, very sexy fragrance!</li>
            <li>Exact thing is right here!!!</li>
            <li>Another fantastic perfume from Elizabeth Arden.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly &amp; as described</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really fresh and sweet.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my new favorite scent.</li>
            <li>This is different from &amp;#34;Pretty&amp;#34;, but just as nice.</li>
            <li>I had been out of Pretty Hot for a while, so when it came yesterday I was elated!</li>
            <li>Her favorite has always been Red Door, but this is right up there with it.</li>
            <li>If you want to smell and feel sexy, this is definitely one to try.</li>
            <li>The smell is floral and fruity and quite nice, but it lasts for all of half an hour.  </li>
            <li>My husband bought 2 large bottles for Christmas</li>
            <li>We highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>Wife really loves this gift.</li>
            <li>The delivery was fast.  </li>
            <li>I love expensive perfume but can&#x27;t afford to purchase it on my own.  </li>
            <li>Seductive scent, enjoy wearing it as much ads possible; your price was more than 50% less than depth.</li>
            <li>Got it first at Kohl&#x27;s with a 30% off coupon but the bottle was smaller and the price was still slightly higher than what we paid for this BIG bottle.  </li>
            <li>When this bottle is gone I&#x27;ll be back to purchase another one here at Amazon and maybe even try the partner perfume &#x27;Pretty&#x27;.  </li>
            <li>This scent is sweet and a little</li>
            <li>I love the fact that all you need is a small spray of this and it lasts a very long time.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little &#x27;bold&#x27; at first until it settles down and works WITH my chemistry.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soft, spicy and romantic.</li>
            <li>This is a unique scent that is not overpowering, yet lingers deliciously.&lt;br /&gt;Not too flowery, citrusy nor musky - hard to find a scent lately that is just right.</li>

            <li> its not a great smell either tho.</li>
            <li> I am sad that they have stopped making this perfume.  </li>

            <li> Love, Love this fragrance! I get compliments on it every time I wear it!</li>
            <li> my wife&#x27;s favorite perfume EVER. Got it first at Kohl&#x27;s with a 30% off coupon but the bottle was smaller and the price was still slightly higher than what we paid for this BIG bottle.  Not too strong, not too floral, not musky, very appealing.  She gets compliments ALL the time.</li>
            <li> I have yet to see this in the stores but caught it on Amazon a few years back and been getting it for my wife ever since. Her favorite has always been Red Door, but this is right up there with it. Not over powering but a sweet clean,very feminine scent that&#x27;s perfect on her. We highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Excellent purchase. Shipment was great</li>
            <li> You could go to a department store and pay triple the price.  Exact thing is right here!!!</li>
            <li> The smell is floral and fruity and quite nice, but it lasts for all of half an hour.  It&#x27;s a real shame because this summery scent smells great on me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband however claims it smells like air freshener, so there you go.</li>
            <li> I am in love with the fragrance. Everyone noticed when I used it first and everyone liked it. It is totally worth the price!!</li>

            <li> I had been out of Pretty Hot for a while, so when it came yesterday I was elated! My husband when bananas, he loves it too! This perfume is a lovely mix of floral, and a touch of spice (sexy). What a value, 23.00 for over 3 oz. of perfume. I am going to order ALL my perfume from this seller, no more Macys prices for me!</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly &amp; as described</li>
            <li> Not a lot to say about it.  I ordered it for my wife on a whim and she liked it.</li>
            <li> This scent is sweet and a little florally....but not musky by any means.  It&#x27;s really fresh and sweet.  It&#x27;s my new favorite scent.</li>
            <li> A great buy it smell real good and the bottle is big so it wood last you for a while</li>
            <li> Love this perfume! I get so many compliments about this perfume however it has now been discontinued by the manufacturer!

            <li> I was expecting a different smell. Its kinda a spicy smell but its not horrible...its not a great smell either tho. But i did recieve my pkg in a timely manner and i was very happy with the shipping process.</li>
            <li> Elizabeth Arden comes through again! This is a unique scent that is not overpowering, yet lingers deliciously.&lt;br /&gt;Not too flowery, citrusy nor musky - hard to find a scent lately that is just right.</li>
            <li> Seductive scent, enjoy wearing it as much ads possible; your price was more than 50% less than depth. Stores.</li>
            <li> I just love this perfume and was so glad glad when I found it, as it isn&#x27;t available from many stores now ... thank you Amazon :)</li>
            <li> I received this perfume as a gift.  I love expensive perfume but can&#x27;t afford to purchase it on my own.  I am so delighted with this fragrance! It&#x27;s a little &#x27;bold&#x27; at first until it settles down and works WITH my chemistry. I love the fact that all you need is a small spray of this and it lasts a very long time. It even smells expensive, not overly priced either (on sale) as I see here.

            <li> Love the product and I love Amazon !!</li>
            <li> Girlfriend loves the scent.  This is different from &amp;#34;Pretty&amp;#34;, but just as nice.</li>
            <li> AWESOME....smells GREAT!!  Love all of Elizabeth Arden perfumes and this one is another to add to the list!!!!</li>
            <li> Great fragrance to add to my arsenal. It&#x27;s soft, spicy and romantic. I can wear this fragrance all year long. It&#x27;s perfect for hanging out downtown with friends in the summer or even a fall afternoon date at the theater. Not overpowering at all, in fact I wish the scent lasted just a tad longer. My honey could still smell it up close to me, I may have become immune to the scent by then, not sure. I would definitely buy this again however, very sexy fragrance!</li>
            <li> GOOD NIGHT&lt;br /&gt;I ALREADY GET IT THE PERFUME OF ELIZABETH ARDEN AND I LOVE IT THE PRODUCT IT IS GOOD ! SEE YOU</li>
            <li> I was thrilled I got such a great deal on my favorite perfume that I am used to spending $70 on.</li>
            <li> The delivery was fast.  However the perfume has a weakened scent and somewhat &amp;#34;aged&amp;#34; smelling.</li>
