            <li>you can knock it all out in one sitting, but I&#x27;ve found that it works best if you chip away day by day.</li>
            <li>It is Awesome!  </li>
            <li>I began to research, via Amazon, the best method/device to handle this issue.  </li>
            <li>I found the best results when I went by feel and would check my work in the mirror.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m totally impressed with the results!  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s awesome.</li>

            <li>beats the heck out of the kind that uses a disposable razor.</li>
            <li>To be honest, i didn&#x27;t use the foil head at all to go super-smooth.</li>
            <li>Flexible head is a nice feature.  </li>
            <li>The feel is nice.</li>
            <li>Kinda meh to be honest.  </li>
            <li>This is a nice alternative to the hair removal products out on the market.</li>
            <li>From what I can tell it looks nice.</li>
            <li>Having a rechargeable battery is a nice touch too.</li>
            <li>Nice product,  before making a decision you need to make 10 shaves or so to both get used to the product and allow your skin to adjust.</li>
            <li>look very good but what can you do right?  </li>
            <li>This was a great update from the original.  </li>
            <li>I had the original Remington body groomer before and it was great until it broke.</li>
            <li>I had the original man groomer in 2011 which cost 19.99 and it worked great</li>
            <li>Everyone wins!!!</li>
            <li>This unit works as well as she did, lol, thus I don&#x27;t have to ask anybody and it shaves close and does a pretty darn good job.  </li>
            <li>The foil head does a great clean up job.  </li>
            <li>The foil blade is especially effective and is the best solution I&#x27;ve ever had for removing my body hair - it usually cuts the hair in one or two passes.</li>
            <li>Very easy to use and is extremely effective for self grooming.</li>
            <li>I am very happy with the way this works, like the look and highly recommend it</li>
            <li>I have used the normal head and the speed boost and find that works best for me.  </li>
            <li>Very well made, ive tried ever else as far as machines, this is the best, got 2 of my friends to but as well, very happy with this purchase</li>
            <li>Very safe, easy and satisfying!</li>
            <li>But the best thing is the new head.  </li>
            <li>this is the best darn piece of equipment I own by far.  </li>
            <li>I have used it twice and charged once, so battery life seems good, and it&#x27;s still going strong.  </li>
            <li>The power is strong and length of handle is good.  </li>
            <li>Very easy to use.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is very easy to use</li>
            <li>This is sturdy, with a very strong motor.  </li>
            <li>The heads remove and install very easily.  </li>
            <li>Very easy to use</li>
            <li>( I&#x27;m sure there are better ways!)</li>
            <li>Best so far !</li>
            <li>sure would be nice</li>
            <li>It sure would be nice is</li>
            <li>Great product and well worth the money.</li>
            <li>Great product, worth every</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s the best thing I&#x27;ve found so far.</li>
            <li>My hubby loves this, it&#x27;s easy to use and is sturdy!</li>
            <li>So easy to use and works wonders!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s easy, yes, you should do yourself (and your woman) a favor and buy this!</li>
            <li>The Mangroomer gets a remarkable close shave in a quick amount of time.</li>
            <li>smooth edges, nice grip, nice positions, buttons etc.  </li>
            <li>I was able to do it, but it wasn&#x27;t very easy.</li>
            <li>The first 2-3 hours after clipping the hair you&#x27;ll feel great.</li>
            <li>Great product, exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>I will first admit that I have always been proud of my body hair.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m pretty happy with it.</li>
            <li>I haveno idea of how reliable the mangroomer will prove, but I&#x27;m happy with the first results.</li>
            <li>Great product that does exactly what it says.</li>
            <li>I super recommend this thing works wonders!!</li>
            <li>Nice product, easy to use</li>
            <li>Amazingly easy to use and effective.</li>
            <li>The product is easy to use, durable (from what I can tell so far) and does its job flawlessly!</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure if the lever was supposed to move freely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I sent 3 more emails and still no response</li>
            <li>I sent 3 more emails and still no response</li>
            <li>even more so.  </li>
            <li>This one is built so much better.</li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s rechargable instead of having to use 2 AA batteries.</li>
            <li>*** having to make sure you always have spare batteries sitting around in case</li>
            <li>So I love that it&#x27;s rechargable</li>
            <li>how many years I will get out of the battery.</li>
            <li>I have not used the foil head just yet as the regular head does an excellent job.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve done it many times ), laser treatment and electrolysis.</li>
            <li>Works better than its brother unit without the extension.  </li>
            <li>and they would have been more effective&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>It should be able to get a closer cut than it does.</li>
            <li>Love the tool.</li>
            <li>best back shaver ever made use it for my head as well!!</li>
            <li>The handle has an adjustable angle which is just perfect for getting anywhere on the back.</li>
            <li>I love that the battery for the Mangroomer even came charged.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>but I love it.  </li>
            <li>Glad I don&#x27;t have to use this</li>
            <li>It needs to be 2 times wider or more.</li>
            <li>Just make sure you keep your receipt and any pertinent info to redeem a warranty replacement!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this Product.</li>

            <li>(you now that spot when you have an itch and can&#x27;t reach :).  </li>
            <li>and my back was looking great!!!  </li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>Now I don&#x27;t have to shave him anymore  :-)</li>
            <li>Best Product Ever for Back Shaving!!!!</li>
            <li>If you travel its better if you put it in the suitcase discharged so ther will be no surprises at the airport.</li>
            <li>This is a seriously good product and well worth the money.  </li>
            <li>Felt a need to write another review about how much I love this thing.  </li>
            <li>The shaver works greater than any I&#x27;ve come across for the price.  </li>
            <li>, Alway&#x27;s a Bear&amp;#34; :)</li>
            <li>I thought for sure I was going to end up one of those guys with the &amp;#34;hair type&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I was able to maneuver the MANGroomer so as to get everything trimmed up - arms, legs, torso, etc.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m sure that will change with time and practice.  </li>
            <li>But this device is a sure thing.  </li>
            <li>I use it twice a week and feel better about myself.  </li>
            <li>I have a lot more confidence in myself about using this.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, this iteration is OUTSTANDING.</li>
            <li>This is an outstanding product.</li>
            <li>I just love this product.  </li>
            <li>Using it takes some time to make sure the shaving head is hitting square on the part of the body shaved, but the adjustable arm makes it foolproof.</li>
            <li>Excellent product for back hair</li>
            <li>Fabulous!</li>
            <li>but it is more than sufficient for me.  </li>
            <li>Without a doubt the best lifestyle and personal grooming purchase I have ever made.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this thing.</li>
            <li>worry free!  </li>
            <li>My expectations of this product are completely satisfied.</li>
            <li>This one is much better.</li>
            <li>Again, more hyperbole.</li>
            <li>The best and easiest way to take care of back hair.  </li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t think it was ever &#x27;sexy&#x27;.  </li>
            <li>Best gift I ever got for my boyfriend and for myself since I no longer have to shave his back.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad that I found this before trying something like that.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and they keep getting better.</li>
            <li>Works great - fast and efficient.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>This is the best back shaver I have ever owned.</li>
            <li>When there&#x27;s more hair growing on your body than your head, you need something like this.  </li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>it did a tad bit more.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;d better stop eating cakes etc.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Wonderful for the back, but also great for whole body.</li>
            <li>Excellent product, told girlfriend that I had my back shaved at a message parlor by a Gehia girl, since she refused to do so, so many times.</li>
            <li>, I am glad I did.</li>
            <li>I love this thing.</li>
            <li>i feel more confident being able to take my shirt off now</li>
            <li>, I did many rounds of laser hair removal</li>
            <li>It was just ok.</li>
            <li>I would say it it is a problem solver for sure</li>
            <li>Best unit yet for my back.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>It gets to those hard-to-reach places in the midback better than anything else I&#x27;ve used, aside from another pair of hands.</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>This is the best thing I&#x27;ve found to de-fuzz my back.  </li>

            <li>I always have problems with the hair of my back now is al solve with this item awesome!!!!</li>
            <li>It took a while, but I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll get faster with practice -</li>
            <li>Went with top of the line rechargeable this time and glad I did.  </li>
            <li>If you have a hairy back this is the perfect solution.</li>
            <li>ITS OK</li>
            <li>THE HEAD NEEDS TO ANGLE MORE TO ME</li>
            <li>The product works better than I thought, but it takes some practice to get the angle</li>
            <li>I found that advice to be worthwhile.</li>
            <li>It will work much better and you won&#x27;t fumble with the angle of the head of the device so much.&lt;br</li>
            <li>more features.</li>
            <li>…the build quality is way better.  </li>
            <li>The foil head is a nice feature to smooth away any stubble left.&lt;br</li>

            <li>Glad I purchased this.</li>

            <li>/&gt;I am so happy with this and wish I had received this sooner, it is has made shaving much quicker and gives a better result.  </li>
            <li>This is a must for anyone shaving their back!!ives a better result.  </li>

            <li>Blades were very comfortable and the curve of the arm made it easy to stand in the mirror, turn around and reach everything.  </li>
            <li>However, the recipient actually loved it and wanted another one when he broke the first one.</li>
            <li>Even with that said, I feel it provided good results for a first time use.</li>
            <li>The best tool is the double sided fine clipper with the shaver head.</li>
            <li>I was not disappointed!  </li>
            <li>I thought that one was great until getting this new one.</li>
            <li>This is amazing and works great to remove hair on your back.</li>
            <li>Cuts effectively, recharges quickly.</li>
            <li>This tool makes quick work of it in no time the hair is gone at you&#x27;re own leisure.</li>
            <li>and I love how easy it is to change the clippers as well as adjust the trimmer for the desired area of grooming.</li>
            <li>wow lol, you get it :)</li>
            <li>his back is smooth and delicious now!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s mostly a matter about feeling comfortable and confident with one&#x27;s self, and this thing does the trick.</li>
            <li>Best product out there to remove back hair, hands down, it is easy to use, amazing results !!!</li>
            <li>Very good back shaver.</li>
            <li>Very good to shave the back.</li>
            <li>The whole unit is much higher quality construction that i would consider very good (though still plastic).  </li>
            <li>Be sure to press lightly against your back  (as stated in instructions) or it will feel not feel very good.  </li>
            <li>This is without a doubt the easiest and best product to use for shaving your back when you don&#x27;t have a special someone to do it for you.</li>
            <li>I rarely review things but this thing is amazing.  </li>
            <li>Just keep an eye on the double-sided trimmer/foil to be sure the foil is secure.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been working great so far.</li>
            <li>It does what it&#x27;s suppose to do and most importantly saves me the trip and money from going to one of those hair removal and wax treatment places</li>
            <li>Wow it works great and no sasquatch in the neighborhood anymore.</li>
            <li>Exactly as described makes the perfect gift for my 86 year old grandmother.</li>
            <li>First time I&#x27;ve used a product like this and am very satisfied.</li>
            <li>great product so far.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery and good product</li>
            <li>When i bought this shaver I didn&#x27;t expect much even though it received good reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After reading all the negative reviews I was worried that I had not made a good purchase, however this thing works great and is very easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Better than the original but</li>
            <li>I like this one much better than the original Mangroomer</li>
            <li>I was able to shave it all off using this product, and it was quite satisfying to be able to do it alone for the first time.</li>
            <li>Definitely better than the original.</li>
            <li>I gave the BakBlade a try next and absolutely loved it!  </li>
            <li>Much better than the original version.</li>
            <li>Easy to handle.</li>
            <li>I would use a mirror though cause it is easy to miss spots.</li>
            <li>So easy to use.</li>
            <li>So easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>It takes a few uses to get used to the best way to use it for your body, but once you get it dialed in it works better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>Easy to store and travel with.</li>

            <li>This has honestly helped change my self-image so much for the better.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s great to be able to remove body hair whenever I please and not have to wait until I can get someone to do my back.</li>

            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>It is easy to change and easily manageable.</li>
            <li>Easy to use-- works</li>
            <li>I was looking for more of a personal shaver that also had a great cut.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so easy.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>Easy to use, no itchiness afterwards, and it gets so close</li>
            <li>This thing is easy to charge and the angles are easy to adjust.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use...nice to travel with...durable battery...</li>
            <li>Nothing was easy, nothing worked well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Easy to use and works great.&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li>easy to use and convenient.</li>
            <li>Heads change easily and has a locking switch for removing them.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s so easy and adjusts</li>
            <li>Easy to operate.  </li>
            <li>This product is easy to use and removes the hair.  </li>
            <li>So easy to use.</li>
            <li>(haha).&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, this is easy to use and does what it says.  </li>
            <li>I was laughing at how easy it was...</li>
            <li>Easy to use .</li>
            <li>shaver head does not work as good as older model</li>
            <li>I strongly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>After the first couple uses, I had scratches (not the good kind) on my back that honestly kind of hurt.</li>
            <li>Pretty amazing device.</li>
            <li>The battery stayed strong throughout and the reach was fine.  </li>
            <li>MUCH more powerful than the original!</li>
            <li>I have tried everything and this is hands down the best!!</li>
            <li>Just used mangroomer for the first time today, I must say after years of having my girl friend and my son shaving my back, this  item is awesome and easy to use</li>
            <li>The fact that it has a more powerful rechargeable battery is great, and the heads are much more like a traditional trimmer.</li>
            <li>With the extending handle, I was able to do my whole back without engaging the help of my partner, who was also impressed as a result.  </li>
            <li>Great product, exactly as described, make the job a whole lot easier.</li>
            <li>once my brain adjusted it was fine.</li>
            <li>but once I made the adjustment everything was fine.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to use and the cut is smooth.</li>
            <li>and it works just fine.</li>
            <li>and I was able to make quick work of problem areas.  </li>
            <li>Battery charge more than adequate.  </li>
            <li>The hinges feel more solid, the unit is more powerful, and the close shave attachment is very nice.</li>
            <li>You do need to charge the device for 24 hours before your first use, and keep in mind that you need to have a good handheld mirror and a mirror in front of you to do it right.</li>
            <li>My back looks great, device is easy to use.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used the fine trimmer yet, but even the &amp;#34;coarse&amp;#34; trimmer has been great for taking off the bulk of back hair.  </li>
            <li>Luckily the awkwardness goes away as you get more familiar with it.</li>
            <li>However, if you are quite hairy like I am, it will feel like a huge mistake in the 4th hour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li>but this one is a huge improvement.</li>
            <li>the added shaver head is a huge upgrade.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I emailed man groomer and nearly 3 weeks later I have not heard back, man groomer is a great product but what good is a great product when you cannot charge it up and the company refuses to assist you&lt;br</li>
            <li>On that note I will say that I didn&#x27;t notice a huge improvement with the boost, but it didn&#x27;t detract from it either.&lt;br /&gt;-Shaving</li>
            <li>Great back hair shaver!</li>
            <li>Fantastic device.  </li>
            <li>But this shaver works great for the back!</li>
            <li>IT IS A GREAT WAY TO ATTACK, HAIR ON YOUR BACK.</li>
            <li>in all, great product, just hoping the Ultimate Pro doesn&#x27;t die after a year</li>
            <li>I like the rechargeable batteries with charge indicator light</li>
            <li>Fortunately this type of body hair seems to grow slower than scalp hair....</li>
            <li>LOL, or no shirt, at the gym and won&#x27;t have to feel like people might be whispering about back hair</li>
            <li>Great in taking hair of the back.</li>
            <li>Comfortable to use.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Frankly, it got so close as to make me feel smooth as silk.</li>
            <li>Also, if I remember correctly, replacement heads are available.</li>
            <li>so I didn&#x27;t want a cheap flimsy shaver</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is light so you can hold it and maneuver it.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It takes a minute or two to get the hang of it, but once you do it&#x27;s smooth sailing.</li>
            <li>Holds charge well and shaves relatively smooth.</li>
            <li>It works great, only wish Id have made the investment years ago.  </li>
            <li>This one is amazing, no hassle and much time</li>
            <li>Great gift for the man with a hairy back!!!</li>
            <li>Each blade head has a spring joint which enhances flexibility and helps for a comfortable shave.</li>
            <li>The foil head, although not as close as a razor blade, gives a relatively smooth finish.</li>
            <li>Great back shaver.</li>
            <li>, I took a punt on this shaver and really didn&#x27;t expect much to be honest</li>
            <li>The shaves are comfortable.  </li>
            <li>Blade is cheaply made.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately (or fortunately in this case) I dropped it and broke the tab that held the blades in</li>
            <li>Works fantastic.</li>
            <li>no sensitivity, no nothing... except smooth skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This shaver is a great alternative to regular electric clippers.</li>
            <li>overall a great product for men...</li>
            <li>Ever since then, I&#x27;ve been happy with the results of this back shaver.  </li>
            <li>Great tool for shaving the back and neck area.  </li>
            <li>Fabulous.</li>
            <li>Just fabulous.</li>
            <li>Baboon is smooth now.</li>
            <li>Great for shaving back when your alone.</li>
            <li>Fantastic product.</li>
            <li>If you need to take hair off your back and have to do it yourself, this works great.</li>
            <li>The build quality is excellent, the product is well constructed of heavy gauge materials.  </li>
            <li>Charging indicator light shows it as fully charged but the power button does nothing.  </li>
            <li>and it works fantastic.  </li>
            <li>It is AWESOME, and when I had trouble with the clipper and shaver head, I wrote to the company</li>
            <li>This worked great to shave my hairy back</li>
            <li>It will feel and sound like you are breaking it</li>
            <li>Reach is great but requires multiple passes.</li>
            <li>and it is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>This is more useful if someone else is using it on your backside.</li>
            <li>the heck is this?&amp;#34; So I read the fantastic reviews and ordered it.</li>
            <li>Just get it and enjoy the results</li>
            <li>The description makes it sound like it&#x27;s a cakewalk</li>
            <li>Was an excellent device to shave your back hair, I just decided that I really didn,</li>
            <li>I had the Professional model for about 4 years and loved it</li>
            <li>So far so good, lets hope it lasts a while.</li>
            <li>My husband loved his old man groomer</li>
            <li>Had the original and this thing is a far superior product.</li>
            <li>all super..many thanks!!!</li>
            <li>Thanks to the person who invented this,  wish I would have had this item years ago!!!</li>
            <li>thanks Mangroomer!!!</li>
            <li>When this is not an option because you don&#x27;t have the necessary help available, the mangroomer saves the day!!!</li>
            <li>This is a very useful trimmer</li>
            <li>Both heads are very useful.</li>
            <li>Very useful tool well constructed and sturdy.</li>
            <li>Seems very powerful.  </li>
            <li>It has made my grooming quick and easy, and accurate.</li>
            <li>It is quick, easy, and very effective at shaving your back.</li>
            <li>Works as advertised, making it quick and easy to reach those troublesome patches of hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s totally worth the price, just keep it clean and don&#x27;t get the head get corroded!</li>
            <li>At age 40, it seems like the hair from my head is retreating, from their once proud position at the front of my scalp, to an much more defensible position, hidden by my shirt.  </li>
            <li>The single blade cutter gets very close but the best is the foil head with the dual clipping edges.</li>
            <li>Be sure to charge the shaver first before using.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a significant improvement.  </li>
            <li>Finally a back groomer someone can do on their own!  </li>
            <li>so much better than the first generation model .</li>
            <li>I felt like Indiana Jones in the original Raiders of the Lost Ark.  </li>
            <li>This is worth every penny!  </li>
            <li>Had then original.</li>
            <li>Seems to be an improvement over the original.</li>
            <li>Worked okay the first time.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really useful and it gets the job done!</li>
            <li>Works great, but needs a little better battery life.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that you can now shave your back on your own.</li>
            <li>/&gt;...now I just have to clean my bathroom...</li>
            <li>t want to be clean shaven after-all and gave it to a friend.</li>
            <li>This thing is a life saver, now I can clean up without having to ask for help.</li>
            <li>This is my third one and is by far the best model I&#x27;ve had.</li>
            <li>This by far is the best to shave your back!</li>
            <li>Extremely useful and easy to use.</li>
            <li>I think so far the best solution is to ask your partner to remove your back hair!!</li>
            <li>Works Great and is worth the money, my husband says he enjoys this a lot better than other shavers he has used!</li>
            <li>It feels kinda cheap at the extension, but other than that its great</li>
            <li>But after I showed her what did it, she now does not refuse to help out specially if I do it myself and I miss a spot or two.</li>
            <li>Best part is I didnt need to ask for help to get any hard to reach places.</li>
            <li>The folding handle is excellent at allowing you to reach those hard to get at areas.  </li>
            <li>It seemed like such a brilliant idea and I had high hopes.</li>
            <li>you are a genetic fur ball but don&#x27;t particularly enjoy the look when wearing a tank top, I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>This shaver is well made, it&#x27;s fairly solid and has good adjustments for angles and length.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s way way sturdier, the rubber handle makes it much easier to grip, and it&#x27;s 100 times more stable when having it extended or positioned in any way.</li>
            <li>Shaving is NOT an option unless you are cool with devoting one hour of 5 a day to dealing with stubble.</li>
            <li>Works good but can cause some arm strain when shaving the back.</li>
            <li>My advice would be to skip this and go full on razor adapter like the Razorba or something.</li>
            <li>As someone that has a good amount of back hair this machine is a gift from the gods.</li>
            <li>I love this thing and would highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>I liked the old one</li>
            <li>Received it in the mail 2 days, (cool packaging) charged it up overnight and tried it out.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It takes a bit getting used to with adjusting the length and different angles, but all in all a good purchase.</li>
            <li>Thanks to this magic wand</li>
            <li>The adjustable angle &amp; length allow you to keep the blade in full contact with the area being shaved.</li>
            <li>I even laughed at my contortions to try and reach all areas of my back.</li>
            <li>to keep my back in good shape....</li>
            <li>Good product for a last resort.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Downside... it takes a while to get a full charge but the charge lasts a while.</li>
            <li>I use it every full moon</li>
            <li>Good quality and allows you to reach every part of your back with ease.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s still working on that charge 2 months later, so battery life is good.  </li>
            <li>From a disbeliever to a true fan, thank you.</li>
            <li>It is powerful and gets a close and comfortable shave for an electric razor.  </li>
            <li>It feels just as good as scratching your back</li>
            <li>Does have good power and seems like it will last.</li>
            <li>I wish it was designed so it was more flexible instead of straight and rigid.</li>
            <li>and it is good but never gave a close shave and left you with stubble and</li>
            <li>I love it so much</li>
            <li>Not bad product, catches on your hair once in a while</li>
            <li>I imagine I will get better with it as I become more familiar with it (getting used to using the mirror and things being opposite of what you think in the mirror).</li>
            <li>Does exactly as advertised, easy to use and painless.</li>
            <li>Works as i had hoped it would and very easy to ues only have use it 2 times so far so good</li>
            <li>Other than that great product.</li>
            <li>This is a great product, I have had about a week and use it about every other day.</li>
            <li>I finally decided to take the grooming into my own hands and have not been this happy with a purchase in a long time.</li>
            <li>I used this for the first time today and though it shaved the hair off fine</li>
            <li>back, shoulders and arms are nice and smooth every time.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice to have smooth back.</li>
            <li>Gets rid of unwanted hair super quick, wish it had an option of removing the extension handle</li>
            <li>They also have this turbo button that kicks the shaver into hi-gear for super hairy patches.  </li>
            <li>Just got my Mangroomer Ultimate Pro Back Shaver today and it works GREAT!!!  </li>
            <li>It arrived quickly and as described no hassles.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Those are the only 2 things I&#x27;ve noticed that aren&#x27;t &#x27;perfect&#x27;, but they definitely shouldn&#x27;t change your mind about getting this item.</li>
            <li>but I made it quick.</li>
            <li>It is the best and final solution to your back</li>
            <li>When I typed in back shaver, many things popped up, many tools the help extended razors, that involved chemical hair removal, and offered counseling for laser removal.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li>The mangroomer ultimate pro back is awesome.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad that I did, this one has a much more solid feel to it,</li>
            <li>I use the head with the foil on it as that seemed to do the best job and left the back</li>
            <li>this model has much more more power and the hinge locks in position (finally!).  </li>
            <li>once you learn the right angles and makes for a clean finish.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with the purchase of the Mangroomer for several reasons.</li>
            <li>It was fun cleaning the sink full of hair too.  </li>
            <li>My back is completly smooth, and the device is very easy to operate.  </li>
            <li>But I got the hang of it quickly and now am pleased with the product and the ability to remain clean and hair free back there.</li>
            <li>If you could have seen me try to do it with a standard cheap straight edge razor blade, you would have gotten a good laugh.</li>
            <li>After this I won&#x27;t be able to live without one.</li>
            <li>but the new version is much better.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m really stunned how easy this tool makes it.  </li>
            <li>This works very well and is easy to use.</li>
            <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would have to say the overall value of this is pretty good.</li>
            <li>then I would highly recommend this!!!  </li>
            <li>Does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to!</li>
            <li>The Mangroomer works exactly as advertised!</li>
            <li>The first time I has to take a break because of the pain in my neck!</li>
            <li>HIGHLY recommend this product!!!</li>
            <li>I am able to achieve a smooth back but plan on some practice a cool room and plenty of time.</li>
            <li>This works exactly as advertised and was well worth the money!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s nice to be able to handle something by myself which previously required help from my wife.  </li>
            <li>so you can easily reach any spot on your back, and the trimmer just works magic.</li>
            <li>that are about $10 a bottle and can easily cost more in a short period of time, this is a bargain.</li>
            <li>does a great job with little effort</li>
            <li>so make sure you still have something a little more precise for those spots.</li>
            <li>The package was light (good things are heavy).</li>
            <li>The foil head that comes with this model really helps maintain your work and keep things under control and smooth.</li>
            <li>Nice tool, only they need to work on the heads to make them stronger, sharper, and softer on the skin</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s well worth it.</li>
            <li>well worth the money</li>
            <li>Powerful.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s worth it.  </li>
            <li>The foil shaver does an excellent job cleaning up afterwards and left my back soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s 100% worth it.</li>
            <li>Overall a nice shaver for the money.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the $59 bucks just for that.</li>
            <li>It is lightweight but powerful.  </li>
            <li>but it really is worth every penny.</li>
            <li>Seemed light and cheap, but far from it.</li>
            <li>I tried waxing it: temporary success.</li>
            <li>Powerful.</li>
            <li>one tiny nitpick is that I might have liked a case/bag for everything.</li>
            <li>I used to either take almost an hour to do this myself or ask my wife to help which she was kind enough to do</li>
            <li>So much better than the old model.</li>
            <li>Really useful product.  </li>
            <li>but well worth it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
            <li>So far I am quite pleased with the results I am receiving.</li>
            <li>so I felt it was worth trying it out</li>
            <li>Worth every penny and saves from costly hair removal treatments.</li>
            <li>(I expect I&#x27;ll use that blade rarely from now on).</li>
            <li>Love the attachment for short hairs that leaves body smooth without any irritation.  </li>
            <li>As long as the battery lasts I will be very satisfied.</li>
            <li>useful for de-hairing the hairy places.</li>
            <li>but they fell short with the swivel head (i.e., the most important part).</li>
            <li>Overall this is one of a kind product that does the job it says on the package and even more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros</li>
            <li>My old Panasonic was better.  </li>
            <li>I had the old one for a few years and it worked perfectly.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth getting this device.</li>
            <li>So deffinetly worth the investment</li>
            <li>I gave this a shot, and gave a triumphant grunt after its success.</li>
            <li>The effort required to get used to using it well did not feel worth it.</li>
            <li>can see it being useful with some practice.</li>
            <li>It is not as powerful as I was expecting</li>
            <li>The adjustable handle makes this trimmer very useful and the two heads is nice although I do not see me using the regular trimmer head much since the foil head will be used to keep growth under control.  </li>
            <li>I use the wider but less close shaving head as it is quicker and does a very adequate job and feels very good at the same time.  </li>
            <li>Best of all, unlike other trimmers I have used, it leaves no marks on my back or body.</li>
            <li>Better than the original, but, still nothing close to a regular electric or hand razor.</li>
            <li>I have had other back groomers but this is the best I have ever owned.</li>
            <li>but as I got older more and more hair kept showing up back there.</li>
            <li>I received it today and took it out for a quick test, i know you are suppose to charge it first</li>
            <li>It gives a really close shave (not as close as a razor) with very minimal stubble greatly reducing the shaving frequency.  </li>
            <li>Perhaps for high school or college kids this may work fine for them).</li>
            <li>This model is much improved over the original.  </li>
            <li>This version is much improved and worth every penny!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll tell you right now.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;However, his tools were the right ones for the job</li>
            <li>right then I saw that the shaver hats power in it, I immediately ran into the bathroom, pulled off my shirt, looked into the mirror, and said here we go.</li>
            <li>just right as you reach to do the job.</li>
            <li>I threw mine right in the garbage</li>
            <li>but I think it was the right decision.</li>
            <li>It had a charge right out of the box</li>
            <li>This MANGROOMER arrived and I went right to work...</li>
            <li>Strongly recommended to be a part of your  new life style along with beard trimmer.</li>
            <li>This thing is pretty amazing, and makes keeping brush free as pleasant as it possible can, which is not very pleasant after all.</li>
            <li>Much smoother and more efficient, easier to reach areas on my back, the rechargable feature is huge and the added rubber coatings in places makes it seem much more like a professional tool rather than a toy.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have a particularly hairy back, but the ability to clean up the stray hairs is nice.  </li>
            <li>I would much prefer to use this in the shower than have to clean up the bathroom floor</li>
            <li>Very easy to use and the last one I had lasted 6 years.  </li>
            <li>The length of the handle makes it very easy to get all areas of your back.</li>
            <li>won&#x27;t say that it was very easy to do my back</li>
            <li>I actually bought the original man groomer when it first came out many years ago.</li>
            <li>no regrets purchasing this product! :)</li>
            <li>The coarse blade worked fine without any pulling or pinching and the fine shaver cleaned up the remaining stubble well.  </li>
            <li>you can now get a true shave as opposed to just a very close trim&lt;br /&gt;Cons-&lt;br</li>
            <li>Since my screwy hair grows sideways apparently, the &amp;#34;self hug&amp;#34; method seemed most effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Nice, long, adjustable handle.</li>
            <li>It does take a little getting used to the different angles and determining the best arm to use and the right way to use it</li>
            <li>shaver works great all over my body and when my beard gets super chick it chops it right off no problems, I have used it on my upper pubic area directly below my stomach but wont dare to use it on the sensitive parts below that, it is just too powerful and the blade is unguarded</li>
            <li>The &amp;#34;clipper&amp;#34; attachment does great, but I am not a fan of the close up shaver part because it seems to pull a little too much rather then trim.</li>
            <li>so I could use it on other areas more easily.</li>
            <li>I am very happy with this though and like other comments say, it is light and all plastic; however I feel that if it was heavy it would deter me from using it.</li>
            <li>The new attachment gives the skin a smooth finish.</li>
            <li>On a side note, if this is your first unit there is a learning curve to get the technique right</li>
            <li>it gets a much closer shaver - really close and smooth.</li>
            <li>It worked so well that had I not stopped and spent 10 minutes finishing the job, the hairless stripe diagonally across my back would have looked incredibly silly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Enjoy your smooth back.</li>
            <li>Works great, I can finally shave my back myself.</li>
            <li>It would be great for the initial pass, especially if you look like King Kong.</li>
            <li>I owned the previous version and loved that as well</li>
            <li>It took a few minutes to determine the best angle/hand to use, and I felt like looking back in the mirror</li>
            <li>Overall it works well and is easy to clean.</li>
            <li>This one seems to be more powerful and both heads actually do what they&#x27;re supposed to do.</li>
            <li>Unlike most electric razors, you can&#x27;t remove the top part to clean it out, only the bottom part, which leaves me wondering how long this will work till it clogs</li>
            <li>Okay, after wrestling around with trying to find a true man capable groomer (and wasting a lot of money along the way), this actually delivered on it&#x27;s promise.</li>
            <li>Read all the instructions first, and you, too, will have a smooth back free of hair.</li>
            <li>This is as close as you can get to smooth and hair free without the razor and lastly it charges waaaay faster than the first models.</li>
            <li>Build quality is decent, nothing special as well as the foil shaver head.</li>
            <li>I like it very much.</li>
            <li>I have a huge body hair problem.. shaving my chest is easy, shaving my back not so much..</li>
            <li>So far, it works fine.  </li>
            <li>Once you get used to the angles of the device and how to move not only your arms but even your body, you can come away with a smooth, clean shave.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The unit is super solid and is easy to control.  </li>
            <li>It makes reaching your back super easy.</li>
            <li>Works great for all the hard to reach places.</li>
            <li>This is a great trimmer for the hard to reach places.</li>
            <li>Great product to get to the hard to reach places.</li>
            <li>Works great and has plenty of reach for the hard to get to spots</li>
            <li>Eventually, I figured it out; this thing seems to work best with very little pressure against your skin while using a back and forth motion, like you&#x27;re using a back-scratcher.</li>
            <li>It finally broke after dropping it one too many times.  </li>
            <li>First, the item arrived on time, second, it works very well, and third, I was happy to find out that batteries were not required.</li>
            <li>So, I&#x27;m not a fake reviewer.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll wonder why you waited after the first use.</li>
            <li>eh, mediocre item at best.</li>
            <li>and all it&#x27;s working exactly as I would like it to.</li>
            <li>This worked well on the first try with no missed spots and I would buy it again.  </li>
            <li>It does exactly what it is meant to do with ease.</li>
            <li>Be patient the first time, even a weed wacker gets stuck once and a while.</li>
            <li>at first I was worried I was going to break it.</li>
            <li>The power button is a bit touchy and if you put it in a suitcase chances are that it will start buzzing at the first touch.</li>
            <li>mode with the initial trimmer, getting most of the length gone.  </li>
            <li>The second pass with the alternate shaver head leaves a smooth surface on the skin while catching the stray missed hairs from the first pass.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping!</li>
            <li>This item was very well made!</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t had my back this smooth since my now ex-wife used to trim it!</li>
            <li>Now I should say that I was one of the first of my friends growing up to get body/facial hair.</li>
            <li>Evidently, gone are the days where guys who shave their bodies are not the norm.</li>
            <li>I feel so much better about myself and cannot wait until the next vacation or pool party</li>
            <li>Ok so I have hair on my back and it has always been something that has not helped with my confidence.</li>
            <li>I used this for the first time today.  </li>
            <li>It took a lot of pressure and many strokes to get the job done on my back.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t pull the hair even on the first use.</li>
            <li>I love not having to Nair my husband&#x27;s back.</li>
            <li>a try the moment it arrived and did not bother to charge it first.  </li>
            <li>I was a bit sceptical at first.</li>
            <li>it does exactly what it says it&#x27;s made for.</li>
            <li>, I was married at one point</li>
            <li>and my wife wasn&#x27;t exactly turned on by it</li>
            <li>The first mangroomer I had stop working.</li>
            <li>Possibly the most valuable invention known to mankind.</li>
            <li>and then I just started using a hair clipper and many different configurations, including duct taping an extension to it, which didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>Not a close shave but pretty close.</li>
            <li>I was able to shave my back in about 5 minutes</li>
            <li>the first use with the attachment for longer hair</li>
            <li>Everyone&#x27;s hair will grow at different rates but I have been pleased with the time it takes before I need to trim again.</li>
            <li>I have yet to charge it again, that&#x27;s using the &amp;#34;boost&amp;#34; feature on my first shave.</li>
            <li>My boyfriend says the Pro model has a better reach and has an extra attachment for a closer shave.</li>
            <li>Love this makes my back feel so much better, don&#x27;t have pulling hair on my back, or my butt.</li>
            <li>I was sceptic all but willing to give it a try.  </li>
            <li>My first go with Mangroomer</li>
            <li>t sstopped working after first use.</li>
            <li>Does not charge after first use.</li>
            <li>and then it&#x27;s out of control and then finally have to ask, and it&#x27;s more embarrassing.</li>
            <li>I cant say its old school razor blade smooth</li>
            <li>and my back has never looked better.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This was the first time I had used a product like this</li>
            <li>It does exactly what it&#x27;s meant for.</li>
            <li>But its still better than trying to do it with regular clippers.</li>
            <li>LOVE THE MANGROOME ULTIMATE!!</li>
            <li>bought their lower end model when it first came out.</li>
            <li>I was able to reach all the contours of my back with ease.  </li>
            <li>Works Exactly as stated.</li>
            <li>Much better than my last Mangroomer.  </li>
            <li>thanks Mangroomer!</li>
            <li>Timely and efficient and exactly what was ordered.</li>
            <li>After some practice I was able to manipulate the shaver to hit all the areas of my back.  </li>
            <li>Overall I&#x27;m pleased with the product performance.</li>
            <li>The power button has a problem ,  the first one would not power off</li>
            <li>My first 30-second impression of using it was one of concern; it didn&#x27;t seem to be taking anything off.</li>
            <li>Once I figured that out, I was able to make fairly short work of things.</li>
            <li>This is exactly what I needed.  </li>
            <li>This thing does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do.  </li>
            <li>Does not provide a close shave and need to run over the same area many times to remove all hair even when using the boost feature.</li>
            <li>I had my wife shave it with clippers, but that isn&#x27;t exactly a turn-</li>
            <li>My first lasted several years and many drops.  </li>
            <li>Cuts good head not wide enough for close shave attachment.</li>
            <li>If you like to use a back scratcher you will love this shaver.  </li>
            <li>so that said it gets 5 stars because that&#x27;s exactly what it does.&lt;br</li>
            <li>the extending handle which actually locks into place makes it much better and easier to use.  </li>
            <li>can 10 minutes after using it for the first time.  </li>
            <li>Whomever designed this swivel head with so much tension should be FIRED!  </li>
            <li>I have tried so many body groomers to shave my back</li>
            <li>Love it just bought this item used it on my back removed all the hair with ease.  </li>
            <li>The finer head could stand to be a big wider for greater efficiency but it gets the job done (just takes a bit longer to do it).  </li>
            <li>I had the first edition that used (2x AA batteries).</li>
            <li>I went shirtless at the pool for the first time in 10 years.</li>
            <li>It does exactly what you want it to do and does it painlessly.  </li>
            <li>I have a pretty hairy back and now it is as smooth as a babies butt!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Surprisingly, I didn&#x27;t have to go over the same area more than once or twice.</li>
            <li>My boyfriend is pretty hairy</li>
            <li>Just follow instructions exactly</li>
            <li>AND THE MANGROOMER WILL NOT FAIL YOU.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It takes no time &amp; little effort, very little effort to feel, in the words of the great Zohan, Silky Smooth!!</li>
            <li>The unit&#x27;s head is easy to clean and I can just rinse it under some water in the sink and it folds to a small size that I can easily put in the medicine cabinet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This works better then any buzzer I&#x27;ve used, super easy to reach trouble spots and doesn&#x27;t cut you at all highly recommend</li>
            <li>-- my back is super smooth.</li>
            <li>After a lot of twisting trying to get the angle right, it took about 25 minutes to get the whole thing done.</li>
            <li>and my whole back was smooth and clean</li>
            <li>It takes a little bit to get used to using in on your back but does a very good job.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not super hairy, kinda just right, lmao.</li>
            <li>This is the only thing that I&#x27;ve found that I can use without help to reach my entire back, it&#x27;s fast and easy and a really great product.  </li>
            <li>This is a replacement for a 4 or 5 year old original model.</li>
            <li>As an owner of the original man groomer, I was happily surprised with this one.</li>
            <li>not so with the new heads, and with the foils attachment its quick to touch up.</li>
            <li>This groomer was not cheap by any means but so far it has worked great.</li>
            <li>It cleans up easily, and folds in half for easy storage.</li>
            <li>Cuts clean and does&#x27;nt cut me like the old one.</li>
            <li>It gave my back a lovely trim without too much effort.</li>
            <li>IT IS MADE HEAVY DUTY as I was EXPECTING  something cheap and light weight!</li>
            <li>Only thing needing to know is when you have it unlocked, you have to put a fair amount of pressure to open it up.</li>
            <li>I really like the foil head attachment and use that most often for my back.  </li>
            <li>This Mangroomer shaver is awesome,it trims back hair like a weed eater,it&#x27;s a whole lot better than its predecessor.</li>
            <li>USE A NICE SMOOTH SLOW TOUCH</li>
            <li>They ended up sending a new Mangroomer Ultimate Pro for free since the original was still under warranty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This does everything you want it to do, easily, however it has 2 pretty big flaws.</li>
            <li>All of the positive reviews here were correct.  </li>
            <li>55 year old Italian man in great shape but too embarassed to take off my shirt in public.</li>
            <li>I have so many gizmos for shaving and trimming that I hesitated for a long time before buying this one</li>
            <li>pretty much does everything it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
            <li>I tried this for the first time, seems to work very well.</li>
            <li>is my first time buying a product that does this haha</li>
            <li>I was able to do my whole back thanks to the way the MANGroomer is designed.</li>
            <li>Well the hardest part of getting a perfectly shaved back in under 10 minutes was getting it out of that ridiculous plastic that everything seems to be packaged in today.</li>
            <li>That gets the fine stubble down to almost smooth skin.</li>
            <li>I have searched high and low and purchased many diff models.</li>
            <li>this is a high quality item that you can use to trim or shave hair on any part of your body, most definitely not just your back.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It trims very close to the skin, but not too close as to cause ingrown hairs and such that I experienced from using other body trimmers like the one Norelco makes.</li>
            <li>They must have put a lot of money into the re-design of the new version and it is well worth it</li>
            <li>Easily shaved my untamed back and front within 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Easy to reach all areas of the back and to hold.</li>
            <li>Specially back is easily reachable</li>
            <li>I can easily reach every area of my back</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the only one I&#x27;ve ever found that&#x27;s fully adjustable and easy to use.</li>
            <li>After years of struggling to reach those points of my back with my own bare hands, and practically dislocating them.</li>
            <li>easy to use and actually removes the hair!!</li>
            <li>I like this shaver make it easy to reach any spot at my back.</li>
            <li>simple easy to use</li>
            <li>It is easy to operate and adjust to different positions.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27; think the head pivots enough to make shaving on a contour easy.</li>
            <li>Although calling the Mangroomer &amp;#34;life-changing&amp;#34; may be a bit of a stretch, it&#x27;s certainly life-enhancing.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I hope this one lasts longer than five years - it certainly looks and feels like it will.</li>
            <li>How smart is that?</li>
            <li>I certainly would recommend it.</li>
            <li>works extremely well and super easy to use</li>
            <li>With hundreds of positive reviews, I don&#x27;t suppose that mine matters a whole lot, but here it is anyway... for the record.</li>
            <li>I was at my point of giving up on this elusive miracle, I saw for the first time with my own eyes the mansgroomer ultimate pro back shaver.</li>
            <li>The new ultimate is a vastly better product.</li>
            <li>I would say fine enough for the perineum but not for the scrotum...</li>
            <li>and then did the fine tuning with the second attachment.</li>
            <li>The teeth are too coarse and it won&#x27;t give you a fine shave.</li>
            <li>so i have some pretty decent growth.  </li>
            <li>As a mixed breed of Native American, Irish, and Italian, I&#x27;m sure my need for purchasing this product can give you a pretty good hint of what hair genes I got out of that mix.</li>
            <li>Easy and quick clean up of light random groups of hair.</li>
            <li>Works pretty good but needs to be charged every other week even though I only use it once a week.</li>
            <li>but with a second hand held mirror and a little time you can get a great result.</li>
            <li>this thing charges fast, cuts hair fast, can reach every part of your body, and did I mention its fast?</li>
            <li>Worked great for a few times but didn&#x27;t turn on after the fourth time using.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s no longer a huge hassle which means I&#x27;m actually doing touch ups each week rather than waiting until it was getting yetti like.  </li>
            <li>Not only did the groomer allow me to get every bit of hair off my back, the additional piece (for close shave) is amazing</li>
            <li>, I really wish they offered replacement parts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It works really well.  </li>
            <li>Now it is gone, thanks to the Mangroomer.</li>
            <li>you have a lot of body hair you have three real options to remove it.</li>
            <li>Any feedback would be appreciated.</li>
            <li>makes fast work of my body hair.  </li>
            <li>My back and balls are smooth.</li>
            <li>I never write reviews but this model really works.  </li>
            <li>Finally, a very workable solution to a problem i have had for years..</li>
            <li>Makes life for hairy dudes that much easier, believe me.</li>
            <li>I really  like this machine i use it twice a week.&lt;br /&gt;You will like as well go get yourself one</li>
            <li>I did not use the foil head yet since the basic head leaves a plenty smooth shave.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve seen the ones that use a straight razor instead, and that just sounds like a recipe for disaster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Now I&#x27;ll be ready for the pool this summer.</li>
            <li>The coarse head to cut longer hairs, then the smooth head to get a closer shave.  </li>
            <li>He had to get used to how much pressure to apply.</li>
            <li>The fit was what you would expect from an OEM product and the quality was totally acceptable.</li>
            <li>and it is light enough to not become tiring.  </li>
            <li>Works very well.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;About 18.5 hours later I got comfortable with the way the unit adjusted/operated and started in.</li>
            <li>Who wants to bother someone with that all of the time?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It was still very close...</li>
            <li>My back is smooth with this device.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Finally, while I just got it and cannot speak to it&#x27;s longevity, I can say that the Mangroomer feels very well made.</li>
            <li>locking it doesn&#x27;t add a whole lot of value.  </li>
            <li>It did not make my back baby smooth but the hair stubble is not visible.  </li>
            <li>It is only visible in light with someone looking close for it.  </li>
            <li>They really need to fix the quality and the design flaws of this unit.  </li>
            <li>then they don&#x27;t really care&lt;br</li>
            <li>Better than expected product.</li>
            <li>This is a well-made tool that accomplishes its purpose very well.</li>
            <li>very well.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li>I looked it over, then plugged in the charger to get it ready for the morning, thinking</li>
            <li>I needed you so much</li>
            <li>Works really well -close shave .</li>
            <li>both cut very well as per my expectations.</li>
            <li>The product works very well and would recommend to anyone.  </li>
            <li>and I am a very hairy dude.</li>
            <li>Works very well.</li>
            <li>My skin is left smooth and hairless after using the shaver.</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>a completely straight position.&lt;br /&gt;-The</li>
            <li>Thanks for this product.</li>
            <li>Product feels durable without weighing too much.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t cut me up, got a very close shave, and</li>
            <li>I can easily keep my back, my ears, and the back of my neck clean shaven.</li>
            <li>I dont really care for some rechargeable things like this</li>
            <li>I was suprice frim the quality and the fast shipment.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>Just as much as my chest.</li>
            <li>This really does work quite well.  </li>
            <li>I have used this a couple times now and really like it.</li>
            <li>The shave is very close, which was one of my concerns.  </li>
            <li>This product works very well.</li>
            <li>it shaves very close, so it works, 3.</li>
            <li>Saves so much time and embarrassment.</li>
            <li>Well, I can&#x27;t really use it.</li>
            <li>Razor works very well and reaches all problem spots.</li>
            <li>I primarily use the latter now on a weekly basis.  </li>
            <li>Is fast, efficient and gets the job done.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very dissapointed with this model .</li>
            <li>Felt like a gentle massage.&lt;br</li>
            <li>; head works really well at trimming it like it was done with a blade.  </li>
            <li>Seems very sturdy and well made</li>
            <li>thanks.</li>
            <li>Works better than I expected.</li>
            <li>Works really well.  </li>
            <li>make Magnum PI look like a hairless wonder and the Mangroomer really does the job.  </li>
            <li>Of course, I didn&#x27;t really give it a chance because it just felt awkward.&lt;br /&gt;Decided to give this version a try and</li>
            <li>It takes some practice to reach everywhere, but with the foil shaving head, the shave is very close.  </li>
            <li>I used to use liquid creme hair remover and that was smelly, a real pain and time consuming.  </li>
            <li>Thanks mandog groomer.</li>
            <li>Does the job and is very efficient.</li>
            <li>Very well built.</li>
            <li>Thanks once again Amazon for prompt delivery to Australia.</li>
            <li>My husband really likes it.</li>
            <li>It gives a very close shave.</li>
            <li>It is much faster and easier to have a girlfriend or whoever you can talk into using a Philips Norelco Bodygroom to do it for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>its very sturdy&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>Thanks to this, atleast I can walk out the door without bringing a sweater with me.</li>
            <li>Thanks You.</li>
            <li>It is very well designed.</li>
            <li>but he really loves this one.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>I give this a REAL five star rating.&lt;br /&gt;Buy</li>
            <li>No one really dreads shaving their face</li>
            <li>Skin irritation at first is normal.</li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t want a unit with a rechargeable battery, but after using the unit a couple of times, I&#x27;m thankful for the rechargeable battery and the increased energy as compared to the disposable-batteries.</li>
            <li>Really like this thing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very durable and gets the job done with a minimum of fuss.</li>
            <li>Product worked better than I expected.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I have been experiencing the age old problem of hair migrating from the top of my head to my back.</li>
            <li>Being cordless means it&#x27;s very easy to maneuver and use without tripping over the cord or dragging half of your bathroom counter contents onto the floor.</li>
            <li>I have had the original Mangroomer for several years, overall it worked fine.</li>
            <li>From back to front, top to bottom and left to right.  </li>
            <li>, I like the shock absorber flex heads, and the angles/extensions make it easy to get the normally unreachable parts of the back.</li>
            <li>The long and flexible handle makes it easy to reach every spot on my body.</li>
            <li>Strong, reliable, long battery life.</li>
            <li>The new super duper model makes the old model look like a preproduction prototype.</li>
            <li>Other than that the shaver is okay.</li>
            <li>One of the other concerns I had was whether or not I&#x27;d be able to use this everywhere</li>
            <li>There are other methods out there for one to consider as I did, but I could not be more happier with the Mangroomer.</li>
            <li>It was originally given as a gag gift several years ago.  </li>
            <li>I had the original one that was battery operated and finally died.  </li>
            <li>I like it better than the other attachment.  </li>
            <li>The &amp;#34;extra head&amp;#34;, which is a foil with regular cutter blades on either side is probably more comfortable than the standard cutter head for most guys, though it is not as wide as the regular cutter, it does cut quite closely.  </li>
            <li>WOW, I am an engineer and this unit is full professional quality..</li>
            <li>Most importantly, it&#x27;s easy to reach any of those places that are normally tough to get to.  </li>
            <li>My husband was able to shave his own back and only missed a few spots.</li>
            <li>I am a women who is young and suffers from back problems with a huge surgery that prevents me from bending, this is awesome for shaving my legs that I can not reach or see to shave.</li>
            <li>/&gt;To be quite honest, I can not tell a single difference using it between the 2 different versions.</li>
            <li>Only operates for a minute or two before it dies, even after full charge.  </li>
            <li>Its pretty loud.</li>
            <li>But WOW - this thing really works!  </li>
            <li>15 minutes ago, I had a back full of hair.</li>
            <li>Finally, a TRUE back shaver!</li>
            <li>Even if you don&#x27;t have a flexible upper body, you should be able to get every spot on your back with absolute ease.</li>
            <li>The first purchase was made with the old model that broke after 1 year of use.  </li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t start using the replacement back shaver until November of 2015 and the double-sided trimmer/foil just recently started to not trim back hair near as good as it first did.</li>
            <li>Not sure why I had to start growing back hair in my late thirties, but am glad to be able to get rid of it now on my own.</li>
            <li>You could feel the stubble if you ran a hand across my back, but really not bad at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The dual clippers are fine enough for some sensitive areas.</li>
            <li>It mowed the stuff down like a weedeater through peachfuzz and my hair is more like that found in a horse hair blanket than flowing silken</li>
            <li>I love it and would recommend this to other guys who need to trim up!</li>
            <li>so I can show-off my new self!</li>
            <li>Charge last more than long enough and the device gets me smooth, no stubbles.</li>
            <li>This ultimate pro is worth the extra $ for the improvements and bells and whistles but the original model will get the job done.</li>
            <li>The new foil head attachment and the flexibility in both heads really help it give you a closer shave.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re not careful, you can scrape yourself a bit, but you just need to keep it at the right angles.</li>
            <li>I felt so bad I upgraded him to the Mangroomer Pro which he loved so much more.</li>
            <li>/&gt;that was fine the first ten years of our marriage, but the last 5 years or so</li>
            <li>No pull, love that I can use this dry and in wet conditions and have the same smooth results!  </li>
            <li>There is a slight pinching feeling but be a man about it and use this product such a smooth easy to use product.</li>
            <li>To be clear it won&#x27;t leave your back razor smooth, but nobody will be tossing you a banana at the pool.</li>
            <li>But it does feel sturdy and has a decent reach.  </li>
            <li>Like this one much better because a) rechargeable battery, b) alternate foil head c) even foil head has traditional blade feature happening</li>
            <li>It broke, which is why I opted to purchase the Super Mega Ultimate Hairy Man</li>
            <li>I decided to go with the ultimate version - (only 10 bucks more).  </li>
            <li>I am a hairy guy on my back and shoulders and this product makes quick work of that.  </li>
            <li>At the purchase price it was a real steal, actually if it was to ever break then I would still re purchase another item even if the price was at $200.00 the product was definitely worth every cent</li>
            <li>Better than last one I bought, wish it had battery back up</li>
            <li>It makes quick work of that Sasquatch hair on your back and chest and anywhere else you wish to use it.  </li>
            <li>It also has cutters on each side which are supposed to catch stray hairs missed by the main cutter.</li>
            <li>My hair is thick and coarse and the trimmer cut through it great.</li>
            <li>Works decent but don&#x27;t expect a miracle.</li>
            <li>It works far better than I expected.</li>
            <li>I used it once, and now the main head no longer works.</li>
            <li>Super flexible shaver that can get just about anywhere on your back.</li>
            <li>each version is better than the last, and the trend continues with the Ultimate Pro.  </li>
            <li>The older I have been getting</li>
            <li>, I have only used the trimmer not the other attachment, but as a life long back shaver I am very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li>however, the first pass cuts it down almost smooth.</li>
            <li>I got it as a Christmas gift for my husband with high hopes of not needing to assist him with his man grooming any longer.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>

            <li>Highly recommend mangroomer</li>
            <li>I would highly suggest to any one not to purchase this product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommends this product</li>
            <li>Highly recmmend for hairy guys like myself.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>First product I&#x27;ve found where I can reach every part of my back without irritating my skin and the build quality is pretty good.</li>
            <li>The handle extends to allow you to reach the lower back and the clippers are very sharp and do a great job of trimming the back hair.</li>
            <li>I was able to do my back and front in 5 minutes flat.</li>
            <li>The size of this shaver makes it easy for even the least agile person to reach every area of the back.</li>
            <li>I am super pleased that I did as in only a few minutes</li>
            <li>This seems to be a considerable improvement over the original in terms of overall quality of design, functionality, and quality.  </li>
            <li>It costs a little more but man</li>
            <li>You cut through my back hair like a hot knife through butter!  </li>
            <li>Just used my Mangroomer Ultimate Pro for the first time!  </li>
            <li>I think they could have done this a little better.</li>
            <li>This time I bought the upgrade and WOW!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok, still having trouble making sure the razor head is FLAT on my back.</li>
            <li>I have used other shavers but nothing as easy to use as this.  </li>
            <li>on time kind of hard to use</li>
            <li>The grip has a nice extension so you can virtually get any hard to reach part of your body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Everyman should own one that has hard to reach hair for removal.  </li>
            <li>This is all or nothing.&lt;br /&gt;Shaving the back was tricky too, while back there, I thought I&#x27;d clean up the rear and ouch!  </li>
            <li>It is not a clumsy plastic like other trimmers and it is easy to use.</li>
            <li>Quick and very little clean up...</li>
            <li>Maybe people with real sensitive skin could have a problem.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping and working without problems so far.</li>
            <li>, I can get a smooth stroke all over those rough terrains.  </li>
            <li>The trimmer works great but the foil head is useless.  </li>
            <li>I am a pretty frugal person, and I have no regrets whatsoever about this purchase.</li>
            <li>Having a hairy back poses self-confidence issues when trying to date, and its always on a mans mind the first time he gets intimate with a lady.</li>
            <li>keeps a charge long and lasts thru a full haircut.</li>
            <li>Just used it the second time today and well worth the money.</li>
            <li>I figured it was just normal chaffing.</li>
            <li>Based on another review I saw it doesn&#x27;t seem worth my time to contact anyone because they only can help if you&#x27;re buying something</li>
            <li>This thing is well-built and goes a long ways on a full charge.</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s powerful enough to handle the job!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just a normal guy that hates to look like a rug.  </li>
            <li>Worth paying extra for the &amp;#34;Pro&amp;#34; with the pivot head.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good product but not Great.  </li>
            <li>Works good but not great.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s heavy duty and cleaning the groomer is fast and easy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using regular beard clippers to get my back hair for some time, and it isn&#x27;t easy, and you don&#x27;t get all of the hair.  </li>
            <li>There are not enough positive  comments I can say about this device!</li>
            <li>Surprisingly good product that does exactly what it says with little fuss or trouble.</li>
            <li>results though were outstanding, absolutely no cuts, red lines and more importantly, no rash.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve yet to use the smaller head because the bigger one seems to work fine.</li>
            <li>Overall, I would recommend purchasing this if it&#x27;s your first Mangroomer or upgrading if you have older models.</li>
            <li>but I just got this new one</li>
            <li>There are two models of the new one...</li>
            <li>so I had to purchase a new one.</li>
            <li>and I have to buy a new head for it.</li>
            <li>I bought this one because of the new close shave head</li>
            <li>I broke it a couple of weeks ago and decided to order a new one.</li>
            <li>would have probably given it 4 stars because I expected it to be a bit more solid...</li>
            <li>This shaver works ok to shave your back, but it will cut you up if you aren&#x27;t careful.</li>
            <li>It left some red marks (light scratches) that disappeared in an hour or so.  </li>
            <li>One note is that it is very loud.</li>
            <li>have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Very surprised at how well this works.</li>
            <li>GREAT FOR OTHER HARD TO REACH AREAS</li>
            <li>/&gt;Two weeks passed and they never responded to my first email, I sent a 2nd email and still no response.</li>
            <li>Larger and much more power and the other head allows for a finer trim.</li>
            <li>Wow!  </li>
            <li>After the first initial charge, I have used the item for quite a while with out it loosing any power.</li>
            <li>I have to add that the first time he used it he did have a couple red marks that stung for a couple days</li>
            <li>I just used my shaver for the first time last night</li>
            <li>But just the same, it worked pretty well.</li>
            <li>The only thing that could possibly make this product ANY better, is another pair of eyes in the back of my head !!</li>
            <li>my man groomer finally died and I went to charge it for the first time, to my surprise</li>
            <li>it blows my old one away!</li>
            <li>The  push button to lock the angle is hardly necessary and you could damage the ratcheting joint if you try to adjust the angle without unlocking it first.</li>
            <li>All I can say about this shaver is Wow!</li>
            <li>I needed the &amp;#34;Power Burst&amp;#34; feature only during the first shave.</li>
            <li>I generally just use the trimmer and not the shaver, so this is really a review of the trimmer.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried everything from waxing to Nair for Men to trying to just embrace the fact that I&#x27;m a furry dude and letting it go but the only thing that has consistently worked for me is the Mangroomer.  </li>
            <li>I got this as a Christmas present and after the first use I am amazed.  </li>
            <li>The flat thin head works great for me.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This was the first back hair trimmer/remover I&#x27;ve ever tried, so I have nothing to compare to the Mangroomer.</li>
            <li>Actually works pretty well.</li>
            <li>No complaints so far!</li>
            <li>I bought this for my son with a pretty furry back.</li>
            <li>WOW!  </li>
            <li>Better than other shavers from the big names which I have tried.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and requires little effort when shaving.</li>
            <li>A little scratched up, so go easy with it when in use.</li>
            <li>As long as I keep up with it, I probably will only need to use the close shave (ie fine tune)&lt;br</li>
            <li>4 minutes ago I was sitting down at my computer, HAIR FREE, to write this review.</li>
            <li>If you got a hairy back like I do than this is exactly what you need, I always had a hard time shaving my back with those small shavers and always needed help, but with this baby it doesnt take more than 5 minutes and the battery lasts a long time, and the best thing about it is that it reaches every single tricky spot.</li>
            <li>Technology has made it easy for the single man to manscape his back.  </li>
            <li>Easy to reach every single contour of the back!</li>
            <li>They fixed it in the new one</li>
            <li>My back hasn&#x27;t looked this hairless or felt this smooth in a really long time.</li>
            <li>wide head makes it a quick job and the handle expands to any length</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was able to do my entire body without recharging and the motor didn&#x27;t seem to be slowing down.</li>
            <li>It does exactly as indicated, reaches all the hard to reach areas on the back to remove that unsightly hair. :)</li>
            <li>It is quick and simple to use and keeps unwanted back and shoulder hair almost invisible.</li>
            <li>However, subsequent shaves are quick enough that it hasn&#x27;t been an issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It makes nicely just a little red marks for few minutes from the metal edge they go away quickly</li>
            <li>Judging by the poor reviews the previous Mangroomers received, this one must be greatly improved because I really like it.  </li>
            <li>Unfortunately, this cuts my skin more easily than an adapter for a regular razor, and doesn&#x27;t shave as close.</li>
            <li>This is not my first Mangroomer, I had the original silver AA battery version for at least 5 years</li>
            <li>Full price is less than a one-time waxing where I live</li>
            <li>Surprisingly, no nicks and cuts but a clean, smooth back...</li>
            <li>It left a little more on my chest than everywhere else</li>
            <li>Works fine, a bit stiff when adjusting but otherwise does the job</li>
            <li>had a problem with my unit: the charging light did not turn green when the charge was complete.</li>
            <li>This is a great groomer for difficult zones like the back.</li>
            <li>clearly states</li>
            <li>, I guess they no longer check emails.that was a complete joke.</li>
            <li>No problems in 6 months of use so far.</li>
            <li>Well maybe I&#x27;m sensitive.</li>
            <li>Reaches just where I can&#x27;t to complete my manscaping process.</li>
            <li>So of course I needed to use his old electric razor to finish the job.</li>
            <li>Cons - None so far.</li>
            <li>Wow</li>
            <li>and I receommend to any dude who hates their back and wants it removed effortlessly.</li>
            <li>Use it frequently.</li>
            <li>Very helpful if you don&#x27;t have someone to help you shave your back.</li>
            <li>This thing made it trivial to make it completely disappear.  </li>
            <li>Holds a charge forever and as long as your consistent</li>
            <li>One of the issues I faced is that there really wasn&#x27;t a place to &amp;#34;stop shaving&amp;#34; if I had someone shave my back which meant shaving my &amp;#34;front&amp;#34; and arms too.</li>
            <li>Wow.  </li>
            <li>I had the old Mangroomer.</li>
            <li>The bigger head caused way to much scratching of the skin.</li>
            <li>And if you take it on a trip, the button is so sensitive that it will turn on in your luggage and die.  </li>
            <li>I was like wow,</li>
            <li>wow,</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to absolutely anyone who wishes to keep back hair away -</li>
            <li>also customer service is terrific and very responsive.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Let&#x27;s preface this by saying that I have been embarrassed by back hair my whole life.</li>
            <li>and I had so much time left over</li>
            <li>So far I like it... .works</li>
            <li>Used a couple times so far</li>
            <li>This thing can carve through anything and actually gets a very close to the skin shave without having any ingrown hairs at all.  </li>
            <li>I have te old version of this</li>
            <li>/&gt;After the initial overnight charge, I was able to mow my entire back and upper arms with no noticeable loss of power.  </li>
            <li>and I would have to give it a day or so to clear up, so far</li>
            <li>I defintely have some back hair and this really takes care of it.</li>
            <li>WOW.</li>
            <li>I would not consider myself a sensitive skinned person either.</li>
            <li>in all I am very please with this second iteration of the man groomer.</li>
            <li>If you are, like me, a big furry fellow, you really owe it to yourself to try this thing.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Not loud, and it works as described in the companies material.  </li>
            <li>This trimmer had no trouble with it.  </li>
            <li>No problem so far with it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 52 and have struggled with this since it grew in when I was in my early 20&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>Charged all night and the light is green</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s ready to go by the next morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>No complaints so far.</li>
            <li>but really ruff on the back.</li>
            <li>far as models go...</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t want completely off.</li>
            <li>They say that head swivels, but there&#x27;s so much resistance in the swivel that it might as well just be a solid mount.  </li>
            <li>No complaints so far.</li>
            <li>Having a hairy back is very embaressing.</li>
            <li>Holds a charge very well and is simple to use.  </li>
            <li>for my sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Come on &amp;#34;ManGroomer&amp;#34; NiCad and NiMh are old technology.</li>
            <li>It really does work, it will remove your back hair with no</li>
            <li>Surprisingly near to none irritation on my baby</li>
            <li>Used it one time so far.</li>
            <li>I guess, I&#x27;ll have replace my old Norelco Body Groom with another one.</li>
            <li>I buzz my head and my buzzer isn&#x27;t even as loud as this.</li>
            <li>takes care of that bothersome back hair really well</li>
            <li>this first and save your money in the long run.</li>
            <li>Looks much cleaner than it was though, and I won&#x27;t send it back</li>
            <li>Asking another person to do your back is too much.</li>
            <li>I also applaud the customer service team who sent me another complete product after I had some minor defects with a blade attachment on the first one I received in the mail.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t go wrong with this brand they are well made ( I&#x27;ve had good luck</li>
            <li>The mangroomer is wonderful for those of us living alone with no significant other to trim those hard to reach hairs off our backs.</li>
            <li>The design makes it great if all you want to do is shave your back, but it&#x27;s way too clumsy for other areas.</li>
            <li>Product performs as expected and advertised except for ability to shave your own back due to angle of head</li>
            <li>My back was silky smooth in less than 20 minutes after getting it out of its package (which itself was no small feat).</li>
            <li>The trimmer has plenty of power for even thick hair, and the included close shaver (foil screen) does a decent job at keeping things smooth.</li>
            <li>I was skeptical before purchasing this razor, but found it to be both effective and of decent quality.</li>
            <li>For the price, I don&#x27;t think it would even be worth messing around with cheaper models or other brands.  </li>
            <li>I know two other men who use this, and we all agree this is very much worth the money.</li>
            <li>I was a little hesitant at first, but after trying it on my shoulder and not having it catch once, I jumped right in and started on my back.  </li>
            <li>and they sent me an ENTIRELY brand new unit!  </li>
            <li>I recently purchase their new Ultimate Pro with Shock Absorbing Head.  </li>
            <li>and I will still need to spend more money on another product that hopefully will work better :(</li>
            <li>Had the standard model and was not happy with it decided to try the pro and was Very pleased with it</li>
            <li>The Mangroomer Ultimate Pro Back Shaver is really a simple and quick way to get the job done.</li>
            <li>It comes with 2 different heads, one for removing longer hair, which you&#x27;ll likely need for the first use, and a closer shaving head for maintenance.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it to anyone struggling with back hair.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend to anybody with back hair problems</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it if you require any back grooming.</li>
            <li>If you have troublesome back hair, i highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I called the phone number on their website for General Information, that was a complete joke.</li>
            <li>No more waxing and now I feel comfortable wearing singlets/gym tops without the hassle and comments from close friends and work colleagues.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like gentle fingers massaging you all day long.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t believe how much time I have wasted with my regular hair buzzer to clean my back.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ll go back to using a cheap disposable razor and a little flexibility.</li>
            <li>A little awkward but after you get the hang of it you will be happy you can reach spot by yourself!</li>
            <li>How else can one by himself dispose of the hair in those hard to reach places so easily?</li>
            <li>This makes shaving the hard to reach places extrememly easy.  </li>
            <li>It took me at least 45 minutes to get most of what I want, and as of this review I am still not done, I can only imagine how long it would have taken me if I really had a lawn to mow (so to speak)..</li>
            <li>/&gt;I will say that it does take some time to get use to, and you will occasionally drag an edge over your back rather than the full cutting head, but after a while it will become quick and somewhat easy.</li>
            <li>Know this though, it is NOT fine enough for the &amp;#34;sack&amp;#34; or the &amp;#34;taint&amp;#34; but it is fine for the &amp;#34;crack&amp;#34; (and the rest) if you stretch the skin.</li>
            <li>so I went to buy it from amazon and noticed they just release this new version of their back shaver.  </li>
            <li>I emailed them and within 12 hours they had emailed me back and will be sending me a new product.  </li>
            <li>retreating hairs in their new position on my back.  </li>
            <li>not sure why the  Mangroomer website says they have a toll free number for General Information, they have an answering service that tells you to email the company for information.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure why the  Mangroomer website says they have a toll free number for General Information, they have an answering service that tells you to email the company for information.</li>
            <li>emailed the company about 2 weeks ago to ask them why they thought the double-sided trimmer/foil isn&#x27;t trimming back hair very well since I have only been using it for 3 months.</li>
            <li>I didnt think it would be such a simple and affective as it really is.</li>
            <li>It really works well and does its purpose, definitely an upgrade from the last model!</li>
            <li>The instruction say that the initial charge should be 16 hours, my green light kicked on after about 3, however I let it go for 16 as instructed.</li>
            <li>My hair is medium/thick and my skin is not especially resistant to cuts, but I really did not notice any scrapes or cuts on my back.</li>
            <li>The only problem I had was I would forget to buy batteries when I needed them, since my old one is 5 years old</li>
            <li>really, you&#x27;ve made the decision to get something like this, spend the extra money and get the Ultimate.</li>
            <li>It would be really time consuming to do the entire back.</li>
            <li>Now, finally, I can shave the hair on my back and feel much cleaner.</li>
            <li>BUT, he attempted using it for the first time the other night</li>
            <li>I used this product for the first time the other day.  </li>
            <li>Major manufacturer flaw causes the heads to break quickly!!&lt;br</li>
            <li>Easy to use, and no more hair on his back.  </li>
            <li>I used to almost dislocate my shoulders trying to use a standard hair trimmer, but now I can easily use a small mirror and stand backwards in front of my bathroom mirror and mow my trap/delt lawn.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It took me less than 20 min to shave my legs and full upper body.</li>
            <li>Takes no more than 10 minutes now including clean up.  </li>
            <li>I usually drop all my shaver product&#x27;s heads in alcohol to clean between usage.  </li>
            <li>It does cover the back area ok, but is not all that easy to keep the clippers angled properly for the hard to reach small area of the back.</li>
            <li>You would require at least 2 passes for a smooth shave.</li>
            <li>Battery has a long enough charge to shave whole body with plenty of power.</li>
            <li>It charges quite fast and the battery last a long time.</li>
            <li>It is very well built, and I think it will last me a long time.</li>
            <li>and my hair is not thick, but gets long after a month of not shaving.  </li>
            <li>The hair on my back is not thick but there is enough there for me to be self contiouse about it.</li>
            <li>This thing barely works.</li>
            <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did recruit my adult daughter once, but she only agreed to it after I threatened to ask her Boyfriend to shave me instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So far, I am a big fan</li>
            <li>I use it once a month, just to maintain my bare skin.</li>
            <li>What an improvement, with the old one even after my back got used to the shave</li>
            <li>Such an improvement over early model.</li>
            <li>I was surprised just how big and clunky this thing is.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in my early forties now and have been twisting myself into Houdini-esque contortions for the last 20 years in an attempt to keep my back clear of the fur that insists on growing there.</li>
            <li>If you are not careful, you can get scratched.</li>
            <li>The problem is that the trimmer does the same job that the old one does but looks difference and has a flexible head.  </li>
            <li>The first one I got crapped out after only 2 uses, but the replacement has been working very well for the past month, and</li>
            <li>/&gt;The only benefit thing has is the reach action.</li>
            <li>My only problem is how loud the device is.</li>
            <li>I have used it several times so far</li>
            <li>It did feel like it would pinch on sensitive areas of my back by the lats.  </li>
            <li>This product arrived earlier than I expected thanks to Amazon!  </li>
            <li>But I used this on my back and chest and now look like a normal human being.</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s expensive and honestly embarrassing.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Other reviewers got it right about a little bit of learning curve with this.</li>
            <li>THAT MAKES IT EASY TO MANEUVER THE HARD TO GET AREAS OF YOUR BACK.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, you can achieve the same result with a little help from a significant other...or friend who will help you out, if you have a regular electric and/or blade</li>
            <li>Back hair sucks, but this makes it so easy to get rid of.  </li>
            <li>Powerful and cuts well but is dangerous to use in hard-to-reach spots that you can&#x27;t see because it is easy to cut yourself</li>
            <li>They have upgraded it from previous models and it has locking hinges and is now sturdy enough to actually be useful.  </li>
            <li>This is worth the extra money when compared to the previous two mangroomer versions.</li>
            <li>a little long then the single blade head would leave) and left my stomach very smooth.</li>
            <li>Although I have received both electrolysis and laser hair removal in the past, I still have fine, but stubborn hair on my mid to lower back</li>
            <li>The red button on the front of the trimmer intensifies the trim by at least double the power and is great  for thick haired  areas or just generally a quicker trim.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had tried other methods in the past and they do work most times but almost all of them that work require someone else to shave/</li>
            <li>This shaver will not operate while the charger is plugged in (an annoying feature of all shavers of this type) but most people should be able to complete their shave long before the battery runs low.</li>
            <li>Also with the different heads and the REAL locking mechanisms I can use this in any position and not feel it will break loose on me.</li>
            <li>The shaver went smoothly as I went up and down my back sometimes tilting it sideways to grab coarse parts, that night, not a single bit of hair was left across my back.</li>
            <li>the nature of the extension piece makes it awkward to trim your chest or face so you will need a second trimmer if you wish to go full body smooth.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t have a use for the other one.</li>
            <li>so there was enough to hair to present what I would consider full growth on me (not super dense growth but enough to be self-conscious about).  </li>
            <li>Not a single catch, not a single scratch, not a single drop of blood.  </li>
            <li>The only thing holding me back from a 5 star rating is that I owned the Professional version 1 year ago.</li>
            <li>I received my MANGrooomer Ultimate Pro in 2 days (even in the midst of  snow storm) as expected and it was packaged very well.</li>
            <li>On my first shave, I used the wide blade to remove long hair</li>
            <li>This is a good item to purchase it makes shaving that nasty back hair easy</li>
            <li>, it makes a difficult job very easy.  </li>
            <li>but i just purchased my second one after having the first for a year and a half.</li>
            <li>It removed the hair so short you could barely seeit.</li>
            <li>For the first time in my adult life, I have no more unwanted back hair.  </li>
            <li>It trims my difficult to reach back hair nicely with the standard head, and the &amp;#34;shaver&amp;#34</li>
            <li>The motor did bog down some in thicker hair even with the extra power boost but after the first trim regular trimming shouldn&#x27;t be a problem.</li>
            <li>but I had to track down scissors, which is unusual for me.</li>
            <li>I find it a bit difficult to get it flat on my back and end up catching the sides with the cutters rather than the foil itself.</li>
            <li>Gives a high quality body trim without the contortions required from other products.  </li>
            <li>but it is VERY close without the mess.</li>
            <li>It will leave a sharp stubble (normal attachment)&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>/&gt;First off, I may seriously consider scheduling my Back Maintenance days to coincide with my Clean</li>
            <li>My back has been covered in long thick hair since high school (a real BigFoot situation)</li>

            <li> and it&#x27;s perfect for the &amp;#34;as close as possible&amp;#34; shave without getting to razor level (ingrown hairs), although this may give the razor look for thinner</li>
            <li> you can knock it all out in one sitting, but I&#x27;ve found that it works best if you chip away day by day.</li>
            <li> It is Awesome!  </li>
            <li> I began to research, via Amazon, the best method/device to handle this issue.  </li>
            <li> I found the best results when I went by feel and would check my work in the mirror.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m totally impressed with the results!  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s awesome.</li>

            <li> it maintains a nice and shorn body!</li>
            <li> so I bought him this, and he&#x27;s on his own!</li>
            <li> It will cut through the thickest hair and the battery life is remarkable.</li>
            <li> He said this shaver took some getting used to --- as in how to hold it for successful results --- but otherwise it worked well for him.</li>
            <li> Works great and has good reach.</li>
            <li> He loves the way it works, and we&#x27;re both very happy with the results...nice and smooth!</li>

            <li> Excellent groomer that works very well.</li>
            <li> beats the heck out of the kind that uses a disposable razor.</li>
            <li> To be honest, i didn&#x27;t use the foil head at all to go super-smooth.</li>
            <li> Flexible head is a nice feature.  </li>
            <li> The feel is nice.</li>
            <li> Kinda meh to be honest.  </li>
            <li> This is a nice alternative to the hair removal products out on the market.</li>
            <li> From what I can tell it looks nice.</li>
            <li> Having a rechargeable battery is a nice touch too.</li>
            <li> Nice product,  before making a decision you need to make 10 shaves or so to both get used to the product and allow your skin to adjust.</li>
            <li> look very good but what can you do right?  </li>
            <li> This was a great update from the original.  </li>
            <li> I had the original Remington body groomer before and it was great until it broke.</li>
            <li> I had the original man groomer in 2011 which cost 19.99 and it worked great</li>
            <li> Everyone wins!!!</li>
            <li> This unit works as well as she did, lol, thus I don&#x27;t have to ask anybody and it shaves close and does a pretty darn good job.  </li>
            <li> The foil head does a great clean up job.  </li>
            <li> The foil blade is especially effective and is the best solution I&#x27;ve ever had for removing my body hair - it usually cuts the hair in one or two passes.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use and is extremely effective for self grooming.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with the way this works, like the look and highly recommend it</li>
            <li> I have used the normal head and the speed boost and find that works best for me.  </li>
            <li> Very well made, ive tried ever else as far as machines, this is the best, got 2 of my friends to but as well, very happy with this purchase</li>
            <li> Very safe, easy and satisfying!</li>
            <li> But the best thing is the new head.  </li>
            <li> this is the best darn piece of equipment I own by far.  </li>
            <li> I have used it twice and charged once, so battery life seems good, and it&#x27;s still going strong.  </li>
            <li> The power is strong and length of handle is good.  </li>
            <li> Very easy to use.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is very easy to use</li>
            <li> This is sturdy, with a very strong motor.  </li>
            <li> The heads remove and install very easily.  </li>
            <li> Very easy to use</li>
            <li> ( I&#x27;m sure there are better ways!)</li>
            <li> Best so far !</li>
            <li> sure would be nice</li>
            <li> It sure would be nice is</li>
            <li> Great product and well worth the money.</li>
            <li> Great product, worth every</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s the best thing I&#x27;ve found so far.</li>
            <li> My hubby loves this, it&#x27;s easy to use and is sturdy!</li>
            <li> So easy to use and works wonders!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s easy, yes, you should do yourself (and your woman) a favor and buy this!</li>
            <li> The Mangroomer gets a remarkable close shave in a quick amount of time.</li>
            <li> smooth edges, nice grip, nice positions, buttons etc.  </li>
            <li> I was able to do it, but it wasn&#x27;t very easy.</li>
            <li> The first 2-3 hours after clipping the hair you&#x27;ll feel great.</li>
            <li> Great product, exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> I will first admit that I have always been proud of my body hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m pretty happy with it.</li>
            <li> I haveno idea of how reliable the mangroomer will prove, but I&#x27;m happy with the first results.</li>
            <li> Great product that does exactly what it says.</li>
            <li> I super recommend this thing works wonders!!</li>
            <li> Nice product, easy to use</li>
            <li> Amazingly easy to use and effective.</li>
            <li> The product is easy to use, durable (from what I can tell so far) and does its job flawlessly!</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure if the lever was supposed to move freely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I sent 3 more emails and still no response</li>
            <li> I sent 3 more emails and still no response</li>
            <li> even more so.  </li>
            <li> This one is built so much better.</li>
            <li> I love that it&#x27;s rechargable instead of having to use 2 AA batteries.</li>
            <li> *** having to make sure you always have spare batteries sitting around in case</li>
            <li> So I love that it&#x27;s rechargable</li>
            <li> how many years I will get out of the battery.</li>
            <li> I have not used the foil head just yet as the regular head does an excellent job.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve done it many times ), laser treatment and electrolysis.</li>
            <li> Works better than its brother unit without the extension.  </li>
            <li> and they would have been more effective&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> It should be able to get a closer cut than it does.</li>
            <li> Love the tool.</li>
            <li> best back shaver ever made use it for my head as well!!</li>
            <li> The handle has an adjustable angle which is just perfect for getting anywhere on the back.</li>
            <li> I love that the battery for the Mangroomer even came charged.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> but I love it.  </li>
            <li> Glad I don&#x27;t have to use this</li>
            <li> It needs to be 2 times wider or more.</li>
            <li> Just make sure you keep your receipt and any pertinent info to redeem a warranty replacement!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love this Product.</li>
            <li> This version is clearly much more durable.&lt;br /&gt;Pros-&lt;br</li>
            <li> love the mangroomer...</li>
            <li> All I can say about the clipper head is BEST BACK SCRATCHER EVER!!!  </li>
            <li> Okay - I&#x27;ll admit.</li>
            <li> (you now that spot when you have an itch and can&#x27;t reach :).  </li>
            <li> and my back was looking great!!!  </li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> Now I don&#x27;t have to shave him anymore  :-)</li>
            <li> Best Product Ever for Back Shaving!!!!</li>
            <li> If you travel its better if you put it in the suitcase discharged so ther will be no surprises at the airport.</li>
            <li> This is a seriously good product and well worth the money.  </li>
            <li> Felt a need to write another review about how much I love this thing.  </li>
            <li> The shaver works greater than any I&#x27;ve come across for the price.  </li>
            <li> , Alway&#x27;s a Bear&amp;#34; :)</li>
            <li> I thought for sure I was going to end up one of those guys with the &amp;#34;hair type&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I was able to maneuver the MANGroomer so as to get everything trimmed up - arms, legs, torso, etc.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m sure that will change with time and practice.  </li>
            <li> But this device is a sure thing.  </li>
            <li> I use it twice a week and feel better about myself.  </li>
            <li> I have a lot more confidence in myself about using this.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, this iteration is OUTSTANDING.</li>
            <li> This is an outstanding product.</li>
            <li> I just love this product.  </li>
            <li> Using it takes some time to make sure the shaving head is hitting square on the part of the body shaved, but the adjustable arm makes it foolproof.</li>
            <li> Excellent product for back hair</li>
            <li> Fabulous!</li>
            <li> but it is more than sufficient for me.  </li>
            <li> Without a doubt the best lifestyle and personal grooming purchase I have ever made.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this thing.</li>
            <li> worry free!  </li>
            <li> My expectations of this product are completely satisfied.</li>
            <li> This one is much better.</li>
            <li> Again, more hyperbole.</li>
            <li> The best and easiest way to take care of back hair.  </li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t think it was ever &#x27;sexy&#x27;.  </li>
            <li> Best gift I ever got for my boyfriend and for myself since I no longer have to shave his back.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad that I found this before trying something like that.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and they keep getting better.</li>
            <li> Works great - fast and efficient.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> This is the best back shaver I have ever owned.</li>
            <li> When there&#x27;s more hair growing on your body than your head, you need something like this.  </li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> it did a tad bit more.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;d better stop eating cakes etc.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Wonderful for the back, but also great for whole body.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, told girlfriend that I had my back shaved at a message parlor by a Gehia girl, since she refused to do so, so many times.</li>
            <li> , I am glad I did.</li>
            <li> I love this thing.</li>
            <li> i feel more confident being able to take my shirt off now</li>
            <li> , I did many rounds of laser hair removal</li>
            <li> It was just ok.</li>
            <li> I would say it it is a problem solver for sure</li>
            <li> Best unit yet for my back.</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> It gets to those hard-to-reach places in the midback better than anything else I&#x27;ve used, aside from another pair of hands.</li>
            <li> Love it</li>
            <li> This is the best thing I&#x27;ve found to de-fuzz my back.  </li>
            <li> I think it could be better</li>
            <li> it works ok</li>
            <li> I always have problems with the hair of my back now is al solve with this item awesome!!!!</li>
            <li> It took a while, but I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll get faster with practice -</li>
            <li> Went with top of the line rechargeable this time and glad I did.  </li>
            <li> If you have a hairy back this is the perfect solution.</li>
            <li> ITS OK</li>
            <li> THE HEAD NEEDS TO ANGLE MORE TO ME</li>
            <li> The product works better than I thought, but it takes some practice to get the angle</li>
            <li> I found that advice to be worthwhile.</li>
            <li> It will work much better and you won&#x27;t fumble with the angle of the head of the device so much.&lt;br</li>
            <li> more features.</li>
            <li> …the build quality is way better.  </li>
            <li> The foil head is a nice feature to smooth away any stubble left.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Before purchase I read the reviews and figured that what most were saying was correct.</li>
            <li> Its also better built and quieter.</li>
            <li> Glad I purchased this.</li>
            <li> more power and the added option of the foil head for a closer shave where needed.  </li>
            <li> you cannot see any hair, it is smooth!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I am so happy with this and wish I had received this sooner, it is has made shaving much quicker and gives a better result.  </li>
            <li> This is a must for anyone shaving their back!!ives a better result.  </li>
            <li> This is for body hair that most men shave once a week or once a month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve got back hair, get it, it&#x27;s one of the best purchases I&#x27;ve made this year.</li>
            <li> Love this product....easy to use</li>
            <li> It is better than the hair removal creams.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> at most 5% of hair is caught in the blades.</li>
            <li> I said above, I am still very happy with this purchase...</li>
            <li> the construction quality was just ok.  </li>
            <li> looks like it&#x27;s shaving most of the hair.</li>
            <li> Love this.</li>
            <li> This is 10X better.</li>
            <li> I use it in the shower, the extensions are awesome and work for all areas of your back or wherever &amp;#34;you</li>
            <li> This one feels like it has a much better build quality.  </li>
            <li> so I was able to use it immediately.</li>
            <li> &amp; he&#x27;s pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> best value to get the different heads - both of which I use for mangrooming.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m getting more hair wear</li>
            <li> a blade/razor it a much better option. .</li>
            <li> before the purchase I had my doubts, but thankfully it all turned out even more than expected.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I am much more used to.</li>
            <li> Thought this would be better</li>
            <li> Amazing product, very useful.</li>
            <li> Pros - Works great, easy to maneuver, powerful, heads change easily, locking handle</li>
            <li> /&gt;What&#x27;s more, I was able to do it with no assistance from my wife (you just need a lot of good light and a full length</li>
            <li> This is a really nice step up from the original Mangroomer.</li>
            <li> Nice improvement from the original product.</li>
            <li> Works much better than the original!</li>
            <li> I have the older model of this item that still works great.</li>
            <li> Great product highly recommend</li>
            <li> Blades were very comfortable and the curve of the arm made it easy to stand in the mirror, turn around and reach everything.  </li>
            <li> However, the recipient actually loved it and wanted another one when he broke the first one.</li>
            <li> Even with that said, I feel it provided good results for a first time use.</li>
            <li> The best tool is the double sided fine clipper with the shaver head.</li>
            <li> I was not disappointed!  </li>
            <li> I thought that one was great until getting this new one.</li>
            <li> This is amazing and works great to remove hair on your back.</li>
            <li> Cuts effectively, recharges quickly.</li>
            <li> This tool makes quick work of it in no time the hair is gone at you&#x27;re own leisure.</li>
            <li> and I love how easy it is to change the clippers as well as adjust the trimmer for the desired area of grooming.</li>
            <li> wow lol, you get it :)</li>
            <li> his back is smooth and delicious now!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s mostly a matter about feeling comfortable and confident with one&#x27;s self, and this thing does the trick.</li>
            <li> Best product out there to remove back hair, hands down, it is easy to use, amazing results !!!</li>
            <li> Very good back shaver.</li>
            <li> Very good to shave the back.</li>
            <li> The whole unit is much higher quality construction that i would consider very good (though still plastic).  </li>
            <li> Be sure to press lightly against your back  (as stated in instructions) or it will feel not feel very good.  </li>
            <li> This is without a doubt the easiest and best product to use for shaving your back when you don&#x27;t have a special someone to do it for you.</li>
            <li> I rarely review things but this thing is amazing.  </li>
            <li> Just keep an eye on the double-sided trimmer/foil to be sure the foil is secure.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been working great so far.</li>
            <li> It does what it&#x27;s suppose to do and most importantly saves me the trip and money from going to one of those hair removal and wax treatment places</li>
            <li> Wow it works great and no sasquatch in the neighborhood anymore.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described makes the perfect gift for my 86 year old grandmother.</li>
            <li> First time I&#x27;ve used a product like this and am very satisfied.</li>
            <li> great product so far.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery and good product</li>
            <li> When i bought this shaver I didn&#x27;t expect much even though it received good reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After reading all the negative reviews I was worried that I had not made a good purchase, however this thing works great and is very easy to use.  </li>
            <li> Better than the original but</li>
            <li> I like this one much better than the original Mangroomer</li>
            <li> I was able to shave it all off using this product, and it was quite satisfying to be able to do it alone for the first time.</li>
            <li> Definitely better than the original.</li>
            <li> I gave the BakBlade a try next and absolutely loved it!  </li>
            <li> Much better than the original version.</li>
            <li> Easy to handle.</li>
            <li> I would use a mirror though cause it is easy to miss spots.</li>
            <li> So easy to use.</li>
            <li> So easy to use.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> It takes a few uses to get used to the best way to use it for your body, but once you get it dialed in it works better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> Easy to store and travel with.</li>

            <li> This has honestly helped change my self-image so much for the better.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s great to be able to remove body hair whenever I please and not have to wait until I can get someone to do my back.</li>

            <li> Easy to use.</li>

            <li> Easy to use-- works</li>
            <li> I was looking for more of a personal shaver that also had a great cut.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so easy.</li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, no itchiness afterwards, and it gets so close</li>
            <li> This thing is easy to charge and the angles are easy to adjust.  </li>

            <li> Nothing was easy, nothing worked well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Easy to use and works great.&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li> easy to use and convenient.</li>
            <li> Heads change easily and has a locking switch for removing them.</li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s so easy and adjusts</li>
            <li> Easy to operate.  </li>
            <li> This product is easy to use and removes the hair.  </li>
            <li> So easy to use.</li>
            <li> (haha).&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, this is easy to use and does what it says.  </li>
            <li> I was laughing at how easy it was...</li>
            <li> Easy to use .</li>
            <li> shaver head does not work as good as older model</li>
            <li> I strongly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> After the first couple uses, I had scratches (not the good kind) on my back that honestly kind of hurt.</li>
            <li> Pretty amazing device.</li>
            <li> The battery stayed strong throughout and the reach was fine.  </li>
            <li> MUCH more powerful than the original!</li>
            <li> I have tried everything and this is hands down the best!!</li>
            <li> Just used mangroomer for the first time today, I must say after years of having my girl friend and my son shaving my back, this  item is awesome and easy to use</li>
            <li> The fact that it has a more powerful rechargeable battery is great, and the heads are much more like a traditional trimmer.</li>
            <li> With the extending handle, I was able to do my whole back without engaging the help of my partner, who was also impressed as a result.  </li>
            <li> Great product, exactly as described, make the job a whole lot easier.</li>
            <li> once my brain adjusted it was fine.</li>
            <li> but once I made the adjustment everything was fine.  </li>
            <li> It is easy to use and the cut is smooth.</li>
            <li> and it works just fine.</li>
            <li> and I was able to make quick work of problem areas.  </li>
            <li> Battery charge more than adequate.  </li>
            <li> The hinges feel more solid, the unit is more powerful, and the close shave attachment is very nice.</li>
            <li> You do need to charge the device for 24 hours before your first use, and keep in mind that you need to have a good handheld mirror and a mirror in front of you to do it right.</li>
            <li> My back looks great, device is easy to use.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used the fine trimmer yet, but even the &amp;#34;coarse&amp;#34; trimmer has been great for taking off the bulk of back hair.  </li>
            <li> Luckily the awkwardness goes away as you get more familiar with it.</li>
            <li> However, if you are quite hairy like I am, it will feel like a huge mistake in the 4th hour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li> but this one is a huge improvement.</li>
            <li> the added shaver head is a huge upgrade.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I emailed man groomer and nearly 3 weeks later I have not heard back, man groomer is a great product but what good is a great product when you cannot charge it up and the company refuses to assist you&lt;br</li>
            <li> On that note I will say that I didn&#x27;t notice a huge improvement with the boost, but it didn&#x27;t detract from it either.&lt;br /&gt;-Shaving</li>
            <li> Great back hair shaver!</li>
            <li> Fantastic device.  </li>
            <li> But this shaver works great for the back!</li>
            <li> IT IS A GREAT WAY TO ATTACK, HAIR ON YOUR BACK.</li>
            <li> in all, great product, just hoping the Ultimate Pro doesn&#x27;t die after a year</li>
            <li> I like the rechargeable batteries with charge indicator light</li>
            <li> Fortunately this type of body hair seems to grow slower than scalp hair....</li>
            <li> LOL, or no shirt, at the gym and won&#x27;t have to feel like people might be whispering about back hair</li>
            <li> Great in taking hair of the back.</li>
            <li> Comfortable to use.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Frankly, it got so close as to make me feel smooth as silk.</li>
            <li> Also, if I remember correctly, replacement heads are available.</li>
            <li> so I didn&#x27;t want a cheap flimsy shaver</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is light so you can hold it and maneuver it.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It takes a minute or two to get the hang of it, but once you do it&#x27;s smooth sailing.</li>
            <li> Holds charge well and shaves relatively smooth.</li>
            <li> It works great, only wish Id have made the investment years ago.  </li>
            <li> This one is amazing, no hassle and much time</li>
            <li> Great gift for the man with a hairy back!!!</li>
            <li> Each blade head has a spring joint which enhances flexibility and helps for a comfortable shave.</li>
            <li> The foil head, although not as close as a razor blade, gives a relatively smooth finish.</li>
            <li> Great back shaver.</li>
            <li> , I took a punt on this shaver and really didn&#x27;t expect much to be honest</li>
            <li> The shaves are comfortable.  </li>
            <li> Blade is cheaply made.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately (or fortunately in this case) I dropped it and broke the tab that held the blades in</li>
            <li> Works fantastic.</li>
            <li> no sensitivity, no nothing... except smooth skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This shaver is a great alternative to regular electric clippers.</li>
            <li> overall a great product for men...</li>
            <li> Ever since then, I&#x27;ve been happy with the results of this back shaver.  </li>
            <li> Great tool for shaving the back and neck area.  </li>
            <li> Fabulous.</li>
            <li> Just fabulous.</li>
            <li> Baboon is smooth now.</li>
            <li> Great for shaving back when your alone.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product.</li>
            <li> If you need to take hair off your back and have to do it yourself, this works great.</li>
            <li> The build quality is excellent, the product is well constructed of heavy gauge materials.  </li>
            <li> Charging indicator light shows it as fully charged but the power button does nothing.  </li>
            <li> and it works fantastic.  </li>
            <li> It is AWESOME, and when I had trouble with the clipper and shaver head, I wrote to the company</li>
            <li> This worked great to shave my hairy back</li>
            <li> It will feel and sound like you are breaking it</li>
            <li> Reach is great but requires multiple passes.</li>
            <li> and it is fantastic.  </li>
            <li> This is more useful if someone else is using it on your backside.</li>
            <li> the heck is this?&amp;#34; So I read the fantastic reviews and ordered it.</li>
            <li> Just get it and enjoy the results</li>
            <li> The description makes it sound like it&#x27;s a cakewalk</li>
            <li> Was an excellent device to shave your back hair, I just decided that I really didn,</li>
            <li> I had the Professional model for about 4 years and loved it</li>
            <li> So far so good, lets hope it lasts a while.</li>
            <li> My husband loved his old man groomer</li>
            <li> Had the original and this thing is a far superior product.</li>
            <li> all super..many thanks!!!</li>
            <li> Thanks to the person who invented this,  wish I would have had this item years ago!!!</li>
            <li> thanks Mangroomer!!!</li>
            <li> When this is not an option because you don&#x27;t have the necessary help available, the mangroomer saves the day!!!</li>
            <li> This is a very useful trimmer</li>
            <li> Both heads are very useful.</li>
            <li> Very useful tool well constructed and sturdy.</li>
            <li> Seems very powerful.  </li>
            <li> It has made my grooming quick and easy, and accurate.</li>
            <li> It is quick, easy, and very effective at shaving your back.</li>
            <li> Works as advertised, making it quick and easy to reach those troublesome patches of hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s totally worth the price, just keep it clean and don&#x27;t get the head get corroded!</li>
            <li> At age 40, it seems like the hair from my head is retreating, from their once proud position at the front of my scalp, to an much more defensible position, hidden by my shirt.  </li>
            <li> The single blade cutter gets very close but the best is the foil head with the dual clipping edges.</li>
            <li> Be sure to charge the shaver first before using.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a significant improvement.  </li>
            <li> Finally a back groomer someone can do on their own!  </li>
            <li> so much better than the first generation model .</li>
            <li> I felt like Indiana Jones in the original Raiders of the Lost Ark.  </li>
            <li> This is worth every penny!  </li>
            <li> Had then original.</li>
            <li> Seems to be an improvement over the original.</li>
            <li> Worked okay the first time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really useful and it gets the job done!</li>
            <li> Works great, but needs a little better battery life.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that you can now shave your back on your own.</li>
            <li> /&gt;...now I just have to clean my bathroom...</li>
            <li> t want to be clean shaven after-all and gave it to a friend.</li>
            <li> This thing is a life saver, now I can clean up without having to ask for help.</li>
            <li> This is my third one and is by far the best model I&#x27;ve had.</li>
            <li> This by far is the best to shave your back!</li>
            <li> Extremely useful and easy to use.</li>
            <li> I think so far the best solution is to ask your partner to remove your back hair!!</li>
            <li> Works Great and is worth the money, my husband says he enjoys this a lot better than other shavers he has used!</li>
            <li> It feels kinda cheap at the extension, but other than that its great</li>
            <li> But after I showed her what did it, she now does not refuse to help out specially if I do it myself and I miss a spot or two.</li>
            <li> Best part is I didnt need to ask for help to get any hard to reach places.</li>
            <li> The folding handle is excellent at allowing you to reach those hard to get at areas.  </li>
            <li> It seemed like such a brilliant idea and I had high hopes.</li>
            <li> you are a genetic fur ball but don&#x27;t particularly enjoy the look when wearing a tank top, I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This shaver is well made, it&#x27;s fairly solid and has good adjustments for angles and length.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s way way sturdier, the rubber handle makes it much easier to grip, and it&#x27;s 100 times more stable when having it extended or positioned in any way.</li>
            <li> Shaving is NOT an option unless you are cool with devoting one hour of 5 a day to dealing with stubble.</li>
            <li> Works good but can cause some arm strain when shaving the back.</li>
            <li> My advice would be to skip this and go full on razor adapter like the Razorba or something.</li>
            <li> As someone that has a good amount of back hair this machine is a gift from the gods.</li>
            <li> I love this thing and would highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I liked the old one</li>
            <li> Received it in the mail 2 days, (cool packaging) charged it up overnight and tried it out.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It takes a bit getting used to with adjusting the length and different angles, but all in all a good purchase.</li>
            <li> Thanks to this magic wand</li>
            <li> The adjustable angle &amp; length allow you to keep the blade in full contact with the area being shaved.</li>
            <li> I even laughed at my contortions to try and reach all areas of my back.</li>
            <li> to keep my back in good shape....</li>
            <li> Good product for a last resort.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Downside... it takes a while to get a full charge but the charge lasts a while.</li>
            <li> I use it every full moon</li>
            <li> Good quality and allows you to reach every part of your back with ease.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s still working on that charge 2 months later, so battery life is good.  </li>
            <li> From a disbeliever to a true fan, thank you.</li>
            <li> It is powerful and gets a close and comfortable shave for an electric razor.  </li>
            <li> It feels just as good as scratching your back</li>
            <li> Does have good power and seems like it will last.</li>
            <li> I wish it was designed so it was more flexible instead of straight and rigid.</li>
            <li> and it is good but never gave a close shave and left you with stubble and</li>
            <li> I love it so much</li>
            <li> Not bad product, catches on your hair once in a while</li>
            <li> I imagine I will get better with it as I become more familiar with it (getting used to using the mirror and things being opposite of what you think in the mirror).</li>
            <li> Does exactly as advertised, easy to use and painless.</li>
            <li> Works as i had hoped it would and very easy to ues only have use it 2 times so far so good</li>
            <li> Other than that great product.</li>
            <li> This is a great product, I have had about a week and use it about every other day.</li>
            <li> I finally decided to take the grooming into my own hands and have not been this happy with a purchase in a long time.</li>
            <li> I used this for the first time today and though it shaved the hair off fine</li>
            <li> back, shoulders and arms are nice and smooth every time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice to have smooth back.</li>
            <li> Gets rid of unwanted hair super quick, wish it had an option of removing the extension handle</li>
            <li> They also have this turbo button that kicks the shaver into hi-gear for super hairy patches.  </li>
            <li> Just got my Mangroomer Ultimate Pro Back Shaver today and it works GREAT!!!  </li>
            <li> It arrived quickly and as described no hassles.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Those are the only 2 things I&#x27;ve noticed that aren&#x27;t &#x27;perfect&#x27;, but they definitely shouldn&#x27;t change your mind about getting this item.</li>
            <li> but I made it quick.</li>
            <li> It is the best and final solution to your back</li>
            <li> When I typed in back shaver, many things popped up, many tools the help extended razors, that involved chemical hair removal, and offered counseling for laser removal.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li> The mangroomer ultimate pro back is awesome.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad that I did, this one has a much more solid feel to it,</li>
            <li> I use the head with the foil on it as that seemed to do the best job and left the back</li>
            <li> this model has much more more power and the hinge locks in position (finally!).  </li>
            <li> once you learn the right angles and makes for a clean finish.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the purchase of the Mangroomer for several reasons.</li>
            <li> It was fun cleaning the sink full of hair too.  </li>
            <li> My back is completly smooth, and the device is very easy to operate.  </li>
            <li> But I got the hang of it quickly and now am pleased with the product and the ability to remain clean and hair free back there.</li>
            <li> If you could have seen me try to do it with a standard cheap straight edge razor blade, you would have gotten a good laugh.</li>
            <li> After this I won&#x27;t be able to live without one.</li>
            <li> but the new version is much better.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m really stunned how easy this tool makes it.  </li>
            <li> This works very well and is easy to use.</li>
            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would have to say the overall value of this is pretty good.</li>
            <li> then I would highly recommend this!!!  </li>
            <li> Does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to!</li>
            <li> The Mangroomer works exactly as advertised!</li>
            <li> The first time I has to take a break because of the pain in my neck!</li>
            <li> HIGHLY recommend this product!!!</li>
            <li> I am able to achieve a smooth back but plan on some practice a cool room and plenty of time.</li>
            <li> This works exactly as advertised and was well worth the money!</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s nice to be able to handle something by myself which previously required help from my wife.  </li>
            <li> so you can easily reach any spot on your back, and the trimmer just works magic.</li>
            <li> that are about $10 a bottle and can easily cost more in a short period of time, this is a bargain.</li>
            <li> does a great job with little effort</li>
            <li> so make sure you still have something a little more precise for those spots.</li>
            <li> The package was light (good things are heavy).</li>
            <li> The foil head that comes with this model really helps maintain your work and keep things under control and smooth.</li>
            <li> Nice tool, only they need to work on the heads to make them stronger, sharper, and softer on the skin</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s well worth it.</li>
            <li> well worth the money</li>
            <li> Powerful.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s worth it.  </li>
            <li> The foil shaver does an excellent job cleaning up afterwards and left my back soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s 100% worth it.</li>
            <li> Overall a nice shaver for the money.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth the $59 bucks just for that.</li>
            <li> It is lightweight but powerful.  </li>
            <li> but it really is worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Seemed light and cheap, but far from it.</li>
            <li> I tried waxing it: temporary success.</li>
            <li> Powerful.</li>
            <li> one tiny nitpick is that I might have liked a case/bag for everything.</li>
            <li> I used to either take almost an hour to do this myself or ask my wife to help which she was kind enough to do</li>
            <li> So much better than the old model.</li>
            <li> Really useful product.  </li>
            <li> but well worth it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
            <li> So far I am quite pleased with the results I am receiving.</li>
            <li> so I felt it was worth trying it out</li>
            <li> Worth every penny and saves from costly hair removal treatments.</li>
            <li> (I expect I&#x27;ll use that blade rarely from now on).</li>
            <li> Love the attachment for short hairs that leaves body smooth without any irritation.  </li>
            <li> As long as the battery lasts I will be very satisfied.</li>
            <li> useful for de-hairing the hairy places.</li>
            <li> but they fell short with the swivel head (i.e., the most important part).</li>
            <li> Overall this is one of a kind product that does the job it says on the package and even more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros</li>
            <li> My old Panasonic was better.  </li>
            <li> I had the old one for a few years and it worked perfectly.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s worth getting this device.</li>
            <li> So deffinetly worth the investment</li>
            <li> I gave this a shot, and gave a triumphant grunt after its success.</li>
            <li> The effort required to get used to using it well did not feel worth it.</li>
            <li> can see it being useful with some practice.</li>
            <li> It is not as powerful as I was expecting</li>
            <li> The adjustable handle makes this trimmer very useful and the two heads is nice although I do not see me using the regular trimmer head much since the foil head will be used to keep growth under control.  </li>
            <li> I use the wider but less close shaving head as it is quicker and does a very adequate job and feels very good at the same time.  </li>
            <li> Best of all, unlike other trimmers I have used, it leaves no marks on my back or body.</li>
            <li> Better than the original, but, still nothing close to a regular electric or hand razor.</li>
            <li> I have had other back groomers but this is the best I have ever owned.</li>
            <li> but as I got older more and more hair kept showing up back there.</li>
            <li> I received it today and took it out for a quick test, i know you are suppose to charge it first</li>
            <li> It gives a really close shave (not as close as a razor) with very minimal stubble greatly reducing the shaving frequency.  </li>
            <li> Perhaps for high school or college kids this may work fine for them).</li>
            <li> This model is much improved over the original.  </li>
            <li> This version is much improved and worth every penny!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll tell you right now.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;However, his tools were the right ones for the job</li>
            <li> right then I saw that the shaver hats power in it, I immediately ran into the bathroom, pulled off my shirt, looked into the mirror, and said here we go.</li>
            <li> just right as you reach to do the job.</li>
            <li> I threw mine right in the garbage</li>
            <li> but I think it was the right decision.</li>
            <li> It had a charge right out of the box</li>
            <li> This MANGROOMER arrived and I went right to work...</li>
            <li> Strongly recommended to be a part of your  new life style along with beard trimmer.</li>
            <li> This thing is pretty amazing, and makes keeping brush free as pleasant as it possible can, which is not very pleasant after all.</li>
            <li> Much smoother and more efficient, easier to reach areas on my back, the rechargable feature is huge and the added rubber coatings in places makes it seem much more like a professional tool rather than a toy.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a particularly hairy back, but the ability to clean up the stray hairs is nice.  </li>
            <li> I would much prefer to use this in the shower than have to clean up the bathroom floor</li>
            <li> Very easy to use and the last one I had lasted 6 years.  </li>
            <li> The length of the handle makes it very easy to get all areas of your back.</li>
            <li> won&#x27;t say that it was very easy to do my back</li>
            <li> I actually bought the original man groomer when it first came out many years ago.</li>
            <li> no regrets purchasing this product! :)</li>
            <li> The coarse blade worked fine without any pulling or pinching and the fine shaver cleaned up the remaining stubble well.  </li>
            <li> you can now get a true shave as opposed to just a very close trim&lt;br /&gt;Cons-&lt;br</li>
            <li> Since my screwy hair grows sideways apparently, the &amp;#34;self hug&amp;#34; method seemed most effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Nice, long, adjustable handle.</li>
            <li> It does take a little getting used to the different angles and determining the best arm to use and the right way to use it</li>
            <li> shaver works great all over my body and when my beard gets super chick it chops it right off no problems, I have used it on my upper pubic area directly below my stomach but wont dare to use it on the sensitive parts below that, it is just too powerful and the blade is unguarded</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;clipper&amp;#34; attachment does great, but I am not a fan of the close up shaver part because it seems to pull a little too much rather then trim.</li>
            <li> so I could use it on other areas more easily.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this though and like other comments say, it is light and all plastic; however I feel that if it was heavy it would deter me from using it.</li>
            <li> The new attachment gives the skin a smooth finish.</li>
            <li> On a side note, if this is your first unit there is a learning curve to get the technique right</li>
            <li> it gets a much closer shaver - really close and smooth.</li>
            <li> It worked so well that had I not stopped and spent 10 minutes finishing the job, the hairless stripe diagonally across my back would have looked incredibly silly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Enjoy your smooth back.</li>
            <li> Works great, I can finally shave my back myself.</li>
            <li> It would be great for the initial pass, especially if you look like King Kong.</li>
            <li> I owned the previous version and loved that as well</li>
            <li> It took a few minutes to determine the best angle/hand to use, and I felt like looking back in the mirror</li>
            <li> Overall it works well and is easy to clean.</li>
            <li> This one seems to be more powerful and both heads actually do what they&#x27;re supposed to do.</li>
            <li> Unlike most electric razors, you can&#x27;t remove the top part to clean it out, only the bottom part, which leaves me wondering how long this will work till it clogs</li>
            <li> Okay, after wrestling around with trying to find a true man capable groomer (and wasting a lot of money along the way), this actually delivered on it&#x27;s promise.</li>
            <li> Read all the instructions first, and you, too, will have a smooth back free of hair.</li>
            <li> This is as close as you can get to smooth and hair free without the razor and lastly it charges waaaay faster than the first models.</li>
            <li> Build quality is decent, nothing special as well as the foil shaver head.</li>
            <li> I like it very much.</li>
            <li> I have a huge body hair problem.. shaving my chest is easy, shaving my back not so much..</li>
            <li> So far, it works fine.  </li>
            <li> Once you get used to the angles of the device and how to move not only your arms but even your body, you can come away with a smooth, clean shave.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The unit is super solid and is easy to control.  </li>
            <li> It makes reaching your back super easy.</li>
            <li> Works great for all the hard to reach places.</li>
            <li> This is a great trimmer for the hard to reach places.</li>
            <li> Great product to get to the hard to reach places.</li>
            <li> Works great and has plenty of reach for the hard to get to spots</li>
            <li> Eventually, I figured it out; this thing seems to work best with very little pressure against your skin while using a back and forth motion, like you&#x27;re using a back-scratcher.</li>
            <li> It finally broke after dropping it one too many times.  </li>
            <li> First, the item arrived on time, second, it works very well, and third, I was happy to find out that batteries were not required.</li>
            <li> So, I&#x27;m not a fake reviewer.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll wonder why you waited after the first use.</li>
            <li> eh, mediocre item at best.</li>
            <li> and all it&#x27;s working exactly as I would like it to.</li>
            <li> This worked well on the first try with no missed spots and I would buy it again.  </li>
            <li> It does exactly what it is meant to do with ease.</li>
            <li> Be patient the first time, even a weed wacker gets stuck once and a while.</li>
            <li> at first I was worried I was going to break it.</li>
            <li> The power button is a bit touchy and if you put it in a suitcase chances are that it will start buzzing at the first touch.</li>
            <li> mode with the initial trimmer, getting most of the length gone.  </li>
            <li> The second pass with the alternate shaver head leaves a smooth surface on the skin while catching the stray missed hairs from the first pass.  </li>
            <li> Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> This item was very well made!</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t had my back this smooth since my now ex-wife used to trim it!</li>
            <li> Now I should say that I was one of the first of my friends growing up to get body/facial hair.</li>
            <li> Evidently, gone are the days where guys who shave their bodies are not the norm.</li>
            <li> I feel so much better about myself and cannot wait until the next vacation or pool party</li>
            <li> Ok so I have hair on my back and it has always been something that has not helped with my confidence.</li>
            <li> I used this for the first time today.  </li>
            <li> It took a lot of pressure and many strokes to get the job done on my back.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t pull the hair even on the first use.</li>
            <li> I love not having to Nair my husband&#x27;s back.</li>
            <li> a try the moment it arrived and did not bother to charge it first.  </li>
            <li> I was a bit sceptical at first.</li>
            <li> it does exactly what it says it&#x27;s made for.</li>
            <li> , I was married at one point</li>
            <li> and my wife wasn&#x27;t exactly turned on by it</li>
            <li> The first mangroomer I had stop working.</li>
            <li> Possibly the most valuable invention known to mankind.</li>
            <li> and then I just started using a hair clipper and many different configurations, including duct taping an extension to it, which didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> Not a close shave but pretty close.</li>
            <li> I was able to shave my back in about 5 minutes</li>
            <li> the first use with the attachment for longer hair</li>
            <li> Everyone&#x27;s hair will grow at different rates but I have been pleased with the time it takes before I need to trim again.</li>
            <li> I have yet to charge it again, that&#x27;s using the &amp;#34;boost&amp;#34; feature on my first shave.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend says the Pro model has a better reach and has an extra attachment for a closer shave.</li>
            <li> Love this makes my back feel so much better, don&#x27;t have pulling hair on my back, or my butt.</li>
            <li> I was sceptic all but willing to give it a try.  </li>
            <li> My first go with Mangroomer</li>
            <li> t sstopped working after first use.</li>
            <li> Does not charge after first use.</li>
            <li> and then it&#x27;s out of control and then finally have to ask, and it&#x27;s more embarrassing.</li>
            <li> I cant say its old school razor blade smooth</li>
            <li> and my back has never looked better.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This was the first time I had used a product like this</li>
            <li> It does exactly what it&#x27;s meant for.</li>
            <li> But its still better than trying to do it with regular clippers.</li>
            <li> LOVE THE MANGROOME ULTIMATE!!</li>
            <li> bought their lower end model when it first came out.</li>
            <li> I was able to reach all the contours of my back with ease.  </li>
            <li> Works Exactly as stated.</li>
            <li> Much better than my last Mangroomer.  </li>
            <li> thanks Mangroomer!</li>
            <li> Timely and efficient and exactly what was ordered.</li>
            <li> After some practice I was able to manipulate the shaver to hit all the areas of my back.  </li>
            <li> Overall I&#x27;m pleased with the product performance.</li>
            <li> The power button has a problem ,  the first one would not power off</li>
            <li> My first 30-second impression of using it was one of concern; it didn&#x27;t seem to be taking anything off.</li>
            <li> Once I figured that out, I was able to make fairly short work of things.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I needed.  </li>
            <li> This thing does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do.  </li>
            <li> Does not provide a close shave and need to run over the same area many times to remove all hair even when using the boost feature.</li>
            <li> I had my wife shave it with clippers, but that isn&#x27;t exactly a turn-</li>
            <li> My first lasted several years and many drops.  </li>
            <li> Cuts good head not wide enough for close shave attachment.</li>
            <li> If you like to use a back scratcher you will love this shaver.  </li>
            <li> so that said it gets 5 stars because that&#x27;s exactly what it does.&lt;br</li>
            <li> the extending handle which actually locks into place makes it much better and easier to use.  </li>
            <li> can 10 minutes after using it for the first time.  </li>
            <li> Whomever designed this swivel head with so much tension should be FIRED!  </li>
            <li> I have tried so many body groomers to shave my back</li>
            <li> Love it just bought this item used it on my back removed all the hair with ease.  </li>
            <li> The finer head could stand to be a big wider for greater efficiency but it gets the job done (just takes a bit longer to do it).  </li>
            <li> I had the first edition that used (2x AA batteries).</li>
            <li> I went shirtless at the pool for the first time in 10 years.</li>
            <li> It does exactly what you want it to do and does it painlessly.  </li>
            <li> I have a pretty hairy back and now it is as smooth as a babies butt!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Surprisingly, I didn&#x27;t have to go over the same area more than once or twice.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend is pretty hairy</li>
            <li> Just follow instructions exactly</li>
            <li> AND THE MANGROOMER WILL NOT FAIL YOU.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It takes no time &amp; little effort, very little effort to feel, in the words of the great Zohan, Silky Smooth!!</li>
            <li> The unit&#x27;s head is easy to clean and I can just rinse it under some water in the sink and it folds to a small size that I can easily put in the medicine cabinet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This works better then any buzzer I&#x27;ve used, super easy to reach trouble spots and doesn&#x27;t cut you at all highly recommend</li>
            <li> -- my back is super smooth.</li>
            <li> After a lot of twisting trying to get the angle right, it took about 25 minutes to get the whole thing done.</li>
            <li> and my whole back was smooth and clean</li>
            <li> It takes a little bit to get used to using in on your back but does a very good job.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not super hairy, kinda just right, lmao.</li>
            <li> This is the only thing that I&#x27;ve found that I can use without help to reach my entire back, it&#x27;s fast and easy and a really great product.  </li>
            <li> This is a replacement for a 4 or 5 year old original model.</li>
            <li> As an owner of the original man groomer, I was happily surprised with this one.</li>
            <li> not so with the new heads, and with the foils attachment its quick to touch up.</li>
            <li> This groomer was not cheap by any means but so far it has worked great.</li>
            <li> It cleans up easily, and folds in half for easy storage.</li>
            <li> Cuts clean and does&#x27;nt cut me like the old one.</li>
            <li> It gave my back a lovely trim without too much effort.</li>
            <li> IT IS MADE HEAVY DUTY as I was EXPECTING  something cheap and light weight!</li>
            <li> Only thing needing to know is when you have it unlocked, you have to put a fair amount of pressure to open it up.</li>
            <li> I really like the foil head attachment and use that most often for my back.  </li>
            <li> This Mangroomer shaver is awesome,it trims back hair like a weed eater,it&#x27;s a whole lot better than its predecessor.</li>
            <li> USE A NICE SMOOTH SLOW TOUCH</li>
            <li> They ended up sending a new Mangroomer Ultimate Pro for free since the original was still under warranty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This does everything you want it to do, easily, however it has 2 pretty big flaws.</li>
            <li> All of the positive reviews here were correct.  </li>
            <li> 55 year old Italian man in great shape but too embarassed to take off my shirt in public.</li>
            <li> I have so many gizmos for shaving and trimming that I hesitated for a long time before buying this one</li>
            <li> pretty much does everything it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
            <li> I tried this for the first time, seems to work very well.</li>
            <li> is my first time buying a product that does this haha</li>
            <li> I was able to do my whole back thanks to the way the MANGroomer is designed.</li>
            <li> Well the hardest part of getting a perfectly shaved back in under 10 minutes was getting it out of that ridiculous plastic that everything seems to be packaged in today.</li>
            <li> That gets the fine stubble down to almost smooth skin.</li>
            <li> I have searched high and low and purchased many diff models.</li>
            <li> this is a high quality item that you can use to trim or shave hair on any part of your body, most definitely not just your back.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It trims very close to the skin, but not too close as to cause ingrown hairs and such that I experienced from using other body trimmers like the one Norelco makes.</li>
            <li> They must have put a lot of money into the re-design of the new version and it is well worth it</li>
            <li> Easily shaved my untamed back and front within 15 minutes.</li>
            <li> Easy to reach all areas of the back and to hold.</li>
            <li> Specially back is easily reachable</li>
            <li> I can easily reach every area of my back</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only one I&#x27;ve ever found that&#x27;s fully adjustable and easy to use.</li>
            <li> After years of struggling to reach those points of my back with my own bare hands, and practically dislocating them.</li>
            <li> easy to use and actually removes the hair!!</li>
            <li> I like this shaver make it easy to reach any spot at my back.</li>
            <li> simple easy to use</li>
            <li> It is easy to operate and adjust to different positions.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27; think the head pivots enough to make shaving on a contour easy.</li>
            <li> Although calling the Mangroomer &amp;#34;life-changing&amp;#34; may be a bit of a stretch, it&#x27;s certainly life-enhancing.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I hope this one lasts longer than five years - it certainly looks and feels like it will.</li>
            <li> How smart is that?</li>
            <li> I certainly would recommend it.</li>
            <li> works extremely well and super easy to use</li>
            <li> With hundreds of positive reviews, I don&#x27;t suppose that mine matters a whole lot, but here it is anyway... for the record.</li>
            <li> I was at my point of giving up on this elusive miracle, I saw for the first time with my own eyes the mansgroomer ultimate pro back shaver.</li>
            <li> The new ultimate is a vastly better product.</li>
            <li> I would say fine enough for the perineum but not for the scrotum...</li>
            <li> and then did the fine tuning with the second attachment.</li>
            <li> The teeth are too coarse and it won&#x27;t give you a fine shave.</li>
            <li> so i have some pretty decent growth.  </li>
            <li> As a mixed breed of Native American, Irish, and Italian, I&#x27;m sure my need for purchasing this product can give you a pretty good hint of what hair genes I got out of that mix.</li>
            <li> Easy and quick clean up of light random groups of hair.</li>
            <li> Works pretty good but needs to be charged every other week even though I only use it once a week.</li>
            <li> but with a second hand held mirror and a little time you can get a great result.</li>
            <li> this thing charges fast, cuts hair fast, can reach every part of your body, and did I mention its fast?</li>
            <li> Worked great for a few times but didn&#x27;t turn on after the fourth time using.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s no longer a huge hassle which means I&#x27;m actually doing touch ups each week rather than waiting until it was getting yetti like.  </li>
            <li> Not only did the groomer allow me to get every bit of hair off my back, the additional piece (for close shave) is amazing</li>
            <li> , I really wish they offered replacement parts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It works really well.  </li>
            <li> Now it is gone, thanks to the Mangroomer.</li>
            <li> you have a lot of body hair you have three real options to remove it.</li>
            <li> Any feedback would be appreciated.</li>
            <li> makes fast work of my body hair.  </li>
            <li> My back and balls are smooth.</li>
            <li> I never write reviews but this model really works.  </li>
            <li> Finally, a very workable solution to a problem i have had for years..</li>
            <li> Makes life for hairy dudes that much easier, believe me.</li>
            <li> I really  like this machine i use it twice a week.&lt;br /&gt;You will like as well go get yourself one</li>
            <li> I did not use the foil head yet since the basic head leaves a plenty smooth shave.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen the ones that use a straight razor instead, and that just sounds like a recipe for disaster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;ll be ready for the pool this summer.</li>
            <li> The coarse head to cut longer hairs, then the smooth head to get a closer shave.  </li>
            <li> He had to get used to how much pressure to apply.</li>
            <li> The fit was what you would expect from an OEM product and the quality was totally acceptable.</li>
            <li> and it is light enough to not become tiring.  </li>
            <li> Works very well.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;About 18.5 hours later I got comfortable with the way the unit adjusted/operated and started in.</li>
            <li> Who wants to bother someone with that all of the time?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It was still very close...</li>
            <li> My back is smooth with this device.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Finally, while I just got it and cannot speak to it&#x27;s longevity, I can say that the Mangroomer feels very well made.</li>
            <li> locking it doesn&#x27;t add a whole lot of value.  </li>
            <li> It did not make my back baby smooth but the hair stubble is not visible.  </li>
            <li> It is only visible in light with someone looking close for it.  </li>
            <li> They really need to fix the quality and the design flaws of this unit.  </li>
            <li> then they don&#x27;t really care&lt;br</li>
            <li> Better than expected product.</li>
            <li> This is a well-made tool that accomplishes its purpose very well.</li>
            <li> very well.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> I looked it over, then plugged in the charger to get it ready for the morning, thinking</li>
            <li> I needed you so much</li>
            <li> Works really well -close shave .</li>
            <li> both cut very well as per my expectations.</li>
            <li> The product works very well and would recommend to anyone.  </li>
            <li> and I am a very hairy dude.</li>
            <li> Works very well.</li>
            <li> My skin is left smooth and hairless after using the shaver.</li>
            <li> thanks</li>
            <li> a completely straight position.&lt;br /&gt;-The</li>
            <li> Thanks for this product.</li>
            <li> Product feels durable without weighing too much.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t cut me up, got a very close shave, and</li>
            <li> I can easily keep my back, my ears, and the back of my neck clean shaven.</li>
            <li> I dont really care for some rechargeable things like this</li>
            <li> I was suprice frim the quality and the fast shipment.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Just as much as my chest.</li>
            <li> This really does work quite well.  </li>
            <li> I have used this a couple times now and really like it.</li>
            <li> The shave is very close, which was one of my concerns.  </li>
            <li> This product works very well.</li>
            <li> it shaves very close, so it works, 3.</li>
            <li> Saves so much time and embarrassment.</li>
            <li> Well, I can&#x27;t really use it.</li>
            <li> Razor works very well and reaches all problem spots.</li>
            <li> I primarily use the latter now on a weekly basis.  </li>
            <li> Is fast, efficient and gets the job done.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very dissapointed with this model .</li>
            <li> Felt like a gentle massage.&lt;br</li>
            <li> ; head works really well at trimming it like it was done with a blade.  </li>
            <li> Seems very sturdy and well made</li>
            <li> thanks.</li>
            <li> Works better than I expected.</li>
            <li> Works really well.  </li>
            <li> make Magnum PI look like a hairless wonder and the Mangroomer really does the job.  </li>
            <li> Of course, I didn&#x27;t really give it a chance because it just felt awkward.&lt;br /&gt;Decided to give this version a try and</li>
            <li> It takes some practice to reach everywhere, but with the foil shaving head, the shave is very close.  </li>
            <li> I used to use liquid creme hair remover and that was smelly, a real pain and time consuming.  </li>
            <li> Thanks mandog groomer.</li>
            <li> Does the job and is very efficient.</li>
            <li> Very well built.</li>
            <li> Thanks once again Amazon for prompt delivery to Australia.</li>
            <li> My husband really likes it.</li>
            <li> It gives a very close shave.</li>
            <li> It is much faster and easier to have a girlfriend or whoever you can talk into using a Philips Norelco Bodygroom to do it for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> its very sturdy&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> Thanks to this, atleast I can walk out the door without bringing a sweater with me.</li>
            <li> Thanks You.</li>
            <li> It is very well designed.</li>
            <li> but he really loves this one.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I give this a REAL five star rating.&lt;br /&gt;Buy</li>
            <li> No one really dreads shaving their face</li>
            <li> Skin irritation at first is normal.</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t want a unit with a rechargeable battery, but after using the unit a couple of times, I&#x27;m thankful for the rechargeable battery and the increased energy as compared to the disposable-batteries.</li>
            <li> Really like this thing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very durable and gets the job done with a minimum of fuss.</li>
            <li> Product worked better than I expected.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I have been experiencing the age old problem of hair migrating from the top of my head to my back.</li>
            <li> Being cordless means it&#x27;s very easy to maneuver and use without tripping over the cord or dragging half of your bathroom counter contents onto the floor.</li>
            <li> I have had the original Mangroomer for several years, overall it worked fine.</li>
            <li> From back to front, top to bottom and left to right.  </li>
            <li> , I like the shock absorber flex heads, and the angles/extensions make it easy to get the normally unreachable parts of the back.</li>
            <li> The long and flexible handle makes it easy to reach every spot on my body.</li>
            <li> Strong, reliable, long battery life.</li>
            <li> The new super duper model makes the old model look like a preproduction prototype.</li>
            <li> Other than that the shaver is okay.</li>
            <li> One of the other concerns I had was whether or not I&#x27;d be able to use this everywhere</li>
            <li> There are other methods out there for one to consider as I did, but I could not be more happier with the Mangroomer.</li>
            <li> It was originally given as a gag gift several years ago.  </li>
            <li> I had the original one that was battery operated and finally died.  </li>
            <li> I like it better than the other attachment.  </li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;extra head&amp;#34;, which is a foil with regular cutter blades on either side is probably more comfortable than the standard cutter head for most guys, though it is not as wide as the regular cutter, it does cut quite closely.  </li>
            <li> WOW, I am an engineer and this unit is full professional quality..</li>
            <li> Most importantly, it&#x27;s easy to reach any of those places that are normally tough to get to.  </li>
            <li> My husband was able to shave his own back and only missed a few spots.</li>
            <li> I am a women who is young and suffers from back problems with a huge surgery that prevents me from bending, this is awesome for shaving my legs that I can not reach or see to shave.</li>
            <li> /&gt;To be quite honest, I can not tell a single difference using it between the 2 different versions.</li>
            <li> Only operates for a minute or two before it dies, even after full charge.  </li>
            <li> Its pretty loud.</li>
            <li> But WOW - this thing really works!  </li>
            <li> 15 minutes ago, I had a back full of hair.</li>
            <li> Finally, a TRUE back shaver!</li>
            <li> Even if you don&#x27;t have a flexible upper body, you should be able to get every spot on your back with absolute ease.</li>
            <li> The first purchase was made with the old model that broke after 1 year of use.  </li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t start using the replacement back shaver until November of 2015 and the double-sided trimmer/foil just recently started to not trim back hair near as good as it first did.</li>
            <li> Not sure why I had to start growing back hair in my late thirties, but am glad to be able to get rid of it now on my own.</li>
            <li> You could feel the stubble if you ran a hand across my back, but really not bad at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The dual clippers are fine enough for some sensitive areas.</li>
            <li> It mowed the stuff down like a weedeater through peachfuzz and my hair is more like that found in a horse hair blanket than flowing silken</li>
            <li> I love it and would recommend this to other guys who need to trim up!</li>
            <li> so I can show-off my new self!</li>
            <li> Charge last more than long enough and the device gets me smooth, no stubbles.</li>
            <li> This ultimate pro is worth the extra $ for the improvements and bells and whistles but the original model will get the job done.</li>
            <li> The new foil head attachment and the flexibility in both heads really help it give you a closer shave.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re not careful, you can scrape yourself a bit, but you just need to keep it at the right angles.</li>
            <li> I felt so bad I upgraded him to the Mangroomer Pro which he loved so much more.</li>
            <li> /&gt;that was fine the first ten years of our marriage, but the last 5 years or so</li>
            <li> No pull, love that I can use this dry and in wet conditions and have the same smooth results!  </li>
            <li> There is a slight pinching feeling but be a man about it and use this product such a smooth easy to use product.</li>
            <li> To be clear it won&#x27;t leave your back razor smooth, but nobody will be tossing you a banana at the pool.</li>
            <li> But it does feel sturdy and has a decent reach.  </li>
            <li> Like this one much better because a) rechargeable battery, b) alternate foil head c) even foil head has traditional blade feature happening</li>
            <li> It broke, which is why I opted to purchase the Super Mega Ultimate Hairy Man</li>
            <li> I decided to go with the ultimate version - (only 10 bucks more).  </li>
            <li> I am a hairy guy on my back and shoulders and this product makes quick work of that.  </li>
            <li> At the purchase price it was a real steal, actually if it was to ever break then I would still re purchase another item even if the price was at $200.00 the product was definitely worth every cent</li>
            <li> Better than last one I bought, wish it had battery back up</li>
            <li> It makes quick work of that Sasquatch hair on your back and chest and anywhere else you wish to use it.  </li>
            <li> It also has cutters on each side which are supposed to catch stray hairs missed by the main cutter.</li>
            <li> My hair is thick and coarse and the trimmer cut through it great.</li>
            <li> Works decent but don&#x27;t expect a miracle.</li>
            <li> It works far better than I expected.</li>
            <li> I used it once, and now the main head no longer works.</li>
            <li> Super flexible shaver that can get just about anywhere on your back.</li>
            <li> each version is better than the last, and the trend continues with the Ultimate Pro.  </li>
            <li> The older I have been getting</li>
            <li> , I have only used the trimmer not the other attachment, but as a life long back shaver I am very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> however, the first pass cuts it down almost smooth.</li>
            <li> I got it as a Christmas gift for my husband with high hopes of not needing to assist him with his man grooming any longer.</li>

            <li> I highly recommend this for any guy needing to groom hair off any part of their body.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend mangroomer</li>
            <li> I would highly suggest to any one not to purchase this product.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommends this product</li>
            <li> Highly recmmend for hairy guys like myself.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> First product I&#x27;ve found where I can reach every part of my back without irritating my skin and the build quality is pretty good.</li>
            <li> The handle extends to allow you to reach the lower back and the clippers are very sharp and do a great job of trimming the back hair.</li>
            <li> I was able to do my back and front in 5 minutes flat.</li>
            <li> The size of this shaver makes it easy for even the least agile person to reach every area of the back.</li>
            <li> I am super pleased that I did as in only a few minutes</li>
            <li> This seems to be a considerable improvement over the original in terms of overall quality of design, functionality, and quality.  </li>
            <li> It costs a little more but man</li>
            <li> You cut through my back hair like a hot knife through butter!  </li>
            <li> Just used my Mangroomer Ultimate Pro for the first time!  </li>
            <li> I think they could have done this a little better.</li>
            <li> This time I bought the upgrade and WOW!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok, still having trouble making sure the razor head is FLAT on my back.</li>
            <li> I have used other shavers but nothing as easy to use as this.  </li>
            <li> on time kind of hard to use</li>
            <li> The grip has a nice extension so you can virtually get any hard to reach part of your body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Everyman should own one that has hard to reach hair for removal.  </li>
            <li> This is all or nothing.&lt;br /&gt;Shaving the back was tricky too, while back there, I thought I&#x27;d clean up the rear and ouch!  </li>
            <li> It is not a clumsy plastic like other trimmers and it is easy to use.</li>
            <li> Quick and very little clean up...</li>
            <li> Maybe people with real sensitive skin could have a problem.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and working without problems so far.</li>
            <li> , I can get a smooth stroke all over those rough terrains.  </li>
            <li> The trimmer works great but the foil head is useless.  </li>
            <li> I am a pretty frugal person, and I have no regrets whatsoever about this purchase.</li>
            <li> Having a hairy back poses self-confidence issues when trying to date, and its always on a mans mind the first time he gets intimate with a lady.</li>
            <li> keeps a charge long and lasts thru a full haircut.</li>
            <li> Just used it the second time today and well worth the money.</li>
            <li> I figured it was just normal chaffing.</li>
            <li> Based on another review I saw it doesn&#x27;t seem worth my time to contact anyone because they only can help if you&#x27;re buying something</li>
            <li> This thing is well-built and goes a long ways on a full charge.</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s powerful enough to handle the job!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just a normal guy that hates to look like a rug.  </li>
            <li> Worth paying extra for the &amp;#34;Pro&amp;#34; with the pivot head.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good product but not Great.  </li>
            <li> Works good but not great.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s heavy duty and cleaning the groomer is fast and easy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using regular beard clippers to get my back hair for some time, and it isn&#x27;t easy, and you don&#x27;t get all of the hair.  </li>
            <li> There are not enough positive  comments I can say about this device!</li>
            <li> Surprisingly good product that does exactly what it says with little fuss or trouble.</li>
            <li> results though were outstanding, absolutely no cuts, red lines and more importantly, no rash.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve yet to use the smaller head because the bigger one seems to work fine.</li>
            <li> Overall, I would recommend purchasing this if it&#x27;s your first Mangroomer or upgrading if you have older models.</li>
            <li> but I just got this new one</li>
            <li> There are two models of the new one...</li>
            <li> so I had to purchase a new one.</li>
            <li> and I have to buy a new head for it.</li>
            <li> I bought this one because of the new close shave head</li>
            <li> I broke it a couple of weeks ago and decided to order a new one.</li>
            <li> would have probably given it 4 stars because I expected it to be a bit more solid...</li>
            <li> This shaver works ok to shave your back, but it will cut you up if you aren&#x27;t careful.</li>
            <li> It left some red marks (light scratches) that disappeared in an hour or so.  </li>
            <li> One note is that it is very loud.</li>
            <li> have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Very surprised at how well this works.</li>
            <li> GREAT FOR OTHER HARD TO REACH AREAS</li>
            <li> /&gt;Two weeks passed and they never responded to my first email, I sent a 2nd email and still no response.</li>
            <li> Larger and much more power and the other head allows for a finer trim.</li>
            <li> Wow!  </li>
            <li> After the first initial charge, I have used the item for quite a while with out it loosing any power.</li>
            <li> I have to add that the first time he used it he did have a couple red marks that stung for a couple days</li>
            <li> I just used my shaver for the first time last night</li>
            <li> But just the same, it worked pretty well.</li>
            <li> The only thing that could possibly make this product ANY better, is another pair of eyes in the back of my head !!</li>
            <li> my man groomer finally died and I went to charge it for the first time, to my surprise</li>
            <li> it blows my old one away!</li>
            <li> The  push button to lock the angle is hardly necessary and you could damage the ratcheting joint if you try to adjust the angle without unlocking it first.</li>
            <li> All I can say about this shaver is Wow!</li>
            <li> I needed the &amp;#34;Power Burst&amp;#34; feature only during the first shave.</li>
            <li> I generally just use the trimmer and not the shaver, so this is really a review of the trimmer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried everything from waxing to Nair for Men to trying to just embrace the fact that I&#x27;m a furry dude and letting it go but the only thing that has consistently worked for me is the Mangroomer.  </li>
            <li> I got this as a Christmas present and after the first use I am amazed.  </li>
            <li> The flat thin head works great for me.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This was the first back hair trimmer/remover I&#x27;ve ever tried, so I have nothing to compare to the Mangroomer.</li>
            <li> Actually works pretty well.</li>
            <li> No complaints so far!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my son with a pretty furry back.</li>
            <li> WOW!  </li>
            <li> Better than other shavers from the big names which I have tried.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use and requires little effort when shaving.</li>
            <li> A little scratched up, so go easy with it when in use.</li>
            <li> As long as I keep up with it, I probably will only need to use the close shave (ie fine tune)&lt;br</li>
            <li> 4 minutes ago I was sitting down at my computer, HAIR FREE, to write this review.</li>
            <li> If you got a hairy back like I do than this is exactly what you need, I always had a hard time shaving my back with those small shavers and always needed help, but with this baby it doesnt take more than 5 minutes and the battery lasts a long time, and the best thing about it is that it reaches every single tricky spot.</li>
            <li> Technology has made it easy for the single man to manscape his back.  </li>
            <li> Easy to reach every single contour of the back!</li>
            <li> They fixed it in the new one</li>
            <li> My back hasn&#x27;t looked this hairless or felt this smooth in a really long time.</li>
            <li> wide head makes it a quick job and the handle expands to any length</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was able to do my entire body without recharging and the motor didn&#x27;t seem to be slowing down.</li>
            <li> It does exactly as indicated, reaches all the hard to reach areas on the back to remove that unsightly hair. :)</li>
            <li> It is quick and simple to use and keeps unwanted back and shoulder hair almost invisible.</li>
            <li> However, subsequent shaves are quick enough that it hasn&#x27;t been an issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It makes nicely just a little red marks for few minutes from the metal edge they go away quickly</li>
            <li> Judging by the poor reviews the previous Mangroomers received, this one must be greatly improved because I really like it.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this cuts my skin more easily than an adapter for a regular razor, and doesn&#x27;t shave as close.</li>
            <li> This is not my first Mangroomer, I had the original silver AA battery version for at least 5 years</li>
            <li> Full price is less than a one-time waxing where I live</li>
            <li> Surprisingly, no nicks and cuts but a clean, smooth back...</li>
            <li> It left a little more on my chest than everywhere else</li>
            <li> Works fine, a bit stiff when adjusting but otherwise does the job</li>
            <li> had a problem with my unit: the charging light did not turn green when the charge was complete.</li>
            <li> This is a great groomer for difficult zones like the back.</li>
            <li> clearly states</li>
            <li> , I guess they no longer check emails.that was a complete joke.</li>
            <li> No problems in 6 months of use so far.</li>
            <li> Well maybe I&#x27;m sensitive.</li>
            <li> Reaches just where I can&#x27;t to complete my manscaping process.</li>
            <li> So of course I needed to use his old electric razor to finish the job.</li>
            <li> Cons - None so far.</li>
            <li> Wow</li>
            <li> and I receommend to any dude who hates their back and wants it removed effortlessly.</li>
            <li> Use it frequently.</li>
            <li> Very helpful if you don&#x27;t have someone to help you shave your back.</li>
            <li> This thing made it trivial to make it completely disappear.  </li>
            <li> Holds a charge forever and as long as your consistent</li>
            <li> One of the issues I faced is that there really wasn&#x27;t a place to &amp;#34;stop shaving&amp;#34; if I had someone shave my back which meant shaving my &amp;#34;front&amp;#34; and arms too.</li>
            <li> Wow.  </li>
            <li> I had the old Mangroomer.</li>
            <li> The bigger head caused way to much scratching of the skin.</li>
            <li> And if you take it on a trip, the button is so sensitive that it will turn on in your luggage and die.  </li>
            <li> I was like wow,</li>
            <li> wow,</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to absolutely anyone who wishes to keep back hair away -</li>
            <li> also customer service is terrific and very responsive.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Let&#x27;s preface this by saying that I have been embarrassed by back hair my whole life.</li>
            <li> and I had so much time left over</li>
            <li> So far I like it... .works</li>
            <li> Used a couple times so far</li>
            <li> This thing can carve through anything and actually gets a very close to the skin shave without having any ingrown hairs at all.  </li>
            <li> I have te old version of this</li>
            <li> /&gt;After the initial overnight charge, I was able to mow my entire back and upper arms with no noticeable loss of power.  </li>
            <li> and I would have to give it a day or so to clear up, so far</li>
            <li> I defintely have some back hair and this really takes care of it.</li>
            <li> WOW.</li>
            <li> I would not consider myself a sensitive skinned person either.</li>
            <li> in all I am very please with this second iteration of the man groomer.</li>
            <li> If you are, like me, a big furry fellow, you really owe it to yourself to try this thing.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Not loud, and it works as described in the companies material.  </li>
            <li> This trimmer had no trouble with it.  </li>
            <li> No problem so far with it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 52 and have struggled with this since it grew in when I was in my early 20&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Charged all night and the light is green</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s ready to go by the next morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> No complaints so far.</li>
            <li> but really ruff on the back.</li>
            <li> far as models go...</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want completely off.</li>
            <li> They say that head swivels, but there&#x27;s so much resistance in the swivel that it might as well just be a solid mount.  </li>
            <li> No complaints so far.</li>
            <li> Having a hairy back is very embaressing.</li>
            <li> Holds a charge very well and is simple to use.  </li>
            <li> for my sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Come on &amp;#34;ManGroomer&amp;#34; NiCad and NiMh are old technology.</li>
            <li> It really does work, it will remove your back hair with no</li>
            <li> Surprisingly near to none irritation on my baby</li>
            <li> Used it one time so far.</li>
            <li> I guess, I&#x27;ll have replace my old Norelco Body Groom with another one.</li>
            <li> I buzz my head and my buzzer isn&#x27;t even as loud as this.</li>
            <li> takes care of that bothersome back hair really well</li>
            <li> this first and save your money in the long run.</li>
            <li> Looks much cleaner than it was though, and I won&#x27;t send it back</li>
            <li> Asking another person to do your back is too much.</li>
            <li> I also applaud the customer service team who sent me another complete product after I had some minor defects with a blade attachment on the first one I received in the mail.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with this brand they are well made ( I&#x27;ve had good luck</li>
            <li> The mangroomer is wonderful for those of us living alone with no significant other to trim those hard to reach hairs off our backs.</li>
            <li> The design makes it great if all you want to do is shave your back, but it&#x27;s way too clumsy for other areas.</li>
            <li> Product performs as expected and advertised except for ability to shave your own back due to angle of head</li>
            <li> My back was silky smooth in less than 20 minutes after getting it out of its package (which itself was no small feat).</li>
            <li> The trimmer has plenty of power for even thick hair, and the included close shaver (foil screen) does a decent job at keeping things smooth.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical before purchasing this razor, but found it to be both effective and of decent quality.</li>
            <li> For the price, I don&#x27;t think it would even be worth messing around with cheaper models or other brands.  </li>
            <li> I know two other men who use this, and we all agree this is very much worth the money.</li>
            <li> I was a little hesitant at first, but after trying it on my shoulder and not having it catch once, I jumped right in and started on my back.  </li>
            <li> and they sent me an ENTIRELY brand new unit!  </li>
            <li> I recently purchase their new Ultimate Pro with Shock Absorbing Head.  </li>
            <li> and I will still need to spend more money on another product that hopefully will work better :(</li>
            <li> Had the standard model and was not happy with it decided to try the pro and was Very pleased with it</li>
            <li> The Mangroomer Ultimate Pro Back Shaver is really a simple and quick way to get the job done.</li>
            <li> It comes with 2 different heads, one for removing longer hair, which you&#x27;ll likely need for the first use, and a closer shaving head for maintenance.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend it to anyone struggling with back hair.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend to anybody with back hair problems</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it if you require any back grooming.</li>
            <li> If you have troublesome back hair, i highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I called the phone number on their website for General Information, that was a complete joke.</li>
            <li> No more waxing and now I feel comfortable wearing singlets/gym tops without the hassle and comments from close friends and work colleagues.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like gentle fingers massaging you all day long.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t believe how much time I have wasted with my regular hair buzzer to clean my back.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ll go back to using a cheap disposable razor and a little flexibility.</li>
            <li> A little awkward but after you get the hang of it you will be happy you can reach spot by yourself!</li>
            <li> How else can one by himself dispose of the hair in those hard to reach places so easily?</li>
            <li> This makes shaving the hard to reach places extrememly easy.  </li>
            <li> It took me at least 45 minutes to get most of what I want, and as of this review I am still not done, I can only imagine how long it would have taken me if I really had a lawn to mow (so to speak)..</li>
            <li> /&gt;I will say that it does take some time to get use to, and you will occasionally drag an edge over your back rather than the full cutting head, but after a while it will become quick and somewhat easy.</li>
            <li> Know this though, it is NOT fine enough for the &amp;#34;sack&amp;#34; or the &amp;#34;taint&amp;#34; but it is fine for the &amp;#34;crack&amp;#34; (and the rest) if you stretch the skin.</li>
            <li> so I went to buy it from amazon and noticed they just release this new version of their back shaver.  </li>
            <li> I emailed them and within 12 hours they had emailed me back and will be sending me a new product.  </li>
            <li> retreating hairs in their new position on my back.  </li>
            <li> not sure why the  Mangroomer website says they have a toll free number for General Information, they have an answering service that tells you to email the company for information.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why the  Mangroomer website says they have a toll free number for General Information, they have an answering service that tells you to email the company for information.</li>
            <li> emailed the company about 2 weeks ago to ask them why they thought the double-sided trimmer/foil isn&#x27;t trimming back hair very well since I have only been using it for 3 months.</li>
            <li> I didnt think it would be such a simple and affective as it really is.</li>
            <li> It really works well and does its purpose, definitely an upgrade from the last model!</li>
            <li> The instruction say that the initial charge should be 16 hours, my green light kicked on after about 3, however I let it go for 16 as instructed.</li>
            <li> My hair is medium/thick and my skin is not especially resistant to cuts, but I really did not notice any scrapes or cuts on my back.</li>
            <li> The only problem I had was I would forget to buy batteries when I needed them, since my old one is 5 years old</li>
            <li> really, you&#x27;ve made the decision to get something like this, spend the extra money and get the Ultimate.</li>
            <li> It would be really time consuming to do the entire back.</li>
            <li> Now, finally, I can shave the hair on my back and feel much cleaner.</li>
            <li> BUT, he attempted using it for the first time the other night</li>
            <li> I used this product for the first time the other day.  </li>
            <li> Major manufacturer flaw causes the heads to break quickly!!&lt;br</li>
            <li> Easy to use, and no more hair on his back.  </li>
            <li> I used to almost dislocate my shoulders trying to use a standard hair trimmer, but now I can easily use a small mirror and stand backwards in front of my bathroom mirror and mow my trap/delt lawn.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It took me less than 20 min to shave my legs and full upper body.</li>
            <li> Takes no more than 10 minutes now including clean up.  </li>
            <li> I usually drop all my shaver product&#x27;s heads in alcohol to clean between usage.  </li>
            <li> It does cover the back area ok, but is not all that easy to keep the clippers angled properly for the hard to reach small area of the back.</li>
            <li> You would require at least 2 passes for a smooth shave.</li>
            <li> Battery has a long enough charge to shave whole body with plenty of power.</li>
            <li> It charges quite fast and the battery last a long time.</li>
            <li> It is very well built, and I think it will last me a long time.</li>
            <li> and my hair is not thick, but gets long after a month of not shaving.  </li>
            <li> The hair on my back is not thick but there is enough there for me to be self contiouse about it.</li>
            <li> This thing barely works.</li>
            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did recruit my adult daughter once, but she only agreed to it after I threatened to ask her Boyfriend to shave me instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So far, I am a big fan</li>
            <li> I use it once a month, just to maintain my bare skin.</li>
            <li> What an improvement, with the old one even after my back got used to the shave</li>
            <li> Such an improvement over early model.</li>
            <li> I was surprised just how big and clunky this thing is.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my early forties now and have been twisting myself into Houdini-esque contortions for the last 20 years in an attempt to keep my back clear of the fur that insists on growing there.</li>
            <li> If you are not careful, you can get scratched.</li>
            <li> The problem is that the trimmer does the same job that the old one does but looks difference and has a flexible head.  </li>
            <li> The first one I got crapped out after only 2 uses, but the replacement has been working very well for the past month, and</li>
            <li> /&gt;The only benefit thing has is the reach action.</li>
            <li> My only problem is how loud the device is.</li>
            <li> I have used it several times so far</li>
            <li> It did feel like it would pinch on sensitive areas of my back by the lats.  </li>
            <li> This product arrived earlier than I expected thanks to Amazon!  </li>
            <li> But I used this on my back and chest and now look like a normal human being.</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s expensive and honestly embarrassing.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Other reviewers got it right about a little bit of learning curve with this.</li>
            <li> THAT MAKES IT EASY TO MANEUVER THE HARD TO GET AREAS OF YOUR BACK.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, you can achieve the same result with a little help from a significant other...or friend who will help you out, if you have a regular electric and/or blade</li>
            <li> Back hair sucks, but this makes it so easy to get rid of.  </li>
            <li> Powerful and cuts well but is dangerous to use in hard-to-reach spots that you can&#x27;t see because it is easy to cut yourself</li>
            <li> They have upgraded it from previous models and it has locking hinges and is now sturdy enough to actually be useful.  </li>
            <li> This is worth the extra money when compared to the previous two mangroomer versions.</li>
            <li> a little long then the single blade head would leave) and left my stomach very smooth.</li>
            <li> Although I have received both electrolysis and laser hair removal in the past, I still have fine, but stubborn hair on my mid to lower back</li>
            <li> The red button on the front of the trimmer intensifies the trim by at least double the power and is great  for thick haired  areas or just generally a quicker trim.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had tried other methods in the past and they do work most times but almost all of them that work require someone else to shave/</li>
            <li> This shaver will not operate while the charger is plugged in (an annoying feature of all shavers of this type) but most people should be able to complete their shave long before the battery runs low.</li>
            <li> Also with the different heads and the REAL locking mechanisms I can use this in any position and not feel it will break loose on me.</li>
            <li> The shaver went smoothly as I went up and down my back sometimes tilting it sideways to grab coarse parts, that night, not a single bit of hair was left across my back.</li>
            <li> the nature of the extension piece makes it awkward to trim your chest or face so you will need a second trimmer if you wish to go full body smooth.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t have a use for the other one.</li>
            <li> so there was enough to hair to present what I would consider full growth on me (not super dense growth but enough to be self-conscious about).  </li>
            <li> Not a single catch, not a single scratch, not a single drop of blood.  </li>
            <li> The only thing holding me back from a 5 star rating is that I owned the Professional version 1 year ago.</li>
            <li> I received my MANGrooomer Ultimate Pro in 2 days (even in the midst of  snow storm) as expected and it was packaged very well.</li>
            <li> On my first shave, I used the wide blade to remove long hair</li>
            <li> This is a good item to purchase it makes shaving that nasty back hair easy</li>
            <li> , it makes a difficult job very easy.  </li>
            <li> but i just purchased my second one after having the first for a year and a half.</li>
            <li> It removed the hair so short you could barely seeit.</li>
            <li> For the first time in my adult life, I have no more unwanted back hair.  </li>
            <li> It trims my difficult to reach back hair nicely with the standard head, and the &amp;#34;shaver&amp;#34</li>
            <li> The motor did bog down some in thicker hair even with the extra power boost but after the first trim regular trimming shouldn&#x27;t be a problem.</li>
            <li> but I had to track down scissors, which is unusual for me.</li>
            <li> I find it a bit difficult to get it flat on my back and end up catching the sides with the cutters rather than the foil itself.</li>
            <li> Gives a high quality body trim without the contortions required from other products.  </li>
            <li> but it is VERY close without the mess.</li>
            <li> It will leave a sharp stubble (normal attachment)&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> /&gt;First off, I may seriously consider scheduling my Back Maintenance days to coincide with my Clean</li>
            <li> My back has been covered in long thick hair since high school (a real BigFoot situation)</li>
            <li> Previously removing unsightly hair from my back has been a long and very frustraiting process...</li>
            <li> primary complaint isn&#x27;t not lithium battery powered so the life of this device may be limited long term.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other razors for back grooming and this one by far exceeds the closeness and ease of use than any of the others.</li>
            <li> Makes quick and painless work of what was once an arduous task.</li>
            <li> This shaver works really well, use to have a female friend shave my back with a t edger (small clipper}  and always had to wait until she had time.</li>
            <li> Since I only use this on my back every month or so, the charge will last for a long time.</li>
            <li> I think the price is a little high for a glorified beard trimmer on a stick.  </li>
            <li> When I am trying to look in the mirror,which is essentially trying to do everything backwards, it is hard enough for me to get my brain to understand going left is really going right, and trying to get the blade to lay flat once you get it to the patch you are looking for is hard.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not sure why it isn&#x27;t trimming back hair very good.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This is long enough to reach all spots on my back!  </li>
            <li> The arm even extends long enough to reach my lower back.</li>
            <li> but it comes in a few patches and as I get older, I&#x27;m 43</li>
            <li> me just say that nothing is more annoying than a company admitting that they are willing to provide you with help if you&#x27;re trying to buy something</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure who sounded the retreat or why, but I&#x27;m fairly certain</li>
            <li> It does take some getting used to especially on those hard to reach areas on your back, but overall very well thought out product</li>
            <li> so far I have only charged it once over night and shows no signs of slowing down.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There&#x27;s no reason to beat around the bush on your back fellas, if its a jungle back there then get this thing already and stop scarring people for crying out loud!</li>
            <li> I would give it a 10 if I could it exactly what it&#x27;s made to do, let just day that I did a lot of research on this product and found some negative comments about it I have to disagree with everyone of them, please follow the instruction in how to charge the equipment and get to work.</li>
            <li> Makes the whole &amp;#34;hard to reach&amp;#34; thing a past problem.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a vanity issue though-I&#x27;m a big guy who sleeps on his back with a ceiling fan wide open.</li>
            <li> The long  arm allows my husband to reach the unreachable section of his back without my help.</li>
            <li> However don&#x27;t expect these to last long.  </li>
            <li> I have not used it long enough to say whether I would purchase it again and  would recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> Extends long enough to reach everywhere, interchangeable heads for clipper and shaver.  </li>
            <li> your back in the mirror takes some getting used to, and you would do yourself a favor if you use a threeway mirror or something that will not require you to look backwards so long.</li>
            <li> I took me a long time to decide how I could remove my back hair.</li>
            <li> The power burst button actually does help power through the long stuff which could be needed so that is a plus.</li>
            <li> The shape is such that shaving the back and sides is relatively easy, but it was a bit more awkward to use on my neck and other parts that aren&#x27;t behind me.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t quite mastered getting every section of my mid to lower back due to a shoulder injury but cleaning up enough to wear tank tops is not problem.  </li>
            <li> My personal advice would be save yourself the few bucks and just get the professional version.</li>
            <li> I tried pressing down too hard, and it bit a little, making me even more nervous.</li>
            <li> Though my first usage was, say, a little rough - slight scratching and red irritated skin, the second time I used</li>
            <li> My husband needs my help as the long handle does not provide enough pressure on his back when he tries to use it himself.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really notice the hinging head and power burst features being that significant, but I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;re bad either.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t imagine being able to use that and not end up with missed patches everywhere; by the time you need that attachment, the hair is short enough that it&#x27;s impossible to see in the mirror.</li>
            <li> bought the Mangroomer Ultimate Pro back shaver on October 25th 2014, the previous Ultimate Pro would no longer hold</li>
            <li> It shaved half my back before running out of juice that left my back resembling that of a zebra.  </li>
            <li> I was just about to order the same model I had due to its years of service until I saw this Ultimate Pro version.</li>
            <li> I have a hand held mirror that I hold in one hand and the trimmer in the other while looking at my back in the big mirror.</li>
            <li> It is a little loud</li>
            <li> This takes a little effort to move and feels like something will break in the process but has been durable so far.</li>
            <li> If you are not sure if you should buy it, I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> The clippers became dull very fast.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t so much getting five stars for rugged heftiness (I&#x27;m still a little biased toward heavy tools) but for function, adaptability, and sheer genius.</li>
            <li> I tested the regular single blade head on a small spot on my arm and it made quick work of the hair as usual.</li>
            <li> Used the first head for long hair and second head to take it closer and finished in 40 minutes-not bad for first time.</li>
            <li> shaver failed after about 1 year of light use.</li>
            <li> Also it does scrape and leave red marks sometimes, but I really expected that.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s because i use it a lot or leave it charging for too long</li>
            <li> but the second closed attachment does nothing.</li>
            <li> I hope it lasts a long time, when you change angle</li>
            <li> Perhaps future versions will allow the trimmer to fold up in the reverse direction so that the shaver head can still be used when the extension is closed</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t take long to get used to the way this works.</li>
            <li> I hope it lasts a long time - I&#x27;ve been using for 4 months or so now without any discernible loss in function.  </li>
            <li> This was long overdue.</li>
            <li> Too long.</li>
            <li> Why did I wait so long to try this??</li>
            <li> The long handle and bent angles</li>
            <li> But that&#x27;s so minor when it works as well as it does.</li>
            <li> now its DEAD plug in charger and light turns green in a few minutes still does not work....</li>
            <li> long.</li>
            <li> Cant speak for long term use</li>
            <li> I am amazed at how long the battery lasts.</li>
            <li> Complete waste of money</li>
            <li> Will leave scratch marks if using the long hair trimmer.</li>
            <li> This was a complete waste of money.  </li>
            <li> I dont know why I waited so long to buy this.  </li>
            <li> And I&#x27;m not far from that.</li>
            <li> Wish I had this a long time ago....</li>
            <li> Stays charged for a long time.</li>
            <li> This does the job magnificently as long as my brain and hands work together to keep everything lined up.</li>
            <li> As advertised - this is a solid tool and is money well spent.  </li>
            <li> Had minor problem and seller replaced the product immediately.</li>
            <li> I can finally reach down my back without the awkwardness of bending my elbow, straining it.</li>
            <li> I mean the fold action is such that it takes quite a lot of pressure to bend it back and forth, so</li>
            <li> Frustrated with my struggles to remove the forest growth, I used this cool new thing called the internet and asked using the keywords: back hair</li>
            <li> After cleaning up my upper back, I extended the handle about half way and locked it into to place with their red locking button and continued to work my way down and around my back.  </li>
            <li> I got the Mangroomer, I was skeptical - ready for another product that didnt live up to its promise.  </li>
            <li> I had the less expensive version of the Mangroomer which did an ok job and lasted for a couple of years.</li>
            <li> The multiple angled handle makes it simple to get at those odd spots that flexibility no longer allows.</li>
            <li> Serious upgrades from the old version at essentially the same price.</li>
            <li> I have used this not just on my back but other areas with no problems.  </li>
            <li> If you want a groomer for your back and other areas (arms, chest, legs etc.)</li>
            <li> I was considering doing the same thing that other&#x27;s had tried, like taping a beard trimmer to a stick.  </li>
            <li> No more taping my beard trimmer to a wooden back scratcher, to reach and shave my back.</li>
            <li> It not only does what the product is intended for, it does it extremely well.  </li>
            <li> It comes with two heads, one is the clipper and the other is similar to an electric razor.  </li>
            <li> I would not buy anything other than the ultimate pro pack.</li>
            <li> Even though every girl I&#x27;ve ever dated has been cool with my meager attempts at managing the back hair situation, I finally decided to take the plunge.</li>
            <li> It might get your back a little red but you will get used to it.</li>
            <li> After using this about every other day (just for my back) with it on the Power Burst it lasted from Christmas to the beginning of February before I had to recharge it.  </li>
            <li> I have tried several other ones (like Phillips) and they just do not work for me.  </li>
            <li> All in all the product does what it&#x27;s designed for and I may venture towards other MANGROOMER products in the future.</li>
            <li> Its better to stay away from it than got your back scratched badly.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The wide blades cover a lot of area and with some practice you will be able to get the job done without twisting yourself in awkward positions.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I started shaving on my upper shoulder blades/upper back and moved over the area a few times.  </li>
            <li> the female connector on the charger pack does not fit inside the male connector on the man groomer....</li>
            <li> /&gt;There&#x27;s no reason to beat around the bush on your back fellas, if its a jungle back there then get this thing already and stop scarring people for crying out loud!er seem to work</li>
            <li> Thousands of dollars wasted, multiple multiple (that was intended) sessions, with the equivalent of going after an overgrown football stadium with a weedwacker, one follicle at a time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have to go over the same area several times to remove the hair and that&#x27;s when it&#x27;s just a few days of growth.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little tougher to use than the trimmer only because of the angle you have to hold the MANGroomer at to get the head to sit flat.</li>
            <li> Both heads get the hair with almost a single pass.</li>
            <li> It takes a bit of maneuvering to use it, so if you have limited mobility this is not for you.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m single</li>
            <li> I used to use a Mach 3 to do the task, but trying to maneuver that tiny handle with reverse motions started becoming impossible.</li>
            <li> Awesome convenient you won&#x27;t be disappointed in the past needed my girlfriend to trim hard to reach areas</li>
            <li> so she usually gets a box of old cereal.</li>
            <li> my biggest concern was that the hinge was too loose...</li>
            <li> attachment heads became loose and fell off while using, and the battery is dead.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li> I wake up in the middle of the night sweating-not any more-first night after using the Mangroomer I had to turn down the ceiling fan.</li>
            <li> back hair has gotten worse the older I get.</li>
            <li> Killed two birds with one stone.&lt;br /&gt;However after you use the main head for the deep jungle you will hardly get to use that head again unless you let the hair grow out again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not super worried about back hair</li>
            <li> Nair: stinky, messy, and not able to cut through the whole forest.</li>
            <li> but how is that any different then previous experience?  </li>
            <li> /&gt;After doing this several times, I was basically told to buy the replacement head on the website for $20 (basically half of what I paid for unit).  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve previously tried shaving my back and chest as well as getting them waxed</li>
            <li> Am I the only one who thinks it&#x27;s odd that there is no case to put it all in?</li>
            <li> Has trouble trimming my thick scruff beard (clippers broke so tried this) seems like it works pretty well.  </li>
            <li> The only reason I am giving this 4 stars and not 5 is because, for me, it was still not very easy to use.</li>
            <li> I find short repetitive strokes help you get a closer shave, it takes less then 8min to do my back and shoulders, I like that it also came with 2 blade options I used the wide groomer blade only 1 time and been using the  foil body groomer bi-directional head every 1-2 weeks.</li>
            <li> Also, the elbow joint is too tight, felt like it would break every time I tried to open it</li>
            <li> In the past other shavers have left a tiny bit of hair that is noticeable when you have black hair and white skin...  </li>
            <li> Little hard to get use to the angle of the handle as it doesn&#x27;t fold out straight.</li>
            <li> so I could use the same device to trim down my chest hair and other parts</li>
            <li> It still scratched my back a little</li>
            <li> Battery life is a little short</li>
            <li> There was a little learning curve to get coordinated, working with a mirror to see my back side.</li>
            <li> Now 6 years later I dropped my shaver by accident and it broke into little pieces.  </li>
            <li> While foil attachment does work and gets rid of stubble, I am not sure its possible to get this effect on your back due to angles unless you are truly a pro, it does work for me on chest and shoulders though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It was on a recent lake trip that I realized I needed to find a product that could help me with this little manscapeing issue.</li>
            <li> It has always been a little embarrassing to always have to ask my girlfriend before going to the lake, beach or  pool to help me groom my back region.</li>
            <li> Little loud but other than that, worked like a charm!!  </li>
            <li> A little rough going over your back.</li>
            <li> but it finally got too dull cut the fur; so I wanted the same brand.</li>
            <li> That said, if you&#x27;ve ever tried to shave your back hair with an electric or manual razor you know just how hard it is to reach all the areas, especially between and under the shoulder blades.</li>
            <li> I found that I didn&#x27;t need to press hard, just make a few passes over the same spot and cover your entire back.  </li>
            <li> So far I don&#x27;t have one thing negative to say.</li>
            <li> The only trouble I had was that because it came from the US the power cable was the US version</li>
            <li> but I have only used it a few times.</li>
            <li> I takes a few minutes to get use to shaving in mirror but no big deal.  </li>
            <li> The handle extends and rotates and locks in a wide variety of positions.</li>
            <li> The only thing that I&#x27;m uncomfortable with is the loud clicking that you have to make when you adjust it open and closed.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband for christmas and after a few others he has used and been dissappointed this one was a TOTAL WINNER !!!!!  </li>
            <li> but I expected that.  </li>
            <li> regrets.  </li>
            <li> Everything I expected.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got to say that it took a few minutes to figure out how to use it properly.  </li>
            <li> I went and showed the partial results to my son and he said, &amp;#34;You&#x27;re gross.&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even have to send back the dead one.  </li>
            <li> Works as expected.  </li>
            <li> and I would have rated it with 5 stars if only the heavy trimmer had a beveled edge so it didn&#x27;t scratch my skin.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had any issues with it kicking my skin as I drag or push it to get the hairs trimmed.</li>
            <li> well spent.  </li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t trim as well as I expected.</li>
            <li> I then decided to give the dual blade/foil head a try on my stomach where I had some short stubble from trimming a few days ago.</li>
            <li> Longer than I&#x27;d expected to reach is no issue.</li>
            <li> waste of money, useless....does not stretch over the ankle, it stays in the ankle just like that product-photo above.</li>
            <li> Minimal abrasion.</li>
            <li> , the equipment does not work and was a waste of $55 for only 4 times being used.&lt;br /&gt;Too</li>
            <li> Definitely have to go over a few times but still beats having somebody do it.</li>
            <li> Not much to say about this..</li>
            <li> not at all what I expected.</li>
            <li> And while my hair wasn&#x27;t the thick, brillo-pad style I&#x27;ve seen on some unfortunate guys out there, it was more than what I ever wanted on my body.</li>
            <li> I have spent a ridiculous amount of time trying to trim the hair in the mid section of my back.</li>
            <li> (Week to week and a half before it is &amp;#34;necessary&amp;#34;)&lt;br /&gt;-Battery lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I charged this bad boy up as required, and had a clean back within 5 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> takes a very long time to get a half done job</li>
            <li> always carefully clean the double-sided trimmer/foil after use to remove any hair, so being dirty isn&#x27;t an issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> After 6 months I have noticed a decided  drop in cutting action which I suppose comes from normal dulling of the blades.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried rigging up an arm to my regular personal grooming shaver with no good results.</li>
            <li> It also takes very little time for him to do his back.</li>
            <li> Easy to use groomer does a thorough job of allowing me to reach and shave that annoying back hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also not sure why they have an email address where customers can supposedly email the company with questions, especially since they do not answer emails..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also not sure why they have an email address where customers can supposedly email the company with questions, especially since they do not answer emails..  </li>
            <li> Seems like it pulls and isn&#x27;t sharp.</li>
            <li> Otherwise you get burn marks from the edge of the sharp edge.</li>
            <li> All my other shavers these days are water proof, which is why I am knocking a star.</li>
            <li> But other than that I have no complaints.&lt;br</li>
            <li> if you don&#x27;t need all of the bells and whistles get the other model...</li>
            <li> No more trying to shave with a razor that is too short!!  </li>
            <li> I am by no means extremely hairy</li>
            <li> I have tried others - even other mangroomer products and non stack up to this one</li>
            <li> The non electric options from other suppliers are just not convenient.  </li>
            <li> I think that is why my other one stoped working.</li>
            <li> No more waiting to have my wife shave my back.</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> I can now go out in public without scaring women and small children.  </li>
            <li> Noisy like any other hair trimmer   Cannot replace battery</li>
            <li> I found no difference in this shaver than any other shaver that I&#x27;ve had.  </li>
            <li> NO THANKS!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m extremely hairy man</li>
            <li> and the screen is lasting longer than any I have had in the past.</li>
            <li> No more patchy spots of hair on my back.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think the second head used to get what&#x27;s left after the initial trim, would work, but I was wrong.</li>
            <li> It is extremely sturdy.  </li>
            <li> but i recommend looking for other options.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Maybe they could put a Dirt Devil attachment in the other end.</li>
            <li> This gets it all and does it quicker and easier than any other shaver.&lt;br</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t work with one hand on the button and the other hand trying to use</li>
            <li> I was only an amateur, but my research showed no license was needed for the \\&quot;Pro\\&quot; model, so</li>
            <li> You can use it in other &amp;#34;hard to reach</li>
            <li> the fluff came off in clouds!</li>
            <li> but after four years of travel out here in the desert and other hostile places it just stopped working.</li>
            <li> Hairy back no more this is a godsend.</li>
            <li> Works extremely well ...</li>
            <li> so I am very careful to get all of them.</li>
            <li> Holy cow.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve had it for less than 12 hours and simply can&#x27;t believe how freaking easy it made this previously annoying and/or somewhat embarrassing task.</li>
            <li> i can finally get my poor sister to stop shaving my back</li>
            <li> This is triple the price but HOLY COW</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little awkward to use at first, trying to figure out how to hold it to reach different areas, but once I did  </li>
            <li> It is long enough to reach all areas although I find it necessary to use my left hand for some areas and that is a little awkward.</li>
            <li> With that said, I was in desperate need of a product that made it easy to manage, or get rid of, unappealing hair on my back.</li>
            <li> Instead, I had been trying to reach around with conventional razors to shave the hair off.  </li>
            <li> It has two attachments a conventional clipper for longer areas and a shorter hair attachment that trims shorter areas.</li>
            <li> If you need to reach those hard to reach places on your back</li>
            <li> I like how it bends and extends to get to the hard to reach spots on my back.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first and it takes a little time, but if you have been searching for convenience and affordable options, this is it</li>
            <li> I love this stupid thing.</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s start by saying the hair on my back has been growing inversely porpotionate to the speed of my metabolism the past few years.</li>
            <li> I have tried to get support response from the manufacturer at least 5 times 3 different ways  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is that I did not purchase this product sooner.</li>
            <li> I only had the cutting head with the cheaper model but this one gives you a second shaving head for extra close hair removal.  </li>
            <li> Because the human-wool on my back was rather thick, I opted for the trimmer blade versus the close-cut/razor blade.</li>
            <li> Also, REMEMBER TO MOVE SLOWLY ACROSS YOUR BACK OR</li>
            <li> Simply start on one side and slowly move across.....</li>
            <li> I bought this to shave my back and shoulders that have thick hair to the point</li>
            <li> Hate that I need it, glad that I have it.</li>
            <li> Maybe that will mow down my jungle like that scene from the movie Predator.</li>
            <li> You cant just plow through or it boggs down.</li>
            <li> If you are one of those guys that likes to take ALL the hair down (arms, legs, ass, etc..)</li>
            <li> If your are down wit dat, just don&#x27;t get bit in the buttocks.</li>
            <li> Works extremely well!</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t have to bother other people (wife) to help!</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve got a hairy back, you know what I mean.</li>
            <li> One of the heads is a little sharp and scratched slightly.</li>
            <li> Blades seems to be very sharp, no pulling.</li>
            <li> Very sharp corners.</li>
            <li> The foil can come loose while shaving and the blades can leave small cuts on your back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> then it&#x27;s predecessor and leaves less scratches&lt;br</li>
            <li> you, like me, owned the previous version and have hesitation about purchasing this one...</li>
            <li> Another half and hour</li>
            <li> It took 5 minutes to do the job, less than an hour to charge, and it feels sturdy.</li>
            <li> I also like how the arm locks at any angle, which the previous models didn&#x27;t and would move during use.</li>
            <li> Owned a previous battery powered model that broke after I dropped it.  </li>
            <li> Not very easy to reach intended spots while keeping the blade at the correct angle.</li>
            <li> But I find it odd that there is no case to keep it in.</li>
            <li> I was finish trimming in less than 5 mins.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my late 50&#x27;s and have back hair that is fluffy..</li>
            <li> Took a little practice but now have it down to a science.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Because there was no good stopping point as I mentioned earlier, I continued to do the rest of my body.</li>
            <li> I have the few hairs sprouting out in random spots on my back and this shaver can get to any spot on your back.</li>
            <li> You will make a mess.</li>
            <li> I tried to pour Boone&#x27;s Farm onto the plastic (it worked for the girlfriend) but it just made a mess.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointed since it&#x27;s pretty much brand-new still.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyways my brothers got tired of shaving my back for me, I would go through painful waxes and my hair would grow back almost as fast as if I had shaved.</li>
            <li> It usually takes me about 20 minutes to shave my back with a razor because of the hard to reach areas.  </li>
            <li> A little cumbersome but works well.  </li>
            <li> Yes, it can scratch a little when you&#x27;re in &amp;#34;weed-whacker&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> It takes a little bit to get used to using it, but it works great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The electric razor does not work well due to the small clipper like ridges on each side of the head.  </li>
            <li> A little bit noisy.</li>
            <li> Does what it needs to do with little effort.</li>
            <li> Could be a little closer in shave.  </li>
            <li> It did irritate my skin and scratch some but no more than any other trimmer.</li>
            <li> ,it&#x27;s a little pricey</li>
            <li> disappointed in what I initially thought was a decent product.</li>
            <li> can be a little painful but worth it.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t shave close awkward to to use handle is just to much can&#x27;t just pull it off</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re unhappy with this, I have to figure you don&#x27;t like much of anything you buy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a few times and it works well going against the &amp;#34;grain&amp;#34; of your hair</li>
            <li> I did experience a few scratches</li>
            <li> heavy duty and the arm locks</li>
            <li> Not cheap at all.</li>
            <li> I think that this will stand up to some heavy use.</li>
            <li> after you bend it as you like it, it won&#x27;t move around when in use, so in my opinion the locking mechanism is unnecessary, so no big deal that my locking button fell</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical at first, but after I used it</li>
            <li> Stop wearing the wool sweater year round.</li>
            <li> Worked as it was intended, the rake took the heavy stuff off and the foil shaver smoothed things out.</li>
            <li> would, and have, recommend this product to anyone that is tired of their back hair.</li>
            <li> Waste of time and money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;ll have a few Easter eggs before I start the diet, ha.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a bit round and had no problem reaching all of my spots.  </li>
            <li> It did take a few minutes of getting used to seeing things in reverse</li>
            <li> do need to go over the area a few times.&lt;br</li>
            <li> In the end it was a waste of money</li>
            <li> Heavy duty body.</li>
            <li> Am I missing something?  </li>
            <li> BUT NEEDS A FEW CHANGES ON THE SHAVER</li>
            <li> Battery died within a few months of purchase.</li>
            <li> It came fully charged, I have already used it a few times and yet to charge it.</li>
            <li> WASTE OF MONEY</li>
            <li> I was very anxious about purchasing this item because the reviews were not very positive.  </li>
            <li> I was done in less than 5 minutes!  </li>
            <li> and you&#x27;re not able to support you with your previous purchase</li>
            <li> The Mangroomer&#x27;s packaging reminded me of my first girlfriend&#x27;s pants, nearly impossible to get into...</li>
            <li> hinge is a bit stiff...</li>
            <li> The extension wand and elbow joint are a bit stiff, but nothing us hairy guys can&#x27;t manage.</li>
            <li> how stiff the folding mechanism is (yes it is unlocked).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit annoying to clean the blades though.  </li>
            <li> like the long arm, but the clippers, even on the heavy setting are not great.</li>
            <li> The main cutting blade does get caught up sometimes</li>
            <li> .. not easy to use..</li>
            <li> At first I was a little disappointed since I had some trouble &amp;#34;mastering&amp;#34</li>
            <li> The problem with this one is that once the head opens and the spring pops out it is almost impossible to get back into place without breaking the tiny plastic lip that holds the spring.  </li>
            <li> The thin head solves that problem but it does leave scratches if your not super careful.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not talking Wookie proportions, but still pretty bad.</li>
            <li> The \\&quot;teeth\\&quot; on the clippers are really small and - believe it or not - utterly comfortable gliding over the skin.</li>
            <li> I just finished in 5 minutes what would have normally taken half an hour of awkward positions and objects taped to my electric shaver just to get to hard to reach places.</li>
            <li> Manageable for people who have tight shoulders and not able to reach difficult spots on back.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is actually so powerful that it can actually give you some nasty nicks if you have fat rolls</li>
            <li> I would like my money back since its mere waste of time and money.</li>
            <li> Takes a little time to get used to it but what a life saver!</li>
            <li> If you have thick hair you have to take little bits at a time.</li>
            <li> If you shave your chest or back, you can&#x27;t go wrong buying this thing.</li>
            <li> I have had several others and they were uncomfortable, pinched and yanked at the hair.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Otherwise, the product works as advertised if not better.  </li>
            <li> Well done to the team at Man groomer functionality, craftsmanship and dignity all in a small package that&#x27;s cheaper than a box of cans.</li>
            <li> and I am past the return period</li>
            <li> The problem is that once the heads that attach to this unit open they are basically useless.  </li>
            <li> Too heavy, too noisy!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been uncomfortable about my back hair.  </li>
            <li> I usually do my research and make informed decisions.  </li>
            <li> That was a weird experience as he did back, sack and crack...</li>
            <li> The Phone support number connects you to people who sell but they are not able to answer tech questions or escalate.  </li>
            <li> I just received the product, its battery is dead and the power supply fo the battery charger included has a UK socket!</li>
            <li> This product works as advertised for removing body hair, although it does leave small amount of invisible stubble that you can feel.  </li>
            <li> In the past I have had it waxed and that hurts like hell.</li>
            <li> Somewhat difficult to use stretching to the lower back.</li>
            <li> next day, I grabbed the Mangroomer Ultimate Pro, and declared war on those chicken-@#$!</li>
            <li> No more appts for waxing.  </li>
            <li> The batteries seem to have at least a few hours of life in them before they need recharging as well.</li>
            <li> In addition, the groomer itself feels sturdier than past models.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s bulky, heavy and clumsy to handle.  </li>
            <li> No more man sweaters in the summer.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not Ape hairy, but it is a little depressing watching the hair on my back increase as the hair on my head decreases, so I thought I would give this a go.  </li>
            <li> Its big, heavy, and awkward.</li>
            <li> Not real happy with it.</li>
            <li> - doesn&#x27;t scratch, opening is very stiff but has not broke</li>
            <li> Its still a little awkward to reach everywhere even with the long bent handle.</li>
            <li> Not only did that hurt, but it was expensive, inconvenient, and caused a rash and irritation that lasted a long time.</li>
            <li> but if you have a hard time going in that direction it does not cut well.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve got hair in hard to reach places, then this is a lifesaver.  </li>
            <li> The blades seem to be dull</li>
            <li> hard to use don&#x27;t remove lots of  hair</li>
            <li> Reach the hard spots with this gem.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s just too hard to maneuver.</li>
            <li> Pressed too hard in thick fur.)</li>
            <li> Mangroomer, I should have bought you sooner, but I let negative reviews cause me to doubt you.  </li>
            <li> well, at least I don&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use it at least once a week and have not had to replace blades yet.  </li>
            <li> If this product lasts at least 6 months without dying, I&#x27;ll be changing my review to 5 stars.  </li>
            <li> can&#x27;t think of anything negative to say about the Mangroomer.</li>
            <li> It glides across your back cutting the hair away with no pulling or scratching.</li>
            <li> The battery loses charge in like 2 days and since its USB chargeable every time you want to shave, you have to plug into a USB charger for an hour.</li>
            <li> At least its batteries hold charge and you can replace them.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t believe the negative reviews.  </li>
            <li> This will save me at least $400 in one year.</li>
            <li> I then used it in less dramatic areas.</li>
            <li> Im talking thick hair too.</li>
            <li> Just move slowly and deliberately</li>
            <li> The instructions say to make slow passes to prevent pulling the hair out.</li>
            <li> and Its thick too.</li>
            <li> You have to draw it slowly across your skin or it will pull the hair.</li>
            <li> Have used Mangroomer&#x27;s entry level unit (battery operated) for a few years but build quality of the hinge was poor and eventually lost it&#x27;s ability to lock in place.  </li>
            <li> i have lots of hair that is thick and in about 10 minutes  </li>
            <li> No more!</li>
            <li> The locking mechanism at the pivot point seems to be pointless, because when it is locked or unlocked it is very hard to move.</li>
            <li> The perforated protective cover on the cutting head ripped in the first week, which causes the hair to get caught between the cutting wheel and the cover and pinches a lot.</li>
            <li> Bought this after I dropped the older version on my marble bathroom floor and cracked the base.</li>
            <li> About a half hour after using the thr base trimmer head I started to feel a pain irritation on my back.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nearly impossible to keep the cutting head flat against your back!  </li>
            <li> Cuts terribly, must go over regular arm hair multiple times.</li>
            <li> The clicking and slight resistance encountered while adjusting the handle&#x27;s angle and length is a bit scary but all works well.  </li>
            <li> I have had 2 of the previous models and the inaccessible batteries failed to hold a charge after a year.  </li>
            <li> I just wish it were less expensive.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little difficult to get to some areas without scratching yourself.</li>
            <li> but it does leave a little bit of fuzz which the foil head was useless for removing.</li>
            <li> The groomer is going to scratch your back painfully</li>
            <li> The rash that followed was just too sore and painful to try and keep the forest on my chest and back</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not good with mirror contortions.</li>
            <li> Also, the handle isn&#x27;t detachable, so it&#x27;s awkward to use when shaving any other parts of your body, which means you have to buy another shaver to do the job.</li>
            <li> So I make a couple of slow passes on my upper back/shoulder area and ... holy crap ...</li>
            <li> long, curly black hair that I hated within minutes.</li>
            <li> have bad back hair, its really embarrassing, there&#x27;s nothing worst than spending the night with a chick</li>
            <li> weak skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought this knowing I would give it a tough workout.  </li>
            <li> however, very stiff hinge on this product that is difficult to move.</li>
            <li> I sense she&#x27;s gotten a bit tired of</li>
            <li> , I was a bit skeptical after seeing some of the negative reviews.</li>
            <li> I work out a lot and hate back hair.</li>
            <li> and she finds out you&#x27;re secretly the Wolfman</li>
            <li> The second attachment is worthless.</li>
            <li> In any event, I&#x27;ve tired everything over the years...</li>
            <li> I got so tired and grossed out when my hubs would ask me to help him shave or Nair</li>
            <li> But, could be worse.  </li>
            <li> I am one of the unfortunate men who grows thick body hair like Chewbacca.  </li>
            <li> , I tried running a razor over my back every other day (painful, stings, cuts and threw out my shoulder trying to reach), I tried electric razors (no reach and burned the crap out of my skin)...</li>
            <li> Seriously!?  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want to do waxing anymore as it is expensive, long and painful.</li>
            <li> No more stretching and maneuvering into awkward positions trying to trim.</li>
            <li> bad you can&#x27;t leave less than one star rating.</li>
            <li> Much less painful than waxing and pays for itself in just 1 use compared to waxing.</li>
            <li> but the hinge was loose and would not hold angle, which was quote annoying.</li>
            <li> I was admittedly a little disappointed.  </li>
            <li> It is very hard to work with!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not at a point where I could take off my shirt and just throw on a mask to be a werewolf at Halloween, but it was getting weird.</li>
            <li> That would be uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> Sorry I didn&#x27;t purchase this item sooner.</li>
            <li> that were *extremely* difficult to hold onto and get to hard-to-reach areas.</li>
            <li> I had looked at something like this before, but was skeptical.</li>
            <li> Its been in a drawer, useless, every since.</li>
            <li> It was a tedious chore.</li>
            <li> I was originally skeptical about the battery, but it has proven to hold a charge for quite a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is bulky and difficult to handle.  </li>
            <li> The head is at the wrong angle to work well.</li>
            <li> got jealous and angry.</li>
            <li> It renders the device useless.</li>
            <li> Useless.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about buying</li>
            <li> Its not perfect, but there is nothing that even comes close to this out there for now.</li>
            <li> I promise you will not be sorry.</li>
            <li> Too difficult to use.</li>
            <li> I absolutely hate back hair, but I equally hate asking my wife to help me with it, just so embarrassing.</li>
            <li> Had horrible experiences with waxing, and other alternative was to find someone else to shave it.</li>
            <li> This crazy device was just what the doctor ordered.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t have to awkwardly ask my roommates to help me shave anymore</li>
            <li> Yes it is awkward.</li>
            <li> The cutting heads both function</li>
            <li> The package it came in required a cutting torch to get through it-</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve not had any problems with scratching or cutting from either blade.</li>
            <li> After that, it started and has been pulling my hair, and barely cutting.</li>
            <li> Sadly it doesn&#x27;t seem to have ever stopped!</li>
            <li> Very difficult to use on chest or front of body.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;ve always been very uncomfortable with my appearance.</li>
            <li> i was very skeptical until a friend told me about it.</li>
            <li> but It wasn&#x27;t very difficult either.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Wax ( I&#x27;ve got nothing bad to say about waxing</li>
            <li> I wanted to give this bad boy</li>
            <li> well, not that bad,</li>
            <li> got off to a bad start when it broke, but they replaced it as soon as they found out</li>
            <li> and it cuts badly.</li>
            <li> Seriously shocked how well this thing works.</li>
            <li> and it was noticeable painful</li>
            <li> I was shocked how well this thing worked.</li>
            <li> if you can&#x27;t afford laser grooming or don&#x27;t want to go through the painful wax</li>
            <li> and I was frustrated that I could not use the trimmer in the shower.  </li>
            <li> Shaving for me has always been painful and never done correct.</li>
            <li> WHY PAY $50 A SESSION EVERY 3 MONTHS FOR WAXING(AND ITS PAINFUL).</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re sick of being the Gorilla in the locker room, use this.</li>
            <li> So I guess I&#x60;m out $50 &amp;#62;:{</li>
            <li> Was disappointed in this item.  </li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Would recommend, You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I hate this thing.</li>
            <li> it won&#x27;t be with the base blade.</li>
            <li> I hate the way it looks.  </li>
            <li> I hate it..</li>
            <li> AND I HATE WEARING SHIRTS!!!</li>
            <li> Nasty stuff!!</li>
            <li> but that is the worst thing I can say about it.</li>
            <li> SO DISAPPOINTING!!!!</li>
            <li> Horrible.</li>
            <li> Terrible product.</li>
            <li> One of the worst products I&#x27;ve ever purchased?</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> works extremely well and super easy to use</li>
            <li> This groomer was not cheap by any means but so far it has worked great. The handle extends to allow you to reach the lower back and the clippers are very sharp and do a great job of trimming the back hair. It recharges which is nice so you don&#x27;t have to worry about batteries.</li>
            <li> It works great for me. Easy to handle. Multiple passes needed but it gets the job done.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant about buying this..but it works like a charm!  Great back hair shaver!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best one made yet. Works great</li>
            <li> Works pretty good but needs to be charged every other week even though I only use it once a week. The double-sided trimmer/foil had to be replaced after 3 months, the foil started coming out and wouldn&#x27;t stay in place. Just keep an eye on the double-sided trimmer/foil to be sure the foil is secure. The foil can come loose while shaving and the blades can leave small cuts on your back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**Update  2/19/2016**&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought the Mangroomer Ultimate Pro back shaver on October 25th 2014, the previous Ultimate Pro would no longer hold a charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;During the Fall of 2015 the plastic lever inside the shock absorber flex head that the double-sided trimmer/foil attaches to broke. I emailed the company asking if they sold just the shock absorber flex head, they said no they don&#x27;t sell that part. They ended up sending a new Mangroomer Ultimate Pro for free since the original was still under warranty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I now have two Mangroomer Ultimate Pro back shavers but only use one, I really wish they offered replacement parts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t start using the replacement back shaver until November of 2015 and the double-sided trimmer/foil just recently started to not trim back hair near as good as it first did. On their website they recommend replacing the double-sided trimmer/foil every 6 months, it hasn&#x27;t been 6 months so I&#x27;m not sure why it isn&#x27;t trimming back hair very good.&lt;br /&gt;I always carefully clean the double-sided trimmer/foil after use to remove any hair, so being dirty isn&#x27;t an issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I emailed the company about 2 weeks ago to ask them why they thought the double-sided trimmer/foil isn&#x27;t trimming back hair very well since I have only been using it for 3 months. I was also worried that maybe the plastic lever inside the shock absorber flex head wasn&#x27;t working properly. I wasn&#x27;t sure if the lever was supposed to move freely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two weeks passed and they never responded to my first email, I sent a 2nd email and still no response. I called the phone number on their website for General Information, that was a complete joke. I told them the company never responded and the person on the phone said send another email. I sent 3 more emails and still no response, I called again and told them the company still isn&#x27;t responding, they said send another email and that the company responds within 24 hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure why the  Mangroomer website says they have a toll free number for General Information, they have an answering service that tells you to email the company for information. I&#x27;m also not sure why they have an email address where customers can supposedly email the company with questions, especially since they do not answer emails..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It sure would be nice is the company would actually respond to emails, I guess they no longer check emails.that was a complete joke.

            <li> I&#x27;m not Ape hairy, but it is a little depressing watching the hair on my back increase as the hair on my head decreases, so I thought I would give this a go.  I didn&#x27;t want the razor handle type out of fear that I would slice up my back.  This shaver is well made, it&#x27;s fairly solid and has good adjustments for angles and length.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say that it does take some time to get use to, and you will occasionally drag an edge over your back rather than the full cutting head, but after a while it will become quick and somewhat easy. The shaver cuts fairly close and the foil cutter even more so.  To be clear it won&#x27;t leave your back razor smooth, but nobody will be tossing you a banana at the pool.</li>
            <li> Works great for all the hard to reach places. I love the fact that you can now shave your back on your own. I would use a mirror though cause it is easy to miss spots. Also it does scrape and leave red marks sometimes, but I really expected that.</li>
            <li> At first I was a little disappointed since I had some trouble &amp;#34;mastering&amp;#34; my technique with the device. But I got the hang of it quickly and now am pleased with the product and the ability to remain clean and hair free back there. Had horrible experiences with waxing, and other alternative was to find someone else to shave it. That could be an embarrassing problem. Not sure why I had to start growing back hair in my late thirties, but am glad to be able to get rid of it now on my own. This is a viable solution you will be glad you have!</li>
            <li> Better than the original but not all the way there yet. I haven&#x27;t tried the boost/beast mode yet. Maybe that will mow down my jungle like that scene from the movie Predator.</li>
            <li> The device is excellent wish I had it years ago. The only trouble I had was that because it came from the US the power cable was the US version</li>
            <li> What a great tool and the attention to customer satisfaction was notable.</li>
            <li> My wife is even happier than me, she doesn&#x27;t have to spend time helping me out shaving my back. Great product!</li>
            <li> So easy to use. Comes with two shaving heads and great price.</li>
            <li> this is a must have!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Nice tool, only they need to work on the heads to make them stronger, sharper, and softer on the skin</li>
            <li> Works well for me but doesn&#x27;t cut quite as well as I hoped.&lt;br /&gt;But the design works well.</li>
            <li> This product arrived earlier than I expected thanks to Amazon!  It&#x27;s a good product but not Great.  It makes a creaking noise when you try to open the Shaver. Every time I open it, I feel like it&#x27;s going to break. Other than that the shaver is okay. You would require at least 2 passes for a smooth shave. It&#x27;s a bit annoying to clean the blades though.  I haven&#x27;t used the 2nd attachment yet. so can&#x27;t say anything on that.. But it does feel sturdy and has a decent reach.  If you can find an extension to Philips Norelco line of products, I would definitely recommend that over this one.</li>
            <li> This thing is awesome. I actually bought the original man groomer when it first came out many years ago. It finally broke after dropping it one too many times.  I thought that one was great until getting this new one. This one is built so much better. It&#x27;s way way sturdier, the rubber handle makes it much easier to grip, and it&#x27;s 100 times more stable when having it extended or positioned in any way. It costs a little more but man it&#x27;s well worth it. The only aspect of it I can&#x27;t comment on is the longevity of the battery. I love that it&#x27;s rechargable instead of having to use 2 AA batteries. That was a pain in the *** having to make sure you always have spare batteries sitting around in case it died. So I love that it&#x27;s rechargable but I just got this new one so I have no idea how many years I will get out of the battery. If you shave your chest or back, you can&#x27;t go wrong buying this thing.</li>
            <li> Nice groomer .very effective for the backside and frontside as well.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for a friend. He seems to be happy with it.</li>
            <li> I like this one much better than the original Mangroomer</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a gift for my husband. He loves it.</li>
            <li> I just finished in 5 minutes what would have normally taken half an hour of awkward positions and objects taped to my electric shaver just to get to hard to reach places. This thing is great!</li>
            <li> Another Awesome product I purchased from Amazon.  I wish I had known about this sooner.  This is a lifesaver.  I have used the normal head and the speed boost and find that works best for me.  I have not used the foil head just yet as the regular head does an excellent job.  It does take a little getting used to the different angles and determining the best arm to use and the right way to use it but once you get your way figured out it works awesome!  I have used this not just on my back but other areas with no problems.  If you are not sure if you should buy it, I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> all super..many thanks!!!</li>
            <li> Mangroomer, I should have bought you sooner, but I let negative reviews cause me to doubt you.  You cut through my back hair like a hot knife through butter!  Please accept my apology in addition to 5 out of 5 stars.</li>
            <li> Are you jewish? Buy one.</li>
            <li> Prompt delivery.  Fantastic device.  So easy to use.  Makes man grooming a breeze.  Weekly maintenance is a non-event. 5-10 minutes tops.  back, shoulders and arms are nice and smooth every time.</li>
            <li> Guys, if you have back or shoulder hair, like I do, stop waiting...go out and get yourself a Mangroomer.  It works really well.  I can&#x27;t believe I had hair on my back for 25 years!  Now it is gone, thanks to the Mangroomer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with this order.</li>
            <li> Works well. Very handy and easy to use. Does just what I hoped it&#x27;d do. No problems in 6 months of use so far.</li>
            <li> Absolutely amazing product for bushmen like me. The second head takes care of the genital hair with ease. Definitely would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> husband liked but he got razor burn in some areas.</li>
            <li> Does everything as advertised. Maybe people with real sensitive skin could have a problem. I didn&#x27;t experience any problems and it works great!</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s start by saying the hair on my back has been growing inversely porpotionate to the speed of my metabolism the past few years. I&#x27;m not at a point where I could take off my shirt and just throw on a mask to be a werewolf at Halloween, but it was getting weird. This crazy device was just what the doctor ordered. It gave my back a lovely trim without too much effort. I left the front side intact though because come on, Magnum P.I.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been working great so far. The trimmer does a good job and the reach is wonderful. The shaver is not so great and doesn&#x27;t get a close shave at all. For the price I hoped it would come with a case or carry bag or something..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not super hairy, kinda just right, lmao. But this shaver works great for the back! Easy and quick clean up of light random groups of hair. I can&#x27;t speak for the sweater folks! Lol</li>
            <li> Works good but not great.  Seems like it pulls and isn&#x27;t sharp.</li>
            <li> Just don&#x27;t like it. I have a ton of body hair and I thought I&#x27;d give it a whirl. I know the routine with these things. The first 2-3 hours after clipping the hair you&#x27;ll feel great. However, if you are quite hairy like I am, it will feel like a huge mistake in the 4th hour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You don&#x27;t shave your face and then go about town wearing a shirt on your face. That would be uncomfortable. So why do this with your body?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have a lot of body hair you have three real options to remove it. Wax ( I&#x27;ve got nothing bad to say about waxing and I&#x27;ve done it many times ), laser treatment and electrolysis. Shaving is NOT an option unless you are cool with devoting one hour of 5 a day to dealing with stubble. Well maybe I&#x27;m sensitive. All I know is, this is not a solution for removing lots of body hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe one of these days there will be applicators for DIY waxing that work like this. That would work. This does not. Save your money and don&#x27;t deal with the hassle of back / shoulder stubble.</li>
            <li> easy to use and does a great job.  can be a little painful but worth it.</li>
            <li> Works better than its brother unit without the extension.  This unit doesn&#x27;t pull or yank at my hair.  Reaches just where I can&#x27;t to complete my manscaping process.</li>
            <li> Is anyone having issues with the battery life? I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s because i use it a lot or leave it charging for too long but i just purchased my second one after having the first for a year and a half. Any feedback would be appreciated.</li>
            <li> I am so upset that this product is such a flop. I got it as a Christmas gift for my husband with high hopes of not needing to assist him with his man grooming any longer. BUT, he attempted using it for the first time the other night and it took him over an hour to shave his chest and 1/2 of his back, stating &amp;#34;I could have used scissors and they would have been more effective&amp;#34;. So of course I needed to use his old electric razor to finish the job. When I went on Amazon to try and return it, I missed the deadline by a month!! So now I&#x27;m stuck with a product that doesn&#x27;t work well and I will still need to spend more money on another product that hopefully will work better :(</li>
            <li> Battery will not hold a charge.  Only operates for a minute or two before it dies, even after full charge.  Also, this device does not operate when it&#x27;s plugged in.</li>
            <li> My husband loved this! He said it works great!!!</li>
            <li> Sorry I didn&#x27;t purchase this item sooner. Works like a charm keeping me well groomed.</li>
            <li> Not bad product, catches on your hair once in a while but over all works well.</li>
            <li> I have the older model of this item that still works great. but this one is a huge improvement. Larger and much more power and the other head allows for a finer trim.</li>
            <li> A little cumbersome but works well.  Its pretty loud.</li>
            <li> Works good but can cause some arm strain when shaving the back.</li>
            <li> does what its supposed to do. however, very stiff hinge on this product that is difficult to move. otherwise A+</li>
            <li> finally!!! A product that my gorilla hands can use to trim my gorilla back....heck I even used this to shave and to get the stubble look.</li>
            <li> This thing barely works. It&#x27;s a nice idea but the second closed attachment does nothing. It should be able to get a closer cut than it does. Especially at the price.</li>
            <li> It seemed like such a brilliant idea and I had high hopes. Unfortunately, this cuts my skin more easily than an adapter for a regular razor, and doesn&#x27;t shave as close. After the first couple uses, I had scratches (not the good kind) on my back that honestly kind of hurt. My advice would be to skip this and go full on razor adapter like the Razorba or something.</li>
            <li> As someone that has a good amount of back hair this machine is a gift from the gods. I used to have someone else just do it for me but that can become a hassle at some point for both parties. I have a lot of smaller hairs on my back so I am very careful to get all of them. Once you figure what method works for you and how you should attack them with the Mangroomer it should reduce the time it takes drastically. It also takes some flexibility on my part but I have only used it a few times. It is a sturdy instrument and gets the job done...just takes some practice.</li>
            <li> on time kind of hard to use</li>
            <li> Works extremely well! If you want a groomer for your back and other areas (arms, chest, legs etc.), this thing works beyond well. The &amp;#34;boost&amp;#34; setting will cut through anything. Get one and stop &amp;#34;silver back&amp;#34; gorillas from hiting the beaches and pools this summer!</li>
            <li> Love the tool. makes fast work of my body hair.  After 6 months I have noticed a decided  drop in cutting action which I suppose comes from normal dulling of the blades. I need to find out who supports the replacement blades and or the re sharpening of the originals.  How else can one by himself dispose of the hair in those hard to reach places so easily?</li>
            <li> this thing charges fast, cuts hair fast, can reach every part of your body, and did I mention its fast? I was able to do my back and front in 5 minutes flat. Im talking thick hair too. Best part is I didnt need to ask for help to get any hard to reach places. This groomer is amazing</li>
            <li> Great deal and nicely done!</li>
            <li> The mangroomer is wonderful for those of us living alone with no significant other to trim those hard to reach hairs off our backs. I love this thing and would highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Great and easy to use</li>
            <li> This thing Rocks! I&#x27;ve used this 4 times now and have had it for a month. This is a lot cheaper than waxing.</li>
            <li> I didnt think it would be such a simple and affective as it really is. It works. My back and balls are smooth.</li>
            <li> Nice product.  Works well. Saves me a lot of time.</li>
            <li> This thing is a life savor, well maybe not life, but definitely helps out A LOT. The &amp;#34;clipper&amp;#34; attachment does great, but I am not a fan of the close up shaver part because it seems to pull a little too much rather then trim. I am very happy with this though and like other comments say, it is light and all plastic; however I feel that if it was heavy it would deter me from using it.</li>
            <li> best back shaver ever made use it for my head as well!!</li>
            <li> Works as advertised. N longer need my wife&#x27;s assistance to shave my back hair!</li>
            <li> Wow!  Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Took a little practice but now have it down to a science. I hope it lasts a long time, when you change angle it sounds like plastic on plastic but we&#x27;ll see how it turns out. It&#x27;s nice to have smooth back.</li>
            <li> I never write reviews but this model really works.  They have upgraded it from previous models and it has locking hinges and is now sturdy enough to actually be useful.  If you are on the fence about it,  buy this one.</li>
            <li> Finally, a very workable solution to a problem i have had for years..well worth the money</li>
            <li> This product is amazing. It removes the hair without nicking or scratching the skin. The \\&quot;teeth\\&quot; on the clippers are really small and - believe it or not - utterly comfortable gliding over the skin. The handle has an adjustable angle which is just perfect for getting anywhere on the back. I used to struggle with using regular hair clippers on my back that were *extremely* difficult to hold onto and get to hard-to-reach areas. I love that the battery for the Mangroomer even came charged. I am so happy with this product, it almost seems too good to be true. With hundreds of positive reviews, I don&#x27;t suppose that mine matters a whole lot, but here it is anyway... for the record.</li>
            <li> I love it. I have some hair on my back and the man groomer makes it to where I can do shave my back with no help.</li>
            <li> Just used it once, but this thing is quality. I love this thing! Easy to use. Powerful. Feels nice in your hand.</li>
            <li> Best one I have ever used!</li>
            <li> OK, so some background on me - I am a pleasant mix between a Sicilian, Yeti, and Wookie.  This means that I always have a sweater on anywhere I go.  Ive tried every &amp;#34;manscaping&amp;#34; product out there, and its always fallen short - either because of the thickness of my hair, or a flaw in the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I got the Mangroomer, I was skeptical - ready for another product that didnt live up to its promise.  But WOW - this thing really works!  It takes some time getting used to having a razor on a stick, but once you get used to the logistics, its a piece of cake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;...now I just have to clean my bathroom...</li>
            <li> Reached everything on the back.</li>
            <li> THE MANGROOMER WORKS GREAT. IT IS A GREAT WAY TO ATTACK, HAIR ON YOUR BACK. THE PRODCT HAS AN EXTENSION BUILT IN TO THE TELESCOPING HANDLE THAT MAKES IT EASY TO MANEUVER THE HARD TO GET AREAS OF YOUR BACK. GREAT FOR OTHER HARD TO REACH AREAS ALSO. WOULD GIVE THIS A THUMBS UP.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the purchase of the Mangroomer for several reasons. First, the item arrived on time, second, it works very well, and third, I was happy to find out that batteries were not required. After the first initial charge, I have used the item for quite a while with out it loosing any power.</li>
            <li> This thing is great.  Why I just now found out this product is offered I dont know but I love it.  I takes a few minutes to get use to shaving in mirror but no big deal.  If you have unwanted back hair this product is for you.</li>
            <li> Great machine.  Had an earlier version with fewer features that finally died.  Like this one much better because a) rechargeable battery, b) alternate foil head c) even foil head has traditional blade feature happening so I don&#x27;t have to switch heads often, c) power boost.</li>
            <li> Does a job great. One note is that it is very loud.</li>
            <li> So, I&#x27;m not a fake reviewer. I put off buying this thing for a while, and I have no idea why. I think I didn&#x27;t want to spend $50. Anyway, if you have back hair that you don&#x27;t like-- and who does-- buy this. You&#x27;ll wonder why you waited after the first use.</li>
            <li> Much better than the cheaper version and rechargeable feature is great.  Makes life for hairy dudes that much easier, believe me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok, still having trouble making sure the razor head is FLAT on my back. Otherwise you get burn marks from the edge of the sharp edge. Glad I don&#x27;t have to use this but once in a while, or I would say forget it. Just don&#x27;t understand why they didn&#x27;t make the head wider. It needs to be 2 times wider or more. LISTEN : MAKE THE RAZOR HEAD 2 TIMES WIDER !!!</li>
            <li> Very easy to use. does a great job at removing &amp; trimming unwanted hair.</li>
            <li> I have owned it 3 months used it twice. Now won&#x27;t turn on broke !</li>
            <li> Gets rid of unwanted hair super quick, wish it had an option of removing the extension handle so I could use it on other areas more easily.</li>
            <li> I gave it a 4 star rating because it does work wonderfully. The only thing holding me back from a 5 star rating is that I owned the Professional version 1 year ago. It broke, which is why I opted to purchase the Super Mega Ultimate Hairy Man version.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To be quite honest, I can not tell a single difference using it between the 2 different versions. My personal advice would be save yourself the few bucks and just get the professional version. Just make sure you keep your receipt and any pertinent info to redeem a warranty replacement!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, great product, just hoping the Ultimate Pro doesn&#x27;t die after a year like it&#x27;s lesser counterpart did for me.</li>
            <li> I love this Product. It does what it&#x27;s suppose to do and most importantly saves me the trip and money from going to one of those hair removal and wax treatment places</li>
            <li> Bought this after I dropped the older version on my marble bathroom floor and cracked the base. This version is clearly much more durable.&lt;br /&gt;Pros-&lt;br /&gt;  1. I do think it trims closer and cleaner then it&#x27;s predecessor and leaves less scratches&lt;br /&gt;  2. added a boost button. The red button on the front of the trimmer intensifies the trim by at least double the power and is great  for thick haired  areas or just generally a quicker trim.&lt;br /&gt;  3. the added shaver head is a huge upgrade. you can now get a true shave as opposed to just a very close trim&lt;br /&gt;Cons-&lt;br /&gt;  1. just like the earlier version you can not use the trimmer while it is charging (charge gives about 90 min of trim time)&lt;br /&gt;  2. Very difficult to use on chest or front of body. the nature of the extension piece makes it awkward to trim your chest or face so you will need a second trimmer if you wish to go full body smooth. Perhaps future versions will allow the trimmer to fold up in the reverse direction so that the shaver head can still be used when the extension is closed&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all a very good product. NOTE: I bought mine at Target bc I have store credit. If you show the customer service the amazon price on your phone they will match this price.</li>
            <li> Takes a little time to get used to it but what a life saver!</li>
            <li> My hubby loves this, it&#x27;s easy to use and is sturdy!</li>
            <li> Decided to splurge on this. I don&#x27;t have a particularly hairy back, but the ability to clean up the stray hairs is nice.  All my other shavers these days are water proof, which is why I am knocking a star. I would much prefer to use this in the shower than have to clean up the bathroom floor</li>
            <li> Great product, exactly as described, make the job a whole lot easier.</li>
            <li> love the mangroomer...great seller..would buy again</li>
            <li> Just used mangroomer for the first time today, I must say after years of having my girl friend and my son shaving my back, this  item is awesome and easy to use and I can do it myself and don&#x27;t need anyone&#x27;s help.  I have used other shavers but nothing as easy to use as this.  If you are having apprehensions please don&#x27;t try it your love it!!!!  Thanks to the person who invented this,  wish I would have had this item years ago!!!</li>
            <li> eh, mediocre item at best. like the long arm, but the clippers, even on the heavy setting are not great. wouldn&#x27;t recommend this item</li>
            <li> This is a good unit.  I have had several others and they were uncomfortable, pinched and yanked at the hair.  This shaver works really well, use to have a female friend shave my back with a t edger (small clipper}  and always had to wait until she had time. This unit works as well as she did, lol, thus I don&#x27;t have to ask anybody and it shaves close and does a pretty darn good job.  Recommended for hairy backed guys.</li>
            <li> Okay, after wrestling around with trying to find a true man capable groomer (and wasting a lot of money along the way), this actually delivered on it&#x27;s promise. The handle extends and rotates and locks in a wide variety of positions. Being cordless means it&#x27;s very easy to maneuver and use without tripping over the cord or dragging half of your bathroom counter contents onto the floor. The trimmer has plenty of power for even thick hair, and the included close shaver (foil screen) does a decent job at keeping things smooth. I&#x27;ve used mine for 30-40 minutes at a time with no loss of power. It cleans up easily, and folds in half for easy storage. Pros - Works great, easy to maneuver, powerful, heads change easily, locking handle Cons - None so far. Best of all, unlike other trimmers I have used, it leaves no marks on my back or body. I love it and would recommend this to other guys who need to trim up!</li>
            <li> Excellent product. This item is invaluable for a man with unwanted back hair. All you need is a mirror and yourself. No help required. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Lots of reviews say they aren&#x27;t impressed with the clippers but that the foil head shaver works well.  All I can say about the clipper head is BEST BACK SCRATCHER EVER!!!  I&#x27;m going to use this every day just to scratch the spot inside the shoulder blade that I can&#x27;t reach.  Holy cow.</li>
            <li> I really  like this machine i use it twice a week.&lt;br /&gt;You will like as well go get yourself one</li>
            <li> Item delivered on time, was as described.</li>
            <li> This is a replacement for a 4 or 5 year old original model. I liked the old one but it finally got too dull cut the fur; so I wanted the same brand. This ultimate pro is worth the extra $ for the improvements and bells and whistles but the original model will get the job done. I like the rechargeable batteries with charge indicator light and I like the flex head. I did not use the foil head yet since the basic head leaves a plenty smooth shave. I will try that later for a touch up.</li>
            <li> Okay - I&#x27;ll admit. I used to be &amp;#34;that guy&amp;#34;. The one that always asked my wife to help me shave my back before we went to a pool or a beach.&lt;br /&gt;that was fine the first ten years of our marriage, but the last 5 years or so.. I sense she&#x27;s gotten a bit tired of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did recruit my adult daughter once, but she only agreed to it after I threatened to ask her Boyfriend to shave me instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I had looked at something like this before, but was skeptical. I&#x27;ve seen the ones that use a straight razor instead, and that just sounds like a recipe for disaster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So instead of taping one of my regular clippers to a stick.. I decided to go ahead and spurge for this. I have not regretted it.&lt;br /&gt;The shave is surprisingly close and it doesn&#x27;t take long to get used to the way this works. I&#x27;ve yet to use the smaller head because the bigger one seems to work fine. The shape is such that shaving the back and sides is relatively easy, but it was a bit more awkward to use on my neck and other parts that aren&#x27;t behind me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All and all it&#x27;s working exactly as I would like it to. The only thing that I&#x27;m uncomfortable with is the loud clicking that you have to make when you adjust it open and closed. It sounds like I&#x27;m breaking it. But other than that I have no complaints.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would have probably given it 4 stars because I expected it to be a bit more solid... but my wife and daughter give it 10 stars each (becaus they don&#x27;t have to shave me anymore), so I figure five stars was appropriate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy!</li>
            <li> This is nothing more than a rechargeable trimmer/razor on an extendable arm and it&#x27;s expensive for what it is. That said, if you&#x27;ve ever tried to shave your back hair with an electric or manual razor you know just how hard it is to reach all the areas, especially between and under the shoulder blades. This worked well on the first try with no missed spots and I would buy it again.  It comes with two heads, the one installed and another head for a closer shave.  I just used the installed one and it shaved close enough for me.  Now I&#x27;ll be ready for the pool this summer.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t shave close awkward to to use handle is just to much can&#x27;t just pull it off</li>
            <li> My buddies told me about the mangroomer product so I went to buy it from amazon and noticed they just release this new version of their back shaver.  I decided to go with the ultimate version - (only 10 bucks more).  Received it in the mail 2 days, (cool packaging) charged it up overnight and tried it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The unit is super solid and is easy to control.  I started out with the trimmer attachment because I have not shaved my back in about 1 year - so i have some pretty decent growth.  I opened it up fully as the instructions stated to get the best angle and turned it on.  I started shaving on my upper shoulder blades/upper back and moved over the area a few times.  No pulling or pain, no irration.  They also have this turbo button that kicks the shaver into hi-gear for super hairy patches.  After cleaning up my upper back, I extended the handle about half way and locked it into to place with their red locking button and continued to work my way down and around my back.  I then fully extended the handle to reach a patch of hair in my lower back (you now that spot when you have an itch and can&#x27;t reach :).  Wow and my back was looking great!!!  I then switched out the attachments to the body grooming one - it gets a much closer shaver - really close and smooth. So far, I am a big fan this product - really awesome and I receommend to any dude who hates their back and wants it removed effortlessly.</li>
            <li> Makes the wife very happy which in turn makes me very happy</li>
            <li> Item arrived on time and as advertised</li>
            <li> Great tool. Use it frequently. Good quality, in unopened package as stated</li>
            <li> This thing is Awesome!!  It has enough power to cut the hair without hitting the boost button.  It does exactly what it is meant to do with ease.</li>
            <li> Works great. I&#x27;m impressed</li>
            <li> does what it claimed it would do.  very pleased</li>
            <li> Seriously shocked how well this thing works. Be patient the first time, even a weed wacker gets stuck once and a while.</li>
            <li> Awesome product! Works as advertised and I love it.</li>
            <li> Very helpful if you don&#x27;t have someone to help you shave your back. Otherwise, you can achieve the same result with a little help from a significant other...or friend who will help you out, if you have a regular electric and/or blade razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Result are good: use both heads.  The coarse head to cut longer hairs, then the smooth head to get a closer shave.  Fortunately this type of body hair seems to grow slower than scalp hair....so you don&#x27;t have to shave daily....well, at least I don&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hinge is a bit stiff...at first I was worried I was going to break it.</li>
            <li> My husband loves the mangroomer, as do I!!!  Easy to use, and no more hair on his back.  Now I don&#x27;t have to shave him anymore  :-)</li>
            <li> Best Product Ever for Back Shaving!!!!</li>
            <li> Its big and looks rugged and does what its supposed to do. The power button is a bit touchy and if you put it in a suitcase chances are that it will start buzzing at the first touch. If you travel its better if you put it in the suitcase discharged so ther will be no surprises at the airport.</li>
            <li> Amazing how great it works. Can reach anywhere with the extensiona and folding razor.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had a lot of shame about my back hair, which was ample.  This thing made it trivial to make it completely disappear.  Yes, it can scratch a little when you&#x27;re in &amp;#34;weed-whacker&amp;#34; mode with the initial trimmer, getting most of the length gone.  Grin and bear it, it&#x27;s worth it.  The foil shaver does an excellent job cleaning up afterwards and left my back soft and smooth.  Combine with some exfoliation in the shower and it was like the hair was never there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have back hair and wish you didn&#x27;t, invest the $50.  It&#x27;s 100% worth it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a few times and it works well going against the &amp;#34;grain&amp;#34; of your hair but if you have a hard time going in that direction it does not cut well. So it all depends on each persons direction of hair growth.</li>
            <li> Great product, exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> This is a great product that works as advertised. It takes a few uses to get used to the best way to use it for your body, but once you get it dialed in it works better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried. I hope it lasts a long time - I&#x27;ve been using for 4 months or so now without any discernible loss in function.  Just to note - I&#x27;m hairy but not Sasquatch hairy (yet). Best to use it often to keep the weeds at bay than to try to weed whack periodically.</li>
            <li> This is a seriously good product and well worth the money.  If you need a good grooming tool, do yourself a favor and get this one.  Gives a high quality body trim without the contortions required from other products.  I am a pretty frugal person, and I have no regrets whatsoever about this purchase.</li>
            <li> Felt a need to write another review about how much I love this thing.  I&#x27;ve had it now for 2 years  and still no issues.  I use it at least once a week and have not had to replace blades yet.  The shaver works greater than any I&#x27;ve come across for the price.  If you don&#x27;t like scaring the kids at the pool when you take your shirt off this is the product for you.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband for christmas and after a few others he has used and been dissappointed this one was a TOTAL WINNER !!!!!  It is Very Well Made ands works GREAT !!!! It also takes very little time for him to do his back. I have to add that the first time he used it he did have a couple red marks that stung for a couple days but he said that it was his fault. He had to get used to how much pressure to apply. He has never had it happen again and would tell anyone looking for a body groomer this one is the one they should get !!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> My husband has wanted one of these for a while and this is a hit!  He now can wear any shirt.. LOL, or no shirt, at the gym and won&#x27;t have to feel like people might be whispering about back hair (hee hee)</li>
            <li> This shaver works ok to shave your back, but it will cut you up if you aren&#x27;t careful. I ended up with scratches all over my back after using it. Also, the handle isn&#x27;t detachable, so it&#x27;s awkward to use when shaving any other parts of your body, which means you have to buy another shaver to do the job. It&#x27;s basically a one trick pony.</li>
            <li> Works perfect just what I was looking for</li>
            <li> This product shipped timely and was a snap to install. The fit was what you would expect from an OEM product and the quality was totally acceptable.</li>
            <li> Awesome product ,  I wish I would have bought it years ago</li>
            <li> 55 year old Italian man in great shape but too embarassed to take off my shirt in public. Ordered the Mangroomer Ultimate with 5-7 day shipping and received it in 3 days. Used the first head for long hair and second head to take it closer and finished in 40 minutes-not bad for first time. It&#x27;s not a vanity issue though-I&#x27;m a big guy who sleeps on his back with a ceiling fan wide open. I wake up in the middle of the night sweating-not any more-first night after using the Mangroomer I had to turn down the ceiling fan. Bedsheets never felt cooler against my back. Wife was shocked-then she cuddled up against my back when I rolled onto my side...thanks Mangroomer!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this body shaver to replace the one I had for several years that had died.  This one is superior in every way.  The length and adjustable angle is well suited to reaching all areas of the back and it is light enough to not become tiring.  The second pass with the alternate shaver head leaves a smooth surface on the skin while catching the stray missed hairs from the first pass.  Of course there is a learning curve to figure out how to stand, turn, and switch hands to reach everywhere but with a second hand held mirror and a little time you can get a great result.</li>
            <li> Excellent!!! Fast shipping! A great product</li>
            <li> The groomer is going to scratch your back painfully</li>
            <li> This was a great update from the original.  There are two models of the new one...if you don&#x27;t need all of the bells and whistles get the other model...my biggest concern was that the hinge was too loose...They fixed it in the new one and I don&#x27;t even need the lock out feature.</li>
            <li> About two months in this product is still awesome. I am a hairy guy on my back and shoulders and this product makes quick work of that.  It also doubles as a beard trimmer.</li>
            <li> What a great solution to waxing. I&#x27;m not super worried about back hair but when you go to the beach and you don&#x27;t want to look like sasquash this is your go too. Lots of settings and adjustables. Easy to use.</li>
            <li> I used this product for the first time the other day.  It is terrific.  All of the positive reviews here were correct.  I did experience a few scratches but I expected that.  The foil head does a great clean up job.  Just take your time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No regrets.  Buy this.  It works.</li>
            <li> Does the job......like a lawn mower!</li>
            <li> Within a month of purchasing this item the trimmer stopped working and would pull my hair instead of trimming it.</li>
            <li> Great in taking hair of the back. Only recomendation I have for future design is to have a attachment that is wider for bigger guys.</li>
            <li> Was an excellent device to shave your back hair, I just decided that I really didn,t want to be clean shaven after-all and gave it to a friend. &amp;#34;Once a Bear, Alway&#x27;s a Bear&amp;#34; :)</li>
            <li> This is the best product ever.  Holds a charge forever and as long as your consistent it maintains a nice and shorn body!</li>
            <li> Everything I expected.</li>
            <li> Would recommend this.  It takes a bit getting used to with adjusting the length and different angles, but all in all a good purchase.</li>
            <li> heavy duty and the arm locks so there is no slippage.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing! Easily shaved my untamed back and front within 15 minutes. With the second attachment all I have to do is maintain once a week. Great product and well worth the money.</li>
            <li> Just got my Mangroomer Ultimate Pro Back Shaver today and it works GREAT!!!  I LOVE IT!!!  No more trying to shave with a razor that is too short!!  This item was very well made! IT IS MADE HEAVY DUTY as I was EXPECTING  something cheap and light weight! It usually takes me about 20 minutes to shave my back with a razor because of the hard to reach areas.  I was done in less than 5 minutes!  If you are a guy like me that likes going shirtless but are embarrassed of the back hair then I would highly recommend this!!!  I am already thinking about ordering a second one to keep in my camper.  SUMMERS IS COMING AND I HATE WEARING SHIRTS!!!</li>
            <li> Very good back shaver.</li>
            <li> Had the standard model and was not happy with it decided to try the pro and was Very pleased with it great job on this design</li>
            <li> I just used my shaver for the first time last night and I just have to say; I love this! I takes some getting used to (shaving backwards in the mirror) but once my brain adjusted it was fine. Just move slowly and deliberately and it does a great job. I did the trimming last night and will do the shaving head tonight(like an electric razor). Haven&#x27;t had my back this smooth since my now ex-wife used to trim it! It seems like a solid piece of equipment and well thought out design.</li>
            <li> Works very well.  I&#x27;ve only had it a short while, but no issues.</li>
            <li> Worked great for a few times but didn&#x27;t turn on after the fourth time using. Other than that great product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other razors for back grooming and this one by far exceeds the closeness and ease of use than any of the others. The multiple angled handle makes it simple to get at those odd spots that flexibility no longer allows. The two heads are perfect for managing that clean neat look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s GROOMTASTIC</li>
            <li> Where was this thing about 25 years ago?!?! I received my MANGrooomer Ultimate Pro in 2 days (even in the midst of  snow storm) as expected and it was packaged very well. I opened the package and read the instructions from end to end before attempting to use it. They state to let the unit charge for 18 to 24 hours before use so that&#x27;s what I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About 18.5 hours later I got comfortable with the way the unit adjusted/operated and started in. Now I should say that I was one of the first of my friends growing up to get body/facial hair. Sadly it doesn&#x27;t seem to have ever stopped! I&#x27;m now 45 and while I haven&#x27;t ever let my hairy presentation deter me from doing what I wanted (beach, pool, etc.), I&#x27;ve always been very uncomfortable with my appearance. And while my hair wasn&#x27;t the thick, brillo-pad style I&#x27;ve seen on some unfortunate guys out there, it was more than what I ever wanted on my body. I went the Nair route once and let&#x27;s just say I only went that way once for a reason!! Nasty stuff!! One of the issues I faced is that there really wasn&#x27;t a place to &amp;#34;stop shaving&amp;#34; if I had someone shave my back which meant shaving my &amp;#34;front&amp;#34; and arms too. Who wants to bother someone with that all of the time?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I fire up the MANGroomer for its maiden voyage and I&#x27;ll admit, I was a bit skeptical after seeing some of the negative reviews. I thought for sure I was going to end up one of those guys with the &amp;#34;hair type&amp;#34; that the MANGroomer wouldn&#x27;t cut through or whatever. The instructions say to make slow passes to prevent pulling the hair out. So I make a couple of slow passes on my upper back/shoulder area and ... holy crap ... the hair&#x27;s gone! And no pain! No redness! No smell! So I continue...I was able to do my whole back thanks to the way the MANGroomer is designed. Because the human-wool on my back was rather thick, I opted for the trimmer blade versus the close-cut/razor blade. It removed the hair so short you could barely seeit. You could feel the stubble if you ran a hand across my back, but really not bad at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because there was no good stopping point as I mentioned earlier, I continued to do the rest of my body. One of the other concerns I had was whether or not I&#x27;d be able to use this everywhere or if I&#x27;d have to buy yet another groomer for the rest of my body. I was able to maneuver the MANGroomer so as to get everything trimmed up - arms, legs, torso, etc. It left a little more on my chest than everywhere else but that hair seems thicker than the rest. It was still very close...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was able to do my entire body without recharging and the motor didn&#x27;t seem to be slowing down. Still, before I used it again I thought it best to plug it in and charge it up. After charging the unit for 2-3 hours and allowing me and my body to adjust to it&#x27;s new-found environment, I swapped heads on the MANGroomer and tried out the closer-shaving head on my back. It&#x27;s a little tougher to use than the trimmer only because of the angle you have to hold the MANGroomer at to get the head to sit flat. But just the same, it worked pretty well. I&#x27;ll use a regular razor for the areas I can reach and save the MANGroomer for the back areas I can&#x27;t reach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cannot tell you how great I feel! This was long overdue. What made me finally decide to go forward with this is a recent vacation where I was the only guy at the pool/beach who wasn&#x27;t man-scaped. Evidently, gone are the days where guys who shave their bodies are not the norm. I feel so much better about myself and cannot wait until the next vacation or pool party so I can show-off my new self! Another perk, the muscle tone that was lurking beneath the forest of man-fur is now on display for all to see. Good days ahead!</li>
            <li> Finally I can groom without saying, &amp;#34;Hon, can you come trim my back?&amp;#34; Now I can do this in the privacy of my bathroom without the constant, &amp;#34;Dang, that&#x27;s a lot of hair!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> This is a great trimmer for the hard to reach places. I have spent a ridiculous amount of time trying to trim the hair in the mid section of my back. I am by no means extremely hairy but as I got older more and more hair kept showing up back there. This did the trick. No more stretching and maneuvering into awkward positions trying to trim. It is a little loud but that is the worst thing I can say about it.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve got hair in hard to reach places, then this is a lifesaver.  This model is much improved over the original.  Couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li> Best mangroomer I have purchased</li>
            <li> Great Product....it does what it says it will do and does it well. Comfortable to use.</li>
            <li> Too long. Seems to be geared for a Big Foot!</li>
            <li> Blades seems to be very sharp, no pulling. Battery has a long enough charge to shave whole body with plenty of power. Little hard to get use to the angle of the handle as it doesn&#x27;t fold out straight. Takes a while but one can shave his back with no assistance. Overall a nice shaver for the money.</li>
            <li> Awesome groomer, worked great and easy to handle. I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> As an owner of the original man groomer, I was happily surprised with this one. The fact that it has a more powerful rechargeable battery is great, and the heads are much more like a traditional trimmer. If you&#x27;re not careful, you can scrape yourself a bit, but you just need to keep it at the right angles. It&#x27;s totally worth the price, just keep it clean and don&#x27;t get the head get corroded!</li>
            <li> Ok so I have hair on my back and it has always been something that has not helped with my confidence. Wouldn&#x27;t take my shirt off at a pool,spa ocean you name it. Why did I wait so long to try this?? Worked perfect the first time and very easy to maintain. Great product highly recommend</li>
            <li> I used this for the first time today.  Wow.  I never knew such a thing existed.  I&#x27;ve got to say that it took a few minutes to figure out how to use it properly.  You know with the angles and such  I think the price is a little high for a glorified beard trimmer on a stick.  It still scratched my back a little but I&#x27;m sure that will change with time and practice.  However, with that being said it worked.  I forgot what it felt like to wear clothes and actually have them touch my back.  I find my backs colder now without it when I don&#x27;t have a shirt on.  But I have to say I no longer fear the swimming pool.  It&#x27;s worth the $59 bucks just for that.</li>
            <li> works better than I thought the extra attachment also very good, impressed</li>
            <li> I bought one of these and the head popped off and wouldn&#x27;t reattach.  I even ordered a replacement head and that one wouldn&#x27;t reattach either.  Its been in a drawer, useless, every since.</li>
            <li> Every man should have one. This is amazing and am truly satisfied and impressed with it.</li>
            <li> Hey guys.  I&#x27;ll tell you right now.  My back is fury!  If I let it go that route.  But this device is a sure thing.  My back is smooth with this device.  Very easy to use and the last one I had lasted 6 years.  This one is the big upgrade for me and big difference.  Worth every penny and then some!!!!  I use it twice a week and feel better about myself.  Trust me, women don&#x27;t want to see a hairy back.  I have a lot more confidence in myself about using this.</li>
            <li> I had the old Mangroomer. It took a lot of pressure and many strokes to get the job done on my back. It was a tedious chore. Even with the angled, articulated arm, it was a bit of contortionism.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, this iteration is OUTSTANDING. Both heads get the hair with almost a single pass. The single blade cutter gets very close but the best is the foil head with the dual clipping edges. The dual clippers are fine enough for some sensitive areas. I would say fine enough for the perineum but not for the scrotum...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, for the back?!?!?!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Frankly, it got so close as to make me feel smooth as silk. There was NO razor burn and NO stray hairs. This is an outstanding product. If you want to rid yourself of back hair and you want to maintain it on a regular basis then I fully recommend this. You cannot go wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, while I just got it and cannot speak to it&#x27;s longevity, I can say that the Mangroomer feels very well made. Not cheap at all. I think that this will stand up to some heavy use. Also, if I remember correctly, replacement heads are available. This is the answer that all of us have been looking for.</li>
            <li> This is the groomer to get. I have tried others - even other mangroomer products and non stack up to this one</li>
            <li> Very well made, ive tried ever else as far as machines, this is the best, got 2 of my friends to but as well, very happy with this purchase</li>
            <li> I just love this product.  it just does everything it says it will.  Using it takes some time to make sure the shaving head is hitting square on the part of the body shaved, but the adjustable arm makes it foolproof.</li>
            <li> Excellent product for back hair removal.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend</li>
            <li> Nice product, easy to use</li>
            <li> Works great.  No complaints after 3 uses. Doesn&#x27;t pull the hair even on the first use.</li>
            <li> Fabulous! I love not having to Nair my husband&#x27;s back. The long  arm allows my husband to reach the unreachable section of his back without my help. Easy to store and travel with. Great grooming tool. The only downside is the blade. Made his back really red.</li>
            <li> The perforated protective cover on the cutting head ripped in the first week, which causes the hair to get caught between the cutting wheel and the cover and pinches a lot. The bigger head caused way to much scratching of the skin.</li>
            <li> shaver head does not work as good as older model</li>
            <li> This is an ingenuous product.  It works great.  However the red locking button came off my unit as I took it out of the package.  This is used to push to lock when you like the angle at which the unit is bent.  But it doesn&#x27;t appear as though it&#x27;s required.  I mean the fold action is such that it takes quite a lot of pressure to bend it back and forth, so locking it doesn&#x27;t add a whole lot of value.  Suffice to say, even without locking it, after you bend it as you like it, it won&#x27;t move around when in use, so in my opinion the locking mechanism is unnecessary, so no big deal that my locking button fell off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, the product works as advertised if not better.  A great deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only took a star off because of the quality issue.</li>
            <li> Be sure to charge the shaver first before using.  I wanted to give this bad boy a try the moment it arrived and did not bother to charge it first.  It shaved half my back before running out of juice that left my back resembling that of a zebra.  I went and showed the partial results to my son and he said, &amp;#34;You&#x27;re gross.&amp;#34;  It was fun cleaning the sink full of hair too.  Amazing product!  It shaved great!  It is lightweight but powerful.  It felt like a tickling back scratch to me.  Be sure to press lightly against your back  (as stated in instructions) or it will feel not feel very good.  One reviewer criticized this shaver claiming to still feel hair stubble and that is correct.  It did not make my back baby smooth but the hair stubble is not visible.  It is only visible in light with someone looking close for it.  Maybe others know how to use the product to get an ultra close shave but it is more than sufficient for me.  I&#x27;m just happy nobody is throwing me bananas any more!</li>
            <li> I was a bit sceptical at first. However I must say that the product is superb. It works flawlessly and does the best job I have ever had. Saves me from the indignity of asking my wife and affords the opportunity in the privacy of my home. No more waxing and now I feel comfortable wearing singlets/gym tops without the hassle and comments from close friends and work colleagues. Construction is brilliant and the functionality is even better. Without a doubt the best lifestyle and personal grooming purchase I have ever made. It arrived quickly and as described no hassles. At the purchase price it was a real steal, actually if it was to ever break then I would still re purchase another item even if the price was at $200.00 the product was definitely worth every cent it cost me. Well done to the team at Man groomer functionality, craftsmanship and dignity all in a small package that&#x27;s cheaper than a box of cans.</li>
            <li> It was great when it worked.  However don&#x27;t expect these to last long.  Mine only lasted about 4 shaves in total.  And if you take it on a trip, the button is so sensitive that it will turn on in your luggage and die.  They really need to fix the quality and the design flaws of this unit.  I have contacted Mangroomer to see if they will replace it and will adjust my rating accordingly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  I am giving Mangroomer 4 stars.  I emailed them and within 12 hours they had emailed me back and will be sending me a new product.  I don&#x27;t even have to send back the dead one.  Great customer service!  If this product lasts at least 6 months without dying, I&#x27;ll be changing my review to 5 stars.  When it worked, it was awesome - the best shaver I&#x27;ve owned.  I just hope that the quality is up to par to keep it running.  I won&#x27;t be traveling with it however as the button gets pushed every time.</li>
            <li> Great Vary easy to use&lt;br /&gt;everything they said it was</li>
            <li> This thing works really good. I wish I had heard about it years ago.</li>
            <li> It really works well and does its purpose, definitely an upgrade from the last model! Sturdy and feels great, I haven&#x27;t had it pull even longer hairs.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product.  Works as expected.  The non electric options from other suppliers are just not convenient.  It&#x27;s the only electric choice with the reach needed that I found.</li>
            <li> 24 Hours ago, I was browsing the internet trying to find a way to shave my back hair myself. 3 hours ago, the post man delivered the Mangroomer to my door step. 15 minutes ago, I had a back full of hair. 4 minutes ago I was sitting down at my computer, HAIR FREE, to write this review. It took me 8 minutes to shave my back. My ex wife used to shave my back for me, but its been about 6 year since that happened. Having a hairy back poses self-confidence issues when trying to date, and its always on a mans mind the first time he gets intimate with a lady. No more! I LOVE this thing. Now I might start tanning!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have back hair and are considering buying this, just do it. Its awesome.</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to!</li>
            <li> I am rather hairy guy!  I work out a lot and hate back hair. Until getting this I felt like I would never get rid of the unwanted fur!  This is long enough to reach all spots on my back!  Now I can go to the pool worry free!  Also it works great on body hair but I don&#x27;t recommend manscaping with this ( I&#x27;m sure there are better ways!)</li>
            <li> Outstanding product ! I am finally now a self sufficient American male ! The only thing that could possibly make this product ANY better, is another pair of eyes in the back of my head !! This Shaver is a MUST for all men with back hair issues ! Enuf said !!</li>
            <li> Product arrived on time and worked as advertised. I have not used it long enough to say whether I would purchase it again and  would recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> The Mangroomer is easy to use and dose a great job! My expectations of this product are completely satisfied. Thank you</li>
            <li> works as described I love it! I am no longer a hairy beast lol. It feels kinda cheap at the extension, but other than that its great</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried all sorts of things to make removing back and shoulder hair. The Mangroomer Ultimate Pro Back Shaver is really a simple and quick way to get the job done. The mangroomer feels well built when you hold it and simple to use. I find short repetitive strokes help you get a closer shave, it takes less then 8min to do my back and shoulders, I like that it also came with 2 blade options I used the wide groomer blade only 1 time and been using the  foil body groomer bi-directional head every 1-2 weeks. Overall I am glade I purchased this it does exactly what it says it&#x27;s made for.</li>
            <li> I have so many gizmos for shaving and trimming that I hesitated for a long time before buying this one but it really is worth every penny. I can finally reach all over my back and I no longer feel like a contortionist doing it! If you can&#x27;t decide, stop tormenting yourself. Just buy it. Any man who has lived with back hair will not regret it. Period.</li>
            <li> *Edit and update 5/11/14&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;well my man groomer finally died and I went to charge it for the first time, to my surprise the female connector on the charger pack does not fit inside the male connector on the man groomer....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;called up mangroomer and the lady on the phone said she could only help me take an order she could not assist me with customer service issues&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;let me just say that nothing is more annoying than a company admitting that they are willing to provide you with help if you&#x27;re trying to buy something but if you just need help with a product you already bought then they don&#x27;t really care&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I emailed man groomer and nearly 3 weeks later I have not heard back, man groomer is a great product but what good is a great product when you cannot charge it up and the company refuses to assist you&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have bad back hair, its really embarrassing, there&#x27;s nothing worst than spending the night with a chick and she finds out you&#x27;re secretly the Wolfman, I was married at one point and my wife wasn&#x27;t exactly turned on by it either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyways my brothers got tired of shaving my back for me, I would go through painful waxes and my hair would grow back almost as fast as if I had shaved. My back hair is coarse so I didn&#x27;t want a cheap flimsy shaver so I opted for the ultimate pro version of this shaver, it works great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is actually so powerful that it can actually give you some nasty nicks if you have fat rolls so be careful!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shaver works great all over my body and when my beard gets super chick it chops it right off no problems, I have used it on my upper pubic area directly below my stomach but wont dare to use it on the sensitive parts below that, it is just too powerful and the blade is unguarded&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not used the foil attachment, those never seem to work so I just use the standard razor&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s no reason to beat around the bush on your back fellas, if its a jungle back there then get this thing already and stop scarring people for crying out loud!er seem to work so I just use the standard razor&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s no reason to beat around the bush on your back fellas, if its a jungle back there then get this thing already and stop scarring people for crying out loud!</li>
            <li> Amazing product, very useful. Happy with the results. Easy to use.</li>
            <li> Did not work well for me.</li>
            <li> Thank you to the inventor of this back shaver!!!!! I was very skeptical at first, but after I used it I was like wow, wow, wow lol, you get it :)</li>
            <li> Amazing product. The reach is the key and its sturdy to the point where you can apply pressure. It shaves close enough to be compared to a razor. The trimmer is also great and doesn&#x27;t leave scratch marks.</li>
            <li> Works great and I don&#x27;t have to awkwardly ask my roommates to help me shave anymore</li>
            <li> This has honestly helped change my self-image so much for the better. The product is easy to use, durable (from what I can tell so far) and does its job flawlessly! I would recommend this to absolutely anyone who wishes to keep back hair away - It&#x27;s the best Amazon purchase I&#x27;ve ever made.</li>
            <li> Yes it reaches. Yes it is awkward. No it does not shave well if at all. Wish I would have thought twice before placing this order.</li>
            <li> The first mangroomer I had stop working. Had that one for about a year. This one is much better. I only use the one attachment. I really don&#x27;t have a use for the other one. Only use the charger that comes with it. I think that is why my other one stoped working.</li>
            <li> Great product. I have tried everything and this is hands down the best!! No more waiting to have my wife shave my back. I do it when I want it done and I do a better job!</li>
            <li> After years of using various methods for hair removal this is the best yet! Quick and very little clean up...also customer service is terrific and very responsive. I would definitely purchase again from this company.</li>
            <li> Better than expected product. Seemed light and cheap, but far from it. Would recommend this to anyone who needs such a thing!</li>
            <li> This is a well-made tool that accomplishes its purpose very well. It is long enough to reach all areas although I find it necessary to use my left hand for some areas and that is a little awkward. The cutting heads both function very well.&lt;br /&gt;For me it&#x27;s great to be able to remove body hair whenever I please and not have to wait until I can get someone to do my back. The Mangroomer has made that possible.&lt;br /&gt;I had a problem with my unit: the charging light did not turn green when the charge was complete. The company immediately replaced the unit and did not require me to return the defective unit. All companies should be so eager to satisfy their customers.</li>
            <li> As a hairy man, let me say. Thank you for this product. Well built, works great.</li>
            <li> Although calling the Mangroomer &amp;#34;life-changing&amp;#34; may be a bit of a stretch, it&#x27;s certainly life-enhancing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had it for less than 12 hours and simply can&#x27;t believe how freaking easy it made this previously annoying and/or somewhat embarrassing task. My back was silky smooth in less than 20 minutes after getting it out of its package (which itself was no small feat). That even includes the time it took me to read the manual mid-shave to figure out how to change out the heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What&#x27;s more, I was able to do it with no assistance from my wife (you just need a lot of good light and a full length mirror).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously awesome product.</li>
            <li> Better than last one I bought, wish it had battery back up - doesn&#x27;t scratch, opening is very stiff but has not broke</li>
            <li> This thing works great my wife use to have to do this now i can do it my self easily</li>
            <li> This shaver does the job in a perfect way.</li>
            <li> I have a huge body hair problem.. shaving my chest is easy, shaving my back not so much.. This is without a doubt the easiest and best product to use for shaving your back when you don&#x27;t have a special someone to do it for you. It is quick, easy, and very effective at shaving your back. The long handle and bent angles you can put it at makes it so you can easily reach any spot on your back, and the trimmer just works magic. Possibly the most valuable invention known to mankind.</li>
            <li> Extends long enough to reach everywhere, interchangeable heads for clipper and shaver.  Charge last multiple uses.</li>
            <li> I have to say, I&#x27;m impressed. Frustrated with my struggles to remove the forest growth, I used this cool new thing called the internet and asked using the keywords: back hair shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let&#x27;s preface this by saying that I have been embarrassed by back hair my whole life. I finally gave up and just let it be.  I tried waxing it: temporary success. Nair: stinky, messy, and not able to cut through the whole forest. Plus you need an accomplice. Same with a razor, and then I just started using a hair clipper and many different configurations, including duct taping an extension to it, which didn&#x27;t work. And laser removal? What a joke.  Thousands of dollars wasted, multiple multiple (that was intended) sessions, with the equivalent of going after an overgrown football stadium with a weedwacker, one follicle at a time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When it came, I was admittedly a little disappointed.  The package was light (good things are heavy). The package it came in required a cutting torch to get through it- well, not that bad, but I had to track down scissors, which is unusual for me. I looked it over, then plugged in the charger to get it ready for the morning, thinking, I&#x27;d give it a shot and if it wasn&#x27;t what I wanted, I&#x27;d send it back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is light so you can hold it and maneuver it.  The extensions were amazing.  It made short work of my back and I had so much time left over I went around front as well. I look like a Greek God.  Again, more hyperbole. But damn it, where were you in my youth?! I needed you so much then!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, great product.  It isn&#x27;t so much getting five stars for rugged heftiness (I&#x27;m still a little biased toward heavy tools) but for function, adaptability, and sheer genius. Stop wearing the wool sweater year round. I didn&#x27;t know that your shirt tickles your back when there&#x27;s no hair there.  It&#x27;s like gentle fingers massaging you all day long.  Buy this product.</li>
            <li> This thing is a champ well made and works well.</li>
            <li> Finally somebody figured out a way for us hairy guys to look trimmed without reinventing the wheel !  Or did they reinvent the wheel?!?! lol</li>
            <li> Technology has made it easy for the single man to manscape his back.  I am very happy with the way this works, like the look and highly recommend it, it makes a difficult job very easy.  The instruction say that the initial charge should be 16 hours, my green light kicked on after about 3, however I let it go for 16 as instructed. Two thumbs up guys!</li>
            <li> The Mangroomer works exactly as advertised! It feels sturdy and solid in hand - no regrets purchasing this product! :)</li>
            <li> Works really well -close shave . My husband was able to shave his own back and only missed a few spots.</li>
            <li> This is a very useful trimmer and I would have rated it with 5 stars if only the heavy trimmer had a beveled edge so it didn&#x27;t scratch my skin.  Other than that, this is a great product.</li>
            <li> This thing is a life saver, now I can clean up without having to ask for help. Anyone that has unwanted hair knows what a pain it is to have to get assistance with this problem. Charge last more than long enough and the device gets me smooth, no stubbles. Great design and production in this one.</li>
            <li> Excellent. Ergonomic. Powerful. Highly recommend</li>
            <li> Wow it works great and no sasquatch in the neighborhood anymore. keeps a charge long and lasts thru a full haircut. no issues.</li>
            <li> This thing works incredibly well. Came charged, and out of curiosity I gave it a swipe as soon as I got it out of the box. It worked so well that had I not stopped and spent 10 minutes finishing the job, the hairless stripe diagonally across my back would have looked incredibly silly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It takes a minute or two to get the hang of it, but once you do it&#x27;s smooth sailing. The second head minimizes stubble, if you take your time with it it shaves way closer than I initially thought it would. Extendable handle is nice to have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My one tiny nitpick is that I might have liked a case/bag for everything. But that&#x27;s so minor when it works as well as it does.</li>
            <li> Pulls hair and gouges</li>
            <li> Nice, long, adjustable handle. Heads swivel in all directions as advertised and both cut very well as per my expectations.</li>
            <li> Works great!!! Shave my nuts too!!!</li>
            <li> This is one of the greatest devices I have ever purchased.  For the first time in my adult life, I have no more unwanted back hair.  My back is completly smooth, and the device is very easy to operate.  Read all the instructions first, and you, too, will have a smooth back free of hair.</li>
            <li> There are not enough positive  comments I can say about this device! It is quick and simple to use and keeps unwanted back and shoulder hair almost invisible. I use it once a month, just to maintain my bare skin. Although I have received both electrolysis and laser hair removal in the past, I still have fine, but stubborn hair on my mid to lower back</li>
            <li> Works great. Holds charge well and shaves relatively smooth. Easy to reach all areas of the back and to hold.</li>
            <li> The product works very well and would recommend to anyone.  I also applaud the customer service team who sent me another complete product after I had some minor defects with a blade attachment on the first one I received in the mail.  They even expedited the shipment with 2 day shipping.</li>
            <li> I still have to contort to get all my fur, but it works well if you take your time.  Next purchase, a leaf blower for when I am done.</li>
            <li> Thanks to this magic wand I can now go out in public without scaring women and small children.  It works as described.  I haven&#x27;t quite mastered getting every section of my mid to lower back due to a shoulder injury but cleaning up enough to wear tank tops is not problem.  I was originally skeptical about the battery, but it has proven to hold a charge for quite a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are a genetic fur ball but don&#x27;t particularly enjoy the look when wearing a tank top, I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> So far I like it... .works well.</li>
            <li> Finally!  An item to help shave my back hair.  Easy to use.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical before purchasing this razor, but found it to be both effective and of decent quality. It really does get the job done and seems like it won&#x27;t break after only a few uses. Definitely recommended.</li>
            <li> The best and easiest way to take care of back hair.  The length of the handle makes it very easy to get all areas of your back.</li>
            <li> So far I don&#x27;t have one thing negative to say. It does a great job. One of the heads is a little sharp and scratched slightly. This is great for self grooming.</li>
            <li> Worked as it was intended, the rake took the heavy stuff off and the foil shaver smoothed things out. The wife can&#x27;t keep her hands off me!</li>
            <li> purchased this for my son he loved it</li>
            <li> Does what it says it does. Battery life is a little short but what&#x27;re you gonna do.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to all. It is easy to change and easily manageable. Specially back is easily reachable</li>
            <li> Used a couple times so far and it seems to do the trick. Not a close shave but pretty close.</li>
            <li> I had tried other methods in the past and they do work most times but almost all of them that work require someone else to shave/rub/wax your back. Since my wife was visiting her family, there was no one to do that for me so I started to look for a device like this. I read some reviews and this product seemed to be the best for the price you pay. So I figured I will try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is very easy to use and I can reach my back with no one else&#x27;s help required. I was able to shave my back in about 5 minutes and I am a very hairy dude.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. It works as described in the ads and specs. Surprisingly, no nicks and cuts but a clean, smooth back...</li>
            <li> I will first admit that I have always been proud of my body hair. Secondly, that pride has always been at odds with the loathing I have for the hair on my back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-The product works well, and efficiently.&lt;br /&gt;-After the first use with the attachment for longer hair, I have used the foil type attachment to get a closer shave. Everyone&#x27;s hair will grow at different rates but I have been pleased with the time it takes before I need to trim again. (Week to week and a half before it is &amp;#34;necessary&amp;#34;)&lt;br /&gt;-Battery lasts a long time. Since the initial charge (24 hours required, that&#x27;s not a typo. 24 hours!) I have yet to charge it again, that&#x27;s using the &amp;#34;boost&amp;#34; feature on my first shave. On that note I will say that I didn&#x27;t notice a huge improvement with the boost, but it didn&#x27;t detract from it either.&lt;br /&gt;-Shaving your back in the mirror takes some getting used to, and you would do yourself a favor if you use a threeway mirror or something that will not require you to look backwards so long. The first time I has to take a break because of the pain in my neck! However, subsequent shaves are quick enough that it hasn&#x27;t been an issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would, and have, recommend this product to anyone that is tired of their back hair.</li>
            <li> Works very well. This is my third one and is by far the best model I&#x27;ve had. Can&#x27;t go wrong with this brand they are well made ( I&#x27;ve had good luck anyway)&lt;br /&gt;update 6/23/15 I Have used this shaver 2 times and now its DEAD plug in charger and light turns green in a few minutes still does not work.... SO DISAPPOINTING!!!! and I am past the return period So I guess I&#x60;m out $50 &amp;#62;:{</li>
            <li> I bought this as a replacement for my boyfriend after dropping and breaking his Mangroomer. I felt so bad I upgraded him to the Mangroomer Pro which he loved so much more. My boyfriend says the Pro model has a better reach and has an extra attachment for a closer shave.</li>
            <li> After reading all the negative reviews I was worried that I had not made a good purchase, however this thing works great and is very easy to use.  I highly recommend it to anyone struggling with back hair.  My back has been covered in long thick hair since high school (a real BigFoot situation) but within 30 minutes of charging the groomer, it was all gone.  You do need to charge the device for 24 hours before your first use, and keep in mind that you need to have a good handheld mirror and a mirror in front of you to do it right.</li>
            <li> I 43 years old,Italian and I have a lot of hair on my back. I was able to shave it all off using this product, and it was quite satisfying to be able to do it alone for the first time. It was a challenge to get every inch of may back using mirrors to see what I was doing. After a lot of twisting trying to get the angle right, it took about 25 minutes to get the whole thing done. My hair is medium/thick and my skin is not especially resistant to cuts, but I really did not notice any scrapes or cuts on my back. Very happy with the product and would recommend.</li>
            <li> Cuts terribly, must go over regular arm hair multiple times. The ease of being cordless is nice though. The second attachment is worthless.</li>
            <li> I rarely review things but this thing is amazing.  I used to either take almost an hour to do this myself or ask my wife to help which she was kind enough to do but I don&#x27;t think it was ever &#x27;sexy&#x27;.  Now I can do my back myself even faster than when she used to help.  Takes no more than 10 minutes now including clean up.  This thing can carve through anything and actually gets a very close to the skin shave without having any ingrown hairs at all.  I&#x27;ve used it about 6 times now and I&#x27;m really stunned how easy this tool makes it.  It&#x27;s no longer a huge hassle which means I&#x27;m actually doing touch ups each week rather than waiting until it was getting yetti like.  I highly recommend this is you need some help removing back hair.  It&#x27;s not too great for on point edges like a neck line so make sure you still have something a little more precise for those spots.</li>
            <li> Great product for those needing to groom themselves. Pros:   Painless hair trimming   Designed to reach all area of the back   Two heads for various trimming closeness   Built-in rechargeable battery Cons:   Noisy like any other hair trimmer   Cannot replace battery</li>
            <li> Just purchased today.  Previously removing unsightly hair from my back has been a long and very frustraiting process...Not anymore.  This baby took care of my back in about ten minutes. Yes, your back is going to turn red for maybe 20 minutes tops after shaving.  Yes, you will have to go over parts twice to ensure all the hair has been removed...but how is that any different then previous experience?  I&#x27;ve seen reviews of men describing their use as &amp;#34;painful&amp;#34;... C&#x27;mon!?  Seriously!?  It works great, only wish Id have made the investment years ago.  Happy shaving fellas!</li>
            <li> What an awesome groomer!! I have the few hairs sprouting out in random spots on my back and this shaver can get to any spot on your back. I haven&#x27;t had any issues with it kicking my skin as I drag or push it to get the hairs trimmed. It also comes with the shaver attachment in case you have the gorilla back. It charges quite fast and the battery last a long time. I use it once a week and recharge it every 3-4 months.</li>
            <li> Cuts effectively, recharges quickly.</li>
            <li> This is a good item to purchase it makes shaving that nasty back hair easy and you don&#x27;t have to ask  anyone else to do it for you,</li>
            <li> I like it very much. Beats having someone put hair removal on your back. I like the reach it has and that it&#x27;s quiet.. I recommended this to my friends.</li>
            <li> Was thinking of spending $300 to $900 for laser hair removal this summer but happily came across this product that I never knew existed. Well the hardest part of getting a perfectly shaved back in under 10 minutes was getting it out of that ridiculous plastic that everything seems to be packaged in today. It comes charged and was effortless. Enjoy your smooth back.</li>
            <li> Easy to use-- works great- don&#x27;t have to bother other people (wife) to help! I highly recommend to anybody with back hair problems</li>
            <li> Love this makes my back feel so much better, don&#x27;t have pulling hair on my back, or my butt. After this I won&#x27;t be able to live without one. It makes nicely just a little red marks for few minutes from the metal edge they go away quickly</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t purchase this from Amazon, but I have always looked for a back shaver. This one is amazing, no hassle and much time and my whole back was smooth and clean, I have only used the trimmer not the other attachment, but as a life long back shaver I am very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I am very impressed with this product.  The quality of the item is superior.  Charging does take a while, but the charge lasts about 45 minutes.  The folding handle is excellent at allowing you to reach those hard to get at areas.  My skin is left smooth and hairless after using the shaver.</li>
            <li> This is a great grooming tool, reaches everywhere needed. Having the choice to use plugged in or battery powered is nice.</li>
            <li> The wife no longer has to help me take care of that unsightly back hair.  Product works great and can reach the most stubborn places.</li>
            <li> I have searched high and low and purchased many diff models. This by far is the best to shave your back!</li>
            <li> Look no further if you need a DIY answer to the removal of back hair.  I was sceptic all but willing to give it a try.  It makes quick work of that Sasquatch hair on your back and chest and anywhere else you wish to use it.  I like the idea of dealing with it myself and consider it money well spent.  I have used it twice and charged once, so battery life seems good, and it&#x27;s still going strong.  I&#x27;m also pleased with the quality of build, I expect to get a good bit of use out of it and will buy another if needed.</li>
            <li> I owned the &amp;#34;original&amp;#34; version of this which was lackluster at best (see my review).  This version is much improved and worth every penny!  It is well constructed, and works great.  I found I needed to use the Turbo mode for best results.  The shock absorber and floating heads work great and I was able to make quick work of problem areas.  The handle has a nice non-slip coating also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I charged this once upon receipt and used it for about 30 minutes on Turbo without any noticeable loss of power.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you, like me, owned the previous version and have hesitation about purchasing this one... it&#x27;s time to give ManGroomer another chance.  I am very pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> would definitely recommend this to anyone ... there&#x27;s a good youtube review that helped.  Happy that I bought it.  thanks</li>
            <li> Works great! The new attachment gives the skin a smooth finish. So much better than the old model. Definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li> Very good, on time and an excellent product</li>
            <li> Great gift for the man with a hairy back!!! Best gift I ever got for my boyfriend and for myself since I no longer have to shave his back. A must buy for those cant reach spots</li>
            <li> I have te old version of this and it finally had enough! so I bought this one...it works great it blows my old one away!</li>
            <li> Finally, a TRUE back shaver! The size of this shaver makes it easy for even the least agile person to reach every area of the back. The adjustable angle &amp; length allow you to keep the blade in full contact with the area being shaved. Each blade head has a spring joint which enhances flexibility and helps for a comfortable shave. The foil head, although not as close as a razor blade, gives a relatively smooth finish. It also has cutters on each side which are supposed to catch stray hairs missed by the main cutter. This is a nice feature but I wish there was an attachment without them. The shaver&#x27;s angle is adjusted by a ratcheting mechanism. This takes a little effort to move and feels like something will break in the process but has been durable so far. The  push button to lock the angle is hardly necessary and you could damage the ratcheting joint if you try to adjust the angle without unlocking it first. This shaver will not operate while the charger is plugged in (an annoying feature of all shavers of this type) but most people should be able to complete their shave long before the battery runs low.</li>
            <li> Was disappointed in this item.  It is bulky and difficult to handle.  I found no difference in this shaver than any other shaver that I&#x27;ve had.  I was looking for more of a personal shaver that also had a great cut.  This wasn&#x27;t it.</li>
            <li> Just received and used this today and it is AWESOME.  Even if you don&#x27;t have a flexible upper body, you should be able to get every spot on your back with absolute ease. Back hair sucks, but this makes it so easy to get rid of.  Also don&#x27;t let the name of this item fool you.. this is a high quality item that you can use to trim or shave hair on any part of your body, most definitely not just your back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only things I noticed that could be improved:&lt;br /&gt;-It doesn&#x27;t angle out to 180 degrees.. this isn&#x27;t really a big deal at all, but since you can lock it into any angle you want, I don&#x27;t necessarily understand why they designed it to not be adjusted to a completely straight position.&lt;br /&gt;-The handle that extends out is just a bit wobbly, once again a very very tiny issue and definitely not a deal breaker for this item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Those are the only 2 things I&#x27;ve noticed that aren&#x27;t &#x27;perfect&#x27;, but they definitely shouldn&#x27;t change your mind about getting this item.</li>
            <li> I took me a long time to decide how I could remove my back hair. If you could have seen me try to do it with a standard cheap straight edge razor blade, you would have gotten a good laugh. I even laughed at my contortions to try and reach all areas of my back. I never cut myself, but I did leave a lot of redness...lol.  Anyway I took the plunge and bought the Mangroomer. I am super pleased that I did as in only a few minutes I solved my problem. I started as directed with the &amp;#34;longer&amp;#34; hair attachment and then did the fine tuning with the second attachment. As long as I keep up with it, I probably will only need to use the close shave (ie fine tune)&lt;br /&gt;attachment to keep my back in good shape....it can&#x27;t feel or see any hair or stubble on my back. There are other methods out there for one to consider as I did, but I could not be more happier with the Mangroomer.</li>
            <li> This is amazing and works great to remove hair on your back. I recommend it.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery and good product</li>
            <li> I was considering doing the same thing that other&#x27;s had tried, like taping a beard trimmer to a stick.  I&#x27;m so glad that I found this before trying something like that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s nice to be able to handle something by myself which previously required help from my wife.  I can&#x27;t imagine what unmarried guys have to go through without any help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the initial overnight charge, I was able to mow my entire back and upper arms with no noticeable loss of power.  It&#x27;s awesome.  For the price, I don&#x27;t think it would even be worth messing around with cheaper models or other brands.  Just buy this.  You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> It does a great job! In 10 minutes my back was hairless and there were no scratches on my back afterward. Now I just use it about once a week to maintain things. It&#x27;s so easy. Wish I&#x27;d had it years ago.</li>
            <li> I loved this product! Major manufacturer flaw causes the heads to break quickly!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got this product a while back.  My back hair is something that needs to be maintained on my end.  The problem is that once the heads that attach to this unit open they are basically useless.  I usually drop all my shaver product&#x27;s heads in alcohol to clean between usage.  The problem with this one is that once the head opens and the spring pops out it is almost impossible to get back into place without breaking the tiny plastic lip that holds the spring.  When I called customer service about this product they gave me the run around then said they were a third party that handles customer service and for any issues with product to email them using the email listed on the website.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After doing this several times, I was basically told to buy the replacement head on the website for $20 (basically half of what I paid for unit).  NO THANKS!  I am going to try a different product.  Do yourself a favor.. look elsewhere!</li>
            <li> Great back shaver.Easy to use.Still dont know about lifetime of the battery.</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied. Great product!!</li>
            <li> Great quality.  this is my third one over the years and they keep getting better.</li>
            <li> This thing is pretty amazing, and makes keeping brush free as pleasant as it possible can, which is not very pleasant after all.</li>
            <li> Works great - fast and efficient. EXCELLENT quality and even comes with all the gadgets needed. Thanks for this product.</li>
            <li> I am a bit of a Neanderthal ... But I used this on my back and chest and now look like a normal human being. Easy to use, no itchiness afterwards, and it gets so close you almost look like you shaved with a razor blade.</li>
            <li> I really loved this product! I would give it a 10 if I could it exactly what it&#x27;s made to do, let just day that I did a lot of research on this product and found some negative comments about it I have to disagree with everyone of them, please follow the instruction in how to charge the equipment and get to work. I&#x27;m extremely hairy man and it did the job well done. Thank you!</li>
            <li> I have tried using it 3 times now. I hate this thing. Its big, heavy, and awkward. The head is at the wrong angle to work well. It leaves the hair over 1/8&amp;#34; long. Scratches the heck out of my back. Very sharp corners. Horrible. Do not bother with it. Waste of time and money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got the Norelco Bodygroom Pro. It works great. I love it.</li>
            <li> This is the one! My first go with Mangroomer got off to a bad start when it broke, but they replaced it as soon as they found out and I have happily used it for 5 years. The only problem I had was I would forget to buy batteries when I needed them, since my old one is 5 years old I decided to upgrade to the ultimate pro. What an improvement, with the old one even after my back got used to the shave it would get irritated in some areas and I would have to give it a day or so to clear up, so far not so with the new heads, and with the foils attachment its quick to touch up. And now you can lock the handle in different possessions.&lt;br /&gt;Really guys, (and galls, to be fair) shed the sweaters, if you have been spending hundreds you need to give this a go,</li>
            <li> Surprisingly good product that does exactly what it says with little fuss or trouble. Well made. I am very pleased with it. I have recommended to several of my friends.</li>
            <li> t sstopped working after first use. Does not charge after first use.</li>
            <li> Happy with the purchase. Just used it the second time today and well worth the money. Highly recommend</li>
            <li> This is the best back shaver I have ever owned. No more taping my beard trimmer to a wooden back scratcher, to reach and shave my back. Excellent design.</li>
            <li> Best product out there to remove back hair, hands down, it is easy to use, amazing results !!!</li>
            <li> This is a great product, I have had about a week and use it about every other day. Product feels durable without weighing too much. so far I have only charged it once over night and shows no signs of slowing down. Cant speak for long term use but I expect this product will last with no problems.</li>
            <li> Good stuff.  Works great</li>
            <li> This thing is a life changer. If you&#x27;ve got a hairy back, you know what I mean.</li>
            <li> Really useful product.  I wish I had gotten this years ago.  When there&#x27;s more hair growing on your body than your head, you need something like this.  I haven&#x27;t used the fine trimmer yet, but even the &amp;#34;coarse&amp;#34; trimmer has been great for taking off the bulk of back hair.  It just takes some getting used to to use the mirror and see what you&#x27;re doing.  Definitely recommended for the man with this issue.</li>
            <li> Really excellent.  Gets the job done effortlessly - very pleased.</li>
            <li> Works great, I can finally shave my back myself.</li>
            <li> I absolutely hate back hair, but I equally hate asking my wife to help me with it, just so embarrassing. So what happens is that I don&#x27;t ask, and then it&#x27;s out of control and then finally have to ask, and it&#x27;s more embarrassing. I finally decided to take the grooming into my own hands and have not been this happy with a purchase in a long time. Not only did the groomer allow me to get every bit of hair off my back, the additional piece (for close shave) is amazing -- my back is super smooth. Love this product.</li>
            <li> It was originally given as a gag gift several years ago.  However, the recipient actually loved it and wanted another one when he broke the first one.</li>
            <li> This works very well and is easy to use.</li>
            <li> I defintely have some back hair and this really takes care of it. i was very skeptical until a friend told me about it. WOW. You may have some red scratch marks that disappear within the hour but well worth it.</li>
            <li> Too heavy, too noisy!</li>
            <li> great product! There was a little learning curve to get coordinated, working with a mirror to see my back side.</li>
            <li> I used this for the first time today and though it shaved the hair off fine it did a tad bit more. About a half hour after using the thr base trimmer head I started to feel a pain irritation on my back. I figured it was just normal chaffing. Another half and hour and it was noticeable painful so I checked myself out in the mirror. I had tons of cuts and scraps all over my back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I ever use this again it won&#x27;t be with the base blade. i&#x27;ll attach the removable one and see what that does. I would not consider myself a sensitive skinned person either.</li>
            <li> When i bought this shaver I didn&#x27;t expect much even though it received good reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very sensitive skin and I&#x27;ve previously tried shaving my back and chest as well as getting them waxed but I broke out in a big rash every time. It didn&#x27;t matter what product I put on after, to help sooth the very red and burning skin. The rash that followed was just too sore and painful to try and keep the forest on my chest and back tidy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I took a punt on this shaver and really didn&#x27;t expect much to be honest but i thought i had nothing to lose by trying it.&lt;br /&gt;I used it today for my back and chest but made a point of taking my time and not digging the shaver head into my skin.&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t say that it was very easy to do my back but It wasn&#x27;t very difficult either.&lt;br /&gt;The results though were outstanding, absolutely no cuts, red lines and more importantly, no rash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only drawback I found (it has nothing to do with the shaver), is the forest on my chest and stomach were masking my very pudgy belly which is now reminding me that the holidays are over by a few months so I&#x27;d better stop eating cakes etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easter is only around the corner so I&#x27;ll have a few Easter eggs before I start the diet, ha.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s perfect. It took 5 minutes to do the job, less than an hour to charge, and it feels sturdy. Didn&#x27;t cut me up, got a very close shave, and pretty much does everything it&#x27;s supposed to do. It&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
            <li> This is sturdy, with a very strong motor.  I&#x27;m a bit round and had no problem reaching all of my spots.  Of course I had to go look in the mirror to double check I got everything, but that&#x27;s not the machines fault.  The battery stayed strong throughout and the reach was fine.  The extension wand and elbow joint are a bit stiff, but nothing us hairy guys can&#x27;t manage.</li>
            <li> Great investment. Worked perfectly, just as advertised.  I recommend 100%.</li>
            <li> The man groomer is back, and this second generation has a lot of upgrades. Since I only use this on my back every month or so, the charge will last for a long time. The locking mechanism at the pivot point seems to be pointless, because when it is locked or unlocked it is very hard to move. The grip has a nice extension so you can virtually get any hard to reach part of your body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all I am very please with this second iteration of the man groomer. It is very well built, and I think it will last me a long time.</li>
            <li> I have some unsightly hairs on my back, the back of my neck, and on my ear lobes.  I looked into laser hair removal, but it was cost prohibitive.  Instead, I had been trying to reach around with conventional razors to shave the hair off.  That wasn&#x27;t working for me.  There are some spaces that you just can&#x27;t reach.  Enter the Mangroomer.  This thing is easy to charge and the angles are easy to adjust.  Most importantly, it&#x27;s easy to reach any of those places that are normally tough to get to.  Every morning I shave my ear lobes and the back of my neck with the MG.  If I have time, I shave my upper and lower back, the places where I have unwanted hair.  I also used this to shave my belly and chest.  It worked well.  The shaves are comfortable.  At this point I don&#x27;t feel any need to save up money to get laser hair removal.  I can easily keep my back, my ears, and the back of my neck clean shaven.</li>
            <li> Great product, worth every penny.&lt;br /&gt;It took me less than 20 min to shave my legs and full upper body. I have a 200 USD Phillips and 150 USD from Phillips and with both it took me longer than an hour. I think that&#x27;s says it all.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t trim as well as I expected. Blade is cheaply made.</li>
            <li> All I can say about this shaver is Wow! This is not my first Mangroomer, I had the original silver AA battery version for at least 5 years and it has done a great job, only changed the blades once. Unfortunately (or fortunately in this case) I dropped it and broke the tab that held the blades in so I had to purchase a new one. I was just about to order the same model I had due to its years of service until I saw this Ultimate Pro version. I dont really care for some rechargeable things like this but the Flex heads sold me on it. I received it today and took it out for a quick test, i know you are suppose to charge it first but I made it quick. I tested the regular single blade head on a small spot on my arm and it made quick work of the hair as usual. I then decided to give the dual blade/foil head a try on my stomach where I had some short stubble from trimming a few days ago. This is where the ultimate with changeable heads shines, the foil head had no problem with the stubble (a little long then the single blade head would leave) and left my stomach very smooth. I cant say its old school razor blade smooth but it is VERY close without the mess. The unit is on the charger as we speak and I will put it to use on that unsightly back hair later. The power burst button actually does help power through the long stuff which could be needed so that is a plus. I also like how the arm locks at any angle, which the previous models didn&#x27;t and would move during use. On a side note, if this is your first unit there is a learning curve to get the technique right but after that it only takes minutes.</li>
            <li> Great product! I was suprice frim the quality and the fast shipment.</li>
            <li> Good product for a last resort. Can cut you up if you don&#x27;t do it perfectly.</li>
            <li> Works great reaches where you need it .</li>
            <li> Amazingly easy to use and effective. Wonderful for the back, but also great for whole body. If you are, like me, a big furry fellow, you really owe it to yourself to try this thing. Makes quick and painless work of what was once an arduous task.</li>
            <li> I have tried everything to removed hair from my back.  I hate the way it looks.  I&#x27;ve tried having it waxed but that&#x27;s expensive and honestly embarrassing.  I tried shaving it myself but you have to be a contortionist to get the job done!  I bought this product about a month ago and it is AMAZING!  I do maintenance now only about once a week and my back has never looked better.  I strongly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Works fantastic. Such an improvement over early model. Recommend it to anyone</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying I am a hairy man.  I bought this knowing I would give it a tough workout.  I was a little hesitant at first, but after trying it on my shoulder and not having it catch once, I jumped right in and started on my back.  I was not disappointed!  The hair fell away like melting butter.  Not a single catch, not a single scratch, not a single drop of blood.  My personal technique was to stand with my back to one mirror holding a second in my hand so I could see my back in it. It did take a few minutes of getting used to seeing things in reverse but once I made the adjustment everything was fine.  Just remember, go slow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was the first time I had used a product like this and there was no redness, no sensitivity, no nothing... except smooth skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great buy.</li>
            <li> This shaver is a great alternative to regular electric clippers. It does cover the back area ok, but is not all that easy to keep the clippers angled properly for the hard to reach small area of the back. I was able to do it, but it wasn&#x27;t very easy. Still, the clippers do work well.&lt;br /&gt;******UPDATE******&lt;br /&gt;This shaver failed after about 1 year of light use. The clippers became dull very fast.&lt;br /&gt;The attachment heads became loose and fell off while using, and the battery is dead.&lt;br /&gt;Very disappointed in what I initially thought was a decent product.</li>
            <li> Very good product.My boyfriend loves it.</li>
            <li> Definitely better than the original. My hair is thick and coarse and the trimmer cut through it great. It takes a bit of maneuvering to use it, so if you have limited mobility this is not for you.  If you value your skin, do not use the shaver head attachment ( the tip that looks like an electric shaver that one would use on their face), it will tear your skin up! I only use the trimmer head, then I use the Razorba for a close shave.</li>
            <li> Had the original and this thing is a far superior product. The new foil head attachment and the flexibility in both heads really help it give you a closer shave. This is as close as you can get to smooth and hair free without the razor and lastly it charges waaaay faster than the first models. Control your yeti and get this!!!!</li>
            <li> This shaver is great. It does exactly what it&#x27;s meant for. It makes reaching your back super easy. It does a great job of getting Rid of all the hair. I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and working without problems so far.</li>
            <li> This seems to be a considerable improvement over the original in terms of overall quality of design, functionality, and quality.  The &amp;#34;extra head&amp;#34;, which is a foil with regular cutter blades on either side is probably more comfortable than the standard cutter head for most guys, though it is not as wide as the regular cutter, it does cut quite closely.  This product is easily worth the $50 sale price, at least so far - battery durability is an unknown factor at this point, although they seem to have plenty of power for my needs... no worries about running out of power if charged to begin with.  They say in the instructions to &amp;#34;drain&amp;#34; them periodically, so they don&#x27;t develop &amp;#34;memory&amp;#34; issues.  Time will tell...</li>
            <li> After following the initial charging procedure I put the pro back shaver through its paces.  The coarse blade worked fine without any pulling or pinching and the fine shaver cleaned up the remaining stubble well.  The clicking and slight resistance encountered while adjusting the handle&#x27;s angle and length is a bit scary but all works well.  So far I am quite pleased with the results I am receiving.</li>
            <li> I have patches of hair on my back that I can&#x27;t reach with anything but this.  It works great.  It takes a little bit to get used to using it, but it works great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not loud, and it works as described in the companies material.  Excellent product.</li>
            <li> Best groomer I&#x27;ve ever had...! Easy to use...nice to travel with...durable battery...overall a great product for men...give it a try!</li>
            <li> My back is COMPLEATLY covered in hair. Just as much as my chest. and Its thick too. It took a while to get it all. If you have thick hair you have to take little bits at a time. You cant just plow through or it boggs down. But what else is on the market? This is it. I thought about making my own. Taping a nice pair of hair clippers to the end of a stick. I dread having to do it again. Its still a little awkward to reach everywhere even with the long bent handle. But its still better than trying to do it with regular clippers.</li>
            <li> just right.....wish i had it sooner.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been uncomfortable about my back hair.  6 years ago on The Howard Stern Show I heard about the Mangroomer and decided to give it a try.  That being said I&#x27;m not a person who just buys anything I hear about.  I usually do my research and make informed decisions.  Ever since then, I&#x27;ve been happy with the results of this back shaver.  It not only does what the product is intended for, it does it extremely well.  Now 6 years later I dropped my shaver by accident and it broke into little pieces.  That being said, it was time to replace it so here I am upgrading to the Ultimate Pro Back Shaver.  Once again I couldn&#x27;t be happier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If your trying to decide on a shaver that can reach every part of your back this is the one for you.  If you want a shaver that can last the Mangroomer Back Shaver fits that criteria.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, told girlfriend that I had my back shaved at a message parlor by a Gehia girl, since she refused to do so, so many times. got jealous and angry. But after I showed her what did it, she now does not refuse to help out specially if I do it myself and I miss a spot or two. Killed two birds with one stone.&lt;br /&gt;However after you use the main head for the deep jungle you will hardly get to use that head again unless you let the hair grow out again. I am now using the foil head and touch it up every so often.</li>
            <li> So easy to use and works wonders!</li>
            <li> This really does work quite well.  Bought it yesterday and have used once. I imagine I will get better with it as I become more familiar with it (getting used to using the mirror and things being opposite of what you think in the mirror). Even with that said, I feel it provided good results for a first time use. Had not trimmed hair for over a month so there was enough to hair to present what I would consider full growth on me (not super dense growth but enough to be self-conscious about).  This trimmer had no trouble with it.  The adjustable handle makes this trimmer very useful and the two heads is nice although I do not see me using the regular trimmer head much since the foil head will be used to keep growth under control.  If you are looking for a way to trim your back hair with our having to throw out your shoulders, this is one to consider.  Full price is less than a one-time waxing where I live so I felt it was worth trying it out, I am glad I did.</li>
            <li> I love this thing. I can easily reach every area of my back and I can get a close buss anywhere else without any irritation.</li>
            <li> This was a Christmas gift and just what was needed.</li>
            <li> I love my Mangroomer!!!!! I can finally reach down my back without the awkwardness of bending my elbow, straining it. It cuts good as well as the shaver part is good. and the screen is lasting longer than any I have had in the past. I plan on taking care of this to keep for quite some time and I believe it will last.</li>
            <li> This is a great product!  After years of having to wait for my wife to do my back (which she hates),  this product has saved the day.  I&#x27;m 6&amp;#34;8 so there is a lot of back to go over and my hair is not thick, but gets long after a month of not shaving.  I can reach every spot on my back with NO cuts or scraping or marks!  I had my wife check my back after the 1st time I did it myself and she was astounded that she could not find any patches or stray hairs ANYWHERE!!!  LOVE THE MANGROOME ULTIMATE!!</li>
            <li> Exactly as described makes the perfect gift for my 86 year old grandmother. I never know what to buy her for Christmas so she usually gets a box of old cereal. Now she can trim all that unsightly back hair. Ever since the menopause she is covered in it.  Thank the lord for Amazon.</li>
            <li> Great product!!!!  Works perfectly!  Worth every penny and saves from costly hair removal treatments.</li>
            <li> this is one of the best things i own i can finally get my poor sister to stop shaving my back changed my life, as a hairy guy i feel more confident being able to take my shirt off now</li>
            <li> very good, easy to use and as advertised. No problem so far with it.</li>
            <li> I have a hairy back. Let&#x27;s just establish that. I&#x27;m 52 and have struggled with this since it grew in when I was in my early 20&#x27;s. In any event, I&#x27;ve tired everything over the years... I&#x27;ve had waxing done every six weeks, I did many rounds of laser hair removal (I have tattoos so they can&#x27;t get to that hair), I tried running a razor over my back every other day (painful, stings, cuts and threw out my shoulder trying to reach), I tried electric razors (no reach and burned the crap out of my skin)... Nothing was easy, nothing worked well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought their lower end model when it first came out. It was just ok. So, here I am stuck with no solution. I don&#x27;t want to do waxing anymore as it is expensive, long and painful. I tried a &amp;#34;manscaper&amp;#34; in SF. That was a weird experience as he did back, sack and crack... I! WILL! NEVER! DO! THAT! AGAIN!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, his tools were the right ones for the job so I tried to find some online. That brought me to the Mangroomer Ultimate Pro... It is the best and final solution to your back hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Forget the regular head. The teeth are too coarse and it won&#x27;t give you a fine shave. It would be great for the initial pass, especially if you look like King Kong. The best tool is the double sided fine clipper with the shaver head. You have to draw it slowly across your skin or it will pull the hair. however, the first pass cuts it down almost smooth. Then, re-angling the arm you pass back over with the &amp;#34;foil&amp;#34; part. That gets the fine stubble down to almost smooth skin. The entire process... 8 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The articulating arm with the extension allows for all angles so you can use the teeth and then the foil. Know this though, it is NOT fine enough for the &amp;#34;sack&amp;#34; or the &amp;#34;taint&amp;#34; but it is fine for the &amp;#34;crack&amp;#34; (and the rest) if you stretch the skin. If you are one of those guys that likes to take ALL the hair down (arms, legs, ass, etc..) then this is a great solution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Downside... it takes a while to get a full charge but the charge lasts a while. Also, REMEMBER TO MOVE SLOWLY ACROSS YOUR BACK OR YOU&#x27;LL PULL HAIRS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Guys, take it from me, this is the answer to every hairy man&#x27;s prayers.</li>
            <li> I have only used it a couple times and went to charge it and it will not turn on anymore. Charged all night and the light is green but no longer works. Very disappointed since it&#x27;s pretty much brand-new still. Based on another review I saw it doesn&#x27;t seem worth my time to contact anyone because they only can help if you&#x27;re buying something and you&#x27;re not able to support you with your previous purchase</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Mangroomer for several weeks to shave the hair on my back, front, legs and arms. On my first shave, I used the wide blade to remove long hair (I expect I&#x27;ll use that blade rarely from now on). For subsequent periodic shaves, I use the foil blade to remove short hair. The foil blade is especially effective and is the best solution I&#x27;ve ever had for removing my body hair - it usually cuts the hair in one or two passes. I needed the &amp;#34;Power Burst&amp;#34; feature only during the first shave. The long and flexible handle makes it easy to reach every spot on my body. I&#x27;ve not had any problems with scratching or cutting from either blade. After each use, I charge it overnight and it&#x27;s ready to go by the next morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t think of anything negative to say about the Mangroomer. Great product!</li>
            <li> Great tool for shaving the back and neck area.  Little loud but other than that, worked like a charm!!  Buy it!</li>
            <li> Fabulous. Just fabulous. Goodbye baboon-like back. Baboon is smooth now. Very good for scratching also. Relaxing. Never marry again. Strongly recommended to be a part of your  new life style along with beard trimmer.</li>
            <li> I have used this a couple times now and really like it. Makes the whole &amp;#34;hard to reach&amp;#34; thing a past problem.</li>
            <li> This product is awesome!  I was able to reach all the contours of my back with ease.  The shave is very close, which was one of my concerns.  I also use this product on my legs, arms and chest.  I used to use a beard trimmer before, but with the Mangroomer Pro I shaved off 10 - 15 mins of grooming time (pun intended).  I still use the beard trimmer on my armpits and genitals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Construction is of high quality so I definitely recommend to any guy wanting to groom their body.</li>
            <li> Excellent shaver for woolly mammoth like covering. No complaints so far.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and works great.&lt;br /&gt;You do need to go over the area a few times.&lt;br /&gt;The adjust-ability of the device is awesome.&lt;br /&gt;Wireless makes things easier.&lt;br /&gt;Rechargeable rather than batteries is a plus&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall happy with the purchase</li>
            <li> I was surprised just how big and clunky this thing is. The size makes it cumbersome to operate. In the end it was a waste of money and I&#x27;ll go back to using a cheap disposable razor and a little flexibility.</li>
            <li> good quality.  prompt delivery.  good product for the money....does the job nicely</li>
            <li> This product works very well. I wish I had bought before !</li>
            <li> Strong, reliable, long battery life. Works Exactly as stated. Two heads. easy to use and convenient. Heads change easily and has a locking switch for removing them. Longer than I&#x27;d expected to reach is no issue. Its a well made product. Would recommend, You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> If you need to reach those hard to reach places on your back this is the shaver for you.  It comes with two heads, one is the clipper and the other is similar to an electric razor.  The electric razor does not work well due to the small clipper like ridges on each side of the head.  So I use a regular electric shaver to finish the job.</li>
            <li> Works great everywhere. No more patchy spots of hair on my back. This covers all angles.</li>
            <li> Works fine and is a great idea.. A bit pricey but it is a one function item. I would say it it is a problem solver for sure</li>
            <li> The main cutting blade does get caught up sometimes but maybe it&#x27;s me.  Overall, it does it&#x27;s job and I&#x27;m happy I have it.  I would recommend the product.</li>
            <li> Much better than my last Mangroomer.  Power boost works great.  I like the switchable shaving attachments.  Just hope this one doesn&#x27;t start to have same problem as my last one.  It would shut off and I would have to hit it to turn back on</li>
            <li> Awesome! I will be brief: 1. My wife does not need to be bother to shave my back anymore, 2. it shaves very close, so it works, 3. it takes only 10-15 min to get the job done.</li>
            <li> Extremely useful and easy to use. I am 6&#x27;2&amp;#34; tall, of italian ancestry and I&#x27;m 220 pounds. First product I&#x27;ve found where I can reach every part of my back without irritating my skin and the build quality is pretty good.</li>
            <li> This is worth the extra money when compared to the previous two mangroomer versions. It trims very close to the skin, but not too close as to cause ingrown hairs and such that I experienced from using other body trimmers like the one Norelco makes. This thing is well-built and goes a long ways on a full charge. I can trim my entire upper body (chest, shoulders, back) and pubic area and the groomer seems to have enough power left to probably do my entire lower body as well. When it comes to manscaping, this is your ticket.</li>
            <li> A little bit noisy. Great reach. Heavy duty body. Overall gets the job done.</li>
            <li> Amazing tool. Saves so much time and embarrassment. Best product yet!</li>
            <li> Best product at what it does. However No Support!  I have tried to get support response from the manufacturer at least 5 times 3 different ways  They do not respond  I have had 2 of the previous models and the inaccessible batteries failed to hold a charge after a year.  The new ultimate is a vastly better product. However the instructions tell you how to remove and dispose of the batteries, nothing is mentioned about replacement of the batteries.  I have tried to contact the company for support  The Phone support number connects you to people who sell but they are not able to answer tech questions or escalate.  I was trying to find out about changing the batteries and a charging protocol to extend the life of the batteries.  I would have given a 5 star review if they had responded to my multiple requests  Because of this battery issue you are renting, not buying..</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only one I&#x27;ve ever found that&#x27;s fully adjustable and easy to use. And it&#x27;s powerful enough to handle the job! Would fully recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> Best unit yet for my back. Cuts clean and does&#x27;nt cut me like the old one. And the shaver attachment works wonderful to maintain.</li>
            <li> This is the best shaver ever!</li>
            <li> Works decent but don&#x27;t expect a miracle.</li>
            <li> the product works as advertised I am very pleased with its performance and would recommend it to anyone else who would like to use it.</li>
            <li> Works great. I use it every full moon and it makes me howl with delight!</li>
            <li> Awesome product. Does what it needs to do with little effort. Saves the girlfriend from having to do it which she&#x27;s thankful for.</li>
            <li> This product exceeded my expectations. It is easy to use and the cut is smooth. I think this item is a bargain.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my early forties now and have been twisting myself into Houdini-esque contortions for the last 20 years in an attempt to keep my back clear of the fur that insists on growing there. With this tool, I cleared my back of the inch long, curly black hair that I hated within minutes. It was great!</li>
            <li> It works well, but I would prefer that it offered another head with a longer guard for trimming chest hair.</li>
            <li> this is the best darn piece of equipment I own by far.  It has made my grooming quick and easy, and accurate.</li>
            <li> I got so tired and grossed out when my hubs would ask me to help him shave or Nair his back....so I bought him this, and he&#x27;s on his own! :) his back is smooth and delicious now!</li>
            <li> Well, I can&#x27;t really use it. I just received the product, its battery is dead and the power supply fo the battery charger included has a UK socket! I have to buy an adaptor for 220V sockets</li>
            <li> Owned a previous battery powered model that broke after I dropped it.  Serious upgrades from the old version at essentially the same price.</li>
            <li> I was shocked how well this thing worked. I&#x27;ve been using it for a good while now. It gets to those hard-to-reach places in the midback better than anything else I&#x27;ve used, aside from another pair of hands.</li>
            <li> Works as advertised, making it quick and easy to reach those troublesome patches of hair.</li>
            <li> Easy to use. Close cut to skin. Totally recommend if you are a body shaver.</li>
            <li> I totally recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Great for shaving back when your alone. Holds a Good charge.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just a normal guy that hates to look like a rug.  I regret this purchase b/c it&#x27;s an all or nothing shaver.  In my mind, unless you are a bodybuilder or swimmer, a guy has got to have hair.  I was hoping it would have some sort of attachment in which I can cut off all but maybe a quarter inch.  This is all or nothing.&lt;br /&gt;Shaving the back was tricky too, while back there, I thought I&#x27;d clean up the rear and ouch!  I got bit in the buttocks.&lt;br /&gt;So any guy out there that is not built that does not want to look like they left surgery, this thing will cut you bald.  If your are down wit dat, just don&#x27;t get bit in the buttocks.</li>
            <li> This has replaced my manual and electric shaver and bi weekly stops to the barber to get my neck lined cleaned up.  No pull, love that I can use this dry and in wet conditions and have the same smooth results!  It travels great too! I would recommend this to anyone!  Great product thanks Mangroomer!</li>
            <li> Read all the reviews but still wasn&#x27;t confident this thing would work, so happy I ordered it. Works great get the job done, no longer have to worry about taking my shirt off or wearing t-shirts. Love it</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  Good quality and allows you to reach every part of your back with ease.</li>
            <li> I would like my money back since its mere waste of time and money. Its better to stay away from it than got your back scratched badly.</li>
            <li> I had an earlier model of the Man Groomer and it finally wore out after several years. When I replaced it I decided to upgrade to the Ultimate Pro. It does a great job. I didn&#x27;t think the second head used to get what&#x27;s left after the initial trim, would work, but I was wrong. My back hasn&#x27;t looked this hairless or felt this smooth in a really long time.</li>
            <li> Excellent groomer that works very well.</li>
            <li> I had the original one that was battery operated and finally died.  I get my back waxed when I am back in the states.  No place to do that where I am at.  Like that I can switch out the head for a closer shave.  Very happy how well it does.  Really happy that it is now rechargeable.</li>
            <li> Works great, but needs a little better battery life.</li>
            <li> Product works great but there&#x27;s a bit of a learning curve.  Luckily the awkwardness goes away as you get more familiar with it.</li>
            <li> My husband loves it!  Best Christmas gift I could have given him. Saw it demonstrated on Rachael Ray and thought this is it!</li>
            <li> Fantastic product. Does what its supposed to do and has a premium feel to it. Love it!!</li>
            <li> My boy friend loves this product.. Works great..</li>
            <li> Outstanding!!! If you need to take hair off your back and have to do it yourself, this works great.</li>
            <li> I used this product maybe 4 times and it quit working.  I would not buy this again!</li>
            <li> Finally found a product that actually allows me to trim the back hair myself. ALL the back hair....it&#x27;s so easy and adjusts so well you can reach your entire back. I have a hand held mirror that I hold in one hand and the trimmer in the other while looking at my back in the big mirror. Simply start on one side and slowly move across.....like mowing the yard. Takes about 15 minutes total. I wish I&#x27;d found this product 20 years ago.</li>
            <li> This is the best thing I&#x27;ve found to de-fuzz my back.  I think it could be better but it&#x27;s the best thing I&#x27;ve found so far.</li>
            <li> This is a really nice step up from the original Mangroomer. The hinges feel more solid, the unit is more powerful, and the close shave attachment is very nice. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Even though it has rechargeable battery, the power level fluctuates and it does not&lt;br /&gt;cut hair too well. The blades seem to be dull</li>
            <li> Razor works very well and reaches all problem spots.</li>
            <li> Timely and efficient and exactly what was ordered.</li>
            <li> This is a great groomer for difficult zones like the back. I can&#x27;t be happier with it. Excellent alternative if you can&#x27;t afford laser grooming or don&#x27;t want to go through the painful wax and you need to do it by yourself.</li>
            <li> Very surprised at how well this works.</li>
            <li> Works as advertised it was a good selection.</li>
            <li> Better than the original, but, still nothing close to a regular electric or hand razor. If you are not careful, you can get scratched.</li>
            <li> This is a really good trimmer. If you need this kind of product, you probably know it and you will be happy with it. I am amazed at how long the battery lasts. I generally just use the trimmer and not the shaver, so this is really a review of the trimmer. I know two other men who use this, and we all agree this is very much worth the money. It works far better than I expected.</li>
            <li> This does everything you want it to do, easily, however it has 2 pretty big flaws. 1. It is not water proof. 2. Unlike most electric razors, you can&#x27;t remove the top part to clean it out, only the bottom part, which leaves me wondering how long this will work till it clogs and I have to buy a new head for it.</li>
            <li> This product works as advertised for removing body hair, although it does leave small amount of invisible stubble that you can feel.  This is perfectly acceptable with me, I wasn&#x27;t expecting a razor or waxed level of smooth. Compared to what I was dealing with it&#x27;s a significant improvement.  The build quality is excellent, the product is well constructed of heavy gauge materials.  All adjustments and locks work well and maintain their positions.  It comes with 2 different heads, one for removing longer hair, which you&#x27;ll likely need for the first use, and a closer shaving head for maintenance.  I primarily use the latter now on a weekly basis.  The heads remove and install very easily.  After some practice I was able to manipulate the shaver to hit all the areas of my back.  The product extends and adjusts to multiple positions, it&#x27;s just a matter of finding what works for you.  I charged it once for 24 hours after I received it and it&#x27;s still working on that charge 2 months later, so battery life is good.  Overall I&#x27;m pleased with the product performance.</li>
            <li> It works perfect!!!..I like how it bends and extends to get to the hard to reach spots on my back.The hair on my back is not thick but there is enough there for me to be self contiouse about it.In the past I have had it waxed and that hurts like hell.Plus having it waxed takes time with an appointment and it cost around hundred bucks.This tool makes quick work of it in no time the hair is gone at you&#x27;re own leisure.</li>
            <li> The best man groomer since they first came out. I would not buy anything other than the ultimate pro pack.</li>
            <li> Amazing product! Is fast, efficient and gets the job done. Much less painful than waxing and pays for itself in just 1 use compared to waxing.The Mangroomer gets a remarkable close shave in a quick amount of time. It will cut through the thickest hair and the battery life is remarkable. My only complaint is that I did not purchase this product sooner.</li>
            <li> it works ok but really ruff on the back. takes a very long time to get a half done job</li>
            <li> Great idea, well executed.</li>
            <li> Wish I had this 20 years ago</li>
            <li> Very happy with this product</li>
            <li> garbage. waste of money, useless....does not stretch over the ankle, it stays in the ankle just like that product-photo above. and it cuts badly.</li>
            <li> Charged for about 20 hours initially like the instructions said.  Unit will not turn on at all.  Never got even one use out of it.  Charging indicator light shows it as fully charged but the power button does nothing.  Complete waste of money</li>
            <li> I have had to replace this product twice as it stops working within a month . The power button has a problem ,  the first one would not power off and i had to plug it into the power outlet to get it to stop . The replacement that was sent has stopped working within a month ! I&#x27;m very dissapointed with this model . I do have another Model of Mangroomer which has been working well for the last year . There is a problem with this specific model .</li>
            <li> I always have problems with the hair of my back now is al solve with this item awesome!!!!</li>
            <li> I had purchased the mangroomer twice before I finally learned my lesson.  The first purchase was made with the old model that broke after 1 year of use.  The electronic trimmer took batteries and I was frustrated that I could not use the trimmer in the shower.  I recently purchase their new Ultimate Pro with Shock Absorbing Head.  The problem is that the trimmer does the same job that the old one does but looks difference and has a flexible head.  The head absorbs but the trimmer is still the same.  Am I missing something?  In any case I thought the trimmer would certainly be different but it was hopeless wishing.  Maybe next time.</li>
            <li> Nice improvement from the original product. Both heads are very useful.</li>
            <li> I bought this to shave my back and shoulders that have thick hair to the point it looks like I&#x27;m wearing a sweater.  I used to use an electric hair cutter, which didn&#x27;t shave close and often scratched or cut me.  I just tried this Mangroomer, and was amazed.  No scratching or pulling and the different heads allow a closer shave than regular clippers.  With the extending handle, I was able to do my whole back without engaging the help of my partner, who was also impressed as a result.  I highly recommend this for any guy needing to groom hair off any part of their body.  Great product!</li>
            <li> After years of struggling to reach those points of my back with my own bare hands, and practically dislocating them. I searched for something to help me reach those points. When I typed in back shaver, many things popped up, many tools the help extended razors, that involved chemical hair removal, and offered counseling for laser removal.&lt;br /&gt;When I was at my point of giving up on this elusive miracle, I saw for the first time with my own eyes the mansgroomer ultimate pro back shaver. I was in disbelief thinking that someone finally answered my prayers; was the answer I have always been looking for finally here? I spoke to my friends and family stating that I needed this shaver.&lt;br /&gt;On Christmas my prayers was finally answered. As I opened my gift and saw that they had bought me the mansgroomer Ultrimate Pro back shaver, I immediately opened up the shaver, looked at it, went over the directions &amp; pressed the power button. right then I saw that the shaver hats power in it, I immediately ran into the bathroom, pulled off my shirt, looked into the mirror, and said here we go. The shaver went smoothly as I went up and down my back sometimes tilting it sideways to grab coarse parts, that night, not a single bit of hair was left across my back. Felt like a gentle massage.&lt;br /&gt;It takes no time &amp; little effort, very little effort to feel, in the words of the great Zohan, Silky Smooth!! If you have body hair issues, no matter what part of the body, you have to grabs this product, or any of the mansgroomer line. From a disbeliever to a true fan, thank you.</li>
            <li> works as advertised. beats the heck out of the kind that uses a disposable razor.</li>
            <li> Judging by the poor reviews the previous Mangroomers received, this one must be greatly improved because I really like it.  It trims my difficult to reach back hair nicely with the standard head, and the &amp;#34;shaver&amp;#34; head works really well at trimming it like it was done with a blade.  Seems very sturdy and well made, I like the shock absorber flex heads, and the angles/extensions make it easy to get the normally unreachable parts of the back.</li>
            <li> The new super duper model makes the old model look like a preproduction prototype. Much smoother and more efficient, easier to reach areas on my back, the rechargable feature is huge and the added rubber coatings in places makes it seem much more like a professional tool rather than a toy. I hope this one lasts longer than five years - it certainly looks and feels like it will.</li>
            <li> So, I&#x27;ve been debating purchasing something like this for eons. Even though every girl I&#x27;ve ever dated has been cool with my meager attempts at managing the back hair situation, I finally decided to take the plunge. It&#x27;s mostly a matter about feeling comfortable and confident with one&#x27;s self, and this thing does the trick. (and lets face it; 99% of us aren&#x27;t going to salons or asking a buddy to shave our backs.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, I may seriously consider scheduling my Back Maintenance days to coincide with my Clean The Bathroom days. You will make a mess. Hair will be everywhere. Just roll with it. My first 30-second impression of using it was one of concern; it didn&#x27;t seem to be taking anything off. I tried pressing down too hard, and it bit a little, making me even more nervous. (fyi; that&#x27;s the only time in the process it bit, and it was my fault. Pressed too hard in thick fur.) Eventually, I figured it out; this thing seems to work best with very little pressure against your skin while using a back and forth motion, like you&#x27;re using a back-scratcher. Once I figured that out, I was able to make fairly short work of things. The hardest part is figuring out angles of attack. It works best if you&#x27;re going against the grain of the hair. Since my screwy hair grows sideways apparently, the &amp;#34;self hug&amp;#34; method seemed most effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m pretty happy with it. It took a while, but I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll get faster with practice - I&#x27;m not good with mirror contortions. To be honest, i didn&#x27;t use the foil head at all to go super-smooth. I can&#x27;t imagine being able to use that and not end up with missed patches everywhere; by the time you need that attachment, the hair is short enough that it&#x27;s impossible to see in the mirror.</li>
            <li> Have used Mangroomer&#x27;s entry level unit (battery operated) for a few years but build quality of the hinge was poor and eventually lost it&#x27;s ability to lock in place.  Went with top of the line rechargeable this time and glad I did.  It is extremely sturdy.  I only had the cutting head with the cheaper model but this one gives you a second shaving head for extra close hair removal.  I can get every area of my back without help.  Great for the neck area between haircuts.  Great product.</li>
            <li> Powerful and cuts well but is dangerous to use in hard-to-reach spots that you can&#x27;t see because it is easy to cut yourself</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I needed.  I have a hairy back which I thought I could do nothing about because I couldn&#x27;t shave it myself and I did not want to ask a friend to shave it or get a wax or anything like that.  I stumbled across this and decided to give it a surprise and it works fantastic.  It is powerful and gets a close and comfortable shave for an electric razor.  If you have a hairy back this is the perfect solution.</li>
            <li> Could be a little closer in shave.  But, could be worse.  Probably the easiest to use.</li>
            <li> ITS OK BUT NEEDS A FEW CHANGES ON THE SHAVER HEAD THE HEAD NEEDS TO ANGLE MORE TO ME</li>
            <li> Good but i recommend looking for other options.  Not very easy to reach intended spots while keeping the blade at the correct angle.</li>
            <li> This thing does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do.  It takes a little bit to get used to using in on your back but does a very good job.  For the money can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
            <li> My husband needs my help as the long handle does not provide enough pressure on his back when he tries to use it himself.  Does not provide a close shave and need to run over the same area many times to remove all hair even when using the boost feature.</li>
            <li> Perfect for the job...</li>
            <li> I wish I bought something like this years ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My back hair has gotten worse the older I get. It&#x27;s been to the point of embarrassment at the pool/beach. I&#x27;m not talking Wookie proportions, but still pretty bad. I tried waxing. Not only did that hurt, but it was expensive, inconvenient, and caused a rash and irritation that lasted a long time. I had my wife shave it with clippers, but that isn&#x27;t exactly a turn-on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other reviewers got it right about a little bit of learning curve with this. The product works better than I thought, but it takes some practice to get the angle just right as you reach to do the job. Someone recommended using it in a similar way you would use a back scratcher rather than trying to look in the mirror and target your hairy areas. I found that advice to be worthwhile. Do a once over holding it like a back scratcher without trying to use a mirror, then try and touch up the areas that need it. It will work much better and you won&#x27;t fumble with the angle of the head of the device so much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as models go...really, you&#x27;ve made the decision to get something like this, spend the extra money and get the Ultimate. It&#x27;s made well and will last for years. Don&#x27;t look back (pun intended) a year or two from now wishing you got one with just a hair (!) more features. The foil head that comes with this model really helps maintain your work and keep things under control and smooth.</li>
            <li> This is my SECOND Mangroomer purchase.  My first lasted several years and many drops.  When I saw this model I HAD to have it.  It is AWESOME, and when I had trouble with the clipper and shaver head, I wrote to the company and they sent me an ENTIRELY brand new unit!  No questions asked.  AMAZING company service.  HIGHLY recommend this product!!!</li>
            <li> Great product, could be quieter but works well.</li>
            <li> thanks. dad asked for this.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing. Works awesomely. It does exactly as indicated, reaches all the hard to reach areas on the back to remove that unsightly hair. :)</li>
            <li> Works better than I expected.</li>
            <li> I loved the mangroomer now i can fire my daughter</li>
            <li> Works really well.  easy to use and actually removes the hair!!</li>
            <li> Sort of works.  Not real happy with it.</li>
            <li> looks great its a awesome. Make one with a Lithium battery !!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Good product. Excellent product info and use instructions.</li>
            <li> This worked great to shave my hairy back</li>
            <li> Cuts good head not wide enough for close shave attachment.</li>
            <li> Great Newer model is better.</li>
            <li> This works better then any buzzer I&#x27;ve used, super easy to reach trouble spots and doesn&#x27;t cut you at all highly recommend</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a hair beast….I make Magnum PI look like a hairless wonder and the Mangroomer really does the job.  They must have put a lot of money into the re-design of the new version and it is well worth it…the build quality is way better.  I owned the previous version and loved that as well but the new version is much better.  Bottom line, Great product, great concept and now I can take care of my back hair by myself.</li>
            <li> Tried the next cheaper version awhile back and didn&#x27;t like it. Of course, I didn&#x27;t really give it a chance because it just felt awkward.&lt;br /&gt;Decided to give this version a try and wow!&lt;br /&gt; Once I got the hang of it was fine.&lt;br /&gt;Unlike a razor there was zero irritation. It mowed the stuff down like a weedeater through peachfuzz and my hair is more like that found in a horse hair blanket than flowing silken strands.&lt;br /&gt;And it took about 1/3 the time of a razor.&lt;br /&gt;What&#x27;s not to like? Besides the cloud of stubble spread all over the bathroom, I mean.&lt;br /&gt;Maybe they could put a Dirt Devil attachment in the other end.</li>
            <li> The product works as advertised.  Easy to operate.  Battery charge more than adequate.  Flexible head is a nice feature.  Minimal abrasion.</li>
            <li> This product is my savior</li>
            <li> Takes some time to get used to but great result.</li>
            <li> I wish I didn&#x27;t need it but it works great.I hope it holds up.</li>
            <li> The battery keeps a charge forever and the handle makes everything reachable with ease.</li>
            <li> Best price online. Works great!</li>
            <li> Awesome product and easy to use. Highly recommend mangroomer</li>
            <li> Terrible product. I used it once, and now the main head no longer works. I would highly suggest to any one not to purchase this product.</li>
            <li> Solid product that works.</li>
            <li> Does exactly as advertised, easy to use and painless. I was skeptical at first and it takes a little time, but if you have been searching for convenience and affordable options, this is it</li>
            <li> Awesome convenient you won&#x27;t be disappointed in the past needed my girlfriend to trim hard to reach areas and now I do it myself</li>
            <li> Purchased this for my brother who won&#x27;t shop on line.  He said this shaver took some getting used to --- as in how to hold it for successful results --- but otherwise it worked well for him.</li>
            <li> I was very anxious about purchasing this item because the reviews were not very positive.  So far, it works fine.  It takes some practice to reach everywhere, but with the foil shaving head, the shave is very close.  It isn&#x27;t falling apart, and holds the charge well.  I just wish it were less expensive.</li>
            <li> If you like to use a back scratcher you will love this shaver.  It feels just as good as scratching your back and you remove the unwanted hair at the same time.  I use the wider but less close shaving head as it is quicker and does a very adequate job and feels very good at the same time.  I used to use liquid creme hair remover and that was smelly, a real pain and time consuming.  The Mangroomer is the way to go in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I debated giving it 4 stars because of what I think it needed to be a perfect man groomer.&lt;br /&gt;It clearly states it&#x27;s a back shaver so that said it gets 5 stars because that&#x27;s exactly what it does.&lt;br /&gt;The design is perfect. The feel is nice. It glides across your back cutting the hair away with no pulling or scratching. The foil head is a nice feature to smooth away any stubble left.&lt;br /&gt;The wide blades cover a lot of area and with some practice you will be able to get the job done without twisting yourself in awkward positions.&lt;br /&gt;It does a great job with little effort no pain.&lt;br /&gt;Haven&#x27;t found the need for the turbo boost.&lt;br /&gt;Now in a perfect world the shaver would detach from the handle and have a trim setting for adjustable length so I could use the same device to trim down my chest hair and other parts I don&#x27;t want completely off. But like I said, for what it was designed to do it does a great job.</li>
            <li> Does a pretty good job!! Easy to reach every single contour of the back!</li>
            <li> No complaints at all. Before purchase I read the reviews and figured that what most were saying was correct. This does the job. If you&#x27;re sick of being the Gorilla in the locker room, use this. The hardest part is seeing your progress if you don&#x27;t have mirrors opposite of one another. That&#x27;s all. Mow the lawn. There&#x27;s enough battery to do the front and back yard. With the bush hog and trimmer. If you&#x27;re unhappy with this, I have to figure you don&#x27;t like much of anything you buy.</li>
            <li> Finally a back groomer someone can do on their own!  It&#x27;s easy to use and requires little effort when shaving.</li>
            <li> Very good to shave the back. It might get your back a little red but you will get used to it. I totally recommend!</li>
            <li> The mangroomer ultimate pro back is awesome.  The power is strong and length of handle is good.  Manageable for people who have tight shoulders and not able to reach difficult spots on back. Love the attachment for short hairs that leaves body smooth without any irritation.  I recommend the mangroomer.</li>
            <li> Great! Very happy.  It worked incredible.  Then I shaved my dogs back hair.  He couldn&#x27;t be happier.  Thanks mandog groomer.</li>
            <li> This thing is a lifesaver for those with back hair. Super flexible shaver that can get just about anywhere on your back. Highly recommend it if you require any back grooming.</li>
            <li> MUCH more powerful than the original! Its also better built and quieter. As long as the battery lasts I will be very satisfied.</li>
            <li> Works great . so much better than the first generation model .</li>
            <li> I tried this for the first time, seems to work very well. But I find it odd that there is no case to keep it in. After using a box cutter to open the plastic thing it arrived in, I now have the shaver, spare head, charger and brush sitting on the counter. Where to keep it all between uses? Am I the only one who thinks it&#x27;s odd that there is no case to put it all in?</li>
            <li> Works Great and is worth the money, my husband says he enjoys this a lot better than other shavers he has used!</li>
            <li> the extending handle which actually locks into place makes it much better and easier to use.  The foil makes a closer shave and I like the power surge option</li>
            <li> What can I say...useful for de-hairing the hairy places.</li>
            <li> Does the job and is very efficient. Glad I purchased this.</li>
            <li> A little rough going over your back. Will leave scratch marks if using the long hair trimmer. Somewhat difficult to use stretching to the lower back. Does have good power and seems like it will last.</li>
            <li> This was a complete waste of money.  Great idea but they fell short with the swivel head (i.e., the most important part). It&#x27;s nearly impossible to keep the cutting head flat against your back!  They say that head swivels, but there&#x27;s so much resistance in the swivel that it might as well just be a solid mount.  I threw mine right in the garbage can 10 minutes after using it for the first time.  Whomever designed this swivel head with so much tension should be FIRED!  I gave the BakBlade a try next and absolutely loved it!  I look forward to using the BakBlade.  This ManGroomer is garbage!</li>
            <li> Works as i had hoped it would and very easy to ues only have use it 2 times so far so good</li>
            <li> Works as advertised. I&#x27;m happy with the quality and usability.</li>
            <li> If you have back hair and don&#x27;t want to, this is totally the way to go.  I&#x27;ve tried everything from waxing to Nair for Men to trying to just embrace the fact that I&#x27;m a furry dude and letting it go but the only thing that has consistently worked for me is the Mangroomer.  I had the Professional model for about 4 years and loved it but when it was time to replace the shaving head on it I saw this model on sale and decided to upgrade instead.  I&#x27;m glad that I did, this one has a much more solid feel to it, more power and the added option of the foil head for a closer shave where needed.  This is the only thing that I&#x27;ve found that I can use without help to reach my entire back, it&#x27;s fast and easy and a really great product.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Very effective...you have to be patient, but it will groom as well as you allow it.  The first one I got crapped out after only 2 uses, but the replacement has been working very well for the past month, and the reason I delayed my comment on this...I would recommend this to anyone that needs to remove body hair where it is unwanted.</li>
            <li> This is a recent purchase, but my boyfriend loves it! Worth paying extra for the &amp;#34;Pro&amp;#34; with the pivot head.</li>
            <li> UPDATE&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to share the battery life.  After using this about every other day (just for my back) with it on the Power Burst it lasted from Christmas to the beginning of February before I had to recharge it.  This was great battery life!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am hairy.  So freaking hairy....  With this I am no longer!!!  I have tried so many body groomers to shave my back, I use a razor for my upper arms, chest and stomach, but I can only reach the lower back with a razor.  The upper back has been a problem.  I have tried several other ones (like Phillips) and they just do not work for me.  The heads often pop off when pulling up around the shoulder blade or I cannot reach parts and go against the grain (I look like I am doing Yoga in the shower).  I got this as a Christmas present and after the first use I am amazed.  The handle and head all lock, so no popping off when the shoulder blade gets between the head and the handle, I can get a smooth stroke all over those rough terrains.  I use the head with the foil on it as that seemed to do the best job and left the back smooth!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The wide head makes it a quick job and the handle expands to any length so I can get really low and all the way to my neck.  I use it with power boost on every time and I can shave my back in under 3 minutes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After I am done you cannot see any hair, it is smooth!  In the past other shavers have left a tiny bit of hair that is noticeable when you have black hair and white skin...  This gets it all and does it quicker and easier than any other shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is not waterproof so I shave in the shower (with no water) and than put it away and than shower off and shave the rest with a razor.  The unit&#x27;s head is easy to clean and I can just rinse it under some water in the sink and it folds to a small size that I can easily put in the medicine cabinet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so happy with this and wish I had received this sooner, it is has made shaving much quicker and gives a better result.  This is a must for anyone shaving their back!!ives a better result.  This is a must for anyone shaving their back!!</li>
            <li> Great product and works awesome!</li>
            <li> One of the worst products I&#x27;ve ever purchased? And do you want to know why? The battery loses charge in like 2 days and since its USB chargeable every time you want to shave, you have to plug into a USB charger for an hour. How smart is that? It renders the device useless. This is not, by definition, an every day beard shaver. This is for body hair that most men shave once a week or once a month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only benefit thing has is the reach action. Get a Norelco body groomer instead. At least its batteries hold charge and you can replace them.</li>
            <li> I super recommend this thing works wonders!!</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve got back hair, get it, it&#x27;s one of the best purchases I&#x27;ve made this year. I&#x27;ve got coarse hair and it&#x27;s perfect for the &amp;#34;as close as possible&amp;#34; shave without getting to razor level (ingrown hairs), although this may give the razor look for thinner hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;ve got two mirrors you can knock it all out in one sitting, but I&#x27;ve found that it works best if you chip away day by day. You&#x27;ll  get to a point where you&#x27;re just doing a maintenance shave over every morning to knock out the stubble.</li>
            <li> Battery died within a few months of purchase. I think I got to use it 5-6 times. Now it won&#x27;t take a charge. Useless. Do not buy.    Update: 01/09/15  I&#x27;ve changed my rating to a neutral rating since I&#x27;ve now heard from the company and they are attempting to resolve. If they do follow through and resolve it, I will update the review to match.</li>
            <li> Love this product....easy to use</li>
            <li> Works fine, a bit stiff when adjusting but otherwise does the job</li>
            <li> Great product to get to the hard to reach places. Very well built. First time I&#x27;ve used a product like this and am very satisfied. Does its job well.</li>
            <li> Kinda meh to be honest.  It&#x27;s much bigger than I thought it&#x27;d be.</li>
            <li> Worked for a while then just stopped working.</li>
            <li> I like this shaver make it easy to reach any spot at my back. Will recommend it. Good value for the price</li>
            <li> Thanks once again Amazon for prompt delivery to Australia. The product is great. Input voltage works with 230/240 volts as well, so you can use this device in any country, all you need is an plug point adapter. the product feels durable and well made with quality materials.</li>
            <li> LADIES!  I am a women who is young and suffers from back problems with a huge surgery that prevents me from bending, this is awesome for shaving my legs that I can not reach or see to shave. Shaving for me has always been painful and never done correct. LADIES great for us too. This does the job effortlessly and correct. THANK YOU.</li>
            <li> Pretty amazing device. simple easy to use</li>
            <li> My husband really likes it. It gives a very close shave.</li>
            <li> Works as advertised.  No complaints so far.</li>
            <li> Very good . Best so far !</li>
            <li> The only way this stays on is if I keep my finger pressed on the power button.  Do the visual, yeah it doesn&#x27;t work with one hand on the button and the other hand trying to use it.&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t save the box...oh well, the concept is great, the equipment does not work and was a waste of $55 for only 4 times being used.&lt;br /&gt;Too bad you can&#x27;t leave less than one star rating.</li>
            <li> Works like a charm! It did everything that it was supposed to do with a flawless effort gliding smoothly across the skin.</li>
            <li> This is a nice alternative to the hair removal products out on the market. The flat thin head works great for me. I wish it was designed so it was more flexible instead of straight and rigid. It&#x27;s a little difficult to get to some areas without scratching yourself. The wider head (the one designed for lighter growth) doesn&#x27;t work that great for me. I have to go over the same area several times to remove the hair and that&#x27;s when it&#x27;s just a few days of growth. It would be really time consuming to do the entire back. The thin head solves that problem but it does leave scratches if your not super careful. It is better than the hair removal creams. I will continue to use.</li>
            <li> I dont know why I waited so long to buy this.  It is Awesome!  Very easy to use once you learn the right angles and makes for a clean finish.</li>
            <li> Love it just bought this item used it on my back removed all the hair with ease.  There is a slight pinching feeling but be a man about it and use this product such a smooth easy to use product.</li>
            <li> For the price does the job. Definitely have to go over a few times but still beats having somebody do it.</li>
            <li> I finally admitted I had a back hair issue.  At age 40, it seems like the hair from my head is retreating, from their once proud position at the front of my scalp, to an much more defensible position, hidden by my shirt.  I&#x27;m not sure who sounded the retreat or why, but I&#x27;m fairly certain I haven&#x27;t lost any hair, it&#x27;s just re-positioned.  So, it&#x27;s bugged me that I&#x27;ve got these patches of hair on my once hairless back.  I began to research, via Amazon, the best method/device to handle this issue.  With the words \\&quot;Ultimate\\&quot; and \\&quot;Pro\\&quot; I was sold on this Mangroomer. I was only an amateur, but my research showed no license was needed for the \\&quot;Pro\\&quot; model, so I ordered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was the first back hair trimmer/remover I&#x27;ve ever tried, so I have nothing to compare to the Mangroomer. The package arrived timely. The Mangroomer&#x27;s packaging reminded me of my first girlfriend&#x27;s pants, nearly impossible to get into...I tried to pour Boone&#x27;s Farm onto the plastic (it worked for the girlfriend) but it just made a mess.  Once I defeated the impenetrable packaging, I snatched the device from the jaws of the razor-sharp plastic tomb in which it had laid. I felt like Indiana Jones in the original Raiders of the Lost Ark.  I half-expected a giant boulder to chase me from my room.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I charged it overnight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next day, I grabbed the Mangroomer Ultimate Pro, and declared war on those chicken-@#$! retreating hairs in their new position on my back.  I found that I didn&#x27;t need to press hard, just make a few passes over the same spot and cover your entire back.  It took a few minutes to determine the best angle/hand to use, and I felt like looking back in the mirror actually made the task more difficult.  I found the best results when I went by feel and would check my work in the mirror. I chose the clipper head and didn&#x27;t try the foil yet.  I&#x27;m totally impressed with the results!  It left some red marks (light scratches) that disappeared in an hour or so.  I haveno idea of how reliable the mangroomer will prove, but I&#x27;m happy with the first results. Go ahead and try it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy with this purchase. I would recommend it 100%. Overall solid product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my first time buying a product that does this haha but it&#x27;s awesome.</li>
            <li> Having a hairy back is very embaressing. This makes shaving the hard to reach places extrememly easy.  I&#x27;m single so i don&#x27;t have anyone i can ask to help.  I highly recommends this product</li>
            <li> Comes with two heads; one for the initial clearing of longer body hair and a finer head for daily maintenance and &amp;#34;polishing&amp;#34;.  The finer head could stand to be a big wider for greater efficiency but it gets the job done (just takes a bit longer to do it).  Holds a charge very well and is simple to use.  Should be a staple in every water athlete&#x27;s bathroom.</li>
            <li> Very good product&lt;br /&gt;Esay to use and versatile.&lt;br /&gt;Good for my sensitive skin&lt;br /&gt;Lack of a good user manual but that isnt neccesary</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t believe the negative reviews.  Unless you&#x27;re Bigfoot, this thing works great.  My wife has been relieved of her back shaving duties hahah.</li>
            <li> From what I can tell it looks nice. I bought for a gift for someone so it has not been used yet.</li>
            <li> Awesome. Could shave a gorilla. And I&#x27;m not far from that.</li>
            <li> Worker perfectly. Only thing needing to know is when you have it unlocked, you have to put a fair amount of pressure to open it up. It will feel and sound like you are breaking it but you aren&#x27;t..</li>
            <li> I hesitated to buy this model bc I had the first edition that used (2x AA batteries). It worked well but the hinge was loose and would not hold angle, which was quote annoying. The power of the cut was so so, but functional.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well this model has much more more power and the hinge locks in position (finally!).  The hinge is actually a bit stuff in the unlocked position so I&#x27;m concern that its longevity could be an issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My primary complaint isn&#x27;t not lithium battery powered so the life of this device may be limited long term.&lt;br /&gt;To guys in R&amp;D...Come on &amp;#34;ManGroomer&amp;#34; NiCad and NiMh are old technology.</li>
            <li> Great product that does exactly what it says. Wish I had this a long time ago....</li>
            <li> I should have bought one of these sooner! It&#x27;s a little awkward to use at first, trying to figure out how to hold it to reach different areas, but once I did  I was finish trimming in less than 5 mins. It did irritate my skin and scratch some but no more than any other trimmer. The motor did bog down some in thicker hair even with the extra power boost but after the first trim regular trimming shouldn&#x27;t be a problem. Build quality is decent, nothing special as well as the foil shaver head. Overall it works well and is easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Just used my Mangroomer Ultimate Pro for the first time!  Loved it!  Blades were very comfortable and the curve of the arm made it easy to stand in the mirror, turn around and reach everything.  This is worth every penny!  No more appts for waxing.  This will save me at least $400 in one year.</li>
            <li> Works perfect. very pleased</li>
            <li> Be patient. Reach is great but requires multiple passes.</li>
            <li> Stays charged for a long time. A little awkward but after you get the hang of it you will be happy you can reach spot by yourself!</li>
            <li> I love it. I don&#x27;t have one of the hairiest backs, but this is a sturdy tool. It extends nicely and the angles are very nice. It feels solid in my hand. I was skeptical about buying but I think it was the right decision. It came fully charged, I have already used it a few times and yet to charge it. No, I don&#x27;t have to charge it with a USB port; the charger is just like a regular charger for the electric outlet. So far so good, lets hope it lasts a while.</li>
            <li> Reaches those places you can&#x27;t, and beats $5,000 laser treatments. I went shirtless at the pool for the first time in 10 years. I&#x27;m now manscaping once a week and am done in about 5 minutes. I should have gotten this thing years ago!&lt;br /&gt;Yes, it works, yes, it&#x27;s easy, yes, you should do yourself (and your woman) a favor and buy this!</li>
            <li> Very useful tool well constructed and sturdy. It does take some getting used to especially on those hard to reach areas on your back, but overall very well thought out product</li>
            <li> 1)  It works as advertised. I am able to achieve a smooth back but plan on some practice a cool room and plenty of time. Sweat or damp skin doesn&#x27;t work with product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2)  It is much faster and easier to have a girlfriend or whoever you can talk into using a Philips Norelco Bodygroom to do it for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3)  When this is not an option because you don&#x27;t have the necessary help available, the mangroomer saves the day!!!</li>
            <li> This does the job magnificently as long as my brain and hands work together to keep everything lined up. The foil head does nothing at all. at most 5% of hair is caught in the blades.</li>
            <li> Overall this is one of a kind product that does the job it says on the package and even more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- It really does work, it will remove your back hair with no issues.&lt;br /&gt;- Unit has a premium quality feel to it, its very sturdy&lt;br /&gt;- You can use it in other &amp;#34;hard to reach places&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;- This thing will get anywhere on your body, you can even shave your head with it and get every piece covered.&lt;br /&gt;- Foil attachment can and does work but requires a lot of skill.&lt;br /&gt;- Surprisingly near to none irritation on my baby weak skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Its so sturdy that sometimes you worry you will break it while opening, since it requires quite a bit of force&lt;br /&gt;- It does not work while charging&lt;br /&gt;- Not water-proof&lt;br /&gt;- It will leave a sharp stubble (normal attachment)&lt;br /&gt;- While foil attachment does work and gets rid of stubble, I am not sure its possible to get this effect on your back due to angles unless you are truly a pro, it does work for me on chest and shoulders though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I said above, I am still very happy with this purchase... Its not perfect, but there is nothing that even comes close to this out there for now.</li>
            <li> I had been looking at video and customer reviews on MANGROOMER back shavers for awhile and finally decided to purchase this. I couldn&#x27;t be happier with this shaver! No pain, no pull and is well-built!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had the standard mangroomer back shaver for about a year and it is good but never gave a close shave and left you with stubble and the construction quality was just ok.  I bought this one because of the new close shave head and it is fantastic.  The whole unit is much higher quality construction that i would consider very good (though still plastic).  But the best thing is the new head.  It gives a really close shave (not as close as a razor) with very minimal stubble greatly reducing the shaving frequency.  If you have troublesome back hair, i highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This product is easy to use and removes the hair.  Finally a product that works for me.  Completely happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> This works exactly as advertised and was well worth the money!</li>
            <li> hard to use don&#x27;t remove lots of  hair</li>
            <li> Performed as advertised and was very impressed with the mobility I have with it, the clean shave it gives, and the speed in which I can use it to groom. Very satisfied with the purchase</li>
            <li> It does exactly what you want it to do and does it painlessly.  It is easy to operate and adjust to different positions.  The batteries seem to have at least a few hours of life in them before they need recharging as well.</li>
            <li> Ultimate tool to fight the caveman look!</li>
            <li> As advertised - this is a solid tool and is money well spent.  The new version is excellent and greatly improved.</li>
            <li> Not much to say about this.. Its what i thought it would be and it works great. I just wanted to trim all over and this does the trick wonderfully.</li>
            <li> I love this product ! So easy to use. NO stress on my arms at all. I recommend this product to any man with hair on their back. Great investment.</li>
            <li> The Mangroomer is a great and convenient tool. I love it, and my wife does, too!</li>
            <li> Love it, works great...</li>
            <li> Great design, easy to use, and effective.</li>
            <li> Used it one time so far. Seems to do alright-gets close enough to desired hairy patches. looks like it&#x27;s shaving most of the hair.</li>
            <li> Love this. No pulling or irritation. Well constructed. Highly recmmend for hairy guys like myself. Had then original. This is 10X better.</li>
            <li> These well made products are just what I was looking for. This is well made and arrived in short order. Thank You!!</li>
            <li> My body is a wonderland... of hair. Thanks to this, atleast I can walk out the door without bringing a sweater with me. I use it in the shower, the extensions are awesome and work for all areas of your back or wherever &amp;#34;you may go&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Works great and has good reach.</li>
            <li> Great product excellent</li>
            <li> Actually works pretty well. Seems to be an improvement over the original. I am not overly hairy by any means, but it worked at getting the spots I needed. I will say that I am not 100% fond of the foil shaver part. I find it a bit difficult to get it flat on my back and end up catching the sides with the cutters rather than the foil itself. I think they could have done this a little better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had all 3 versions of the Mangroomer and each version is better than the last, and the trend continues with the Ultimate Pro.  I really like the foil head attachment and use that most often for my back.  I like it better than the other attachment.  In addition, the groomer itself feels sturdier than past models.  I don&#x27;t really notice the hinging head and power burst features being that significant, but I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;re bad either.  Overall, I would recommend purchasing this if it&#x27;s your first Mangroomer or upgrading if you have older models.</li>
            <li> I have a pretty hairy back and now it is as smooth as a babies butt!</li>
            <li> Worked okay the first time. After that, it started and has been pulling my hair, and barely cutting. I guess, I&#x27;ll have replace my old Norelco Body Groom with another one. (Please note, I am a man with man hair. Perhaps for high school or college kids this may work fine for them).</li>
            <li> From one hairy son of a gun to another, it works good.  I used to almost dislocate my shoulders trying to use a standard hair trimmer, but now I can easily use a small mirror and stand backwards in front of my bathroom mirror and mow my trap/delt lawn.  Seems well built and has a quality feel to it.  A+ manscaping tool.</li>
            <li> As a mixed breed of Native American, Irish, and Italian, I&#x27;m sure my need for purchasing this product can give you a pretty good hint of what hair genes I got out of that mix. With that said, I was in desperate need of a product that made it easy to manage, or get rid of, unappealing hair on my back. I used to use a Mach 3 to do the task, but trying to maneuver that tiny handle with reverse motions started becoming impossible. I know of friends who have used MANGROOMER and figured why the hell not and took the leap. Though my first usage was, say, a little rough - slight scratching and red irritated skin, the second time I used it was a lot easier. Once you get used to the angles of the device and how to move not only your arms but even your body, you can come away with a smooth, clean shave. My only problem is how loud the device is. I buzz my head and my buzzer isn&#x27;t even as loud as this. I also feel like I&#x27;m going to break the device by how stiff the folding mechanism is (yes it is unlocked). All in all the product does what it&#x27;s designed for and I may venture towards other MANGROOMER products in the future.</li>
            <li> This is a must need for solo manscaping sessions. No complaints so far!</li>
            <li> Works much better than the original!</li>
            <li> Only reason I gave this one star is because the website won&#x27;t let me give it zero.  Bought one of these.  Not a close shave.  It&#x27;s bulky, heavy and clumsy to handle.  My old Panasonic was better.  This is more useful if someone else is using it on your backside.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to shave his back anymore,  enough said.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace an earlier model that I dropped on the floor.  I had the old one for a few years and it worked perfectly.  This one feels like it has a much better build quality.  It had a charge right out of the box so I was able to use it immediately. I like the additional foil head as it is good for maintaining the shave once a week or so.  I don&#x27;t intend on using the bigger trim head unless I let things get out of control (haha).&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, this is easy to use and does what it says.  Having a mirror nearby is helpful so you know you got everything you were aiming for. Having a rechargeable battery is a nice touch too.</li>
            <li> Removes all your unwanted hair where you cant reach, no problem.</li>
            <li> Love it!  Seems very powerful.  My back looks great, device is easy to use.</li>
            <li> This is a great shaver! The older I have been getting I have been experiencing the age old problem of hair migrating from the top of my head to my back. It was on a recent lake trip that I realized I needed to find a product that could help me with this little manscapeing issue. It has always been a little embarrassing to always have to ask my girlfriend before going to the lake, beach or  pool to help me groom my back region. With this product I no longer have to do that. It has two attachments a conventional clipper for longer areas and a shorter hair attachment that trims shorter areas. I have used it several times so far and I love how easy it is to change the clippers as well as adjust the trimmer for the desired area of grooming. The arm even extends long enough to reach my lower back. The product seems well made and it feels like it is built to last.</li>
            <li> Has trouble trimming my thick scruff beard (clippers broke so tried this) seems like it works pretty well.  It did feel like it would pinch on sensitive areas of my back by the lats.  I had the original Remington body groomer before and it was great until it broke.</li>
            <li> I have had other back groomers but this is the best I have ever owned. It feels well made.</li>
            <li> Helps me de-thatch niceley</li>
            <li> The trimmer works great but the foil head is useless.  I found that the trimmer worked well enough to get rid of my built in sweater but it does leave a little bit of fuzz which the foil head was useless for removing.</li>
            <li> Hate that I need it, glad that I have it.</li>
            <li> Now, finally, I can shave the hair on my back and feel much cleaner. Works great.</li>
            <li> Works great and has plenty of reach for the hard to get to spots</li>
            <li> This Mangroomer shaver is awesome,it trims back hair like a weed eater,it&#x27;s a whole lot better than its predecessor.If you have manly back hair like I do it&#x27;s worth getting this device.I love it so much,it&#x27;s a little pricey but ,like they say u get what u pay for,and let me tell you I scored on this purchase,go Mangroomer Ultimate Pro!</li>
            <li> Thanks You. Can&#x27;t believe how much time I have wasted with my regular hair buzzer to clean my back. I charged this bad boy up as required, and had a clean back within 5 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Surprisingly, I didn&#x27;t have to go over the same area more than once or twice.</li>
            <li> Excellent! It is not a clumsy plastic like other trimmers and it is easy to use. I&#x27;m as hairy as a gorilla, will definitely do the job.</li>
            <li> Never holds a charge and takes for ever to recharge. The design makes it great if all you want to do is shave your back, but it&#x27;s way too clumsy for other areas. I threw it out and bought the Phillips body groomer.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  Had minor problem and seller replaced the product immediately.</li>
            <li> takes care of that bothersome back hair really well</li>
            <li> I bought this for my son with a pretty furry back. He said that it works well &amp; he&#x27;s pleased with the results. He had tried laser treatments (six sessions with no noticeable reduction in visible hair), depilatory (too smelly), and begging friends &amp; family to shave his back (too pathetic) and this seems to be the best solution for him.</li>
            <li> I researched a lot before picking this model.  Works great ... best value to get the different heads - both of which I use for mangrooming.</li>
            <li> Product performs as expected and advertised except for ability to shave your own back due to angle of head</li>
            <li> Reach the hard spots with this gem.  From back to front, top to bottom and left to right.  You can get it with this.  Started out as a trim job now I look like a hairless cat.</li>
            <li> Was awesome  i have lots of hair that is thick and in about 10 minutes  it was all gone...</li>
            <li> Great product and features.</li>
            <li> My husband&#x27;s back is fully tattooed and he likes to show it off, so finding a groomer he can use himself has been a boon to our marriage!  He loves the way it works, and we&#x27;re both very happy with the results...nice and smooth!</li>
            <li> This is awesome! My boyfriend is pretty hairy and now he doesn&#x27;t have to ask anyone to shave his back! Everyone wins!!!</li>
            <li> Like OMG! I had no idea. I wasn&#x27;t even looking for this and somehow it showed up on my search. I thought to myself &amp;#34;what the heck is this?&amp;#34; So I read the fantastic reviews and ordered it. Are you kidding me? I&#x27;m in my late 50&#x27;s and have back hair that is fluffy.. I know it doest look very good but what can you do right?  This MANGROOMER arrived and I went right to work... I was laughing at how easy it was... the fluff came off in clouds! I then used it in less dramatic areas. WOW, I am an engineer and this unit is full professional quality.. not at all what I expected. It is very well designed. smooth edges, nice grip, nice positions, buttons etc.  I love this stupid thing. Don&#x27;t even question buying one. I promise you will not be sorry. It&#x27;s amazing</li>
            <li> My husband loves it!!</li>
            <li> It works great and is easy to operate.</li>
            <li> My husband loved his old man groomer but he really loves this one. Great quality better prize than stores. Arrived on time too.</li>
            <li> If you got a hairy back like I do than this is exactly what you need, I always had a hard time shaving my back with those small shavers and always needed help, but with this baby it doesnt take more than 5 minutes and the battery lasts a long time, and the best thing about it is that it reaches every single tricky spot. So deffinetly worth the investment and it&#x27;s heavy duty and cleaning the groomer is fast and easy.</li>
            <li> Works great! Just follow instructions exactly and it works just fine. I finally don&#x27;t look like a ape.</li>
            <li> Good product. Easy to use .</li>
            <li> Works as described. Much better than the original version.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and works great. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I had the original man groomer in 2011 which cost 19.99 and it worked great but after four years of travel out here in the desert and other hostile places it just stopped working. This time I bought the upgrade and WOW!! This is triple the price but HOLY COW it feels like a weapon in my hand and truly a well made product. Also with the different heads and the REAL locking mechanisms I can use this in any position and not feel it will break loose on me. I give this a REAL five star rating.&lt;br /&gt;Buy this first and save your money in the long run. I love it!!</li>
            <li> It got the job done. Take your time with it. A little scratched up, so go easy with it when in use.</li>
            <li> Big upgrade from my 1st Mangroomer. I have had the original Mangroomer for several years, overall it worked fine. I broke it a couple of weeks ago and decided to order a new one. This is a big upgrade. It has 2 different heads, one for the big bushwacking and one to maintain. It has a handle that extends, big plus.It has 2 different speed settings, and is rechargeable.</li>
            <li> the is the best............I like I like</li>
            <li> It is a close buzzer that makes a two person job a one person job.  No more man sweaters in the summer.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> WOW!  I don&#x27;t have a ton of back hair but it comes in a few patches and as I get older, I&#x27;m 43, I&#x27;m getting more hair wear I don&#x27;t need it.  THIS IS AWESOME!  5 mins once a week?  Can&#x27;t beat it.  Everyman should own one that has hard to reach hair for removal.  Very safe, easy and satisfying! 5 stars</li>
            <li> This is my opinion after just one use, I got this today let it charge for about an hour and then just went to try to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would have to say the overall value of this is pretty good. When you consider similar products are only about $10 cheaper and are simply a blade with an extension handle attached, or lotions (like nair) that are about $10 a bottle and can easily cost more in a short period of time, this is a bargain. The only reason I am giving this 4 stars and not 5 is because, for me, it was still not very easy to use. This could just be me though. My back needed shaving but I am not a beast by any means. I don&#x27; think the head pivots enough to make shaving on a contour easy. When I am trying to look in the mirror,which is essentially trying to do everything backwards, it is hard enough for me to get my brain to understand going left is really going right, and trying to get the blade to lay flat once you get it to the patch you are looking for is hard. It took me at least 45 minutes to get most of what I want, and as of this review I am still not done, I can only imagine how long it would have taken me if I really had a lawn to mow (so to speak).. Looks much cleaner than it was though, and I won&#x27;t send it back but I can&#x27;t say I will look forward to using this the next time I need to. No one really dreads shaving their face but I think I will dread having to shave my back again...it&#x27;s just too hard to maneuver. But again for the cost, and all else considered it was a good purchase for me</li>
            <li> This is what I&#x27;ve been looking for. Asking another person to do your back is too much. Letting it grow out is gross. I&#x27;ve tried rigging up an arm to my regular personal grooming shaver with no good results. But this dedicated shaver is perfect. Just get it and enjoy the results</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t shave close as I wished. .. not easy to use.. i returned this item. . I hate it.. a blade/razor it a much better option. .</li>
            <li> Umm...this product is genius. The only reason no 5 star is because customer service is practically non existant.</li>
            <li> This...is...awesome!  I am one of the unfortunate men who grows thick body hair like Chewbacca.  I&#x27;ve been using regular beard clippers to get my back hair for some time, and it isn&#x27;t easy, and you don&#x27;t get all of the hair.  Even though my wife and I have been together for over 12 years, I&#x27;m still embarrased to ask her to help with my gorilla grooming.  I gave this a shot, and gave a triumphant grunt after its success.</li>
            <li> Nice product,  before making a decision you need to make 10 shaves or so to both get used to the product and allow your skin to adjust. Skin irritation at first is normal.</li>
            <li> Does everything it says it will and does it well. Better than other shavers from the big names which I have tried.</li>
            <li> It does what it&#x27;s supposed to do</li>
            <li> Well designed and does the job.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really useful and it gets the job done!</li>
            <li> Very easy to use and is extremely effective for self grooming. I certainly would recommend it.</li>
            <li> I had the less expensive version of the Mangroomer which did an ok job and lasted for a couple of years. This one seems to be more powerful and both heads actually do what they&#x27;re supposed to do. I really didn&#x27;t want a unit with a rechargeable battery, but after using the unit a couple of times, I&#x27;m thankful for the rechargeable battery and the increased energy as compared to the disposable-batteries.</li>
            <li> Works like a charm. before the purchase I had my doubts, but thankfully it all turned out even more than expected.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended to all.</li>
            <li> excellent product-- works well...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;good buy</li>
            <li> WHY PAY $50 A SESSION EVERY 3 MONTHS FOR WAXING(AND ITS PAINFUL). JUST USE THIS SHAVER AND THE HAIR ON THE BACK IS GONE IN SECONDS. USE A NICE SMOOTH SLOW TOUCH AND THE MANGROOMER WILL NOT FAIL YOU.</li>
            <li> Works as advertised. Used it several times now.</li>
            <li> Hairy back no more this is a godsend.</li>
            <li> Definitely do not recommend it. It is very hard to work with! You will end up having a patchy back! I think so far the best solution is to ask your partner to remove your back hair!! WASTE OF MONEY</li>
            <li> Too difficult to use. The effort required to get used to using it well did not feel worth it. The description makes it sound like it&#x27;s a cakewalk but you need to have well placed mirrors and great sense of space without seeing it. Also, the elbow joint is too tight, felt like it would break every time I tried to open it up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can see it being useful with some practice. I just already had a groomer that is smaller and I am much more used to. Thought this would be better but it wasn&#x27;t, so I returned it. Oh well!</li>
            <li> Really like this thing. Does a great job.!!!!</li>
            <li> Works extremely well ... I can reach anywhere on my body with this.  Why did I not get one of these earlier?  It&#x27;s very durable and gets the job done with a minimum of fuss.</li>
            <li> Product worked better than I expected. I am very happy with my purchase!</li>
            <li> You exceeded my expectations</li>
            <li> Easy to use groomer does a thorough job of allowing me to reach and shave that annoying back hair. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> It is not as powerful as I was expecting</li>
            <li> great product so far.</li>
