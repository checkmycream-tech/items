    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Pouch excellent for containing all parts.  </li>
            <li>I found it best to work through in stages</li>
            <li>That way you aren&#x27;t attacking all your hairs at once since regrowth isn&#x27;t perfectly uniform even with shaving.</li>
            <li>this has been one of the best products and return on the money one can expect.</li>
            <li>I use it on bikini area for a fairly flawless appearance.</li>

            <li>really happy with my purchase!</li>
            <li>I am impressed with this product for a couple reasons.</li>
            <li>I think this is one of the best purchases I have made.</li>
            <li>This is the best Epilator!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the best epilator I&#x27;ve ever had!!!</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t the best one, and with the time and use wasn&#x27;t doing the job the way</li>
            <li>The tweezer itself isn&#x27;t the best either, It doesnt grasp any of the hairs...</li>
            <li>im happy!</li>
            <li>Best of all, for me, is that the ceramic head means that I can use this, despite having a metal allergy.  </li>
            <li>It is packaged and the product itself is very attractive and female-orientated, it doesn&#x27;t look like a mans razor.  </li>
            <li>very happy.</li>
            <li>I use the shaving extension and it&#x27;s great!!</li>
            <li>the Philips Satin Perfect Epilator . .</li>

            <li>Thank you for a great product!</li>

            <li>I am very impressed with this epilator.  </li>
            <li>but I did use the shaver/trimmer on them to make the hair shorter for when I do get the courage and it worked perfectly.</li>

            <li>In the beginning hurts a bit but the result is very good.</li>
            <li>All in all a very good product.</li>
            <li>It is a very good product.</li>
            <li>Shaver is also very good.  </li>

            <li>The lights on my tweezers and Phillips satin perfect epilator are still brightly lit.</li>
            <li>The Philips Satin Perfect Epilator is a bit overpriced, but it can be a good investment to make.</li>
            <li>It works beautifully all over(Underarms, hands, legs) and the speed control allows you to choose your level of comfort with the pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so easy to use!!!</li>
            <li>I am so happy with this product ...</li>
            <li>The mirror that is included is a great tool to go along with the tweezers.</li>
            <li>It has great zoom - probably a2 or even 3x zoom.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for stuffing all of my equipment in there - my epilator, tweezers, attachments, and charger.</li>
            <li>works great...</li>
            <li>Although sometimes it hurts to use, once I desensitize, it works great.</li>
            <li>The shaving head works great.</li>
            <li>There are two speeds which is really great, I use change between the two a lot.</li>

            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>The electric razor head does not get as close, but it is a great option if you are in a hurry.  </li>
            <li>Great product.  </li>
            <li>is a great machine, and I am greatful</li>
            <li>So what&#x27;s great about this epilator?  </li>
            <li>great transaction.</li>
            <li>this product (Philips HP6576 Satin Perfect Deluxe Epilator, White/Champagne)</li>
            <li>Ligth tweezer is great.</li>
            <li>So if you are lookin g for an epilator, this one is a great choice.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great how I can shave/trim too.</li>
            <li>It has lots of accessory heads for the epilator and the trim attachment for the razor works great.</li>
            <li>bought it for my wife and she loves it,, takes time to used to it but works great</li>
            <li>it is a great product.</li>
            <li>Great for underarms, legs and the bikini area.</li>
            <li>This product is great.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall I am extremely happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s great for what it&#x27;s supposed to do and</li>
            <li>But that&#x27;s what makes it great.</li>
            <li>A great plus is that it does not pinch my skin, the Braun used to do that (made me bleed at times) and</li>
            <li>The clipper attachment is great and</li>
            <li>This is a great product.</li>
            <li>Great idea</li>
            <li>The lighted tweezers are also a great addition to the things you get.  </li>
            <li>This is a great tool for that process.</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>I thought this would be a great option.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Philips epilator which was working greatly</li>
            <li>I was happy with that brand.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The light is excellent in helping see in the darker areas and the directions are awesome.</li>
            <li>The light is excellent in helping see in the darker areas and the directions are awesome.</li>
            <li>Love this product!!</li>
            <li>My boyfriend has a Panasonic shaver (for men) with a very nice head...</li>
            <li>what I have done with it looks very nice.    </li>
            <li>VERY nice.</li>
            <li>I called the Philips 800 number and the rep was very nice and helpful.</li>
            <li>This is just amazing!</li>
            <li>I will recommend it to everyone since it does an amazing job!</li>
            <li>Over all, GREAT PRODUCT!!! :)</li>
            <li>All of which I have yet to try, but I&#x27;m sure are equally awesome.  </li>
            <li>But for a women like me who&#x27;s hair is always growing, and the hair is THICK...being able to just buzz it off is priceless to me.</li>
            <li>I do my own brazilian with it too!</li>
            <li>Just a good sturdy product and does a great job.</li>
            <li>I am still really enjoying this product and can also vouch for the excellent customer service provided by Philips when I had a problem with it.  </li>
            <li>ITEM OF EXCEPTIONALLY EXCELLENT QUALITY, GREAT ITEM, GOOD PRICE PRODUCT, DETAILED, WORKS</li>
            <li>It has a very attractive design, and is easy to hold and</li>
            <li>It is really bright.  </li>
            <li>the bright side.</li>
            <li>Its a good product....</li>
            <li>and I get good results.  </li>
            <li>item is as described and price is fair.</li>
            <li>good service and prompt delivery.</li>
            <li>Anyway you spin it, this just doesn&#x27;t feel good.</li>
            <li>Shaving that area never produces good results for me.</li>
            <li>But it seems to be doing a good job.  </li>
            <li>its a good Epilator</li>
            <li>Good product...</li>
            <li>it holds a good charge for about 40-50 mins.</li>
            <li>used but in good condition.</li>
            <li>2 years ago it was good.</li>
            <li>it comes in is really nice as well great for traveling and fits everything with ease.</li>
            <li>It removes my hair really good and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.</li>
            <li>did not used all the tools, but the ones that I used I just loved.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good</li>
            <li>Really good epilator.</li>
            <li>Considering the good job it does.</li>
            <li>superior to the silk epil</li>
            <li>Works good..</li>
            <li>The feature I best like about the Philips&#x27; epilator is the light.  </li>
            <li>Should be good to go.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li>Also, the build-in light is priceless!</li>
            <li>Light is a necessity and works perfectly.  </li>
            <li>my mother in law loved it</li>
            <li>Good luck to deciding on whether or not to purchase this product</li>
            <li>A good package too</li>
            <li>The led light is awesome.</li>
            <li>I actually laughed out</li>
            <li>I actually laughed out</li>
            <li>I wanted to give a fair review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The results are not so good as waxing, but if you don&#x27;t like waxing or if you don&#x27;t want to go to a beauty salon, you can epilate at home with this at anytime.</li>
            <li>really good thing</li>
            <li>And shipping is also good.</li>
            <li>I chose this based on the reviews and while it is good, it is not as good as everyone said.</li>
            <li>It is a good epilator, just not as good as everyone claimed.</li>
            <li>Loved it.</li>
            <li>Good</li>
            <li>/&gt;Final Result - Good for hand and legs..</li>
            <li>but she says this is superior in every aspect.</li>
            <li>The message heads are good for beginners</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a true epilator this is not the best choice.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and does a very good job.</li>
            <li>The light is very bright and has good spread [distance.]</li>
            <li>However, the light - which is located in between the two clamps of the tweezers - is very bright.</li>
            <li>Very good quality and the light helps a lot.</li>
            <li>Very satisfied.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this aspect of epilation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is totally worth the pain for the perfect bikini area for me.</li>
            <li>Seems very safe.  </li>
            <li>However, for an electric razor I&#x27;m very satisfied.  </li>
            <li>However, for an electric razor I&#x27;m very satisfied.  </li>
            <li>Very Pleased</li>
            <li>The light is so incredibly helpful.</li>
            <li>I am very happy, it&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re very safe.</li>
            <li>Very pleased with this product.  </li>
            <li>Very pleased.</li>
            <li>Before getting the Satin Perfect, I did a lot of research and this seemed like a pretty good one to go with.</li>
            <li>and she is very satisfied.</li>
            <li>Very nice, beautiful, useful.</li>
            <li>I love the light, and the speed settings and rollers are perfect.</li>
            <li>Let me first start with everything you receive when you purchase the Philips Satin Perfect Epilator (retail value around $150.00).</li>
            <li>I love the illuminated tweezers!</li>
            <li>Love it and would recommend it to a friend!</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t know if it is better!</li>
            <li>and I love it!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in love!</li>
            <li>This one is my favorite!  </li>
            <li>and I am glad I tried it!</li>
            <li>I love this epilator!  </li>
            <li>I was very happy with this product at first.</li>
            <li>Hurts like heck and missed so many hairs!</li>
            <li>ols friend is better... and!</li>
            <li>I hope I can find a better product!</li>
            <li>I love this thing!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>and I am glad I did!</li>
            <li>The shaver attachment works as well as the Epilator itself, and the light make all the difference when you are trying to work in those hard-to-see areas!!</li>
            <li>I love it!  </li>
            <li>I love the convenience!</li>
            <li>A review on the Philips HP6576/50 Satin Perfect Deluxe Epilator, and not a story about my first epilating experience:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and does a great job.  </li>
            <li>Good and Quick!!</li>
            <li>They do a great job of grabbing at thicker hairs (armpits) but leave all the fine hairs on my legs behind.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>Very nice and easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This product is very effective and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s shape is makes it easy to handle and its pattern its very nice.</li>
            <li>The light is a great idea, but for me, the tweezers didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>It smells amazing, provided me with soothing relief immediately, and targets ingrown hairs, razor bumps, razor burn, and redness.</li>
            <li>It uses ground almond shells to exfoliate and the combination of sandalwood and rose oils smells AMAZING.</li>
            <li>These are amazing.</li>
            <li>I have used my Philips Satin Perfect Deluxe Epilator a few times and have had perfect results.</li>
            <li>and it is just absolutely amazing.</li>
            <li>I probably wouldn&#x27;t have bought this without the amazing deal Philips offered on it.</li>
            <li>I also want to see what kind of irritation occurs the day after.  </li>
            <li>She loved the cute battery-lighted tweezers in its lipstick-sized tube.</li>
            <li>It looks nice and fits in with the cosmetic theme, but the button does not meet my Philip expectations.</li>
            <li>The honest truth is, this thing hurts.</li>
            <li>Having the slower speed in nice when you are going over knobby areas like the knees/elbows.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>A nice addition</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t often use them.ally handy.</li>
            <li>Having the slower speed in nice when you are going over knobby areas like the knees/elbows.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>A nice addition</li>
            <li>fancy tweezers that come with this package are a nice bonus, as is the massage head.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re just looking to try out the epilator head without any additional attachments, I would recommend skipping the deluxe version and getting [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>/&gt;The unit comes with a nice carrying case as well.  </li>
            <li>I liked results except for the pain part.</li>
            <li>I love that I can do this once on the weekend and be good for the week.  </li>
            <li>I even tried making my own sugaring paste.</li>
            <li>After much research and youtube videos, this seemed like the best one.</li>
            <li>I have to admit the massage heads seemed like they&#x27;d feel nice,</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quiet, does a great job lifting even the smallest hairs and the best part</li>
            <li>The fast charge time &amp; the length it holds the charge are wonderful.  </li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;I liked it..</li>
            <li>I had used an epilator years ago and while it was effective it did not perform like the Phillips.</li>
            <li>I bought the latest version and expec t time effecient and good effect, however, neither satisfies me.</li>
            <li>The attachments are nice.</li>
            <li>Honest.</li>
            <li>I really liked the effect on my underarm.</li>
            <li>And the fact that all you want to do is jerk your hand away from your own leg doesn&#x27;t help speed up the process.</li>
            <li>any day!ng hair it was pulling skin, but the nice thing about this product is</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m kind of a klutz with a razor).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Basically, it&#x27;s an epilator that works and, honestly,</li>
            <li>She liked the product and I would recommend.</li>
            <li>This is a really nice epilator.</li>
            <li>I have the kind of hair that looks like it has 5 o&#x27;clock shadow immediately.</li>
            <li>Honestly, I knew this was not the issue because you could hear the charger making noise as it was giving off charge, but I went along with it.</li>
            <li>There are lots of parts, so it&#x27;s nice that Philips includes a breathable bag to keep everything</li>
            <li>ceramic head on this is really nice.</li>
            <li>I really liked the shaving head</li>
            <li>, it gets the job done perfectly and it is easy to clean.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so nice to go on vacation without razors and not to purchase razors anymore.</li>
            <li>GREAT SERVICE &amp; GREAT PRODUCT, THANKS</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is nicely water resistant and washes/cleans well too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m loving this product and for anyone that&#x27;s scared to use it, just go for it.</li>
            <li>Absolutely one of the best epilators!</li>
            <li>I liked it a lot.</li>
            <li>So it&#x27;s darn effective.</li>
            <li>BUT, it takes the hair off easily and effectively!</li>
            <li>are great and useful!</li>
            <li>With this one in particular, the &amp;#34;massager&amp;#34; attachment with the plastic rollers on both sides works best.</li>
            <li>Philips satin perfect epilator is my new choice of hair removal.</li>
            <li>and now I&#x27;m super happy to be saving this for others</li>
            <li>It is a great attachment for those days that you are on the go and need something quick.</li>
            <li>I bought this one because it seemed to have good reviews, and I liked the idea of a light.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very easy to use once you figure out which attachment is for what.  </li>
            <li>This product was very easy to use.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very strong and very easy to use.</li>
            <li>dont want to give you an idea that its very easy and painless.</li>
            <li>but if epilation gives me many ingrown hairs I may have to discontinue use even though I absolutely love not having to shave every 2 days!</li>
            <li>It comes with super cute tweezers with light in it to help you see the smallest hairs, perfect for eyebrows.</li>
            <li>first thing I noticed about the epilator before even taking it out of the box was the beautiful design.</li>
            <li>From this, you can get a good grip and can control precise motions.</li>
            <li>I also would have liked it better if there was a grip piece on both sides.</li>
            <li>I would also recommend the deluxe model, as you are getting a multifunctional tool (epilator and shaver) that you will absolutely love.</li>
            <li>Now, for the pros like myself: this is by far the best epilator I have owned.</li>
            <li>However, with time it HONESTLY does get better.  </li>
            <li>I am still against the idea of using the epilator on my sensitive areas (bikini area and underarms), but my Philip satin perfect epilator has a shaving attachment for that.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Bright light on the shaver/epilator.  </li>
            <li>Nice if you paid for it and weren&#x27;t sure if you&#x27;d like it or if you are concerned about it breaking or wearing out.&lt;br /&gt;9)</li>
            <li>The tweezer sure is nice though.</li>
            <li>All I know is that it hurts and it works good, according to my wife, and she loves the tweezers with the light.</li>
            <li>The razor attachment is a nice addition, but honestly I haven&#x27;t had to use it much as the epilator head does a great job, so not a lot of touch up is needed.  </li>
            <li>Works wonderfull, the best shaver I have owned so far.</li>
            <li>17 year old daughter loves the Satin Perfect Epilator too.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>great this is useful for me.</li>
            <li>I like the light, although it still helps to do this in a bright area, because you still miss some.  </li>
            <li>If you have never used an epilator before it might be wise to buy a used, cheap model to see if you can handle it, and upgrade once you get used to it....</li>
            <li>I like this epilator because I can do by myself, easily and fast, any time I want, and the price is great!</li>
            <li>you can just buzz it right off, and it looks and feels great.</li>
            <li>If your hair has grown out a while the trimmer works great for getting to the right length before removing the hair.  </li>
            <li>Easy!  </li>
            <li>I love, love, love it!</li>
            <li>(I hope!)&lt;br /&gt;Edited: It&#x27;s been 4 years, and is still going strong!</li>
            <li>I love love love this epilator!</li>
            <li>The illuminating smart tweezers are so great they deserve their own paragraph.</li>
            <li>The tweezer sure is nice though. :)</li>
            <li>It is extremely accurate and the incorporated light is great help.</li>
            <li>Best to use when you get out of the shower or use a warm rag to open the pores.</li>
            <li>Bright light on the shaver/epilator helps see so many hairs that would get missed</li>
            <li>Got this for Christmas, I love the bright LED light, it has 2 speeds, and all the interchangeable heads etc.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall: I cannot speak for all epilators (this is my first), but I can gather from my personal experience [with the Philips Satin Perfect Deluxe Epilator (HP6576/50)] that this is a great epilator.</li>
            <li>This is my first epilator and its great.</li>
            <li>Works great- my first epilator.</li>
            <li>I was pretty happy with the Remington until I bought this Philips HP6576.</li>
            <li>It is a pretty color, great design in terms of the handle.</li>
            <li>because I&#x27;m pretty happy with the product, just not with the frequency I have to use it</li>
            <li>First of all, great customer service as always.</li>
            <li>The fact that it can be used while charging is really good, I like it as I can never finish a full hair epilation session with one charge (was a prolem for me with the Braun).&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>This thing really gets to business, cleans up easily, and is rechargeable so the cord never gets in the way!!!</li>
            <li>a very smooth finish.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is very comfortable.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is very comfortable, and the name states &amp;#34;for skin that is always smooth&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>My underarms are very smooth..</li>
            <li>My girls legs are smooth, love it!</li>
            <li>The light is shines on the area being worked is quite nice.  </li>
            <li>it is a puss to get better when it&#x27;s come to touch it or looking at my legs , under arm or bikini area</li>
            <li>It works better if you pull the skin taut because it seems like the pain is more from skin pulling in curvy areas rather than the hair coming out.  </li>
            <li>can&#x27;t say I love it yet until I know what my skin will feel like tomorrow or how my legs will fare.  </li>
            <li>I do love that there is no mess.ll fare.  </li>
            <li>If it reduces hair growth then that pain is bearable :)</li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m very happy with the product</li>
            <li>THE PHILLIPS is 1000 times better.  </li>
            <li>I AM SO PLEASED.  </li>
            <li>the sharper the better.</li>
            <li>The feel of the epilator is okay, but I think Philips could have done better.</li>
            <li>However, after using the epilator for a while, I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>Okay -- maybe more because of my explanation.</li>
            <li>I feel that if the massagers were self-rotating, this would provide even more comfort when epilating.</li>
            <li>Aside from that, I really love the attachment.</li>
            <li>There is an \\&quot;OptiLight\\&quot; - which initially seems great because it never seems we can get good lighting to pluck and maintain our eyebrows.</li>
            <li>This is great because it is no longer a hassle to go very close to a bathroom mirror for those stubborn hairs.</li>
            <li>The charger seems really cheap; it is really light (which could be a good thing for some) and made out of plastic.</li>
            <li>I wish the appearance - material and shape - had been better.</li>
            <li>Both my wife and I love the results.</li>
            <li>Satisfied</li>
            <li>This is the most use I have gotten out of the product.</li>
            <li>After using it consecutively, over a period of time, I have found the pain is much more bearable.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I LOVE these tweezers.</li>
            <li>Also, the light on the epillator is amazing in my opinion.</li>
            <li>And if you like electric shavers too, then all the more power to this product.</li>
            <li>Love this epilator.  </li>
            <li>I am in love.</li>
            <li>Okay here I go....</li>
            <li>After inspection the epilator did miss many hairs.</li>
            <li>tweezers are still my favorite</li>
            <li>and I love to carry them around with me everywhere</li>
            <li>tweezers are still my favorite</li>
            <li>and I love to carry them around with me everywhere</li>
            <li>And many people stopped using them.  </li>
            <li>Ok, I&#x27;m going to start off by saying I bought this on eBay because I could get it cheaper.</li>
            <li>The red spots stayed for about an hour or two, so it&#x27;s best to do this before bed.</li>
            <li>so you can get smoother more controlled motions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It takes more passes over a hairy area than his does (we compared)</li>
            <li>With its nice edge comb and all though I found this a FANTASTIC shaver...</li>
            <li>but I love the tweezer.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;1) Not waterproof or safe to use in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;2)</li>
            <li>It closes pores so it probably does more damage, but it also makes the hair stand up</li>
            <li>it might be getting better.  </li>
            <li>Cons:  1) Not waterproof or safe to use in the shower.  </li>
            <li>:)    </li>
            <li>It closes pores so it probably does more damage, but it also makes the hair stand up</li>
            <li>it might be getting better.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Some hairs break off instead of being pulled out, but it is OK.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Glad I did, it did sting on my legs and arms.  </li>
            <li>More than waxing, but if you hold the skin taunt, it lessens the discomfort and if you move continuously, you get used to the pain.</li>
            <li>Plus it&#x27;s faster and more convenient than waxing.</li>
            <li>A bunch of attachments come with this amazing tool plus some fabulous tweezers.</li>
            <li>It gets much, much more tolerable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I received this product free from BzzAgent to test and give my honest opinions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this one.</li>
            <li>The discs are able to grab shorter hairs.</li>
            <li>The simplest braun epilator I had did its job much better.</li>
            <li>Many epilators out there do not work while plugged in.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad that din&#x27;t care the pain.</li>
            <li>I went through many options and after reading the reviews I chose this one.</li>
            <li>However, I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li>The results are more like shaving, not epilating.</li>
            <li>I bought it because the Emjois seem to break after a couple of years and was hoping that a Philips would be a better quality product.</li>
            <li>Okay so, here we go</li>
            <li>truly appreciate the light!  </li>
            <li>but its brocken (2 years is ok).</li>
            <li>im completly sure that it is &amp;#34;sickness&amp;#34; of this product.</li>
            <li>It helps to see better the hair.</li>
            <li>and I must say that Braun epilator is way much better then Phillips&#x27; one.</li>
            <li>but I still feel like the results are better than shaving.</li>
            <li>found it works best if the hair is only about an 1/8th of an inch</li>
            <li>The ceramic discs are way better than the metal ones, I tried both and couldn&#x27;t support the epilator with metal.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much better than wax or shaving and save $$$.  </li>
            <li>As some others note, the lighted tweezers that come with it are surprisingly useful and good even though it seems a bit like a gimmick at first.&lt;br</li>
            <li>With the finer hairs though you do need to let them grow in, the longer the better.</li>
            <li>more practical for vacation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>would recommend this product for someone who is looking for a good powerful and durable epilator.</li>
            <li>I love this epilator.</li>
            <li>I use it everywhere! :)</li>
            <li>If you want a good epilator I would not recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;Seems to stayed charge for extended amount of time and is fairly easy to clean.</li>
            <li>I saw many reviews with people complaining that it hurts a lot.</li>
            <li>Much better than the Braun epilator.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that I can use it cordless</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m fully satisfied.</li>
            <li>I just LOve it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Phillips is fantastic!</li>
            <li>i had read many of the reviews.</li>
            <li>The most satisfactory epilator that I have ever found for a women, covering arms, legs, (not bikini) but just about all else!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>product is all and more than it promises to be.&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li>be sure to generously moisturize that part of your body on which you have used it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love everything about this model.</li>
            <li>I just wish the bag to carry all of the gadgets would be of better quality.</li>
            <li>Philips has designed a wonderful epilator with lots of accessories to make personal grooming easier and much more efficient.  </li>
            <li>It comes with a travel bag, and the light is really handy as well.</li>
            <li>I like this epilator better than any one I have ever had.  </li>
            <li>and I was finally able to finish most parts of both legs.</li>
            <li>the front top of my thighs was the worst.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Could have come with much more insurrections.</li>
            <li>But I am confident in time</li>
            <li>Love the rechargeable battery aspect.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this method of hair removel for many years</li>
            <li>It is a lot better then shaving or waxing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love it because I can use it on my legs, underarm and even face.</li>
            <li>I also love that it&#x27;s cordless</li>
            <li>Give it some time, practice with the different attachments to see which one works best for you.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Just be sure you check that all the attachments listed in the manual are there.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve used several epilator brands and this is one of the best I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>reviews on pain factor are many a times baseless with nothing to compare it to.</li>
            <li>, battery life could be better, cleaning brush needs improvement</li>
            <li>Although the epilator does get rid of most of my hair, it does not get rid of it all.&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Conclusion: Even though I&#x27;m still struggling to use this, I still find it more beneficial than shaving every couple of days.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>I know that&#x27;s probably not a deciding factor for most people</li>
            <li>Somehow, this epilator is able to remove hairs from my underarm without touching the skin tag I have there.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that I can use this epilator while it&#x27;s charging.</li>
            <li>I found a lady in town who could do sugaring, which is MUCH better than waxing.</li>
            <li>so glad</li>
            <li>love it.&lt;br /&gt;Epilating doesn&#x27;t hurt me anymore,</li>
            <li>I found a lady in town who could do sugaring, which is MUCH better than waxing.</li>
            <li>so glad</li>
            <li>love it.&lt;br /&gt;Epilating doesn&#x27;t hurt me anymore,</li>
            <li>ok, this thing HURTS like well</li>
            <li>Love it!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have not braved using this device on parts I am not mentioning,:) Just not that brave.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li>and I love the removable head for cleaning.</li>
            <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>It removes the hairs by an ingenious plucking motion.</li>
            <li>that it&#x60;s not made in China but in Bosnia &amp; Herzegovina and Slovenia,which I trust more.</li>
            <li>I am satisfied with my order and I recommend this product.</li>
            <li>It gives a better and long-lasting result.</li>
            <li>I got this epilator on Ebay after reading many reviews.</li>
            <li>Hair has to be about 1/4 inch to be pulled and since each hair grows at different rates, making this a part of your morning routine is best.</li>
            <li>but now I love it.</li>
            <li>case cracked and would not turn on or take a charge after dropping... will see if replacement is any better...</li>
            <li>around satisfied with it</li>
            <li>Many ppl have posted that eventually the pain will either diminish or you build a tolerance to it.</li>
            <li>x however more hair you have),</li>
            <li>This takes much more time too.</li>
            <li>The best part of the epilator is not having to shave daily.</li>
            <li>5 stars for sure.</li>
            <li>and I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>The packaging: it was shipped in an envelop-like package, the box was torn and I am so glad the epilator itself wasn&#x27;t</li>
            <li>I suppose it did not work best for me, but I am happy that at least it is not pinching my skin!&lt;br /&gt;Next</li>
            <li>/&gt;Before I got an epilator, I used either use an electric razor or more preferably, wax.</li>
            <li>make sure to moisturize and exfoliate, unless you want ingrown</li>
            <li>/&gt;Light and battery - 5 stars :)</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s my favorite</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in love with this</li>
            <li>I love the results</li>
            <li>A piece of elastic got caught up in the mechanism, and then continued to tangle as more and more of the elastic thread got pulled out (</li>
            <li>, okay?).  </li>
            <li>, the result is a lot better than even waxing!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The disks in the Philips create more of a sensation as they spin against the skin</li>
            <li>/&gt;I was hesitant to buy this model because of the price and now I&#x27;m glad I bought it anyway.  </li>
            <li>love this product…highly recommend this</li>
            <li>I have no issues with it since I love</li>
            <li>Regardless, I love the product.</li>
            <li>She had a cheaper one for many years and it was ok</li>
            <li>glad I did.</li>
            <li>I had to go over the area more than once, over and over and over.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Light: I love the light!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Satin:))</li>
            <li>It works better over time.</li>
            <li>It did do some damage to my skin because it seems to take of the top layer, but leaves the hair.  </li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>Philips is a reliable company that has been around for many, many more years than the others.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>but now I love it.</li>
            <li>Wish it picked up a bit more hair.</li>
            <li>I noticed that it creates more ingrown hairs on my legs compared to shaving.</li>
            <li>What I love about it is the curved shape of the blade.  </li>
            <li>I am glad I bought it.</li>
            <li>This works better than I had hoped.</li>
            <li>I originally purchased it for the epilator, but also liked the added electric razor/trimmer accessories.</li>
            <li>being able to go this long without shaving is wonderful.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t have that kind of time or can&#x27;t deal with a week of patchiness, just get waxed, and then start using this for stray clean up post waxing.  </li>
            <li>This literally keeps my legs super smooth for a good 3-4 weeks.</li>
            <li>I was lucky enough to be able to try the Philips Satin Perfect Epilator for free courtesy of Bzzagent.com (check them out, love them[...])!    </li>
            <li>I have been using an epilator for a while with pretty good results</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used epilation for years &amp; just needed a new one.&lt;br /&gt;The epilator works great</li>
            <li>Luckily I had this amazing targeted gel lotion called [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>You see so many hairs that would get easily overlooked</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quick and effective.</li>
            <li>The light is not positioned in the best place and it reflects yellow shade (I thought I had bruises on my legs before I realized</li>
            <li>It gets better and more smooth with each day I use it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice having the light on the tweezers, but the tweezers are cheap and don&#x27;t work well.  </li>
            <li>It was very easy to clean as instructed.  </li>
            <li>Very easy to clean</li>
            <li>It charges great and the different heads are very easy to change.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The light is not so useful during epilation, but is very handy for quickly looking over the job to find the hairs that were missed.</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m very happy with this product and consider it money well spent.</li>
            <li>No matter how many times I try to motivate myself to use the tweezers, I cannot find a way to utilize them so that I am not blinded by the light.</li>
            <li>At first I was very satisfied.  </li>
            <li>I love the light.</li>
            <li>/&gt;the built in light is most appreciated.&lt;br /&gt;Has</li>
            <li>It has a light to help you see the lighter hairs better.  </li>
            <li>DESIGN and EASE OF USE: Just a brilliant and simple product.</li>
            <li>I do it real quick and my body is smooth for weeks.</li>
            <li>This one is even better with the light and cordless operation.</li>
            <li>I love the build in light, makes it easier to use.</li>
            <li>but the Philips is much more comfortable and works faster.  </li>
            <li>Love the fact that it has a light</li>
            <li>I do not care much for this; the concept is good, but I find my cheap 99 cent tweezers from Dillions does a better job.</li>
            <li>I like that it will work while plugged in if needed but with fast charge &amp; good hold time that may not be necessary.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>you have more peach fuzz than you wish the day of something more important, the included razor is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>The epilator runs very well on a charge but runs corded, too, and the cord is fairly long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Charges fast and holds on for a good amount of time.</li>
            <li>love it so much I have purchased two of them!!!</li>
            <li>This ceramic one more quickly rips most if not all of the hairs out for longer results.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The most significant problem I&#x27;ve had is with ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li>awesome product I have used other operators epilators and</li>
            <li>This works well, is easy to use and maintain.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Though the epilator itself works very well, the bonus attachments that come with the deluxe model provide a more optimal performance.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and effective.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Easy to use and effective.&lt;br</li>
            <li>) Easy to use.  </li>
            <li>The clean up is so easy, and it makes me feel better about being sanitary.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Just make sure to clean after each use.</li>
            <li>Between all the epilators I went through the years, this is by far the absolute best.</li>
            <li>This works quite well, charges very quickly, and can be used cordless or when plugged in.  </li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s easy now.</li>
            <li>Easy to hold and maneuver&lt;</li>
            <li>The head is easy to remove/rinse.  </li>
            <li>That is easy to confirm while removing hairs by both.</li>
            <li>It comes with a travel bag for easy carrying.</li>
            <li>In my opinion, this hurts a lot more than waxing, but it does a great job, and the hair takes forever to grow back.  </li>
            <li>The motor is strong and does not yield to stubborn hairs.</li>
            <li>My old one worked okay, but it took dozens of passes, and a good hour, to get my lower legs done.  </li>
            <li>I would strongly discourage from using it on the face.</li>
            <li>Very fast &amp; effective.</li>
            <li>I skimmed most of it, but kept having to try look things up to make sure I was doing it right</li>
            <li>I skimmed most of it, but kept having to try look things up to make sure I was doing it right</li>
            <li>The fact you can use this with the cord, which is super long, is wonderful!  </li>
            <li>It is like waxing, in terms of the removal results, but without the ongoing cost, AND more importantly, the ability to clean up strays in between.  </li>
            <li>Works best for underarms, less painfull than wax for underarms also very quick,   Hurts for bikini area.   </li>
            <li>Spending a bit more money with the deluxe model will grant you a few bonuses, but the product works really well by itself (Philips HP6576/60 Satin Perfect Epilator).</li>
            <li>When it&#x27;s plugged in it works fine</li>
            <li>It hurt the first time i did it but gets more and more tolerable.</li>
            <li>I have baby fine hair, so I don&#x27;t have any pain.</li>
            <li>/&gt;i have owned a philips epilator for 12 years and is still working fine.</li>
            <li>I also used the shaver head which works fine</li>
            <li>It is easy to use and comfortable to hold.</li>
            <li>The trimming head works fine.</li>
            <li>I must not have read the fine print.</li>
            <li>This epilator works fine.</li>
            <li>so you can see the fine hairs.</li>
            <li>Downside is it doesn&#x27;t get the fine hairs.</li>
            <li>Some quick math would show that you probably spend about $130 or more a year on those.</li>
            <li>I like it because it is so quick and feels better.</li>
            <li>More of a mild irritation.  </li>
            <li>your legs really do feel smoother and look more satiny!</li>
            <li>VERY WELL, LOVE THE ITEM, RECOMMEND IT !</li>
            <li>They are easy to remove and fairly easy to clean.</li>
            <li>After reading several positive reviews, I decided to give the Philips Shave Perfect a try.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Another bonus that comes with the deluxe model is the Illuminating Smart Tweezers.</li>
            <li>I have had my Philips satin perfect epilator for a little longer than a month.</li>
            <li>But with the shorter course hairs,I was impressed at how little growth I needed to grab them by the root&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>Very easy to use, and again build in light, very helpful!</li>
            <li>The product is environmentally friendly, saves time, and will pay for itself very quickly.  </li>
            <li>I opened the tube to find a micro mirror perfect for on the go tweezing and then I flipped the little LED light on.</li>
            <li>Great epilator, works very good on legs, and I love the little light, it actually shows me the spots I missed.</li>
            <li>I have owned and tried dozens of these machines for the past 15 years and this one is by far the best - easiest to use and clean, smooth results and works great on legs, bikini line and arm pits :</li>
            <li>Then as it warmed in my hand, it stuck to my leg and gave me a HUGE bruise when I tried pull it off.</li>
            <li>It was a huge improvement over the cheaper epilator (Bliss spa) that I owned before.</li>
            <li>, it is a huge benefit to have the trimming option.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Finally, pain greatly diminishes on subsequent uses because there are fewer hairs each time you epilate.  </li>
            <li>Fantastic.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe how smooth my legs feel</li>
            <li>Also, this would replace all those cheap disposable razors you buy at Target.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t care how much pain I have to get used to, this thing is amazing.</li>
            <li>The primary use for this product is epilation, i.e. uprooting of the hairs, which is done by tweezer-like rotating disks.</li>
            <li>I can honestly say that the massagers vibrating really took away from a lot of the pain.</li>
            <li>For under the arms, unless you are in front of a mirror, a light would not be as beneficial.  </li>
            <li>There is a set of tweezers that are included that contain a mirror and also a light.  </li>
            <li>I got smooth look.</li>
            <li>, it was almost like I never had smooth legs.</li>
            <li>Another thing I like is that you can use this while it is charging (great option actually) just can&#x27;t get it wet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Smooth...</li>
            <li>It just feels like my skin is being lightly scratched.</li>
            <li>Use an alcohol free lotion or antiseptic after using to soothe skin.  </li>
            <li>and I like the added feature of the light because it makes it easier to see hairs that I&#x27;ve missed.</li>
            <li>Now, enjoy those smooth legs for a week or two.  </li>
            <li>Another important thing for me was the ability to use it while it is plugged in.</li>
            <li>Thanks Philips for this amazing Epilator.</li>
            <li>Comfortable design,</li>
            <li>It works amazingly and doesn&#x27;t hurt as much a s</li>
            <li>can I have a free service to repair it?</li>
            <li>And honestly for me,  I would much rather endure an hour of discomfort than have to shave every morning in the shower.  </li>
            <li>They look completely smooth, and fantastic.  </li>
            <li>I also like the guiding light on it.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s not going to be pain free.  </li>
            <li>very noisy but really effective.</li>
            <li>And honestly I don&#x27;t even really care for the epilator attachment to this.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean</li>
            <li>When I woke up I had amazingly smooth legs.  </li>
            <li>The epilator body is comfortable to manipulate.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s implied that the hair is pulled out so the area will be smooth.</li>
            <li>but I felt that having it over faster was important as I&#x27;m a pain wimp.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for the upper lip too.  </li>
            <li>and my daughter loves the light up tweezers.</li>
            <li>The plus of this is it&#x27;s light and comfortable to hold.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>Easy to clean detachable heads.</li>
            <li>The light does help to find stubborn hairs</li>
            <li>I use it weekly just to keep my legs smooth</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t sit here and say it&#x27;s pain free...</li>
            <li>The shape is ergonomic and the light is helpful.  </li>
            <li>It does not bother me since I am not using it while my family watching a movie or doing homework or something.&lt;br /&gt;Design: comfortable to hold and light.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Skin feels smooth.</li>
            <li>liked the idea of ceramic disks and thought that sounded like a modern option as well.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy it and it doesn&#x27;t hurt at all.</li>
            <li>Everywhere that I epilated feels silky smooth now.</li>
            <li>The shape of the product fits comfortably in my hand.</li>
            <li>It does sound like a weed whacker, which I guess it is.  </li>
            <li>It is absolutely one of my most favorite scents.</li>
            <li>Immediately loved the difference of these disks versus the &amp;#34;tweezer&amp;#34; style of my old one.  </li>
            <li>Although this epilator did receive a lot of good reviews, some of the recent reviews made me think twice about spending more than $50 dollars on this product.</li>
            <li>The features and attachments are really cool and the bag and tweezers  are really cool too :)</li>
            <li>Skin feels so nice and smooth for much longer than after razor.</li>
            <li>Having only used this one, all I can say is this one is super nice in every way except that it hurts like crazy.wk...)  13) Seems very safe.  </li>
            <li>My leg hair grows about has fast as my husbands 5&#x27;oclock shadow, so I was very excited about the ability to not have to shave my legs every morning (something I feel like I spend a greater part of my week doing).&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Ok, then it also comes with a very smart tweezers with a led light too.</li>
            <li>More convenient than waxing with all the positive effects!</li>
            <li>It barely hurts my armpits but it still isn&#x27;t pleasant on my bikini area.</li>
            <li>There are a total of 4 attachments, each of which comes very handy.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t expect to use it on your face, however, as the facial hair removal touted is for the very nice, lighted tweezers included in the set.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think this epilator is as thorough as the earlier model, but it is still very effective.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s best if you use this every other day and get the right touch.</li>
            <li>Then (I really love this part), a pretty battery shaped light will be lit on the front of the epilator.</li>
            <li>so they&#x27;re super easy to carry in your purse.</li>
            <li>/&gt;You can do armpits and legs in a heartbeat, super easy.</li>
            <li>new model hurts much more!</li>
            <li>The force/strength/power is the same when urged in or just charged, it is amazing!</li>
            <li>If I knew that it would be so great I had bought it a long time</li>
            <li>This is a unique feature that this shaver has.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Talking about just the epilator though, this one works better than my first one (emjoi caress or something like that.)  </li>
            <li>Definitely worth buying!</li>
            <li>And if you have waxed than you are familiar with the idea that you get use to this</li>
            <li>I tried other brands and models, but this one is really good!</li>
            <li>used the first time a couple days a go, and I am in love with it</li>
            <li>effect is much better that the cutter.&lt;br /&gt;Though it will cause a bit pain at the first time when using it.</li>
            <li>I was really excited upon ordering this epilator.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m sorta excited to do it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure the first time will be painful.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I like pretty things :)</li>
            <li>I was really excited to get this epilator through BzzAgent.com.</li>
            <li>If they could get rid of the \\&quot;yank\\&quot; when the hair is pulled it would be perfect (not sure how an engineer could design that though).</li>
            <li>The tweezers have a built-in light, which is cool.</li>
            <li>because i need this thing long time, and it is great.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s seriously worth it!</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the purchase!</li>
            <li>and I fell in love after the first use.</li>
            <li>The &#x27;grab&#x27; is very strong, so that&#x27;s good for removing the hairs, but be careful as it really hurts (more than a weaker grab epilator)</li>
            <li>I made sure my legs were clean and after using I took a hot shower and lathered up my legs with lotion before going to bed.  </li>
            <li>new model is not as effective removing hair.</li>
            <li>Quickly removes hair and the attachments are super cool!</li>
            <li>I do like the light as the emjoi doesn&#x27;t, but the overall performance I felt was not as good as I thought it would be.</li>
            <li>X&#x27;elle Body System Epilator]] which has metal disks that tear and damage your skin - thus I still had to wax some parts, which kinda defeats the purpose of owning an epilator for a quick and cheap at-home hair removal.  </li>
            <li>Brush - Used to clean your epilator after each use.   </li>
            <li>you want super smooth.  </li>
            <li>you want super smooth.  </li>
            <li>Can get most even now with an extra pass or a circle motion, but honestly those missed you can&#x27;t see</li>
            <li>clean look.  </li>
            <li>Just clean as instructed.</li>
            <li>It just arrived yesterday (a day early in fact), so I have only used it once, but I am very happy with this purchase and would buy again.</li>
            <li>suggest if at all possible to use weekly - the longer the hair the more apt to have a prickly feeling</li>
            <li>Just pop the head off like the directions say and it rinses clean in seconds.</li>
            <li>The head and attachments come apart and you can run them all under water to clean them.</li>
            <li>It takes me about 20 seconds to clean everything, then I set the pieces out to air-dry overnight.</li>
            <li>The bag it comes with to hold everything is super cheap.</li>
            <li>Love this Epilator omg so much better than my old one</li>
            <li>Upon first use I was pretty positive that instead of pulling hair it was pulling skin, but the nice thing about this product is when you pop off the top to clean it</li>
            <li>I read the reviews and most of them were positive, I decided to get one, and I just SO GRAEAT.</li>
            <li>I love it from the firs &amp;#34;view&amp;#34; and bc of a lot positive feedback .</li>
            <li>First of all, I was very lucky to have been sent this product to try for free from BzzAgent.  </li>
            <li>the rest (shaver, tweezer, etc) is very nice, I still like it as a shaver and will keep trying the epilator a few more times...</li>
            <li>the rest (shaver, tweezer, etc) is very nice, I still like it as a shaver and will keep trying the epilator a few more times...</li>
            <li>The shaver with the guard on it is very handy to get the hairs to the optimum length for the epilator head, especially when I wait a bit too long between sessions.</li>
            <li>I was expecting pain and torture along with bright red legs for hours and hours.</li>
            <li>Now let me just say, compared to my old 30$ Braun metal disc epilator, this one is amazing.</li>
            <li>- it&#x27;s a spinning head of tiny tweezers pulling out each hair at the root - did you expect it to feel good?  </li>
            <li>I find myself using it so much because it has so many functions.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never actually used an electric shaver before and found it to be surprisingly convenient.</li>
            <li>The Cool Fix Gel Lotion - 2 oz]].</li>
            <li>But to be hair free for 1-2 weeks is well worth it.</li>
            <li>Okay I was now prepped and ready.    </li>
            <li>I used this product regularly for a month to give it a fair shake</li>
            <li>this is smaller but fairly comparable in function.  </li>
            <li>It is fast, doesn&#x27;t require more than one pass (depending on amount of hair of course)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does</li>
            <li>After a week or two, you&#x27;ll notice some short hairs starting to poke out and ruin that wonderful smooth leg experience.  </li>
            <li>A good epilator will last you for years.  </li>
            <li>A full charge should give you 40 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it comes with a lot of attachments and a cool lighted tweeter and mirror compact.</li>
            <li>its cool.</li>
            <li>it works and its not painful.</li>
            <li>two was easier, as I think I was more ready for the pain than anything.</li>
            <li>a good charge, definitely enough to do both legs</li>
            <li>Good thing is that you can use it while charging (opposite to Braun epilator).</li>
            <li>This is true, after a couple weeks I was no longer sweating and shaking and stopping every 30 seconds while using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d probably use a cool pack after I do it, but the pinkness goes away after a couple of hours.</li>
            <li>I think this is the only good point of this product.</li>
            <li>The ceramic heads grab the hair very well, and do not cause as many ingrowns as metal heads I have used.</li>
            <li>I love that it runs off a battery making it much easier to operate.</li>
            <li>It does a good job but needs several times of application for a neat spot.</li>
            <li>I used the shaver in the armpits, which has a nice close shave, but I couldn&#x27;t get it to reach the area near my tendon, so I still have to use a razor there.  </li>
            <li>Since it arrived I have only used it once and was really good.</li>
            <li>but I still charged it completely before I did my own legs.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not bad at all.</li>
            <li>For the first time, go easy, work in segments so that you can see progress -- take your time.  </li>
            <li>A friend let me try her older version, which she swore by... and while &amp;#34;uncomfortable&amp;#34; at first, it&#x27;s much more easy and bearable than plucking a full face of hairs here and there with tweezers each week at the minimum for me, which also hurts.</li>
            <li>The &amp;#34;pain&amp;#34; level is tons lower with this-to the point I might brave trying areas other than my legs.  </li>
            <li>I have another epilators from emjoi that works a little better, but wanted to try this one as the reviews were so good.  </li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t have a lot of hair, or it&#x27;s pretty fine</li>
            <li>The next one I buy, I&#x27;ll make sure it does a better job of pulling the hair out rather then breaking it.  </li>
            <li>More than enough power on the epilator for sure</li>
            <li>Really the whole thing just looks nice.  </li>
            <li>but you get used to it quickly.</li>
            <li>It is painless, works quickly, don&#x27;t have to fight with a cord.</li>
            <li>Charges quickly.  </li>
            <li>Easy to clean and a plug in recharger that charges fast.  </li>
            <li>Forty minutes are adequate.  </li>
            <li>It seemed the hair had to be the perfect length, and all my hair doesn&#x27;t grow at the same rate so this was not possible.</li>
            <li>Plus, I still haven&#x27;t tried doing a super exfoliation beforehand, maybe that will help as well?</li>
            <li>so I can get it over with as quickly as possible.&lt;br /&gt;4.</li>
            <li>finally chose the Philips Satin Perfect simply based on the fact that it looked the classiest, ha!&lt;br</li>
            <li>finally chose the Philips Satin Perfect simply based on the fact that it looked the classiest, ha!&lt;br</li>
            <li>This epilator is great - works fast, doesn&#x27;t break hair - pulls them out properly and works for about 45 min without charging.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great in that the area stays smoother for so much longer, plus the hair is thinner and grows back slower.</li>
            <li>If anyone has ever plucked their eyebrows, it feels like that sting but then quickly goes away.</li>
            <li>The fact that has so many and different heads and that it&#x27;s wireless makes it even better.</li>
            <li>only way more than one at a time, more like one after another after another in rapid</li>
            <li>Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Quick and Efficient</li>
            <li>These gloves are available at a very reasonable price on amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and if you ever used one of this epilators before you will find this one no painful at all... i use it on my legs, bikini and underarms with no problem, is very fast, the light really helps and the cleaning is super easy.</li>
            <li>Very accurate and efficient, charge lasts long time and led light makes it easy to use.</li>
            <li>The OptiLight allows you to see even the tiniest and lightest hairs(which is great for me because I have dark hair.)</li>
            <li>And exactly like what it would sound like, you will run the risk of damaging something.</li>
            <li>the kind that never fold back as nice as they were before you unfolded it like an unruly old style map.&lt;br /&gt;3) Can pop the head off while it&#x27;s in use.  </li>
            <li>the kind that never fold back as nice as they were before you unfolded it like an unruly old style map.  </li>
            <li>The epilator itself is very pretty, and the attachments all have a use.</li>
            <li>This one is very pretty and good-looking, but breaks off the hairs.</li>
            <li>/&gt;You should be aware that this does not give you a perfectly smooth silky leg like a razor</li>
            <li>First, the tweezer comes with a built in light, but mine didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>this is my favorite especially being cordless with a light And flexible head.the light up tweezers</li>
            <li>The unit itself also has a light on it, which really helps in the spa with subdued lighting!</li>
            <li>For hair that may be too long for optimum epilating, the trimming attachment could be used.</li>
            <li>The battery lasts quite well, it&#x27;s good for as long as I can go at it at a time and the charge indicator is well done.</li>
            <li>It comes with 3 different epilating attachments and a razor head with a trimmer, as well as a great cleaning brush and awesome light-up tweezers and everything fits in the little white bag that it comes with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!!ey, but you will get more than your moneys worth with this.  </li>
            <li>I have this epilator for 1 year now, and it has some real pros: lithium battery which makes it wireless and usable anywhere and a very very useful led light that points to the right spot of your skin when removing the hairs.</li>
            <li>I bought this new version and found out it is getting better.</li>
            <li>I just love this new version.</li>
            <li>I have been epilating for many years now and wanted to try something new.  </li>
            <li>The new one works even better.  </li>
            <li>This product was good only for the first weeks.</li>
            <li>This epilator even grabs very short hairs and is just perfect since you don&#x27;t have to wait too long for the hair to grow out.</li>
            <li>It is fast, easy and gets the job done.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t hurt much the first time either, and the results are fantastic!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s thorough, easy to use, sleek, and appears to be very well built.  </li>
            <li>I especially like that this tool has a light on it to make it easy to see fine hairs.</li>
            <li>my first thought was Ouch!</li>
            <li>BUT IT HURTS A LOT, REALLY HURTS!!</li>
            <li>Overall the unit is stylish, easy to use, ergonomically designed.  </li>
            <li>by.&lt;br /&gt;The lighted tweezers included with this deluxe set helped my husband quickly find &amp; remove a tiny metal</li>
            <li>It has super speed and light, and you can use it on your bathtub which is very convenient.</li>
            <li>I pulls out the finer, smaller hair more easily as compared to speed</li>
            <li>I would love this product more if it got the super short hairs, really it&#x27;s stubble.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll admit that in an area where you can stand to use it, the epilator does a fantastic job of leaving behind a very smooth surface...nearly as good as waxing.  </li>
            <li>The sound that comes out of this little guy is so surprisingly that it scared me to use it.</li>
            <li>Since the epilator has an LED light on it, I was able to spot most of the little hairs that maybe I would have missed otherwise.</li>
            <li>My Braun epilator I used to have was about 30 dollars, so fairly cheap, this one not so much.</li>
            <li>This product worked great for a few weeks.</li>
            <li>this is a great solution to wanting those non hairy legs and not having the time or desire to shave each morning or even every few days.  </li>
            <li>and i really like the light.</li>
            <li>The different heads and attachments are a nice addition, and I think they may be helpful to someone who is more sensitive to the pain.</li>
            <li>hairs!&lt;br /&gt;-I&#x27;m not so much of a fan of the light.</li>
            <li>real, real improvement!&lt;br /&gt;Why?&lt;br</li>
            <li>the built in light is also very helpful.  </li>
            <li>Definitely not painLESS but effective.</li>
            <li>The ol&#x27; razor blade wins again.</li>
            <li>feel that some people would not care about this, but I think it something worth mentioning.</li>
            <li>The white bag is really handy.</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;m not convinced that that shave is worth the price</li>
            <li>Worth the purchase.</li>
            <li>Now the fun part</li>
            <li>The two main heads were easy to put on, however, it took some getting used to in order to add the massage rollers.  </li>
            <li>Again, useful for seeing hairs that may be missed.  </li>
            <li>, it is a well designed and useful shaver.</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t speak yet to how it holds up over time, but so far I am pleased.  </li>
            <li>Overall this product is really nice in what it is supposed to do.</li>
            <li>just so it looks more natural.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quite powerful and has two speeds.  </li>
            <li>That aspect alone is well worth the price difference for me.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
            <li>, din&#x27;t shave for a month to get them waxes in the spa, but even they make fun of me.</li>
            <li>this is worth every penny you spend.</li>
            <li>nice to carry around in your purse for last min touch ups.</li>
            <li>And if I am going to endure this kind of pain, than I want to do it as inexpensively as possible.  </li>
            <li>The accessories that come with it are really useful.</li>
            <li>It is worth the pain.</li>
            <li>It’s worth it.</li>
            <li>With no pain, the price is worth it.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t worth the money.</li>
            <li>But that&#x27;s pulling out years worth of growth.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Tweezer they gave is nice, but not necessary</li>
            <li>And completely worth it when it negates all those parlor visits for waxing.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It comes with these incredible mirror/flashlight/tweezers, but then they give you the flimsiest, most useless piece of fabric to hold it all in.</li>
            <li>but i do not think it would be worth paying 100 dollars for.</li>
            <li>IMO, worth it.</li>
            <li>but it is worth...</li>
            <li>Worth the money</li>
            <li>In the old model the heads were/are metallic and the rotation movement was/is more soft.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Its worth every penny I spend on it.</li>
            <li>So far, I love it.  </li>
            <li>: it&#x27;s an epilator, it hurts, because it pulls your hairs and specially in most sensitive areas (under arms and bikini area).</li>
            <li>Thought of trying the advertised wonder hair remover that&#x27;s advertised every hour on tv but didn&#x27;t think it was worth the $200 price tag.  </li>
            <li>If I could have withstood the pain, it would be worth it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quite powerful and has two speeds.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>It seems to maneuver better than my old one.  </li>
            <li>Better than my old one.  </li>
            <li>The multiple heads give a more comfortable shave.</li>
            <li>The trimmer is worth it if you don&#x27;t feel like ripping your hair off one day or just want to do some touch ups.  </li>
            <li>In fact, after the first time, it&#x27;s really not bad at all.  </li>
            <li>I plan to continue using this wonderful little device, especially considering how clean it leaves my legs.</li>
            <li>I do love that there is no mess.</li>
            <li>I basically remove *all* the visible hair below my waist line, and this thing is very friendly to the sensitive areas, since it has ceramic disks.</li>
            <li>Always works much better than waxing and there is  no mess afterwards</li>
            <li>From other girls who have used this products, they told me that the more you use it, the more you get used to.</li>
            <li>I would probably never use the epilator on the pits but it&#x27;s good on other areas</li>
            <li>I would probably never use the epilator on the pits but it&#x27;s good on other areas</li>
            <li>Ouch it hurts so much, but it is worth, it takes 3 weeks for hair to grow!</li>
            <li>(if I am already epilating this is a pain) and look at the front to see if I am in the right speed setting.</li>
            <li>started on the bottom of my right leg, and yes, it did hurt some.</li>
            <li>has this product on sale right now, which was why I bought it</li>
            <li>Amazon has this product on sale right now, which was why I bought it</li>
            <li>Yep, it hurt, but I thought, maybe there&#x27;s something I&#x27;m not doing quite right.</li>
            <li>They are sending out the part right away.</li>
            <li>You can hear the hairs being caught when you&#x27;re doing it right.</li>
            <li>I find the &amp;#34;discomfort&amp;#34; level pretty ignorable on my arms and legs, but problematic on more sensitive areas like my belly.</li>
            <li>The Philips is much easier to clean.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s in a little lipstick like tube and has a super bright LED for plucking.  </li>
            <li>This Satin Perfect Epilator, however it&#x27;s different than others, (maybe the fact that the discs are ceramic instead of metal?) has not been causing that problem in the month and a half I&#x27;ve been using it.  </li>
            <li>May not have to do an epilator as often but took more total time than a quick shave with a razor every day.  </li>
            <li>I had another very old Philips Epilator and, in comparison, this one so much faster and more convenient/ easier to use because it&#x27;s cordless.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;d use it all the time, but with the really bright light and ability to shave dry, I could really see the usefulness for when one needs a quick clean up on the legs or pits but doesn&#x27;t have time to properly hop in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you have used epilators in the past and are looking for an upgrade, this is a great device.</li>
            <li>love the light on the epilator, really helps at getting at the smaller hairs&lt;br /&gt;Holds</li>
            <li>I have light colored hair and its also not terribly thick.</li>
            <li>The long cord on the charger comes in handy depending on where your electrical outlets are placed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Nice storage bag holds everything including the long cord.  </li>
            <li>Honestly, in the pictures of those epilators they look like some sort of strange torture devices.</li>
            <li>Seemed to work better with a very light touch then firmly pressed against the skin.  </li>
            <li>It did slightly hurt on the first use, but does get better with more use.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s true that hurts a lot using it, but the result is worth all the pain: my arms and legs are so soft!!</li>
            <li>Definitely more comfortable than expected.  </li>
            <li>have experienced some ingrown hairs that present like tiny pimples.  </li>
            <li>(I think a good wet/dry shaver alone costs less than this device).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Light is actually more helpful than I expected.</li>
            <li>I had had the same epilator for years and it worked great, that´s way I decided to buy the same one.</li>
            <li>Epilator is not for everyone, but if you can stomach the pain, you do not have to waste money on many many</li>
            <li>Also, what I noticed is that it&#x60;s way lighter than my previous epilators which is good for me because I travel a lot.</li>
            <li>Plus, you have to warm the wax up so often, it&#x27;s really takes an entire afternoon to do your legs!</li>
            <li>What I like about this epilator is that it&#x60;s cordless,includes razor head, has a good opti-light,four attachments and a pair of illuminating smart tweezers in a nice white little bag.</li>
            <li>Very loud Even the shaver attachment just &amp;#34;trims&amp;#34; it by no means leaves you smooth...</li>
            <li>okay this seems to be getting a little more tolerable with the occasional pulls hurting more than others.</li>
            <li>It works a lot better, pulls really small hairs and is easy to clean.</li>
            <li>I like it very much.</li>
            <li>and that is very fast.</li>
            <li>First of all, using just one button for everything will wear down the epilator more easily.</li>
            <li>in a little lipstick like tube and has a bright LED for plucking.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little pricey, but it does a good job so for me</li>
            <li>Seems to do a good job with little pain.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use, the battery autonomy is better than the previous model</li>
            <li>I bought this as a replacement for an older model phillips, love it so far.  </li>
            <li>The strong grab is what I like though, less ingrowns (also do use a scratchy pad to exfoliate in the shower every day) and quicker, better hair removal.</li>
            <li>It is exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li>FIRST, let me say that the first time you use this, IT WILL HURT.  </li>
            <li>Before the first use, I let the hair on my legs grow out quite a bit and then trimmed with the included shaver head to the suggested length for optimal epilation (in the instruction manual).  </li>
            <li>I wish I had bought this one in the first place.  </li>
            <li>The epilator hasn&#x27;t slipped from my hands yet during epilating, but an actual grip would provide better security.</li>
            <li>Even in a well-lit room, the OptiLight never fails to impress me.</li>
            <li>The packaging of the tweezers is okay, but not terrific.</li>
            <li>The thing I am most worried about is the actual epilator.</li>
            <li>I will most likely use the pouch for the attachments and the charger, and will probably use a separate makeup bag to storemy epilator.</li>
            <li>She uses it several times a week, and we&#x27;re already saving money not having to purchase so many razors and shaving accessories.</li>
            <li>Worked very well for me.&lt;br /&gt;Accesories make the difference!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t often have to charge it, and if for some reason I do have to charge while in use, the cord is pretty long.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>I recommend using the trim attachment first to leave the hair a uniform length before using the epilator, if you have it.</li>
            <li>That may seem like a lot at first</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need to sit in a very well lit place to touch up your brows anymore!</li>
            <li>My first reaction was \\&quot;Holy</li>
            <li>That may scare anyone off at first</li>
            <li>My old one didn&#x27;t have a light</li>
            <li>In all honesty epilating will hurt at first.  </li>
            <li>Showering or taking a hot bath beforehand makes all the difference in the world.  </li>
            <li>I chose to use the Optimal Performance Cap since this was my first time ever using an epilator.</li>
            <li>First pass</li>
            <li>shaving attachment was awesome--at first.</li>
            <li>Although this one does incorporate the same technique of pulling the hair from the root, it does it with a lot more comfort and ease.  </li>
            <li>I tried it on my legs, I started using it while it was charging for the first time, convenient.</li>
            <li>It pulls out majority of hair on first pass.</li>
            <li>but sometimes it is getting to hot when I&#x27;m using that</li>
            <li>This is the first epilator I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li>It is waaay faster than my old cheap brand epilator</li>
            <li>They sounded like machines created by the devil himself, but I was willing to try it.</li>
            <li>I love the different attachments, and the tweezers.</li>
            <li>: I forgot to mention this the first time I posted my review.  </li>
            <li>As much as I&#x27;d like to reserve it for eyebrows, the sucker is a great tweezer and just seems so darn useful</li>
            <li>Even though I&#x27;m most likely to use this as a shaver, I like that the epilator is an option.  </li>
            <li>it was pretty intuitive.  </li>
            <li>Hot shower beforehand doesn&#x27;t help either.  </li>
            <li>Hot shower beforehand doesn&#x27;t help either.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t hurt at all after the first time.</li>
            <li>First ever epilator</li>
            <li>It hurts at first</li>
            <li>The amount of pain that an epilator will cause you is directly related to how many hairs it&#x27;s yanking out.  </li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s pretty neat that you can use the device for both shaving and epilating.  </li>
            <li>Decided to try something more fancy but regretted it, for some reason it doesn&#x27;t come close enough and leaves all the roots.</li>
            <li>shaver attachment is pretty nifty.  </li>
            <li>I really need one!</li>
            <li>Bought this as a replacement to a different manufacturer/model after reading many of the reviews.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend!!</li>
            <li>It is my first epilator purchase, so there has been a trial and error period in my learning curve.</li>
            <li>But also i love the shaver attachment if you cant deal with the pain like me on my upper thighs and arms</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s no worse!</li>
            <li>will, but unless you are rubbing your hands (or your sweetheart is) up your leg, you would not know your legs aren&#x27;t completely razor smooth.  </li>
            <li>the first time.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Takes pass after pass to get most of the hair so not a quicker alternative to daily shaving.  </li>
            <li>The first day using it on my underarms</li>
            <li>It is exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>Also, by being wireless, it makes it so much easier to use!</li>
            <li>Very efficient machine!</li>
            <li>It was my first epilator I ever used</li>
            <li>so nicely surprised about the light, and now my husband start to use it.....</li>
            <li>I love the no cord feature - after charging it is enough for legs/bikini areas for about 5-8 times (of course it depends on the hairiness).</li>
            <li>I love that in this one you can take the &amp;#34;head&amp;#34; off and actually wash it!</li>
            <li>My first night of use with this product did not go so well.</li>
            <li>Yes, the first time you use it, it hurts.</li>
            <li>I thought, hmm, when I tweeze, I grab the hair pretty close to the skin, not at the end... and maybe that&#x27;s what wasn&#x27;t happening with the epilator.</li>
            <li>(BTW, those lighted tweezers are pretty</li>
            <li>DO NOT expect that your legs, or whatever, will be completely hair free for up to 4 weeks.  </li>
            <li>decreases after the first epilation&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>It has many different uses.  </li>
            <li>It takes multiple passes to remove most of the hair in an area.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>I would definitely suggest waxing the area a couple times first to determine whether you&#x27;ll be able to handle the pain and get an idea of the frequency with which you&#x27;ll have to put yourself through that pain.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is the first epilator I&#x27;ve owned with all-plastic &amp;#34;tweezers&amp;#34;, all others were metal &amp;#34;tweezers&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>and this was my first one.</li>
            <li>This was the first time I used or purchased an epilator.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so maybe my pain tolerance is higher than others maybe not.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s so pretty.  </li>
            <li>I get 2 full sessions in each time before re-charging anyway, but if the orange light comes on while I&#x27;m in the middle of a leg</li>
            <li>I&#x60;ve used so many different epilators - \\&quot;Emjoi Emagine Tweezer - Head</li>
            <li>anyone who&#x27;s considering this Philips epilator should understand exactly what it is.</li>
            <li>I use light circular motions and direct the heads against the hair growth.</li>
            <li>This hurts, but it really works!</li>
            <li>I love all the extra attachments too.</li>
            <li>So I needed a more efficient method and recently got this epilator.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Overall, it&#x27;s a great buy, I hope it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>but I thought getting a more expensive one with more features would work even better.</li>
            <li>The first time you probably should plan to do it on a weekend with nothing else going on.</li>
            <li>My first one lasted me 10 years.</li>
            <li>Overall I am pleased with the product.</li>
            <li>It got hot -but not too hot-</li>
            <li>It also had that \\&quot;hot machine\\&quot;</li>
            <li>time I would follow my gut feeling and get the one I like or think will like and not entirely based on reviews :)</li>
            <li>one thing really annoys me: I can&#x27;t stand model regression in any product!</li>
            <li>The old model with a battery and a light would be a</li>
            <li>And if you keep it there more than necessary it will scratch your skin!</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t lie, I was sweating the first time I used it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had many different epilators before and this one just didn&#x27;t cut it.</li>
            <li>If you never used epilator before, try twiners first in each area where you think you will use an epilator, it will give you an idea.</li>
            <li>I have had too many to count and if they get infected, do not wait to seek a topical antibiotic.</li>
            <li>This is my first epilator...</li>
            <li>This is my first time using an epilator, and I read all the reviews before buying it...</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m a pretty hairy girl).</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t have any of the redness that I lot of people have described after epilating for the first time.</li>
            <li>The style attachment it comes with is great for delicate areas.</li>
            <li>My first epilator.</li>
            <li>This was the first epilator that I&#x27;ve used or purchased.</li>
            <li>Love the extra Shaver Head&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Sure we have to use an adaptor but that is simple.</li>
            <li>The first one I had that did.</li>
            <li>I had waxed under arms a week ago and had few hairs growing which came out without any pain surprisingly.</li>
            <li>have been waxing off and on for a few years and just didn&#x27;t want to shave again after a good 3 months of waxing.  </li>
            <li>Saves time, money and my legs look great longer with very little effort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Summer and shorts here we come!</li>
            <li>The only reason I know it is missing some hairs is because of the super bright light.  </li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s no worse than waxing, and the pain goes away quickly, the result is much smoother than shaving.</li>
            <li>you have many other options that are far better and cheaper).  </li>
            <li>After use the area is very irritated, I do not suggest using this right before you throw of a bikini.</li>
            <li>After my first time epilating, my legs have been mostly stubble-free (my leg hair are really fine, so a few strands were cut instead of pulled out).</li>
            <li>liked that the different heads give you tons of options to use the product, and come in a nice little bag too!</li>
            <li>simple design, value for money, easy diy at home method, no mess technique, pain completely bearable against the results, handy pouch to store, smart tweezers come along</li>
            <li>It will pulse for certain duration and the light will disappear for the rest of the time, until after the epilator is completely charged.</li>
            <li>My favorite part is the little LED light on them.</li>
            <li>love the little light in it</li>
            <li>Blinks brightly while charging, turns off when done (well actually turns solid and then turns off after a while, but unless you&#x27;re watching it like a hawk...</li>
            <li>I also find that there is more hair pickup than without the attachment, so I don&#x27;t have to run my epilator over the same area as much.</li>
            <li>It give me severe rash and white spots and in the top of that, my legs were really itchy wen</li>
            <li>and I imagine that would be more so in more delicate parts of the body.</li>
            <li>My old Philips epilator is by far better than this one.</li>
            <li>After 2-1/2 years of elipating, most of my hairs are either coming back as baby fine blonde hairs or not at all.</li>
            <li>With Phillips ceramic discs it only takes once or sometimes 2 times to go over the area and it removes all the hairs even the most fine and short once.</li>
            <li>If you are super sensitive to having your hairs tweezed, this is probably not for you!</li>
            <li>when you pop off the top to clean it you can see all the little hairs in the bottom.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fast and really removes your hair!</li>
            <li>As I said earlier, I did receive this product for free, but I would gladly pay to replace it if necessary.</li>
            <li>I will for sure be more careful next time!</li>
            <li>I loved it, it does hurt a bit, but I usually wax</li>
            <li>My life is much easier now thanks to my new Philips Epilator!!!</li>
            <li>It is great for legs tough, just because it is fast!</li>
            <li>However, the charger should work, but you must first hear a big CLICK sound when you plug the cord into your epilator.</li>
            <li>The device cleans really easy and is simple to take apart and put together.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>: my first epilation didn&#x27;t leave my legs silky smooth, but that might be from some hairs being way way too short.</li>
            <li>I did use it when I first started out and gradually became comfortable enough not using it.  </li>
            <li>Easy to store in provided bag, not too big</li>
            <li>It is pretty powerful and not meant for sensitive skin like that on the face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would strongly recommend using this product following the epilator.</li>
            <li>The battery doesnt last a full leg session for me, but I am rarely away from a plug in.</li>
            <li>would strongly recommend it to anyone who has a lot of sudden plans and can&#x27;t always manage to get to the parlor in time.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this epilator for a little under 3 months and overall, I&#x27;m pretty happy.  </li>
            <li>It would have been smart to integrate a twist feature (like that of a water bottle) or a snap</li>
            <li>Certain alcohol-based deodorants may cause stinging and sometimes the technique can irritate the skin.</li>
            <li>I were smart</li>
            <li>and specially extra parts are very useful (she says) ;)</li>
            <li>When put side by side in the same area, the new model hurts definitely more.</li>
            <li>It charges fast and easily holds enough charge to do its job.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This has been in a box for about a week until I got brave enough to use it based on my past very brief excruciating experience with an epilady many years ago.  </li>
            <li>epilator comes with four different attachments for the fine to courser hair.</li>
            <li>The second one I received works and holds a charge fine.</li>
            <li>The second one works just fine.</li>
            <li>For the epilator, it works well, but I do have to take the guards off to reach the short fine hairs.  </li>
            <li>and the shaver seems pretty decent too.&lt;br /&gt;4)</li>
            <li>This epliator does a pretty decent job.</li>
            <li>OMG i have a very very high tolerance for pain</li>
            <li>/&gt;the epilator comes in its own little vanity bag where you can place the chargers, and its heads.</li>
            <li>Also, it really grabs the roots even the fine blonde hairs.</li>
            <li>I have a pretty high pain threshold</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s i little pricey, but you will get more than your moneys worth with this.  </li>
            <li>After a little bit of pain I would definitely recommend that you give the Philips Satin Perfect Epilator a try (only if you have some tolerance for pain).    </li>
            <li>It is best to epilate everyday for a few day so that the shorter hairs have time to grow out.</li>
            <li>This one seems to cause me the least amount of pain, but even more importantly, the fewest ingrown hairs.  </li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;-Hair doesn&#x27;t grow back as fast as shaving.&lt;br /&gt;-The tweezers with the light and mirror.</li>
            <li>this really works</li>
            <li>I was leery of doing to whole area in one go, so I did some.  </li>
            <li>The included shaver attachment works very well, so you could run the shaver over your legs after epilating if you need</li>
            <li>But get real</li>
            <li>I really, absolutely dislike the button.</li>
            <li>My dislike for the button does not really affect the epilator performance, but I think that feature could have been better thought out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>all, I like this product and will get much use from it.</li>
            <li>I would much rather just shave or wax.</li>
            <li>The pain on the legs is just too intense.</li>
            <li>part that she definitely likes is the razor attachment - it gives a nice, smooth shave without any trouble.</li>
            <li>Now let me say that I consider myself to be very tolerant of pain.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m very used to waxing, so the pain don&#x27;t bothers me at all.</li>
            <li>I was squinting my eyes in pain thinking \\&quot;really why torture yourself like this\\&quot;?</li>
            <li>I cannot stress enough how important exfoliating is.</li>
            <li>that was much shorter.  </li>
            <li>but really they do nothing to ease the epilator for me.  </li>
            <li>real gem here is the shaver though.  </li>
            <li>As much as it pulls hair out my understanding is that epilation lasts a lot longer like waxing.  </li>
            <li>It is indeed much smoother I can attest.  </li>
            <li>You can figure it out yourself very easily.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very understandable charging indicators.  </li>
            <li>but it seems like a real</li>
            <li>As much as I like the tweezer</li>
            <li>what I have done with it looks very nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but it seems like a real possibility.  </li>
            <li>As much as I like the tweezer</li>
            <li>- so really long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>cause it really didn&#x27;t hurt much at all.&lt;br</li>
            <li>After receiving this through Buzzagent.com, I was really exited to use this.</li>
            <li>What it does, it does well: removes hair from the folicle level very well.</li>
            <li>It works really well.</li>
            <li>Very</li>
            <li>you have waxed your entire life, this pain may not be that unbearable, but if you are primarily a shaving type of girl like me, boy does it hurt!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it has one head for shaving, for the time when the pain becomes too much and you just want to shave as well as messaging heads.</li>
            <li>I really like this.  </li>
            <li>very smooth.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Ingrown hairs are a real issue once you do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really like this epilator</li>
            <li>I a very hairy woman.</li>
            <li>Warning light when battery is getting low</li>
            <li>This epilator works really well.</li>
            <li>This epilator really doesn&#x27;t work well.</li>
            <li>5 mins later i&#x27;m stubble free.</li>
            <li>The shaving attachment works really well</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product to anyone who hates shaving, and just wants a &amp;#34;one and done&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I really like this hair remover machine</li>
            <li>but it works very well.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really think it woud help as much as it does.  </li>
            <li>I used it very genteelly  as the instruction mentioned.</li>
            <li>long, it grabs just fine and is less apt to break the hair off.  </li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this epilator</li>
            <li>Better than I expected.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall the epilator is well made and seems to function very well.</li>
            <li>haven&#x27;t tried the shaver head, I much prefer to use a blade razor.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t remove all hairs and even it hurts so much.</li>
            <li>its depends on how much you can take pain and how much you are used to it.</li>
            <li>also fast, painless, two speeds, tweezers are so often set up.</li>
            <li>With epilator the hair does not grow fast and in some places just stops growing altogether.</li>
            <li>It is kind of loud, I have to up the volume on tv quite a bit to hear it over epilator, but at least I can do it with something on (unlike old epilator).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Phillips makes fantastic products!</li>
            <li>This really amazed me.</li>
            <li>This way, you can pluck out the hairs on your whole face anywhere there is hair.&lt;br /&gt;She</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I really like this; given the chance for a do-over, I&#x27;d buy it again.</li>
            <li>It really is a help.  </li>
            <li>That is really misleading.  </li>
            <li>, even very slowly&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would much rather do this at home than have to go to a waxing salon every 3 weeks.</li>
            <li>Very efficient&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This item is very usefull.  </li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t plan on using that part very often.  </li>
            <li>and I need my epilator to be ready when I am.</li>
            <li>For this price, you should really get a nicer case.</li>
            <li>Still very costly and time-consuming, and still no long-term results.</li>
            <li>I spent many hours agonizing over every product and every review, and I couldn&#x27;t decide which one to try.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

            <li>I got the same results as i did from a cheap 25 dollar epilator.</li>
            <li>It works really well if you fall the instructions.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The light is genius, never thought I would need such thing</li>
            <li>That stuff REALLY works and you will see slower hair regrowth when used after epilation.&lt;br</li>
            <li>everything was smooth at the same time.</li>
            <li>how fast it works.</li>
            <li>haha).  </li>
            <li>I was very hesitant to buy, but read reviews and thought,</li>
            <li>It feels very plastic</li>
            <li>so much - ouch.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall though, I really like this product and would recommend it.</li>
            <li>But also hurts as the rotation movement is more rough.</li>
            <li>but let&#x27;s get real.</li>
            <li>However, since you are running the show, I found that pacing it according to your comfort levels is really helpful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But I don&#x27;t care much about it.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m very used to the sensation of the hairs being pulled out.  </li>
            <li>But like I mention before it&#x27;s so much faster removing all the hairs</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really looking forward to years of use from it.  </li>
            <li>but for what it&#x27;s designed to do, it does it very well.  </li>
            <li>Very nice-followed others advice on how to use it</li>
            <li>and it worked very well.</li>
            <li>or I&#x27;ve been a very unlucky customer.</li>
            <li>This Philips epilator does a very thorough job.  </li>
            <li>My legs actually felt smooth, which they never did when using the Panasonic one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was really looking forward to this working, but it doesn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li>and it left a perfectly smooth patch on his arm</li>
            <li>Granted, I am 5&#x27;1\\&quot; but I don&#x27;t think that made much of a difference.</li>
            <li>It works very well to remove the hair without pain.</li>
            <li>the actual product, the epilator is nice middle ground weight.</li>
            <li>I thought that it would be great for someone who would use the epilator in the dark (for some strange reason...)</li>
            <li>This personal female groomer is a must have for those who like to keep things nice and neat.</li>
            <li>Wow, big difference - didn&#x27;t hurt any more, and it just breezed through.</li>
            <li>Touch ups are necessary, but not as traumatic as a full epilation the first time.  </li>
            <li>To be honest, after about 5 minutes it really is no big deal.&lt;br /&gt;The contraption comes with different heads, a brush, an instruction manual,  and  an electric shaver head.</li>
            <li>because wow, in some of the more sensitive areas, it&#x27;s far from it</li>
            <li>Since this pulls the hair out completely, my skin is left looking smooth (no razor burn!)</li>
            <li>Ok, I bought this epilator because my old one needs to be replaced and of course this one ha so many features; well, it&#x27;s not truth; first of all battery is enough for less then 5-10 minutes and when it&#x27;s charging it does not work.</li>
            <li>/&gt;People discuss how its better than the Emjoy Emagine, a product definitely geared toward facial use and no one mentioned that the instructions in this thing says right off, &amp;#34;FOR USE BELOW THE NECK.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I called Philips to ask if they had lost their minds because even the BOX says, &amp;#34;Total Body and FACE&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>This is one of the best purchases I have made this past year!!!!</li>
            <li>I have to say that the first touch is more or less hurtful but after couple of seconds, I get used to it.  </li>
            <li>I began to look for new ways on internet, and thanks to God!</li>
            <li>At first I thought this was ridiculous, but really wow it&#x27;s nice!  </li>
            <li>The ceramic tweezer head really does grip the hairs better than the metal counterparts found on other epilators.</li>
            <li>I normally use a reusable manual razor and have to shave every 2 days!</li>
            <li>cordless aspect is my other favorite thing about this epilator.  </li>
            <li>I use it other every week to make sure all the hair out .</li>
            <li>The shaving on the other model is much better and smoother</li>
            <li>/&gt;First epilation hurt (similar to waxing just significantly a slower pain)&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Ceramic aspect is functions better than other types.  </li>
            <li>I love it and recommend it to other friends.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It gives me freedom from having to set my routine as per parlor timings and be ready for any sudden special occasions as well.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>I usually use it the day before, and by the next morning things look great.</li>
            <li>The same is true of the epilator really...</li>
            <li>The same is true of the epilator really...</li>
            <li>It was okay, nothing more or less than expected.</li>
            <li>Overall it&#x27;s worth a try but don&#x27;t expect 100% results after the first use.</li>
            <li>That was really the main purpose of this purchase for me.</li>
            <li>But, of the ones I have tried this one does the absolute best job of getting hairs the first pass through, pulling them out completely - not breaking them and doing it with the least pain possible.  </li>
            <li>As long as the body doesn&#x27;t get wet on this one, it&#x27;s good</li>
            <li>However, the hairs it leaves are very fine and very short and not noticeable to the eye, but only to touch.  </li>
            <li>This surprised me very much because I do not have course hair.</li>
            <li>If you want a little more, like a Brazilian wax, like me, you&#x27;ll need a little bit more time and some training at first, but is very doable.</li>
            <li>but thank god amazon still took it back and send me a new one, free of charge.</li>
            <li>I had one that was a good 10 years old and was surprised that the new one worked much easier and much less pain.</li>
            <li>had my eye on The Sharp Image epilator, it is still new and has only a couple of reviews (good ratings)</li>
            <li>This is my favorite attachment out of the whole set because the pain from epilating is slightly diminished.</li>
            <li>speed - super fast - for areas with lots of hair such as legs&lt;br</li>
            <li>you&#x27;d  think it would last awhile,works good but just breaks on you so fast and for no good reason,am super pissed,wasted  200 bucks,</li>
            <li>It was by pure luck that I got it for the price I did because I had this one in my shopping cart, but I still want to review it because I have found my new</li>
            <li>I expected the pain that hit initially from the rapid plucking, but was extremely pleased with the results!</li>
            <li>It is comfy in your hands (even for a long period of time) and the light on the epilator is INVALUABLE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;</li>
            <li>I did not believe this, because with shaving it seems the opposite is true.  </li>
            <li>This was my first time purchasing an epilator, and I wasn&#x27;t completely settled on buying this one.</li>
            <li>I have been using my old cheap epilator for years now and was excited to find out how a more expensive one would compare.</li>
            <li>This will be short and sweet.  </li>
            <li>I put a washcloth in my mouth to bite down on just in case though :)</li>
            <li>Use for my face and it works better than any other hair removal I have tried!</li>
            <li>Generally speaking, the shaving attachment is convenient for someone who prefers shaving a certain area over epilating, and the trimming attachment is great to trim down any long hairs.</li>
            <li>I have had it for a bit now, and was kind of thinking maybe it is not working as well as when I first got it, but I actually think it is because the hair is coming back thinner when it does come back.  </li>
            <li>happy, depilating time takes twice less than other one, Im</li>
            <li>Sharon was really helpful and offered to send me a new epilator head at no charge.  </li>
            <li>My wife really likes her new epilator.</li>
            <li>but she really noticed a difference with this New Philips Epilator.</li>
            <li>I can say, my previous epilator with metal plates did its job much better.</li>
            <li>The head is wider so it grabs more hairs and gets the job done faster than any of three previous epilators I have owned.</li>
            <li>it cannot even compare to the HP 2844 versiion, which is more easier to use and cost me less time.</li>
            <li>about pain: I&#x27;ve waxed many times and this hurts about as much/a bit less but just takes longer.  </li>
            <li>It comes with a shaver/trimmer attachment head, but that is just a plus, not the main thing (do not get this gadget just for shaving -</li>
            <li>my legs were super red</li>
            <li>I have had enough time to feel it out and get a better sense of how everything works, and here is my final review.&lt;br</li>
            <li>There are two main heads - the epilator and a shaver.  </li>
            <li>Short of one that could be used in the shower like my boyfriend&#x27;s the shaver portion is pretty much exactly what I was thinking of looking for at some point.  </li>
            <li>Short of one that could be used in the shower like my boyfriend&#x27;s the shaver portion is pretty much exactly what I was thinking of looking for at some point.  </li>
            <li>It charges quickly and the charge lasts through several epilation cycles.  </li>
            <li>Iv used many Epilators before and this was was goid while it last d bit actually took off the finnest hairs.</li>
            <li>Wife loves it, replaced an older model she had had for years.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Satinelle for the last 20 years and the basic model that cost $29 works 10x better than this one.</li>
            <li>I spent a good hour or so finishing up some of the rough patches.</li>
            <li>Because it also has a shaver head, it can not only be used as such, but can also shave hair to a length which the epilator can most reliably remove.  </li>
            <li>Luckily, they do not detract from the overall usefulness of the epilator.</li>
            <li>I use this mainly on my underarms, just after the shower and before applying deodorant.</li>
            <li>My hair tends to grow back quickly.  </li>
            <li>The TWEEZERS are also great not only because of the LED light but also because of the little lipstick tube it comes in that also has a little mirror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you hold it at the right angle (not hard, very comfortable) and move slowly it works fantastically.  </li>
            <li>Be sure to follow them and when they say to hold the skin tight</li>
            <li>Be sure to follow them and when they say to hold the skin tight</li>
            <li>Although I feel that it takes approximately the same length of time to shave using a traditional razor as it does electrically, I would still recommend the Philips satin perfect epilator as a whole.</li>
            <li>I think it doesn&#x27;t have a high quality.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>The price is a bit high, but you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think of myself as having an unusually high pain tolerance, and I didn&#x27;t have any issue at all with using the epilator on my legs.  </li>
            <li>My sister-in-law has been using one since she was 16 and highly recommended it.</li>
            <li>HIGHLY RECOMMEND</li>
            <li>It hurts a lot so you should have a high tolerance for pain.  </li>
            <li>I have another one (a Panasonic) that I have used for a few years, but it took several passes over the same patch of skin to pull out most of the hair, and never would pull out all the hairs no matter how many times I went over the skin.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this Philips product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>The epilator also has a built-in light that it really helps finding hairs you were not aware of.</li>
            <li>I really love this little machine.  </li>
            <li>Oh this little baby makes my life so much better.</li>
            <li>Wow!!</li>
            <li>Again, I love this little machine.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better than I&#x27;ve expected!!!</li>
            <li>The skin stays smoother for longer too, with less ingrowns (use gentle loofah every day andyou&#x27;ll be fine - my waxing lady told me to do it</li>
            <li>Great Epilator, but not for the faint at heart (imagine that goes for any Epilator).  </li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t painful at all and did a marvelous job of removing hair.  </li>
            <li>I found it to be easier than expected and my legs felt smooth.  </li>
            <li>It is much quieter than my old model</li>
            <li>I really like my replicator so far.</li>
            <li>If you have a long enough eyebrow hair, sure, any tweezers will do.</li>
            <li>that normal hair removal is known for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It also works pretty good as a shaver, so if you are unable to tolerate the epilator feature you can still use it as an electric shaver.</li>
            <li>My leg hairs were only able 1-1.5mm long.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t use it for more than a few seconds at a time.  </li>
            <li>The key to success...</li>
            <li>Bought it a few years ago, and I still love it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m now glad I misplaced it and had to buy another epilator.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found that I can really only use it for my legs, but it&#x27;s still worth it to me.</li>
            <li>While $100 may be overpriced I personally find that it was definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li>I expect I&#x27;ll have to do touch-up every few days for a while, but even that is much better than slicing myself up shaving (</li>
            <li>I usually use the Braun epilator but have found that to get the best results I need to shave at least once in between epilations.  </li>
            <li>Although, I might look like a fool by putting this in my review but at least now it is an honest review.</li>
            <li>others have said, if you&#x27;re a first time user, have a professional waxing done first, of the areas you will use the epilator, then use this as soon as you start to see hairs grow back - maybe every week or two.  </li>
            <li>and so I only had a days worth of hair growth</li>
            <li>This shaver seems to catch more hair than my Emjoi, although I  have to shave several times in different directions as I did with my old shaver.  </li>
            <li>The shaver/ epilator work well for the most part, but does have a few flaws.  </li>
            <li>I do have to go in different directions for it to pull all of the hairs out, but it is still worth it.  </li>
            <li>I had high expectation for this new version, well it ends up with quite disappoitment.</li>
            <li>I have some very fine and light hair that can be difficult to see so</li>
            <li>after I did a little research, I was pretty excited to try it out.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s true that you have to be super careful of ingrown hairs I use a pumice stone, and tweezers to pull out and potential problems, but still have issues here or there.</li>
            <li>Love the ease of using it, except it doesn&#x27;t last very long, broke within 8 months.</li>
            <li>It can be used plugged in or not so you never have to stop half way and charge, the light really helps also.</li>
            <li>The light on the epilator made it easy to see any hairs I&#x27;d missed even in my poorly lit bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I normally buy the Braun ones but didn&#x27;t like that any of the new ones that you can use in the shower.</li>
            <li>It was already charged enough to work right out of the box</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t have any trouble figuring out the right amount of pressure (not very much, just enough to keep full contact with skin), and loved that I can do this dry.  </li>
            <li>This was priced great for all the functions it has, but it is a lot more painful than my Epilady, but besides that it gets the job done!</li>
            <li>Keep in mind this is a LONG process, it&#x27;s not like the quick zip of a razor.&lt;br /&gt;Day</li>
            <li>I feel like it just reflects off my skin, making it not so easy to see my dark</li>
            <li>I guess my hair isn&#x27;t long enough to grab there so not so effective, but there is a definite difference as compared to right armpit which I left alone to compare.  </li>
            <li>Nothing, but nothing, beats a sharp manual razor for a close, smooth shave, esp on a one-day growth of whiskers.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The added feature of a light on the shaver was extremely helpful because you could see what you missed.  </li>
            <li>a lot of research before this purchase as it was one of the more expensive, Im very pleased results, were just as expected.</li>
            <li>The light is extremely helpful, in fact, I would never buy an epilator without one.</li>
            <li>The deluxe version comes with the active hair lifter, active massaging system with pivoting cap, shaving head, trimming comb, and illuminating smart tweezers.</li>
            <li>I consider my pain tolerance to be pretty high, I&#x27;ve had multiple tatoos and did child birth without an epidural.</li>
            <li>Performance Cap - To be used if you are new to epilation.</li>
            <li>This alone makes me want to continue to use the epilator as my new means to shaving.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re new to epilation, I suggest trying them.  </li>
            <li>so I started looking for a new one.</li>
            <li>i live out of usa</li>
            <li>live</li>
            <li>I was reluctant to try this new way of shaving my legs.  </li>
            <li>Decided get  new one.</li>
            <li>one has all the bells and whistles you need if you&#x27;re new to epilating.</li>
            <li>Let me give you a helpful review for all new users like me who want to try it.&lt;br /&gt;1.</li>
            <li>So he ordered me a new product on May 29th.</li>
            <li>I checked online, but could not find anywhere to order the replacement part, so I started a chat with their customer service via the Philips.com website with the intent of ordering, and paying for, a new head.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had an Emjoi for years, but thought I would try something new.  </li>
            <li>Proper exfoliation and post treatment (I occasionally use PFB vanish) make a huge difference and help prevent ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li>I first used the epilator as it came, with just the normal head and such with no attachments.</li>
            <li>- This will only fit onto the above attachment (Shave, /trim and Style Attachment) and is used to trim your hair before epilation at a recommended length of about 1/8\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>It feels expensive...and very female oriented frankly with all the smooth lines, white and flowers.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I do really like the epilator, a day after its use, I&#x27;m ready to recommend with 5 stars, however, after about 10 days, I&#x27;m at a three star because its grown back in.  </li>
            <li>My first time it took several days for the skin to return to normal -</li>
            <li>Is very modern with different funcions</li>
            <li>I also have very sensitive skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Even after first use I can definitely see slower regrowth.  </li>
            <li>This is the first and only Epilator I have purchased and I have owned it for over a year.</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>I was not expecting it to be as loud as it was!</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s loud!</li>
            <li>So for the armpit I still use my old one!</li>
            <li>This is first epilator I have purchased and it will be the last as well.</li>
            <li>I will update this review as I continue to use this product but after the first use on various body parts:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not sure I&#x27;ll ever be able to use it on my legs though...</li>
            <li>Oh, it is loud!.  </li>
            <li>Use after a hot shower to open the pores and minimize irritation.  </li>
            <li>Yep, especially the first use.</li>
            <li>If you have ever tweezed your eyebrows, IT IS THE EXACT SAME FEELING!</li>
            <li>Wow!  </li>
            <li>Therefore I have to use it more often then usual.</li>
            <li>My favorite so far are the extra wide and</li>
            <li>The Philips is about twice the price I paid for my first epilator, but I feel its twice the quality, so I didnt mind paying the extra.</li>
            <li>hair that grows in different directs pretty well</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using epilators for the past 15 years and this is one of the better ones I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
            <li>So many are going to grab this for Christmas only to open the directions and have such a bummer of a let</li>
            <li>Only suggestion I might make is for the lighted tweezers to be a bit higher quality.</li>
            <li>The ceramic heads on the Philips are very simple looking and not scary at all.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this epilator for about 6 months now, and if it broke tomorrow I would not hesitate to buy the exact same one again.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;I will not give this product review a higher score until I can actually use this product for longer than 1 month,</li>
            <li>Wow, what a difference!</li>
            <li>Wow, what a difference!  </li>
            <li>The first pass got almost all the hair, and the second got the rest.  </li>
            <li>Everything&#x27;s ok but the &amp;#34;Shave,trim and style&amp;#34; attachement is missing!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The light is bright, the battery lasts for longer than expected at full power, and the shape of the handle is comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;AS with all epilators, it&#x27;s not completely painless, but it is less painful than many I have previously used, even on more sensitive areas.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Quick and very efficient with a lot less &#x27;missed spots&#x27; and &#x27;pain&#x27;.</li>
            <li>it is actually faster and gentler than my previous epilator, no need to be nearby a plug as it is rechargeable, and the LIGHT makes things so much easier!  </li>
            <li>True, there is still a little sting (emphasis on little) but the results last a week or more!</li>
            <li>I would like to stop shaving due to dark underarms from razor burns in the past and this is the perfect product to help with that.</li>
            <li>Even then, I fully expected to return it fairly quickly.</li>
            <li>and I tried using it for upper lips and got full red patches and burnt sensation for 2days.</li>
            <li>I applied some No Scream Cream 45 minutes before doing my legs for the first time, though, and it hurt much less--after a while I was watching my TV show with only the occasional wince as I stripped my legs of hair.</li>
            <li>/&gt;You will have slight stubble, but it won&#x27;t be very noticeable, as you&#x27;re not cutting the hair like shaving, but rather producing &amp;</li>
            <li>The epilator does not remove EVERY SINGLE HAIR, so if your objective is baby butt smooth legs, this product may not be for you.  </li>
            <li>When first turning on the epilator and going straight to the second speed setting, or switching over to the lower speed setting while the epilator is on, it is sometimes difficult to know whether you have successfully selected the setting (the sound difference between the two speeds is very minimal so this may be hard to determine success.)</li>
            <li>Well, first, you need to choose a less sensitive area for your first epilating experiences.  </li>
            <li>There are at least four different &amp;#34;heads&amp;#34; and I choose the one that massages skin when epilating, love it!</li>
            <li>But I turned it on and the light helps you see all of the little hairs you wouldn&#x27;t before.</li>
            <li>Even if I never use the tweezers on the go, atleast I&#x27;ll have the little light in case of emergency.</li>
            <li>I like the little light.</li>
            <li>I love the epilator mechanism (it is less painful than my last one), as well as the light the bonus heads are really nice as well.</li>
            <li>While it is a little loud, the sound isn&#x27;t unbearable.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>Inside the box was a cute little white zippered bag to keep all of the attachments that come with the epilator in one place!</li>
            <li>The light on the epilator is a life saver especially on my blonde hairs that can be much harder to see.&lt;br</li>
            <li>that years of evolution creates a product that is clearly a regression!&lt;br</li>
            <li>Mine was at least 10-15 years old, so I suspected (hoped) that a newer model would work better.  </li>
            <li>The issue was completely my fault, so I really appreciated them going the extra mile.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a guy, and not very hairy, but definitely prefer smooth.  </li>
            <li>Because the roots of my hair are pretty dark, shaving doesn&#x27;t really do the job for me</li>
            <li>So far, I like it,</li>
            <li>The see-through \\&quot;glass\\&quot; (it is actually plastic) effect on the front is also very attracting.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t feel like they really do anything extra.</li>
            <li>I use Lush&#x27;s Aqua Mirabilis Body Butter bar.</li>
            <li>I just don&#x27;t feel like the razor really gets close enough to do anything.</li>
            <li>I had an old one that just wasn&#x27;t working too well.  </li>
            <li>The pain is no big deal, goes by fast</li>
            <li>Some people had me so terrified with horror stories of the epilator that I regretted getting it at first, until I tried it for myself and saw the results that allowed me to go a long time without having to worry about my leg hair and having softer, finer, and blonder leg hair that grew in.</li>
            <li>Fast forward to a week later....    </li>
            <li>As far as the bikini area...</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin on my legs</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t even dissolve one hair, and it irritated my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I expected a bit better performance from it - when it goes out, I think I will get Braun again (switched after my old one stopped working to see which performs better), when this one fails.</li>
            <li>thought it was going to be like the old Epilady torture device of the 90&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>Let me say - WOW was I wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>You can go to a professional, which I recommend if you&#x27;ve never had waxing experience, or you can do it yourself with the home kits.  </li>
            <li>When epilating (with any epilator) there is always the chance that a hair, instead of being pulled out completely, will break off at the surface of the skin or just underneath.  </li>
            <li>When the battery dies, it doesn&#x27;t do it gradually like my old one, it&#x27;ll just stop</li>
            <li>mine was getting really old</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t so much &#x27;pull hair&#x27; as it does &#x27;grab it and break it off just above the surface.&#x27;</li>
            <li>Unless I am in direct sunlight I could never get all my hair because I couldn&#x27;t see them&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so it takes some time to remove them completely</li>
            <li>I purshased this epilator as a replacement for my old one.</li>
            <li>It is comfortable to the grip and also not too heavy</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been 3 weeks though and my hair is already starting to come in so much thinner.</li>
            <li>This flimsy thing was like an old Timex...</li>
            <li>As a matter of fact I just bought another one because my 20year old burned.</li>
            <li>/&gt;As far as swelling, yes there will be some.</li>
            <li>It works fast and surprisingly quiet.</li>
            <li>and complete instructions&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li>It is also loud.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an got an extension for sensitive spots like under arms and bikini lines.</li>
            <li>it is loud.  </li>
            <li>I have two kids and a busy life (who doesn&#x27;t?)</li>
            <li>The epilator feature is what I have used so far.</li>
            <li>bought this as my old epilady was falling apart-  </li>
            <li>is nearly always).</li>
            <li>I started using an epilator since I was 10 years old.</li>
            <li>reason I have rated this product so low is it doesn&#x27;t really work.</li>
            <li>I am now using my old one still</li>
            <li>The rotating heads are not so soft as the old model.</li>
            <li>The old model is/was really soft and gentle.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li>old undies</li>
            <li>The device stopped immediately, but the head was completely tangled with elastic.  </li>
            <li>Needs frequent charging.</li>
            <li>I did feel it the first time because my hairs were really long.</li>
            <li>My old epilator had metal disks, this one has ceramic.  </li>
            <li>so maybe my skin is just sensitive in those areas.</li>
            <li>The Philips also has a closer shave than the old one.  </li>
            <li>noice is just as loud as my old epilator.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I used to get rush and bumps from my old Remington.</li>
            <li>Really dissapointed, it is going back.</li>
            <li>(I had an old Emjoi Soft Caress Epilator - 36 Gold Plated).</li>
            <li>and then I just rinsed all the parts off in the sink when I was completely done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My old epilator seemed to have lost its umph.  </li>
            <li>Well, I decided to go with this product again because I wanted to see if a more expensive one was really worth it.  </li>
            <li>If you stick through the first couple of painful sessions, then you will be rewarded with gorgeous smooth long lasting hairless legs!  </li>
            <li>my wife is Brazilian and she had one this maybe not the same but one that works just like this one, so any way she is in love with it, it does what is meat to do, without too much trouble, no need to read a manual, you can use while is charging.</li>
            <li>It is really good but not perfect.</li>
            <li>I love this product and I have thick corse hair</li>
            <li>Then I wait till I&#x27;m about ready to go to bed, and then I usually run a quick bath just to exfoliate.</li>
            <li>Twice, while epilating, my hand has slipped and my finger has jammed right into the spinning heads.</li>
            <li>For people that can use the tweezers however, the light pinpoints a specific area extremely well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve previously owned two emjois, the last one, the emagine, had a piece of that round plastic on the outside edge of the tweezers crack and snap off, just outside the 30-day warranty (cost $140) and emjoi &amp;#34;customer service&amp;#34; couldn&#x27;t repair or replace--they recommended I buy the next best model.</li>
            <li>Simply press the on/off button once to turn on the device (this is the high speed); press again (this is the slow speed); press one more time and it turns the device off.    </li>
            <li>The light really helps to see the small hairs, and I only needed a couple of passes to get all the hairs.  </li>
            <li>After letting the epilator charge for a little while (it charges pretty fast), I decided to give it a go on my leg.</li>
            <li>What would be useful would be to know how to compares to other epilator options.  </li>
            <li>What would be useful would be to know how to compares to other epilator options.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been epilating for a while, so I went right for the direct hit without using any of the other accessories and again, would call it almost painless.  </li>
            <li>so I could only shave maybe once or twice a week, and my hair grows back very fast.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love the active hair lifter attachment, especially on my legs - as the hairs tend to lay flat.</li>
            <li>I had a Epilady prior to this one and thought I would try a new brand!</li>
            <li>Having only used this one, all I can say is this one is super nice in every way except that it hurts like crazy.</li>
            <li>My mom had an Epilady, which was less like an actual hair remover, and more like a medieval torture device.  </li>
            <li>Shave first and then start epilating on a daily basis two days later.</li>
            <li>I had an older version of satin epilator, but after several years it stop working.</li>
            <li>But this one only seems to work if hairs are a particular texture/length, and either ignores or breaks the others.</li>
            <li>effect (for a few weeks at least) :o)</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;You have to wait awhile for the hairs to grow long enough (not as fun in summer</li>
            <li>I have appreciated the reviewers who have separated their experiences with epilating in general from their experiences of using a specific expilator.</li>
            <li>job (the most important!) - 1 star :(</li>
            <li>I have been epilating for years and recently purchased this to replace an older emjoi model.  </li>
            <li>on how to attach certain attachments were not clear.</li>
            <li>This scared me a little more seeing how fast those little tweezers were moving.</li>
            <li>I use the high speed setting, and it doesn&#x27;t appear to be quite as wakening so to say as the low speed.  </li>
            <li>I managed to do all of this in less than 30 minutes on one charge and the low battery light</li>
            <li>I used the epilator on my legs and it really doesn&#x27;t work unless your hairs are a somewhat long.</li>
            <li>It WORKS!!!, small hair, not a problem, picks up everything, leaves skin smooth for over 2 weeks.</li>
            <li>My only complaint is that is seems to &amp;#34;break&amp;#34; a lot of hairs instead removing it completely, so I have to use it more often than I would like to for touch-ups throughout the week.</li>
            <li>The battery lasts long and doesn&#x27;t take much time to charge.</li>
            <li>Last but not least, there is the shaving/trimming attachment.</li>
            <li>think if you&#x27;re used to waxing and have success with that, and your hair doesn&#x27;t grow in a crazy mess, you&#x27;ll enjoy the easy and cost effectiveness of this product.</li>
            <li>Also the epilator only catches hairs of a certain length, so if you use just an epilator you will constantly have stubble.</li>
            <li>The epilator can only grab a hair of a certain length, leaving those that are too short.</li>
            <li>too large for facial, particularly upper lip, use.</li>
            <li>After first use your legs will look like little raised blotches of skin (where the hair was pulled out), but if you epilate at night before bed and immediately after epilating used a cool washrag to rub down your legs and then moisturize the swelling will be completely gone by morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This epilator will leave behind the very fine and shorter hairs, you know they are there to the touch, but not at all visible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am in total shock that my legs are still smooth (besides the little hairs the epilator missed and the hairs</li>
            <li>The accessories are fragile and the little bag that came with is really cheap.</li>
            <li>Only because I wanted a brand spanking new one did I buy this epilator.</li>
            <li>It is definitely noisier than my old Braun one, but the pro&#x27;s far outweigh that one con.</li>
            <li>The end results are essentially the same, except the razor will give much smoother results</li>
            <li>The only real inconvenience I guess is the fact that it cant be used in the shower and the head comes off a bit occasionally</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much cheaper than regular waxing and provides a similar result.</li>
            <li>It truly helps me see &amp; quickly pick up on the few stray hairs that get</li>
            <li>I go quite slowly, about 30 minutes for both legs (could easily do in 20)</li>
            <li>I thought the light would be annoying, but it&#x27;s actually really nice because it helps you see any hairs you might have missed.</li>
            <li>However after first epilation (the most painful time) I really like using Philips Hp6576.</li>
            <li>Now I have dark hair, so I can see a lot without the light, but I can only imagine if I had blonde hair, this would be a Godsend.  </li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this product to anyone who would be willing to put in the extra 5 minutes to epilate and in return receive longer lasting hairless legs.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this product to anyone who would be willing to put in the extra 5 minutes to epilate and in return receive longer lasting hairless legs.</li>
            <li>not other seller.&lt;br /&gt;im</li>
            <li>I actually think this one works best at cutting down the pain.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>The fine little hairs don&#x27;t get caught and have to be quite long.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t find the extra attachments useful, however compared to other epilator products and prices,</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, that aside, I do like the product overall and even if the epilator function isn&#x27;t a first choice over the old Shick Pro Glide, a lot of the other features are nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>A little pricey but worth</li>
            <li>It does not look like it looks in the photos, it is less shiny and less elegant (but it&#x27;s not a fashion</li>
            <li>I wish I had been more serious about hair removal earlier in life.  </li>
            <li>I still managed to use it with gritted teeth very slowly, but it wasn&#x27;t enjoyable -</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d have it permanently removed, but apparently that&#x27;s hard for light hair.</li>
            <li>This works great to remove hair, but is PAINFUL.  </li>
            <li>I might keep it in my purse for general use</li>
            <li>/&gt;And now for my story on epilating in general . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t shave.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if that is a product-specific problem, or a general epilator problem.</li>
            <li>Overall, each attachment offers an improved epilating experience.</li>
            <li>Not to mention it barely fits all of the items.</li>
            <li>Trim and Style Attachment - This is used to shave sensitive areas such as your underarms and bikini area and legs.  </li>
            <li>I have yet to manage to completely sit through an entire leg session, but we&#x27;ll see...</li>
            <li>I have yet to manage to completely sit through an entire leg session, but we&#x27;ll see...</li>
            <li>I used it for shaving my upper legs and armpits--even though I&#x27;ve epilated for years, those areas are too sensitive for me to epilate.  </li>
            <li>but if you are sensitive to pain or just starting out try using covered ice packs or frozen wash cloths until you get used to things.  </li>
            <li>Once you get past the first (really ouch) time (wine helps a lot), if you use it regularly (I&#x27;m of the... um... hirsute variety</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe this listing says specifically, &amp;#34;&amp;#34;Ergonomic design for both sensitive face and body areas&amp;#34; and the item&#x27;s instructions say quite the opposite and its no typo.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The rest in the bow is complete, i wonder how can this be possible!?</li>
            <li>may be hairier than the normal gal (Eastern European genes) but it only lasts about 2 weeks (not 4 weeks)&lt;br /&gt;Epilating the arm pits hurt like and hasn&#x27;t gotten better&lt;</li>
            <li>Is the pain worth not shaving for a few weeks?</li>
            <li>but she found that the epilator function doesn&#x27;t give her a good shave on her legs (at least for the small part that she could stand to use it on).</li>
            <li>But honestly, even when the hair does grow back, it grows back thin.</li>
            <li>Too many unnecessary accessories</li>
            <li>&quot;, I didn&#x27;t find it useful, as the head is horizontally wide so it did not feel as if it covered more area, also it made it difficult to epilate in curves areas (underarms, ankle area, and bikini line).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>/&gt;First to test, I did the little tiny hairs on my knuckles, zero pain, quickly gone.  </li>
            <li>I have very fine thin blonde hair, and it seems to struggle to catch them all.</li>
            <li>The first time I sat down to use it I was so nervous.</li>
            <li>The first time I sat down to use it I was so nervous.</li>
            <li>She found that it worked better on her feet where there is less hair (and the hair is less coarse).</li>
            <li>Although with a larger head, it fails to remove a lot of hairs and when that happens it hurts more!</li>
            <li>If I were new to epilators, I&#x27;d have thrown the whole mess in a box and sent it back.  </li>
            <li>My hair type is soft, and fine, yet annoys me (since I have visible amounts that I&#x27;m not happy with as a female).&lt;br</li>
            <li>After 10 minutes of use the shaver did not loose any power.  </li>
            <li>Shaved my legs one time every other week to show my legs one day because of the fast grow of my hair.</li>
            <li>but I think all the little extras make it worth the extra money</li>
            <li>Way better than having to shave everyday to every other day!!</li>
            <li>Waited until May 29th (2 weeks) to call back (since I still had not received my charger) to tell them my story again and this person said that the previous person did not help me enough, and that I should have been ordered a whole new product, under warranty.</li>
            <li>For something that seems like it should be so simple, the instruction sheet is huge and confusing.  </li>
            <li>For something that seems like it should be so simple, the instruction sheet is huge and confusing.  </li>
            <li>MUCH easier than shaving, can do it on the couch while bored watching tv, and it leaves your skin smooth.</li>
            <li>The active massaging system with pivoting cap attachment also works really well.</li>
            <li>After the second or third time epilating, my legs were completely stubble-free.</li>
            <li>Loud enough to bother my french bulldogs who must have thought I was being attacked because they both came to my rescue.&lt;br</li>
            <li>; it really was minimal, especially considering what you&#x27;re doing (removing hair at the roots).  </li>
            <li>don&#x27;t really work to well and can actually make it a bit harder to get to some areas.  </li>
            <li>I did one last shave, and right about when I started seeing little stubby hairs again</li>
            <li>An hour and a half later my legs are a little sensitive and tingly but my arms and hands feel fine</li>
            <li>It is a little intimidating at first to hear the shaver on and see the shaver wheel grind.  </li>
            <li>Yes, it hurts little bit at first.</li>
            <li>I managed to do my full legs in about an hour from big toe to 1&amp;#34; away from my bikini line with only a few winces on my inner thighs, I think.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it hurts much less if you use it on the second or third day of your period, or right after it.</li>
            <li>- come back here to find a product that&#x27;s right for you; the pain becomes bearable after the hairs have been pulled out of their follicles a few times.  </li>
            <li>So I will begin with the review of this specific product, and if you want to know my experience with epilating in general, you can keep reading.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I did get red spots on my legs where the hair was pulled, but the spots were completely gone by the next day and they only seem to appear now when the hair is longer or denser (i.e. going longer between epliating sessions).  </li>
            <li>So far it seems to hold a charge for a long time, about 45 minutes.  </li>
            <li>My take on this is: first time use will hurt, but try to use it after you have had wax/shaved and have few hairs showed up.</li>
            <li>While it is not exactly comfortable at first by the time i finished one leg</li>
            <li>My hairs are thick and darks even before my first shave there were really dark, that all the students in the school make fun of me.</li>
            <li>Also, the skin under my arms doesn&#x27;t seem to get totally dry no matter how much I dry it, so maybe that&#x27;s why it isn&#x27;t picking up as much, too.  </li>
            <li>The epilator may not have as much life as one that has a \\&quot;switch\\&quot; type of button (where you go up or down depending on the preferred speed.)</li>
            <li>It took about 10 minutes to do both legs from the knee down, so I would guess that 20 minutes for both whole legs is about right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If, like me, you sometimes get super lazy in the winter and ignore your legs for months, there is always the option of starting over with the initial waxing</li>
            <li>In addition it is very sharp and fast.</li>
            <li>Much faster than the previous model I owned.</li>
            <li>But so far they are doing the job well, and only time will tell how long the plastic tweezers will hold up.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The cute packaging of this $150 razor appealed to my 15-yr-old daughter, who had no better luck than I did with the epilator (ouch, and no smooth shave; pain but no gain).</li>
            <li>I will say that it DOES GET EASIER after the first few times over the same area.</li>
            <li>For someone that may have sensitive skin to begin with and needs the lower setting every single time, this would be a hassle.</li>
            <li>The charge on the Braun does not last long enough to complete the job and it cannot be used while charging.</li>
            <li>Also the cordless feature only lasts around 40 mins, which isn&#x27;t really long enough to complete both legs.</li>
            <li>my hair grows back very slowly and fine.  </li>
            <li>It has not dulled down a bit, which is a relief after discovering how quickly the shaving attachment dulled down.</li>
            <li>It has not dulled down a bit, which is a relief after discovering how quickly the shaving attachment dulled down.</li>
            <li>I was very intrigued by epilators about a year back and was so intrigued that I purchased a Braun one with little metal disks rather than the ceramic ones like this product contains.</li>
            <li>I will list all the points good &amp; bad</li>

    <h2>Negative Reviews</h2>
    <ol>
            <li> Pouch excellent for containing all parts.  </li>
            <li> I found it best to work through in stages</li>
            <li> That way you aren&#x27;t attacking all your hairs at once since regrowth isn&#x27;t perfectly uniform even with shaving.</li>
            <li> this has been one of the best products and return on the money one can expect.</li>
            <li> I use it on bikini area for a fairly flawless appearance.</li>

            <li> really happy with my purchase!</li>
            <li> I am impressed with this product for a couple reasons.</li>
            <li> I think this is one of the best purchases I have made.</li>
            <li> This is the best Epilator!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best epilator I&#x27;ve ever had!!!</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t the best one, and with the time and use wasn&#x27;t doing the job the way</li>
            <li> The tweezer itself isn&#x27;t the best either, It doesnt grasp any of the hairs...</li>
            <li> im happy!</li>
            <li> Best of all, for me, is that the ceramic head means that I can use this, despite having a metal allergy.  </li>
            <li> It is packaged and the product itself is very attractive and female-orientated, it doesn&#x27;t look like a mans razor.  </li>
            <li> very happy.</li>
            <li> I use the shaving extension and it&#x27;s great!!</li>

            <li> I am very impressed with this epilator.  </li>
            <li> but I did use the shaver/trimmer on them to make the hair shorter for when I do get the courage and it worked perfectly.</li>
            <li> Happy ith my purchase!</li>
            <li> I love this epilator!!!</li>
            <li> This product is amazing!!</li>

            <li> All in all a very good product.</li>
            <li> It is a very good product.</li>
            <li> Shaver is also very good.  </li>

            <li> The lights on my tweezers and Phillips satin perfect epilator are still brightly lit.</li>
            <li> The Philips Satin Perfect Epilator is a bit overpriced, but it can be a good investment to make.</li>
            <li> It works beautifully all over(Underarms, hands, legs) and the speed control allows you to choose your level of comfort with the pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so easy to use!!!</li>
            <li> I am so happy with this product ...</li>
            <li> The mirror that is included is a great tool to go along with the tweezers.</li>
            <li> It has great zoom - probably a2 or even 3x zoom.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for stuffing all of my equipment in there - my epilator, tweezers, attachments, and charger.</li>
            <li> works great...</li>
            <li> Although sometimes it hurts to use, once I desensitize, it works great.</li>
            <li> The shaving head works great.</li>
            <li> There are two speeds which is really great, I use change between the two a lot.</li>

            <li> Great product.</li>
            <li> The electric razor head does not get as close, but it is a great option if you are in a hurry.  </li>
            <li> Great product.  </li>
            <li> is a great machine, and I am greatful</li>
            <li> So what&#x27;s great about this epilator?  </li>
            <li> great transaction.</li>
            <li> this product (Philips HP6576 Satin Perfect Deluxe Epilator, White/Champagne)</li>
            <li> Ligth tweezer is great.</li>
            <li> So if you are lookin g for an epilator, this one is a great choice.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great how I can shave/trim too.</li>
            <li> It has lots of accessory heads for the epilator and the trim attachment for the razor works great.</li>
            <li> bought it for my wife and she loves it,, takes time to used to it but works great</li>
            <li> it is a great product.</li>
            <li> Great for underarms, legs and the bikini area.</li>
            <li> This product is great.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall I am extremely happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s great for what it&#x27;s supposed to do and</li>
            <li> But that&#x27;s what makes it great.</li>
            <li> A great plus is that it does not pinch my skin, the Braun used to do that (made me bleed at times) and</li>
            <li> The clipper attachment is great and</li>
            <li> This is a great product.</li>
            <li> Great idea</li>
            <li> The lighted tweezers are also a great addition to the things you get.  </li>
            <li> This is a great tool for that process.</li>
            <li> Great product.</li>
            <li> I thought this would be a great option.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Philips epilator which was working greatly</li>
            <li> I was happy with that brand.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The light is excellent in helping see in the darker areas and the directions are awesome.</li>
            <li> The light is excellent in helping see in the darker areas and the directions are awesome.</li>
            <li> Love this product!!</li>
            <li> My boyfriend has a Panasonic shaver (for men) with a very nice head...</li>
            <li> what I have done with it looks very nice.    </li>
            <li> VERY nice.</li>
            <li> I called the Philips 800 number and the rep was very nice and helpful.</li>
            <li> This is just amazing!</li>
            <li> I will recommend it to everyone since it does an amazing job!</li>
            <li> Over all, GREAT PRODUCT!!! :)</li>
            <li> All of which I have yet to try, but I&#x27;m sure are equally awesome.  </li>
            <li> But for a women like me who&#x27;s hair is always growing, and the hair is THICK...being able to just buzz it off is priceless to me.</li>
            <li> I do my own brazilian with it too!</li>
            <li> Just a good sturdy product and does a great job.</li>
            <li> I am still really enjoying this product and can also vouch for the excellent customer service provided by Philips when I had a problem with it.  </li>
            <li> ITEM OF EXCEPTIONALLY EXCELLENT QUALITY, GREAT ITEM, GOOD PRICE PRODUCT, DETAILED, WORKS</li>
            <li> It has a very attractive design, and is easy to hold and</li>
            <li> It is really bright.  </li>
            <li> the bright side.</li>
            <li> Its a good product....</li>
            <li> and I get good results.  </li>
            <li> item is as described and price is fair.</li>
            <li> good service and prompt delivery.</li>
            <li> Anyway you spin it, this just doesn&#x27;t feel good.</li>
            <li> Shaving that area never produces good results for me.</li>
            <li> But it seems to be doing a good job.  </li>
            <li> its a good Epilator</li>
            <li> Good product...</li>
            <li> it holds a good charge for about 40-50 mins.</li>
            <li> used but in good condition.</li>
            <li> 2 years ago it was good.</li>
            <li> it comes in is really nice as well great for traveling and fits everything with ease.</li>
            <li> It removes my hair really good and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.</li>
            <li> did not used all the tools, but the ones that I used I just loved.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good</li>
            <li> Really good epilator.</li>
            <li> Considering the good job it does.</li>
            <li> superior to the silk epil</li>
            <li> Works good..</li>
            <li> The feature I best like about the Philips&#x27; epilator is the light.  </li>
            <li> Should be good to go.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li> Also, the build-in light is priceless!</li>
            <li> Light is a necessity and works perfectly.  </li>
            <li> my mother in law loved it</li>
            <li> Good luck to deciding on whether or not to purchase this product</li>
            <li> A good package too</li>
            <li> The led light is awesome.</li>
            <li> I actually laughed out</li>
            <li> I actually laughed out</li>
            <li> I wanted to give a fair review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The results are not so good as waxing, but if you don&#x27;t like waxing or if you don&#x27;t want to go to a beauty salon, you can epilate at home with this at anytime.</li>
            <li> really good thing</li>
            <li> And shipping is also good.</li>
            <li> I chose this based on the reviews and while it is good, it is not as good as everyone said.</li>
            <li> It is a good epilator, just not as good as everyone claimed.</li>
            <li> Loved it.</li>
            <li> Good</li>
            <li> /&gt;Final Result - Good for hand and legs..</li>
            <li> but she says this is superior in every aspect.</li>
            <li> The message heads are good for beginners</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a true epilator this is not the best choice.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and does a very good job.</li>
            <li> The light is very bright and has good spread [distance.]</li>
            <li> However, the light - which is located in between the two clamps of the tweezers - is very bright.</li>
            <li> Very good quality and the light helps a lot.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this aspect of epilation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is totally worth the pain for the perfect bikini area for me.</li>
            <li> Seems very safe.  </li>
            <li> However, for an electric razor I&#x27;m very satisfied.  </li>

            <li> Before getting the Satin Perfect, I did a lot of research and this seemed like a pretty good one to go with.</li>
            <li> and she is very satisfied.</li>
            <li> Very nice, beautiful, useful.</li>
            <li> I love the light, and the speed settings and rollers are perfect.</li>

            <li> The shaver attachment works as well as the Epilator itself, and the light make all the difference when you are trying to work in those hard-to-see areas!!</li>
            <li> I love it!  </li>
            <li> I love the convenience!</li>
            <li> A review on the Philips HP6576/50 Satin Perfect Deluxe Epilator, and not a story about my first epilating experience:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use and does a great job.  </li>
            <li> Good and Quick!!</li>
            <li> They do a great job of grabbing at thicker hairs (armpits) but leave all the fine hairs on my legs behind.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> Very nice and easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This product is very effective and easy to use.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s shape is makes it easy to handle and its pattern its very nice.</li>
            <li> The light is a great idea, but for me, the tweezers didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> It smells amazing, provided me with soothing relief immediately, and targets ingrown hairs, razor bumps, razor burn, and redness.</li>
            <li> It uses ground almond shells to exfoliate and the combination of sandalwood and rose oils smells AMAZING.</li>
            <li> These are amazing.</li>
            <li> I have used my Philips Satin Perfect Deluxe Epilator a few times and have had perfect results.</li>
            <li> and it is just absolutely amazing.</li>
            <li> I probably wouldn&#x27;t have bought this without the amazing deal Philips offered on it.</li>
            <li> I also want to see what kind of irritation occurs the day after.  </li>
            <li> She loved the cute battery-lighted tweezers in its lipstick-sized tube.</li>
            <li> It looks nice and fits in with the cosmetic theme, but the button does not meet my Philip expectations.</li>
            <li> The honest truth is, this thing hurts.</li>
            <li> Having the slower speed in nice when you are going over knobby areas like the knees/elbows.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> A nice addition</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t often use them.ally handy.</li>
            <li> Having the slower speed in nice when you are going over knobby areas like the knees/elbows.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> A nice addition</li>
            <li> fancy tweezers that come with this package are a nice bonus, as is the massage head.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re just looking to try out the epilator head without any additional attachments, I would recommend skipping the deluxe version and getting [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> /&gt;The unit comes with a nice carrying case as well.  </li>
            <li> I liked results except for the pain part.</li>
            <li> I love that I can do this once on the weekend and be good for the week.  </li>
            <li> I even tried making my own sugaring paste.</li>
            <li> After much research and youtube videos, this seemed like the best one.</li>
            <li> I have to admit the massage heads seemed like they&#x27;d feel nice,</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quiet, does a great job lifting even the smallest hairs and the best part</li>
            <li> The fast charge time &amp; the length it holds the charge are wonderful.  </li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;I liked it..</li>
            <li> I had used an epilator years ago and while it was effective it did not perform like the Phillips.</li>
            <li> I bought the latest version and expec t time effecient and good effect, however, neither satisfies me.</li>
            <li> The attachments are nice.</li>
            <li> Honest.</li>
            <li> I really liked the effect on my underarm.</li>
            <li> And the fact that all you want to do is jerk your hand away from your own leg doesn&#x27;t help speed up the process.</li>
            <li> any day!ng hair it was pulling skin, but the nice thing about this product is</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m kind of a klutz with a razor).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Basically, it&#x27;s an epilator that works and, honestly,</li>
            <li> She liked the product and I would recommend.</li>
            <li> This is a really nice epilator.</li>
            <li> I have the kind of hair that looks like it has 5 o&#x27;clock shadow immediately.</li>
            <li> Honestly, I knew this was not the issue because you could hear the charger making noise as it was giving off charge, but I went along with it.</li>
            <li> There are lots of parts, so it&#x27;s nice that Philips includes a breathable bag to keep everything</li>
            <li> ceramic head on this is really nice.</li>
            <li> I really liked the shaving head</li>
            <li> , it gets the job done perfectly and it is easy to clean.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so nice to go on vacation without razors and not to purchase razors anymore.</li>
            <li> GREAT SERVICE &amp; GREAT PRODUCT, THANKS</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is nicely water resistant and washes/cleans well too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m loving this product and for anyone that&#x27;s scared to use it, just go for it.</li>
            <li> Absolutely one of the best epilators!</li>
            <li> I liked it a lot.</li>
            <li> So it&#x27;s darn effective.</li>
            <li> BUT, it takes the hair off easily and effectively!</li>
            <li> are great and useful!</li>
            <li> With this one in particular, the &amp;#34;massager&amp;#34; attachment with the plastic rollers on both sides works best.</li>
            <li> Philips satin perfect epilator is my new choice of hair removal.</li>
            <li> and now I&#x27;m super happy to be saving this for others</li>
            <li> It is a great attachment for those days that you are on the go and need something quick.</li>
            <li> I bought this one because it seemed to have good reviews, and I liked the idea of a light.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very easy to use once you figure out which attachment is for what.  </li>
            <li> This product was very easy to use.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very strong and very easy to use.</li>
            <li> dont want to give you an idea that its very easy and painless.</li>
            <li> but if epilation gives me many ingrown hairs I may have to discontinue use even though I absolutely love not having to shave every 2 days!</li>
            <li> It comes with super cute tweezers with light in it to help you see the smallest hairs, perfect for eyebrows.</li>
            <li> first thing I noticed about the epilator before even taking it out of the box was the beautiful design.</li>
            <li> From this, you can get a good grip and can control precise motions.</li>
            <li> I also would have liked it better if there was a grip piece on both sides.</li>
            <li> I would also recommend the deluxe model, as you are getting a multifunctional tool (epilator and shaver) that you will absolutely love.</li>
            <li> Now, for the pros like myself: this is by far the best epilator I have owned.</li>
            <li> However, with time it HONESTLY does get better.  </li>
            <li> I am still against the idea of using the epilator on my sensitive areas (bikini area and underarms), but my Philip satin perfect epilator has a shaving attachment for that.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Bright light on the shaver/epilator.  </li>
            <li> Nice if you paid for it and weren&#x27;t sure if you&#x27;d like it or if you are concerned about it breaking or wearing out.&lt;br /&gt;9)</li>
            <li> The tweezer sure is nice though.</li>
            <li> All I know is that it hurts and it works good, according to my wife, and she loves the tweezers with the light.</li>
            <li> The razor attachment is a nice addition, but honestly I haven&#x27;t had to use it much as the epilator head does a great job, so not a lot of touch up is needed.  </li>
            <li> Works wonderfull, the best shaver I have owned so far.</li>
            <li> 17 year old daughter loves the Satin Perfect Epilator too.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> great this is useful for me.</li>
            <li> I like the light, although it still helps to do this in a bright area, because you still miss some.  </li>
            <li> If you have never used an epilator before it might be wise to buy a used, cheap model to see if you can handle it, and upgrade once you get used to it....</li>
            <li> I like this epilator because I can do by myself, easily and fast, any time I want, and the price is great!</li>
            <li> you can just buzz it right off, and it looks and feels great.</li>
            <li> If your hair has grown out a while the trimmer works great for getting to the right length before removing the hair.  </li>
            <li> Easy!  </li>
            <li> I love, love, love it!</li>
            <li> (I hope!)&lt;br /&gt;Edited: It&#x27;s been 4 years, and is still going strong!</li>
            <li> I love love love this epilator!</li>
            <li> The illuminating smart tweezers are so great they deserve their own paragraph.</li>
            <li> The tweezer sure is nice though. :)</li>
            <li> It is extremely accurate and the incorporated light is great help.</li>
            <li> Best to use when you get out of the shower or use a warm rag to open the pores.</li>
            <li> Bright light on the shaver/epilator helps see so many hairs that would get missed</li>
            <li> Got this for Christmas, I love the bright LED light, it has 2 speeds, and all the interchangeable heads etc.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall: I cannot speak for all epilators (this is my first), but I can gather from my personal experience [with the Philips Satin Perfect Deluxe Epilator (HP6576/50)] that this is a great epilator.</li>
            <li> This is my first epilator and its great.</li>
            <li> Works great- my first epilator.</li>
            <li> I was pretty happy with the Remington until I bought this Philips HP6576.</li>
            <li> It is a pretty color, great design in terms of the handle.</li>
            <li> because I&#x27;m pretty happy with the product, just not with the frequency I have to use it</li>
            <li> First of all, great customer service as always.</li>
            <li> The fact that it can be used while charging is really good, I like it as I can never finish a full hair epilation session with one charge (was a prolem for me with the Braun).&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> This thing really gets to business, cleans up easily, and is rechargeable so the cord never gets in the way!!!</li>
            <li> a very smooth finish.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is very comfortable.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is very comfortable, and the name states &amp;#34;for skin that is always smooth&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> My underarms are very smooth..</li>
            <li> My girls legs are smooth, love it!</li>
            <li> The light is shines on the area being worked is quite nice.  </li>
            <li> it is a puss to get better when it&#x27;s come to touch it or looking at my legs , under arm or bikini area</li>
            <li> It works better if you pull the skin taut because it seems like the pain is more from skin pulling in curvy areas rather than the hair coming out.  </li>
            <li> can&#x27;t say I love it yet until I know what my skin will feel like tomorrow or how my legs will fare.  </li>
            <li> I do love that there is no mess.ll fare.  </li>
            <li> If it reduces hair growth then that pain is bearable :)</li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;m very happy with the product</li>
            <li> THE PHILLIPS is 1000 times better.  </li>
            <li> I AM SO PLEASED.  </li>
            <li> the sharper the better.</li>
            <li> The feel of the epilator is okay, but I think Philips could have done better.</li>
            <li> However, after using the epilator for a while, I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> Okay -- maybe more because of my explanation.</li>
            <li> I feel that if the massagers were self-rotating, this would provide even more comfort when epilating.</li>
            <li> Aside from that, I really love the attachment.</li>
            <li> There is an \\&quot;OptiLight\\&quot; - which initially seems great because it never seems we can get good lighting to pluck and maintain our eyebrows.</li>
            <li> This is great because it is no longer a hassle to go very close to a bathroom mirror for those stubborn hairs.</li>
            <li> The charger seems really cheap; it is really light (which could be a good thing for some) and made out of plastic.</li>
            <li> I wish the appearance - material and shape - had been better.</li>
            <li> Both my wife and I love the results.</li>
            <li> Satisfied</li>
            <li> This is the most use I have gotten out of the product.</li>
            <li> After using it consecutively, over a period of time, I have found the pain is much more bearable.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I LOVE these tweezers.</li>
            <li> Also, the light on the epillator is amazing in my opinion.</li>
            <li> And if you like electric shavers too, then all the more power to this product.</li>
            <li> Love this epilator.  </li>
            <li> I am in love.</li>
            <li> Okay here I go....</li>
            <li> After inspection the epilator did miss many hairs.</li>
            <li> tweezers are still my favorite</li>
            <li> and I love to carry them around with me everywhere</li>
            <li> tweezers are still my favorite</li>
            <li> and I love to carry them around with me everywhere</li>
            <li> And many people stopped using them.  </li>
            <li> Ok, I&#x27;m going to start off by saying I bought this on eBay because I could get it cheaper.</li>
            <li> The red spots stayed for about an hour or two, so it&#x27;s best to do this before bed.</li>
            <li> so you can get smoother more controlled motions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It takes more passes over a hairy area than his does (we compared)</li>
            <li> With its nice edge comb and all though I found this a FANTASTIC shaver...</li>
            <li> but I love the tweezer.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;1) Not waterproof or safe to use in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;2)</li>
            <li> It closes pores so it probably does more damage, but it also makes the hair stand up</li>
            <li> it might be getting better.  </li>
            <li> Cons:  1) Not waterproof or safe to use in the shower.  </li>
            <li> :)    </li>
            <li> It closes pores so it probably does more damage, but it also makes the hair stand up</li>
            <li> it might be getting better.  </li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Some hairs break off instead of being pulled out, but it is OK.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Glad I did, it did sting on my legs and arms.  </li>
            <li> More than waxing, but if you hold the skin taunt, it lessens the discomfort and if you move continuously, you get used to the pain.</li>
            <li> Plus it&#x27;s faster and more convenient than waxing.</li>
            <li> A bunch of attachments come with this amazing tool plus some fabulous tweezers.</li>
            <li> It gets much, much more tolerable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I received this product free from BzzAgent to test and give my honest opinions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love this one.</li>
            <li> The discs are able to grab shorter hairs.</li>
            <li> The simplest braun epilator I had did its job much better.</li>
            <li> Many epilators out there do not work while plugged in.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad that din&#x27;t care the pain.</li>
            <li> I went through many options and after reading the reviews I chose this one.</li>
            <li> However, I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li> The results are more like shaving, not epilating.</li>
            <li> I bought it because the Emjois seem to break after a couple of years and was hoping that a Philips would be a better quality product.</li>
            <li> Okay so, here we go</li>
            <li> truly appreciate the light!  </li>
            <li> but its brocken (2 years is ok).</li>
            <li> im completly sure that it is &amp;#34;sickness&amp;#34; of this product.</li>
            <li> It helps to see better the hair.</li>
            <li> and I must say that Braun epilator is way much better then Phillips&#x27; one.</li>
            <li> but I still feel like the results are better than shaving.</li>
            <li> found it works best if the hair is only about an 1/8th of an inch</li>
            <li> The ceramic discs are way better than the metal ones, I tried both and couldn&#x27;t support the epilator with metal.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much better than wax or shaving and save $$$.  </li>
            <li> As some others note, the lighted tweezers that come with it are surprisingly useful and good even though it seems a bit like a gimmick at first.&lt;br</li>
            <li> With the finer hairs though you do need to let them grow in, the longer the better.</li>
            <li> more practical for vacation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> would recommend this product for someone who is looking for a good powerful and durable epilator.</li>
            <li> I love this epilator.</li>
            <li> I use it everywhere! :)</li>
            <li> If you want a good epilator I would not recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;Seems to stayed charge for extended amount of time and is fairly easy to clean.</li>
            <li> I saw many reviews with people complaining that it hurts a lot.</li>
            <li> Much better than the Braun epilator.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that I can use it cordless</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m fully satisfied.</li>
            <li> I just LOve it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Phillips is fantastic!</li>
            <li> i had read many of the reviews.</li>
            <li> The most satisfactory epilator that I have ever found for a women, covering arms, legs, (not bikini) but just about all else!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> product is all and more than it promises to be.&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li> be sure to generously moisturize that part of your body on which you have used it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love everything about this model.</li>
            <li> I just wish the bag to carry all of the gadgets would be of better quality.</li>
            <li> Philips has designed a wonderful epilator with lots of accessories to make personal grooming easier and much more efficient.  </li>
            <li> It comes with a travel bag, and the light is really handy as well.</li>
            <li> I like this epilator better than any one I have ever had.  </li>
            <li> and I was finally able to finish most parts of both legs.</li>
            <li> the front top of my thighs was the worst.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Could have come with much more insurrections.</li>
            <li> But I am confident in time</li>
            <li> Love the rechargeable battery aspect.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this method of hair removel for many years</li>
            <li> It is a lot better then shaving or waxing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love it because I can use it on my legs, underarm and even face.</li>
            <li> I also love that it&#x27;s cordless</li>
            <li> Give it some time, practice with the different attachments to see which one works best for you.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Just be sure you check that all the attachments listed in the manual are there.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve used several epilator brands and this is one of the best I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> reviews on pain factor are many a times baseless with nothing to compare it to.</li>
            <li> , battery life could be better, cleaning brush needs improvement</li>
            <li> Although the epilator does get rid of most of my hair, it does not get rid of it all.&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Conclusion: Even though I&#x27;m still struggling to use this, I still find it more beneficial than shaving every couple of days.</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> I know that&#x27;s probably not a deciding factor for most people</li>
            <li> Somehow, this epilator is able to remove hairs from my underarm without touching the skin tag I have there.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that I can use this epilator while it&#x27;s charging.</li>
            <li> I found a lady in town who could do sugaring, which is MUCH better than waxing.</li>
            <li> so glad</li>
            <li> love it.&lt;br /&gt;Epilating doesn&#x27;t hurt me anymore,</li>
            <li> I found a lady in town who could do sugaring, which is MUCH better than waxing.</li>
            <li> so glad</li>
            <li> love it.&lt;br /&gt;Epilating doesn&#x27;t hurt me anymore,</li>
            <li> ok, this thing HURTS like well</li>
            <li> Love it!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have not braved using this device on parts I am not mentioning,:) Just not that brave.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li> and I love the removable head for cleaning.</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> It removes the hairs by an ingenious plucking motion.</li>
            <li> that it&#x60;s not made in China but in Bosnia &amp; Herzegovina and Slovenia,which I trust more.</li>
            <li> I am satisfied with my order and I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> It gives a better and long-lasting result.</li>
            <li> I got this epilator on Ebay after reading many reviews.</li>
            <li> Hair has to be about 1/4 inch to be pulled and since each hair grows at different rates, making this a part of your morning routine is best.</li>
            <li> but now I love it.</li>
            <li> case cracked and would not turn on or take a charge after dropping... will see if replacement is any better...</li>
            <li> around satisfied with it</li>
            <li> Many ppl have posted that eventually the pain will either diminish or you build a tolerance to it.</li>
            <li> x however more hair you have),</li>
            <li> This takes much more time too.</li>
            <li> The best part of the epilator is not having to shave daily.</li>
            <li> 5 stars for sure.</li>
            <li> and I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> The packaging: it was shipped in an envelop-like package, the box was torn and I am so glad the epilator itself wasn&#x27;t</li>
            <li> I suppose it did not work best for me, but I am happy that at least it is not pinching my skin!&lt;br /&gt;Next</li>
            <li> /&gt;Before I got an epilator, I used either use an electric razor or more preferably, wax.</li>
            <li> make sure to moisturize and exfoliate, unless you want ingrown</li>
            <li> /&gt;Light and battery - 5 stars :)</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s my favorite</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with this</li>
            <li> I love the results</li>
            <li> A piece of elastic got caught up in the mechanism, and then continued to tangle as more and more of the elastic thread got pulled out (</li>
            <li> , okay?).  </li>
            <li> , the result is a lot better than even waxing!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The disks in the Philips create more of a sensation as they spin against the skin</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was hesitant to buy this model because of the price and now I&#x27;m glad I bought it anyway.  </li>
            <li> love this product…highly recommend this</li>
            <li> I have no issues with it since I love</li>
            <li> Regardless, I love the product.</li>
            <li> She had a cheaper one for many years and it was ok</li>
            <li> glad I did.</li>
            <li> I had to go over the area more than once, over and over and over.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Light: I love the light!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Satin:))</li>
            <li> It works better over time.</li>
            <li> It did do some damage to my skin because it seems to take of the top layer, but leaves the hair.  </li>
            <li> Love this product.  </li>
            <li> Philips is a reliable company that has been around for many, many more years than the others.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> but now I love it.</li>
            <li> Wish it picked up a bit more hair.</li>
            <li> I noticed that it creates more ingrown hairs on my legs compared to shaving.</li>
            <li> What I love about it is the curved shape of the blade.  </li>
            <li> I am glad I bought it.</li>
            <li> This works better than I had hoped.</li>
            <li> I originally purchased it for the epilator, but also liked the added electric razor/trimmer accessories.</li>
            <li> being able to go this long without shaving is wonderful.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t have that kind of time or can&#x27;t deal with a week of patchiness, just get waxed, and then start using this for stray clean up post waxing.  </li>
            <li> This literally keeps my legs super smooth for a good 3-4 weeks.</li>
            <li> I was lucky enough to be able to try the Philips Satin Perfect Epilator for free courtesy of Bzzagent.com (check them out, love them[...])!    </li>
            <li> I have been using an epilator for a while with pretty good results</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used epilation for years &amp; just needed a new one.&lt;br /&gt;The epilator works great</li>
            <li> Luckily I had this amazing targeted gel lotion called [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> You see so many hairs that would get easily overlooked</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quick and effective.</li>
            <li> The light is not positioned in the best place and it reflects yellow shade (I thought I had bruises on my legs before I realized</li>
            <li> It gets better and more smooth with each day I use it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice having the light on the tweezers, but the tweezers are cheap and don&#x27;t work well.  </li>
            <li> It was very easy to clean as instructed.  </li>
            <li> Very easy to clean</li>
            <li> It charges great and the different heads are very easy to change.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The light is not so useful during epilation, but is very handy for quickly looking over the job to find the hairs that were missed.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m very happy with this product and consider it money well spent.</li>
            <li> No matter how many times I try to motivate myself to use the tweezers, I cannot find a way to utilize them so that I am not blinded by the light.</li>
            <li> At first I was very satisfied.  </li>
            <li> I love the light.</li>
            <li> /&gt;the built in light is most appreciated.&lt;br /&gt;Has</li>
            <li> It has a light to help you see the lighter hairs better.  </li>
            <li> DESIGN and EASE OF USE: Just a brilliant and simple product.</li>
            <li> I do it real quick and my body is smooth for weeks.</li>
            <li> This one is even better with the light and cordless operation.</li>
            <li> I love the build in light, makes it easier to use.</li>
            <li> but the Philips is much more comfortable and works faster.  </li>
            <li> Love the fact that it has a light</li>
            <li> I do not care much for this; the concept is good, but I find my cheap 99 cent tweezers from Dillions does a better job.</li>
            <li> I like that it will work while plugged in if needed but with fast charge &amp; good hold time that may not be necessary.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> you have more peach fuzz than you wish the day of something more important, the included razor is fantastic.  </li>
            <li> The epilator runs very well on a charge but runs corded, too, and the cord is fairly long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Charges fast and holds on for a good amount of time.</li>
            <li> love it so much I have purchased two of them!!!</li>
            <li> This ceramic one more quickly rips most if not all of the hairs out for longer results.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The most significant problem I&#x27;ve had is with ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li> awesome product I have used other operators epilators and</li>
            <li> This works well, is easy to use and maintain.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Though the epilator itself works very well, the bonus attachments that come with the deluxe model provide a more optimal performance.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and effective.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Easy to use and effective.&lt;br</li>
            <li> ) Easy to use.  </li>
            <li> The clean up is so easy, and it makes me feel better about being sanitary.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Just make sure to clean after each use.</li>
            <li> Between all the epilators I went through the years, this is by far the absolute best.</li>
            <li> This works quite well, charges very quickly, and can be used cordless or when plugged in.  </li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s easy now.</li>
            <li> Easy to hold and maneuver&lt;</li>
            <li> The head is easy to remove/rinse.  </li>
            <li> That is easy to confirm while removing hairs by both.</li>
            <li> It comes with a travel bag for easy carrying.</li>
            <li> In my opinion, this hurts a lot more than waxing, but it does a great job, and the hair takes forever to grow back.  </li>
            <li> The motor is strong and does not yield to stubborn hairs.</li>
            <li> My old one worked okay, but it took dozens of passes, and a good hour, to get my lower legs done.  </li>
            <li> I would strongly discourage from using it on the face.</li>
            <li> Very fast &amp; effective.</li>
            <li> I skimmed most of it, but kept having to try look things up to make sure I was doing it right</li>
            <li> I skimmed most of it, but kept having to try look things up to make sure I was doing it right</li>
            <li> The fact you can use this with the cord, which is super long, is wonderful!  </li>
            <li> It is like waxing, in terms of the removal results, but without the ongoing cost, AND more importantly, the ability to clean up strays in between.  </li>
            <li> Works best for underarms, less painfull than wax for underarms also very quick,   Hurts for bikini area.   </li>
            <li> Spending a bit more money with the deluxe model will grant you a few bonuses, but the product works really well by itself (Philips HP6576/60 Satin Perfect Epilator).</li>
            <li> When it&#x27;s plugged in it works fine</li>
            <li> It hurt the first time i did it but gets more and more tolerable.</li>
            <li> I have baby fine hair, so I don&#x27;t have any pain.</li>
            <li> /&gt;i have owned a philips epilator for 12 years and is still working fine.</li>
            <li> I also used the shaver head which works fine</li>
            <li> It is easy to use and comfortable to hold.</li>
            <li> The trimming head works fine.</li>
            <li> I must not have read the fine print.</li>
            <li> This epilator works fine.</li>
            <li> so you can see the fine hairs.</li>
            <li> Downside is it doesn&#x27;t get the fine hairs.</li>
            <li> Some quick math would show that you probably spend about $130 or more a year on those.</li>
            <li> I like it because it is so quick and feels better.</li>
            <li> More of a mild irritation.  </li>
            <li> your legs really do feel smoother and look more satiny!</li>
            <li> VERY WELL, LOVE THE ITEM, RECOMMEND IT !</li>
            <li> They are easy to remove and fairly easy to clean.</li>
            <li> After reading several positive reviews, I decided to give the Philips Shave Perfect a try.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Another bonus that comes with the deluxe model is the Illuminating Smart Tweezers.</li>
            <li> I have had my Philips satin perfect epilator for a little longer than a month.</li>
            <li> But with the shorter course hairs,I was impressed at how little growth I needed to grab them by the root&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use, and again build in light, very helpful!</li>
            <li> The product is environmentally friendly, saves time, and will pay for itself very quickly.  </li>
            <li> I opened the tube to find a micro mirror perfect for on the go tweezing and then I flipped the little LED light on.</li>
            <li> Great epilator, works very good on legs, and I love the little light, it actually shows me the spots I missed.</li>
            <li> I have owned and tried dozens of these machines for the past 15 years and this one is by far the best - easiest to use and clean, smooth results and works great on legs, bikini line and arm pits :</li>
            <li> Then as it warmed in my hand, it stuck to my leg and gave me a HUGE bruise when I tried pull it off.</li>
            <li> It was a huge improvement over the cheaper epilator (Bliss spa) that I owned before.</li>
            <li> , it is a huge benefit to have the trimming option.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Finally, pain greatly diminishes on subsequent uses because there are fewer hairs each time you epilate.  </li>
            <li> Fantastic.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe how smooth my legs feel</li>
            <li> Also, this would replace all those cheap disposable razors you buy at Target.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care how much pain I have to get used to, this thing is amazing.</li>
            <li> The primary use for this product is epilation, i.e. uprooting of the hairs, which is done by tweezer-like rotating disks.</li>
            <li> I can honestly say that the massagers vibrating really took away from a lot of the pain.</li>
            <li> For under the arms, unless you are in front of a mirror, a light would not be as beneficial.  </li>
            <li> There is a set of tweezers that are included that contain a mirror and also a light.  </li>
            <li> I got smooth look.</li>
            <li> , it was almost like I never had smooth legs.</li>
            <li> Another thing I like is that you can use this while it is charging (great option actually) just can&#x27;t get it wet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Smooth...</li>
            <li> It just feels like my skin is being lightly scratched.</li>
            <li> Use an alcohol free lotion or antiseptic after using to soothe skin.  </li>
            <li> and I like the added feature of the light because it makes it easier to see hairs that I&#x27;ve missed.</li>
            <li> Now, enjoy those smooth legs for a week or two.  </li>
            <li> Another important thing for me was the ability to use it while it is plugged in.</li>
            <li> Thanks Philips for this amazing Epilator.</li>
            <li> Comfortable design,</li>
            <li> It works amazingly and doesn&#x27;t hurt as much a s</li>
            <li> can I have a free service to repair it?</li>
            <li> And honestly for me,  I would much rather endure an hour of discomfort than have to shave every morning in the shower.  </li>
            <li> They look completely smooth, and fantastic.  </li>
            <li> I also like the guiding light on it.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s not going to be pain free.  </li>
            <li> very noisy but really effective.</li>
            <li> And honestly I don&#x27;t even really care for the epilator attachment to this.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean</li>
            <li> When I woke up I had amazingly smooth legs.  </li>
            <li> The epilator body is comfortable to manipulate.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s implied that the hair is pulled out so the area will be smooth.</li>
            <li> but I felt that having it over faster was important as I&#x27;m a pain wimp.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for the upper lip too.  </li>
            <li> and my daughter loves the light up tweezers.</li>
            <li> The plus of this is it&#x27;s light and comfortable to hold.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> Easy to clean detachable heads.</li>
            <li> The light does help to find stubborn hairs</li>
            <li> I use it weekly just to keep my legs smooth</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t sit here and say it&#x27;s pain free...</li>
            <li> The shape is ergonomic and the light is helpful.  </li>
            <li> It does not bother me since I am not using it while my family watching a movie or doing homework or something.&lt;br /&gt;Design: comfortable to hold and light.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Skin feels smooth.</li>
            <li> liked the idea of ceramic disks and thought that sounded like a modern option as well.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy it and it doesn&#x27;t hurt at all.</li>
            <li> Everywhere that I epilated feels silky smooth now.</li>
            <li> The shape of the product fits comfortably in my hand.</li>
            <li> It does sound like a weed whacker, which I guess it is.  </li>
            <li> It is absolutely one of my most favorite scents.</li>
            <li> Immediately loved the difference of these disks versus the &amp;#34;tweezer&amp;#34; style of my old one.  </li>
            <li> Although this epilator did receive a lot of good reviews, some of the recent reviews made me think twice about spending more than $50 dollars on this product.</li>
            <li> The features and attachments are really cool and the bag and tweezers  are really cool too :)</li>
            <li> Skin feels so nice and smooth for much longer than after razor.</li>
            <li> Having only used this one, all I can say is this one is super nice in every way except that it hurts like crazy.wk...)  13) Seems very safe.  </li>
            <li> My leg hair grows about has fast as my husbands 5&#x27;oclock shadow, so I was very excited about the ability to not have to shave my legs every morning (something I feel like I spend a greater part of my week doing).&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Ok, then it also comes with a very smart tweezers with a led light too.</li>
            <li> More convenient than waxing with all the positive effects!</li>
            <li> It barely hurts my armpits but it still isn&#x27;t pleasant on my bikini area.</li>
            <li> There are a total of 4 attachments, each of which comes very handy.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t expect to use it on your face, however, as the facial hair removal touted is for the very nice, lighted tweezers included in the set.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this epilator is as thorough as the earlier model, but it is still very effective.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s best if you use this every other day and get the right touch.</li>
            <li> Then (I really love this part), a pretty battery shaped light will be lit on the front of the epilator.</li>
            <li> so they&#x27;re super easy to carry in your purse.</li>
            <li> /&gt;You can do armpits and legs in a heartbeat, super easy.</li>
            <li> new model hurts much more!</li>
            <li> The force/strength/power is the same when urged in or just charged, it is amazing!</li>
            <li> If I knew that it would be so great I had bought it a long time</li>
            <li> This is a unique feature that this shaver has.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Talking about just the epilator though, this one works better than my first one (emjoi caress or something like that.)  </li>
            <li> Definitely worth buying!</li>
            <li> And if you have waxed than you are familiar with the idea that you get use to this</li>
            <li> I tried other brands and models, but this one is really good!</li>
            <li> used the first time a couple days a go, and I am in love with it</li>
            <li> effect is much better that the cutter.&lt;br /&gt;Though it will cause a bit pain at the first time when using it.</li>
            <li> I was really excited upon ordering this epilator.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m sorta excited to do it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure the first time will be painful.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I like pretty things :)</li>
            <li> I was really excited to get this epilator through BzzAgent.com.</li>
            <li> If they could get rid of the \\&quot;yank\\&quot; when the hair is pulled it would be perfect (not sure how an engineer could design that though).</li>
            <li> The tweezers have a built-in light, which is cool.</li>
            <li> because i need this thing long time, and it is great.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s seriously worth it!</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the purchase!</li>
            <li> and I fell in love after the first use.</li>
            <li> The &#x27;grab&#x27; is very strong, so that&#x27;s good for removing the hairs, but be careful as it really hurts (more than a weaker grab epilator)</li>
            <li> I made sure my legs were clean and after using I took a hot shower and lathered up my legs with lotion before going to bed.  </li>
            <li> new model is not as effective removing hair.</li>
            <li> Quickly removes hair and the attachments are super cool!</li>
            <li> I do like the light as the emjoi doesn&#x27;t, but the overall performance I felt was not as good as I thought it would be.</li>
            <li> X&#x27;elle Body System Epilator]] which has metal disks that tear and damage your skin - thus I still had to wax some parts, which kinda defeats the purpose of owning an epilator for a quick and cheap at-home hair removal.  </li>
            <li> Brush - Used to clean your epilator after each use.   </li>
            <li> you want super smooth.  </li>
            <li> you want super smooth.  </li>
            <li> Can get most even now with an extra pass or a circle motion, but honestly those missed you can&#x27;t see</li>
            <li> clean look.  </li>
            <li> Just clean as instructed.</li>
            <li> It just arrived yesterday (a day early in fact), so I have only used it once, but I am very happy with this purchase and would buy again.</li>
            <li> suggest if at all possible to use weekly - the longer the hair the more apt to have a prickly feeling</li>
            <li> Just pop the head off like the directions say and it rinses clean in seconds.</li>
            <li> The head and attachments come apart and you can run them all under water to clean them.</li>
            <li> It takes me about 20 seconds to clean everything, then I set the pieces out to air-dry overnight.</li>
            <li> The bag it comes with to hold everything is super cheap.</li>
            <li> Love this Epilator omg so much better than my old one</li>
            <li> Upon first use I was pretty positive that instead of pulling hair it was pulling skin, but the nice thing about this product is when you pop off the top to clean it</li>
            <li> I read the reviews and most of them were positive, I decided to get one, and I just SO GRAEAT.</li>
            <li> I love it from the firs &amp;#34;view&amp;#34; and bc of a lot positive feedback .</li>
            <li> First of all, I was very lucky to have been sent this product to try for free from BzzAgent.  </li>
            <li> the rest (shaver, tweezer, etc) is very nice, I still like it as a shaver and will keep trying the epilator a few more times...</li>
            <li> the rest (shaver, tweezer, etc) is very nice, I still like it as a shaver and will keep trying the epilator a few more times...</li>
            <li> The shaver with the guard on it is very handy to get the hairs to the optimum length for the epilator head, especially when I wait a bit too long between sessions.</li>
            <li> I was expecting pain and torture along with bright red legs for hours and hours.</li>
            <li> Now let me just say, compared to my old 30$ Braun metal disc epilator, this one is amazing.</li>
            <li> - it&#x27;s a spinning head of tiny tweezers pulling out each hair at the root - did you expect it to feel good?  </li>
            <li> I find myself using it so much because it has so many functions.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never actually used an electric shaver before and found it to be surprisingly convenient.</li>
            <li> The Cool Fix Gel Lotion - 2 oz]].</li>
            <li> But to be hair free for 1-2 weeks is well worth it.</li>
            <li> Okay I was now prepped and ready.    </li>
            <li> I used this product regularly for a month to give it a fair shake</li>
            <li> this is smaller but fairly comparable in function.  </li>
            <li> It is fast, doesn&#x27;t require more than one pass (depending on amount of hair of course)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does</li>
            <li> After a week or two, you&#x27;ll notice some short hairs starting to poke out and ruin that wonderful smooth leg experience.  </li>
            <li> A good epilator will last you for years.  </li>
            <li> A full charge should give you 40 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it comes with a lot of attachments and a cool lighted tweeter and mirror compact.</li>
            <li> its cool.</li>
            <li> it works and its not painful.</li>
            <li> two was easier, as I think I was more ready for the pain than anything.</li>
            <li> a good charge, definitely enough to do both legs</li>
            <li> Good thing is that you can use it while charging (opposite to Braun epilator).</li>
            <li> This is true, after a couple weeks I was no longer sweating and shaking and stopping every 30 seconds while using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d probably use a cool pack after I do it, but the pinkness goes away after a couple of hours.</li>
            <li> I think this is the only good point of this product.</li>
            <li> The ceramic heads grab the hair very well, and do not cause as many ingrowns as metal heads I have used.</li>
            <li> I love that it runs off a battery making it much easier to operate.</li>
            <li> It does a good job but needs several times of application for a neat spot.</li>
            <li> I used the shaver in the armpits, which has a nice close shave, but I couldn&#x27;t get it to reach the area near my tendon, so I still have to use a razor there.  </li>
            <li> Since it arrived I have only used it once and was really good.</li>
            <li> but I still charged it completely before I did my own legs.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not bad at all.</li>
            <li> For the first time, go easy, work in segments so that you can see progress -- take your time.  </li>
            <li> A friend let me try her older version, which she swore by... and while &amp;#34;uncomfortable&amp;#34; at first, it&#x27;s much more easy and bearable than plucking a full face of hairs here and there with tweezers each week at the minimum for me, which also hurts.</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;pain&amp;#34; level is tons lower with this-to the point I might brave trying areas other than my legs.  </li>
            <li> I have another epilators from emjoi that works a little better, but wanted to try this one as the reviews were so good.  </li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t have a lot of hair, or it&#x27;s pretty fine</li>
            <li> The next one I buy, I&#x27;ll make sure it does a better job of pulling the hair out rather then breaking it.  </li>
            <li> More than enough power on the epilator for sure</li>
            <li> Really the whole thing just looks nice.  </li>
            <li> but you get used to it quickly.</li>
            <li> It is painless, works quickly, don&#x27;t have to fight with a cord.</li>
            <li> Charges quickly.  </li>
            <li> Easy to clean and a plug in recharger that charges fast.  </li>
            <li> Forty minutes are adequate.  </li>
            <li> It seemed the hair had to be the perfect length, and all my hair doesn&#x27;t grow at the same rate so this was not possible.</li>
            <li> Plus, I still haven&#x27;t tried doing a super exfoliation beforehand, maybe that will help as well?</li>
            <li> so I can get it over with as quickly as possible.&lt;br /&gt;4.</li>
            <li> finally chose the Philips Satin Perfect simply based on the fact that it looked the classiest, ha!&lt;br</li>
            <li> finally chose the Philips Satin Perfect simply based on the fact that it looked the classiest, ha!&lt;br</li>
            <li> This epilator is great - works fast, doesn&#x27;t break hair - pulls them out properly and works for about 45 min without charging.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great in that the area stays smoother for so much longer, plus the hair is thinner and grows back slower.</li>
            <li> If anyone has ever plucked their eyebrows, it feels like that sting but then quickly goes away.</li>
            <li> The fact that has so many and different heads and that it&#x27;s wireless makes it even better.</li>
            <li> only way more than one at a time, more like one after another after another in rapid</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Quick and Efficient</li>
            <li> These gloves are available at a very reasonable price on amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and if you ever used one of this epilators before you will find this one no painful at all... i use it on my legs, bikini and underarms with no problem, is very fast, the light really helps and the cleaning is super easy.</li>
            <li> Very accurate and efficient, charge lasts long time and led light makes it easy to use.</li>
            <li> The OptiLight allows you to see even the tiniest and lightest hairs(which is great for me because I have dark hair.)</li>
            <li> And exactly like what it would sound like, you will run the risk of damaging something.</li>
            <li> the kind that never fold back as nice as they were before you unfolded it like an unruly old style map.&lt;br /&gt;3) Can pop the head off while it&#x27;s in use.  </li>
            <li> the kind that never fold back as nice as they were before you unfolded it like an unruly old style map.  </li>
            <li> The epilator itself is very pretty, and the attachments all have a use.</li>
            <li> This one is very pretty and good-looking, but breaks off the hairs.</li>
            <li> /&gt;You should be aware that this does not give you a perfectly smooth silky leg like a razor</li>
            <li> First, the tweezer comes with a built in light, but mine didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> this is my favorite especially being cordless with a light And flexible head.the light up tweezers</li>
            <li> The unit itself also has a light on it, which really helps in the spa with subdued lighting!</li>
            <li> For hair that may be too long for optimum epilating, the trimming attachment could be used.</li>
            <li> The battery lasts quite well, it&#x27;s good for as long as I can go at it at a time and the charge indicator is well done.</li>
            <li> It comes with 3 different epilating attachments and a razor head with a trimmer, as well as a great cleaning brush and awesome light-up tweezers and everything fits in the little white bag that it comes with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!!ey, but you will get more than your moneys worth with this.  </li>
            <li> I have this epilator for 1 year now, and it has some real pros: lithium battery which makes it wireless and usable anywhere and a very very useful led light that points to the right spot of your skin when removing the hairs.</li>
            <li> I bought this new version and found out it is getting better.</li>
            <li> I just love this new version.</li>
            <li> I have been epilating for many years now and wanted to try something new.  </li>
            <li> The new one works even better.  </li>
            <li> This product was good only for the first weeks.</li>
            <li> This epilator even grabs very short hairs and is just perfect since you don&#x27;t have to wait too long for the hair to grow out.</li>
            <li> It is fast, easy and gets the job done.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t hurt much the first time either, and the results are fantastic!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thorough, easy to use, sleek, and appears to be very well built.  </li>
            <li> I especially like that this tool has a light on it to make it easy to see fine hairs.</li>
            <li> my first thought was Ouch!</li>
            <li> BUT IT HURTS A LOT, REALLY HURTS!!</li>
            <li> Overall the unit is stylish, easy to use, ergonomically designed.  </li>
            <li> by.&lt;br /&gt;The lighted tweezers included with this deluxe set helped my husband quickly find &amp; remove a tiny metal</li>
            <li> It has super speed and light, and you can use it on your bathtub which is very convenient.</li>
            <li> I pulls out the finer, smaller hair more easily as compared to speed</li>
            <li> I would love this product more if it got the super short hairs, really it&#x27;s stubble.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll admit that in an area where you can stand to use it, the epilator does a fantastic job of leaving behind a very smooth surface...nearly as good as waxing.  </li>
            <li> The sound that comes out of this little guy is so surprisingly that it scared me to use it.</li>
            <li> Since the epilator has an LED light on it, I was able to spot most of the little hairs that maybe I would have missed otherwise.</li>
            <li> My Braun epilator I used to have was about 30 dollars, so fairly cheap, this one not so much.</li>
            <li> This product worked great for a few weeks.</li>
            <li> this is a great solution to wanting those non hairy legs and not having the time or desire to shave each morning or even every few days.  </li>
            <li> and i really like the light.</li>
            <li> The different heads and attachments are a nice addition, and I think they may be helpful to someone who is more sensitive to the pain.</li>
            <li> hairs!&lt;br /&gt;-I&#x27;m not so much of a fan of the light.</li>
            <li> real, real improvement!&lt;br /&gt;Why?&lt;br</li>
            <li> the built in light is also very helpful.  </li>
            <li> Definitely not painLESS but effective.</li>
            <li> The ol&#x27; razor blade wins again.</li>
            <li> feel that some people would not care about this, but I think it something worth mentioning.</li>
            <li> The white bag is really handy.</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;m not convinced that that shave is worth the price</li>
            <li> Worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> Now the fun part</li>
            <li> The two main heads were easy to put on, however, it took some getting used to in order to add the massage rollers.  </li>
            <li> Again, useful for seeing hairs that may be missed.  </li>
            <li> , it is a well designed and useful shaver.</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t speak yet to how it holds up over time, but so far I am pleased.  </li>
            <li> Overall this product is really nice in what it is supposed to do.</li>
            <li> just so it looks more natural.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quite powerful and has two speeds.  </li>
            <li> That aspect alone is well worth the price difference for me.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
            <li> , din&#x27;t shave for a month to get them waxes in the spa, but even they make fun of me.</li>
            <li> this is worth every penny you spend.</li>
            <li> nice to carry around in your purse for last min touch ups.</li>
            <li> And if I am going to endure this kind of pain, than I want to do it as inexpensively as possible.  </li>
            <li> The accessories that come with it are really useful.</li>
            <li> It is worth the pain.</li>
            <li> It’s worth it.</li>
            <li> With no pain, the price is worth it.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t worth the money.</li>
            <li> But that&#x27;s pulling out years worth of growth.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Tweezer they gave is nice, but not necessary</li>
            <li> And completely worth it when it negates all those parlor visits for waxing.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It comes with these incredible mirror/flashlight/tweezers, but then they give you the flimsiest, most useless piece of fabric to hold it all in.</li>
            <li> but i do not think it would be worth paying 100 dollars for.</li>
            <li> IMO, worth it.</li>
            <li> but it is worth...</li>
            <li> Worth the money</li>
            <li> In the old model the heads were/are metallic and the rotation movement was/is more soft.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Its worth every penny I spend on it.</li>
            <li> So far, I love it.  </li>
            <li> : it&#x27;s an epilator, it hurts, because it pulls your hairs and specially in most sensitive areas (under arms and bikini area).</li>
            <li> Thought of trying the advertised wonder hair remover that&#x27;s advertised every hour on tv but didn&#x27;t think it was worth the $200 price tag.  </li>
            <li> If I could have withstood the pain, it would be worth it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quite powerful and has two speeds.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> It seems to maneuver better than my old one.  </li>
            <li> Better than my old one.  </li>
            <li> The multiple heads give a more comfortable shave.</li>
            <li> The trimmer is worth it if you don&#x27;t feel like ripping your hair off one day or just want to do some touch ups.  </li>
            <li> In fact, after the first time, it&#x27;s really not bad at all.  </li>
            <li> I plan to continue using this wonderful little device, especially considering how clean it leaves my legs.</li>
            <li> I do love that there is no mess.</li>
            <li> I basically remove *all* the visible hair below my waist line, and this thing is very friendly to the sensitive areas, since it has ceramic disks.</li>
            <li> Always works much better than waxing and there is  no mess afterwards</li>
            <li> From other girls who have used this products, they told me that the more you use it, the more you get used to.</li>
            <li> I would probably never use the epilator on the pits but it&#x27;s good on other areas</li>
            <li> I would probably never use the epilator on the pits but it&#x27;s good on other areas</li>
            <li> Ouch it hurts so much, but it is worth, it takes 3 weeks for hair to grow!</li>
            <li> (if I am already epilating this is a pain) and look at the front to see if I am in the right speed setting.</li>
            <li> started on the bottom of my right leg, and yes, it did hurt some.</li>
            <li> has this product on sale right now, which was why I bought it</li>
            <li> Amazon has this product on sale right now, which was why I bought it</li>
            <li> Yep, it hurt, but I thought, maybe there&#x27;s something I&#x27;m not doing quite right.</li>
            <li> They are sending out the part right away.</li>
            <li> You can hear the hairs being caught when you&#x27;re doing it right.</li>
            <li> I find the &amp;#34;discomfort&amp;#34; level pretty ignorable on my arms and legs, but problematic on more sensitive areas like my belly.</li>
            <li> The Philips is much easier to clean.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s in a little lipstick like tube and has a super bright LED for plucking.  </li>
            <li> This Satin Perfect Epilator, however it&#x27;s different than others, (maybe the fact that the discs are ceramic instead of metal?) has not been causing that problem in the month and a half I&#x27;ve been using it.  </li>
            <li> May not have to do an epilator as often but took more total time than a quick shave with a razor every day.  </li>
            <li> I had another very old Philips Epilator and, in comparison, this one so much faster and more convenient/ easier to use because it&#x27;s cordless.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;d use it all the time, but with the really bright light and ability to shave dry, I could really see the usefulness for when one needs a quick clean up on the legs or pits but doesn&#x27;t have time to properly hop in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you have used epilators in the past and are looking for an upgrade, this is a great device.</li>
            <li> love the light on the epilator, really helps at getting at the smaller hairs&lt;br /&gt;Holds</li>
            <li> I have light colored hair and its also not terribly thick.</li>
            <li> The long cord on the charger comes in handy depending on where your electrical outlets are placed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Nice storage bag holds everything including the long cord.  </li>
            <li> Honestly, in the pictures of those epilators they look like some sort of strange torture devices.</li>
            <li> Seemed to work better with a very light touch then firmly pressed against the skin.  </li>
            <li> It did slightly hurt on the first use, but does get better with more use.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s true that hurts a lot using it, but the result is worth all the pain: my arms and legs are so soft!!</li>
            <li> Definitely more comfortable than expected.  </li>
            <li> have experienced some ingrown hairs that present like tiny pimples.  </li>
            <li> (I think a good wet/dry shaver alone costs less than this device).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Light is actually more helpful than I expected.</li>
            <li> I had had the same epilator for years and it worked great, that´s way I decided to buy the same one.</li>
            <li> Epilator is not for everyone, but if you can stomach the pain, you do not have to waste money on many many</li>
            <li> Also, what I noticed is that it&#x60;s way lighter than my previous epilators which is good for me because I travel a lot.</li>
            <li> Plus, you have to warm the wax up so often, it&#x27;s really takes an entire afternoon to do your legs!</li>
            <li> What I like about this epilator is that it&#x60;s cordless,includes razor head, has a good opti-light,four attachments and a pair of illuminating smart tweezers in a nice white little bag.</li>
            <li> Very loud Even the shaver attachment just &amp;#34;trims&amp;#34; it by no means leaves you smooth...</li>
            <li> okay this seems to be getting a little more tolerable with the occasional pulls hurting more than others.</li>
            <li> It works a lot better, pulls really small hairs and is easy to clean.</li>
            <li> I like it very much.</li>
            <li> and that is very fast.</li>
            <li> First of all, using just one button for everything will wear down the epilator more easily.</li>
            <li> in a little lipstick like tube and has a bright LED for plucking.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little pricey, but it does a good job so for me</li>
            <li> Seems to do a good job with little pain.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use, the battery autonomy is better than the previous model</li>
            <li> I bought this as a replacement for an older model phillips, love it so far.  </li>
            <li> The strong grab is what I like though, less ingrowns (also do use a scratchy pad to exfoliate in the shower every day) and quicker, better hair removal.</li>
            <li> It is exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li> FIRST, let me say that the first time you use this, IT WILL HURT.  </li>
            <li> Before the first use, I let the hair on my legs grow out quite a bit and then trimmed with the included shaver head to the suggested length for optimal epilation (in the instruction manual).  </li>
            <li> I wish I had bought this one in the first place.  </li>
            <li> The epilator hasn&#x27;t slipped from my hands yet during epilating, but an actual grip would provide better security.</li>
            <li> Even in a well-lit room, the OptiLight never fails to impress me.</li>
            <li> The packaging of the tweezers is okay, but not terrific.</li>
            <li> The thing I am most worried about is the actual epilator.</li>
            <li> I will most likely use the pouch for the attachments and the charger, and will probably use a separate makeup bag to storemy epilator.</li>
            <li> She uses it several times a week, and we&#x27;re already saving money not having to purchase so many razors and shaving accessories.</li>
            <li> Worked very well for me.&lt;br /&gt;Accesories make the difference!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t often have to charge it, and if for some reason I do have to charge while in use, the cord is pretty long.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> I recommend using the trim attachment first to leave the hair a uniform length before using the epilator, if you have it.</li>
            <li> That may seem like a lot at first</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need to sit in a very well lit place to touch up your brows anymore!</li>
            <li> My first reaction was \\&quot;Holy</li>
            <li> That may scare anyone off at first</li>
            <li> My old one didn&#x27;t have a light</li>
            <li> In all honesty epilating will hurt at first.  </li>
            <li> Showering or taking a hot bath beforehand makes all the difference in the world.  </li>
            <li> I chose to use the Optimal Performance Cap since this was my first time ever using an epilator.</li>
            <li> First pass</li>
            <li> shaving attachment was awesome--at first.</li>
            <li> Although this one does incorporate the same technique of pulling the hair from the root, it does it with a lot more comfort and ease.  </li>
            <li> I tried it on my legs, I started using it while it was charging for the first time, convenient.</li>
            <li> It pulls out majority of hair on first pass.</li>
            <li> but sometimes it is getting to hot when I&#x27;m using that</li>
            <li> This is the first epilator I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li> It is waaay faster than my old cheap brand epilator</li>
            <li> They sounded like machines created by the devil himself, but I was willing to try it.</li>
            <li> I love the different attachments, and the tweezers.</li>
            <li> : I forgot to mention this the first time I posted my review.  </li>
            <li> As much as I&#x27;d like to reserve it for eyebrows, the sucker is a great tweezer and just seems so darn useful</li>
            <li> Even though I&#x27;m most likely to use this as a shaver, I like that the epilator is an option.  </li>
            <li> it was pretty intuitive.  </li>
            <li> Hot shower beforehand doesn&#x27;t help either.  </li>
            <li> Hot shower beforehand doesn&#x27;t help either.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t hurt at all after the first time.</li>
            <li> First ever epilator</li>
            <li> It hurts at first</li>
            <li> The amount of pain that an epilator will cause you is directly related to how many hairs it&#x27;s yanking out.  </li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s pretty neat that you can use the device for both shaving and epilating.  </li>
            <li> Decided to try something more fancy but regretted it, for some reason it doesn&#x27;t come close enough and leaves all the roots.</li>
            <li> shaver attachment is pretty nifty.  </li>
            <li> I really need one!</li>
            <li> Bought this as a replacement to a different manufacturer/model after reading many of the reviews.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> It is my first epilator purchase, so there has been a trial and error period in my learning curve.</li>
            <li> But also i love the shaver attachment if you cant deal with the pain like me on my upper thighs and arms</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s no worse!</li>
            <li> will, but unless you are rubbing your hands (or your sweetheart is) up your leg, you would not know your legs aren&#x27;t completely razor smooth.  </li>
            <li> the first time.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Takes pass after pass to get most of the hair so not a quicker alternative to daily shaving.  </li>
            <li> The first day using it on my underarms</li>
            <li> It is exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> Also, by being wireless, it makes it so much easier to use!</li>
            <li> Very efficient machine!</li>
            <li> It was my first epilator I ever used</li>
            <li> so nicely surprised about the light, and now my husband start to use it.....</li>
            <li> I love the no cord feature - after charging it is enough for legs/bikini areas for about 5-8 times (of course it depends on the hairiness).</li>
            <li> I love that in this one you can take the &amp;#34;head&amp;#34; off and actually wash it!</li>
            <li> My first night of use with this product did not go so well.</li>
            <li> Yes, the first time you use it, it hurts.</li>
            <li> I thought, hmm, when I tweeze, I grab the hair pretty close to the skin, not at the end... and maybe that&#x27;s what wasn&#x27;t happening with the epilator.</li>
            <li> (BTW, those lighted tweezers are pretty</li>
            <li> DO NOT expect that your legs, or whatever, will be completely hair free for up to 4 weeks.  </li>
            <li> decreases after the first epilation&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> It has many different uses.  </li>
            <li> It takes multiple passes to remove most of the hair in an area.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> I would definitely suggest waxing the area a couple times first to determine whether you&#x27;ll be able to handle the pain and get an idea of the frequency with which you&#x27;ll have to put yourself through that pain.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is the first epilator I&#x27;ve owned with all-plastic &amp;#34;tweezers&amp;#34;, all others were metal &amp;#34;tweezers&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> and this was my first one.</li>
            <li> This was the first time I used or purchased an epilator.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so maybe my pain tolerance is higher than others maybe not.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s so pretty.  </li>
            <li> I get 2 full sessions in each time before re-charging anyway, but if the orange light comes on while I&#x27;m in the middle of a leg</li>
            <li> I&#x60;ve used so many different epilators - \\&quot;Emjoi Emagine Tweezer - Head</li>
            <li> anyone who&#x27;s considering this Philips epilator should understand exactly what it is.</li>
            <li> I use light circular motions and direct the heads against the hair growth.</li>
            <li> This hurts, but it really works!</li>
            <li> I love all the extra attachments too.</li>
            <li> So I needed a more efficient method and recently got this epilator.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Overall, it&#x27;s a great buy, I hope it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> but I thought getting a more expensive one with more features would work even better.</li>
            <li> The first time you probably should plan to do it on a weekend with nothing else going on.</li>
            <li> My first one lasted me 10 years.</li>
            <li> Overall I am pleased with the product.</li>
            <li> It got hot -but not too hot-</li>
            <li> It also had that \\&quot;hot machine\\&quot;</li>
            <li> time I would follow my gut feeling and get the one I like or think will like and not entirely based on reviews :)</li>
            <li> one thing really annoys me: I can&#x27;t stand model regression in any product!</li>
            <li> The old model with a battery and a light would be a</li>
            <li> And if you keep it there more than necessary it will scratch your skin!</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t lie, I was sweating the first time I used it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had many different epilators before and this one just didn&#x27;t cut it.</li>
            <li> If you never used epilator before, try twiners first in each area where you think you will use an epilator, it will give you an idea.</li>
            <li> I have had too many to count and if they get infected, do not wait to seek a topical antibiotic.</li>
            <li> This is my first epilator...</li>
            <li> This is my first time using an epilator, and I read all the reviews before buying it...</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m a pretty hairy girl).</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t have any of the redness that I lot of people have described after epilating for the first time.</li>
            <li> The style attachment it comes with is great for delicate areas.</li>
            <li> My first epilator.</li>
            <li> This was the first epilator that I&#x27;ve used or purchased.</li>
            <li> Love the extra Shaver Head&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Sure we have to use an adaptor but that is simple.</li>
            <li> The first one I had that did.</li>
            <li> I had waxed under arms a week ago and had few hairs growing which came out without any pain surprisingly.</li>
            <li> have been waxing off and on for a few years and just didn&#x27;t want to shave again after a good 3 months of waxing.  </li>
            <li> Saves time, money and my legs look great longer with very little effort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Summer and shorts here we come!</li>
            <li> The only reason I know it is missing some hairs is because of the super bright light.  </li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s no worse than waxing, and the pain goes away quickly, the result is much smoother than shaving.</li>
            <li> you have many other options that are far better and cheaper).  </li>
            <li> After use the area is very irritated, I do not suggest using this right before you throw of a bikini.</li>
            <li> After my first time epilating, my legs have been mostly stubble-free (my leg hair are really fine, so a few strands were cut instead of pulled out).</li>
            <li> liked that the different heads give you tons of options to use the product, and come in a nice little bag too!</li>
            <li> simple design, value for money, easy diy at home method, no mess technique, pain completely bearable against the results, handy pouch to store, smart tweezers come along</li>
            <li> It will pulse for certain duration and the light will disappear for the rest of the time, until after the epilator is completely charged.</li>
            <li> My favorite part is the little LED light on them.</li>
            <li> love the little light in it</li>
            <li> Blinks brightly while charging, turns off when done (well actually turns solid and then turns off after a while, but unless you&#x27;re watching it like a hawk...</li>
            <li> I also find that there is more hair pickup than without the attachment, so I don&#x27;t have to run my epilator over the same area as much.</li>
            <li> It give me severe rash and white spots and in the top of that, my legs were really itchy wen</li>
            <li> and I imagine that would be more so in more delicate parts of the body.</li>
            <li> My old Philips epilator is by far better than this one.</li>
            <li> After 2-1/2 years of elipating, most of my hairs are either coming back as baby fine blonde hairs or not at all.</li>
            <li> With Phillips ceramic discs it only takes once or sometimes 2 times to go over the area and it removes all the hairs even the most fine and short once.</li>
            <li> If you are super sensitive to having your hairs tweezed, this is probably not for you!</li>
            <li> when you pop off the top to clean it you can see all the little hairs in the bottom.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fast and really removes your hair!</li>
            <li> As I said earlier, I did receive this product for free, but I would gladly pay to replace it if necessary.</li>
            <li> I will for sure be more careful next time!</li>
            <li> I loved it, it does hurt a bit, but I usually wax</li>
            <li> My life is much easier now thanks to my new Philips Epilator!!!</li>
            <li> It is great for legs tough, just because it is fast!</li>
            <li> However, the charger should work, but you must first hear a big CLICK sound when you plug the cord into your epilator.</li>
            <li> The device cleans really easy and is simple to take apart and put together.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> : my first epilation didn&#x27;t leave my legs silky smooth, but that might be from some hairs being way way too short.</li>
            <li> I did use it when I first started out and gradually became comfortable enough not using it.  </li>
            <li> Easy to store in provided bag, not too big</li>
            <li> It is pretty powerful and not meant for sensitive skin like that on the face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would strongly recommend using this product following the epilator.</li>
            <li> The battery doesnt last a full leg session for me, but I am rarely away from a plug in.</li>
            <li> would strongly recommend it to anyone who has a lot of sudden plans and can&#x27;t always manage to get to the parlor in time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this epilator for a little under 3 months and overall, I&#x27;m pretty happy.  </li>
            <li> It would have been smart to integrate a twist feature (like that of a water bottle) or a snap</li>
            <li> Certain alcohol-based deodorants may cause stinging and sometimes the technique can irritate the skin.</li>
            <li> I were smart</li>
            <li> and specially extra parts are very useful (she says) ;)</li>
            <li> When put side by side in the same area, the new model hurts definitely more.</li>
            <li> It charges fast and easily holds enough charge to do its job.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This has been in a box for about a week until I got brave enough to use it based on my past very brief excruciating experience with an epilady many years ago.  </li>
            <li> epilator comes with four different attachments for the fine to courser hair.</li>
            <li> The second one I received works and holds a charge fine.</li>
            <li> The second one works just fine.</li>
            <li> For the epilator, it works well, but I do have to take the guards off to reach the short fine hairs.  </li>
            <li> and the shaver seems pretty decent too.&lt;br /&gt;4)</li>
            <li> This epliator does a pretty decent job.</li>
            <li> OMG i have a very very high tolerance for pain</li>
            <li> /&gt;the epilator comes in its own little vanity bag where you can place the chargers, and its heads.</li>
            <li> Also, it really grabs the roots even the fine blonde hairs.</li>
            <li> I have a pretty high pain threshold</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s i little pricey, but you will get more than your moneys worth with this.  </li>
            <li> After a little bit of pain I would definitely recommend that you give the Philips Satin Perfect Epilator a try (only if you have some tolerance for pain).    </li>
            <li> It is best to epilate everyday for a few day so that the shorter hairs have time to grow out.</li>
            <li> This one seems to cause me the least amount of pain, but even more importantly, the fewest ingrown hairs.  </li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;-Hair doesn&#x27;t grow back as fast as shaving.&lt;br /&gt;-The tweezers with the light and mirror.</li>
            <li> this really works</li>
            <li> I was leery of doing to whole area in one go, so I did some.  </li>
            <li> The included shaver attachment works very well, so you could run the shaver over your legs after epilating if you need</li>
            <li> But get real</li>
            <li> I really, absolutely dislike the button.</li>
            <li> My dislike for the button does not really affect the epilator performance, but I think that feature could have been better thought out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> all, I like this product and will get much use from it.</li>
            <li> I would much rather just shave or wax.</li>
            <li> The pain on the legs is just too intense.</li>
            <li> part that she definitely likes is the razor attachment - it gives a nice, smooth shave without any trouble.</li>
            <li> Now let me say that I consider myself to be very tolerant of pain.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m very used to waxing, so the pain don&#x27;t bothers me at all.</li>
            <li> I was squinting my eyes in pain thinking \\&quot;really why torture yourself like this\\&quot;?</li>
            <li> I cannot stress enough how important exfoliating is.</li>
            <li> that was much shorter.  </li>
            <li> but really they do nothing to ease the epilator for me.  </li>
            <li> real gem here is the shaver though.  </li>
            <li> As much as it pulls hair out my understanding is that epilation lasts a lot longer like waxing.  </li>
            <li> It is indeed much smoother I can attest.  </li>
            <li> You can figure it out yourself very easily.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very understandable charging indicators.  </li>
            <li> but it seems like a real</li>
            <li> As much as I like the tweezer</li>
            <li> what I have done with it looks very nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but it seems like a real possibility.  </li>
            <li> As much as I like the tweezer</li>
            <li> - so really long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> cause it really didn&#x27;t hurt much at all.&lt;br</li>
            <li> After receiving this through Buzzagent.com, I was really exited to use this.</li>
            <li> What it does, it does well: removes hair from the folicle level very well.</li>
            <li> It works really well.</li>
            <li> Very</li>
            <li> you have waxed your entire life, this pain may not be that unbearable, but if you are primarily a shaving type of girl like me, boy does it hurt!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it has one head for shaving, for the time when the pain becomes too much and you just want to shave as well as messaging heads.</li>
            <li> I really like this.  </li>
            <li> very smooth.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Ingrown hairs are a real issue once you do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really like this epilator</li>
            <li> I a very hairy woman.</li>
            <li> Warning light when battery is getting low</li>
            <li> This epilator works really well.</li>
            <li> This epilator really doesn&#x27;t work well.</li>
            <li> 5 mins later i&#x27;m stubble free.</li>
            <li> The shaving attachment works really well</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone who hates shaving, and just wants a &amp;#34;one and done&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I really like this hair remover machine</li>
            <li> but it works very well.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really think it woud help as much as it does.  </li>
            <li> I used it very genteelly  as the instruction mentioned.</li>
            <li> long, it grabs just fine and is less apt to break the hair off.  </li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this epilator</li>
            <li> Better than I expected.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall the epilator is well made and seems to function very well.</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t tried the shaver head, I much prefer to use a blade razor.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t remove all hairs and even it hurts so much.</li>
            <li> its depends on how much you can take pain and how much you are used to it.</li>
            <li> also fast, painless, two speeds, tweezers are so often set up.</li>
            <li> With epilator the hair does not grow fast and in some places just stops growing altogether.</li>
            <li> It is kind of loud, I have to up the volume on tv quite a bit to hear it over epilator, but at least I can do it with something on (unlike old epilator).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Phillips makes fantastic products!</li>
            <li> This really amazed me.</li>
            <li> This way, you can pluck out the hairs on your whole face anywhere there is hair.&lt;br /&gt;She</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I really like this; given the chance for a do-over, I&#x27;d buy it again.</li>
            <li> It really is a help.  </li>
            <li> That is really misleading.  </li>
            <li> , even very slowly&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would much rather do this at home than have to go to a waxing salon every 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> Very efficient&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This item is very usefull.  </li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t plan on using that part very often.  </li>
            <li> and I need my epilator to be ready when I am.</li>
            <li> For this price, you should really get a nicer case.</li>
            <li> Still very costly and time-consuming, and still no long-term results.</li>
            <li> I spent many hours agonizing over every product and every review, and I couldn&#x27;t decide which one to try.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Still very costly and time-consuming, and still no long-term results.</li>
            <li> I spent many hours agonizing over every product and every review, and I couldn&#x27;t decide which one to try.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Never been smoother and it is so much easier to use there than underarms.</li>
            <li> I got the same results as i did from a cheap 25 dollar epilator.</li>
            <li> It works really well if you fall the instructions.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The light is genius, never thought I would need such thing</li>
            <li> That stuff REALLY works and you will see slower hair regrowth when used after epilation.&lt;br</li>
            <li> everything was smooth at the same time.</li>
            <li> how fast it works.</li>
            <li> haha).  </li>
            <li> I was very hesitant to buy, but read reviews and thought,</li>
            <li> It feels very plastic</li>
            <li> so much - ouch.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall though, I really like this product and would recommend it.</li>
            <li> But also hurts as the rotation movement is more rough.</li>
            <li> but let&#x27;s get real.</li>
            <li> However, since you are running the show, I found that pacing it according to your comfort levels is really helpful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But I don&#x27;t care much about it.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m very used to the sensation of the hairs being pulled out.  </li>
            <li> But like I mention before it&#x27;s so much faster removing all the hairs</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really looking forward to years of use from it.  </li>
            <li> but for what it&#x27;s designed to do, it does it very well.  </li>
            <li> Very nice-followed others advice on how to use it</li>
            <li> and it worked very well.</li>
            <li> or I&#x27;ve been a very unlucky customer.</li>
            <li> This Philips epilator does a very thorough job.  </li>
            <li> My legs actually felt smooth, which they never did when using the Panasonic one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was really looking forward to this working, but it doesn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> and it left a perfectly smooth patch on his arm</li>
            <li> Granted, I am 5&#x27;1\\&quot; but I don&#x27;t think that made much of a difference.</li>
            <li> It works very well to remove the hair without pain.</li>
            <li> the actual product, the epilator is nice middle ground weight.</li>
            <li> I thought that it would be great for someone who would use the epilator in the dark (for some strange reason...)</li>
            <li> This personal female groomer is a must have for those who like to keep things nice and neat.</li>
            <li> Wow, big difference - didn&#x27;t hurt any more, and it just breezed through.</li>
            <li> Touch ups are necessary, but not as traumatic as a full epilation the first time.  </li>
            <li> To be honest, after about 5 minutes it really is no big deal.&lt;br /&gt;The contraption comes with different heads, a brush, an instruction manual,  and  an electric shaver head.</li>
            <li> because wow, in some of the more sensitive areas, it&#x27;s far from it</li>
            <li> Since this pulls the hair out completely, my skin is left looking smooth (no razor burn!)</li>
            <li> Ok, I bought this epilator because my old one needs to be replaced and of course this one ha so many features; well, it&#x27;s not truth; first of all battery is enough for less then 5-10 minutes and when it&#x27;s charging it does not work.</li>
            <li> /&gt;People discuss how its better than the Emjoy Emagine, a product definitely geared toward facial use and no one mentioned that the instructions in this thing says right off, &amp;#34;FOR USE BELOW THE NECK.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I called Philips to ask if they had lost their minds because even the BOX says, &amp;#34;Total Body and FACE&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> This is one of the best purchases I have made this past year!!!!</li>
            <li> I have to say that the first touch is more or less hurtful but after couple of seconds, I get used to it.  </li>
            <li> I began to look for new ways on internet, and thanks to God!</li>
            <li> At first I thought this was ridiculous, but really wow it&#x27;s nice!  </li>
            <li> The ceramic tweezer head really does grip the hairs better than the metal counterparts found on other epilators.</li>
            <li> I normally use a reusable manual razor and have to shave every 2 days!</li>
            <li> cordless aspect is my other favorite thing about this epilator.  </li>
            <li> I use it other every week to make sure all the hair out .</li>
            <li> The shaving on the other model is much better and smoother</li>
            <li> /&gt;First epilation hurt (similar to waxing just significantly a slower pain)&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Ceramic aspect is functions better than other types.  </li>
            <li> I love it and recommend it to other friends.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It gives me freedom from having to set my routine as per parlor timings and be ready for any sudden special occasions as well.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> I usually use it the day before, and by the next morning things look great.</li>
            <li> The same is true of the epilator really...</li>
            <li> The same is true of the epilator really...</li>
            <li> It was okay, nothing more or less than expected.</li>
            <li> Overall it&#x27;s worth a try but don&#x27;t expect 100% results after the first use.</li>
            <li> That was really the main purpose of this purchase for me.</li>
            <li> But, of the ones I have tried this one does the absolute best job of getting hairs the first pass through, pulling them out completely - not breaking them and doing it with the least pain possible.  </li>
            <li> As long as the body doesn&#x27;t get wet on this one, it&#x27;s good</li>
            <li> However, the hairs it leaves are very fine and very short and not noticeable to the eye, but only to touch.  </li>
            <li> This surprised me very much because I do not have course hair.</li>
            <li> If you want a little more, like a Brazilian wax, like me, you&#x27;ll need a little bit more time and some training at first, but is very doable.</li>
            <li> but thank god amazon still took it back and send me a new one, free of charge.</li>
            <li> I had one that was a good 10 years old and was surprised that the new one worked much easier and much less pain.</li>
            <li> had my eye on The Sharp Image epilator, it is still new and has only a couple of reviews (good ratings)</li>
            <li> This is my favorite attachment out of the whole set because the pain from epilating is slightly diminished.</li>
            <li> speed - super fast - for areas with lots of hair such as legs&lt;br</li>
            <li> you&#x27;d  think it would last awhile,works good but just breaks on you so fast and for no good reason,am super pissed,wasted  200 bucks,</li>
            <li> It was by pure luck that I got it for the price I did because I had this one in my shopping cart, but I still want to review it because I have found my new</li>
            <li> I expected the pain that hit initially from the rapid plucking, but was extremely pleased with the results!</li>
            <li> It is comfy in your hands (even for a long period of time) and the light on the epilator is INVALUABLE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;</li>
            <li> I did not believe this, because with shaving it seems the opposite is true.  </li>
            <li> This was my first time purchasing an epilator, and I wasn&#x27;t completely settled on buying this one.</li>
            <li> I have been using my old cheap epilator for years now and was excited to find out how a more expensive one would compare.</li>
            <li> This will be short and sweet.  </li>
            <li> I put a washcloth in my mouth to bite down on just in case though :)</li>
            <li> Use for my face and it works better than any other hair removal I have tried!</li>
            <li> Generally speaking, the shaving attachment is convenient for someone who prefers shaving a certain area over epilating, and the trimming attachment is great to trim down any long hairs.</li>
            <li> I have had it for a bit now, and was kind of thinking maybe it is not working as well as when I first got it, but I actually think it is because the hair is coming back thinner when it does come back.  </li>
            <li> happy, depilating time takes twice less than other one, Im</li>
            <li> Sharon was really helpful and offered to send me a new epilator head at no charge.  </li>
            <li> My wife really likes her new epilator.</li>
            <li> but she really noticed a difference with this New Philips Epilator.</li>
            <li> I can say, my previous epilator with metal plates did its job much better.</li>
            <li> The head is wider so it grabs more hairs and gets the job done faster than any of three previous epilators I have owned.</li>
            <li> it cannot even compare to the HP 2844 versiion, which is more easier to use and cost me less time.</li>
            <li> about pain: I&#x27;ve waxed many times and this hurts about as much/a bit less but just takes longer.  </li>
            <li> It comes with a shaver/trimmer attachment head, but that is just a plus, not the main thing (do not get this gadget just for shaving -</li>
            <li> my legs were super red</li>
            <li> I have had enough time to feel it out and get a better sense of how everything works, and here is my final review.&lt;br</li>
            <li> There are two main heads - the epilator and a shaver.  </li>
            <li> Short of one that could be used in the shower like my boyfriend&#x27;s the shaver portion is pretty much exactly what I was thinking of looking for at some point.  </li>
            <li> Short of one that could be used in the shower like my boyfriend&#x27;s the shaver portion is pretty much exactly what I was thinking of looking for at some point.  </li>
            <li> It charges quickly and the charge lasts through several epilation cycles.  </li>
            <li> Iv used many Epilators before and this was was goid while it last d bit actually took off the finnest hairs.</li>
            <li> Wife loves it, replaced an older model she had had for years.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Satinelle for the last 20 years and the basic model that cost $29 works 10x better than this one.</li>
            <li> I spent a good hour or so finishing up some of the rough patches.</li>
            <li> Because it also has a shaver head, it can not only be used as such, but can also shave hair to a length which the epilator can most reliably remove.  </li>
            <li> Luckily, they do not detract from the overall usefulness of the epilator.</li>
            <li> I use this mainly on my underarms, just after the shower and before applying deodorant.</li>
            <li> My hair tends to grow back quickly.  </li>
            <li> The TWEEZERS are also great not only because of the LED light but also because of the little lipstick tube it comes in that also has a little mirror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you hold it at the right angle (not hard, very comfortable) and move slowly it works fantastically.  </li>
            <li> Be sure to follow them and when they say to hold the skin tight</li>
            <li> Be sure to follow them and when they say to hold the skin tight</li>
            <li> Although I feel that it takes approximately the same length of time to shave using a traditional razor as it does electrically, I would still recommend the Philips satin perfect epilator as a whole.</li>
            <li> I think it doesn&#x27;t have a high quality.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> The price is a bit high, but you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think of myself as having an unusually high pain tolerance, and I didn&#x27;t have any issue at all with using the epilator on my legs.  </li>
            <li> My sister-in-law has been using one since she was 16 and highly recommended it.</li>
            <li> HIGHLY RECOMMEND</li>
            <li> It hurts a lot so you should have a high tolerance for pain.  </li>
            <li> I have another one (a Panasonic) that I have used for a few years, but it took several passes over the same patch of skin to pull out most of the hair, and never would pull out all the hairs no matter how many times I went over the skin.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this Philips product.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> The epilator also has a built-in light that it really helps finding hairs you were not aware of.</li>
            <li> I really love this little machine.  </li>
            <li> Oh this little baby makes my life so much better.</li>
            <li> Wow!!</li>
            <li> Again, I love this little machine.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s better than I&#x27;ve expected!!!</li>
            <li> The skin stays smoother for longer too, with less ingrowns (use gentle loofah every day andyou&#x27;ll be fine - my waxing lady told me to do it</li>
            <li> Great Epilator, but not for the faint at heart (imagine that goes for any Epilator).  </li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t painful at all and did a marvelous job of removing hair.  </li>
            <li> I found it to be easier than expected and my legs felt smooth.  </li>
            <li> It is much quieter than my old model</li>
            <li> I really like my replicator so far.</li>
            <li> If you have a long enough eyebrow hair, sure, any tweezers will do.</li>
            <li> that normal hair removal is known for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It also works pretty good as a shaver, so if you are unable to tolerate the epilator feature you can still use it as an electric shaver.</li>
            <li> My leg hairs were only able 1-1.5mm long.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t use it for more than a few seconds at a time.  </li>
            <li> The key to success...</li>
            <li> Bought it a few years ago, and I still love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m now glad I misplaced it and had to buy another epilator.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found that I can really only use it for my legs, but it&#x27;s still worth it to me.</li>
            <li> While $100 may be overpriced I personally find that it was definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> I expect I&#x27;ll have to do touch-up every few days for a while, but even that is much better than slicing myself up shaving (</li>
            <li> I usually use the Braun epilator but have found that to get the best results I need to shave at least once in between epilations.  </li>
            <li> Although, I might look like a fool by putting this in my review but at least now it is an honest review.</li>
            <li> others have said, if you&#x27;re a first time user, have a professional waxing done first, of the areas you will use the epilator, then use this as soon as you start to see hairs grow back - maybe every week or two.  </li>
            <li> and so I only had a days worth of hair growth</li>
            <li> This shaver seems to catch more hair than my Emjoi, although I  have to shave several times in different directions as I did with my old shaver.  </li>
            <li> The shaver/ epilator work well for the most part, but does have a few flaws.  </li>
            <li> I do have to go in different directions for it to pull all of the hairs out, but it is still worth it.  </li>
            <li> I had high expectation for this new version, well it ends up with quite disappoitment.</li>
            <li> I have some very fine and light hair that can be difficult to see so</li>
            <li> after I did a little research, I was pretty excited to try it out.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s true that you have to be super careful of ingrown hairs I use a pumice stone, and tweezers to pull out and potential problems, but still have issues here or there.</li>
            <li> Love the ease of using it, except it doesn&#x27;t last very long, broke within 8 months.</li>
            <li> It can be used plugged in or not so you never have to stop half way and charge, the light really helps also.</li>
            <li> The light on the epilator made it easy to see any hairs I&#x27;d missed even in my poorly lit bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I normally buy the Braun ones but didn&#x27;t like that any of the new ones that you can use in the shower.</li>
            <li> It was already charged enough to work right out of the box</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t have any trouble figuring out the right amount of pressure (not very much, just enough to keep full contact with skin), and loved that I can do this dry.  </li>
            <li> This was priced great for all the functions it has, but it is a lot more painful than my Epilady, but besides that it gets the job done!</li>
            <li> Keep in mind this is a LONG process, it&#x27;s not like the quick zip of a razor.&lt;br /&gt;Day</li>
            <li> I feel like it just reflects off my skin, making it not so easy to see my dark</li>
            <li> I guess my hair isn&#x27;t long enough to grab there so not so effective, but there is a definite difference as compared to right armpit which I left alone to compare.  </li>
            <li> Nothing, but nothing, beats a sharp manual razor for a close, smooth shave, esp on a one-day growth of whiskers.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The added feature of a light on the shaver was extremely helpful because you could see what you missed.  </li>
            <li> a lot of research before this purchase as it was one of the more expensive, Im very pleased results, were just as expected.</li>
            <li> The light is extremely helpful, in fact, I would never buy an epilator without one.</li>
            <li> The deluxe version comes with the active hair lifter, active massaging system with pivoting cap, shaving head, trimming comb, and illuminating smart tweezers.</li>
            <li> I consider my pain tolerance to be pretty high, I&#x27;ve had multiple tatoos and did child birth without an epidural.</li>
            <li> Performance Cap - To be used if you are new to epilation.</li>
            <li> This alone makes me want to continue to use the epilator as my new means to shaving.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re new to epilation, I suggest trying them.  </li>
            <li> so I started looking for a new one.</li>
            <li> i live out of usa</li>
            <li> live</li>
            <li> I was reluctant to try this new way of shaving my legs.  </li>
            <li> Decided get  new one.</li>
            <li> one has all the bells and whistles you need if you&#x27;re new to epilating.</li>
            <li> Let me give you a helpful review for all new users like me who want to try it.&lt;br /&gt;1.</li>
            <li> So he ordered me a new product on May 29th.</li>
            <li> I checked online, but could not find anywhere to order the replacement part, so I started a chat with their customer service via the Philips.com website with the intent of ordering, and paying for, a new head.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had an Emjoi for years, but thought I would try something new.  </li>
            <li> Proper exfoliation and post treatment (I occasionally use PFB vanish) make a huge difference and help prevent ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li> I first used the epilator as it came, with just the normal head and such with no attachments.</li>
            <li> - This will only fit onto the above attachment (Shave, /trim and Style Attachment) and is used to trim your hair before epilation at a recommended length of about 1/8\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> It feels expensive...and very female oriented frankly with all the smooth lines, white and flowers.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I do really like the epilator, a day after its use, I&#x27;m ready to recommend with 5 stars, however, after about 10 days, I&#x27;m at a three star because its grown back in.  </li>
            <li> My first time it took several days for the skin to return to normal -</li>
            <li> Is very modern with different funcions</li>
            <li> I also have very sensitive skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Even after first use I can definitely see slower regrowth.  </li>
            <li> This is the first and only Epilator I have purchased and I have owned it for over a year.</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> I was not expecting it to be as loud as it was!</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s loud!</li>
            <li> So for the armpit I still use my old one!</li>
            <li> This is first epilator I have purchased and it will be the last as well.</li>
            <li> I will update this review as I continue to use this product but after the first use on various body parts:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not sure I&#x27;ll ever be able to use it on my legs though...</li>
            <li> Oh, it is loud!.  </li>
            <li> Use after a hot shower to open the pores and minimize irritation.  </li>
            <li> Yep, especially the first use.</li>
            <li> If you have ever tweezed your eyebrows, IT IS THE EXACT SAME FEELING!</li>
            <li> Wow!  </li>
            <li> Therefore I have to use it more often then usual.</li>
            <li> My favorite so far are the extra wide and</li>
            <li> The Philips is about twice the price I paid for my first epilator, but I feel its twice the quality, so I didnt mind paying the extra.</li>
            <li> hair that grows in different directs pretty well</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using epilators for the past 15 years and this is one of the better ones I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
            <li> So many are going to grab this for Christmas only to open the directions and have such a bummer of a let</li>
            <li> Only suggestion I might make is for the lighted tweezers to be a bit higher quality.</li>
            <li> The ceramic heads on the Philips are very simple looking and not scary at all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this epilator for about 6 months now, and if it broke tomorrow I would not hesitate to buy the exact same one again.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;I will not give this product review a higher score until I can actually use this product for longer than 1 month,</li>
            <li> Wow, what a difference!</li>
            <li> Wow, what a difference!  </li>
            <li> The first pass got almost all the hair, and the second got the rest.  </li>
            <li> Everything&#x27;s ok but the &amp;#34;Shave,trim and style&amp;#34; attachement is missing!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The light is bright, the battery lasts for longer than expected at full power, and the shape of the handle is comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;AS with all epilators, it&#x27;s not completely painless, but it is less painful than many I have previously used, even on more sensitive areas.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Quick and very efficient with a lot less &#x27;missed spots&#x27; and &#x27;pain&#x27;.</li>
            <li> it is actually faster and gentler than my previous epilator, no need to be nearby a plug as it is rechargeable, and the LIGHT makes things so much easier!  </li>
            <li> True, there is still a little sting (emphasis on little) but the results last a week or more!</li>
            <li> I would like to stop shaving due to dark underarms from razor burns in the past and this is the perfect product to help with that.</li>
            <li> Even then, I fully expected to return it fairly quickly.</li>
            <li> and I tried using it for upper lips and got full red patches and burnt sensation for 2days.</li>
            <li> I applied some No Scream Cream 45 minutes before doing my legs for the first time, though, and it hurt much less--after a while I was watching my TV show with only the occasional wince as I stripped my legs of hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;You will have slight stubble, but it won&#x27;t be very noticeable, as you&#x27;re not cutting the hair like shaving, but rather producing &amp;</li>
            <li> The epilator does not remove EVERY SINGLE HAIR, so if your objective is baby butt smooth legs, this product may not be for you.  </li>
            <li> When first turning on the epilator and going straight to the second speed setting, or switching over to the lower speed setting while the epilator is on, it is sometimes difficult to know whether you have successfully selected the setting (the sound difference between the two speeds is very minimal so this may be hard to determine success.)</li>
            <li> Well, first, you need to choose a less sensitive area for your first epilating experiences.  </li>
            <li> There are at least four different &amp;#34;heads&amp;#34; and I choose the one that massages skin when epilating, love it!</li>
            <li> But I turned it on and the light helps you see all of the little hairs you wouldn&#x27;t before.</li>
            <li> Even if I never use the tweezers on the go, atleast I&#x27;ll have the little light in case of emergency.</li>
            <li> I like the little light.</li>
            <li> I love the epilator mechanism (it is less painful than my last one), as well as the light the bonus heads are really nice as well.</li>
            <li> While it is a little loud, the sound isn&#x27;t unbearable.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> Inside the box was a cute little white zippered bag to keep all of the attachments that come with the epilator in one place!</li>
            <li> The light on the epilator is a life saver especially on my blonde hairs that can be much harder to see.&lt;br</li>
            <li> that years of evolution creates a product that is clearly a regression!&lt;br</li>
            <li> Mine was at least 10-15 years old, so I suspected (hoped) that a newer model would work better.  </li>
            <li> The issue was completely my fault, so I really appreciated them going the extra mile.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a guy, and not very hairy, but definitely prefer smooth.  </li>
            <li> Because the roots of my hair are pretty dark, shaving doesn&#x27;t really do the job for me</li>
            <li> So far, I like it,</li>
            <li> The see-through \\&quot;glass\\&quot; (it is actually plastic) effect on the front is also very attracting.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel like they really do anything extra.</li>
            <li> I use Lush&#x27;s Aqua Mirabilis Body Butter bar.</li>
            <li> I just don&#x27;t feel like the razor really gets close enough to do anything.</li>
            <li> I had an old one that just wasn&#x27;t working too well.  </li>
            <li> The pain is no big deal, goes by fast</li>
            <li> Some people had me so terrified with horror stories of the epilator that I regretted getting it at first, until I tried it for myself and saw the results that allowed me to go a long time without having to worry about my leg hair and having softer, finer, and blonder leg hair that grew in.</li>
            <li> Fast forward to a week later....    </li>
            <li> As far as the bikini area...</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin on my legs</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t even dissolve one hair, and it irritated my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I expected a bit better performance from it - when it goes out, I think I will get Braun again (switched after my old one stopped working to see which performs better), when this one fails.</li>
            <li> thought it was going to be like the old Epilady torture device of the 90&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> Let me say - WOW was I wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You can go to a professional, which I recommend if you&#x27;ve never had waxing experience, or you can do it yourself with the home kits.  </li>
            <li> When epilating (with any epilator) there is always the chance that a hair, instead of being pulled out completely, will break off at the surface of the skin or just underneath.  </li>
            <li> When the battery dies, it doesn&#x27;t do it gradually like my old one, it&#x27;ll just stop</li>
            <li> mine was getting really old</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t so much &#x27;pull hair&#x27; as it does &#x27;grab it and break it off just above the surface.&#x27;</li>
            <li> Unless I am in direct sunlight I could never get all my hair because I couldn&#x27;t see them&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so it takes some time to remove them completely</li>
            <li> I purshased this epilator as a replacement for my old one.</li>
            <li> It is comfortable to the grip and also not too heavy</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been 3 weeks though and my hair is already starting to come in so much thinner.</li>
            <li> This flimsy thing was like an old Timex...</li>
            <li> As a matter of fact I just bought another one because my 20year old burned.</li>
            <li> /&gt;As far as swelling, yes there will be some.</li>
            <li> It works fast and surprisingly quiet.</li>
            <li> and complete instructions&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li> It is also loud.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an got an extension for sensitive spots like under arms and bikini lines.</li>
            <li> it is loud.  </li>
            <li> I have two kids and a busy life (who doesn&#x27;t?)</li>
            <li> The epilator feature is what I have used so far.</li>
            <li> bought this as my old epilady was falling apart-  </li>
            <li> is nearly always).</li>
            <li> I started using an epilator since I was 10 years old.</li>
            <li> reason I have rated this product so low is it doesn&#x27;t really work.</li>
            <li> I am now using my old one still</li>
            <li> The rotating heads are not so soft as the old model.</li>
            <li> The old model is/was really soft and gentle.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li> old undies</li>
            <li> The device stopped immediately, but the head was completely tangled with elastic.  </li>
            <li> Needs frequent charging.</li>
            <li> I did feel it the first time because my hairs were really long.</li>
            <li> My old epilator had metal disks, this one has ceramic.  </li>
            <li> so maybe my skin is just sensitive in those areas.</li>
            <li> The Philips also has a closer shave than the old one.  </li>
            <li> noice is just as loud as my old epilator.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I used to get rush and bumps from my old Remington.</li>
            <li> Really dissapointed, it is going back.</li>
            <li> (I had an old Emjoi Soft Caress Epilator - 36 Gold Plated).</li>
            <li> and then I just rinsed all the parts off in the sink when I was completely done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My old epilator seemed to have lost its umph.  </li>
            <li> Well, I decided to go with this product again because I wanted to see if a more expensive one was really worth it.  </li>
            <li> If you stick through the first couple of painful sessions, then you will be rewarded with gorgeous smooth long lasting hairless legs!  </li>
            <li> my wife is Brazilian and she had one this maybe not the same but one that works just like this one, so any way she is in love with it, it does what is meat to do, without too much trouble, no need to read a manual, you can use while is charging.</li>
            <li> It is really good but not perfect.</li>
            <li> I love this product and I have thick corse hair</li>
            <li> Then I wait till I&#x27;m about ready to go to bed, and then I usually run a quick bath just to exfoliate.</li>
            <li> Twice, while epilating, my hand has slipped and my finger has jammed right into the spinning heads.</li>
            <li> For people that can use the tweezers however, the light pinpoints a specific area extremely well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve previously owned two emjois, the last one, the emagine, had a piece of that round plastic on the outside edge of the tweezers crack and snap off, just outside the 30-day warranty (cost $140) and emjoi &amp;#34;customer service&amp;#34; couldn&#x27;t repair or replace--they recommended I buy the next best model.</li>
            <li> Simply press the on/off button once to turn on the device (this is the high speed); press again (this is the slow speed); press one more time and it turns the device off.    </li>
            <li> The light really helps to see the small hairs, and I only needed a couple of passes to get all the hairs.  </li>
            <li> After letting the epilator charge for a little while (it charges pretty fast), I decided to give it a go on my leg.</li>
            <li> What would be useful would be to know how to compares to other epilator options.  </li>
            <li> What would be useful would be to know how to compares to other epilator options.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been epilating for a while, so I went right for the direct hit without using any of the other accessories and again, would call it almost painless.  </li>
            <li> so I could only shave maybe once or twice a week, and my hair grows back very fast.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the active hair lifter attachment, especially on my legs - as the hairs tend to lay flat.</li>
            <li> I had a Epilady prior to this one and thought I would try a new brand!</li>
            <li> Having only used this one, all I can say is this one is super nice in every way except that it hurts like crazy.</li>
            <li> My mom had an Epilady, which was less like an actual hair remover, and more like a medieval torture device.  </li>
            <li> Shave first and then start epilating on a daily basis two days later.</li>
            <li> I had an older version of satin epilator, but after several years it stop working.</li>
            <li> But this one only seems to work if hairs are a particular texture/length, and either ignores or breaks the others.</li>
            <li> effect (for a few weeks at least) :o)</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;You have to wait awhile for the hairs to grow long enough (not as fun in summer</li>
            <li> I have appreciated the reviewers who have separated their experiences with epilating in general from their experiences of using a specific expilator.</li>
            <li> job (the most important!) - 1 star :(</li>
            <li> I have been epilating for years and recently purchased this to replace an older emjoi model.  </li>
            <li> on how to attach certain attachments were not clear.</li>
            <li> This scared me a little more seeing how fast those little tweezers were moving.</li>
            <li> I use the high speed setting, and it doesn&#x27;t appear to be quite as wakening so to say as the low speed.  </li>
            <li> I managed to do all of this in less than 30 minutes on one charge and the low battery light</li>
            <li> I used the epilator on my legs and it really doesn&#x27;t work unless your hairs are a somewhat long.</li>
            <li> It WORKS!!!, small hair, not a problem, picks up everything, leaves skin smooth for over 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that is seems to &amp;#34;break&amp;#34; a lot of hairs instead removing it completely, so I have to use it more often than I would like to for touch-ups throughout the week.</li>
            <li> The battery lasts long and doesn&#x27;t take much time to charge.</li>
            <li> Last but not least, there is the shaving/trimming attachment.</li>
            <li> think if you&#x27;re used to waxing and have success with that, and your hair doesn&#x27;t grow in a crazy mess, you&#x27;ll enjoy the easy and cost effectiveness of this product.</li>
            <li> Also the epilator only catches hairs of a certain length, so if you use just an epilator you will constantly have stubble.</li>
            <li> The epilator can only grab a hair of a certain length, leaving those that are too short.</li>
            <li> too large for facial, particularly upper lip, use.</li>
            <li> After first use your legs will look like little raised blotches of skin (where the hair was pulled out), but if you epilate at night before bed and immediately after epilating used a cool washrag to rub down your legs and then moisturize the swelling will be completely gone by morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This epilator will leave behind the very fine and shorter hairs, you know they are there to the touch, but not at all visible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am in total shock that my legs are still smooth (besides the little hairs the epilator missed and the hairs</li>
            <li> The accessories are fragile and the little bag that came with is really cheap.</li>
            <li> Only because I wanted a brand spanking new one did I buy this epilator.</li>
            <li> It is definitely noisier than my old Braun one, but the pro&#x27;s far outweigh that one con.</li>
            <li> The end results are essentially the same, except the razor will give much smoother results</li>
            <li> The only real inconvenience I guess is the fact that it cant be used in the shower and the head comes off a bit occasionally</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much cheaper than regular waxing and provides a similar result.</li>
            <li> It truly helps me see &amp; quickly pick up on the few stray hairs that get</li>
            <li> I go quite slowly, about 30 minutes for both legs (could easily do in 20)</li>
            <li> I thought the light would be annoying, but it&#x27;s actually really nice because it helps you see any hairs you might have missed.</li>
            <li> However after first epilation (the most painful time) I really like using Philips Hp6576.</li>
            <li> Now I have dark hair, so I can see a lot without the light, but I can only imagine if I had blonde hair, this would be a Godsend.  </li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this product to anyone who would be willing to put in the extra 5 minutes to epilate and in return receive longer lasting hairless legs.</li>

            <li> not other seller.&lt;br /&gt;im</li>
            <li> I actually think this one works best at cutting down the pain.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> The fine little hairs don&#x27;t get caught and have to be quite long.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t find the extra attachments useful, however compared to other epilator products and prices,</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, that aside, I do like the product overall and even if the epilator function isn&#x27;t a first choice over the old Shick Pro Glide, a lot of the other features are nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A little pricey but worth</li>
            <li> It does not look like it looks in the photos, it is less shiny and less elegant (but it&#x27;s not a fashion</li>
            <li> I wish I had been more serious about hair removal earlier in life.  </li>
            <li> I still managed to use it with gritted teeth very slowly, but it wasn&#x27;t enjoyable -</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d have it permanently removed, but apparently that&#x27;s hard for light hair.</li>
            <li> This works great to remove hair, but is PAINFUL.  </li>
            <li> I might keep it in my purse for general use</li>
            <li> /&gt;And now for my story on epilating in general . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t shave.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if that is a product-specific problem, or a general epilator problem.</li>
            <li> Overall, each attachment offers an improved epilating experience.</li>
            <li> Not to mention it barely fits all of the items.</li>
            <li> Trim and Style Attachment - This is used to shave sensitive areas such as your underarms and bikini area and legs.  </li>
            <li> I have yet to manage to completely sit through an entire leg session, but we&#x27;ll see...</li>
            <li> I have yet to manage to completely sit through an entire leg session, but we&#x27;ll see...</li>
            <li> I used it for shaving my upper legs and armpits--even though I&#x27;ve epilated for years, those areas are too sensitive for me to epilate.  </li>
            <li> but if you are sensitive to pain or just starting out try using covered ice packs or frozen wash cloths until you get used to things.  </li>
            <li> Once you get past the first (really ouch) time (wine helps a lot), if you use it regularly (I&#x27;m of the... um... hirsute variety</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe this listing says specifically, &amp;#34;&amp;#34;Ergonomic design for both sensitive face and body areas&amp;#34; and the item&#x27;s instructions say quite the opposite and its no typo.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The rest in the bow is complete, i wonder how can this be possible!?</li>
            <li> may be hairier than the normal gal (Eastern European genes) but it only lasts about 2 weeks (not 4 weeks)&lt;br /&gt;Epilating the arm pits hurt like and hasn&#x27;t gotten better&lt;</li>
            <li> Is the pain worth not shaving for a few weeks?</li>
            <li> but she found that the epilator function doesn&#x27;t give her a good shave on her legs (at least for the small part that she could stand to use it on).</li>
            <li> But honestly, even when the hair does grow back, it grows back thin.</li>
            <li> Too many unnecessary accessories</li>
            <li> &quot;, I didn&#x27;t find it useful, as the head is horizontally wide so it did not feel as if it covered more area, also it made it difficult to epilate in curves areas (underarms, ankle area, and bikini line).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> /&gt;First to test, I did the little tiny hairs on my knuckles, zero pain, quickly gone.  </li>
            <li> I have very fine thin blonde hair, and it seems to struggle to catch them all.</li>
            <li> The first time I sat down to use it I was so nervous.</li>
            <li> The first time I sat down to use it I was so nervous.</li>
            <li> She found that it worked better on her feet where there is less hair (and the hair is less coarse).</li>
            <li> Although with a larger head, it fails to remove a lot of hairs and when that happens it hurts more!</li>
            <li> If I were new to epilators, I&#x27;d have thrown the whole mess in a box and sent it back.  </li>
            <li> My hair type is soft, and fine, yet annoys me (since I have visible amounts that I&#x27;m not happy with as a female).&lt;br</li>
            <li> After 10 minutes of use the shaver did not loose any power.  </li>
            <li> Shaved my legs one time every other week to show my legs one day because of the fast grow of my hair.</li>
            <li> but I think all the little extras make it worth the extra money</li>
            <li> Way better than having to shave everyday to every other day!!</li>
            <li> Waited until May 29th (2 weeks) to call back (since I still had not received my charger) to tell them my story again and this person said that the previous person did not help me enough, and that I should have been ordered a whole new product, under warranty.</li>
            <li> For something that seems like it should be so simple, the instruction sheet is huge and confusing.  </li>
            <li> For something that seems like it should be so simple, the instruction sheet is huge and confusing.  </li>
            <li> MUCH easier than shaving, can do it on the couch while bored watching tv, and it leaves your skin smooth.</li>
            <li> The active massaging system with pivoting cap attachment also works really well.</li>
            <li> After the second or third time epilating, my legs were completely stubble-free.</li>
            <li> Loud enough to bother my french bulldogs who must have thought I was being attacked because they both came to my rescue.&lt;br</li>
            <li> ; it really was minimal, especially considering what you&#x27;re doing (removing hair at the roots).  </li>
            <li> don&#x27;t really work to well and can actually make it a bit harder to get to some areas.  </li>
            <li> I did one last shave, and right about when I started seeing little stubby hairs again</li>
            <li> An hour and a half later my legs are a little sensitive and tingly but my arms and hands feel fine</li>
            <li> It is a little intimidating at first to hear the shaver on and see the shaver wheel grind.  </li>
            <li> Yes, it hurts little bit at first.</li>
            <li> I managed to do my full legs in about an hour from big toe to 1&amp;#34; away from my bikini line with only a few winces on my inner thighs, I think.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it hurts much less if you use it on the second or third day of your period, or right after it.</li>
            <li> - come back here to find a product that&#x27;s right for you; the pain becomes bearable after the hairs have been pulled out of their follicles a few times.  </li>
            <li> So I will begin with the review of this specific product, and if you want to know my experience with epilating in general, you can keep reading.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I did get red spots on my legs where the hair was pulled, but the spots were completely gone by the next day and they only seem to appear now when the hair is longer or denser (i.e. going longer between epliating sessions).  </li>
            <li> So far it seems to hold a charge for a long time, about 45 minutes.  </li>
            <li> My take on this is: first time use will hurt, but try to use it after you have had wax/shaved and have few hairs showed up.</li>
            <li> While it is not exactly comfortable at first by the time i finished one leg</li>
            <li> My hairs are thick and darks even before my first shave there were really dark, that all the students in the school make fun of me.</li>
            <li> Also, the skin under my arms doesn&#x27;t seem to get totally dry no matter how much I dry it, so maybe that&#x27;s why it isn&#x27;t picking up as much, too.  </li>
            <li> The epilator may not have as much life as one that has a \\&quot;switch\\&quot; type of button (where you go up or down depending on the preferred speed.)</li>
            <li> It took about 10 minutes to do both legs from the knee down, so I would guess that 20 minutes for both whole legs is about right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If, like me, you sometimes get super lazy in the winter and ignore your legs for months, there is always the option of starting over with the initial waxing</li>
            <li> In addition it is very sharp and fast.</li>
            <li> Much faster than the previous model I owned.</li>
            <li> But so far they are doing the job well, and only time will tell how long the plastic tweezers will hold up.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The cute packaging of this $150 razor appealed to my 15-yr-old daughter, who had no better luck than I did with the epilator (ouch, and no smooth shave; pain but no gain).</li>
            <li> I will say that it DOES GET EASIER after the first few times over the same area.</li>
            <li> For someone that may have sensitive skin to begin with and needs the lower setting every single time, this would be a hassle.</li>
            <li> The charge on the Braun does not last long enough to complete the job and it cannot be used while charging.</li>
            <li> Also the cordless feature only lasts around 40 mins, which isn&#x27;t really long enough to complete both legs.</li>
            <li> my hair grows back very slowly and fine.  </li>
            <li> It has not dulled down a bit, which is a relief after discovering how quickly the shaving attachment dulled down.</li>
            <li> It has not dulled down a bit, which is a relief after discovering how quickly the shaving attachment dulled down.</li>
            <li> I was very intrigued by epilators about a year back and was so intrigued that I purchased a Braun one with little metal disks rather than the ceramic ones like this product contains.</li>
            <li> I will list all the points good &amp; bad</li>
            <li> While it may not seem like much for some (or a lot for others), I think you should base whether or not you should buy this product based on your own tolerance level with pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not to mention the fact that I have very thick, dark hair that grows super fast, so even after enduring the pain of shaving, I would have stubble within 24 hours.</li>
            <li> It takes a few weeks to get all the hair removed due to difference in hair growth time, but still worth it.</li>
            <li> Suck it up the first few tries through the irritation - it won&#x27;t make you break out like veet and future sessions with it</li>
            <li> I have already  recommended to everyone my hair hardly grows back since using it for the first month  </li>
            <li> Easy pictoral guide (I read just the essential and skipped most of the boring word-to-word directions)&lt;br /&gt;9/10</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t do my legs because I shaved recently and the hair isn&#x27;t long enough yet.  </li>
            <li> I only gave it 4 stars because I haven&#x27;t had it long enough to give it 5.</li>
            <li> I tried waiting several days thinking all the hair should be long enough but that was never the case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I tested it on my arm first and could hardly steel myself to use it again.</li>
            <li> you get used to the pain super quickly, though the first run is the worst.</li>
            <li> i had the old one for over a year and the motor burned out and i was forced to buy a new one.  </li>
            <li> Felt this product was average as far as epilators go.  </li>
            <li> The results are long lasting.</li>
            <li> but perhaps they weren&#x27;t long enough.</li>
            <li> I also don&#x27;t every see myself having long enough hair to ever use the trimmer attachment.  </li>
            <li> This cap should be used if your hair lies flat on your skin.</li>
            <li> You can use it with a cord or without and it holds a charge long enough to throughly finish both legs.</li>
            <li> The charge itself lasts a long time - I&#x27;ve used it for multiple sessions before having to recharge.</li>
            <li> I thought about it for a long time and finally figured I would just try to find a way to deal with the pain somehow.</li>
            <li> I thought about it for a long time and finally figured I would just try to find a way to deal with the pain somehow.</li>
            <li> and I got this to remove hair on the back of my calves that tickles when I wear long pants (which in my neck of the woods</li>
            <li> The last note is on the big or \\&quot;extra wide head\\</li>
            <li> Hopefully it will last long.</li>
            <li> I hope this one lasts as long as the last one.</li>
            <li> - Takes approximately 1 hour to full charge and can be used for cordless operation for about 40 minutes.   </li>
            <li> As one reviewer said, you get what you pay for and for the price, I am very very satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 2/2/13: Used it on my arms, chest, stomach and down a little lower.  </li>
            <li> This one does pull the hairs with one particular head, but there are other attachments that will shave it like other shavers.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The cord is long enough to reach from the outlet by the sink to the toilet, which I sit on while doing my legs.</li>
            <li> Strangely, I think it exfoliates / removes small &amp;#34;dry type&amp;#34; of clogged pores too, as I&#x27;ve seen evidence of micro pores ready to pop with just a bit of dried congestion, magically &amp;#34;sluff&amp;#34; off with this device, and a collection of dried / dead skin cell debris on the device itself.  </li>
            <li> I made the mistake of being too gentle and didn&#x27;t push it in hard enough.</li>
            <li> I stared at them for quite a while until I finally tossed them aside and decided to figure it out myself, which really wasn&#x27;t that hard.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not a major problem though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I mean, really!</li>
            <li> There is a very very minor burning sensation afterwards, but it only lasts like 2 minutes.</li>
            <li> Honestly, a regular razor is faster even if you can&#x27;t (or shouldn&#x27;t) use it dry.  </li>
            <li> I did one half of one leg before I nearly passed out.</li>
            <li> so your hand won&#x27;t get tired quickly.  </li>
            <li> You really need it to be able to see where the hairs are, especially behind the knees and such.&lt;br</li>
            <li> So if you are able to tolerate a little pain and hate having to shave every other day, I would strongly recommend that you try out this epilator.</li>
            <li> Also for new users of epilators like me the razor allows you to trim your leg hair shorter beforehand so that the epilation process hurts a lot less!  </li>
            <li> If it would have lasted for at least a year i would have written a positive review.</li>
            <li> Again, not a deal breaker; I just pass a dry napkin or vacuum over the surface.&lt;br</li>
            <li> ; I just pass a dry napkin or vacuum over the surface.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I tried waxing, and it was a complete mess, and it didn&#x27;t attach to all of the hairs.</li>
            <li> The curved head makes it hard to use this on areas of the body that are not shaped that way for example arms or certain parts of my legs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> It also cuts the hair in half instead of ripping it out, which leaves a blunt ends and stubble, I can do that with shaving for a whole lot less.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a little bit of pain when you first start, but you get used to it after a few sessions.</li>
            <li> For those of you who don&#x27;t know, an epilator, in basic terms is an electrical device (looks like an electric shaver) used to remove hair by grasping multiple hairs simultaneously (think a bunch of tiny little tweezers) and pulling them out by the root.    </li>
            <li> /&gt;I would use caution though, as I have caused several lacerations when forcing the blades close to the skin, to grab &amp;#34;just a couple more tiny hairs.&amp;#34;  A bad bleed too.</li>
            <li> You need to do this at least a couple of times a week in the shower so that you don&#x27;t get ingrown hairs, which really are a pain.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m female, age 49, and partial to razor blades,</li>
            <li> It does not take long at all for the epilator to charge.</li>
            <li> This baby will not be going anywhere, and I hope it lasts a really long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A few hours after using it, you legs will be VERY red and have all these unflattering, tiny red bumps all over them.</li>
            <li> My hair is not really all over anymore, but there&#x27;s enough that I have to do something about it.  </li>
            <li> It took me a LONG time to do my legs, but once you get used to doing it, it should take 20 minutes and its done every 3-4 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li> I just have to see with time how long it lasts ...</li>
            <li> and it lasts for a long time before it needs</li>
            <li> Only difference is that here you are anticipating the pinch which makes it harder.</li>
            <li> spent the next couple of years trying to just be hairy.</li>
            <li> But it is easier than shaving and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t know how long it must be to work.</li>
            <li> I do not experience any pain, but I believe that is because I waxed for so long.  </li>
            <li> I find that it takes a long time</li>
            <li> The problem lies when you come to using the epilator to remove partial grow back.</li>
            <li> What I am not wild about is the noise.  </li>
            <li> This is what I expected from Phillips, a long lasting, dependable</li>
            <li> This is what I expected from Phillips, a long lasting, dependable</li>
            <li> product is essentially a bunch of tiny tweezers that when pressed down on your skin will grab at one of your hairs and pull the root out.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It takes 20-30 minutes to do my legs and underarms, the results last several days, and I can sit down and do it again any time without having to wait for weeks.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It takes 20-30 minutes to do my legs and underarms, the results last several days, and I can sit down and do it again any time without having to wait for weeks.</li>
            <li> My previous model had come with a freezer glove so you could kind of numb the area before you epilated.  </li>
            <li> but it also has smaller holes and less overall surface area.  </li>
            <li> Darn those big black hairs on the chin and upper lip!!!!!</li>
            <li> I have had several people look.&lt;br /&gt;The 2nd time around, the stubble is less noticeable.</li>
            <li> The regrowth is less, likely from the hairs it actually pulls out.</li>
            <li> Very unsatifised because the battery life is extremely limited and does not effectively remove hairs.</li>
            <li> You can use it anywhere (as long as it&#x27;s dry; this is not for in-shower use) and you are not tied to a power outlet.  </li>
            <li> The only real issue I&#x27;ve had is that some of the hair follicles on my arms got a pretty bad infection, I&#x27;m assuming due to the hairs not being removed properly.</li>
            <li> The other areas feel totally normal.&lt;br</li>
            <li> read in other reviews that after epilating, the hair grows back slower and finer.  </li>
            <li> the quiet snick of a sharp blade beats any gadget I&#x27;ve ever seen.</li>
            <li> it never seemed to present any danger other than yanking out hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it never seemed to present any danger other than yanking out hair.      </li>
            <li> Hellloooo Philips....soooo long emjoi!</li>
            <li> This is not meant for faces, but I&#x27;ve been using it once a month for my lower cheeks and upper neck - very carefully as it can pinch skin if you press around corners.</li>
            <li> The benefit of electrical shaving is the option to dry shave.</li>
            <li> I thought it would hurt like crazy but outside of a bit of a sting, it is fantastic.  </li>
            <li> is freakishly dry unless I use a post-epilation lotion/cream&lt;br /&gt;Despite</li>
            <li> And the more you get used to it, the lesser painful</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, this is an expensive personal grooming device, but it is well worth it.  </li>
            <li> Not shaving everyday is really appealing for just shy of a hundred dollars.  </li>
            <li> to avoid infected pores (you may have a few red pores the next day).</li>
            <li> Because I have used these for so long, I do not have a problem with discomfort and other ones have left red, slightly irritated skin</li>
            <li> For legs it takes little more time as I have very thin hairs.  </li>
            <li> It is a single push button, so you basically click the button for every function - turning it on/off and switching the power settings.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m so  obviously single..</li>
            <li> Especially when the hair is dark and wiry hair like mine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> When I first used this product I did not use it after showering and it hurt a lot worse.  </li>
            <li> ( I normally epilate but have been shaving for the past few months after my last epilator stopped wrokig, was a Braun).&lt;br</li>

            <li> However, after my second time using the shaving attachment, I realized that the blade has dulled down a bit.</li>
            <li> I must say, after the initial swelling goes down (see my tips about swelling below)</li>
            <li> You will get used to the pain, which is not that much compared to other epilators I have tried in the past!</li>
            <li> This second bath is only in like a few inches of water and takes only a few minutes.</li>
            <li> Ironically enough however, I found that longer hair (1/4 of an inch to 1/2 in) on the bikini area and a few other areas hurt a whole lot less than hair on my legs shaved a few days ago</li>
            <li> Given the previous reviews, let me start with DO NOT get this product if:  - you never waxed/epilated before and/or  - your pain threshold is low.   </li>
            <li> But when they were being pulled out, they were about 1/4in long, so I could tell that they were really being pulled out from the root instead of being broken off.</li>
            <li> I like to think that eventually less of my hair will grow in the future.</li>
            <li> I have been without my product for a month and a half, and I only used it for 1 month.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> this one actually hurts less than others.  </li>
            <li> Also, less hair grows back than before.</li>
            <li> With one device you can shave and epilate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some other things about this epilator--&lt;br /&gt;- The device stays charged for a long time.</li>
            <li> For anyone who doesn&#x27;t like shaving or the mess of waxing, I would totally recommend this.</li>
            <li> Not it doesn&#x27;t grow back in as thick, however if I shave that means I have to wait even longer to epilate as I wait for the hair to grow long enough.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the battery doesn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li> They come in a little tube (similar to lipstick)</li>
            <li> It did hurt a little on my upper lip but even waxing hurts a lot there for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I will say that it did leave a little bit of stubble on my legs, but it wasn&#x27;t a big deal to me.  </li>
            <li> Which means with its second use this little gem has paid for itself!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> little battery sign blinks when u are running low</li>
            <li> so you can actually know a little bit in advance.</li>
            <li> Value for money: May seem a little steep initially but its a one time investment.</li>
            <li> The next day, those hairs grow a little longer, you use the epilator and so on.</li>
            <li> Have never run out of charge but do need to push adapter into unit with a little extra umph.</li>
            <li> Trim your hairs with the little trimmer it comes with then use the actual epilator.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t painless, but using it is much less uncomfortable than epilating with the original EpiLady.</li>
            <li> It hardly pulls the hair and you have to go over the same spot multiple times and it still won&#x27;t get all the hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used both the active hair lifter and active massaging system attachments in place of the original one and I am not impressed with either.</li>
            <li> Up to you...if you get used to it, I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s not so bad, but</li>
            <li> Up to you...if you get used to it, I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s not so bad, but</li>
            <li> Power through and sum up your bravery because the noise makes sounds like it will be more painful than it is.  </li>
            <li> But this was more painful than wax.</li>
            <li> More painful were the itch, and the people comments.</li>
            <li> Okay, So Yes, this is painful and there is no way around that.</li>
            <li> Bikini area will always be painful, but it does get better.</li>
            <li> It does sting a bit, but frankly, lasering and waxing are a lot more painful.  </li>
            <li> I found that Speed 1 was more painful than Speed 2...</li>
            <li> I would think that it is not any more painful than waxing (</li>
            <li> The drier your skin is the more painful epilating is.</li>
            <li> This is much more painful then waxing.</li>
            <li> I have had a different epilator for at least 10 years by the same company and it still works!</li>
            <li> Washed and dried it, did under my left armpit.  </li>
            <li> It has been a few hours since I did the underarm, it feels tender, but the same sort of feeling as after waxing.  </li>
            <li> At the minimal the pouch could have had separate pockets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So be careful with the epilator functionality with this</li>
            <li> One of the attachments broke after one use, so be careful with them.</li>
            <li> Not to use in the water, but in an empty bathtub it&#x27;s perfect.&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li> Simply scrub your legs with a loofah or brush to get the dead skin out of the way and apply lotion liberally.  </li>
            <li> rough around the knees/top of feet areas</li>
            <li> louder than expected</li>
            <li> minimal discomfort.</li>
            <li> I expected to come home from the salon with baby-smooth skin that would stay hair-free for weeks.</li>
            <li> I expected to come home from the salon with baby-smooth skin that would stay hair-free for weeks.</li>
            <li> I have used the epilator a few times in different areas.</li>
            <li> and it is a bit slower than I expected.</li>
            <li> Minimal ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li> a pity</li>
            <li> epilation skin irritation is minimal in comparison.  </li>
            <li> So it is back from the dead, kicking and pulling hair as it is supposed to do.</li>
            <li> It does not really hurt at all.</li>
            <li> Works but be careful not to scrape your skin.</li>
            <li> but, that&#x27;s to be expected.</li>
            <li> If it&#x27;s buggin me that day I might drag a razor over to catch these few next shower, but if I don&#x27;t bother nobody knows but me.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Because the head is fairly wide, it can take a few passes at some different angles to get all the underarm hairs out.</li>
            <li> It left it really smooth, it is somewhat painful but nothing too extreme.</li>
            <li> how all these epilators are, but red lights come up from it 5min after starting using it and the battery runs out really fast,it´s so frustrating!!</li>
            <li> alittle painful on the legs more then other areas..</li>
            <li> Because of the placement of the OptiLight, a tight grip is required to clamp down on individual hairs.</li>
            <li> It is a bit painful the first couple times you use it, but after that it&#x27;s completely tolerable.</li>
            <li> I think I will never go back to waxing again after receiving this little gem!</li>
            <li> I did both legs up until little above knee in less than an hour.</li>
            <li> I had little red spots for about half an hour after I was done.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed with this epilator, because actually it doesn&#x27;t pull out the hair, but mostly splits the hair in the middle.</li>
            <li> Our other daughter will study in Spain all year, so</li>
            <li> I also feel that the tweezers&#x27; shape or cut does not work as well as my other tweezers.</li>
            <li> From other reviews I was expecting this process to be agonizing</li>
            <li> I like the other heads for it.</li>
            <li> The superiority of this model versus the other cheaper models is that you can attach the epilator head or the electric razor head.  </li>
            <li> So I decided to wait a bit before proceeding onto my other leg.</li>
            <li> There is a little pocket that disconnects from the shaving attachment that is supposed to catch the hair, but 2/3 of the hair always ends up outside of this little pocket.</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> Also if you have hair that grows in multiple directions like I do, going in small circles seems to help.&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li> In other areas I pulled through.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Other than the obnoxious instruction sheet (discussed in Cons)</li>
            <li> /&gt;Bottom line: if you want it as an epilator you need to read other reviews that compare it to other epilators.  </li>
            <li> if you want it as an epilator you need to read other reviews that compare it to other epilators.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been epilating my legs for approximately 10 years now, and have used various cheap and expensive epilators.  </li>
            <li> After you get used to epilation there, you can move on to other areas if you wish.  </li>
            <li> That goes for this epilator or any other epilator.&lt;br</li>
            <li> One is intended to massage/stretch the skin to make epilation easier; the other is intended to pull hairs up to make it easier for the epilator to catch them and pull them out.  </li>
            <li> The other attachments...</li>
            <li> I tried them and they seemed pretty useless.</li>
            <li> I also think it is way quieter than my other one.  </li>
            <li> have not tried in other areas.</li>
            <li> I havent tried any of the other attachments yet.</li>
            <li> and though it&#x27;s pricer than other epilators I always fully believe that you get what you PAY for.  </li>
            <li> and though it&#x27;s pricer than other epilators I always fully believe that you get what you PAY for.  </li>
            <li> It is not as noisy as other models.  </li>
            <li> other caveat that holds for all epilators, not just this one.  </li>
            <li> The curve also helps on the legs, knees and other curvy spots.</li>
            <li> I have extremely course underarm hair, and it grows inconsistantly.</li>
            <li> If this kit included an attachment cap that exposed only a small portion of the epilator head, it would be easier to use for underarms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> other thing -</li>
            <li> I read reviews of people who ripped up their skin with other epilators that have metal heads.</li>
            <li> Other suggestions I would make is lotion lotion lotion Before you epilate.</li>
            <li> so no complaints there although I am not sure I can use this for my entire bikini area.</li>
            <li> However, this doesn&#x27;t grip the hairs as efficiently as my other epilator.</li>
            <li> Whether you use this or other epilators, skin redness will be a temporary issue after treatment until the follicles get used to letting go of the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Money well spent!</li>
            <li> It is also EXTREMELY noisey, so no way to be discrete about hair removal.  </li>
            <li> Now (after three months of use) I may have a few little bumps the next day, but it&#x27;s not noticeable.</li>
            <li> It really helps to see all the little thin hairs.</li>
            <li> but..I could&#x27;ve spent a lot less money if I wanted one that was plug in.</li>
            <li> However, I wish that the massagers were also \\&quot;active\\&quot; as well, like the massager on the active hair lifter attachment.</li>
            <li> 3.Active Hair Lifter with Active Massage -</li>
            <li> I quickly left them all behind and just use the regular one</li>
            <li> It removes hair painfully just like other cheap epilators do.</li>
            <li> Very difficult to clean.</li>
            <li> I have never had a pair of tweezers that weren&#x27;t just two little metal sticks hooked together in the center.</li>
            <li> It was far less painful, though still painful, and far better for my skin.</li>
            <li> It was far less painful, though still painful, and far better for my skin.</li>
            <li> But this ceramic head makes it less painfull than other models.</li>
            <li> only downside I have to say is that it&#x27;s a little noisier than the epilators I&#x27;ve owned in the past.</li>
            <li> and I definitely want to reinforce to first time users that the pain is not that bad as you keep using it.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re impossible to clean.  </li>
            <li> Only after 15 years of using epilator it does not hurt my legs and armpits much, but it is extremely unpleasant.</li>
            <li> In my opinion totally NOT worth it on the legs.</li>
            <li> In this set, you get two different massaging attachments which help a lot with the pain, at least for me, and you get that trimmer head too.</li>
            <li> Absolutely not worth the money.</li>
            <li> The first use of a bit painful  Effect quite obvious</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not worth the money.  </li>
            <li> The first couple of times were painful (the same as plucking eyebrows</li>
            <li> I fully dried my legs since the directions state not to use on wet hair.</li>
            <li> It hurts, especially because I have thick hair.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone back over hairs that the Philips would not pick up with my old broken Emjoi and it picks up all the hairs that the Philips left behind (in between jamming/turning itself off every few seconds).</li>
            <li> When my last one started to slow down, I did some reading and found this one with ceramic tweezers.</li>
            <li> The attachments get a three star rating from me, but they do not bring down the value of the epilator itself.</li>
            <li> When it runs down it will be obnoxious to replace them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> When it runs down it will be obnoxious to replace them.    </li>
            <li> If my house burned down or someone stole my epilator, I&#x27;d suck it up and pay to get another Satin Perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s yanking hair out down to the root</li>
            <li> Threw it down a metal garbage chute.  </li>
            <li> As the epilator warns it can be pretty painful, but on top of that it also left her leg a little bloody on the parts she used it on.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ll keep, mainly because of wireless capability, but at home I&#x27;ll continuing relying on the old model to do the job :(</li>
            <li> Instead of a boring solid color print(s), the epilator sports a gorgeous white base color with a floral print on the front - very classy.</li>
            <li> If you have a regular amount of hair (like I do), this is just way too painful to practically use in large areas.</li>
            <li> Works as designed, though if you have thick hair, you will struggled a little bit to remove it properly.</li>
            <li> I was fearful at first that this product would leave nicks and cuts or painfully pull at hairs, but I was pleasantly surprised that the attachable blades glided across my skin easily and without the pain</li>
            <li> Pain level maybe 1 on 1-10 scale, but the skin is less irritated than depilatory or waxing.  </li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;Causes slight pain...Need to check how it reduces the hair growth...</li>
            <li> It also speeds up my epilating time because I feel less pain and can tolerate my epilator running over my skin for a longer period.  </li>
            <li> This one hurts A LOT LESS and doesn&#x27;t break the hairs off.</li>
            <li> The purple one broke half my hairs off and ripped out half.</li>
            <li> It hurts less than waxing.</li>
            <li> Because of previous reviews, I took two Tylenol capsules for the pain...</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t typically shave at all, so I put this puppy to task.</li>
            <li> While the shave it gave was probably not as close as what I&#x27;d get with a disposable razor, my skin was less irritated.  </li>
            <li> Your legs will be a lot smoother, and you&#x27;ll spend less time on hair removal.  </li>
            <li> Heed the advice of a previous member.</li>
            <li> /&gt;this is half of story.&lt;br /&gt;i ordered anothe one.</li>
            <li> less then 2 times.</li>
            <li> ive used it less then 2 times.</li>
            <li> everything done in much less time.&lt;br /&gt;the</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s not painless, but less so than a wax or tweezers and lasts longer than shaving.</li>
            <li> think all of those waxings and sugarings must have made me less</li>
            <li> I can get hair-free in a half hour any time</li>
            <li> think all of those waxings and sugarings must have made me less</li>
            <li> I can get hair-free in a half hour any time</li>
            <li> Compared to my previous Philips epilator I have much less ingrown hair than before.</li>
            <li> but I find it to not adequately remove all the hair, but maybe it&#x27;s just my hair type.</li>
            <li> and it got slightly easier to deal with.</li>
            <li> That one half of my leg didn&#x27;t need a shave for 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> the funny thing is I actually think it also help numb the skin because a few minutes in I hardly even feel the hairs being pulled anymore.  </li>
            <li> First few times using it is painful of course, but if you use this every few days you will see less and less hairs growing back.</li>
            <li> However it´s definitely not as good as the previous one I had even if they are the same brand.</li>
            <li> It creates a bit of a mess if you use it on your legs on your bathroom floor</li>
            <li> Shaving in the shower negates all that mess.  </li>
            <li> There is no waxy mess</li>
            <li> It hurts like crazy the first 5 seconds</li>
            <li> so you can use it on battery and take it to the bathtub so you don&#x27;t make a hairy mess all over your bathroom floor.</li>
            <li> Its basically giant motorized tweezers, its loud, rough and painful</li>
            <li> that although they don&#x27;t last, at least they work well for a little while!</li>
            <li> a head to &amp;#34;epilate&amp;#34; and one to shave + a few other accessories you can find in the description of the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In terms of pain, well its an epilator, dont expect no pain!</li>
            <li> The massaging attachments do little to numb the pain during the first epilating sessions.</li>
            <li> As expected it was painful on first usage.</li>
            <li> Our son likes the shaver - but he doesn&#x27;t shave often, so his \\&quot;beard\\&quot; (sssh, don&#x27;t tell him, but even at 21 he seems unlikely to achieve one) was long enough for the shaver to work.</li>
            <li> Mine was missing the shaving attachment, which is basically half the functionality of the product.</li>
            <li> This little guy retails for $150.</li>
            <li> The directions were just a TON of little images showing you what to and not to do.</li>
            <li> After reading about it I have to admit I was a little scared and</li>
            <li> I have to say I did get use to the pain (a little).</li>
            <li> If you can stand a little bit of pain</li>
            <li> I do a little each week.  </li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s a little pricey</li>
            <li> Its like waxing, it takes a little bit getting used to it!&lt;br /&gt;Of</li>
            <li> so I was a little scared.</li>
            <li> I was a little worried, after reading reviews about the pain level.</li>
            <li> you can see all the little hairs in the bottom.</li>
            <li> When I tentatively put it to my leg and felt how little pain there was</li>
            <li> When I tentatively put it to my leg and felt how little pain there was</li>
            <li> It hurts little</li>
            <li> Feels like you would imagine, pulling out each little hair.</li>
            <li> The little brush cleaned out the hair after each body part</li>
            <li> For me, it was just right and less painful than waxing...</li>
            <li> I admit seeing all the gross little hairs on the head and around where I was experimenting was unappealing.  </li>
            <li> I admit seeing all the gross little hairs on the head and around where I was experimenting was unappealing.  </li>
            <li> But no worries because I just let it grow out a few days and run this over a few little spots or two</li>
            <li> recommend you, but you have to be careful with too small hair, because it doesn&#x27;t work with too small hair</li>
            <li> the battery is not good, if you not use it  for a long time, maybe the battery will not work and can not charge.</li>
            <li> and when she gets it out she&#x27;s done in a few minutes.</li>
            <li> To help prevent this, I use exfoliating bath/shower gloves everyday on my legs to remove any excess dead/dry skin.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t mind thepain at all now that I&#x27;ve been using it for a few months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> There were a few hairs that were missed</li>
            <li> A few I can deal with</li>
            <li> I had used slower speed as recommended by few reviews.</li>
            <li> those  eventually went away in few hours.</li>
            <li> I started using it, after a few minutes I got used to the pain.  </li>
            <li> - I see a few complaints about ingrown hairs...but thank God I am not experiencing this issue.  </li>
            <li> Kinda messy...</li>
            <li> Kinda messy...</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll save money on razors and shaving cream, and you won&#x27;t be creating waste from disposable razors or blades.  </li>
            <li> However it stoped working after a few weeks.</li>
            <li> A few days before we purchased this my daughter paid out $50.00 per leg for a wax.  </li>
            <li> I can feel the occasional broken hair.  </li>
            <li> waste your time or money.</li>
            <li> Also will still be a few that it just won&#x27;t get and need to use tweezers.  </li>
            <li> Stopped using it after a few months of trial.</li>
            <li> I use the machine for &amp;#34;touchups&amp;#34; every few days or every week</li>
            <li> dead skin cells?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have been using a different model from Philips for two years, but I got tired of sharing it with my teenager.</li>
            <li> To add insult to injury, the illustrations do not fit any of the instructions.  </li>
            <li> Hair grows at uneven rates and will always be appearing.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it for a few months now</li>
            <li> waste of money for me.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> They never could quite get every hair, and I would have stubble in just a few days, even after repeatedly waxing for months.</li>
            <li> They never could quite get every hair, and I would have stubble in just a few days, even after repeatedly waxing for months.</li>
            <li> I do exfoliate everyday, however so this helps.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few months.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been quite a few years, and light-years in technology,</li>
            <li> but I needed a faster and cleaner method because waxing can be sticky and messy.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve tried a few.</li>
            <li> but I have to admit I dont look forward to doing it every few weeks.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Sorry, it turned out to be my mistake; I was not connecting the charger firmly to the unit.</li>
            <li> and it got broken at the second use, this things happen some times.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t even know these existed a few months ago</li>
            <li> I used it everyday.</li>
            <li> I trimmed down the hair and did it in small sections over the course of a week</li>
            <li> I got confidence with it quickly and even though I didn&#x27;t go out of my way to try cut myself, it seems very unlikely to injure you even when you&#x27;re pressing hard or at angles (on the shaver).  </li>
            <li> I got confidence with it quickly and even though I didn&#x27;t go out of my way to try cut myself, it seems very unlikely to injure you even when you&#x27;re pressing hard or at angles (on the shaver).  </li>
            <li> I just use the plain epilator one.  </li>
            <li> It is painful the first few times epilating.</li>
            <li> The first few pulls were about as painful as they come.</li>
            <li> It will meet all your expectations if you can look past the little details.</li>
            <li> Some people mentioned that it is less painful, I didn&#x27;t feel the difference, and I have very high tolerance for pain.&lt;br</li>
            <li> For my underarms, my hair grows in multiple directions, and it was impossible to remove any hair that grew in different directions or in the creases.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> /&gt;The first Epilator machines got a really bad wrap because they all had this pulling sensation.  </li>
            <li> Again, at first, there is sort of an &amp;#34;ouch&amp;#34; factor, but, you get used to it and find it&#x27;s not that bad at all.</li>
            <li> But I tried it on the side of my lower leg first after my shower and it wasn&#x27;t bad at all.</li>
            <li> The only real complaint I have is the noise.</li>
            <li> Not sure if the battery it came with was dead or what not.</li>
            <li> and I have dark and thick hairs), and even doing so</li>
            <li> I tried them out and for me, they made the process less painful, but it took a little longer than normal.  </li>
            <li> Plug in adapter is very tight...</li>
            <li> It works at least as well as this garbage, for $70 less.</li>
            <li> A little slow.</li>
            <li> After I let my epilator fully charge I was ready to give this bad boy a try.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t really pull my leg hair and caused my skin irritate so bad.  </li>
            <li> but once you get used to it, it&#x27;s really tolerable and isn&#x27;t so bad.</li>
            <li> kit also comes with a set up tweezers that lights up so you can see what you&#x27;re doing and has a small compact mirror.</li>
            <li> I usually have three weeks before I need a touch up.</li>
            <li> However, if you *would* like to get rid of your shaving routine but can&#x27;t afford to go to a salon for a wax every 3-4 weeks, do this:  - wax (preferably a few times; do NOT shave inbetween!)  </li>
            <li> Obviously it still hurts, but nothing that would make me shy away from using it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not really sure.</li>
            <li> The same unfortunately goes for this.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually post reviews, but all the reviews that I read helped me decide I&#x27;d risk</li>
            <li> I usually wax every 3 weeks but had always thought of using an epilator, but was worried about the pain.</li>
            <li> Here are a few tips to maximize your experience:  Exfoliate, exfoliate, exfoliate!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not really sure what the point of them are.  </li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t waste my time in shaving again!</li>
            <li> Using tweezers doesn&#x27;t create that problem so not sure why the epilator does.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I perhaps have has some issues with breaking instead of pulling some hairs causing</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the epilator only removes about 30% of the hair from my legs.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyways, I use this usually in my legs and bikini line.</li>
            <li> Let me tell you, its no more than someone pinching you.</li>
            <li> The women had the audacity to tell me that the person before told me wrong, that 2 day shipping is not an option and even if it was should have never assured me it would actually arrive in 2 days.</li>
            <li> I was always afraid when I used it on sensitive areas.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> It was also MUCH less painful than my old one.  </li>
            <li> I was shocked to see that there were 7 accessories/attachments that came with the main component (listed below).   </li>
            <li> This model is far worst than my still 100% working 10 years old \\&quot;PHILIPS satinelle HP6404\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> The assembly instructions are not very good</li>
            <li> It is not very good working.</li>
            <li> It gets less painful over time to where I now barely feel a thing on my legs.</li>
            <li> When I read other reviews before purchasing this, I didn&#x27;t think it would be /that/ bad, especially since I use an electric razor from time to time.&lt;br /&gt;-Instructions</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, the battery is a little weak.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize how bad it was until I got the new one.  </li>
            <li> I expressed my anger that this was not conveyed to me 3 weeks ago, but had them order the new color.</li>
            <li> are much less irritating.</li>
            <li> /&gt;And, painfully removing all the corse, dark, well - rooted body hair one can imagine, lavishly flinging it on the bathroom floor, white root follicle, and all.  </li>
            <li> will never buy any of their products,super unreliable,if I could I&#x27;d give a half star or worse .</li>
            <li> my hair is thin and less</li>
            <li> My initial review was rather optimistic about them, but once I put down my laptop and picked up the epilator, I came to term with the fact that epilating is and will always be painful.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not that bad - feels more like small electric shocks rather than actually painful.  </li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s seems less painful since you only doing it in shorter time.</li>
            <li> This one might be worth $150 to people who like slow, painful (and noisy!)</li>
            <li> Often times, when shaving, it is hard to see every hair because of lack of lightning.&lt;br</li>
            <li> which was hard.  </li>
            <li> which was hard.  </li>
            <li> I can hardly feel it removing hairs</li>
            <li> I could hardly put my arms at my sides, but now 1 month in</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to do this.</li>
            <li> at the beggining a little bit confused but</li>
            <li> Near my ankles pinched a lot but it wasn&#x27;t anything terribly bad.</li>
            <li> Nowhere near as painful as waxing.  </li>
            <li> It always snaps back from the tweezers, so I wait it out, like that awkward growing-out-your-bangs phase,</li>
            <li> At least with a shave</li>
            <li> The hair breakage is my biggest complaint.</li>
            <li> at least it won&#x27;t fall out by accident.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Unfortunately if you hit this while it&#x27;s running, the head comes off anyway and makes a partial connection.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately if you hit this while it&#x27;s running, the head comes off anyway and makes a partial connection.  </li>
            <li> I have terrible lighting in my bathroom, so the light is a plus.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it wasn&#x27;t what I expected.</li>
            <li> This, at least, helped me believe that I wasn&#x27;t torturing myself for no reason.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This, at least, helped me believe that I wasn&#x27;t torturing myself for no reason.  </li>
            <li> I found that the back of my legs was the least painful and the front top of my thighs was the worst.  </li>
            <li> Seems when I take a shower, I&#x27;m on my way someplace, and I&#x27;m always late.</li>
            <li> It works well even on delicate areas.</li>
            <li> However, I felt like the epilator did not really pull the hair out from the roots and just merely broke the hair from the skin.</li>
            <li> least with a razor</li>
            <li> But NOT FOR DELICATE AREAS including underarms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Hold the skin taught as you slowly move the device up your leg.........</li>
            <li> With that being said there is no pain like that of a slow torturous epilation.</li>
            <li> (it&#x27;s a slow process) because I had to give up in frustration.</li>
            <li> Proceed slow.</li>
            <li> but I worked slowly</li>
            <li> and since I&#x27;m sick of shaving everyday, I figured I&#x27;d finally buy one.</li>
            <li> If you get lazy and let the hair grow for weeks, you will notice that the pain gets worse.  </li>
            <li> I found this difficult to use, and ultimately not worth it.</li>
            <li> : I did not use any other attachments and not really care for them.&lt;br /&gt;Overall: don&#x27;t expect painless experience, justso you don&#x27;t get disappointed.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ridiculous</li>
            <li> Ridiculous amount of instructions.  </li>
            <li> Seriously though...</li>
            <li> Ridiculous amount of instructions.  </li>
            <li> Seriously though...</li>
            <li> Seriously, get an electric razor.</li>
            <li> seriously, how would it not hurt!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I found that the back of my legs was the least painful and</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll probably have to continue to shave my knees as it was nearly impossible for me to get my entire knee done (dang boney knees)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll probably have to continue to shave my knees as it was nearly impossible for me to get my entire knee done (dang boney knees)</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s getting easier and less uncomfortable each time.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not very good!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m so angry at this misleading mess.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Those are the only bad things I can think of.</li>
            <li> but if you have not used an epilator before I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it - it&#x27;s painful and not necessarily smoother than shaving.</li>
            <li> This is painful and you can actually feel the hair being pulled out by the root!</li>
            <li> After using it a third time, it is still painful, but my mind has blocked out the pain.</li>
            <li> , compared to an old epilator I have, this one does not pick up all the hair which is annoying.</li>
            <li> I was shocked at how heavy the little lipstick tube they come in was.</li>
            <li> After few days crying how bad was Panasonic, I bought that one.&lt;br /&gt;Im</li>
            <li> Honestly, my first impression of the OptiLight was terrible.</li>
            <li> During my first use, the pain was horrible.</li>
            <li> I suggest try on a tough patch of skin, like your knee maybe, before you venture to your legs.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t regret buying this tough, it works for me.</li>
            <li> My hair is also very thick but this did the job.</li>
            <li> Usually, after I pluck, it&#x27;s just days before I already need to pluck again!!</li>
            <li> Needless to say I hardly ever wear shorts, and I scraped my husband a lot while we were sleeping.</li>
            <li> It was what I expected, it hurt, but nothing too bad.  </li>
            <li> I think that the thin regrowth alone deserves two thumbs up.&lt;br</li>
            <li> was tired of shaving...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not saying that no hairs were broken off, some may have, but I saw a lot lf hairs that were pulled out.</li>
            <li> Not attractive to have bumpy legs.</li>
            <li> I will try it again some time when I have longer hair on my legs and see if that helps or makes it worse.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worse.  </li>
            <li> It hurts worse than getting a tattoo.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worse.  </li>
            <li> It hurts worse than getting a tattoo.  </li>
            <li> But before I get into the review, let me tell you The Secret of Epilating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;What&#x27;s the secret?  </li>
            <li> Now, here&#x27;s the secret.  </li>
            <li> you know the secret to epilation.  </li>
            <li> and i was tired to tears.</li>
            <li> but i can do behind the knee and underarms without a flinch.</li>
            <li> seriously, ow!  </li>
            <li> seriously, ow!  </li>
            <li> Really bad product,bought 2 and both stopped working in less than 3 months,for the price</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife and it is the less painful she ever tried.</li>
            <li> The ones that do will be thinner and it does become less painful.</li>
            <li> Hair removal is significantly less painful and post</li>
            <li> It worked wonders, but was a little painful of course.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t even call it painful at this point because there&#x27;s so few hairs being pulled out.</li>
            <li> Bikini area is by far the worst</li>
            <li> Waxing was extremely painful, bad for my sensitive skin, very expensive, time-consuming, and still didn&#x27;t work all that well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very weak.</li>
            <li> I also used it on my face and again the stinging was annoying and there was a little bit of pain, but</li>
            <li> I shave those everyday and that can get annoying, so</li>
            <li> Am i doing something wrong?  </li>
            <li> and so I thought it would be a useless feature.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I notice that when the hear is removed, the hair follicle bleeds which is a bit scary.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to pay to have it done because that could get expensive.</li>
            <li> Could my luck get any worse?!</li>
            <li> and I am not impressed.</li>
            <li> There is nothing wrong with charger</li>
            <li> Unfortunately there is no return policy.</li>
            <li> It is uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> Because, let&#x27;s face it, this thing is expensive.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this piece of crap for a few months now.</li>
            <li> i guess they use it in the wrong way.</li>
            <li> They are needlessly complicated and disorganized.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately there is no unit for pain measurement, but,</li>
            <li> so i did not find it that uncomfortable (</li>
            <li> This hurts worse than getting a tattoo!  </li>
            <li> and really sorry I bought this......</li>
            <li> Sometimes the rush took couple days to go away, so I could never use it before going out or hanging by the pool, cause it looked scary.</li>
            <li> It is still not perfect.</li>
            <li> This epilator is expensive</li>
            <li> and I would definitely recommend it if you hate shaving like I do!</li>
            <li> but unfortunately I forgot on one of my trips.</li>
            <li> It was very painful, but that could be due to the fact that I haven&#x27;t used an epilator for a while</li>
            <li> The pouch is very very thin and is not padded, so it is basically a bag where you throw in your items.</li>
            <li> To bad so sad</li>
            <li> However, after three months it inexplicably stopped working.</li>
            <li> but I kept going and seemed like my skin got numb.</li>
            <li> It has the wider cutting area to get done quicker.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I began to feel desperate.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I began to feel desperate.</li>
            <li> I was afraid of breaking things before even getting to try it out.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m too chicken to epilate under my arms</li>
            <li> I grow sideburns like a man, crazy genetics.</li>
            <li> Which was impossible before.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had a bad experience - no pinching skin or anything.  </li>
            <li> hurt so bad</li>
            <li> so I figured, how bad could it</li>
            <li> and then it didn&#x27;t seem as painful.  </li>
            <li> By this point I was so frustrated, I started looking up laser hair removal.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve never used an epilator before, but I&#x27;ve heard they can be painful.  </li>
            <li> It was so painful on my legs</li>
            <li> I hesitated to purchase it because I was under the impression that epilators were painful.  </li>
            <li> Of course painful a bit, but bearable</li>
            <li> but it was way to painful with even taking a Advil</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> It is exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li> This came, and it will not hold a charge at all.  When it&#x27;s plugged in it works fine but..I could&#x27;ve spent a lot less money if I wanted one that was plug in.</li>
            <li> This works well, is easy to use and maintain.  The process is not painless, but well within my tolerance level.  I&#x27;d been going to the salon for leg waxing for a couple years before I starting using this, so my leg hairs were already used to getting yanked.  I&#x27;ve had no problems with this product.  The light is shines on the area being worked is quite nice.  The fact that I can use it with of without the cord is a plus.  The shaver with the guard on it is very handy to get the hairs to the optimum length for the epilator head, especially when I wait a bit too long between sessions.</li>
            <li> I am so happy with this product ...it is a puss to get better when it&#x27;s come to touch it or looking at my legs , under arm or bikini area this really works and i didn&#x27;t feel that i lost my money on this product</li>
            <li> I read a lot of reviews on the Epilator before actually buying it. I expected the pain that hit initially from the rapid plucking, but was extremely pleased with the results! With this one in particular, the &amp;#34;massager&amp;#34; attachment with the plastic rollers on both sides works best.</li>
            <li> This has been in a box for about a week until I got brave enough to use it based on my past very brief excruciating experience with an epilady many years ago.  This epilator is nothing like that contraption.  I bought this because I am fed up with shaving my legs all the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First to test, I did the little tiny hairs on my knuckles, zero pain, quickly gone.  Next, I did the line on my stomach.  Pain level maybe 1 on 1-10 scale, but the skin is less irritated than depilatory or waxing.  I did the pesky chin hairs, zero pain, got all but one of the thicker hairs that was really short.  I got braver and did some bikini area.  Pain level is about a 3.  I was leery of doing to whole area in one go, so I did some.  Nowhere near as painful as waxing.  I personally consider waxing 7-8 in terms of pain, especially there.  It works better if you pull the skin taut because it seems like the pain is more from skin pulling in curvy areas rather than the hair coming out.  Washed and dried it, did under my left armpit.  Pain level 3 for areas closer to where there is no hair, like going towards the upper arm or towards the chest.  Pain level 1ish middle of armpit.  Again, it seems like the pain is from skin getting irritated, not the hair coming out.  I guess my hair isn&#x27;t long enough to grab there so not so effective, but there is a definite difference as compared to right armpit which I left alone to compare.  Also, the skin under my arms doesn&#x27;t seem to get totally dry no matter how much I dry it, so maybe that&#x27;s why it isn&#x27;t picking up as much, too.  It has been a few hours since I did the underarm, it feels tender, but the same sort of feeling as after waxing.  The other areas feel totally normal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t do my legs because I shaved recently and the hair isn&#x27;t long enough yet.  I also want to see what kind of irritation occurs the day after.  So far, I like it, can&#x27;t say I love it yet until I know what my skin will feel like tomorrow or how my legs will fare.  I do love that there is no mess.ll fare.  I do love that there is no mess.</li>
            <li> Definitely more comfortable than expected.  Tweezers in well-designed case.  Pouch excellent for containing all parts.  Easy to use.  Very satisfied.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this. She only has to use it once a month and when she gets it out she&#x27;s done in a few minutes.</li>
            <li> Its a good product....&lt;br /&gt;Used it only once yet....&lt;br /&gt;Causes slight pain...Need to check how it reduces the hair growth... If it reduces hair growth then that pain is bearable :)</li>
            <li> Felt this product was average as far as epilators go.  I have another epilators from emjoi that works a little better, but wanted to try this one as the reviews were so good.  I do like the light as the emjoi doesn&#x27;t, but the overall performance I felt was not as good as I thought it would be.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m writing this review because I was on the fence about whether or not to buy this product and wanted to provide some helpful info for others considering it.  Overall, I&#x27;m very happy with the product and I get good results.  FIRST, let me say that the first time you use this, IT WILL HURT.  Before the first use, I let the hair on my legs grow out quite a bit and then trimmed with the included shaver head to the suggested length for optimal epilation (in the instruction manual).  Then I started with the epilator head and I about cried in pain and wondered why in the bleep did I buy this thing?!?  I was determined to finish, though, so I endured the pain.  I did get red spots on my legs where the hair was pulled, but the spots were completely gone by the next day and they only seem to appear now when the hair is longer or denser (i.e. going longer between epliating sessions).  The epilator does not remove EVERY SINGLE HAIR, so if your objective is baby butt smooth legs, this product may not be for you.  However, the hairs it leaves are very fine and very short and not noticeable to the eye, but only to touch.  This is acceptable to me.  The included shaver attachment works very well, so you could run the shaver over your legs after epilating if you need a very smooth finish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read in other reviews that after epilating, the hair grows back slower and finer.  I did not believe this, because with shaving it seems the opposite is true.  I can attest that with epilating, the hair does, indeed, grow back slower and finer.  I am very pleased with this aspect of epilation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have experienced some ingrown hairs that present like tiny pimples.  To help prevent this, I use exfoliating bath/shower gloves everyday on my legs to remove any excess dead/dry skin.  These gloves are available at a very reasonable price on amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, pain greatly diminishes on subsequent uses because there are fewer hairs each time you epilate.  I don&#x27;t mind thepain at all now that I&#x27;ve been using it for a few months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not used it on my underarms or bikini area, so I cannot comment on its effectiveness in those areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OVERALL, I&#x27;m very happy with this product and consider it money well spent.</li>
            <li> Definitely not painLESS but effective. I found it best to work through in stages (I bought it for my legs) over the course of an evening / taking breaks and then it didn&#x27;t seem as painful.  But get real - it&#x27;s a spinning head of tiny tweezers pulling out each hair at the root - did you expect it to feel good?  Even after first use I can definitely see slower regrowth.  I haven&#x27;t had any problem with maintaining charge and the 40 minutes it is said to run for hasn&#x27;t been an issue either.</li>
            <li> this phillips epilator works like a charm.  i had a remington epi and had to use it daily because it just would not get all the hair.  i would sit for hours and epi with the remington - had rotating heads.  THE PHILLIPS is 1000 times better.  i epi&#x27;d my legs a week ago and you can still feel nothing!!!  I AM SO PLEASED.  I wish I had bought this one in the first place.  i had the old one for over a year and the motor burned out and i was forced to buy a new one.  THANK HEAVENS ....  or i never would have found THE PHILLIPS EPI.....thank you!!!</li>
            <li> Pulls hairs out and leaves bleeding bumps on skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m female, age 49, and partial to razor blades, the sharper the better. Battery operated noise never seems to accompany improved performance in any chore, with one exception, my rechargeable chain saw (not an amazon vine item).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cute packaging of this $150 razor appealed to my 15-yr-old daughter, who had no better luck than I did with the epilator (ouch, and no smooth shave; pain but no gain). She loved the cute battery-lighted tweezers in its lipstick-sized tube. The light is a great idea, but for me, the tweezers didn&#x27;t work. If you have a long enough eyebrow hair, sure, any tweezers will do. But hair just growing in? It always snaps back from the tweezers, so I wait it out, like that awkward growing-out-your-bangs phase, only this is tormently often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband likes all the trimming attachments. Our son likes the shaver - but he doesn&#x27;t shave often, so his \\&quot;beard\\&quot; (sssh, don&#x27;t tell him, but even at 21 he seems unlikely to achieve one) was long enough for the shaver to work. Nothing, but nothing, beats a sharp manual razor for a close, smooth shave, esp on a one-day growth of whiskers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The \\&quot;massage\\&quot; didn&#x27;t appeal to any of us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: the quiet snick of a sharp blade beats any gadget I&#x27;ve ever seen. This one might be worth $150 to people who like slow, painful (and noisy!) hair removal. I&#x27;d rather risk a swift, silent cut-and-bleed than a prolonged and tortuous hair-pulling session.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;p.s. Blades are portable. Our other daughter will study in Spain all year, so nothing that plugs in here will work there. The ol&#x27; razor blade wins again.</li>
            <li> A review on the Philips HP6576/50 Satin Perfect Deluxe Epilator, and not a story about my first epilating experience:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first thing I noticed about the epilator before even taking it out of the box was the beautiful design. Instead of a boring solid color print(s), the epilator sports a gorgeous white base color with a floral print on the front - very classy. The see-through \\&quot;glass\\&quot; (it is actually plastic) effect on the front is also very attracting. The cosmetic aspect of the epilator is definitely a plus in my book.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Onto the actual product, the epilator is nice middle ground weight. From this, you can get a good grip and can control precise motions. The feel of the epilator is okay, but I think Philips could have done better. I believe the outside of the body is made entirely of plastic, which makes it feel cheaper than you would guess. I also would have liked it better if there was a grip piece on both sides. The epilator hasn&#x27;t slipped from my hands yet during epilating, but an actual grip would provide better security. On the front, you can find the OptiLight and the \\&quot;on\\&quot; button. Honestly, my first impression of the OptiLight was terrible. I thought that it would be great for someone who would use the epilator in the dark (for some strange reason...) However, after using the epilator for a while, I absolutely love it. The OptiLight allows you to see even the tiniest and lightest hairs(which is great for me because I have dark hair.) Even in a well-lit room, the OptiLight never fails to impress me. The light is very bright and has good spread [distance.] Moving to the \\&quot;on\\&quot; button, I have only one thing to say about it. Okay -- maybe more because of my explanation. I really, absolutely dislike the button. It looks nice and fits in with the cosmetic theme, but the button does not meet my Philip expectations. It is a single push button, so you basically click the button for every function - turning it on/off and switching the power settings. First of all, using just one button for everything will wear down the epilator more easily. The epilator may not have as much life as one that has a \\&quot;switch\\&quot; type of button (where you go up or down depending on the preferred speed.) If I wanted just to epilate my underarms, I would have to click twice just to get to the lower speed setting. For someone that may have sensitive skin to begin with and needs the lower setting every single time, this would be a hassle. The push button I think is an incredibly stupid design. Another downfall of the push button is the \\&quot;effectiveness\\&quot; of switching to the lower setting. When first turning on the epilator and going straight to the second speed setting, or switching over to the lower speed setting while the epilator is on, it is sometimes difficult to know whether you have successfully selected the setting (the sound difference between the two speeds is very minimal so this may be hard to determine success.) This means that I will always have to pick up my epilator (if I am already epilating this is a pain) and look at the front to see if I am in the right speed setting. My dislike for the button does not really affect the epilator performance, but I think that feature could have been better thought out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though the epilator itself works very well, the bonus attachments that come with the deluxe model provide a more optimal performance. There are a total of 4 attachments, each of which comes very handy. I absolutely love the active hair lifter attachment, especially on my legs - as the hairs tend to lay flat. I also find that there is more hair pickup than without the attachment, so I don&#x27;t have to run my epilator over the same area as much. The active massaging system with pivoting cap attachment also works really well. This is my favorite attachment out of the whole set because the pain from epilating is slightly diminished. However, I wish that the massagers were also \\&quot;active\\&quot; as well, like the massager on the active hair lifter attachment. I feel that if the massagers were self-rotating, this would provide even more comfort when epilating. Aside from that, I really love the attachment. It also speeds up my epilating time because I feel less pain and can tolerate my epilator running over my skin for a longer period.  Last but not least, there is the shaving/trimming attachment. I think these attachments boost the value of the epilator.  If for some reason I had a skin irritation, and did not want to risk the effect of plucking my hairs out in that spot, I could use the shaving attachment. For hair that may be too long for optimum epilating, the trimming attachment could be used. Generally speaking, the shaving attachment is convenient for someone who prefers shaving a certain area over epilating, and the trimming attachment is great to trim down any long hairs. Overall, each attachment offers an improved epilating experience. They speed up the process, decrease pain, and may even replace your shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another bonus that comes with the deluxe model is the Illuminating Smart Tweezers. I do not care much for this; the concept is good, but I find my cheap 99 cent tweezers from Dillions does a better job. There is an \\&quot;OptiLight\\&quot; - which initially seems great because it never seems we can get good lighting to pluck and maintain our eyebrows. However, the light - which is located in between the two clamps of the tweezers - is very bright. No matter how many times I try to motivate myself to use the tweezers, I cannot find a way to utilize them so that I am not blinded by the light. For people that can use the tweezers however, the light pinpoints a specific area extremely well. Because of the placement of the OptiLight, a tight grip is required to clamp down on individual hairs. I also feel that the tweezers&#x27; shape or cut does not work as well as my other tweezers. The mirror that is included is a great tool to go along with the tweezers. It has great zoom - probably a2 or even 3x zoom. This is great because it is no longer a hassle to go very close to a bathroom mirror for those stubborn hairs. The packaging of the tweezers is okay, but not terrific. There is risk of scratching the mirror as you place the tweezers back into the container. Also, I feel like I will damage either the mirror or the tweezers every time I open or close the container. It would have been smart to integrate a twist feature (like that of a water bottle) or a snap lock.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel that some people would not care about this, but I think it something worth mentioning. The charger seems really cheap; it is really light (which could be a good thing for some) and made out of plastic. I wish the appearance - material and shape - had been better. Also, I was initially very afraid that I received a dud. However, the charger should work, but you must first hear a big CLICK sound when you plug the cord into your epilator. I made the mistake of being too gentle and didn&#x27;t push it in hard enough. Then (I really love this part), a pretty battery shaped light will be lit on the front of the epilator. It will pulse for certain duration and the light will disappear for the rest of the time, until after the epilator is completely charged. It does not take long at all for the epilator to charge. I believe it only takes around an hour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing that may not bother a lot of people but bothers me is the travel case/pouch that comes in the box. It&#x27;s great for stuffing all of my equipment in there - my epilator, tweezers, attachments, and charger. And exactly like what it would sound like, you will run the risk of damaging something. The thing I am most worried about is the actual epilator. The pouch is very very thin and is not padded, so it is basically a bag where you throw in your items. Not to mention it barely fits all of the items. I will most likely use the pouch for the attachments and the charger, and will probably use a separate makeup bag to storemy epilator. At the minimal the pouch could have had separate pockets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall: I cannot speak for all epilators (this is my first), but I can gather from my personal experience [with the Philips Satin Perfect Deluxe Epilator (HP6576/50)] that this is a great epilator. Spending a bit more money with the deluxe model will grant you a few bonuses, but the product works really well by itself (Philips HP6576/60 Satin Perfect Epilator). The Philips Satin Perfect Epilator is a bit overpriced, but it can be a good investment to make. It will meet all your expectations if you can look past the little details. I definitely recommend this to anyone who is looking for a reliable epilator. It can also be used cordlessly -- definitely a plus. I would also recommend the deluxe model, as you are getting a multifunctional tool (epilator and shaver) that you will absolutely love. This baby will not be going anywhere, and I hope it lasts a really long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sincerely,&lt;br /&gt;An unbiased BzzAgent -- going into epilating without any prior experience and not reading the specialties before hand&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;** I DO RECOMMEND THAT ALL INSRUCTIONS SHOULD BE READ BEFORE DOING ANYTHING, IN ORDER TO CORRECTLY USE AND CARE FOR YOUR EPILATOR!**</li>
            <li> Fantastic. Very accurate and efficient, charge lasts long time and led light makes it easy to use.</li>
            <li> Wife said it is doing a good job but slightly painful as it pulls hair.</li>
            <li> I initially purchased this for my wife, but have tried it out myself. Both my wife and I love the results. She uses it several times a week, and we&#x27;re already saving money not having to purchase so many razors and shaving accessories. The results are long lasting. There&#x27;s a little bit of pain when you first start, but you get used to it after a few sessions. Once you see the results, nothing else will matter.</li>
            <li> very good product, hurts as all the others of this category, but is supportable. Is very modern with different funcions</li>
            <li> This personal female groomer is a must have for those who like to keep things nice and neat. I was fearful at first that this product would leave nicks and cuts or painfully pull at hairs, but I was pleasantly surprised that the attachable blades glided across my skin easily and without the pain that normal hair removal is known for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This epilator comes with four different attachments for the fine to courser hair. I especially like that this tool has a light on it to make it easy to see fine hairs. Often times, when shaving, it is hard to see every hair because of lack of lightning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The epilator is chargeable and works while being charged. The long cord on the charger comes in handy depending on where your electrical outlets are placed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This kit also comes with a set up tweezers that lights up so you can see what you&#x27;re doing and has a small compact mirror. The tweezers do come with batteries; however, mine did not work when I received the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over all, I like this product and will get much use from it.</li>
            <li> After 2-1/2 years of elipating, most of my hairs are either coming back as baby fine blonde hairs or not at all. I can&#x27;t believe how smooth my legs feel all the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started with the corded purple Philips epilator with steel discs but switched to this cordless ceramic disc model. Big difference. This one hurts A LOT LESS and doesn&#x27;t break the hairs off. The purple one broke half my hairs off and ripped out half. Plus being corded was an inconvenience. This ceramic one more quickly rips most if not all of the hairs out for longer results. I now epilate every week or two and it doesn&#x27;t hurt my legs at all. It barely hurts my armpits but it still isn&#x27;t pleasant on my bikini area. I do get ingrown hairs in the bikini area if I don&#x27;t exfoliate regularly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two things to keep in mind when starting. Shave first and then start epilating on a daily basis two days later. That way you aren&#x27;t attacking all your hairs at once since regrowth isn&#x27;t perfectly uniform even with shaving. Also take an aspirin or have a glass of wine. It is painful the first few times epilating. It gets less painful over time to where I now barely feel a thing on my legs.</li>
            <li> item is as described and price is fair. good service and prompt delivery. Satisfied</li>
            <li> works great...alittle painful on the legs more then other areas..but you do get used to it...finally don&#x27;t have to shave every day!!</li>
            <li> I had an older version of satin epilator, but after several years it stop working. I bought this new version and found out it is getting better. I just love this new version.</li>
            <li> Worked very well for me.&lt;br /&gt;Accesories make the difference!</li>
            <li> this has been one of the best products and return on the money one can expect. Although sometimes it hurts to use, once I desensitize, it works great.</li>
            <li> This is the first and only Epilator I have purchased and I have owned it for over a year. This is the question to ask yourself before you purchase this-- Is the pain worth not shaving for a few weeks? The honest truth is, this thing hurts. It is literally ripping your hairs out by the root. Anyway you spin it, this just doesn&#x27;t feel good. BUT--&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  It is totally worth the pain for the perfect bikini area for me. This is the most use I have gotten out of the product. I use it on bikini area for a fairly flawless appearance. Shaving that area never produces good results for me. I always get ingrown hairs and the area always appears irritated after a shave. With the epilator I get almost no ingrown hairs. After use the area is very irritated, I do not suggest using this right before you throw of a bikini. I usually use it the day before, and by the next morning things look great. And they STAY that way. I usually have three weeks before I need a touch up. After using it consecutively, over a period of time, I have found the pain is much more bearable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  In my opinion totally NOT worth it on the legs. I would much rather just shave or wax. The pain on the legs is just too intense. I find that it wont get all the hairs in one pass, so over and over I have to use it in the same spot. At least with a shave it&#x27;s painless and with a wax it&#x27;s one time in each area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  If you have used epilators in the past and are looking for an upgrade, this is a great device. I find myself using it so much because it has so many functions. With one device you can shave and epilate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some other things about this epilator--&lt;br /&gt;- The device stays charged for a long time. I don&#x27;t often have to charge it, and if for some reason I do have to charge while in use, the cord is pretty long.&lt;br /&gt;- While it is a little loud, the sound isn&#x27;t unbearable.&lt;br /&gt;- The device cleans really easy and is simple to take apart and put together.&lt;br /&gt;- The white bag is really handy. It keeps all the attachments together and is inconspicuous in my bathroom vanity.&lt;br /&gt;- The shaving head works great. Easy to use and effective.&lt;br /&gt;- There are two speeds which is really great, I use change between the two a lot. Having the slower speed in nice when you are going over knobby areas like the knees/elbows.&lt;br /&gt;- Tweezers are cute but sort of useless. A nice addition but I don&#x27;t often use them.ally handy. It keeps all the attachments together and is inconspicuous in my bathroom vanity.&lt;br /&gt;- The shaving head works great.

            <li> I got this for my wife but she found that the epilator function doesn&#x27;t give her a good shave on her legs (at least for the small part that she could stand to use it on). As the epilator warns it can be pretty painful, but on top of that it also left her leg a little bloody on the parts she used it on. She found that it worked better on her feet where there is less hair (and the hair is less coarse). So be careful with the epilator functionality with this device.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The part that she definitely likes is the razor attachment - it gives a nice, smooth shave without any trouble. But I&#x27;m not convinced that that shave is worth the price (I think a good wet/dry shaver alone costs less than this device).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fancy tweezers that come with this package are a nice bonus, as is the massage head. If you&#x27;re into epilating at home go for it but if you have not used an epilator before I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it - it&#x27;s painful and not necessarily smoother than shaving.</li>
            <li> Yes, it hurts, of course it does. I&#x27;d never used an epilator before and hesitated before trying it, but my friend swears by hers. I tested it on my arm first and could hardly steel myself to use it again. I applied some No Scream Cream 45 minutes before doing my legs for the first time, though, and it hurt much less--after a while I was watching my TV show with only the occasional wince as I stripped my legs of hair. Tweezing my eyebrows used to hurt, too, and now I think nothing of it. I recommend using the trim attachment first to leave the hair a uniform length before using the epilator, if you have it. I plan to continue using this wonderful little device, especially considering how clean it leaves my legs. Big fan!</li>
            <li> First of all, I was very lucky to have been sent this product to try for free from BzzAgent.  I&#x27;d actually never even heard of an epilator before this campaign, so after I did a little research, I was pretty excited to try it out. I&#x27;ve used the epilator for about 10 days now and here&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve come up with:  Price:  This little guy retails for $150. That may seem like a lot at first but it&#x27;s an investment. Also, this would replace all those cheap disposable razors you buy at Target. Some quick math would show that you probably spend about $130 or more a year on those. This product could cover my legs, underarms, and if I&#x27;m daring enough, my bikini line. If you&#x27;re just looking to try out the epilator head without any additional attachments, I would recommend skipping the deluxe version and getting [[ASIN:B005BOQHB6 Philips HP6576/60 Satin Perfect Epilator, White/Purple]].  Attachments:  The deluxe version comes with the active hair lifter, active massaging system with pivoting cap, shaving head, trimming comb, and illuminating smart tweezers. I&#x27;ve used both the active hair lifter and active massaging system attachments in place of the original one and I am not impressed with either. I don&#x27;t feel like they really do anything extra. I haven&#x27;t used the trimming comb but I have used the shaving head attachment. I&#x27;ve never actually used an electric shaver before and found it to be surprisingly convenient. It creates a bit of a mess if you use it on your legs on your bathroom floor but boy, it&#x27;s way faster than shaving in the shower.  The illuminating smart tweezers are so great they deserve their own paragraph. I LOVE these tweezers. They come in a little tube (similar to lipstick) so they&#x27;re super easy to carry in your purse. My favorite part is the little LED light on them. You don&#x27;t need to sit in a very well lit place to touch up your brows anymore! It really is wonderful.  Epilator Experience:  Since I had never used an epilator before, I whipped out the directionsthat came in the box. You would not believe how awful they were. I forgot to take a picture but I will do so later and attach it on here. The directions were just a TON of little images showing you what to and not to do. I stared at them for quite a while until I finally tossed them aside and decided to figure it out myself, which really wasn&#x27;t that hard. After letting the epilator charge for a little while (it charges pretty fast), I decided to give it a go on my leg. You have to wait for the hair to grow a bit before you can test it out, so I waited about 3-4 days for this.  My first reaction was \\&quot;Holy $#%!, that&#x27;s loud!\\&quot; The sound that comes out of this little guy is so surprisingly that it scared me to use it. After I got over that, I started to test the epilator on my shin and then immediately turned the epilator off. Now let me say that I consider myself to be very tolerant of pain. In college, I got 11 piercings and 9 tattoos. I would say that the pain from the epilator is comparable to getting a tattoo. That may scare anyone off at first but I sucked it up and continued on. The epilator has two speeds, so you might want to start with the slower one, though I didn&#x27;t find it to make a difference. I will say that it DOES GET EASIER after the first few times over the same area. It took me 3 nights to do both of my legs.  I would actually only recommend using the epilator at night. A few hours after using it, you legs will be VERY red and have all these unflattering, tiny red bumps all over them. Don&#x27;t worry, they will be gone by morning! Luckily I had this amazing targeted gel lotion called [[ASIN:B0036BFUOU Shaveworks The Cool Fix Gel Lotion - 2 oz]]. It smells amazing, provided me with soothing relief immediately, and targets ingrown hairs, razor bumps, razor burn, and redness. I would strongly recommend using this product following the epilator. Also, you&#x27;ll want to exfoliate the night before and the next morning to prevent ingrown hairs. I use Lush&#x27;s Aqua Mirabilis Body Butter bar. It uses ground almond shells to exfoliate and the combination of sandalwood and rose oils smells AMAZING. It is absolutely one of my most favorite scents. So yeah, get those.  The results?  Well, it&#x27;s been a week and I haven&#x27;t had to use the epilator again yet. I don&#x27;t care how much pain I have to get used to, this thing is amazing. I&#x27;m Greek, French, and a brunette- being able to go this long without shaving is wonderful. There were a few hairs that were missed but perhaps they weren&#x27;t long enough. Since the epilator has an LED light on it, I was able to spot most of the little hairs that maybe I would have missed otherwise. So if you are able to tolerate a little pain and hate having to shave every other day, I would strongly recommend that you try out this epilator. If you don&#x27;t care for all the attachments, get the basic model. I&#x27;m going to try out the epilator on my underarms. I shave those everyday and that can get annoying, so I&#x27;ll let you know how that goes!</li>
            <li> If I knew that it would be so great I had bought it a long time ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very used to waxing, so the pain don&#x27;t bothers me at all. I like this epilator because I can do by myself, easily and fast, any time I want, and the price is great! I was paying a lot of money for the waxing, like US$140/month and now I&#x27;m super happy to be saving this for others things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can do armpits and legs in a heartbeat, super easy. If you want a little more, like a Brazilian wax, like me, you&#x27;ll need a little bit more time and some training at first, but is very doable. You&#x27;ll a expert in a couple of months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update (July 05, 2015): I bought another one, a gift to my sister. Mine is up and running. Great product.</li>
            <li> From other reviews I was expecting this process to be agonizing but it&#x27;s not that bad - feels more like small electric shocks rather than actually painful.  It&#x27;s very easy to use once you figure out which attachment is for what.  The instructions are lengthy and quite helpful but the diagrams all look the same.</li>
            <li> Ouch. Am i doing something wrong?  Works but ouch.</li>
            <li> The primary use for this product is epilation, i.e. uprooting of the hairs, which is done by tweezer-like rotating disks. It comes with a shaver/trimmer attachment head, but that is just a plus, not the main thing (do not get this gadget just for shaving - you have many other options that are far better and cheaper).  Given the previous reviews, let me start with DO NOT get this product if:  - you never waxed/epilated before and/or  - your pain threshold is low.   It plucks hairs. It freaking hurts. I have not shaved my legs since last century, yet using this epilator is still at the bottom of my preferred activities list. So. You&#x27;re warned.  However, if you *would* like to get rid of your shaving routine but can&#x27;t afford to go to a salon for a wax every 3-4 weeks, do this:  - wax (preferably a few times; do NOT shave inbetween!)  - come back here to find a product that&#x27;s right for you; the pain becomes bearable after the hairs have been pulled out of their follicles a few times.  Now, for the pros like myself: this is by far the best epilator I have owned. I basically remove *all* the visible hair below my waist line, and this thing is very friendly to the sensitive areas, since it has ceramic disks. I just got rid of [[ASIN:B000EZYKTS Braun 5270 X&#x27;elle Body System Epilator]] which has metal disks that tear and damage your skin - thus I still had to wax some parts, which kinda defeats the purpose of owning an epilator for a quick and cheap at-home hair removal.  In this set, you get two different massaging attachments which help a lot with the pain, at least for me, and you get that trimmer head too. If you don&#x27;t need the massaging thingies nor the trimmer, then just go for the cheaper option [[ASIN:B005BOQHB6 Philips HP6576/60 Satin Perfect Epilator, White/Purple]].  Another tip: it hurts much less if you use it on the second or third day of your period, or right after it. The skin stays smoother for longer too, with less ingrowns (use gentle loofah every day andyou&#x27;ll be fine - my waxing lady told me to do it and I&#x27;ve had no problems with \\&quot;over-exfoliating\\&quot; my skin).</li>
            <li> I was very intrigued by epilators about a year back and was so intrigued that I purchased a Braun one with little metal disks rather than the ceramic ones like this product contains. I was expecting pain and torture along with bright red legs for hours and hours. (Oh, don&#x27;t forget the itchy skin). Well, I decided to go with this product again because I wanted to see if a more expensive one was really worth it.  In my opinion, it definitely is! My Braun epilator I used to have was about 30 dollars, so fairly cheap, this one not so much. I opened the box to find a GIGANTIC set of instructions. Wow! So, I skimmed through them. I knew how an epilator worked, I just needed to figure out how to attach/detach all of the heads.  Now let me just say, compared to my old 30$ Braun metal disc epilator, this one is amazing. Obviously it still hurts, but nothing that would make me shy away from using it. It&#x27;s an epilator, it&#x27;s supposed to hurt. So, that being said, I can now talk about my experience.  I first used the epilator as it came, with just the normal head and such with no attachments. It worked wonders, but was a little painful of course. So, I decided to go ahead and attach the head with the massagers on it. I can honestly say that the massagers vibrating really took away from a lot of the pain. Maybe the tickling of the vibration? I&#x27;m not really sure. Anyways...  After I tried the massagers (the guiding head) I had to try out the shaver. I&#x27;m not a fan of electric razors, if I am going to shave, I like to use a regular bladed razor. The same unfortunately goes for this. I just don&#x27;t feel like the razor really gets close enough to do anything. It does chop all of the hair, but not as close to my skin as I would like. I also don&#x27;t every see myself having long enough hair to ever use the trimmer attachment.  Also, the light on the epillator is amazing in my opinion. My old one didn&#x27;t have a light and so I thought it would be a useless feature. But I turned it on and the light helps you see all of the little hairs you wouldn&#x27;t before. Now I have dark hair, so I can see a lot without the light, but I can only imagine if I had blonde hair, this would be a Godsend.  The last thing I would like to say is about the tweezers. OH MY GOSH! I have never had a pair of tweezers that weren&#x27;t just two little metal sticks hooked together in the center. These are amazing. I was shocked at how heavy the little lipstick tube they come in was. I opened the tube to find a micro mirror perfect for on the go tweezing and then I flipped the little LED light on. Even if I never use the tweezers on the go, atleast I&#x27;ll have the little light in case of emergency. It is really bright.  The only real complaint I have is the noise. It is definitely noisier than my old Braun one, but the pro&#x27;s far outweigh that one con. Also, it&#x27;s a bunch of spinning tweezers clapping together, so I know it will be noisey to some degree.  I would definitely recommend this item, not as a shaver, but as an epilator. And if you like electric shavers too, then all the more power to this product.</li>
            <li> Love this epilator.  I had an old one that just wasn&#x27;t working too well.  I didn&#x27;t realize how bad it was until I got the new one.  Plan on getting one for both my daughter and my daughter in law for Christmas!</li>
            <li> I am in love. This is my first epilator and its great. I like the other heads for it. I can use it with or without the cord. It hurt the first time i did it but gets more and more tolerable. But to be hair free for 1-2 weeks is well worth it.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> Goodbye shaving! I can&#x27;t believe a man had to tell me about this at the age of 39! The pain is no big deal, goes by fast and you&#x27;re hairless for 3 weeks. Beats stubble 5 hours later. This is a must have for all women.</li>
            <li> In all honesty epilating will hurt at first.  However, with time it HONESTLY does get better.  Showering or taking a hot bath beforehand makes all the difference in the world.  When I first used this product I did not use it after showering and it hurt a lot worse.  It was a beginner mistake that I don&#x27;t want anyone else to make!  Once you use it a few times it does not hurt as much.  Pros:  The superiority of this model versus the other cheaper models is that you can attach the epilator head or the electric razor head.  The electric razor head does not get as close, but it is a great option if you are in a hurry.  Also for new users of epilators like me the razor allows you to trim your leg hair shorter beforehand so that the epilation process hurts a lot less!  Cons:  The noise it makes is intimidating and will have you scared to try it. Power through and sum up your bravery because the noise makes sounds like it will be more painful than it is.  Don&#x27;t let others opinion of an epilator scare you off.  Some people had me so terrified with horror stories of the epilator that I regretted getting it at first, until I tried it for myself and saw the results that allowed me to go a long time without having to worry about my leg hair and having softer, finer, and blonder leg hair that grew in.</li>
            <li> I was lucky enough to be able to try the Philips Satin Perfect Epilator for free courtesy of Bzzagent.com (check them out, love them[...])!    Let me first start with everything you receive when you purchase the Philips Satin Perfect Epilator (retail value around $150.00). Inside the box was a cute little white zippered bag to keep all of the attachments that come with the epilator in one place! I was shocked to see that there were 7 accessories/attachments that came with the main component (listed below).   1.Basic Epilation Cap - To be used if you already have some experience using an epilator.  2.Optimal Performance Cap - To be used if you are new to epilation. It ensures optimal skin  contact where the pivoting head stretches the skin and prepares the hair for epilation.  3.Active Hair Lifter with Active Massage - This cap should be used if your hair lies flat on your skin. It helps to lift the hair up off the skin and the massager helps to minimize the pulling sensation of the epilation.  4.Shave, Trim and Style Attachment - This is used to shave sensitive areas such as your underarms and bikini area and legs.  5.Trimming Comb - This will only fit onto the above attachment (Shave, /trim and Style Attachment) and is used to trim your hair before epilation at a recommended length of about 1/8\\&quot;.  6.Cleaning Brush - Used to clean your epilator after each use.   7.Adapter - Used to charge your epilator - Takes approximately 1 hour to full charge and can be used for cordless operation for about 40 minutes.   I have never used an epilator before, to tell you the truth when I was chosen to try this I had to actually look up what an epilator was! After reading about it I have to admit I was a little scared and my first thought was Ouch! For those of you who don&#x27;t know, an epilator, in basic terms is an electrical device (looks like an electric shaver) used to remove hair by grasping multiple hairs simultaneously (think a bunch of tiny little tweezers) and pulling them out by the root.    Now the fun part (Well um maybe).....    After I let my epilator fully charge I was ready to give this bad boy a try. I prepped my legs by exfoliating because I thought it might help to soften the hair follicle and help with any ingrown hairs I may have. I fully dried my legs since the directions state not to use on wet hair. I chose to use the Optimal Performance Cap since this was my first time ever using an epilator. Okay I was now prepped and ready.    I turned the device on before using it just to see how it worked. I was not expecting it to be as loud as it was! This scared me a little more seeing how fast those little tweezers were moving. There are two speeds. The faster one is for larger areas such as your legs and the slower one is for smaller areas such as your underarms. Simply press the on/off button once to turn on the device (this is the high speed); press again (this is the slow speed); press one more time and it turns the device off.    You want to start epilating by placing the epilator on your leg at a 90 degree angle with the on/off button pointing in the direction your are going to move the device. Hold the skin taught as you slowly move the device up your leg.........Okay here I go....OUCH! This is painful and you can actually feel the hair being pulled out by the root! First pass I was squinting my eyes in pain thinking \\&quot;really why torture yourself like this\\&quot;? Second pass, okay this seems to be getting a little more tolerable with the occasional pulls hurting more than others. About 2 minutes into it I have to say I did get use to the pain (a little). I found that it took me about 15-20 minutes to do one leg. After inspection the epilator did miss many hairs. I actually went back through with the lighted tweezers and started to pluck the missed hairs. Eeekkk my legs were super red and I was scared that it was not gonna go away! So I decided to wait a bit before proceeding onto my other leg. After about 45 minutes the rednessdid start to fade a lot so I finished the second leg.    Fast forward to a week later....    Wow! I am in total shock that my legs are still smooth (besides the little hairs the epilator missed and the hairs I missed plucking)! I normally use a reusable manual razor and have to shave every 2 days! This alone makes me want to continue to use the epilator as my new means to shaving. Even though I have yet to use the epilator on my underarms (I&#x27;m a scaredy cat) I am building up the courage to do so so I do not have to shave them every 2 days as well! As far as the bikini area...forget that, that is totally out of the question for me! Regular shaving in that area for me!    So in summary...    After a little bit of pain I would definitely recommend that you give the Philips Satin Perfect Epilator a try (only if you have some tolerance for pain).    I am planning on updating my blog when the hair on my legs does start to grow back since I have heard that epilation can cause ingrown hairs. A few I can deal with but if epilation gives me many ingrown hairs I may have to discontinue use even though I absolutely love not having to shave every 2 days! I will also give you an update when I use the epilator on my underarms (eeek)!</li>
            <li> I have had my Philips satin perfect epilator for a little longer than a month. I have had enough time to feel it out and get a better sense of how everything works, and here is my final review.&lt;br /&gt;The Philips satin perfect epilator is my new choice of hair removal. During my first use, the pain was horrible. After using it a third time, it is still painful, but my mind has blocked out the pain. If you stick through the first couple of painful sessions, then you will be rewarded with gorgeous smooth long lasting hairless legs!  But honestly, even when the hair does grow back, it grows back thin. I think that the thin regrowth alone deserves two thumbs up.&lt;br /&gt; The attachments get a three star rating from me, but they do not bring down the value of the epilator itself. The massaging attachments do little to numb the pain during the first epilating sessions. My initial review was rather optimistic about them, but once I put down my laptop and picked up the epilator, I came to term with the fact that epilating is and will always be painful.  I am still against the idea of using the epilator on my sensitive areas (bikini area and underarms), but my Philip satin perfect epilator has a shaving attachment for that.&lt;br /&gt;The shaving attachment was awesome--at first. It is a great attachment for those days that you are on the go and need something quick. The benefit of electrical shaving is the option to dry shave. However, after my second time using the shaving attachment, I realized that the blade has dulled down a bit. This surprised me very much because I do not have course hair. Although I feel that it takes approximately the same length of time to shave using a traditional razor as it does electrically, I would still recommend the Philips satin perfect epilator as a whole. There is a little pocket that disconnects from the shaving attachment that is supposed to catch the hair, but 2/3 of the hair always ends up outside of this little pocket. Again, not a deal breaker; I just pass a dry napkin or vacuum over the surface.&lt;br /&gt;The tweezers are still my favorite and I love to carry them around with me everywhere I go.  It has not dulled down a bit, which is a relief after discovering how quickly the shaving attachment dulled down. The lights on my tweezers and Phillips satin perfect epilator are still brightly lit. This is what I expected from Phillips, a long lasting, dependable product.&lt;br /&gt;Final thought :  I would definitely recommend this product to anyone who would be willing to put in the extra 5 minutes to epilate and in return receive longer lasting hairless legs.; I just pass a dry napkin or vacuum over the surface.&lt;br /&gt;The tweezers are still my favorite and I love to carry them around with me everywhere I go.

            <li> This product was very easy to use.  The two main heads were easy to put on, however, it took some getting used to in order to add the massage rollers.  The unit was charged for one hour and you get 40 minutes of shaving time.  After 10 minutes of use the shaver did not loose any power.  The added feature of a light on the shaver was extremely helpful because you could see what you missed.  Especially on the legs.  For under the arms, unless you are in front of a mirror, a light would not be as beneficial.  There is a set of tweezers that are included that contain a mirror and also a light.  Again, useful for seeing hairs that may be missed.  This is a unique feature that this shaver has.  It was very easy to clean as instructed.  The one click button to release the heads made it convenient to run the heads underneath water without wetting the shaver itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first Epilator machines got a really bad wrap because they all had this pulling sensation.  And many people stopped using them.  Although this one does incorporate the same technique of pulling the hair from the root, it does it with a lot more comfort and ease.  This one does pull the hairs with one particular head, but there are other attachments that will shave it like other shavers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The unit comes with a nice carrying case as well.  Overall the unit is stylish, easy to use, ergonomically designed.  One thing is the amount of noise that the shaver makes when turned on.  It is a little intimidating at first to hear the shaver on and see the shaver wheel grind.  You&#x27;ll know what I am talking about when you see it.  Other than that, it is a well designed and useful shaver.</li>
            <li> This thing is the biggest waist of money ever.. #1 it hurts.. a lot #2 it doesn&#x27;t even get 1/2 of the hair #3 it&#x27;s loud! Very loud Even the shaver attachment just &amp;#34;trims&amp;#34; it by no means leaves you smooth...</li>
            <li> I just got this for Christmas so I can&#x27;t speak yet to how it holds up over time, but so far I am pleased.  If you have never used an epilator before, then be forewarned- it can be painful!  But it seems to be doing a good job.  It also works pretty good as a shaver, so if you are unable to tolerate the epilator feature you can still use it as an electric shaver. So far it seems to hold a charge for a long time, about 45 minutes.  And I have to say, I love the illuminated tweezers! It&#x27;s a little pricey, but it does a good job so for me it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li> As expected it was painful on first usage. I tried it on my legs, I started using it while it was charging for the first time, convenient. I have done wax before. But this was more painful than wax. I did both legs up until little above knee in less than an hour. It pulls out majority of hair on first pass. I had used slower speed as recommended by few reviews. I had little red spots for about half an hour after I was done. I applied aloe vera gel as soon as I was done. The next morning I saw raised spots on my legs those  eventually went away in few hours. Overall this product is really nice in what it is supposed to do. I got smooth look. I liked results except for the pain part. After a week of this I tried again on legs since few hairs started showing, second time wasn&#x27;t that hurtful and was fast. I even went on and used it on underarms. I had waxed under arms a week ago and had few hairs growing which came out without any pain surprisingly. I have had this for a week, used it twice. My take on this is: first time use will hurt, but try to use it after you have had wax/shaved and have few hairs showed up. Then just maintain it every week or so depending on growth. I will update the review if my opinion changes.</li>
            <li> its a good Epilator but sometimes it is getting to hot when I&#x27;m using that and I couldn&#x27;t use that for 5 minutes. In addition it is very sharp and fast.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy it&lt;br /&gt;I bought one and it lasted a week then it stopped working and I returned it an I haven&#x27;t gotten my money back an it&#x27;s been two months.</li>
            <li> Great Epilator, but not for the faint at heart (imagine that goes for any Epilator).  If you can stand a little bit of pain and you&#x27;re motivated not to use razors anymore...then this is the Epilator for you.  It is noisy, not to the point I wouldn&#x27;t buy it (but don&#x27;t do it if your in the same room with someone watching TV or sleeping)!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once I started using it, after a few minutes I got used to the pain.  After a few days I used it again to get the hairs that weren&#x27;t long enough the first time and I have to say it&#x27;s awesome.  It&#x27;s been over a week since I used it and my legs are still smooth!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note - I see a few complaints about ingrown hairs...but thank God I am not experiencing this issue.  I made sure my legs were clean and after using I took a hot shower and lathered up my legs with lotion before going to bed.  Maybe this helped with any irritation issues?</li>
            <li> This is the first epilator I&#x27;ve ever used.  It was what I expected, it hurt, but nothing too bad.  I did notice it broke a lot of hair rather then pull it out.  I like how the head and the attachments come apart for cleaning.  I love that I can do this once on the weekend and be good for the week.  I&#x27;m working on building a tolerance to using this to remove bikini area hair, so I do a little each week.  It hurts, especially because I have thick hair.  Sometimes I notice that when the hear is removed, the hair follicle bleeds which is a bit scary. I&#x27;ll keep using it until it dies on me.  I haven&#x27;t pinched myself with it yet.  I&#x27;ve had my Phillips for about 2 months.  The next one I buy, I&#x27;ll make sure it does a better job of pulling the hair out rather then breaking it.  The hair breakage is my biggest complaint.</li>
            <li> I thought that after using, I wouldn&#x27;t have to shave for about 2-3 weeks and I find I have to shave every 3 or 4 days.  No different from a razor!</li>
            <li> Great product.  I thought it would hurt like crazy but outside of a bit of a sting, it is fantastic.  Plus, it lets you take off only what you want so you can leave a tiny bit of hair (like on the lower arms) just so it looks more natural.  Love it and would recommend it to a friend!</li>
            <li> It hurts me every time I try to use! It takes blood of my pubic region every time! It is waaay faster than my old cheap brand epilator but I don&#x27;t know if it is better! I can&#x27;t shave my armpit too, it gives me a burning feeling after using, like it took a skin layer off of my armpit! So for the armpit I still use my old one! It is great for legs tough, just because it is fast!</li>
            <li> Ok, I&#x27;m going to start off by saying I bought this on eBay because I could get it cheaper. It was by pure luck that I got it for the price I did because I had this one in my shopping cart, but I still want to review it because I have found my new love.&lt;br /&gt;I was tired of shaving...I have sensitive skin on my legs so I could only shave maybe once or twice a week, and my hair grows back very fast. This being so, it was almost like I never had smooth legs. Needless to say I hardly ever wear shorts, and I scraped my husband a lot while we were sleeping. I decided I needed an alternative. I tried waxing, and it was a complete mess, and it didn&#x27;t attach to all of the hairs. I didn&#x27;t want to pay to have it done because that could get expensive. I even tried making my own sugaring paste. While it did work at removing hair, it got sticky. Then as it warmed in my hand, it stuck to my leg and gave me a HUGE bruise when I tried pull it off. I tried products like Nair....didn&#x27;t even dissolve one hair, and it irritated my sensitive skin. By this point I was so frustrated, I started looking up laser hair removal. Come to find out, I am not a candidate for it because my leg hairs are red and blonde. Could my luck get any worse?! Then I found these things called epilators. They sounded like machines created by the devil himself, but I was willing to try it. After much research and youtube videos, this seemed like the best one. I ordered it. And as soon as it arrived, I tore into the box and charged it. I have read and heard that it can hurt like heck. But I have put my body through a lot already with tattoos, body piercings including my tongue, and child birth with no epidural, so I thought I could handle it. I put a washcloth in my mouth to bite down on just in case though :)&lt;br /&gt;I started on the bottom of my right leg, and yes, it did hurt some. It felt like when I was getting my tattoo or someone repeatedly flicking me with a rubberband but tolerable. My leg hairs were only able 1-1.5mm long. But when they were being pulled out, they were about 1/4in long, so I could tell that they were really being pulled out from the root instead of being broken off. I&#x27;m not saying that no hairs were broken off, some may have, but I saw a lot lf hairs that were pulled out. I started out using the efficiency head, but then moved to the head that lifts up the hairs. I actually think this one works best at cutting down the pain.&lt;br /&gt;This is a great machine, and I am greatful I found it. I love the different attachments, and the tweezers. The light on the epilator is a life saver especially on my blonde hairs that can be much harder to see.&lt;br /&gt;My legs had red bumps after epilation, but the bumps went away in about 30 minutes. The red spots stayed for about an hour or two, so it&#x27;s best to do this before bed. Another thing I like is that you can use this while it is charging (great option actually) just can&#x27;t get it wet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My advice for after epilation to help soothe your legs and help keep away ingrown and infected hairs is take about a quarter sized amount of grape seed oil with 3-4 drops of tea tree oil and rub it all over your legs. There is a very very minor burning sensation afterwards, but it only lasts like 2 minutes. It makes the redness go away faster as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FYI: my first epilation didn&#x27;t leave my legs silky smooth, but that might be from some hairs being way way too short. It is best to epilate everyday for a few day so that the shorter hairs have time to grow out. Then the epilator can grab them. Also if you have hair that grows in multiple directions like I do, going in small circles seems to help.&lt;br /&gt;Good luck!&lt;br /&gt;Any questions don&#x27;t hesitate to ask&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another FYI: I forgot to mention this the first time I posted my review.  I cannot stress enough how important exfoliating is. I recommend exfoliating before and after epilation. I do this by taking a shower/bath about an hour or two before I epilate. Then I wait till I&#x27;m about ready to go to bed, and then I usually run a quick bath just to exfoliate. This second bath is only in like a few inches of water and takes only a few minutes.</li>
            <li> This is first epilator I have purchased and it will be the last as well. I get a smoother effect using a razor than I do using this device of torture. Also the epilator only catches hairs of a certain length, so if you use just an epilator you will constantly have stubble. I find that I have to use the epilator once a week to keep the hair at bay. Another thing is the epilator makes my legs all bumpy for days afterwards. Even my boyfriend noticed this. Not attractive to have bumpy legs. And satin is not bumpy. I used this product regularly for a month to give it a fair shake and I am not impressed.</li>
            <li> I will update this review as I continue to use this product but after the first use on various body parts:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve never used an epilator before, but I&#x27;ve heard they can be painful.  This one is too...don&#x27;t fool yourself into thinking it won&#x27;t be.  Ultimately it&#x27;s still pulling out the hair.  Ironically enough however, I found that longer hair (1/4 of an inch to 1/2 in) on the bikini area and a few other areas hurt a whole lot less than hair on my legs shaved a few days ago that was much shorter.  It was so painful on my legs I couldn&#x27;t use it for more than a few seconds at a time.  In other areas I pulled through.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, that aside, I do like the product overall and even if the epilator function isn&#x27;t a first choice over the old Shick Pro Glide, a lot of the other features are nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many attachments.  There are two main heads - the epilator and a shaver.  You can also surround the epilator with various massage heads.  I have to admit the massage heads seemed like they&#x27;d feel nice, but really they do nothing to ease the epilator for me.  They do however help guide the head (the roller one anyway) so you can get smoother more controlled motions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The real gem here is the shaver though.  My boyfriend has a Panasonic shaver (for men) with a very nice head...this is smaller but fairly comparable in function.  It takes more passes over a hairy area than his does (we compared) but it also has smaller holes and less overall surface area.  With its nice edge comb and all though I found this a FANTASTIC shaver...an worked on the legs just great!  I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;d use it all the time, but with the really bright light and ability to shave dry, I could really see the usefulness for when one needs a quick clean up on the legs or pits but doesn&#x27;t have time to properly hop in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1) Luxury tweezer.  It&#x27;s ridiculous I know, but I love the tweezer.  It&#x27;s in a little lipstick like tube and has a super bright LED for plucking.  As much as I&#x27;d like to reserve it for eyebrows, the sucker is a great tweezer and just seems so darn useful I might keep it in my purse for general use (hey, LED flashlight!)&lt;br /&gt;2) Bright light on the shaver/epilator.  At first I thought this was ridiculous, but really wow it&#x27;s nice!  You see so many hairs that would get easily overlooked otherwise.&lt;br /&gt;3) Power.  It&#x27;s quite powerful and has two speeds.  More than enough power on the epilator for sure and the shaver seems pretty decent too.&lt;br /&gt;4) Locking feature.  There is a way to \\&quot;lock\\&quot; the shaver so you don&#x27;t accidentally turn it on when storing it.&lt;br /&gt;5) Can use while charging.&lt;br /&gt;6) Plug in adapter is very tight...at least it won&#x27;t fall out by accident.&lt;br /&gt;7) Look.  Really the whole thing just looks nice.  It feels expensive...and very female oriented frankly with all the smooth lines, white and flowers.&lt;br /&gt;8) Two year warranty and 45 day return policy.  Nice if you paid for it and weren&#x27;t sure if you&#x27;d like it or if you are concerned about it breaking or wearing out.&lt;br /&gt;9) Shaver vs. epilator option.  Even though I&#x27;m most likely to use this as a shaver, I like that the epilator is an option.  As much as it pulls hair out my understanding is that epilation lasts a lot longer like waxing.  It is indeed much smoother I can attest.  Not sure I&#x27;ll ever be able to use it on my legs though...I will try it again some time when I have longer hair on my legs and see if that helps or makes it worse. (See edit...longer hair is worse)&lt;br /&gt;10)  Smooth...I&#x27;ll admit that in an area where you can stand to use it, the epilator does a fantastic job of leaving behind a very smooth surface...nearly as good as waxing.  Just slower.&lt;br /&gt;11) Easy to use.  Other than the obnoxious instruction sheet (discussed in Cons) it was pretty intuitive.  You can figure it out yourself very easily.&lt;br /&gt;12) Very understandable charging indicators.  Blinks brightly while charging, turns off when done (well actually turns solid and then turns off after a while, but unless you&#x27;re watching it like a hawk...)&lt;br /&gt;13) Seems very safe.  I got confidence with it quickly and even though I didn&#x27;t go out of my way to try cut myself, it seems very unlikely to injure you even when you&#x27;re pressing hard or at angles (on the shaver).  The same is true of the epilator really...it never seemed to present any danger other than yanking out hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;1) Not waterproof or safe to use in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;2) Ridiculous amount of instructions.  For something that seems like it should be so simple, the instruction sheet is huge and confusing.  There are 32 pictures to refer to and numerous steps.  I skimmed most of it, but kept having to try look things up to make sure I was doing it right which was hard.  It&#x27;s not even a booklet.  It&#x27;s a fold out...the kind that never fold back as nice as they were before you unfolded it like an unruly old style map.&lt;br /&gt;3) Can pop the head off while it&#x27;s in use.  The head comes off with a release on the side.  Unfortunately if you hit this while it&#x27;s running, the head comes off anyway and makes a partial connection.  I don&#x27;t know if you can damage the shaver this way but it seems like a real possibility.&lt;br /&gt;4) Pain.  Up to you...if you get used to it, I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s not so bad, but seriously, ow!  It feels like an electric shock...that keeps shocking you until all the hair is gone.&lt;br /&gt;5) Kinda messy...I admit seeing all the gross little hairs on the head and around where I was experimenting was unappealing.  Shaving in the shower negates all that mess.&lt;br /&gt;6) Not very fast.  Honestly, a regular razor is faster even if you can&#x27;t (or shouldn&#x27;t) use it dry.&lt;br /&gt;7) Tweezer batteries.  As much as I like the tweezer I don&#x27;t have anything else that uses coin cells that size.  When it runs down it will be obnoxious to replace them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;End verdict...I&#x27;ll keep trying it and updating this review...I would probably never use the epilator on the pits but it&#x27;s good on other areas you want super smooth.  However, for an electric razor I&#x27;m very satisfied.  Short of one that could be used in the shower like my boyfriend&#x27;s the shaver portion is pretty much exactly what I was thinking of looking for at some point.  As to whether I&#x27;ll prefer it over the Shick in the end, I&#x27;m still on the fence.  The tweezer sure is nice though. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  No, longer hair doesn&#x27;t help at all.  It&#x27;s worse.  Hot shower beforehand doesn&#x27;t help either.  Ice packing does though...numbs it out.  It closes pores so it probably does more damage, but it also makes the hair stand up so whatever.  Seriously though...this hurts.  It hurts worse than getting a tattoo.  However, I&#x27;ve been trying to hold out...it might be getting better.  There are people who epilate all the time so I imagine you develop a tolerance.  What would be useful would be to know how to compares to other epilator options.  In the meantime, I&#x27;m going to leave my rating as is...the rest (shaver, tweezer, etc) is very nice, I still like it as a shaver and will keep trying the epilator a few more times...I have yet to manage to completely sit through an entire leg session, but we&#x27;ll see...what I have done with it looks very nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: if you want it as an epilator you need to read other reviews that compare it to other epilators.  Having only used this one, all I can say is this one is super nice in every way except that it hurts like crazy.wk...)  13) Seems very safe.

            <li> I love it. I have baby fine hair, so I don&#x27;t have any pain. It just feels like my skin is being lightly scratched. It hurts less than waxing. Some hairs break off instead of being pulled out, but it is OK.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a replacement for an older model phillips, love it so far.  Light is actually more helpful than I expected.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fast and really removes your hair! It doesn&#x27;t hurt at all after the first time. There is no need to wax, shave, or use hair removal creams ever again!</li>
            <li> I had used an epilator years ago and had gotten ingrown hairs on my legs. I have used my Philips Satin Perfect Deluxe Epilator a few times and have had perfect results. I love it.</li>
            <li> I expected a bit better performance from it - when it goes out, I think I will get Braun again (switched after my old one stopped working to see which performs better), when this one fails.</li>
            <li> First ever epilator and I love it! It&#x27;s quiet, does a great job lifting even the smallest hairs and the best part is it&#x27;s portable.</li>
            <li> At first I was very satisfied.  But only after 2 uses it stopped working. There is nothing wrong with charger so I presume it has to be the epilator itself. Unfortunately there is no return policy. I just wish I could have it replaced.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually post reviews, but all the reviews that I read helped me decide I&#x27;d risk it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought it was going to be like the old Epilady torture device of the 90&#x27;s.  Let me say - WOW was I wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been waxing off and on for a few years and just didn&#x27;t want to shave again after a good 3 months of waxing.  My hair is not really all over anymore, but there&#x27;s enough that I have to do something about it.  I didn&#x27;t have time to get waxing done and it is finally shorts season so I took the plunge.  Oddly enough, this was a recommendation while shopping on Amazon for my wax strips. (Point for Amazon marketing dept.)  My hairs were all about 1/2&amp;#34; - so really long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I couldn&#x27;t wait for it to charge so I called my best friend and said &amp;#34;here I go!&amp;#34;  She was waiting for the yelps and owwwww&#x27;s and none came.  I didn&#x27;t even cuss.  I managed to do my full legs in about an hour from big toe to 1&amp;#34; away from my bikini line with only a few winces on my inner thighs, I think.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did use the hair raiser head attachment, but I don&#x27;t know if it did anything extra cause it really didn&#x27;t hurt much at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it for my chin and upper lip this morning - upper lip always breaks out when I wax - ALWAYS.  We&#x27;ll see how this goes.  It did hurt a little on my upper lip but even waxing hurts a lot there for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am very happy after just 2 days and I wish I would have done this years ago!</li>
            <li> Because of previous reviews, I took two Tylenol capsules for the pain...Glad I did, it did sting on my legs and arms.  I used it about 3 weeks ago and I have yet to see or feel any hair growth.  I will say that it did leave a little bit of stubble on my legs, but it wasn&#x27;t a big deal to me.  I just shaved the stubble off.  I also used it on my face and again the stinging was annoying and there was a little bit of pain, but nothing I couldn&#x27;t handle.  Oh, it is loud!.  I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because of the stubble and the noise level.  Over all, GREAT PRODUCT!!! :)</li>
            <li> I like it very much. It is very comfortable.</li>
            <li> Works great- my first epilator. It hurts at first but you get used to it quickly. More convenient than waxing with all the positive effects!</li>
            <li> Good product...but makes lot of noise.....</li>
            <li> It is painless, works quickly, don&#x27;t have to fight with a cord. Would recomment to friends and family. Very Pleased</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t meet my expectations as I&#x27;ve used it only for two weeks.and now it doesn&#x27;t work.:-(so I&#x27;m quite disappointed:-(</li>
            <li> I usually wax every 3 weeks but had always thought of using an epilator, but was worried about the pain. After receiving this through Buzzagent.com, I was really exited to use this. You have to charge it for an hour, and then you&#x27;re off. It is uncomfortable. More than waxing, but if you hold the skin taunt, it lessens the discomfort and if you move continuously, you get used to the pain. Like a tattoo. BUT, it takes the hair off easily and effectively! Plus it&#x27;s faster and more convenient than waxing. I&#x27;m in love! Here are a few tips to maximize your experience:  Exfoliate, exfoliate, exfoliate! This prevents ingrown hairs.  Use after a hot shower to open the pores and minimize irritation.  Use an alcohol free lotion or antiseptic after using to soothe skin.  A bunch of attachments come with this amazing tool plus some fabulous tweezers. All of which I have yet to try, but I&#x27;m sure are equally awesome.  I think I will never go back to waxing again after receiving this little gem!</li>
            <li> What it does, it does well: removes hair from the folicle level very well. It is fast, doesn&#x27;t require more than one pass (depending on amount of hair of course)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does it hurt? Yep, especially the first use. It gets much, much more tolerable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What it is not: it is not a razor, if you are looking for a razor like shave this is not it. It is not like waxing, waxing gets it all. This epilator will leave behind the very fine and shorter hairs, you know they are there to the touch, but not at all visible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How I&#x27;ve used: for about 2 months. I don&#x27;t typically shave at all, so I put this puppy to task. Used on under arms and legs. One day. At. A. Time. It hurt. Now I use it about once a week to catch any hairs that it can. I follow up with a no alcohol moisture and all the redness seems to stay at bay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Did a lot of research before this purchase as it was one of the more expensive, Im very pleased results, were just as expected.</li>
            <li> It works really well. I can hardly feel it removing hairs and I like the added feature of the light because it makes it easier to see hairs that I&#x27;ve missed.</li>
            <li> Disclaimer: I received this product free from BzzAgent to test and give my honest opinions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been epilating my legs for approximately 10 years now, and have used various cheap and expensive epilators.  This one is my favorite!  But before I get into the review, let me tell you The Secret of Epilating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What&#x27;s the secret?  Well, first, you need to choose a less sensitive area for your first epilating experiences.  I suggest lower legs.  After you get used to epilation there, you can move on to other areas if you wish.  Now, here&#x27;s the secret.  The key to success...wax first!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know, you&#x27;re thinking, \\&quot;Wax!  Whaaaat!  I&#x27;m using an epilator so I don&#x27;t have to wax or shave or do anything else!\\&quot;  Trust me.  The amount of pain that an epilator will cause you is directly related to how many hairs it&#x27;s yanking out.  That goes for this epilator or any other epilator.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, get those lower legs waxed.  You can go to a professional, which I recommend if you&#x27;ve never had waxing experience, or you can do it yourself with the home kits.  You only need to do it this one time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay, so you&#x27;ve had your legs waxed.  It hurt some, or a lot.  You got through it.  Now, enjoy those smooth legs for a week or two.  After a week or two, you&#x27;ll notice some short hairs starting to poke out and ruin that wonderful smooth leg experience.  This is the time to epilate.  Since there are only a few hairs getting yanked out, the pain will be bearable, and it won&#x27;t take much time to do.  After the initial epilation, you&#x27;ll continue doing it every week or two in order to keep stubble at bay and keep the epilation relatively painless.  Easy!  If you get lazy and let the hair grow for weeks, you will notice that the pain gets worse.  If, like me, you sometimes get super lazy in the winter and ignore your legs for months, there is always the option of starting over with the initial waxing cycle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now you know the secret to epilation.  So what&#x27;s great about this epilator?  Because, let&#x27;s face it, this thing is expensive.  (There is a similar, cheaper, model which doesn&#x27;t include the electric razor attachment, which I will mention later.)  Well, like I said, I have used various epilators over the years.  This one seems to cause me the least amount of pain, but even more importantly, the fewest ingrown hairs.  When epilating (with any epilator) there is always the chance that a hair, instead of being pulled out completely, will break off at the surface of the skin or just underneath.  This, for me, can lead to ingrown hairs.  This Satin Perfect Epilator, however it&#x27;s different than others, (maybe the fact that the discs are ceramic instead of metal?) has not been causing that problem in the month and a half I&#x27;ve been using it.  That aspect alone is well worth the price difference for me.  If my house burned down or someone stole my epilator, I&#x27;d suck it up and pay to get another Satin Perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cordless aspect is my other favorite thing about this epilator.  It charges quickly and the charge lasts through several epilation cycles.  You can use it anywhere (as long as it&#x27;s dry; this is not for in-shower use) and you are not tied to a power outlet.  However, if you need to epilate and the device is not charged, you can use it while it&#x27;s plugged in and charging.  Very convenient!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The epilator head comes with two attachments you can add on.  One is intended to massage/stretch the skin to make epilation easier; the other is intended to pull hairs up to make it easier for the epilator to catch them and pull them out.  I tried them out and for me, they made the process less painful, but it took a little longer than normal.  If you&#x27;re new to epilation, I suggest trying them.  If you&#x27;re a veteran epilator, they are probably not necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition to the epilator head, this device comes with an electric razor head.  The cheaper, non-deluxe version does not include this.  I think it&#x27;s pretty neat that you can use the device for both shaving and epilating.  So this is not only a cordless epilator, it&#x27;s also a cordless electric razor.  Again, remember you are not supposed to be using this in the shower.  The razor head worked well for me.  I used it for shaving my upper legs and armpits--even though I&#x27;ve epilated for years, those areas are too sensitive for me to epilate.  While the shave it gave was probably not as close as what I&#x27;d get with a disposable razor, my skin was less irritated.  The shaver head also comes with a trimmer guard attachment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is an expensive personal grooming device, but it is well worth it.  A good epilator will last you for years.  You&#x27;ll save money on razors and shaving cream, and you won&#x27;t be creating waste from disposable razors or blades.  Your legs will be a lot smoother, and you&#x27;ll spend less time on hair removal.  As I said earlier, I did receive this product for free, but I would gladly pay to replace it if necessary.</li>
            <li> Bought it a few years ago, and I still love it.</li>
            <li> At the time of review, this product is about $150. While it may not seem like much for some (or a lot for others), I think you should base whether or not you should buy this product based on your own tolerance level with pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is essentially a bunch of tiny tweezers that when pressed down on your skin will grab at one of your hairs and pull the root out. If you have ever tweezed your eyebrows, IT IS THE EXACT SAME FEELING! now imagine that pain and feeling constantly while you are using this product. That it was an epilator feels like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have waxed your entire life, this pain may not be that unbearable, but if you are primarily a shaving type of girl like me, boy does it hurt!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are 2 speeds:&lt;br /&gt;1 speed - super fast - for areas with lots of hair such as legs&lt;br /&gt;2 speed - moderate - for this sparse areas like your arms&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your hair will be removed and you will see all the roots. The hair that grows back will grow back at the same speed as waxing does (since they both pull) and your hair will grow slower and thinner. From other girls who have used this products, they told me that the more you use it, the more you get used to. It took me a LONG time to do my legs, but once you get used to doing it, it should take 20 minutes and its done every 3-4 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note that epilating CAN create lots of ingrown hairs, so if you are prone to ingrown hairs, you must scrub before you use this product, and you must daily perform a body scrub so that you can remove ingrown hairs. the problem should ease up as the hair becomes thinner and sparser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the epilator comes in its own little vanity bag where you can place the chargers, and its heads. it has one head for shaving, for the time when the pain becomes too much and you just want to shave as well as messaging heads. A full charge should give you 40 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this product comes with a 2 year warranty.</li>
            <li> For years I used a Braun. I&#x27;m now glad I misplaced it and had to buy another epilator. I love this one. The light is so incredibly helpful. The discs are able to grab shorter hairs. I have no complaints (yet).</li>
            <li> This product worked great for a few weeks. If it would have lasted for at least a year i would have written a positive review. Iv used many Epilators before and this was was goid while it last d bit actually took off the finnest hairs. However it stoped working after a few weeks. It just stopped charging. What a shame.</li>
            <li> I really like this.  I had one that was a good 10 years old and was surprised that the new one worked much easier and much less pain.</li>
            <li> This product was good only for the first weeks. It does not remove anything anymore (and I bought it 4 months ago). Save your money, buy another brand!</li>
            <li> Absolutely not worth the money. The simplest braun epilator I had did its job much better. Decided to try something more fancy but regretted it, for some reason it doesn&#x27;t come close enough and leaves all the roots. So even just after using it legs still felt not very smooth.&lt;br /&gt;Didn&#x27;t think for a moment about keeping it.</li>
            <li> This is my second epilator.  A tip to start: if you&#x27;ve never epilated before, don&#x27;t start.  Ingrown hairs are a real issue once you do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Talking about just the epilator though, this one works better than my first one (emjoi caress or something like that.)  Grabs the shorter hairs.  When the battery dies, it doesn&#x27;t do it gradually like my old one, it&#x27;ll just stop altogether.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaver attachment is pretty nifty.  The other attachments...I&#x27;m not really sure what the point of them are.  I tried them and they seemed pretty useless.</li>
            <li> I used to use epilators with metal tweezers. When my last one started to slow down, I did some reading and found this one with ceramic tweezers. It works a lot better, pulls really small hairs and is easy to clean. I really like this epilator and I am glad I tried it! Another important thing for me was the ability to use it while it is plugged in. Many epilators out there do not work while plugged in.</li>
            <li> Im fascinated with this products. It&#x27;s worth every penny. I a very hairy woman. My hairs are thick and darks even before my first shave there were really dark, that all the students in the school make fun of me. My legs looked like mens legs and i was tired to tears. But shave doesn&#x27;t solve the problem. It give me severe rash and white spots and in the top of that, my legs were really itchy wen a showered. I know this is embarrassing, din&#x27;t shave for a month to get them waxes in the spa, but even they make fun of me. I  was humiliated. Then tried wax strip to make it myself but din&#x27;t work. So i stick with the pants always. Shaved my legs one time every other week to show my legs one day because of the fast grow of my hair. I began to look for new ways on internet, and thanks to God! I found this product. I&#x27;m so glad that din&#x27;t care the pain. More painful were the itch, and the people comments. Thanks Philips for this amazing Epilator.</li>
            <li> I really need one! I read the reviews and most of them were positive, I decided to get one, and I just SO GRAEAT. Definitely worth buying!</li>
            <li> Bought this as a replacement to a different manufacturer/model after reading many of the reviews.  Immediately loved the difference of these disks versus the &amp;#34;tweezer&amp;#34; style of my old one.  The &amp;#34;pain&amp;#34; level is tons lower with this-to the point I might brave trying areas other than my legs.  I have had it for a bit now, and was kind of thinking maybe it is not working as well as when I first got it, but I actually think it is because the hair is coming back thinner when it does come back.  Have never caught skin, and have not had any ingrown hairs-but I do follow exfoliating big time as it makes a difference regardless of epilator IMHO.  The only reason I know it is missing some hairs is because of the super bright light.  Can get most even now with an extra pass or a circle motion, but honestly those missed you can&#x27;t see but you might feel them.  If it&#x27;s buggin me that day I might drag a razor over to catch these few next shower, but if I don&#x27;t bother nobody knows but me.  The fact you can use this with the cord, which is super long, is wonderful!  I also think it is way quieter than my other one.  Charges quickly.  Warning light when battery is getting low comes on before you lose any power so to speak.  I&#x27;ve been epilating for a while, so I went right for the direct hit without using any of the other accessories and again, would call it almost painless.  Tried the massaging attachment and could not feel it at all.  Comfortable design, clean look.  Nice storage bag holds everything including the long cord.  My previous model had come with a freezer glove so you could kind of numb the area before you epilated.  I did use it when I first started out and gradually became comfortable enough not using it.  I would say had I started with this model I don&#x27;t think the glove would have even been necessary - but if you are sensitive to pain or just starting out try using covered ice packs or frozen wash cloths until you get used to things.  It&#x27;s i little pricey, but you will get more than your moneys worth with this.  Highly recommend!!ey, but you will get more than your moneys worth with this.  Highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always used Epilator but mine was getting really old so I started looking for a new one. I went through many options and after reading the reviews I chose this one. I am very happy about my choice, it does the job!!!</li>
            <li> I love this epilator!  I hesitated to purchase it because I was under the impression that epilators were painful.  This arrived yesterday and I screwed up my courage to use it today:  Wow!  It wasn&#x27;t painful at all and did a marvelous job of removing hair.  I would not hesitate to recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> Worked as advertised!</li>
            <li> my wife is Brazilian and she had one this maybe not the same but one that works just like this one, so any way she is in love with it, it does what is meat to do, without too much trouble, no need to read a manual, you can use while is charging.</li>
            <li> I was very happy with this product at first. It was a huge improvement over the cheaper epilator (Bliss spa) that I owned before. However, after three months it inexplicably stopped working. I just went to use it one day and it would not turn on and it would not charge. I am very disappointed that a product of this price would stop working so soon.</li>
            <li> All I know is that it hurts and it works good, according to my wife, and she loves the tweezers with the light.</li>
            <li> This was my first time purchasing an epilator, and I wasn&#x27;t completely settled on buying this one. Although this epilator did receive a lot of good reviews, some of the recent reviews made me think twice about spending more than $50 dollars on this product. However, I&#x27;m glad I did. This epilator works really well. After my first time epilating, my legs have been mostly stubble-free (my leg hair are really fine, so a few strands were cut instead of pulled out). After the second or third time epilating, my legs were completely stubble-free. I would definitely recommend this to my friends and family.</li>
            <li> Did not work at all for me. The results are more like shaving, not epilating.</li>
            <li> This epilator really doesn&#x27;t work well. I bought it because the Emjois seem to break after a couple of years and was hoping that a Philips would be a better quality product. But this one only seems to work if hairs are a particular texture/length, and either ignores or breaks the others. I&#x27;ve gone back over hairs that the Philips would not pick up with my old broken Emjoi and it picks up all the hairs that the Philips left behind (in between jamming/turning itself off every few seconds). I&#x27;m going to have to go back to Emjoi with the understanding that although they don&#x27;t last, at least they work well for a little while!</li>
            <li> This epilator does what it&#x27;s supposed to. It is my first epilator purchase, so there has been a trial and error period in my learning curve. Proper exfoliation and post treatment (I occasionally use PFB vanish) make a huge difference and help prevent ingrown hairs. I&#x27;ve found that I can really only use it for my legs, but it&#x27;s still worth it to me. The epilator itself is very pretty, and the attachments all have a use. My only complaint is that the battery doesn&#x27;t last very long. Around the end of a second use, the power starts to noticeably weaken.</li>
            <li> great transaction. Product as described</li>
            <li> Heed the advice of a previous member. It works amazingly and doesn&#x27;t hurt as much a s you might expect -if - you are following up on an initial waxing. From scratch, you will feel it.</li>
            <li> Ouch. Hurts like heck and missed so many hairs! I used it once and won&#x27;t ever use it again. Ever.</li>
            <li> Okay so, here we go this is worth every penny you spend. but BE PREPARED FOR PAIN!!!! OMG i have a very very high tolerance for pain but it was torture lol...if you can stand it then i would recommend it. But also i love the shaver attachment if you cant deal with the pain like me on my upper thighs and arms you can just buzz it right off, and it looks and feels great. now i just use the shaver ever couple of days and 5 mins later i&#x27;m stubble free. it comes with a lot of attachments and a cool lighted tweeter and mirror compact. it holds a good charge for about 40-50 mins. comes in a white pouch where you can keep all the attachments. fully charges in about 20 mins. nice to carry around in your purse for last min touch ups.</li>
            <li> I love the epilator mechanism (it is less painful than my last one), as well as the light the bonus heads are really nice as well. The shaving attachment works really well, it is a huge benefit to have the trimming option. The clean up is so easy, and it makes me feel better about being sanitary. I would recommend this product to anyone who hates shaving, and just wants a &amp;#34;one and done&amp;#34; effect (for a few weeks at least) :o)</li>
            <li> I really like this hair remover machine, it&#x27;s a little pricey but it works very well. I just have to see with time how long it lasts ...</li>
            <li> Really great device! Very fast &amp; effective. Of course painful a bit, but bearable - you just get used to it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used epilation for years &amp; just needed a new one.&lt;br /&gt;The epilator works great &amp; so does the shaving head.  The fast charge time &amp; the length it holds the charge are wonderful.  I like that it will work while plugged in if needed but with fast charge &amp; good hold time that may not be necessary.&lt;br /&gt;I truly appreciate the light!  I didn&#x27;t really think it woud help as much as it does.  It truly helps me see &amp; quickly pick up on the few stray hairs that get by.&lt;br /&gt;The lighted tweezers included with this deluxe set helped my husband quickly find &amp; remove a tiny metal splinter.&lt;br /&gt; Kudos to Philips for a great product!</li>
            <li> It is just awesome!!!&lt;br /&gt;We used it below the neck area and it was as per our expectations...&lt;br /&gt;I liked it..</li>
            <li> i live out of usa and i dont have opportunity to send product back. i always think twice. this product (Philips HP6576 Satin Perfect Deluxe Epilator, White/Champagne) i bought 1st time smth about 2 years ago. its cool. i used it all over. but its brocken (2 years is ok). i ordered the same one. ols friend is better... and! just 2 times. and it stops to charge.&lt;br /&gt;this is half of story.&lt;br /&gt;i ordered anothe one. used but in good condition. less then 2 times. ive used it less then 2 times. this time i even didnt charge it. so! im completly sure that it is &amp;#34;sickness&amp;#34; of this product. 2 years ago it was good. now - where are u doing it? in africa????? i want my money back. this is not Phillips cuality. or may be this is falsth. but!!! twice??? twice the same problem????? where is cuality control and supervising???&lt;br /&gt;im not other seller.&lt;br /&gt;im live person.&lt;br /&gt;contact me and i will confirm it.&lt;br /&gt;BUT DO NOW BUY THIS PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> Great! A little slow. No pain! I like the little light. It helps to see better the hair.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know  how to describe,sine several months ago I buy it, I only used it third times,when I used the fourth time I find it can not working.I used it very genteelly  as the instruction mentioned.I don&#x27;t know can I return it?Or can I have a free service to repair it?</li>
            <li> I like this item a lot! I won&#x27;t waste my time in shaving again!</li>
            <li> I have been using it for about a year. I can say, my previous epilator with metal plates did its job much better. This one is very pretty and good-looking, but breaks off the hairs.</li>
            <li> This is my second epilator after Braun Silkepil and I must say that Braun epilator is way much better then Phillips&#x27; one. I&#x27;m very disappointed with this epilator, because actually it doesn&#x27;t pull out the hair, but mostly splits the hair in the middle. Therefore I have to use it more often then usual.</li>
            <li> I use this about every 3 weeks only on my arm pits.  It hurts every time I use it but I still feel like the results are better than shaving. One of the attachments broke after one use, so be careful with them.</li>
            <li> Okay, So Yes, this is painful and there is no way around that. But have you waxed?  It&#x27;s no worse! And if you have waxed than you are familiar with the idea that you get use to this and you adjust.  And honestly for me,  I would much rather endure an hour of discomfort than have to shave every morning in the shower.  And if I am going to endure this kind of pain, than I want to do it as inexpensively as possible.  A few days before we purchased this my daughter paid out $50.00 per leg for a wax.  Which means with its second use this little gem has paid for itself!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You should be aware that this does not give you a perfectly smooth silky leg like a razor will, but unless you are rubbing your hands (or your sweetheart is) up your leg, you would not know your legs aren&#x27;t completely razor smooth.  They look completely smooth, and fantastic.  If I rub my hand up my leg even now (used the epilator yesterday) I can feel the occasional broken hair.  But no worries because I just let it grow out a few days and run this over a few little spots or two and I am perfectly maintained.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found it works best if the hair is only about an 1/8th of an inch long, it grabs just fine and is less apt to break the hair off.  If you hold it at the right angle (not hard, very comfortable) and move slowly it works fantastically.  If your hair has grown out a while the trimmer works great for getting to the right length before removing the hair.  The razor attachment is a nice addition, but honestly I haven&#x27;t had to use it much as the epilator head does a great job, so not a lot of touch up is needed.  It charges fast and easily holds enough charge to do its job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me and my daughters this is a great solution to wanting those non hairy legs and not having the time or desire to shave each morning or even every few days.  Saves time, money and my legs look great longer with very little effort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Summer and shorts here we come!</li>
            <li> I had had the same epilator for years and it worked great, that´s way I decided to buy the same one. However it´s definitely not as good as the previous one I had even if they are the same brand. Don´t know if it´s an error of my epilator only or it´s how all these epilators are, but red lights come up from it 5min after starting using it and the battery runs out really fast,it´s so frustrating!!</li>
            <li> I have been using this piece of crap for a few months now. Not once have the results been anything approaching satisfactory. I always have to follow up with tweezers or a razor; it simply leaves ~1mm of hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problem? It doesn&#x27;t so much &#x27;pull hair&#x27; as it does &#x27;grab it and break it off just above the surface.&#x27; Seriously, get an electric razor. The end results are essentially the same, except the razor will give much smoother results the first time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t waste your time or money. CVS sells a crappy one in-store for ~$40. It works at least as well as this garbage, for $70 less.</li>
            <li> The first use of a bit painful  Effect quite obvious</li>
            <li> it works and its not painful. i read a lot of people said its hurt but i didnt feel it . i guess they use it in the wrong way.</li>
            <li> I love the light. It is the best feature. It helps me do my underarms, bikini area and my legs.  Unless I am in direct sunlight I could never get all my hair because I couldn&#x27;t see them&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the porcelain blades that they aren&#x27;t metal. The speed is real good too.</li>
            <li> Deliverded in time. Works wonderfull, the best shaver I have owned so far. All the additionals are usefull. Ligth tweezer is great.</li>
            <li> Ok, I bought this epilator because my old one needs to be replaced and of course this one ha so many features; well, it&#x27;s not truth; first of all battery is enough for less then 5-10 minutes and when it&#x27;s charging it does not work. It does not remove hair well so it takes some time to remove them completely; I wish I could return it but unfortunately it&#x27;s not possible. So just keep in mind if after charging it does not work as sellers promised just makes sense to get money back. It removes hair painfully just like other cheap epilators do.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this epilator but it was way to painful with even taking a Advil I was covered in ingrown hairs I hope I can find a better product!</li>
            <li> works well. painful on legs. have not tried in other areas.</li>
            <li> I purshased this epilator as a replacement for my old one. It&#x27;s easy to use, the battery autonomy is better than the previous model and it&#x27;s almost painless (I&#x27;m already used to it so I don&#x27;t feel the pain anymore). The ceramic discs are way better than the metal ones, I tried both and couldn&#x27;t support the epilator with metal. So if you are lookin g for an epilator, this one is a great choice.</li>
            <li> Better than I expected.</li>
            <li> I will be sending this back.  It does not do the job I was expecting at all.  It&#x27;s very weak.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent machine. It is comfortable to the grip and also not too heavy so your hand won&#x27;t get tired quickly.  It is extremely accurate and the incorporated light is great help. The accessories that come with it are really useful.</li>
            <li> Wonderful results! I had used an epilator years ago and while it was effective it did not perform like the Phillips. True, there is still a little sting (emphasis on little) but the results last a week or more! Great product!</li>
            <li> Philips Satin Perfect  works great !  It&#x27;s much better than wax or shaving and save $$$.  I use it other every week to make sure all the hair out .</li>
            <li> May not have to do an epilator as often but took more total time than a quick shave with a razor every day.  Takes pass after pass to get most of the hair so not a quicker alternative to daily shaving.  Also will still be a few that it just won&#x27;t get and need to use tweezers.  Seemed to work better with a very light touch then firmly pressed against the skin.  Also created a problem with some ingrown hairs. Using tweezers doesn&#x27;t create that problem so not sure why the epilator does.  Stopped using it after a few months of trial.</li>
            <li> I loved it, it does hurt a bit, but I usually wax so it&#x27;s perfect for when I am in a hurry. There is no waxy mess and I don&#x27;t even have to plug it in to use it. It grabs all the hair</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about a month now. I find the &amp;#34;discomfort&amp;#34; level pretty ignorable on my arms and legs, but problematic on more sensitive areas like my belly. I still managed to use it with gritted teeth very slowly, but it wasn&#x27;t enjoyable - I actually think waxing would have been easier since you have a sudden very brief pain followed by nothing rather than a constant pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had some issues with ingrown hairs on my legs even though I&#x27;ve been trying to really scrub away dead skin. I&#x27;m not sure if I perhaps have has some issues with breaking instead of pulling some hairs causing this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall the epilator is well made and seems to function very well. The battery lasts quite well, it&#x27;s good for as long as I can go at it at a time and the charge indicator is well done. As some others note, the lighted tweezers that come with it are surprisingly useful and good even though it seems a bit like a gimmick at first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t tried the shaver head, I much prefer to use a blade razor.</li>
            <li> I bought this product about 3 weeks ago and I have used it twice and it is just absolutely amazing. While $100 may be overpriced I personally find that it was definitely worth the money. It charges great and the different heads are very easy to change. My favorite so far are the extra wide and the shaving head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FIRST TIME EPILATOR: Prior to buying this I had never used an epilator before, I have shaved for years and have always suffered from ingrown hairs. My hair is also very thick but this did the job. It&#x27;s very strong and very easy to use. I also not only used it on my legs but also under my armpits (which hurt a lot). It&#x27;s been 3 weeks though and my hair is already starting to come in so much thinner. I love this thing! I recommend it to anyone who is looking for an alternative to shaving. Especially this product because it works so well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The satin POUCH it comes in is really nice as well great for traveling and fits everything with ease. The TWEEZERS are also great not only because of the LED light but also because of the little lipstick tube it comes in that also has a little mirror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just make sure to clean after each use. The only real inconvenience I guess is the fact that it cant be used in the shower and the head comes off a bit occasionally but it&#x27;s not a major problem though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5/5 for ease of use and strength.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t remove all hairs and even it hurts so much. I think it doesn&#x27;t have a high quality. I will buy another epilator next time.</li>
            <li> Ouch it hurts so much, but it is worth, it takes 3 weeks for hair to grow! It is worth the pain. The features and attachments are really cool and the bag and tweezers  are really cool too :) Recommend it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s beautiful, comes with all the accessories and it works perfectly. It has super speed and light, and you can use it on your bathtub which is very convenient. really happy with my purchase!</li>
            <li> I really love this little machine.  I&#x27;ve braved using it quite a bit and I definitely want to reinforce to first time users that the pain is not that bad as you keep using it.  I&#x27;ve used it on legs, arms, bikini area, and underarms.  The first day using it on my underarms I could hardly put my arms at my sides, but now 1 month in I use the machine for &amp;#34;touchups&amp;#34; every few days or every week and it keeps any signs of hair at bay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You will have slight stubble, but it won&#x27;t be very noticeable, as you&#x27;re not cutting the hair like shaving, but rather producing &amp;#34;peach fuzz&amp;#34; between uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have more peach fuzz than you wish the day of something more important, the included razor is fantastic.  You will NOT cut yourself with this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This epilator will make your routine SO LOW MAINTENANCE! Suck it up the first few tries through the irritation - it won&#x27;t make you break out like veet and future sessions with it are much less irritating.</li>
            <li> Bought this at Bed Bath and Beyond because I coupon. I am impressed with this product for a couple reasons. You can use it with a cord or without and it holds a charge long enough to throughly finish both legs. Also, it really grabs the roots even the fine blonde hairs. With the finer hairs though you do need to let them grow in, the longer the better. But with the shorter course hairs,I was impressed at how little growth I needed to grab them by the root&#x27;s. I also like the guiding light on it. I only gave it 4 stars because I haven&#x27;t had it long enough to give it 5. This epilator seems like a solid product. If you want to  split hairs (no pun intended) The case is a bit flimsy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not going to lie, it&#x27;s an epilator and it&#x27;s yanking hair out down to the root so it&#x27;s not going to be pain free.  But, of the ones I have tried this one does the absolute best job of getting hairs the first pass through, pulling them out completely - not breaking them and doing it with the least pain possible.  It&#x27;s vibrates as you use it to help lift the hairs and the funny thing is I actually think it also help numb the skin because a few minutes in I hardly even feel the hairs being pulled anymore.  I&#x27;ve never had a bad experience - no pinching skin or anything.  It has worked well everywhere I have used it.  Easy to clean and a plug in recharger that charges fast.  The charge itself lasts a long time - I&#x27;ve used it for multiple sessions before having to recharge.</li>
            <li> Does what it&#x27;s supposed to.  Simple.  Just clean as instructed.</li>
            <li> I love this epilator!!! It is exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> I love it! I don&#x27;t have to grow out my hair on my legs to get it waxed anymore!!!! This literally keeps my legs super smooth for a good 3-4 weeks. Which was impossible before. I am amazed.</li>
            <li> A little pricey but worth-ed.&lt;br /&gt;the rechargeable battery is durable and the epilator is powerful.&lt;br /&gt;get everything done in much less time.&lt;br /&gt;the little battery sign blinks when u are running low so you can actually know a little bit in advance. But you can also use it hocked up to the power outlet.&lt;br /&gt;the built in light is most appreciated.&lt;br /&gt;Has a head to &amp;#34;epilate&amp;#34; and one to shave + a few other accessories you can find in the description of the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In terms of pain, well its an epilator, dont expect no pain! its depends on how much you can take pain and how much you are used to it. Its like waxing, it takes a little bit getting used to it!&lt;br /&gt;Of course no pain for the shaver head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i have owned a philips epilator for 12 years and is still working fine. i just wanted something with battery. more practical for vacation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product for someone who is looking for a good powerful and durable epilator.</li>
            <li> I love this epilator. It&#x27;s great how I can shave/trim too. I am very happy, it&#x27;s worth the money. I use it everywhere! :)</li>
            <li> I think this is one of the best purchases I have made. You will get used to the pain, which is not that much compared to other epilators I have tried in the past! Also, by being wireless, it makes it so much easier to use!</li>
            <li> I was reluctant to try this new way of shaving my legs.  I found it to be easier than expected and my legs felt smooth.  Very efficient machine!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this item for several months now. I originally purchased it for the epilator, but also liked the added electric razor/trimmer accessories. Unfortunately, the epilator only removes about 30% of the hair from my legs. I can not handle using it under the arm, it is just too painful. So, I have started just using it as a razor and bikini trimmer. If you want a good epilator I would not recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;Seems to stayed charge for extended amount of time and is fairly easy to clean. It has lots of accessory heads for the epilator and the trim attachment for the razor works great.</li>
            <li> I would love this product more if it got the super short hairs, really it&#x27;s stubble. It hurts like crazy the first 5 seconds but I kept going and seemed like my skin got numb. I did my legs and arms.</li>
            <li> This is the best Epilator! I tried other brands and models, but this one is really good! I saw many reviews with people complaining that it hurts a lot. C&#x27;mon guys, this is an epilator, of course it hurts! But this ceramic head makes it less painfull than other models. I recomend it!</li>
            <li> Very nice, beautiful, useful. In the beginning hurts a bit but the result is very good. Approved.  It’s worth it.</li>
            <li> Much better than the Braun epilator. The Braun only lasted about two years. Very difficult to clean. Hairs jam up the sides of the rotating bit. They&#x27;re impossible to clean.  The charge on the Braun does not last long enough to complete the job and it cannot be used while charging. The Philips is much easier to clean. It can be charged and used simultaneously. The head is wider so it grabs more hairs and gets the job done faster than any of three previous epilators I have owned.</li>
            <li> I use to wax, so either I don&#x27;t have any pain from this, or I just don&#x27;t notice it at all. The possible pain issue and the price were my only worries. With no pain, the price is worth it. It takes a few weeks to get all the hair removed due to difference in hair growth time, but still worth it. (Note: you DO need to exfoliate to reduce in-grown hairs, these also go away with time and exfoliating).</li>
            <li> My hairy beast of a husband - covered in hair from neck to toe - wanted to break this, but couldn&#x27;t.  He attempted to melt it in scalding water.  Threw it down a metal garbage chute.  Submerged it for just a bit.  This flimsy thing was like an old Timex...it kept on ticking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And, painfully removing all the corse, dark, well - rooted body hair one can imagine, lavishly flinging it on the bathroom floor, white root follicle, and all.  Strangely, I think it exfoliates / removes small &amp;#34;dry type&amp;#34; of clogged pores too, as I&#x27;ve seen evidence of micro pores ready to pop with just a bit of dried congestion, magically &amp;#34;sluff&amp;#34; off with this device, and a collection of dried / dead skin cell debris on the device itself.  Perhaps, it captures dead skin cells?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would use caution though, as I have caused several lacerations when forcing the blades close to the skin, to grab &amp;#34;just a couple more tiny hairs.&amp;#34;  A bad bleed too.</li>
            <li> It was my first epilator I ever used so I was a little scared. However after first epilation (the most painful time) I really like using Philips Hp6576. It removes my hair really good and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best epilator I&#x27;ve ever had!!! Easy to use and does a very good job. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I had high expectation for this new version, well it ends up with quite disappoitment. I bought the latest version and expec t time effecient and good effect, however, neither satisfies me. it cannot even compare to the HP 2844 versiion, which is more easier to use and cost me less time. Now I wonder how can I deal with it. Doesn&#x27;t worth the money.</li>
            <li> very noisy but really effective. I love the fact that I can use it cordless and that is very fast.</li>
            <li> Wife loves it, replaced an older model she had had for years.</li>
            <li> Really bad product,bought 2 and both stopped working in less than 3 months,for the price you&#x27;d  think it would last awhile,works good but just breaks on you so fast and for no good reason,am super pissed,wasted  200 bucks,will never buy any of their products,super unreliable,if I could I&#x27;d give a half star or worse .</li>
            <li> I was using an epilator for a different brand for a couple of years. It wasn&#x27;t the best one, and with the time and use wasn&#x27;t doing the job the way I wanted.&lt;br /&gt;A friend told me about this Phillips epilator and my husband ended up getting for me for Christmas.&lt;br /&gt;I used the first time a couple days a go, and I am in love with it, it&#x27;s awesome.&lt;br /&gt;I did not used all the tools, but the ones that I used I just loved.</li>
            <li> This epilator even grabs very short hairs and is just perfect since you don&#x27;t have to wait too long for the hair to grow out. I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so easy to use!!! and if you ever used one of this epilators before you will find this one no painful at all... i use it on my legs, bikini and underarms with no problem, is very fast, the light really helps and the cleaning is super easy. It comes with super cute tweezers with light in it to help you see the smallest hairs, perfect for eyebrows. It&#x27;s rechargeable so you can use it on battery and take it to the bathtub so you don&#x27;t make a hairy mess all over your bathroom floor. Not to use in the water, but in an empty bathtub it&#x27;s perfect.&lt;br /&gt;Love it!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good Epilator.&lt;br /&gt;The effect is much better that the cutter.&lt;br /&gt;Though it will cause a bit pain at the first time when using it.</li>
            <li> I like it because it is so quick and feels better.I&#x27;m fully satisfied. I thought it is number one! Thank you</li>
            <li> Oh this little baby makes my life so much better. I hate shaving. Don&#x27;t have the tolerance or &amp;#34;give a fu*&amp;#34; to wax. And honestly I don&#x27;t even really care for the epilator attachment to this. But for a women like me who&#x27;s hair is always growing, and the hair is THICK...being able to just buzz it off is priceless to me. I&#x27;ve had it for over a year now and still use it regularly.</li>
            <li> This works great to remove hair, but is PAINFUL.  If you don&#x27;t have a lot of hair, or it&#x27;s pretty fine this may work well for you.  If you have a regular amount of hair (like I do), this is just way too painful to practically use in large areas.</li>
            <li> Between all the epilators I went through the years, this is by far the absolute best. It can be used plugged in or not so you never have to stop half way and charge, the light really helps also. The attachments are nice. If you have never used an epilator before do not get this one, get a softer product because it does hurt. Its basically giant motorized tweezers, its loud, rough and painful but you never have to shave again or make appointments for waxing. You can use it at privacy and convenience of your home.</li>
            <li> Honest. I bought that model 8 years ago, Did broke from my mistake. Decided get  new one. I got Panasonic epilator..-worst mistake ever. After few days crying how bad was Panasonic, I bought that one.&lt;br /&gt;Im happy, depilating time takes twice less than other one, Im so nicely surprised about the light, and now my husband start to use it.....I just LOve it. Will recommend it to anyone.&lt;br /&gt;Its also fast, painless, two speeds, tweezers are so often set up.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace my Remington EP6025 epilator, which after a year started making terrible noises and would jam and lock up. I was pretty happy with the Remington until I bought this Philips HP6576. It is much quieter than my old model and i really like the light. I have terrible lighting in my bathroom, so the light is a plus. I also like that it can be used cordless or plugged into the wall. The battery doesnt last a full leg session for me, but I am rarely away from a plug in. I havent tried any of the other attachments yet. The Philips is about twice the price I paid for my first epilator, but I feel its twice the quality, so I didnt mind paying the extra. It just arrived yesterday (a day early in fact), so I have only used it once, but I am very happy with this purchase and would buy again.</li>
            <li> Really good epilator. It&#x27;s hurt though, if you are not get use with it or wax.</li>
            <li> My girls legs are smooth, love it!</li>
            <li> Does the job and does it well!&lt;br /&gt;I love the little light in it cause you can see the smaller hairs!&lt;br /&gt;There is no miracle women, IT DOES HURT! It&#x27;s pulling the hair OUT... seriously, how would it not hurt!&lt;br /&gt;I like epilators because I feel I&#x27;m in control of my pain, unlike going to get your body waxed!&lt;br /&gt;Anyways, I use this usually in my legs and bikini line. I do my own brazilian with it too!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Satinelle for the last 20 years and the basic model that cost $29 works 10x better than this one. As a matter of fact I just bought another one because my 20year old burned. The shaving on the other model is much better and smoother</li>
            <li> There is no such thing is no pain epilator. If you looking for one, buy a razor. When using epilator, you are plucking hair off/out of the skin, how can it not hurt??? Only after 15 years of using epilator it does not hurt my legs and armpits much, but it is extremely unpleasant. Bikini area will always be painful, but it does get better. With epilator the hair does not grow fast and in some places just stops growing altogether. Skin feels so nice and smooth for much longer than after razor. Epilator is not for everyone, but if you can stomach the pain, you do not have to waste money on many many razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Phillips is fantastic! I have had a different epilator for at least 10 years by the same company and it still works! Only because I wanted a brand spanking new one did I buy this epilator. It is a pretty color, great design in terms of the handle. I love the no cord feature - after charging it is enough for legs/bikini areas for about 5-8 times (of course it depends on the hairiness). The force/strength/power is the same when urged in or just charged, it is amazing! It is kind of loud, I have to up the volume on tv quite a bit to hear it over epilator, but at least I can do it with something on (unlike old epilator).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Phillips makes fantastic products! I love that in this one you can take the &amp;#34;head&amp;#34; off and actually wash it! There are at least four different &amp;#34;heads&amp;#34; and I choose the one that massages skin when epilating, love it! (Read instructions).</li>
            <li> I was really excited upon ordering this epilator. i had read many of the reviews. Unfortunately it wasn&#x27;t what I expected. First, the tweezer comes with a built in light, but mine didn&#x27;t work. Not sure if the battery it came with was dead or what not. The tweezer itself isn&#x27;t the best either, It doesnt grasp any of the hairs...I used the epilator on my legs and it really doesn&#x27;t work unless your hairs are a somewhat long. I really liked the effect on my underarm. It left it really smooth, it is somewhat painful but nothing too extreme.</li>
            <li> The most satisfactory epilator that I have ever found for a women, covering arms, legs, (not bikini) but just about all else!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product is all and more than it promises to be.&lt;br /&gt;Just be sure to generously moisturize that part of your body on which you have used it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is very comfortable, and the name states &amp;#34;for skin that is always smooth&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I have been using a different model from Philips for two years, but I got tired of sharing it with my teenager. I love everything about this model. I just wish the bag to carry all of the gadgets would be of better quality.</li>
            <li> Philips has designed a wonderful epilator with lots of accessories to make personal grooming easier and much more efficient.  It comes with a travel bag, and the light is really handy as well.</li>
            <li> Got this for the wife, she loves it for her legs, it does pluck so it&#x27;s not painless, but less so than a wax or tweezers and lasts longer than shaving.</li>
            <li> I like this epilator better than any one I have ever had.  It has the wider cutting area to get done quicker. It has a light to help you see the lighter hairs better.  Just a good sturdy product and does a great job.</li>
            <li> I was a little worried, after reading reviews about the pain level. I consider my pain tolerance to be pretty high, I&#x27;ve had multiple tatoos and did child birth without an epidural. With that being said there is no pain like that of a slow torturous epilation. I hate to admit, but I am quite a sissy about this. My first night of use with this product did not go so well. The first few pulls were about as painful as they come. And the fact that all you want to do is jerk your hand away from your own leg doesn&#x27;t help speed up the process. I managed to do a portion of one leg (it&#x27;s a slow process) because I had to give up in frustration. No tears though, so it must not have been that bad.&lt;br /&gt;Day two was easier, as I think I was more ready for the pain than anything. I spent a good hour or so finishing up some of the rough patches. The knees are the worst as my knees are boney. Keep in mind this is a LONG process, it&#x27;s not like the quick zip of a razor.&lt;br /&gt;Day three and I was finally able to finish most parts of both legs. I must say, after the initial swelling goes down (see my tips about swelling below) your legs really do feel smoother and look more satiny! My leg hair grows about has fast as my husbands 5&#x27;oclock shadow, so I was very excited about the ability to not have to shave my legs every morning (something I feel like I spend a greater part of my week doing).&lt;br /&gt;I have yet to use in this in the bikini area, call me a wimp I know, but I just haven&#x27;t quite worked up that nerve yet!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as swelling, yes there will be some. After first use your legs will look like little raised blotches of skin (where the hair was pulled out), but if you epilate at night before bed and immediately after epilating used a cool washrag to rub down your legs and then moisturize the swelling will be completely gone by morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve yet to see any bleeding while using this product and I haven&#x27;t yet gotten any skin pulled either. Upon first use I was pretty positive that instead of pulling hair it was pulling skin, but the nice thing about this product is when you pop off the top to clean it you can see all the little hairs in the bottom. This, at least, helped me believe that I wasn&#x27;t torturing myself for no reason.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The light is excellent in helping see in the darker areas and the directions are awesome. Be sure to follow them and when they say to hold the skin tight this isn&#x27;t because it makes it easier for the epilator to grab the hairs, actually it DOES help to reduce the pain. I found that the back of my legs was the least painful and the front top of my thighs was the worst.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tweezers are a bonus!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon has this product on sale right now, which was why I bought it and though it&#x27;s pricer than other epilators I always fully believe that you get what you PAY for.  I&#x27;ll probably have to continue to shave my knees as it was nearly impossible for me to get my entire knee done (dang boney knees) but I&#x27;ll take that any day!ng hair it was pulling skin, but the nice thing about this product is when you pop off the top to clean it you can see all the little hairs in the bottom.

            <li> This really amazed me. A friend let me try her older version, which she swore by... and while &amp;#34;uncomfortable&amp;#34; at first, it&#x27;s much more easy and bearable than plucking a full face of hairs here and there with tweezers each week at the minimum for me, which also hurts. This way, you can pluck out the hairs on your whole face anywhere there is hair.&lt;br /&gt;She did my face WEEKS ago, and I&#x27;m now just seeing some regrowth of hair. Usually, after I pluck, it&#x27;s just days before I already need to pluck again!! Darn those big black hairs on the chin and upper lip!!!!! I used mine to run over my chin when I felt a hair, and bingo, it was gone. My upper lip is still void of hair, and I&#x27;ve had to use tweezers to pluck one or two that pop up at the corner of my mouth. Again, at first, there is sort of an &amp;#34;ouch&amp;#34; factor, but, you get used to it and find it&#x27;s not that bad at all. Considering the good job it does. Best to use when you get out of the shower or use a warm rag to open the pores. I haven&#x27;t tried it on my legs yet, nor my armpits but I&#x27;m sorta excited to do it. Seems when I take a shower, I&#x27;m on my way someplace, and I&#x27;m always late. No time to sit and do my legs, but when I do, I&#x27;ll report back. It has several attachments, maybe read the details of the epilator for all it&#x27;s options. Hope this helps!!!</li>
            <li> superior to the silk epil i&#x27;d been using since 2000 until i tried this one last year. suggest if at all possible to use weekly - the longer the hair the more apt to have a prickly feeling but i can do behind the knee and underarms without a flinch. even use on my husbands back. Do not rinse the head while its attached tho - you&#x27;ll ruin it and have to go buy another one! Just pop the head off like the directions say and it rinses clean in seconds.</li>
            <li> Works good..at the beggining a little bit confused but im happy!</li>
            <li> Ow. Yes, the first time you use it, it hurts. A lot. But that&#x27;s pulling out years worth of growth. Once you get past the first (really ouch) time (wine helps a lot), if you use it regularly (I&#x27;m of the... um... hirsute variety so I use it every 3-4 days) it&#x27;s not bad at all. I wouldn&#x27;t even call it painful at this point because there&#x27;s so few hairs being pulled out. MUCH easier than shaving, can do it on the couch while bored watching tv, and it leaves your skin smooth. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This thing is a life saver</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not worth the money.  It didn&#x27;t really pull my leg hair and caused my skin irritate so bad.  I do not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This works quite well, charges very quickly, and can be used cordless or when plugged in.  Because it also has a shaver head, it can not only be used as such, but can also shave hair to a length which the epilator can most reliably remove.  Best of all, for me, is that the ceramic head means that I can use this, despite having a metal allergy.  Don&#x27;t expect to use it on your face, however, as the facial hair removal touted is for the very nice, lighted tweezers included in the set.  It isn&#x27;t painless, but using it is much less uncomfortable than epilating with the original EpiLady.</li>
            <li> I am still trying to figure out how everything works with this product. Could have come with much more insurrections. But I am confident in time I will figure it out.</li>
            <li> I probably wouldn&#x27;t have bought this without the amazing deal Philips offered on it. Even then, I fully expected to return it fairly quickly. Yep, it hurt, but I thought, maybe there&#x27;s something I&#x27;m not doing quite right. I thought, hmm, when I tweeze, I grab the hair pretty close to the skin, not at the end... and maybe that&#x27;s what wasn&#x27;t happening with the epilator. (BTW, those lighted tweezers are pretty nice.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So... I did one last shave, and right about when I started seeing little stubby hairs again, I tried the epilator again. Wow, big difference - didn&#x27;t hurt any more, and it just breezed through. VERY nice. I expect I&#x27;ll have to do touch-up every few days for a while, but even that is much better than slicing myself up shaving (yeah, I&#x27;m kind of a klutz with a razor).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I really like this; given the chance for a do-over, I&#x27;d buy it again.</li>
            <li> I purchased an earlier version of this epilator and basically wore it out.  The feature I best like about the Philips&#x27; epilator is the light.  It really is a help.  I don&#x27;t think this epilator is as thorough as the earlier model, but it is still very effective.  It is not as noisy as other models.  Basically, it&#x27;s an epilator that works and, honestly, that&#x27;s all I ask of a product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, after reading others&#x27; comments on this product, I have to say that I agree with all the complaints about the instructions.  They are needlessly complicated and disorganized.  To add insult to injury, the illustrations do not fit any of the instructions.  If I were new to epilators, I&#x27;d have thrown the whole mess in a box and sent it back.  There are a dizzying array of attachments that duplicate function in some cases and none of these are fully explained.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One other caveat that holds for all epilators, not just this one.  DO NOT expect that your legs, or whatever, will be completely hair free for up to 4 weeks.  That is really misleading.  Hair grows at uneven rates and will always be appearing.  Touch ups are necessary, but not as traumatic as a full epilation the first time.  In fact, after the first time, it&#x27;s really not bad at all.  For the first time, go easy, work in segments so that you can see progress -- take your time.  Another thing that is seldom mentioned is the need for exfoliation.  You need to do this at least a couple of times a week in the shower so that you don&#x27;t get ingrown hairs, which really are a pain.  Simply scrub your legs with a loofah or brush to get the dead skin out of the way and apply lotion liberally.  Should be good to go.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s good. just one question about cleaning,&lt;br /&gt;how can I remove the shaving unit from the shave, trim and style attachment?</li>
            <li> bought it for my wife and she loves it,, takes time to used to it but works great</li>
            <li> ALL IT DOES IS PULL HAIR AND IT HURTS. DOES NOT DO WHAT IT IS SAID TO DO. AM PLANNING ON SENDING IT BACK</li>
            <li> My life is much easier now thanks to my new Philips Epilator!!! It works fast and surprisingly quiet. Also, the build-in light is priceless! To those who thinks that it is painful. I have to say that the first touch is more or less hurtful but after couple of seconds, I get used to it.  Don&#x27;t think twice, just order it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Dan K&#x27;s wife.</li>
            <li> I loved it! Very nice and easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;I liked that the different heads give you tons of options to use the product, and come in a nice little bag too!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this epilator for a little under 3 months and overall, I&#x27;m pretty happy.  It is packaged and the product itself is very attractive and female-orientated, it doesn&#x27;t look like a mans razor.  It is comfy in your hands (even for a long period of time) and the light on the epilator is INVALUABLE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;Handles Well&lt;br /&gt;Clear and complete instructions&lt;br /&gt;Well made and sturdy&lt;br /&gt;I love the light on the epilator, really helps at getting at the smaller hairs&lt;br /&gt;Holds a good charge, definitely enough to do both legs, even very slowly&lt;br /&gt;Travel Case is simple and nice&lt;br /&gt;Pain decreases after the first epilation&lt;br /&gt;The hair does gets thinner and easier to pull after each use&lt;br /&gt;Handles hair that grows in different directs pretty well&lt;br /&gt;Cleans easy&lt;br /&gt;Multiple heads for different areas/hair&lt;br /&gt;Tweezer they gave is nice, but not necessary&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;First epilation hurt (similar to waxing just significantly a slower pain)&lt;br /&gt;I may be hairier than the normal gal (Eastern European genes) but it only lasts about 2 weeks (not 4 weeks)&lt;br /&gt;Epilating the arm pits hurt like and hasn&#x27;t gotten better&lt;br /&gt;My skin midly reacts (similar to waxing) however, it does not decrease after each epilation&lt;br /&gt;Skin is freakishly dry unless I use a post-epilation lotion/cream&lt;br /&gt;Despite exfoliating, as per directions, there are still a lot of ingrown hairs&lt;br /&gt;Little rough around the knees/top of feet areas&lt;br /&gt;Its louder than expected&lt;br /&gt;You have to wait awhile for the hairs to grow long enough (not as fun in summer time)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I do really like the epilator, a day after its use, I&#x27;m ready to recommend with 5 stars, however, after about 10 days, I&#x27;m at a three star because its grown back in.  Not it doesn&#x27;t grow back in as thick, however if I shave that means I have to wait even longer to epilate as I wait for the hair to grow long enough.  Hence, the 4-star because I&#x27;m pretty happy with the product, just not with the frequency I have to use it (again, this may just be me).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note about pain: I&#x27;ve waxed many times and this hurts about as much/a bit less but just takes longer.  Definitely have a glass of wine then start at it.  I go quite slowly, about 30 minutes for both legs (could easily do in 20) but I like to be thorough.  If you haven&#x27;t waxed before (or epilated) I&#x27;m sure the first time will be painful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, will recommend to a friend, but continuing to think about it.</li>
            <li> It WORKS!!!, small hair, not a problem, picks up everything, leaves skin smooth for over 2 weeks. BUT IT HURTS A LOT, REALLY HURTS!!</li>
            <li> Love the rechargeable battery aspect.  Forty minutes are adequate.  Light is a necessity and works perfectly.  Ceramic aspect is functions better than other types.  110/220 current is a benefit!  Can recommend product to all.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife and it is the less painful she ever tried. She liked the product and I would recommend.</li>
            <li> it is a great product. i bought this from Macy&#x27;s for myself for $ 150. my mother in law loved it so i got one for her from amazon for under $ 100. very happy.</li>
            <li> I really like my replicator so far. I&#x27;ve had it for a few months now and there&#x27;s no problems with it. It does what it&#x27;s suppose to do.</li>
            <li> I have been epilating for many years now and wanted to try something new.  I usually use the Braun epilator but have found that to get the best results I need to shave at least once in between epilations.  I was trying to find something that I could use every week.  This was not it!  It broke all of my hairs, which defeats the purpose.  It is also loud.  I&#x27;m sticking with my Braun.  Seems to do a good job with little pain.  As another reviewer explained, shaving in between helps because it thickens the tip of the hairs so they pull out easier.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this method of hair removel for many years so it&#x27;s easy now. minimal discomfort. I like it. The price is a bit high, but you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> E x c e l l e n t p r o d u c t f a s t  d e l i v e r y</li>
            <li> Works well. It is fast, easy and gets the job done. It is a lot better then shaving or waxing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUT it stopped working after 2 months. The battery life is short, require recharge after 2 uses.</li>
            <li> This product is very effective and easy to use.  I purchased this product for the different attachments and find that I never use them...my hair grows back very slowly and fine.  After daily shaving, it is a relief to use the Epilator weekly and for touchups.  Great for underarms, legs and the bikini area.</li>
            <li> This product is great.  It has many different uses.  I love it because I can use it on my legs, underarm and even face. It works well even on delicate areas.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using epilators for the past 15 years and this is one of the better ones I&#x27;ve owned. I normally buy the Braun ones but didn&#x27;t like that any of the new ones that you can use in the shower. Who would wanna do that? waste of money for me.&lt;br /&gt;This one has all the bells and whistles you need if you&#x27;re new to epilating. It&#x27;s an got an extension for sensitive spots like under arms and bikini lines. The curve also helps on the legs, knees and other curvy spots. I use the shaving extension and it&#x27;s great!! I also love that it&#x27;s cordless and it lasts for a long time before it needs recharging.&lt;br /&gt;The only downside I have to say is that it&#x27;s a little noisier than the epilators I&#x27;ve owned in the past.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe this listing says specifically, &amp;#34;&amp;#34;Ergonomic design for both sensitive face and body areas&amp;#34; and the item&#x27;s instructions say quite the opposite and its no typo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;People discuss how its better than the Emjoy Emagine, a product definitely geared toward facial use and no one mentioned that the instructions in this thing says right off, &amp;#34;FOR USE BELOW THE NECK.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I called Philips to ask if they had lost their minds because even the BOX says, &amp;#34;Total Body and FACE&amp;#34;.  The clerk indicated it was no typographical error and that he had heard all evening from disgruntled buyers about this 100% conflict between the package, the ads, the hype and the actual instructions.  Has someone perhaps sued their butts over facial destruction so they changed the leaflet but haven&#x27;t had a chance yet to change the glossy box?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m so angry at this misleading mess.  So many are going to grab this for Christmas only to open the directions and have such a bummer of a let down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bad on you Philips!!</li>
            <li> Very unsatifised because the battery life is extremely limited and does not effectively remove hairs.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not going to lie, it HURTS. But it&#x27;s no worse than waxing, and the pain goes away quickly, the result is much smoother than shaving. I would much rather do this at home than have to go to a waxing salon every 3 weeks. Give it some time, practice with the different attachments to see which one works best for you. I use Aloe Vera gel for irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just be sure you check that all the attachments listed in the manual are there. Mine was missing the shaving attachment, which is basically half the functionality of the product. I called the Philips 800 number and the rep was very nice and helpful. They are sending out the part right away.</li>
            <li> I found this difficult to use, and ultimately not worth it. The only area I wanted to use it on was the under arms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro&#x27;s:&lt;br /&gt;- Easy to hold and maneuver&lt;br /&gt;- Easy to clean&lt;br /&gt;- I like the idea of having multiple attachments&lt;br /&gt;- Easy to store in provided bag, not too big&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- It takes multiple passes to remove most of the hair in an area.&lt;br /&gt;- For my underarms, my hair grows in multiple directions, and it was impossible to remove any hair that grew in different directions or in the creases.&lt;br /&gt;- It seemed the hair had to be the perfect length, and all my hair doesn&#x27;t grow at the same rate so this was not possible. It cut off some of the longer hairs without removing, and just couldn&#x27;t grab some of the shorter hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I do think some of these issues were specific to me. I have extremely course underarm hair, and it grows inconsistantly. I also have very sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think if you&#x27;re used to waxing and have success with that, and your hair doesn&#x27;t grow in a crazy mess, you&#x27;ll enjoy the easy and cost effectiveness of this product. I would definitely suggest waxing the area a couple times first to determine whether you&#x27;ll be able to handle the pain and get an idea of the frequency with which you&#x27;ll have to put yourself through that pain.</li>
            <li> I love this product! Quickly removes hair and the attachments are super cool! Only suggestion I might make is for the lighted tweezers to be a bit higher quality.</li>
            <li> Very efficient&lt;br /&gt;I recommend you, but you have to be careful with too small hair, because it doesn&#x27;t work with too small hair</li>
            <li> I only use an epilator for my underarms, so I can&#x27;t comment on bikini or leg use with this or any epilator. I haven&#x27;t tried the shaver or trimmer attachments, so can&#x27;t speak to those either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used several epilator brands and this is one of the best I&#x27;ve ever used. This epilator gets even the really short hairs and pulls them out cleanly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because the head is fairly wide, it can take a few passes at some different angles to get all the underarm hairs out. If this kit included an attachment cap that exposed only a small portion of the epilator head, it would be easier to use for underarms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The light is not so useful during epilation, but is very handy for quickly looking over the job to find the hairs that were missed. The epilator runs very well on a charge but runs corded, too, and the cord is fairly long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the first epilator I&#x27;ve owned with all-plastic &amp;#34;tweezers&amp;#34;, all others were metal &amp;#34;tweezers&amp;#34;.  But so far they are doing the job well, and only time will tell how long the plastic tweezers will hold up.</li>
            <li> I got my epilator a week back and this was my first one. Online reviews encouraged me to try this one and I am glad I did! Let me give you a helpful review for all new users like me who want to try it.&lt;br /&gt;1. PAIN QUOTIENT: Unfortunately there is no unit for pain measurement, but, if you can take the pain of a waxing tug, YOU CAN EPILATE.&lt;br /&gt;Online reviews on pain factor are many a times baseless with nothing to compare it to. Let me tell you, its no more than someone pinching you. Only difference is that here you are anticipating the pinch which makes it harder. I suggest try on a tough patch of skin, like your knee maybe, before you venture to your legs. Proceed slow. And then its not diffucult. I use it now for hands, legs and underarms.&lt;br /&gt;I dont want to give you an idea that its very easy and painless. It hurts definately. BUT its bearable. And the more you get used to it, the lesser painful it gets.&lt;br /&gt;2. DESIGN and EASE OF USE: Just a brilliant and simple product. No hassle device. Easy pictoral guide (I read just the essential and skipped most of the boring word-to-word directions)&lt;br /&gt;9/10 for user friendliness&lt;br /&gt;3. Value for money: May seem a little steep initially but its a one time investment. And completely worth it when it negates all those parlor visits for waxing.&lt;br /&gt;VERDICT: GO FOR IT!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS: simple design, value for money, easy diy at home method, no mess technique, pain completely bearable against the results, handy pouch to store, smart tweezers come along&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS: Noisy, not water resistant/proof, battery life could be better, cleaning brush needs improvement&lt;br /&gt;Yes, I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> ITEM OF EXCEPTIONALLY EXCELLENT QUALITY, GREAT ITEM, GOOD PRICE PRODUCT, DETAILED, WORKS VERY WELL, LOVE THE ITEM, RECOMMEND IT ! A++++++++</li>
            <li> This was the first time I used or purchased an epilator.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. I&#x27;m an Asian Female. My hair type is soft, and fine, yet annoys me (since I have visible amounts that I&#x27;m not happy with as a female).&lt;br /&gt;2. Although the epilator does get rid of most of my hair, it does not get rid of it all.&lt;br /&gt;3. The smaller hair that grows, or finer hair is not picked up by the epilator (which I&#x27;m still struggling against).&lt;br /&gt;4. I do use the epilator on my legs and arms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion: Even though I&#x27;m still struggling to use this, I still find it more beneficial than shaving every couple of days. I like to think that eventually less of my hair will grow in the future. Plus, I still haven&#x27;t tried doing a super exfoliation beforehand, maybe that will help as well? :) Good luck to deciding on whether or not to purchase this product, I hope my review has helped someone out there.</li>
            <li> This item is very usefull.  My wife and daughter use them all the way and like it.  A good package too</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s better than I&#x27;ve expected!!! I can use it everywhere!!</li>
            <li> This is a really nice epilator. The led light is awesome. The ceramic tweezer head really does grip the hairs better than the metal counterparts found on other epilators. The motor is strong and does not yield to stubborn hairs. I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> I must admit that I was scared to death of this thing even as I was ordering it.  My husband called it a medieval torture device.  I was convinced that I would end up only using the shaver head.  But I was determined to give it a shot.  I do have tattoos on both legs from ankle to hip so maybe my pain tolerance is higher than others maybe not.  While it is not exactly comfortable at first by the time i finished one leg it wasn&#x27;t what I would call painful.  More of a mild irritation.  My legs were red afterwards though.  I did what another reviewer suggested and did my legs before I went to bed.  When I woke up I had amazingly smooth legs.  I will never shave with a razor again.  I also used the shaver head which works fine but I don&#x27;t plan on using that part very often.  I like the fact that I can use it while plugged in if needed and it&#x27;s so pretty.  I know that&#x27;s probably not a deciding factor for most people but I like pretty things :).&lt;br /&gt;One other thing - it is loud.  Loud enough to bother my french bulldogs who must have thought I was being attacked because they both came to my rescue.&lt;br /&gt;Overall I am extremely happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I have appreciated the reviewers who have separated their experiences with epilating in general from their experiences of using a specific expilator. So I will begin with the review of this specific product, and if you want to know my experience with epilating in general, you can keep reading.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About the Philips Satin Perfect Epilator . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good things:&lt;br /&gt;1. The ceramic heads are awesome. They&#x27;re very safe. I read reviews of people who ripped up their skin with other epilators that have metal heads. Honestly, in the pictures of those epilators they look like some sort of strange torture devices. The ceramic heads on the Philips are very simple looking and not scary at all. They have never damaged my skin, and I don&#x27;t think they even could. Twice, while epilating, my hand has slipped and my finger has jammed right into the spinning heads. Nothing happened. Somehow, this epilator is able to remove hairs from my underarm without touching the skin tag I have there. I don&#x27;t know how it&#x27;s possible, but it&#x27;s true.&lt;br /&gt;2. I love the fact that I can use this epilator while it&#x27;s charging. I have two kids and a busy life (who doesn&#x27;t?) and I need my epilator to be ready when I am. I get 2 full sessions in each time before re-charging anyway, but if the orange light comes on while I&#x27;m in the middle of a leg I just plug in and keep going. The cord is long enough to reach from the outlet by the sink to the toilet, which I sit on while doing my legs. It charges in about an hour, so I don&#x27;t have to leave it sitting out all day.&lt;br /&gt;3. The different heads and attachments are a nice addition, and I think they may be helpful to someone who is more sensitive to the pain. I quickly left them all behind and just use the regular one so I can get it over with as quickly as possible.&lt;br /&gt;4. The head and attachments come apart and you can run them all under water to clean them. It takes me about 20 seconds to clean everything, then I set the pieces out to air-dry overnight. You can&#x27;t beat a 20 second cleaning time.&lt;br /&gt;5. The light is extremely helpful, in fact, I would never buy an epilator without one. You really need it to be able to see where the hairs are, especially behind the knees and such.&lt;br /&gt;6. It has a very attractive design, and is easy to hold and operate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bad things:&lt;br /&gt;1. The bag it comes with to hold everything is super cheap. For this price, you should really get a nicer case. I mean, really! It comes with these incredible mirror/flashlight/tweezers, but then they give you the flimsiest, most useless piece of fabric to hold it all in. It doesn&#x27;t make sense.&lt;br /&gt;2. The instructions are stupid and badly written.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Those are the only bad things I can think of. Luckily, they do not detract from the overall usefulness of the epilator. I&#x27;ve been using this epilator for about 6 months now, and if it broke tomorrow I would not hesitate to buy the exact same one again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And now for my story on epilating in general . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t shave.&lt;br /&gt;I have eczema, skin tags, double follicles, and ingrown hairs.&lt;br /&gt;I used to shave, and it was horribly painful. Not to mention the fact that I have very thick, dark hair that grows super fast, so even after enduring the pain of shaving, I would have stubble within 24 hours. I have the kind of hair that looks like it has 5 o&#x27;clock shadow immediately. I finally decided that shaving was no longer an option, so I looked for another solution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried epilating. I bought an Emjoi from Target (this was several years ago).&lt;br /&gt;It hurt so bad I cried. I ended up just giving it away.&lt;br /&gt;I spent the next couple of years trying to just be hairy. It&#x27;s hard to do this. People do not react well to a woman with hairy armpits at the swimming pool. Especially when the hair is dark and wiry hair like mine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to start getting waxed. Double ouch. Waxing was extremely painful, bad for my sensitive skin, very expensive, time-consuming, and still didn&#x27;t work all that well. I expected to come home from the salon with baby-smooth skin that would stay hair-free for weeks. Nope. They never could quite get every hair, and I would have stubble in just a few days, even after repeatedly waxing for months. I found a lady in town who could do sugaring, which is MUCH better than waxing. It was far less painful, though still painful, and far better for my skin. Still very costly and time-consuming, and still no long-term results. I could wear a sleeveless shirt and shorts for about 5 days before I would have to cover myself up again. And then I would have to wait for 6-8 weeks before my next appointment. This was obviously not working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I began to feel desperate. Despite all of the drawbacks, I decided to just go back to shaving with an electric razor, but when I was looking them up on Amazon I came across the list of epilators. I knew it was possible that if I bought one I would use it once, cry my eyes out, and give it away just like I had with the Emjoi years ago, and that&#x27;s a lot of money to throw away. I thought about it for a long time and finally figured I would just try to find a way to deal with the pain somehow. I spent many hours agonizing over every product and every review, and I couldn&#x27;t decide which one to try.&lt;br /&gt;I finally chose the Philips Satin Perfect simply based on the fact that it looked the classiest, ha!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m so glad I did.&lt;br /&gt;I love it.&lt;br /&gt;Epilating doesn&#x27;t hurt me anymore, well, it&#x27;s not completely free of pain, but it is absolutely tolerable. The first time I sat down to use it I was so nervous. When I tentatively put it to my leg and felt how little pain there was I actually laughed out loud.&lt;br /&gt;I think all of those waxings and sugarings must have made me less sensitive.&lt;br /&gt;It takes 20-30 minutes to do my legs and underarms, the results last several days, and I can sit down and do it again any time without having to wait for weeks. I can get hair-free in a half hour any time I want.&lt;br /&gt;Seriously. I wear tank-tops all the time, and I&#x27;m not too ashamed to go swimming in public with my kids.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend exfoliating regularly to release in-grown hairs.-consuming, and still didn&#x27;t work all that well. I expected to come home from the salon with baby-smooth skin that would stay hair-free for weeks. Nope.

I wear tank-tops all the time, and I&#x27;m not too ashamed to go swimming in public with my kids.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend exfoliating regularly to release in-grown hairs.</li>
            <li> I received this product on April 15, and it stopped working on May 15. I had this product for 1 month, and it no longer would hold/take a charge. After speaking with Philips Customer Service, the person decided that the product needed an additional charger, as the charger was no longer working. Honestly, I knew this was not the issue because you could hear the charger making noise as it was giving off charge, but I went along with it. Waited until May 29th (2 weeks) to call back (since I still had not received my charger) to tell them my story again and this person said that the previous person did not help me enough, and that I should have been ordered a whole new product, under warranty. Great! So he ordered me a new product on May 29th. I have still not received anything, and it is June 29th. I have been without my product for a month and a half, and I only used it for 1 month.&lt;br /&gt;I had received a notification on the May 29th order that this product was backordered but would arrive on June 24th. After waiting for 3 weeks, I received an email on 6/22 saying the product was still backordered and I would not see it until 7/5. I called on 6/24 to let them know that I will not be waiting any longer, and they told me that the specific color I ordered was backordered, but another color was in stock. I expressed my anger that this was not conveyed to me 3 weeks ago, but had them order the new color. I was assured that this product would be shipped with 2 day shipping, and arrive on Thursday. Now that it is Friday, June 28th, I still have not received the product and called Customer Service back. The women had the audacity to tell me that the person before told me wrong, that 2 day shipping is not an option and even if it was should have never assured me it would actually arrive in 2 days. Instead, she left me on hold for 15 minutes only to come back and tell me that since USPS had picked it up, it was out of their hands to do anything else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will not give this product review a higher score until I can actually use this product for longer than 1 month, granted I receive it in the 2 additional weeks that it will take to arrive.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best purchases I have made this past year!!!! It removes hair well and as directed. The assembly instructions are not very good but that&#x27;s what you tube videos are for.... The epilator feature is what I have used so far. I have not used the trimmer option. That being said even though the directions only say to use the epilator for the legs I have used it for facial hair underneath the chin and for the underarms. Apart from the shock of the initial sting the product claims to do what it says... It removes hair from the roots as if you were using twenty tweezers at once. It&#x27;s quick and effective. My underarms are very smooth.. I do exfoliate everyday, however so this helps. I would like to stop shaving due to dark underarms from razor burns in the past and this is the perfect product to help with that. That being said my legs look and feel the awesomest!!! Never been smoother and it is so much easier to use there than underarms. Love this product!!</li>
            <li> I was really excited to get this epilator through BzzAgent.com. I have been using my old cheap epilator for years now and was excited to find out how a more expensive one would compare. I used it on my legs and underarms. I have a pretty high pain threshold so i did not find it that uncomfortable (but I could just be used to epilating). It is easy to use and comfortable to hold. However, I felt like the epilator did not really pull the hair out from the roots and just merely broke the hair from the skin. I got the same results as i did from a cheap 25 dollar epilator. I ended up having to shave again 2 days later. I am giving 3 stars just for the cordless option and its ease of use and no pain. but i do not think it would be worth paying 100 dollars for.</li>
            <li> I waited until I used this product twice. I wanted to give a fair review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So ok, this thing HURTS like well, it hurts. I have never had a tattoo and I have read the reviews on Amazon that this is what it can feel like. To be honest, after about 5 minutes it really is no big deal.&lt;br /&gt;The contraption comes with different heads, a brush, an instruction manual,  and  an electric shaver head. It also comes with a tweezer that lights up. Love it!&lt;br /&gt;So, where have I used it?&lt;br /&gt;I have used it on my legs, my neck ( I have PCOS), and on the back of my hands. I have also used it on my toe hairs.  I have used the electric shaver part on the pits. I have not braved using this device on parts I am not mentioning,:) Just not that brave.&lt;br /&gt;My 17 year old daughter loves the Satin Perfect Epilator too.&lt;br /&gt;The only drawback is that it does feel like I have some sort of stubble on my leg, but no one gets that close to my leg to notice and you can not \\&quot;see it\\&quot;. I have had several people look.&lt;br /&gt;The 2nd time around, the stubble is less noticeable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few months. It works really well if you fall the instructions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The most significant problem I&#x27;ve had is with ingrown hairs. You can avoid this by thoroughly scrubbing the area you intend to use the epilator on both before and continuously after treatment. I use [[ASIN:B001E96OU6 Neutrogena Oil-Free Acne Wash, 9.1 Ounce (Pack of 3)]].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The unit itself maintains a charge for quite some time and I love the removable head for cleaning. There are lots of parts, so it&#x27;s nice that Philips includes a breathable bag to keep everything together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve recommended this product to friends. It&#x27;s much cheaper than regular waxing and provides a similar result.</li>
            <li> bought this as my old epilady was falling apart-  it is actually faster and gentler than my previous epilator, no need to be nearby a plug as it is rechargeable, and the LIGHT makes things so much easier!  LOVE LOVE LOVE this-  I actually thought about springing the money for laser, but this definitely get the job done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS-  for those commenting on the pain-  epilating HURTS, no matter how you pluck it.  this one actually hurts less than others.  IMO, worth it.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used an epilator since my teenage days.  My mom had an Epilady, which was less like an actual hair remover, and more like a medieval torture device.  After reading several positive reviews, I decided to give the Philips Shave Perfect a try.  It&#x27;s been quite a few years, and light-years in technology, so I figured, how bad could it be?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The answer--awesome, and totally doable!  I don&#x27;t think of myself as having an unusually high pain tolerance, and I didn&#x27;t have any issue at all with using the epilator on my legs.  It does sting a bit, but frankly, lasering and waxing are a lot more painful.  I found that Speed 1 was more painful than Speed 2...I&#x27;d rather the epilator go faster than slower anyhow!  It took about 10 minutes to do both legs from the knee down, so I would guess that 20 minutes for both whole legs is about right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t have any trouble figuring out the right amount of pressure (not very much, just enough to keep full contact with skin), and loved that I can do this dry.  The head is easy to remove/rinse.  I am looking forward to using this epilator a LOT.  Don&#x27;t let the idea of pain deter you; it really was minimal, especially considering what you&#x27;re doing (removing hair at the roots).  Not shaving everyday is really appealing for just shy of a hundred dollars.  :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a guy and I got this to remove hair on the back of my calves that tickles when I wear long pants (which in my neck of the woods is nearly always). This gizmo works as advertised. It removes the hairs by an ingenious plucking motion. It can be a bit painful at times and I imagine that would be more so in more delicate parts of the body. But it is easier than shaving and lasts a long time. I would think that it is not any more painful than waxing (since it is basically the same solution, it only happens in one go). If they could get rid of the \\&quot;yank\\&quot; when the hair is pulled it would be perfect (not sure how an engineer could design that though).</li>
            <li> I ordered it with a standard shipping and I got it for 4 days. I&#x60;ve used so many different epilators - \\&quot;Emjoi Emagine Tweezer - Head Epilator\\&quot;,\\&quot;Emjoi AP99 Optima Corded Epilator\\&quot;, Philips, Panasonic, Braun Silk Epil 7 etc. I started using an epilator since I was 10 years old. I&#x60;ve never shaved and that&#x60;s why probably it doesn&#x60;t cause me any pain. I do it real quick and my body is smooth for weeks. What I like about this epilator is that it&#x60;s cordless,includes razor head, has a good opti-light,four attachments and a pair of illuminating smart tweezers in a nice white little bag. Also, what I noticed is that it&#x60;s way lighter than my previous epilators which is good for me because I travel a lot. I noticed something else, that it&#x60;s not made in China but in Bosnia &amp; Herzegovina and Slovenia,which I trust more. I am satisfied with my order and I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> My wife said it will be last epilator she will need.</li>
            <li> This is the perfect product for those of you that don&#x27;t like shaving. It gives a better and long-lasting result. I will use this always! Philips is a trustworthy brand.</li>
            <li> I got this epilator on Ebay after reading many reviews. I think it&#x27;s great for what it&#x27;s supposed to do and anyone who&#x27;s considering this Philips epilator should understand exactly what it is. This device is meant to rip out your hair with rotating heads. For me, it was just right and less painful than waxing...I&#x27;m not that hairy and don&#x27;t care about that smooth-just-shaved feeling that someone who&#x27;s going on a date might prefer for their legs. I use this mainly on my underarms, just after the shower and before applying deodorant. I don&#x27;t use any of the adaptors or guides. Certain alcohol-based deodorants may cause stinging and sometimes the technique can irritate the skin. It&#x27;s best if you use this every other day and get the right touch. I use light circular motions and direct the heads against the hair growth. Sometimes you need to pull your skin taught to achieve this. You can hear the hairs being caught when you&#x27;re doing it right. Hair has to be about 1/4 inch to be pulled and since each hair grows at different rates, making this a part of your morning routine is best. If you are super sensitive to having your hairs tweezed, this is probably not for you!</li>
            <li> This hurts, but it really works!</li>
            <li> The Satin Perfect is truly that, perfect. I have owned and tried dozens of these machines for the past 15 years and this one is by far the best - easiest to use and clean, smooth results and works great on legs, bikini line and arm pits :-)&lt;br /&gt;I love it so much I have purchased two of them!!!</li>
            <li> Yes, it hurts little bit at first. But the pain is no difference than getting wax or plucked (the pain level).</li>
            <li> I am a veteran when it comes to epilating so I don&#x27;t mind the pain - even armpits and bikini. This epilator is great - works fast, doesn&#x27;t break hair - pulls them out properly and works for about 45 min without charging. Good thing is that you can use it while charging (opposite to Braun epilator). The light is genius, never thought I would need such thing but now I love it. Compared to my previous Philips epilator I have much less ingrown hair than before.</li>
            <li> opened package, charged for required time, used for 2 minutes on my feet...got to ankle, slipped and dropped from 6 inches above floor... case cracked and would not turn on or take a charge after dropping... will see if replacement is any better...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;** update **&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Got my replacement and upgraded my review. The second one I received works and holds a charge fine. First few times using it is painful of course, but if you use this every few days you will see less and less hairs growing back. The ones that do will be thinner and it does become less painful. I would however suggest waxing when it comes to chest, belly and bikini areas. Other suggestions I would make is lotion lotion lotion Before you epilate. Keep your skin hydrated! The drier your skin is the more painful epilating is. Then after epilating, lotion up with the Nivea sun kissed legs shave minimizing lotion. That stuff REALLY works and you will see slower hair regrowth when used after epilation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ceramic head on this is really nice. Does not scratch or burn like some of the metal tweezer epilators out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All around satisfied with it and might look into something more expensive next time.</li>
            <li> I am not gonna say that does not hurt... People... It hurts little but it is worth...my hair is thin and less</li>
            <li> I had another very old Philips Epilator and, in comparison, this one so much faster and more convenient/ easier to use because it&#x27;s cordless. I love all the extra attachments too. My only complaint is that is seems to &amp;#34;break&amp;#34; a lot of hairs instead removing it completely, so I have to use it more often than I would like to for touch-ups throughout the week.</li>
            <li> I have waxed for years but I needed a faster and cleaner method because waxing can be sticky and messy. Plus, you have to warm the wax up so often, it&#x27;s really takes an entire afternoon to do your legs! So I needed a more efficient method and recently got this epilator.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I used to wax I am used to the pain so no complaints there although I am not sure I can use this for my entire bikini area. I have used the epilator a few times in different areas. It is really good but not perfect. There are always stubborn hairs I have to get rid of by using the tweezers (but that happend when waxing too). The tweezers have a built-in light, which is cool. The epilator also has a built-in light that it really helps finding hairs you were not aware of. The trimming head works fine. I really liked the shaving head, it gets the job done perfectly and it is easy to clean. I like that you can rinse the components. The epilator body is comfortable to manipulate. The battery lasts long and doesn&#x27;t take much time to charge. Overall, it&#x27;s a great buy, I hope it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> This hurts worse than getting a tattoo!  Many ppl have posted that eventually the pain will either diminish or you build a tolerance to it. This is true, after a couple weeks I was no longer sweating and shaking and stopping every 30 seconds while using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason I have rated this product so low is it doesn&#x27;t really work. It&#x27;s implied that the hair is pulled out so the area will be smooth. That is a correct statement but what no one seems to realize is HAIR DOES NOT GROW AT THE SAME RATE. The epilator can only grab a hair of a certain length, leaving those that are too short. The next day, those hairs grow a little longer, you use the epilator and so on. I tried this product for 4 months and never actually had a time when my entire leg was hair-free. I tried waiting several days thinking all the hair should be long enough but that was never the case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At least with a razor everything was smooth at the same time.</li>
            <li> All in all a very good product. Too many unnecessary accessories and it is a bit slower than I expected.</li>
            <li> Wow!! This thing really gets to business, cleans up easily, and is rechargeable so the cord never gets in the way!!! The shaver attachment works as well as the Epilator itself, and the light make all the difference when you are trying to work in those hard-to-see areas!!</li>
            <li> I have been using an epilator for a while with pretty good results but I thought getting a more expensive one with more features would work even better. However, this doesn&#x27;t grip the hairs as efficiently as my other epilator. I have to go over the same hairs a dozen times. It also cuts the hair in half instead of ripping it out, which leaves a blunt ends and stubble, I can do that with shaving for a whole lot less. I am quite disappointed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d have it permanently removed, but apparently that&#x27;s hard for light hair. This is not meant for faces, but I&#x27;ve been using it once a month for my lower cheeks and upper neck - very carefully as it can pinch skin if you press around corners. But it&#x27;s a godsend as it was getting distressing to see facial powder accentuate that hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use witch hazel before and after to avoid infected pores (you may have a few red pores the next day). The first couple of times were painful (the same as plucking eyebrows x however more hair you have), but I felt that having it over faster was important as I&#x27;m a pain wimp. it&#x27;s getting easier and less uncomfortable each time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I were smart I&#x27;d probably use a cool pack after I do it, but the pinkness goes away after a couple of hours. Minimal ingrown hairs. The first time you probably should plan to do it on a weekend with nothing else going on. My first time it took several days for the skin to return to normal - but I have very sensitive skin. Whether you use this or other epilators, skin redness will be a temporary issue after treatment until the follicles get used to letting go of the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love how fast it works. Now (after three months of use) I may have a few little bumps the next day, but it&#x27;s not noticeable.</li>
            <li> This is much more painful then waxing. This takes much more time too. The accessories are fragile and the little bag that came with is really cheap. The results are not so good as waxing, but if you don&#x27;t like waxing or if you don&#x27;t want to go to a beauty salon, you can epilate at home with this at anytime. I think this is the only good point of this product. I don&#x27;t regret buying this tough, it works for me. I like the shaving head too.</li>
            <li> What else can be said about this product that hasn&#x27;t already been said?  Yes, it hurts, of course, it&#x27;s ripping out the hair from the root!  But that&#x27;s what makes it great. It is like waxing, in terms of the removal results, but without the ongoing cost, AND more importantly, the ability to clean up strays in between.  I have used it on my bikini line to remove it all, my legs, and for stray hairs on my face and chest.  It&#x27;s great for the upper lip too.  The legs weren&#x27;t painful for me, but the bikini line was.  I trimmed down the hair and did it in small sections over the course of a week (I&#x27;m so  obviously single..haha).  This took like 5 mins a day, not a big deal.  If you don&#x27;t have that kind of time or can&#x27;t deal with a week of patchiness, just get waxed, and then start using this for stray clean up post waxing.  With respect to my legs, I will just glide it over them like once every 7 to 10 days to pick up strays. This takes about 2-3 mins.  The best part of the epilator is not having to shave daily. It&#x27;s so nice to go on vacation without razors and not to purchase razors anymore. The product is environmentally friendly, saves time, and will pay for itself very quickly.  5 stars for sure.</li>
            <li> I bought this item bc I love it from the firs &amp;#34;view&amp;#34; and bc of a lot positive feedback . came in damage box and DOESNT PULL OUT ANY HAIR!!!! don&#x27;t know how long it must be to work. very disappointed</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s my second philips and I absolutely love it. My first one lasted me 10 years. This one is even better with the light and cordless operation. Worth the money</li>
            <li> My sister-in-law has been using one since she was 16 and highly recommended it. I was very hesitant to buy, but read reviews and thought, Why Not!! If you have done laser hair removal it is comparable, just slower. Feels like you would imagine, pulling out each little hair. Like your eyebrows but on a larger scale. It lasts me 4-6 weeks with a touch up in between. Even do my underarms. Don&#x27;t recommend bikini line, Ouch! Way better than having to shave everyday to every other day!! Have never run out of charge but do need to push adapter into unit with a little extra umph. It makes a click noise when it is properly set. Very easy to clean and my daughter loves the light up tweezers. HIGHLY RECOMMEND</li>
            <li> I had been waxing for a couple of years and the time and expense was getting to me.  I thought I would give this a try.  It works - I do not experience any pain, but I believe that is because I waxed for so long.  I find that it takes a long time and I do not get all of the hair, like you do when you wax, but it is not noticeable.  I use this about every 10-14 days in the summer.  My hair tends to grow back quickly.  Overall I am pleased with the product.</li>
            <li> Great item!.  Always works much better than waxing and there is  no mess afterwards</li>
            <li> I received the epilator today. I will list all the points good &amp; bad below.&lt;br /&gt;- The packaging: it was shipped in an envelop-like package, the box was torn and I am so glad the epilator itself wasn&#x27;t broken!&lt;br /&gt;- It was very painful, but that could be due to the fact that I haven&#x27;t used an epilator for a while ( I normally epilate but have been shaving for the past few months after my last epilator stopped wrokig, was a Braun).&lt;br /&gt;- I had to go over the hairs numerous times (leg area and I have dark and thick hairs), and even doing so I could still feel that \\&quot;pricky\\&quot; feeling of the shorter hairs being still there.&lt;br /&gt;- The light is not positioned in the best place and it reflects yellow shade (I thought I had bruises on my legs before I realized it was the light).&lt;br /&gt;- It feels very plastic, I know it is plastic but it feels as though even the tweezers are plastic! The plus of this is it&#x27;s light and comfortable to hold.&lt;br /&gt;- It got hot -but not too hot- after I epilated lower legs, bikini line, and underarms (continuous use). It also had that \\&quot;hot machine\\&quot; smell.&lt;br /&gt;- I have not tried the shaver head yet.&lt;br /&gt;- The fact that it can be used while charging is really good, I like it as I can never finish a full hair epilation session with one charge (was a prolem for me with the Braun).&lt;br /&gt;- It does not look like it looks in the photos, it is less shiny and less elegant (but it&#x27;s not a fashion show).&lt;br /&gt;- A great plus is that it does not pinch my skin, the Braun used to do that (made me bleed at times) and I was always afraid when I used it on sensitive areas.&lt;br /&gt;- The last note is on the big or \\&quot;extra wide head\\&quot;, I didn&#x27;t find it useful, as the head is horizontally wide so it did not feel as if it covered more area, also it made it difficult to epilate in curves areas (underarms, ankle area, and bikini line).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had my eye on The Sharp Image epilator, it is still new and has only a couple of reviews (good ratings) so I thought I would get this one with all its flying reviews. I suppose it did not work best for me, but I am happy that at least it is not pinching my skin!&lt;br /&gt;Next time I would follow my gut feeling and get the one I like or think will like and not entirely based on reviews :)</li>
            <li> From the time of this review, I&#x27;ve had the epilator for about 3 months. I&#x27;ve used this epilator on my legs, under arms, and my cousin&#x27;s arms (heh). I don&#x27;t recommend the bikini area so much - ouch.&lt;br /&gt;Before I got an epilator, I used either use an electric razor or more preferably, wax. So although the pain in using the epilator, I find it bearable. Yes, it hurts, but what device that plucks out your hair doesn&#x27;t?&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-The noise! When I read other reviews before purchasing this, I didn&#x27;t think it would be /that/ bad, especially since I use an electric razor from time to time.&lt;br /&gt;-Instructions on how to attach certain attachments were not clear. I was afraid of breaking things before even getting to try it out. I went through YouTube to get help on this one.&lt;br /&gt;-I think it&#x27;s just me, but I found that epilating my underarms makes it darker than waxing did. My legs were not as noticeable. However, my legs do have some open-looking pores after epilating.&lt;br /&gt;---Also make sure to moisturize and exfoliate, unless you want ingrown hairs!&lt;br /&gt;-I&#x27;m not so much of a fan of the light. I feel like it just reflects off my skin, making it not so easy to see my dark hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-The travel bag and all of the attachments it comes with.&lt;br /&gt;-Easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;-Battery life. You could even use it while it&#x27;s charging! :D&lt;br /&gt;-Hair doesn&#x27;t grow back as fast as shaving.&lt;br /&gt;-The tweezers with the light and mirror. Helps pluck out that one stubborn hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall though, I really like this product and would recommend it.</li>
            <li> The curved head makes it hard to use this on areas of the body that are not shaped that way for example arms or certain parts of my legs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, compared to an old epilator I have, this one does not pick up all the hair which is annoying. I am now using my old one still and really sorry I bought this......</li>
            <li> I have this epilator for 1 year now, and it has some real pros: lithium battery which makes it wireless and usable anywhere and a very very useful led light that points to the right spot of your skin when removing the hairs. Ok, then it also comes with a very smart tweezers with a led light too. That&#x27;s awesome!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But one thing really annoys me: I can&#x27;t stand model regression in any product! This model is far worst than my still 100% working 10 years old \\&quot;PHILIPS satinelle HP6404\\&quot;. The old model with a battery and a light would be a real, real improvement!&lt;br /&gt;Why?&lt;br /&gt;The new model hurts much more! That is easy to confirm while removing hairs by both. The rotating heads are not so soft as the old model. In the old model the heads were/are metallic and the rotation movement was/is more soft.&lt;br /&gt;The new model is not as effective removing hair. Although with a larger head, it fails to remove a lot of hairs and when that happens it hurts more! But also hurts as the rotation movement is more rough. It even hurt the skin without hair! And if you keep it there more than necessary it will scratch your skin! When put side by side in the same area, the new model hurts definitely more. The old model is/was really soft and gentle.&lt;br /&gt;It a pity that years of evolution creates a product that is clearly a regression!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll keep, mainly because of wireless capability, but at home I&#x27;ll continuing relying on the old model to do the job :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Summary:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Light and battery - 5 stars :)&lt;br /&gt;epilator job (the most important!) - 1 star :(</li>
            <li> the battery is not good, if you not use it  for a long time, maybe the battery will not work and can not charge.</li>
            <li> I have never used an epilator....holy crap!  It hurts.  But I am already getting used to it.  The clipper attachment is great and as everyone states...so are the tweezers!</li>
            <li> This Philips epilator is almost identical to one I&#x27;ve used for over a year now, it&#x27;s my favorite and I&#x27;ve tried a few. The ceramic heads grab the hair very well, and do not cause as many ingrowns as metal heads I have used. Easy to clean detachable heads. The &#x27;grab&#x27; is very strong, so that&#x27;s good for removing the hairs, but be careful as it really hurts (more than a weaker grab epilator) if it latches on to a bit of skin, owww! The strong grab is what I like though, less ingrowns (also do use a scratchy pad to exfoliate in the shower every day) and quicker, better hair removal.</li>
            <li> I love this product and I have thick corse hair and I don&#x27;t use that offend. I have already  recommended to everyone my hair hardly grows back since using it for the first month  I&#x27;m in love with this</li>
            <li> GREAT SERVICE &amp; GREAT PRODUCT, THANKS</li>
            <li> I have been epilating for years and recently purchased this to replace an older emjoi model.  Wow, what a difference! Hair removal is significantly less painful and post epilation skin irritation is minimal in comparison.  I have some very fine and light hair that can be difficult to see so the built in light is also very helpful.  Thank you for a great product!</li>
            <li> It hurts a lot so you should have a high tolerance for pain.  But it works as described.  I love the results but I have to admit I dont look forward to doing it every few weeks.</li>
            <li> Works as designed, though if you have thick hair, you will struggled a little bit to remove it properly. Hopefully it will last long.</li>
            <li> It was okay, nothing more or less than expected. The tweezers are perfect, and the best piece of the product.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this product.  I have used similar products but none have worked this well.  Because I have used these for so long, I do not have a problem with discomfort and other ones have left red, slightly irritated skin but this one did not.  I would defiantly recommend this one. I have yet to use any of the attachments so I can&#x27;t comment on their usefulness.</li>
            <li> I have used a Phillips Epillator for over 10 years.  The new one works even better.  I love it!  I hope this one lasts as long as the last one.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s true that you have to be super careful of ingrown hairs I use a pumice stone, and tweezers to pull out and potential problems, but still have issues here or there. I use it for my entire bikini area and underarms. It&#x27;s great in that the area stays smoother for so much longer, plus the hair is thinner and grows back slower. you get used to the pain super quickly, though the first run is the worst.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use and does a great job.  I love that it runs off a battery making it much easier to operate.</li>
            <li> Battery died after 9 months of use and there is no option of replacing the battery. I am getting a cheaper corded epilator.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT:&lt;br /&gt;Sorry, it turned out to be my mistake; I was not connecting the charger firmly to the unit. So it is back from the dead, kicking and pulling hair as it is supposed to do. Although, I might look like a fool by putting this in my review but at least now it is an honest review. By the way, I bought a cheaper corded epliator, keeping both in case one dies on me.</li>
            <li> great this is useful for me. because i need this thing long time, and it is great. really good thing</li>
            <li> works well for my legs, I give it only 4 stars because I wish the on-speed button would be lockable so it does not start on it&#x27;s on in the bag when I carry it around</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace an ancient eplilator.  My old one worked okay, but it took dozens of passes, and a good hour, to get my lower legs done.  Mine was at least 10-15 years old, so I suspected (hoped) that a newer model would work better.  Wow, what a difference!  The light really helps to see the small hairs, and I only needed a couple of passes to get all the hairs.  It was also MUCH less painful than my old one.  The fact that it is cordless is also awesome.  I wish I had bought this sooner!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3/7/13 UPDATE:  I am still really enjoying this product and can also vouch for the excellent customer service provided by Philips when I had a problem with it.  I was using it on my legs this evening and got a bit too close to my underwear.  A piece of elastic got caught up in the mechanism, and then continued to tangle as more and more of the elastic thread got pulled out (old undies, okay?).  The device stopped immediately, but the head was completely tangled with elastic.  I tried to get it out with tweezers, etc, but it was well and truly stuck.  I read the literature, which indicated that the head was not covered by the warranty.  I checked online, but could not find anywhere to order the replacement part, so I started a chat with their customer service via the Philips.com website with the intent of ordering, and paying for, a new head.  Sharon was really helpful and offered to send me a new epilator head at no charge.  The issue was completely my fault, so I really appreciated them going the extra mile.  I will for sure be more careful next time!</li>
            <li> This product is amazing!! It works beautifully all over(Underarms, hands, legs) and the speed control allows you to choose your level of comfort with the pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;YES IT DOES PAIN.. but let&#x27;s get real. When you are pulling hair out from the roots, it will pain. However, since you are running the show, I found that pacing it according to your comfort levels is really helpful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also found that speed I pulls out the finer, smaller hair more easily as compared to speed 2.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is nicely water resistant and washes/cleans well too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the battery is a little weak. Needs frequent charging. But I don&#x27;t care much about it.&lt;br /&gt;And I would strongly discourage from using it on the face. It is pretty powerful and not meant for sensitive skin like that on the face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It gives me freedom from having to set my routine as per parlor timings and be ready for any sudden special occasions as well.&lt;br /&gt;Also, the result is a lot better than even waxing!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would strongly recommend it to anyone who has a lot of sudden plans and can&#x27;t always manage to get to the parlor in time.</li>
            <li> This is just amazing! First of all, great customer service as always. I got the epilator and it got broken at the second use, this things happen some times. I already through out the box and the manual for it but thank god amazon still took it back and send me a new one, free of charge. The second one works just fine. I love the build in light, makes it easier to use. Twizors that come with it are just the best! Very easy to use, and again build in light, very helpful! Charges fast and holds on for a good amount of time. Its worth every penny I spend on it.</li>
            <li> I refuse to shave now. This epilator works awesome. I use it on my underarms. I have been trying to make them lighter and this epilator has helped. It does not really hurt at all. I did feel it the first time because my hairs were really long. Trim your hairs with the little trimmer it comes with then use the actual epilator. I would recommend you buy this one.</li>
            <li> Very good quality and the light helps a lot. Much faster than the previous model I owned. Will definetelly recommend it</li>
            <li> Works but be careful not to scrape your skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used another brand for years so I&#x27;m very used to the sensation of the hairs being pulled out.  My old epilator had metal disks, this one has ceramic.  I don&#x27;t know if the disk material is the difference but the Philips is much more comfortable and works faster.  The disks in the Philips create more of a sensation as they spin against the skin so I don&#x27;t even feel the hairs being pulled out.  The light does help to find stubborn hairs and I like the wider head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As others have said, if you&#x27;re a first time user, have a professional waxing done first, of the areas you will use the epilator, then use this as soon as you start to see hairs grow back - maybe every week or two.  I use it weekly just to keep my legs smooth and so I don&#x27;t see the hairs when I&#x27;m wearing shorts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was hesitant to buy this model because of the price and now I&#x27;m glad I bought it anyway.  This is a great product.</li>
            <li> It is a very good product. I recommend. And shipping is also good.</li>
            <li> After intensive research I bought this product and here my comments based on 5months of usage. Yes, it makes noise but I use some videos or music played to divert my mind from pain and noise. It does a good job but needs several times of application for a neat spot. It is NOT RECOMMEND FOR FACIAL which I missed to read before and I tried using it for upper lips and got full red patches and burnt sensation for 2days. This is well recommended for usage across leg and arms. But NOT FOR DELICATE AREAS including underarms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps. Ask if there are any questions.</li>
            <li> awesome product I have used other operators epilators and this is my favorite especially being cordless with a light And flexible head.the light up tweezers are awesome also!</li>
            <li> love this product…highly recommend this</li>
            <li> It is not very good working.</li>
            <li> Worked for two days. Disappointed</li>
            <li> This epliator does a pretty decent job. I have very fine thin blonde hair, and it seems to struggle to catch them all. I have no issues with it since I love the barely-there hair look on my arms. I&#x27;ve read that a lot of people use this on their legs instead of shaving but I find it to not adequately remove all the hair, but maybe it&#x27;s just my hair type. The only real issue I&#x27;ve had is that some of the hair follicles on my arms got a pretty bad infection, I&#x27;m assuming due to the hairs not being removed properly. It was the same spot on both arms so maybe my skin is just sensitive in those areas. I rubbed some lavender essential oil on it and it healed up quickly so no big deal. Regardless, I love the product.</li>
            <li> My wife really likes her new epilator. She had a cheaper one for many years and it was ok but she really noticed a difference with this New Philips Epilator. Very pleased. Let&#x27;s see how it holds up.</li>
            <li> I was so nervous and hesitant to buy then use an epilator but I&#x27;m beyond glad I did. I didn&#x27;t even know these existed a few months ago and since I&#x27;m sick of shaving everyday, I figured I&#x27;d finally buy one. Before getting the Satin Perfect, I did a lot of research and this seemed like a pretty good one to go with. I love, love, love it! I can&#x27;t sit here and say it&#x27;s pain free...because wow, in some of the more sensitive areas, it&#x27;s far from it but once you get used to it, it&#x27;s really tolerable and isn&#x27;t so bad. I read reviews about those who couldn&#x27;t even handle it despite having gotten tattoos prior so I can&#x27;t lie, I was sweating the first time I used it. But I tried it on the side of my lower leg first after my shower and it wasn&#x27;t bad at all. Near my ankles pinched a lot but it wasn&#x27;t anything terribly bad. Bikini area is by far the worst but I worked slowly and it got slightly easier to deal with. My skin wasn&#x27;t too irritated on my the section of my legs but my bikini area was red until morning. Still, none of the areas hurt after I was done removing the hair. If anyone has ever plucked their eyebrows, it feels like that sting but then quickly goes away. I shaved the day before I bought it and so I only had a days worth of hair growth so I&#x27;m still not entirely &amp;#34;smooth&amp;#34; like I&#x27;d like but I know hair grows at different speeds. It gets better and more smooth with each day I use it. I&#x27;m loving this product and for anyone that&#x27;s scared to use it, just go for it. It&#x27;s seriously worth it!</li>
            <li> i bought it for my wife as a gift and she is very satisfied. and specially extra parts are very useful (she says) ;)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had an Emjoi for years, but thought I would try something new.  This shaver seems to catch more hair than my Emjoi, although I  have to shave several times in different directions as I did with my old shaver.  The Philips also has a closer shave than the old one.  So far, I love it.  The shape is ergonomic and the light is helpful.  It does make a lot of noise, but I think all epilators will do the same.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had many different epilators before and this one just didn&#x27;t cut it. It hardly pulls the hair and you have to go over the same spot multiple times and it still won&#x27;t get all the hair.</li>
            <li> Not very good!  Wouldn&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> Really great for beginners! I love the light, and the speed settings and rollers are perfect. It didn&#x27;t hurt much the first time either, and the results are fantastic!</li>
            <li> Absolutely one of the best epilators! Money well spent! I used Remingron cheep model about $30 one for about 3 years and it&#x27;s day and night comparing to Phillips. I use it all over (legs, arms, under arms, bikini). I will review step by step:&lt;br /&gt;Noice: noice is just as loud as my old epilator. It does not bother me since I am not using it while my family watching a movie or doing homework or something.&lt;br /&gt;Design: comfortable to hold and light.&lt;br /&gt;Ceramic discs: definitely great! My old epilator had metal and was grabbing to the hairs roughly and not removing a lot of them. I had to go over the area more than once, over and over and over. With Phillips ceramic discs it only takes once or sometimes 2 times to go over the area and it removes all the hairs even the most fine and short once. I am never going back to metal, ever.&lt;br /&gt;Light: I love the light! It really helps to see all the little thin hairs. Great idea Phillips!&lt;br /&gt;Pain: it&#x27;s an epilator, it hurts, because it pulls your hairs and specially in most sensitive areas (under arms and bikini area). If you never used epilator before, try twiners first in each area where you think you will use an epilator, it will give you an idea. But like I mention before it&#x27;s so much faster removing all the hairs so it&#x27;s seems less painful since you only doing it in shorter time. Some people mentioned that it is less painful, I didn&#x27;t feel the difference, and I have very high tolerance for pain.&lt;br /&gt;Satin:)): Oh yeah! The name speaks for it&#x27;s self. Skin feels smooth. I have sensitive skin. I used to get rush and bumps from my old Remington. Sometimes the rush took couple days to go away, so I could never use it before going out or hanging by the pool, cause it looked scary. Bumps used to lost even longer. With Phillips I only got rush under arms and it went away in about 10 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;Attachments: I did not use any other attachments and not really care for them.&lt;br /&gt;Overall: don&#x27;t expect painless experience, justso you don&#x27;t get disappointed. I will recommend it to everyone since it does an amazing job!</li>
            <li> It causes in-grown hairs and is not sanitary. It took over a year for my hair cycle to regulate. It is still not perfect. DON&#x27;T BUY IF YOU ARE PRONE TO IN-GROWN HAIRS. I have had too many to count and if they get infected, do not wait to seek a topical antibiotic. I have scars because I waited to treat it. I was just embarrassed.</li>
            <li> I had a Epilady prior to this one and thought I would try a new brand! This was priced great for all the functions it has, but it is a lot more painful than my Epilady, but besides that it gets the job done! Hair is gone, gone, gone!</li>
            <li> This will be short and sweet.  I would definitely recommend this eplator.  It&#x27;s thorough, easy to use, sleek, and appears to be very well built.  For me, I only had to go over the areas I wanted a couple times.  I&#x27;m really looking forward to years of use from it.  Now the part that some people won&#x27;t want to hear,,,,this is an epilator, so it literally rips the hair out by the root.  Keep that in mind.  I use the high speed setting, and it doesn&#x27;t appear to be quite as wakening so to say as the low speed.  It will make you sing zippity doo dah but for what it&#x27;s designed to do, it does it very well.  The lighted tweezers are also a great addition to the things you get.  I do not think I could be any happier with a product than I am with this one.  Hope this helps you make your decision.  As one reviewer said, you get what you pay for and for the price, I am very very satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 2/2/13: Used it on my arms, chest, stomach and down a little lower.  Again, I love this little machine.  It is so thorough and does a wonderful job.  I wish I had been more serious about hair removal earlier in life.  I&#x27;m a guy, and not very hairy, but definitely prefer smooth.  This is a great tool for that process.</li>
            <li> it does not work at my  conutry b/c the voltag 220</li>
            <li> Very nice-followed others advice on how to use it and it worked very well.</li>
            <li> Cant use on face, I guess that&#x27;s my fault I must not have read the fine print. To bad so sad</li>
            <li> Great product. Love the ease of using it, except it doesn&#x27;t last very long, broke within 8 months. The replacement sent by Philips never charged, so it was a lemon to begin with... The product seems to have some quality issue or I&#x27;ve been a very unlucky customer.</li>
            <li> The shaver/ epilator work well for the most part, but does have a few flaws.  It&#x27;s nice having the light on the tweezers, but the tweezers are cheap and don&#x27;t work well.  I used the shaver in the armpits, which has a nice close shave, but I couldn&#x27;t get it to reach the area near my tendon, so I still have to use a razor there.  I also used the shaver in the bikini area and can&#x27;t seem to manuver the shaver around the tendon in my legs, reverting back to the razor.  For the epilator, it works well, but I do have to take the guards off to reach the short fine hairs.  I do have to go in different directions for it to pull all of the hairs out, but it is still worth it.  It did slightly hurt on the first use, but does get better with more use.</li>
            <li> This epilator works fine. It does break some hairs at the skin but also pull some out (50/50). The regrowth is less, likely from the hairs it actually pulls out. Overall it&#x27;s worth a try but don&#x27;t expect 100% results after the first use. It works better over time.</li>
            <li> This is my first epilator... That was really the main purpose of this purchase for me. After years of shaving (I am 35) and having leg stubble hours later I decided to try epilating. I have light colored hair and its also not terribly thick. I thought this would be a great option.&lt;br /&gt;I liked the idea of ceramic disks and thought that sounded like a modern option as well. They do a great job of grabbing at thicker hairs (armpits) but leave all the fine hairs on my legs behind.&lt;br /&gt;This is after doing all the recommendations and using this for over 2 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line... get this if you have thicker hairs and want the shaving option. If you are looking for a true epilator this is not the best choice.</li>
            <li> Since it arrived I have only used it once and was really good. The fact that has so many and different heads and that it&#x27;s wireless makes it even better. I really enjoy it and it doesn&#x27;t hurt at all. It&#x27;s shape is makes it easy to handle and its pattern its very nice. I would recomend it to any one. It comes with a travel bag for easy carrying.</li>
            <li> I am very impressed with this epilator.  I have another one (a Panasonic) that I have used for a few years, but it took several passes over the same patch of skin to pull out most of the hair, and never would pull out all the hairs no matter how many times I went over the skin.  This Philips epilator does a very thorough job.  The first pass got almost all the hair, and the second got the rest.  My legs actually felt smooth, which they never did when using the Panasonic one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pay attention to the instructions and all the comments about needing to exfoliate.  No matter what method you use to pull your hair out by the roots, you will get ingrown hairs if you don&#x27;t exfoliate.</li>
            <li> I was really looking forward to this working, but it doesn&#x27;t.  I tried several scenarios and hair lengths to no avail.  It did do some damage to my skin because it seems to take of the top layer, but leaves the hair.  It is also EXTREMELY noisey, so no way to be discrete about hair removal.  Really dissapointed, it is going back.</li>
            <li> I chose this based on the reviews and while it is good, it is not as good as everyone said. The problem lies when you come to using the epilator to remove partial grow back. The fine little hairs don&#x27;t get caught and have to be quite long. Also the cordless feature only lasts around 40 mins, which isn&#x27;t really long enough to complete both legs. It is a good epilator, just not as good as everyone claimed.</li>
            <li> Works well. Love the fact that it has a light so you can see the fine hairs. Downside is it doesn&#x27;t get the fine hairs.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  Would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> This is my first time using an epilator, and I read all the reviews before buying it... it&#x27;s true that hurts a lot using it, but the result is worth all the pain: my arms and legs are so soft!! The only thing that I didn&#x27;t like was the red points that the process caused in my arms, but I expect they will disappear soon (I hope!)&lt;br /&gt;Edited: It&#x27;s been 4 years, and is still going strong!</li>
            <li> Exceeded expectations! Hellloooo Philips....soooo long emjoi! I&#x27;ve previously owned two emjois, the last one, the emagine, had a piece of that round plastic on the outside edge of the tweezers crack and snap off, just outside the 30-day warranty (cost $140) and emjoi &amp;#34;customer service&amp;#34; couldn&#x27;t repair or replace--they recommended I buy the next best model. So I did, and it&#x27;s this one, a Philips, with a two year warranty. Philips is a reliable company that has been around for many, many more years than the others.This set came with some extra gadgets and a regular set of tweezers that has a mini flashlight and mirror!! The unit itself also has a light on it, which really helps in the spa with subdued lighting! I highly recommend this Philips product.</li>
            <li> Love this Epilator omg so much better than my old one (I had an old Emjoi Soft Caress Epilator - 36 Gold Plated). Definitely worth the purchase!</li>
            <li> too large for facial, particularly upper lip, use.</li>
            <li> I love love love this epilator! Because the roots of my hair are pretty dark, shaving doesn&#x27;t really do the job for me (the roots are visible under the skin, ew). Since this pulls the hair out completely, my skin is left looking smooth (no razor burn!) and uniform. It is a bit painful the first couple times you use it, but after that it&#x27;s completely tolerable. I thought the light would be annoying, but it&#x27;s actually really nice because it helps you see any hairs you might have missed. For anyone who doesn&#x27;t like shaving or the mess of waxing, I would totally recommend this.</li>
            <li> I just received this today and I fell in love after the first use. I tried it on my dad as soon as I took it out of the box and it left a perfectly smooth patch on his arm so I knew it would work for me. It was already charged enough to work right out of the box but I still charged it completely before I did my own legs. It comes with 3 different epilating attachments and a razor head with a trimmer, as well as a great cleaning brush and awesome light-up tweezers and everything fits in the little white bag that it comes with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After showering and drying well, I started with my legs, moved to both arms and last my hands and fingers (I&#x27;m a pretty hairy girl). I used the \\&quot;optimal performance cap\\&quot; for my legs and arms and the basic cap on my hands and fingers. I managed to do all of this in less than 30 minutes on one charge and the low battery light didn&#x27;t even come on. Granted, I am 5&#x27;1\\&quot; but I don&#x27;t think that made much of a difference. The light on the epilator made it easy to see any hairs I&#x27;d missed even in my poorly lit bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m too chicken to epilate under my arms just yet but I did use the shaver/trimmer on them to make the hair shorter for when I do get the courage and it worked perfectly. The little brush cleaned out the hair after each body part and then I just rinsed all the parts off in the sink when I was completely done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not gonna lie, it DOES hurt but if you can handle getting your eyebrows waxed then you can handle this. Everywhere that I epilated feels silky smooth now. An hour and a half later my legs are a little sensitive and tingly but my arms and hands feel fine and I don&#x27;t have any of the redness that I lot of people have described after epilating for the first time. This epilator is expensive but I think all the little extras make it worth the extra money and I would definitely recommend it if you hate shaving like I do!</li>
            <li> Works best for underarms, less painfull than wax for underarms also very quick,   Hurts for bikini area.   Also works for facial hairs.  Bought last week. I liked it a lot. Value to money.  For legs it takes little more time as I have very thin hairs.  Shaver is also very good.  Loved it.</li>
            <li> what my wife was expecting</li>
            <li> Great epilator, works very good on legs, and I love the little light, it actually shows me the spots I missed. The style attachment it comes with is great for delicate areas.</li>
            <li> Everything&#x27;s ok but the &amp;#34;Shave,trim and style&amp;#34; attachement is missing!  The rest in the bow is complete, i wonder how can this be possible!?</li>
            <li> I used to have a Braun epilator, and this one blows it away!&lt;br /&gt;The light is bright, the battery lasts for longer than expected at full power, and the shape of the handle is comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;AS with all epilators, it&#x27;s not completely painless, but it is less painful than many I have previously used, even on more sensitive areas.&lt;br /&gt;I have not used the shaver head, nor have I used the tweezers..yet.&lt;br /&gt;I have bought one of these for my mom, and she loves it too. I&#x27;d definitely reccommend this.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I grow sideburns like a man, crazy genetics. Now chin hairs have started. Hate the 40&#x27;s! Thought of trying the advertised wonder hair remover that&#x27;s advertised every hour on tv but didn&#x27;t think it was worth the $200 price tag.  After reading reviews on it and this product, I decided to give this one a try.  It took some getting use to but now I love it.</li>
            <li> Does the job. Wish it picked up a bit more hair. My first epilator. Maybe they&#x27;re all like this? Definitely hurts...but, that&#x27;s to be expected.</li>
            <li> This was the first epilator that I&#x27;ve used or purchased. I noticed that it creates more ingrown hairs on my legs compared to shaving. I don&#x27;t know if that is a product-specific problem, or a general epilator problem. Anyway, some extra exfoliating and I don&#x27;t have a big problem with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t find the extra attachments useful, however compared to other epilator products and prices, might as well get all of the extra attachments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the ceramic blades. They are easy to remove and fairly easy to clean. The shape of the product fits comfortably in my hand. I like the two-speed function.</li>
            <li> Good but it doesn&#x27;t get the short hairs.</li>
            <li> Use for my face and it works better than any other hair removal I have tried!</li>
            <li> You have to be a sadist to keep using this. I did one half of one leg before I nearly passed out. IT HURTS!!!  Now I&#x27;m no whimp either.  This literally grabs a hair and yanks it out by the roots. Try taking tweezers and yanking out a nose hair. That&#x27;s how it feels, only way more than one at a time, more like one after another after another in rapid succession.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the bright side. If I could have withstood the pain, it would be worth it. That one half of my leg didn&#x27;t need a shave for 3 weeks. So it&#x27;s darn effective. Beauty does come at a price after all!</li>
            <li> This epilator breaks the hair and it does not remove it from the roots. I had a five years Philips epilator which was working greatly but unfortunately I forgot on one of my trips. My old Philips epilator is by far better than this one.</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Quick and Efficient&lt;br /&gt;- Luxury tweezer  in a little lipstick like tube and has a bright LED for plucking.&lt;br /&gt;- Bright light on the shaver/epilator helps see so many hairs that would get missed otherwise.&lt;br /&gt;- Power. It&#x27;s quite powerful and has two speeds.&lt;br /&gt;- Can use while charging.&lt;br /&gt;- Two year warranty&lt;br /&gt;- Love the extra Shaver Head&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- Not waterproof&lt;br /&gt;- Hurts like hell&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Final Result - Good for hand and legs.. For underarm it hurts like hell ! Good and Quick!!</li>
            <li> My old epilator seemed to have lost its umph.  Perhaps the motor was burning out.  I bought this one because it seemed to have good reviews, and I liked the idea of a light.  What I love about it is the curved shape of the blade.  It seems to maneuver better than my old one.  I like the light, although it still helps to do this in a bright area, because you still miss some.  What I am not wild about is the noise.  It does sound like a weed whacker, which I guess it is.  I also will probably never use all the head attachments that comes with it.  I just use the plain epilator one.  I wish they had kept those and lowered the price.  I haven&#x27;t tried the lighted tweezers yet, but I probably will.  The epilator works well.  Better than my old one.  I am glad I bought it.</li>
            <li> In my opinion, this hurts a lot more than waxing, but it does a great job, and the hair takes forever to grow back.  Also, less hair grows back than before.</li>
            <li> Use it for over two years. Happy ith my purchase!</li>
            <li> Purchased for my wife as she wanted to move away from razors and wax. She had a similar product about 5 years ago but she says this is superior in every aspect. Quick and very efficient with a lot less &#x27;missed spots&#x27; and &#x27;pain&#x27;. Sure we have to use an adaptor but that is simple. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always used Remington&#x27;s. I was happy with that brand. I bought the Philips because it was sale, and I wanted a shave-head w/ the Epilator. This works better than I had hoped. Holds the charge longer than listed. The multiple heads give a more comfortable shave. And the trimmer actually works! The first one I had that did.</li>
            <li> I used it everyday. It works very well to remove the hair without pain. I love it and recommend it to other friends.</li>
            <li> Got this for Christmas, I love the bright LED light, it has 2 speeds, and all the interchangeable heads etc. are great and useful! If you have never used an epilator before it might be wise to buy a used, cheap model to see if you can handle it, and upgrade once you get used to it....I love the convenience!</li>
            <li> The addition heads that they offer don&#x27;t really work to well and can actually make it a bit harder to get to some areas.  The trimmer is worth it if you don&#x27;t feel like ripping your hair off one day or just want to do some touch ups.  The message heads are good for beginners but I think anyone that&#x27;s going to epilate should start off with a water proof epilator.  As long as the body doesn&#x27;t get wet on this one, it&#x27;s good</li>
