            <li>have very fine and oily hair.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s fine!  </li>
            <li>I compltelty fell in love with the shampoo.</li>
            <li>I think baby powder works better than any i have tried.</li>
            <li>And has a much better smell than my baby powder.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>Phenomenal scent.</li>
            <li>I love it when I turn my head and catch a hint of this \\&quot;Ahhhhh\\&quot; scent.</li>
            <li>Sexy Hair&#x3D;</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad that Kenra makes this product.</li>
            <li>You can shake can as many times as you want.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok but still doesn&#x27;t beat washing your hair.</li>
            <li>Make sure you shake the can every time you use it.....</li>
            <li>I also love the hairspray Kenra 26 finishing spray.</li>
            <li>but I can understand why it would be better for some people depending on your hair and what your expectations</li>
            <li>No one was going to be touching my hair</li>
            <li>I do think it is better for blondes than brunettes though because it does have a whiter tone.</li>
            <li>It sprays on easily, makes my hair look great for days despite the heat and humidity of the mid-Atlantic in June, and actually smells good.  </li>
            <li>I lave used this product for about 2 yrs &amp; it is the BEST on the market for dry shampoo!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Best dry shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>This has got to be the best dry shampoo I have ever used!</li>
            <li>Best dry shampoo out there!</li>
            <li>This is the best dry shampoo ever!!</li>
            <li>Best dry shampoo that I have tried and am quite pleased how quickly I received the order.</li>
            <li>can be used to add body and is easy to use.</li>
            <li>The product itself works just fine, but the smell is just so unbearable.</li>
            <li>ONCE YOU BRUSH IT THRU, IT&#x27;S FINE AND WORKS WONDERS.  </li>
            <li>This was a fabulous product I think..</li>
            <li>That is so important.</li>
            <li>I have very oily hair, and this is the best dry shampoo I have come across.  </li>
            <li>worth buying !</li>
            <li>and my hair still fluppy and looks clean.</li>
            <li>My scalp feels clean and my hair smells clean as well</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t feel like my hair is clean after using.</li>
            <li>I use it to add texture to my clean hair as well.</li>
            <li>The kind that mostly has to be washed daily.</li>
            <li>The whole line is good, and I really like the brand.</li>
            <li>I love love love Kenra&#x27;s dry shampoo.  </li>
            <li>Sweet Smelling and takes oil right out!</li>
            <li>It is not intended to replace regular shampoos but a good interim way to revive hair in between shampoos</li>
            <li>This dry shampoo is amazing!</li>
            <li>Also, gives great hold for extensions or other styles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s rare that I find a product that I&#x27;m over the moon about, but my hair is just so soft, and it does not get greasy during the day, and it smells so nice</li>
            <li>Worth it if your hair tends to get greasy quickly.</li>
            <li>I have been looking for a dry shampoo that works and also smells good.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always loved Kenra&#x27;s Dry Shampoo</li>
            <li>I have fine, straight hair and this product is a must-have for me.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have also used it as a way to add body to my fine straight hair.</li>
            <li>and she was right.  </li>
            <li>And it really does make your hair and scalp feel clean.</li>
            <li>pretty good but odd smell</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have medium blonde hair with very light highlights.</li>
            <li>This was, hands down, the best dry shampoo I have ever used.</li>
            <li>I have a pretty oily scalp and everything is undercontrol with this.</li>
            <li>I love the product but the last 2 I&#x27;ve ordered have malfunctioned and the sprayer given out while there is still product in the bottle.</li>
            <li>You cannot get the white out if your hair not matter how many times you brush it, massage it, rub it.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m definitely going to buy more.  </li>
            <li>This Kenra product does exactly what it says...</li>
            <li>i can avoid the top of my head looking white.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really need a lot and my hair gets pretty greaseball.  </li>
            <li>I am still searching for my Favorite dry shampoo.</li>
            <li>i LOVE THE SMELL OF THIS DRY SHAMPOO.  </li>
            <li>This has to be my favorite dry shampoo.  </li>
            <li>I love this Dry Shampoo!</li>
            <li>so it is great to only have to use a little so that way</li>
            <li>Most Kenra products smell great, but the smell of this particular product was pretty bad.</li>
            <li>I used to shampoo my hair every day since it&#x27;s very oily.</li>
            <li>If you have hair like mine I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>With this product, I have been able to just wet my hair and use it to absorb the oil.  </li>
            <li>but the scent was too much..</li>
            <li>I am latina ;and have very oily hair .I</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it!  </li>
            <li>I really dig this product.</li>
            <li>No other dry shampoo gives me such great results.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair managageable without being sticky or coarsened, just as soft as it was right after I washed it.</li>
            <li>I have super oily hair and definitely helps maintain that fresh, newly blown out look.</li>
            <li>I was excited when I smelled this one, but it just doesn&#x27;t work without leaving a gunky feeling, and white dust all over my head.</li>
            <li>Neither is it the same as clean.</li>
            <li>and then when I put the lid on it and try again later the inside of the cap is full of what I&#x27;m assuming is the product.  </li>
            <li>I bought this from a store when I couldn&#x27;t find a particular salt spray (that is no longer on the market)and smelled it.</li>
            <li>To be fair, once my hair has dried it does feel rather crispy, which I guess isn&#x27;t the same as oily.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>by the 2nd day it starts to get greasy but one spray of kenra and it looks fresh</li>
            <li>I straighten my hair and it normally lasts two days before having to wash it again.</li>
            <li>It also is constantly leaving that white powder all over my hair, and it isn&#x27;t easy to blend.</li>
            <li>it definitely removes grease and leaves hair looking clean for an extra day or even two.</li>
            <li>The smell is pleasant and it doesn&#x27;t weigh my long hair down, nor does it dry it out.  </li>
            <li>one has the body giving power of Big Sexy with less build-up.</li>
            <li>The aerosol can just spews the carrier 80% of the time, regardless of how much I shake it, hold it upside down vs right side up, etc.</li>
            <li>The aerosol can would rarely spray actual dry shampoo on my hair; instead, it would spray a liquid onto my hair that made it look like I applied too much hairspray and didn&#x27;t rid my hair of oil.</li>
            <li>I love how it adds a little lift and body on that second day when I don&#x27;t wash it.</li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t go clear and can&#x27;t blend.</li>
            <li>Light feel, even on my usually limp hair.</li>
            <li>I have come cross others that work very well, but I couldn&#x27;t handle the smell.</li>
            <li>and you will not waste your money  still</li>
            <li>I am 63 years old and never had that problem....</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used to three times so far without washing in between</li>
            <li>It goes pretty scarily white in some places when you spray it on, and has to be worked at a bit to not leave residue at dark roots, but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>All of a sudden my hair started becoming greasy half way through the day.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pricier than other products, but well worth it.</li>
            <li>and I had such high hopes.</li>
            <li>I have very fine thin flat hair that gets oily really fast.</li>
            <li>Overall I think that this dry shampoo works better than any other I have tried-</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not fruity, not perfumey, and not exactly fresh -- but fresh would have to be the closest way to describe it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit alarming when you first put it on because it looks like you just made your hair greasier, but just run a brush through it</li>
            <li>You have to avoid accidentally getting too much in one spot or your hair will turn white (which can be brushed out but is still a pain).</li>
            <li>It was quite disappointing as it smelled good</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve tried many different dry shampoos before and they all either smell bad, don&#x27;t work after the first few hours, or leave some kind of dry film on my hair and hands.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many other dry shampoo products and all were a waste of money.  </li>
            <li>My only complaint is that it has a tendency to suddenly spray a lot of thick powder, which turns sections of hair bright white.</li>
            <li>It DOES leave white spots if one is not careful, but this is how dry shampoos are unless you are willing to deal with the mess of tints.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t see any flakes; if you do, you might want to ease up a little bit, and give it a chance with just a few squirts on your roots at a time, brush it in, let it dry, and see how it looks, then add more if necessary--don&#x27;t put it on like hairspray on a windy day.</li>
            <li>She even suggested I spray the dry shampoo after my hair was freshly washed and dried....</li>
            <li>To get enough of the dry shampoo to work, I end up almost saturating my hair in the carrier (and that&#x27;s holding it as far from my head as possible.)</li>
            <li>An added bonus is it adds volume to my thin, fine hair.</li>
            <li>My hair is normally limp and flat, but it gave me so much volume!</li>
            <li>If you use too much it does seem to get a little flaky.</li>
            <li>I have tried other dry shampoo with mixed results but really like Kenra.</li>
            <li>* Occasionally the can will blort out a huge glob of white powder, the unpredictability of which is just as frustrating as the unproductive spraying.</li>

            <li> The whole line is good, and I really like the brand.</li>
            <li> I love love love Kenra&#x27;s dry shampoo.  </li>
            <li> Sweet Smelling and takes oil right out!</li>
            <li> It is not intended to replace regular shampoos but a good interim way to revive hair in between shampoos</li>
            <li> This dry shampoo is amazing!</li>
            <li> Also, gives great hold for extensions or other styles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s rare that I find a product that I&#x27;m over the moon about, but my hair is just so soft, and it does not get greasy during the day, and it smells so nice</li>
            <li> Worth it if your hair tends to get greasy quickly.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a dry shampoo that works and also smells good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always loved Kenra&#x27;s Dry Shampoo</li>
            <li> I have fine, straight hair and this product is a must-have for me.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have also used it as a way to add body to my fine straight hair.</li>
            <li> and she was right.  </li>
            <li> And it really does make your hair and scalp feel clean.</li>
            <li> pretty good but odd smell</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have medium blonde hair with very light highlights.</li>
            <li> This was, hands down, the best dry shampoo I have ever used.</li>
            <li> I have a pretty oily scalp and everything is undercontrol with this.</li>
            <li> I love the product but the last 2 I&#x27;ve ordered have malfunctioned and the sprayer given out while there is still product in the bottle.</li>
            <li> You cannot get the white out if your hair not matter how many times you brush it, massage it, rub it.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m definitely going to buy more.  </li>
            <li> This Kenra product does exactly what it says...</li>
            <li> i can avoid the top of my head looking white.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really need a lot and my hair gets pretty greaseball.  </li>
            <li> I am still searching for my Favorite dry shampoo.</li>
            <li> i LOVE THE SMELL OF THIS DRY SHAMPOO.  </li>
            <li> This has to be my favorite dry shampoo.  </li>
            <li> I love this Dry Shampoo!</li>
            <li> so it is great to only have to use a little so that way</li>
            <li> Most Kenra products smell great, but the smell of this particular product was pretty bad.</li>
            <li> I used to shampoo my hair every day since it&#x27;s very oily.</li>
            <li> If you have hair like mine I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> With this product, I have been able to just wet my hair and use it to absorb the oil.  </li>
            <li> but the scent was too much..</li>
            <li> I am latina ;and have very oily hair .I</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it!  </li>
            <li> I really dig this product.</li>
            <li> No other dry shampoo gives me such great results.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair managageable without being sticky or coarsened, just as soft as it was right after I washed it.</li>
            <li> I have super oily hair and definitely helps maintain that fresh, newly blown out look.</li>
            <li> I was excited when I smelled this one, but it just doesn&#x27;t work without leaving a gunky feeling, and white dust all over my head.</li>
            <li> Neither is it the same as clean.</li>
            <li> and then when I put the lid on it and try again later the inside of the cap is full of what I&#x27;m assuming is the product.  </li>
            <li> I bought this from a store when I couldn&#x27;t find a particular salt spray (that is no longer on the market)and smelled it.</li>
            <li> To be fair, once my hair has dried it does feel rather crispy, which I guess isn&#x27;t the same as oily.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> by the 2nd day it starts to get greasy but one spray of kenra and it looks fresh</li>
            <li> I straighten my hair and it normally lasts two days before having to wash it again.</li>
            <li> It also is constantly leaving that white powder all over my hair, and it isn&#x27;t easy to blend.</li>
            <li> it definitely removes grease and leaves hair looking clean for an extra day or even two.</li>
            <li> The smell is pleasant and it doesn&#x27;t weigh my long hair down, nor does it dry it out.  </li>
            <li> one has the body giving power of Big Sexy with less build-up.</li>
            <li> The aerosol can just spews the carrier 80% of the time, regardless of how much I shake it, hold it upside down vs right side up, etc.</li>
            <li> The aerosol can would rarely spray actual dry shampoo on my hair; instead, it would spray a liquid onto my hair that made it look like I applied too much hairspray and didn&#x27;t rid my hair of oil.</li>
            <li> I love how it adds a little lift and body on that second day when I don&#x27;t wash it.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t go clear and can&#x27;t blend.</li>
            <li> Light feel, even on my usually limp hair.</li>
            <li> I have come cross others that work very well, but I couldn&#x27;t handle the smell.</li>
            <li> and you will not waste your money  still</li>
            <li> I am 63 years old and never had that problem....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used to three times so far without washing in between</li>
            <li> It goes pretty scarily white in some places when you spray it on, and has to be worked at a bit to not leave residue at dark roots, but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> All of a sudden my hair started becoming greasy half way through the day.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pricier than other products, but well worth it.</li>
            <li> and I had such high hopes.</li>
            <li> I have very fine thin flat hair that gets oily really fast.</li>
            <li> Overall I think that this dry shampoo works better than any other I have tried-</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not fruity, not perfumey, and not exactly fresh -- but fresh would have to be the closest way to describe it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit alarming when you first put it on because it looks like you just made your hair greasier, but just run a brush through it</li>
            <li> You have to avoid accidentally getting too much in one spot or your hair will turn white (which can be brushed out but is still a pain).</li>
            <li> It was quite disappointing as it smelled good</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried many different dry shampoos before and they all either smell bad, don&#x27;t work after the first few hours, or leave some kind of dry film on my hair and hands.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many other dry shampoo products and all were a waste of money.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it has a tendency to suddenly spray a lot of thick powder, which turns sections of hair bright white.</li>
            <li> It DOES leave white spots if one is not careful, but this is how dry shampoos are unless you are willing to deal with the mess of tints.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t see any flakes; if you do, you might want to ease up a little bit, and give it a chance with just a few squirts on your roots at a time, brush it in, let it dry, and see how it looks, then add more if necessary--don&#x27;t put it on like hairspray on a windy day.</li>
            <li> She even suggested I spray the dry shampoo after my hair was freshly washed and dried....</li>
            <li> To get enough of the dry shampoo to work, I end up almost saturating my hair in the carrier (and that&#x27;s holding it as far from my head as possible.)</li>
            <li> An added bonus is it adds volume to my thin, fine hair.</li>
            <li> My hair is normally limp and flat, but it gave me so much volume!</li>
            <li> If you use too much it does seem to get a little flaky.</li>
            <li> I have tried other dry shampoo with mixed results but really like Kenra.</li>
            <li> * Occasionally the can will blort out a huge glob of white powder, the unpredictability of which is just as frustrating as the unproductive spraying.</li>
            <li> To avoid washing my hair daily I use dry shampoo.</li>
            <li> It is the only dry shampoo I will use.</li>
            <li> Last week I used this dry shampoo two days in a row.</li>
            <li> I can see how this would be gross or annoying for users but as long as it looked good</li>
            <li> I know it&#x27;s not healthy to wash it every day, but I have long, fine but thick hair that tends to be oily as well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The only problem is when I colored my hair a darker color, this product dulls the hair.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s wet, sticky, and dries white.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t even fluff your hair to get the white out.</li>
            <li> I get sick from smelling it on my hair all day and honestly, my friend smelled it and she agreed that it just has this salami scent to it.</li>
            <li> I have used various brands of dry shampoo and because I had not tried the Kenra brand, decided to give it a try as I ordered other Kenra Products from  Amazon at a lower price than retail.</li>
            <li> My sister recommended this dry shampoo to me, so trusting her judgement I ordered two bottles.</li>
            <li> Seen this on clearance and bought it just to give it a shot bc I have literally tried tons and tons of dry shampoos.</li>
            <li> I have curly course dry hair and get it blown out.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like this dry shampoo.</li>
            <li> Then, she recommended Kenra Platinum Dry Shampoo...</li>
            <li> My hair stylist recommended this dry shampoo</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only gotten about half the usage.</li>
            <li> it clogs half way through  buy the smaller size</li>
            <li> I only need just a little on my roots and it takes the oily grossness out of my hair.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not like other dry shampoos that leave your roots greasy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other dry shampoos before and not had a problem.</li>
            <li> : The nozzle broke after only a few weeks of infrequent use....</li>
            <li> I have been trying to use this for the last few weeks.</li>
            <li> The bottle didn&#x27;t come unpressurized or empty</li>
            <li> but unfortunately I only got to use this bottle a few times before it stopped working.  </li>
            <li> When I first purchased this product, I expected to be disappointed yet again with &amp;#34;dry shampoo&amp;#34;... I&#x27;m glad I was wrong.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other brands and they don&#x27;t compare.</li>
            <li> I use this product about every other day.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t brush out easily when this happens, but you can wipe the powder away using a towel, so I guess it&#x27;s not that bad.</li>
            <li> I ordered on Amazon and received my dry shampoo within a few days.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s  not worth the price .</li>
            <li> I have dark hair</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t like any dry shampoo&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Nobody wants bad smelling hair especially when you are trying to conceal the fact that you didn&#x27;t wash it!&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li> so I didn&#x27;t mess with it</li>
            <li> over&amp;#34; with your toilette but need to perk it up a little.</li>
            <li> I have always needed to wash my hair everyday because it&#x27;s oily.  </li>
            <li> My hair dresser recommended a few shampoos...</li>
            <li> Once it dried, my hair looked dusty, and no amount of working my hair with my fingers would get rid of the powdery white.</li>
            <li> too bad, i really wanted to like this product</li>
            <li> and I cannot bring myself to look past that.</li>
            <li> such a fail</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to describe but it wouldn&#x27;t brush out either.</li>
            <li> I have very thick, very dark hair</li>
            <li> Now it did make my hair feel thick, stiff and heavy during that time and it felt weird</li>
            <li> I usually use baby powder (I&#x27;ve always heard bad things about dry shampoo, so I never bothered), but I got a small bottle</li>
            <li> This product leaves my hair looking like I stuck my finger in a socket, have really bad dandruff and got white paint in my hair.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;-Bumble&#x3D;way too expensive and tinted varieties messy and stain everything</li>
            <li> Still no good.</li>
            <li> felt this product only made it worse ;and in addition ,it also made my hair smell really bad.</li>
            <li> Such a disappointment :(</li>
            <li> Maybe I just got a defective product, but I hated the Kenra Dry Shampoo.</li>
            <li> I am guilty of washing my hair every day.</li>
            <li> It smells really bad</li>
            <li> but it could have been bad if my hair was darker</li>
            <li> Will not spray, very unhappy.</li>
            <li> WORST MISTAKE EVER!</li>
            <li> Disgusting!</li>
            <li> I like the smell but beyond that, it&#x27;s been terrible.</li>
            <li> This is the worst Kenra product ever.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Best I have tried .  I have blond hair , and the white-ish spray is not a problem, but seems to disappear</li>
            <li> My sister recommended this dry shampoo to me, so trusting her judgement I ordered two bottles. WORST MISTAKE EVER! It smells really bad and I cannot bring myself to look past that. The product itself works just fine, but the smell is just so unbearable. I get sick from smelling it on my hair all day and honestly, my friend smelled it and she agreed that it just has this salami scent to it. No idea why! Disgusting!</li>
            <li> To avoid washing my hair daily I use dry shampoo. I have tried other dry shampoo with mixed results but really like Kenra. The product smells great. You have to avoid accidentally getting too much in one spot or your hair will turn white (which can be brushed out but is still a pain). If you use too much it does seem to get a little flaky. However, it feels like you get a good amount in one bottle and it lasts a good amount of time. The spray system works well for distribution. I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> does a really nice job</li>
            <li> Great when you have to skip washing your hair one day</li>
            <li> This has got to be the best dry shampoo I have ever used! Great product and smells nice.</li>
            <li> This was a fabulous product I think.. I only got to use it once and now the aerosol bottle isn&#x27;t working and nothing will spray.</li>
            <li> I used to shampoo my hair every day since it&#x27;s very oily. After using this product, I did not have to shampoo my hair every day now and my hair still fluppy and looks clean. My used it alot now especially when on travel</li>
            <li> I compltelty fell in love with the shampoo. It&#x27;s not like other dry shampoos that leave your roots greasy. I have a pretty oily scalp and everything is undercontrol with this. My scalp feels clean and my hair smells clean as well, it is a great product</li>
            <li> Seen this on clearance and bought it just to give it a shot bc I have literally tried tons and tons of dry shampoos. I have very fine thin flat hair that gets oily really fast. I used this and it gave my hair volume and for several days did not have to wash at all and it look great. If you have hair like mine I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Overall I think that this dry shampoo works better than any other I have tried- it definitely removes grease and leaves hair looking clean for an extra day or even two. My only complaint is that it has a tendency to suddenly spray a lot of thick powder, which turns sections of hair bright white. It doesn&#x27;t brush out easily when this happens, but you can wipe the powder away using a towel, so I guess it&#x27;s not that bad. Worth it if your hair tends to get greasy quickly.</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t like any dry shampoo&#x27;s. I think baby powder works better than any i have tried. However, this stuff works amazing. And has a much better smell than my baby powder. I love it</li>
            <li> I have fine, straight hair and this product is a must-have for me. I bought this from a store when I couldn&#x27;t find a particular salt spray (that is no longer on the market)and smelled it. Phenomenal scent. Light feel, even on my usually limp hair. I love how it adds a little lift and body on that second day when I don&#x27;t wash it. It makes my hair managageable without being sticky or coarsened, just as soft as it was right after I washed it. And,it just smells so good throughout the day. I love it when I turn my head and catch a hint of this \\&quot;Ahhhhh\\&quot; scent. Wish I could describe what the scent is, but it is like nothing I&#x27;ve smelled before. It&#x27;s not fruity, not perfumey, and not exactly fresh -- but fresh would have to be the closest way to describe it. And it really does make your hair and scalp feel clean.</li>
            <li> I am still searching for my Favorite dry shampoo. The smell of this one is actually really great, It&#x27;s just the product itself that needs work. It leave a \\&quot;gunky\\&quot; feel on the hair after applied. After being sprayed, I will fix my hair and then have to wash my hands because all of the gunk on them from this product. I don&#x27;t feel like my hair is clean after using. It just feels like I sprayed something that got rid of the oil. It also is constantly leaving that white powder all over my hair, and it isn&#x27;t easy to blend. Even my husband notices all the white left. I have been looking for a dry shampoo that works and also smells good. I have come cross others that work very well, but I couldn&#x27;t handle the smell. I was excited when I smelled this one, but it just doesn&#x27;t work without leaving a gunky feeling, and white dust all over my head.</li>
            <li> This is a great product and I have tried MANY of these:&lt;br /&gt;-Oscar Blandi invisible&#x3D;HORRID/ineffective&lt;br /&gt;-Big Sexy Hair&#x3D;a lot of build up&lt;br /&gt;-Psssst/Batiste/other drugstore brands&#x3D;ineffective&lt;br /&gt;-KRS&#x3D;pretty good but odd smell&lt;br /&gt;-Bumble&#x3D;way too expensive and tinted varieties messy and stain everything&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one has the body giving power of Big Sexy with less build-up. It DOES leave white spots if one is not careful, but this is how dry shampoos are unless you are willing to deal with the mess of tints. I wash my hair once or twice a week so this is a godsend. Also, gives great hold for extensions or other styles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***EDIT: The nozzle broke after only a few weeks of infrequent use....such a fail***</li>
            <li> This is the best dry shampoo ever!! I&#x27;ll never use anything else. I can go two solid days without washing my hair because I can spray this in my hair on day two and it leaves it great smelling and soaks up the oil. It&#x27;s amazing ! I&#x27;ve tried other brands and they don&#x27;t compare.</li>
            <li> I have been trying to use this for the last few weeks. I like the smell but beyond that, it&#x27;s been terrible. The aerosol can just spews the carrier 80% of the time, regardless of how much I shake it, hold it upside down vs right side up, etc. To get enough of the dry shampoo to work, I end up almost saturating my hair in the carrier (and that&#x27;s holding it as far from my head as possible.)* Occasionally the can will blort out a huge glob of white powder, the unpredictability of which is just as frustrating as the unproductive spraying. I&#x27;ve used other dry shampoos before and not had a problem. The bottle didn&#x27;t come unpressurized or empty so I can&#x27;t think of any reason to think it&#x27;s defective, but it might as well be.  *To be fair, once my hair has dried it does feel rather crispy, which I guess isn&#x27;t the same as oily. Neither is it the same as clean. I accidentally grabbed a similar looking bottle of aveda hair spray one day I wanted to use it and ended up with a similar effect.</li>
            <li> I love the product but the last 2 I&#x27;ve ordered have malfunctioned and the sprayer given out while there is still product in the bottle. I&#x27;ve only gotten about half the usage.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so pricey I just switched to baby powder which essentially does the same thing. This didn&#x27;t make my hair feel as greasy as others and has a good smell. Not something I&#x27;ll buy again though,</li>
            <li> I love love love Kenra&#x27;s dry shampoo.  A hair dresser told me this was the best one and she was right.  I have curly course dry hair and get it blown out.  by the 2nd day it starts to get greasy but one spray of kenra and it looks fresh AND it gives you volume.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!!! I use this product about every other day. I&#x27;m so glad that Kenra makes this product. If you travel, look for the smaller size.</li>
            <li> When I use this spray, it leaves a power residue in my hair.</li>
            <li> I have always needed to wash my hair everyday because it&#x27;s oily.  With this product, I have been able to just wet my hair and use it to absorb the oil.  The only problem is when I colored my hair a darker color, this product dulls the hair.  I would only use on lighter colored hair.</li>
            <li> This works great when you can&#x27;t &amp;#34;start over&amp;#34; with your toilette but need to perk it up a little. An added bonus is it adds volume to my thin, fine hair.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like this dry shampoo. It&#x27;s wet, sticky, and dries white. You can&#x27;t even fluff your hair to get the white out.</li>
            <li> I lave used this product for about 2 yrs &amp; it is the BEST on the market for dry shampoo!&lt;br /&gt;I just spray it on &amp; work it in &amp; it looks like I&#x27;ve just washed it.  Love it!!!</li>
            <li> Whoa. This is the worst Kenra product ever. You cannot get the white out if your hair not matter how many times you brush it, massage it, rub it. It stuck in your hair. You can shake can as many times as you want. Still no good. But seller shipped in a timely manner.</li>
            <li> it clogs half way through  buy the smaller size and you will not waste your money  still worth buying !</li>
            <li> Very good product for use in between shampoos.  Leaves hair refreshed and feeling good.  It is not intended to replace regular shampoos but a good interim way to revive hair in between shampoos</li>
            <li> Thought it would be different than it turned out to be.  It&#x27;s ok but still doesn&#x27;t beat washing your hair.</li>
            <li> I love this product! Doesn&#x27;t show white streaks in hair. I have super oily hair and definitely helps maintain that fresh, newly blown out look. Adds tons of volume too! I&#x27;ll be getting this again for sure!</li>
            <li> This brand is better than anything you can get at walmart!!</li>
            <li> Ordered this after my stylist used it on me at salon. Very pleased and smells great!</li>
            <li> I love this Dry Shampoo! It is the only dry shampoo I will use. It doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling gritty. I use it to add texture to my clean hair as well.</li>
            <li> Will not spray, very unhappy.</li>
            <li> All of a sudden my hair started becoming greasy half way through the day.  My hair dresser recommended a few shampoos...Nothing worked.  I couldn&#x27;t believe it...I am 63 years old and never had that problem....Then, she recommended Kenra Platinum Dry Shampoo...What a difference!  She even suggested I spray the dry shampoo after my hair was freshly washed and dried....I tried it....What a difference....So...now I am hooked.  I ordered on Amazon and received my dry shampoo within a few days.  It is very easy to use...Make sure you shake the can every time you use it.....If not, it will settle in the bottom.I am very happy with my selection.</li>
            <li> This dry shampoo is amazing! Put in your hair before bed for best results, still works great in the morning too!</li>
            <li> Maybe I just got a defective product, but I hated the Kenra Dry Shampoo. Most Kenra products smell great, but the smell of this particular product was pretty bad. The aerosol can would rarely spray actual dry shampoo on my hair; instead, it would spray a liquid onto my hair that made it look like I applied too much hairspray and didn&#x27;t rid my hair of oil. Once it dried, my hair looked dusty, and no amount of working my hair with my fingers would get rid of the powdery white. This product leaves my hair looking like I stuck my finger in a socket, have really bad dandruff and got white paint in my hair. I&#x27;ll stick with my $6 bottle of TreSemme.</li>
            <li> This smells really great. Sweet Smelling and takes oil right out! I also love the hairspray Kenra 26 finishing spray. The whole line is good, and I really like the brand.</li>
            <li> I love Kenra products but this clogged after the second use and was useless after that. It was quite disappointing as it smelled good and I had such high hopes.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great!  My hairdresser recommended this shampoo and I am very impressed.  I usually use baby powder (I&#x27;ve always heard bad things about dry shampoo, so I never bothered), but I got a small bottle and I&#x27;m definitely going to buy more.  It&#x27;s rare that I find a product that I&#x27;m over the moon about, but my hair is just so soft, and it does not get greasy during the day, and it smells so nice, I had to write a review.  It&#x27;s a bit alarming when you first put it on because it looks like you just made your hair greasier, but just run a brush through it and it&#x27;s fine!  I have very thick, very dark hair and I don&#x27;t see any flakes; if you do, you might want to ease up a little bit, and give it a chance with just a few squirts on your roots at a time, brush it in, let it dry, and see how it looks, then add more if necessary--don&#x27;t put it on like hairspray on a windy day. I don&#x27;t really need a lot and my hair gets pretty greaseball.  I&#x27;ve used to three times so far without washing in between and I don&#x27;t feel like I have any buildup.</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t care for the smell of the product therefore i don&#x27;t use...it may be effective...but the scent was too much..</li>
            <li> My hair stylist recommended this dry shampoo and I wanted to try it since it smelled good as well. I am guilty of washing my hair every day. I know it&#x27;s not healthy to wash it every day, but I have long, fine but thick hair that tends to be oily as well.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried many different dry shampoos before and they all either smell bad, don&#x27;t work after the first few hours, or leave some kind of dry film on my hair and hands.&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is great and it smells great too! That is so important. Nobody wants bad smelling hair especially when you are trying to conceal the fact that you didn&#x27;t wash it!&lt;br /&gt;And my hair still looks good too, it doesn&#x27;t look like it&#x27;s not been washed.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to my friends!</li>
            <li> The is the best I have tried so far but I can understand why it would be better for some people depending on your hair and what your expectations are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very fine and oily hair. The kind that mostly has to be washed daily. Last week I used this dry shampoo two days in a row. Now it did make my hair feel thick, stiff and heavy during that time and it felt weird but it looked great and smells GREAT so no one knew. I can see how this would be gross or annoying for users but as long as it looked good I did not care. No one was going to be touching my hair anyway so it saved me time and trouble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have medium blonde hair with very light highlights. One day the spray looked like white flakes or powder in my hair. It&#x27;s hard to describe but it wouldn&#x27;t brush out either. It wasn&#x27;t too noticeable so I didn&#x27;t mess with it but it could have been bad if my hair was darker so I can see that as a problem for people. But like I said it only happened once.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have also used it as a way to add body to my fine straight hair. It doesn&#x27;t hold like hairspray but if I spray it on the roots at the crown of my head, I can tease it to give it some lift throughout the day. I don&#x27;t have to do this and Im not saying it gives you big hair. Just saying it can be used that way which this southern girl likes. (LOL)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I like it because it hides the oily shine, takes away the oily matted look, smells great, can be used to add body and is easy to use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always loved Kenra&#x27;s Dry Shampoo but unfortunately I only got to use this bottle a few times before it stopped working.  I can&#x27;t get anything to come out and then when I put the lid on it and try again later the inside of the cap is full of what I&#x27;m assuming is the product.  Such a disappointment :(</li>
            <li> I am latina ;and have very oily hair .I felt this product only made it worse ;and in addition ,it also made my hair smell really bad. I ended up washing it out anyways. It&#x27;s  not worth the price .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many other dry shampoo products and all were a waste of money.  This Kenra product does exactly what it says... it refreshes and revives my hair between washings.  The smell is pleasant and it doesn&#x27;t weigh my long hair down, nor does it dry it out.  My color doesn&#x27;t fade with use of it.  When I first purchased this product, I expected to be disappointed yet again with &amp;#34;dry shampoo&amp;#34;... I&#x27;m glad I was wrong.</li>
            <li> I have very oily hair, and this is the best dry shampoo I have come across.  I would highly recommend it!  I do think it is better for blondes than brunettes though because it does have a whiter tone.</li>
            <li> Best dry shampoo out there!</li>
            <li> I really dig this product. It goes pretty scarily white in some places when you spray it on, and has to be worked at a bit to not leave residue at dark roots, but it&#x27;s worth it. No other dry shampoo gives me such great results. I love this stuff - always make sure I have it on hand now!</li>
            <li> I have used various brands of dry shampoo and because I had not tried the Kenra brand, decided to give it a try as I ordered other Kenra Products from  Amazon at a lower price than retail. It is fantastic!!  Best dry shampoo that I have tried and am quite pleased how quickly I received the order. It is a keeper.</li>
            <li> Smells great and it feels refreshing.</li>
            <li> Best dry shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used. I straighten my hair and it normally lasts two days before having to wash it again. This product allows me to go 3-4 days before washing my hair (unheard of!)! My hair is normally limp and flat, but it gave me so much volume! I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Used 1 time--then nothing would come out next time.</li>
            <li> This was, hands down, the best dry shampoo I have ever used. It sprays on easily, makes my hair look great for days despite the heat and humidity of the mid-Atlantic in June, and actually smells good.  It&#x27;s pricier than other products, but well worth it.</li>
            <li> Works well and smells wonderful!</li>
            <li> i LOVE THE SMELL OF THIS DRY SHAMPOO.  IT DOES GO ON WHITE, BUT ONCE YOU BRUSH IT THRU, IT&#x27;S FINE AND WORKS WONDERS.  IT ALSO ADDS A LOT OF BODY TO MY HAIR ON THOSE IN BETWEEN DAYS OF NOT WASHING IT.</li>
            <li> This has to be my favorite dry shampoo.  One of these bottles lasts me about 3 months.  I only need just a little on my roots and it takes the oily grossness out of my hair.  I have dark hair so it is great to only have to use a little so that way i can avoid the top of my head looking white.</li>
            <li> the powder product is white and stays white. doesn&#x27;t go clear and can&#x27;t blend. have to brush it all out. too bad, i really wanted to like this product and i wanted it to work.</li>
