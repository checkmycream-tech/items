            <li>Tried this conditioner from a sample in a NYC hotel and loved it.</li>
            <li>guess I am a guy who likes to be well kept and likes good quality product</li>
            <li>products feel great, smell great and have a really nice refreshing</li>
            <li>My curly hair never looks better and attractive, muted smell.</li>
            <li>Smells nice, leaves my hair feeling good.</li>
            <li>I stayed at a really nice 5 star hotel in LA with work and this product along with the Mint Shampoo were in the bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Very light scent.</li>
            <li>It was just okay.</li>
            <li>Love this conditioner.</li>
            <li>I always LOVE Malin &amp; Goetz products.  </li>
            <li>Love this conditioner.</li>
            <li>I treated myself because I love the smell of cilantro.</li>
            <li>Thanks for a great product.</li>
            <li>I loved them right away.</li>
            <li>Great fragrance and a conditioner that seems to be effective with dry hair.</li>
            <li>Wonderful, light conditioner that does not weigh my hair down.</li>
            <li>Made a huge difference in my hair.</li>
            <li>I really think this has a nice fragrance</li>
            <li>Great for daily use and care.  </li>
            <li>This is a very nice, light conditioner that actually seems to disappear into the hair before I rinse it out.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a decent conditioner, and works nicely.</li>
            <li>My hair was static by the end of the first day after washing.</li>
            <li>Pricey but worth it!</li>
            <li>Love the creative scent combinations and natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t normally spend money on (non-drugstore) product, I&#x27;d say that there are better products out there to try when splurging.</li>
            <li>I was expecting an herbal, fresh cilantro scent, based on the product&#x27;s description.</li>
            <li>Not only does it detangle, the light formula disapears into my hair and rinses easily.</li>
            <li>I first used these products in a hotel in California.</li>
            <li>The printed letters started falling off the bottle with the first use (as mentioned in another user&#x27;s review).</li>
            <li>My hair is bouncy, soft, non-frizzy, and looks clean.  </li>
            <li>However, if you tend to favor more masculine, spicy scents and have super dry hair, it might appeal to you.</li>
            <li>wife is super sensitive to smells and ingredients in products but also has used them and has no problem.&lt;br /&gt;More</li>
            <li>They should really call it Coriander Conditioner.</li>
            <li>Yes, it&#x27;s absolutely a first-world problem, but for $20+/bottle, maybe it shouldn&#x27;t happen?</li>
            <li>It does not smell like cilantro - just regular clean shampoo smell.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair that is easily weighed down and shows build-up, and changes with different water types.  </li>
            <li>like I just came out of a high quality barbers.</li>
            <li>great and expensive.</li>
            <li>I first sampled it in a private club in Rhode Island.</li>
            <li>While it contains both coriander seed and cilantro leaf extracts, coriander seed is actually listed first in the ingredients, and it smells like coriander seed, and not at all like cilantro.</li>
            <li>Regardless of the climate and water conditions the Malin + Goetz keeps my color treated hair smooth without being heavy or greasy.  </li>
            <li>My hair has NEVER been so soft.</li>
            <li>Recommend for short straight hair especially.</li>

            <li> I use the peppermint shampoo, but sometimes leave it behind and use hotel shampoo.  </li>
            <li> What an expensive luxuary</li>
            <li> That was disappointing for me.</li>
            <li> This smelled unpleasant and did not seem to do anything for my hair.</li>
            <li> Coriander isn&#x27;t terrible, but I was expecting cilantro based on the name &amp; description.&lt;br</li>

    <ol>
            <li> My eyes stung with each use just from the fumes/smell. My hair was static by the end of the first day after washing. Shame.</li>
            <li> This smelled unpleasant and did not seem to do anything for my hair. It was just okay.</li>
            <li> Smells nice, leaves my hair feeling good.</li>
            <li> great and expensive. These were our sample shampoos in our beautiful hotel in Mexico and I needed more! What an expensive luxuary</li>
            <li> Regardless of the climate and water conditions the Malin + Goetz keeps my color treated hair smooth without being heavy or greasy.  I first sampled it in a private club in Rhode Island. I use the peppermint shampoo, but sometimes leave it behind and use hotel shampoo.  I NEVER leave the conditioner at home.  It goes where I do.</li>
            <li> Love this conditioner. Pricey but worth it! My curly hair never looks better and attractive, muted smell.</li>
            <li> Smells great but way over priced.</li>
            <li> I was expecting an herbal, fresh cilantro scent, based on the product&#x27;s description. However, the scent is definitely a spicier coriander seed smell. It does condition my hair, but I have to be careful to use a very small amount or my hair looks greasy and weighed down. It seems to remove body from my hair, too. For the money, I&#x27;ll stick with Biolage. However, if you tend to favor more masculine, spicy scents and have super dry hair, it might appeal to you.</li>
            <li> Amazing conditioner!  Made a huge difference in my hair.</li>
            <li> Ace Hotel in Portland OR hooked me on this conditioner. My hair has NEVER been so soft. Recommend for short straight hair especially.</li>
            <li> My Daughter loves this brand and now I am hooked as well! Love the creative scent combinations and natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> Fab product. makes my hair look twice as thick, really. Try it!</li>
            <li> I am not a fan of cilantro in food but I had a coupon for 30% off (local retailer) so I purchased this with the peppermint shampoo and a few other MG products. This is a very nice, light conditioner that actually seems to disappear into the hair before I rinse it out. I really think this has a nice fragrance but it&#x27;s not really too representative of cilantro. I notice the smell occasionally during the day, have not seen any product buildup and would definitely recommend this to people who like quality product (product w&#x27;s/junkies). If you don&#x27;t normally spend money on (non-drugstore) product, I&#x27;d say that there are better products out there to try when splurging.</li>
            <li> I always LOVE Malin &amp; Goetz products.  HOWEVER, the red print on the back side of the bottle rubs off while in the shower.  Yesterday I had what someone thought were &amp;#34;blood spots&amp;#34; on my temple - turned out it was the print from the bottle.</li>
            <li> Love this conditioner.</li>
            <li> I first used these products in a hotel in California. I loved them right away. My hair never gets dull no matter how long i use them. They also don&#x27;t change my hair with different water type.</li>
            <li> Tried this conditioner from a sample in a NYC hotel and loved it. Great fragrance and a conditioner that seems to be effective with dry hair. I have used this product with the Peppermint shampoo for over 4 years. A bit pricey though.</li>
            <li> I stayed at a really nice 5 star hotel in LA with work and this product along with the Mint Shampoo were in the bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;I guess I am a guy who likes to be well kept and likes good quality product but every so often you come across one which just feels different and nice.&lt;br /&gt;These products feel great, smell great and have a really nice refreshing feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife is super sensitive to smells and ingredients in products but also has used them and has no problem.&lt;br /&gt;More over she always comments when I sue the product that it smells like I just came out of a high quality barbers.</li>
            <li> Actually absorbs into the hair and truly conditions it instead of sitting on the surface and just leaving it slick after rinsing.  I only use a small amount ( that&#x27;s all you really need) and a bottle lasts a long time. I was using Pureology before. Malin Goetz leaves Pureology in its dust.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a decent conditioner, and works nicely. I treated myself because I love the smell of cilantro. However, my hair is not so needy that I require a premium conditioner. I won&#x27;t repurchase for two reasons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. They should really call it Coriander Conditioner. While it contains both coriander seed and cilantro leaf extracts, coriander seed is actually listed first in the ingredients, and it smells like coriander seed, and not at all like cilantro. That was disappointing for me. Coriander isn&#x27;t terrible, but I was expecting cilantro based on the name &amp; description.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. The printed letters started falling off the bottle with the first use (as mentioned in another user&#x27;s review). I used this product as I would any other conditioner, and that&#x27;s never happened before. Yes, it&#x27;s absolutely a first-world problem, but for $20+/bottle, maybe it shouldn&#x27;t happen? (see photos)</li>
            <li> Great for hair and smells very refreshing.  Not greasy or build up effects.  Great for daily use and care.  Thanks for a great product.</li>
            <li> Wonderful, light conditioner that does not weigh my hair down. Found it on a trip to San Juan Island at the hotel and had to buy it. Very light scent.</li>
            <li> I bought this when I saw a recommendation in a magazine (GQ I think). Personally, it is way overpriced, and does nothing for my hair than ordinary drugstore products provide.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair that is easily weighed down and shows build-up, and changes with different water types.  I got a sample of this conditioner and I bought the full-size after just two days.  Not only does it detangle, the light formula disapears into my hair and rinses easily. My hair is bouncy, soft, non-frizzy, and looks clean.  It&#x27;s a little pricey but I only need a small amount (like, nickel-size). It does not smell like cilantro - just regular clean shampoo smell.</li>
