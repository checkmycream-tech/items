            <li>Well worth the reasonable price!</li>
            <li>I have wanted to try this product for a while now, and I can honestly say that all of the rave reviews on other sites are true.</li>
            <li>My two year old son always wants some on his fingers and toes just like Mommy at night :)</li>
            <li>Pink Sugar is my favorite sent!</li>
            <li>My nails are already in pretty good condition, but I&#x27;ve been having issues with one nail peeling and a few hangnails.</li>
            <li>I really like these cuticle oil pens, although I am not crazy about the &amp;#34;crisp&amp;#34; scent.</li>
            <li>I have tried at least 10 popular cuticle balms, creams, and oils, most of which make my hands feel very greasy.</li>
            <li>I ordered the crisp scent</li>
            <li>Their facebook page is full of glowing recommendations because everyone loves this nail oil as well as the many other products offered.  </li>
            <li>Amazing product!I have very dry skin and its a challenge to keep my cuticles and skin round my nail area looking nice.</li>
            <li>ok so maybe not professional where the polish is concerned</li>
            <li>I love this product, but usually order the fragrance free, and accidently got the Crisp, I do not like the scent at all</li>
            <li>I love long nails, I had acrylics on for about 6 months to get the length I wanted</li>
            <li>I seem minor improvements in my cuticles, I more like that my hands are moistured</li>
            <li>I was always taping my super short nails because of tears below the quick that kept snagging on things.  </li>
            <li>Amazing results for little effort.</li>
            <li>As part of an overall nail care routine, this oil is quite effective had eliminating peeling and bringing back a certain level of moisture to the nails.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a lifelong nail biter and have been getting better about stopping and growing out my nails.</li>
            <li>I was hesitant to try it because I really didn&#x27;t want to have greasy hands/fingers.</li>
            <li>fragrance free next time around in there vat size(4oz) bottle ..</li>
            <li>So I didn&#x27;t use two of these scented brushes and half of the first one because the scent is not my favorite....</li>
            <li>Even before using Bliss Kiss, I kept my nails and hands well moisturized with lotions and other cuticle oils or creams, so I found myself applying the product probably more than I should have.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li>, I cannot wait to re order my normal no scent.</li>
            <li>we waste money in more ways then we think....</li>
            <li>The stuff is ok but for some reason it doesn&#x27;t last very long.  </li>
            <li>you found the ultimate nail oil right here.</li>
            <li>This is a new staple for me &amp; my nail care.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I get the big 4oz bottle directly from the maker now since I use it so much</li>
            <li>If you want to get something to really treat your nails and cuticles right...look no further...</li>
            <li>I like the way my natural nails look</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t want them to look like they are  50 years old</li>
            <li>My nails were already thin and damaged before, but now they are getting much stronger and more resilient.</li>
            <li>It sinks right</li>
            <li>I  use these scents until my other order I placed came in from there direct site to get a new fragrance cause I couldn&#x27;t with hold smelling this product scent of crisp</li>
            <li>and hangnails started forming again, demonstrating that it wasn&#x27;t simply a fluke that these conditions stopped while using this product but rather a direct result of the oil.</li>
            <li>It turned my dry cracked cuticles so soft and now my nails look as if I have had a professional manicure....</li>
            <li>and my nail beds are ridiculously shiny and smooth and are longer in growth appearance..</li>
            <li>I have used this now for three months, faithfully (4-8x daily), and though I noticed improvement early on, my nails are back to where they were in my youth.  </li>
            <li>cuticles are not nearly as dry</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like really long natural nails on my self...</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is my second purchase of this product and I love it!</li>
            <li> My nails are already in pretty good condition, but I&#x27;ve been having issues with one nail peeling and a few hangnails. I kept hearing great things about Bliss Kiss&#x27;s oil, but wasn&#x27;t totally sure. Since most of the reviews seemed to be extreme issues getting better, I figured mine were beyond that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went ahead and did the 3 day naked challenge when I received these pens. Had I known how quickly I&#x27;d go through one pen, I&#x27;d have probably gotten the starter kit. Even before using Bliss Kiss, I kept my nails and hands well moisturized with lotions and other cuticle oils or creams, so I found myself applying the product probably more than I should have. By the end of the 3 days, one pen was almost empty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product itself is outstanding. I love the fact it is more of a dry oil than what I&#x27;m used to. Like I said, my cuticles were already pretty well-hydrated, but I did notice they are looking even better now! After three days my hangnails are mostly gone. Even better, my peeling nail is looking better than ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve actually already purchased more and plan on giving them out as gifts!</li>
            <li> Fast free shipping Ave this product works wonders!</li>
            <li> this Pure nail oil is magic for your nails. i&#x27;ve been a fan for a long time. shipping is super quick, and quality is unbeatable.</li>
            <li> Amazing the result is very satisfied</li>
            <li> This is my favorite cuticle oil. Love this pen because it is so easy and handy. I keep one in my bathroom, by my chair and in my purse. Use it several times throughout the day especially after my hands are in water. My cuticles have never looked better!  Very easy to refill!</li>
            <li> I have wanted to try this product for a while now, and I can honestly say that all of the rave reviews on other sites are true. I have been using this for almost a month now and I am definitely pleased with the results that I am seeing. My nails were already thin and damaged before, but now they are getting much stronger and more resilient. Not to mention, I absolutely love the Crisp scent. Bliss Kiss Pure Cuticle and Nail Oil is an excellent product and I will definitely be ordering the refill kit soon.</li>
            <li> I really like these cuticle oil pens, although I am not crazy about the &amp;#34;crisp&amp;#34; scent.</li>
            <li> Love this oil, does a good job of keeping my cuticles in good shape.  Love the smell!</li>
            <li> I never go a day without applying Bliss Kiss nail oil. I have pens all over my house, purse, and backpack! This stuff keeps my nails hydrated, long, and flexible. The pen makes it easy to apply to my cuticles and underneath my nails. I use them on my feet also to keep them looking fabulous for summer. I would highly recommend this oil to anyone and everyone!!!</li>
            <li> My daughters LOVE this product and introduced me to it. I started to use it and I then gifted a sample of it to my sister, mom, and grandmother for their nails.We now ALL use it and just LOVE it. Our nails have all grown, they are strong and healthy looking. We use them for mani and pedi treatments. My grandmother has diabetes and her feet and nails are super healthy and just look beautiful, in part, because we continue to do her nail/cuticle treatments with the oil. I will now be purchasing the larger bottle to refill our pens. Convenient, efficient, safe, natural, easy... what more can one ask for!?! We LOVE the ease of the pens and being able to have one easily accessible in the purse, night stand, the office, etc. So convenient.</li>
            <li> I love this product. The oil is not too thick &amp; its not watered down. Its just right. It penetrates the nail bed &amp; moisturizes my cuticles perfectly.  1-pen lasts about 3 weeks. I plan to order the refill.  This is a new staple for me &amp; my nail care.</li>
            <li> Love having these around.  I keep one by my bed, one in my coat pocket, and one in the kitchen.  They&#x27;re great!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this item about a week but I feel like I see a difference already. I&#x27;m a lifelong nail biter and have been getting better about stopping and growing out my nails. They were looking awesome last year but some stress sent me back to biting and I&#x27;ve been struggling to get them to grow out at all and stay strong on top of it all. In addition, my new career requires me to wear gloves and wash my hands many times throughout the day so my fingers are just taking a beating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did the 3 day challenge thing and keep applying as much as possible.  The pens are super convenient and it&#x27;s not annoyingly greasy. Plus it smells awesome! The skin around my nails already looks better and I swear they have already grown a bit and seem stronger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still have pens left but don&#x27;t want to run out so just ordered the refill bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m excited to have nice nails again :)</li>
            <li> Amazing product!I have very dry skin and its a challenge to keep my cuticles and skin round my nail area looking nice. I have tried at least 10 popular cuticle balms, creams, and oils, most of which make my hands feel very greasy. This oil has improved the appearance of my problem areas in a short period of time. I also love the applicator pen. Its great because I can easily apply it at work or during the day without the pads of my fingers getting oily.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! After 30 days of daily use, ny nails had grown 1 centimeter. I highly recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;If it doesn&#x27;t work for you, you&#x27;re doing it wrong.</li>
            <li> This stuff is the bomb diggity!!  Wait, do people still say that?  I got turned on to this amazing nail oil a couple of years ago.  It turned my dry cracked cuticles so soft and now my nails look as if I have had a professional manicure....ok so maybe not professional where the polish is concerned but ya know what I mean lol.  Not only are Bliss Kiss products amazing but the staff is incredibly sweet and always so very helpful.  Their facebook page is full of glowing recommendations because everyone loves this nail oil as well as the many other products offered.  Not only do they work well but they smell sooooo good.  If you want to get something to really treat your nails and cuticles right...look no further...you found the ultimate nail oil right here.</li>
            <li> I cannot recommend this oil enough. As part of an overall nail care routine, this oil is quite effective had eliminating peeling and bringing back a certain level of moisture to the nails. I have one nail, however, that will split no matter what but it does seem to be waiting longer to do that than it did before so there&#x27;s hope for it. I also mix a little of this oil in with my normal hand lotion to get an extra boost every time I put the lotion on. And always use the oil after hand washing. Sometimes I just use the oil as a hand lotion. It sinks right in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I get the big 4oz bottle directly from the maker now since I use it so much but these pens are convenient for traveling. They can be refilled but it&#x27;s a pain so I would just purchase more and save the hassle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have problem nails, get this oil. You&#x27;ll love it!</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite new beauty products! I was hesitant to try it because I really didn&#x27;t want to have greasy hands/fingers. However, my cuticles were constantly getting hangnails and my nails were peeling. I chose this cuticle oil due to the brush applicator, which is a wonderful feature - allowing accurate and easy application that is mess free. Your nails and cuticle area truly do absorb the oil after a minute or two, and the scent is subtle and fresh. After using the product for a couple of weeks, I stopped using it for a few days and my nails started peeling several days after and hangnails started forming again, demonstrating that it wasn&#x27;t simply a fluke that these conditions stopped while using this product but rather a direct result of the oil. After ordering a single pen, I then ordered a 3 pack so I could stash a pen in my purse, at work, and in my nightstand. Amazing results for little effort. Well worth the reasonable price!</li>
            <li> This seemed to have dried my cuticle out really bad, instead of moisturizing them. Not as advertised, I could have just used olive oil instead a waste of money. I ended up having to dip my cuticle in olive oil and vinegar with baking soda for 5 mins. daily to get the moisture back into my cuticles. I will not purchase this anymore.</li>
            <li> The absolute best cuticle oil out there. Crisp is my favorite!</li>
            <li> I love this product, but usually order the fragrance free, and accidently got the Crisp, I do not like the scent at all, I cannot wait to re order my normal no scent.</li>
            <li> Excellent oil ! Very hydrating for nails &amp; cuticles!! Great buy. Works well in all weather/seasons.. Even chilled winter time!</li>
            <li> Love this product.  Works really good.</li>
            <li> This is the absolute best nail oil out there. I use it several times a day. It keeps my nails from drying out, splitting, peeling, or breaking. Pink Sugar is my favorite sent! I can&#x27;t reci this product highly enough!</li>
            <li> I have used this now for three months, faithfully (4-8x daily), and though I noticed improvement early on, my nails are back to where they were in my youth.  Actually they are even stronger.  I have to file them down because they get too long.  Ha!   I&#x27;m almost 60 and have been on meds for 20 years that zap the moisture from my body.  I was always taping my super short nails because of tears below the quick that kept snagging on things.  I had tried every nail oil and strengthening polish there is, well over $100 spent.  This stuff works! Anyway, three months of heavy use hasn&#x27;t even depleted the oil in the pens by 50%.  So the price is a bargain.  I&#x27;m not even going to bother trying to refill them, I&#x27;ll just order more pens whenever I run out.  They&#x27;re definitely worth the money.  I&#x27;m ecstatic!</li>
            <li> I am in love with this stuff!! My nails literally drink this up!! My cuticles used to be dry and my nails were thin and brittle. They used to crack up the sides and it was painful. I couldn&#x27;t grow nails for anything (besides pregnancy and nursing, which doesn&#x27;t last forever).&lt;br /&gt;  I began using the Bliss Kiss nail oil pens, taking two biotin per day &amp; using OPI Nail Envy... And within two months my nails are growing strong and healthy! My nails have never been this strong before.&lt;br /&gt;My cuticles are not nearly as dry and I thank Bliss Kiss for this! I ordered the crisp scent and I love how refreshing it smells. I have given several of these as gifts to others. My two year old son always wants some on his fingers and toes just like Mommy at night :)</li>
            <li> Just got it in today &amp; I can already feel the hydration on my cuticles and nails!!!!! I love long nails, I had acrylics on for about 6 months to get the length I wanted but as soon as I took them off my real nails became weak and brittle. I like the way my natural nails look and I feel with this product I will get great results!!! I love the smell as well!!!!</li>
            <li> Excellent! My nails never looked better since I began using Bliss sticks.</li>
            <li> The stuff is ok but for some reason it doesn&#x27;t last very long.  It empties quickly</li>
            <li> I seem minor improvements in my cuticles, I more like that my hands are moistured and I don&#x27;t want them to look like they are  50 years old and they are only twenty something. I did the 3 day hydration and all i have is more strength in my nails which is a great thing and my nail beds are ridiculously shiny and smooth and are longer in growth appearance.. I don&#x27;t like really long natural nails on my self... But I might try and see how long they can possibly get and stay that long... I  use these scents until my other order I placed came in from there direct site to get a new fragrance cause I couldn&#x27;t with hold smelling this product scent of crisp and I went with the winter scent starter kit so much better or just fragrance free next time around in there vat size(4oz) bottle .. So I didn&#x27;t use two of these scented brushes and half of the first one because the scent is not my favorite.... But I do recommend this product... Try it before hand and if some one you know says it doesn&#x27;t work for them still tryi it because everybody body chemistry is a little different from the next so it might not work on your best friend or your mom but it might work on you do not judge it until you try it for yourself...there customer service is just okay to me...  Give it go we waste money in more ways then we think....</li>
