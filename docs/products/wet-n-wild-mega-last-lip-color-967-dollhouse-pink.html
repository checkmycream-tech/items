            <li>i love this lipstick just got it ben killing the hell out of it it</li>
            <li>I love this color.</li>
            <li>Probably not that great for older women</li>
            <li>One of the best colors they have loves how long it stays on your lips n</li>
            <li>I have many pink shades of lipsticks, but this one is the best!</li>
            <li>it gives just the right amount of sexiness without going over the top!</li>
            <li>the picture is very true to color.</li>
            <li>I wear a lot of neutral colors and this pink is perfect with everything.</li>
            <li>but because I opened it already &amp; have to make the best of it by combining this pink with a lighter one.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s wonderful Barbie doll pink without being shiny, so you don&#x27;t look like you smeared goo all over your face.</li>
            <li>Good Price, Fast Shipping.</li>
            <li>First of all, let me say that this Dollhouse Pink lipstick is a beautiful shade that enhances my medium coloring and reddish hair very nicely.</li>
            <li>The perfect pink lipstick!</li>
            <li>it applies smoothly and it comes naturally neat on lips nice color and its very cute</li>
            <li>i loved the color , but the lipstickwas kind of dry</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this lipstick it looks great.</li>
            <li>I came across this product and was so happy that I finally found the correct shade.  </li>
            <li>It goes on smooth &amp; after 2 coats the color</li>
            <li>Unless your lips are always moist and smooth and wrinkle free this lipstick is NOT for you.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not as big as the picture,but I am happy with the product.</li>
            <li>The pink is fabulous and a beautiful texture.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s nice, colors a little bright, not an every day wear</li>
            <li>I bought it thinking it would be very matte because I love matter lipsticks, it was not that matte to me.</li>
            <li>Its very matte and cute color.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very noticable which is why I love it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just glad that this color doesn&#x27;t stain my skin as much as the others.</li>
            <li>NOT BAD</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an absolutely beautiful and bright soft pink (it&#x27;s very bright but soft, not hot fuchsia!).</li>
            <li>Wet N Wild has gorgeous lip colors!!!</li>
            <li>and it is really bold</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not even a pink lipstick kind of person, but I love this color.</li>
            <li>This color is very cute and works on numerous skintones (</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very pretty color.</li>
            <li>Very pretty color--makes you feel like a princess.</li>
            <li>The application is very light and would need touch ups very frequently</li>
            <li>For me it&#x27;s kind of a strong pink</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so bright and pink.</li>
            <li>dollhouse pink is perfect, so ladylike, mature, and sexy at the same time!</li>
            <li>color is vibrant and even though its a matte lipstick it glides on easily.</li>
            <li>please it will be so worth it and also came a day befor</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re in search of a bright, yet wearable pink lipstick, go for this one!</li>
            <li>I think that it&#x27;s nice for what it is and the slight slope on the top of the cap really does it for</li>
            <li>Usually pinks do not show up against my natural lipcolor at all, but this goes on opaque and perfect.</li>
            <li>Wet &amp; wild did a good job of making this lipstick for a cheap price.</li>
            <li>I loved this lipstick really high pigments but the cap always slips off have to be super careful taking it off</li>
            <li>6 days FREE shipping from California to New York?</li>
            <li>I love pink lipstick, and mostly light lipstick.  </li>
            <li>It goes on dry, so you have to use some kind of emollient on your lips before applying the lipstick.</li>
            <li>But over all it got to me fast and is exactly as it was explained!</li>
            <li>Nice pink but a little bright.  </li>
            <li>I am an avid user of higher end cosmetic brands</li>
            <li>this color looks pretty online</li>
            <li>Finally I&#x27;ve found my FAVORITE color.</li>
            <li>That, and the dryness, are the only reasons it gets 4 stars :)</li>
            <li>kinda long lasting also, great buy.</li>
            <li>as for the lipsticks, they are super highly pigmented.</li>
            <li>THEY HAVE GREAT PIGMENTATION AND LAST A REALLY LONG TIME !&lt;</li>
            <li>The color is a very bright pink, like a bubblegum pink.</li>
            <li>The shipping was pretty fast</li>
            <li>: It goes on very MATTE so chapstick or something before/after. ;-)</li>
            <li>beautiful color and stays on pretty long as well, plus the cheap price is a serious bonus too.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s really a pretty color, and any one who likes pink will love this shade..  </li>
            <li>It applies smoothly and stays on for hours, leaving a very pleasant pink stain behind.</li>
            <li>non the less, the amount should last me the entire year, so it was an excellent buy!</li>
            <li>Last Lip Color is a super product, if it meets your requirements for a matt-only lipcolor!</li>
            <li>You can apply more for going out or a special occasion, but I usually just apply some to my bottom lip and then press my lips together.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very matte color</li>
            <li>VERY MATTE VERY PIGMENTED.  </li>
            <li>really, really pops...</li>
            <li>its a sexy pink</li>
            <li>, all of these lipsticks are very slippery, if you will.</li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t apply and was very cakey.</li>
            <li>anyways it&#x27;s my favorite pink colored lipstick.</li>
            <li>its really more pink than you think it is.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a beautiful pink that compliments my dark skin tone very well.</li>
            <li>The color was MUCH brighter than I had anticipated.  </li>
            <li>I love the wet n wild lipsticks.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not thick.</li>
            <li>/move around so much during the application that I got some out of my natural lip line.</li>
            <li>look for wet n wild stick lip gloss for a good pink color.</li>
            <li>I received this a few days ago and I absolutely love it...</li>
            <li>As I began to put it on, I liked the color that was slowly appearing.</li>
            <li>Easy to tone down.</li>
            <li>The buyer will definitely get more bang for their buck with this pink.</li>
            <li>Make my lips super dry.</li>
            <li>Definitely a wild color!</li>
            <li>I have dark hair and light skin.</li>
            <li>Nowhere near it!</li>
            <li>/&gt;i got this product a day earlier and than estimated and its truely the same color as diplayed on the web.</li>
            <li>You literally only need to do one swipe or even dab it on and the color is so vibrant and the color is so vibrant.</li>
            <li>(Be aware that every Wet n Wild lipstick is particularly dry at first, but as you continue to rub the color against your lips it becomes much softer.)</li>
            <li>I would advise wearing a clear or neutral lip liner with it.</li>
            <li>WHERE YOU CAN SEE THESE IN ACTION</li>
            <li>/&gt;Secondly, if you purchase this Mega Last Lip Color understand that it is a very matt finish.</li>
            <li>and the problem was fixed</li>
            <li>Ordered this with another item both came in a timely fashion however it was old.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s dry though but that exactly what I likes about it .</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s VERY matte and boisterously pink, but if you put on just a little with some chapstick on top, it brings out my blue eyes!</li>
            <li>The pink is a pretty color though.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this color, though you will need a Chapstick or smooth base as it goes on very dry/matte.</li>
            <li>If you like hot pink that is!</li>
            <li>The description says &amp;#34;semi-matte,&amp;#34; which should be enough to tell you that it&#x27;s pretty dry.</li>
            <li>This lipstick feels really heavy on my lips, does not go on easily and feels dry too.</li>
            <li>I searched high and low to find one that would match my skin tone, and of course go with my daily outfits.  </li>
            <li>it definitely looks like a young color.</li>
            <li>This is the REAL Barbie Pink Lippy.</li>
            <li>but u definitely need to add a lip gloss or vasiline to give it a wet look with out those it&#x27;s very matted.</li>
            <li>The look is a classic pink.</li>
            <li>I usually like to keep everything simple, so purchasing this bright vivacious pink was a bit out of the ordinary.</li>
            <li>I love the shocking bright pink lipstick by wet n wild.</li>
            <li>I do have to reapply after I eat, but it does leave a nice little stain behind.</li>

            <li> I love this color.</li>
            <li> Probably not that great for older women</li>
            <li> One of the best colors they have loves how long it stays on your lips n</li>
            <li> I have many pink shades of lipsticks, but this one is the best!</li>
            <li> it gives just the right amount of sexiness without going over the top!</li>
            <li> the picture is very true to color.</li>
            <li> I wear a lot of neutral colors and this pink is perfect with everything.</li>
            <li> but because I opened it already &amp; have to make the best of it by combining this pink with a lighter one.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s wonderful Barbie doll pink without being shiny, so you don&#x27;t look like you smeared goo all over your face.</li>
            <li> Good Price, Fast Shipping.</li>
            <li> First of all, let me say that this Dollhouse Pink lipstick is a beautiful shade that enhances my medium coloring and reddish hair very nicely.</li>
            <li> The perfect pink lipstick!</li>
            <li> it applies smoothly and it comes naturally neat on lips nice color and its very cute</li>
            <li> i loved the color , but the lipstickwas kind of dry</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this lipstick it looks great.</li>
            <li> I came across this product and was so happy that I finally found the correct shade.  </li>
            <li> It goes on smooth &amp; after 2 coats the color</li>
            <li> Unless your lips are always moist and smooth and wrinkle free this lipstick is NOT for you.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as big as the picture,but I am happy with the product.</li>
            <li> The pink is fabulous and a beautiful texture.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s nice, colors a little bright, not an every day wear</li>
            <li> I bought it thinking it would be very matte because I love matter lipsticks, it was not that matte to me.</li>
            <li> Its very matte and cute color.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very noticable which is why I love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just glad that this color doesn&#x27;t stain my skin as much as the others.</li>
            <li> NOT BAD</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an absolutely beautiful and bright soft pink (it&#x27;s very bright but soft, not hot fuchsia!).</li>
            <li> Wet N Wild has gorgeous lip colors!!!</li>
            <li> and it is really bold</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not even a pink lipstick kind of person, but I love this color.</li>
            <li> This color is very cute and works on numerous skintones (</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very pretty color.</li>
            <li> Very pretty color--makes you feel like a princess.</li>
            <li> The application is very light and would need touch ups very frequently</li>
            <li> For me it&#x27;s kind of a strong pink</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so bright and pink.</li>
            <li> dollhouse pink is perfect, so ladylike, mature, and sexy at the same time!</li>
            <li> color is vibrant and even though its a matte lipstick it glides on easily.</li>
            <li> please it will be so worth it and also came a day befor</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re in search of a bright, yet wearable pink lipstick, go for this one!</li>
            <li> I think that it&#x27;s nice for what it is and the slight slope on the top of the cap really does it for</li>
            <li> Usually pinks do not show up against my natural lipcolor at all, but this goes on opaque and perfect.</li>
            <li> Wet &amp; wild did a good job of making this lipstick for a cheap price.</li>
            <li> I loved this lipstick really high pigments but the cap always slips off have to be super careful taking it off</li>
            <li> 6 days FREE shipping from California to New York?</li>
            <li> I love pink lipstick, and mostly light lipstick.  </li>
            <li> It goes on dry, so you have to use some kind of emollient on your lips before applying the lipstick.</li>
            <li> But over all it got to me fast and is exactly as it was explained!</li>
            <li> Nice pink but a little bright.  </li>
            <li> I am an avid user of higher end cosmetic brands</li>
            <li> this color looks pretty online</li>
            <li> Finally I&#x27;ve found my FAVORITE color.</li>
            <li> That, and the dryness, are the only reasons it gets 4 stars :)</li>
            <li> kinda long lasting also, great buy.</li>
            <li> as for the lipsticks, they are super highly pigmented.</li>
            <li> THEY HAVE GREAT PIGMENTATION AND LAST A REALLY LONG TIME !&lt;</li>
            <li> The color is a very bright pink, like a bubblegum pink.</li>
            <li> The shipping was pretty fast</li>
            <li> : It goes on very MATTE so chapstick or something before/after. ;-)</li>
            <li> beautiful color and stays on pretty long as well, plus the cheap price is a serious bonus too.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s really a pretty color, and any one who likes pink will love this shade..  </li>
            <li> It applies smoothly and stays on for hours, leaving a very pleasant pink stain behind.</li>
            <li> non the less, the amount should last me the entire year, so it was an excellent buy!</li>
            <li> Last Lip Color is a super product, if it meets your requirements for a matt-only lipcolor!</li>
            <li> You can apply more for going out or a special occasion, but I usually just apply some to my bottom lip and then press my lips together.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very matte color</li>
            <li> VERY MATTE VERY PIGMENTED.  </li>
            <li> really, really pops...</li>
            <li> its a sexy pink</li>
            <li> , all of these lipsticks are very slippery, if you will.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t apply and was very cakey.</li>
            <li> anyways it&#x27;s my favorite pink colored lipstick.</li>
            <li> its really more pink than you think it is.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a beautiful pink that compliments my dark skin tone very well.</li>
            <li> The color was MUCH brighter than I had anticipated.  </li>
            <li> I love the wet n wild lipsticks.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not thick.</li>
            <li> /move around so much during the application that I got some out of my natural lip line.</li>
            <li> look for wet n wild stick lip gloss for a good pink color.</li>
            <li> I received this a few days ago and I absolutely love it...</li>
            <li> As I began to put it on, I liked the color that was slowly appearing.</li>
            <li> Easy to tone down.</li>
            <li> The buyer will definitely get more bang for their buck with this pink.</li>
            <li> Make my lips super dry.</li>
            <li> Definitely a wild color!</li>
            <li> I have dark hair and light skin.</li>
            <li> Nowhere near it!</li>
            <li> /&gt;i got this product a day earlier and than estimated and its truely the same color as diplayed on the web.</li>
            <li> You literally only need to do one swipe or even dab it on and the color is so vibrant and the color is so vibrant.</li>
            <li> (Be aware that every Wet n Wild lipstick is particularly dry at first, but as you continue to rub the color against your lips it becomes much softer.)</li>
            <li> I would advise wearing a clear or neutral lip liner with it.</li>
            <li> WHERE YOU CAN SEE THESE IN ACTION</li>
            <li> /&gt;Secondly, if you purchase this Mega Last Lip Color understand that it is a very matt finish.</li>
            <li> and the problem was fixed</li>
            <li> Ordered this with another item both came in a timely fashion however it was old.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s dry though but that exactly what I likes about it .</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s VERY matte and boisterously pink, but if you put on just a little with some chapstick on top, it brings out my blue eyes!</li>
            <li> The pink is a pretty color though.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this color, though you will need a Chapstick or smooth base as it goes on very dry/matte.</li>
            <li> If you like hot pink that is!</li>
            <li> The description says &amp;#34;semi-matte,&amp;#34; which should be enough to tell you that it&#x27;s pretty dry.</li>
            <li> This lipstick feels really heavy on my lips, does not go on easily and feels dry too.</li>
            <li> I searched high and low to find one that would match my skin tone, and of course go with my daily outfits.  </li>
            <li> it definitely looks like a young color.</li>
            <li> This is the REAL Barbie Pink Lippy.</li>
            <li> but u definitely need to add a lip gloss or vasiline to give it a wet look with out those it&#x27;s very matted.</li>
            <li> The look is a classic pink.</li>
            <li> I usually like to keep everything simple, so purchasing this bright vivacious pink was a bit out of the ordinary.</li>
            <li> I love the shocking bright pink lipstick by wet n wild.</li>
            <li> I do have to reapply after I eat, but it does leave a nice little stain behind.</li>
            <li> Defiantly will last a long time because no layers or coats needed.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also a long lasting lipstick.</li>
            <li> Disappointed it doesn&#x27;t look good on me.</li>
            <li> It does make your lips dry a bit, but I always put on my eos chapstick prior to application anyway and that helps a lot.  </li>
            <li> I purchased the doll house pink, now I&#x27;m gonna purchase that deep red one.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s long lasting as well, though not as long lasting as some of the other colors.</li>
            <li> and  it&#x27;s stays for long time.</li>
            <li> I just bought this item from a local chain store &amp; it is definitely pink.</li>
            <li> (the \\&quot;Wet n Wile Mega Last Lip Color\\&quot; lipsticks, anyway).</li>
            <li> Also, it does not stay on as long as stated in the description.</li>
            <li> its a blue based pink.</li>
            <li> I usually buy mac Barbie pink, but am a little low on cash right now</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very pigmented, I just add a little lip balm because its a matte lipstick and can get a little drying.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not dark skin but not light skin</li>
            <li> I do agree with other reviewers that it goes on matte, though personally I prefer it matte</li>
            <li> but when I try it on it was  dry</li>
            <li> I thought it wasn&#x27;t that dry ...</li>
            <li> it look so dry on the lips.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t find it overly drying, either, though if you already have dry lips, it will show every bump.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a natural looking shade of pink.</li>
            <li> Would had gave it five stars but it a matte which can make your lips very dry.</li>
            <li> the formula is very dry.</li>
            <li> it makes your lips look very dry and streaky</li>
            <li> It matches well with my skin tone  and gives my lips a very subtle and  pretty pink.</li>
            <li> Was to Barbie pink for me.</li>
            <li> but this color is way brighter than expected.</li>
            <li> I wear it with a pink blush and a touch of pinkish highlighter under my brows and a navy eye liner.</li>
            <li> As we all know pink was the color for this summer.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t mean the product is old.</li>
            <li> and a little goes a LONG way.</li>
            <li> Took a little long to come in</li>
            <li> Other than that , works like a charm.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s Barbie pink just what I was looking for and it lasts all day!</li>
            <li> i bought this for a couple bucks at walgreens the other day.</li>
            <li> and i get home and realise that it is a SHOCKING bright pink.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Lipstick tube clicks tight to let you know that it&#x27;s closed, and it doesn&#x27;t come off for me when I travel with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pick</li>
            <li> i gave it to my daughter who is dark skinned</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just poor packaging on that part, but I still adore the clear top, and black base.</li>
            <li> i wear it everyday to work</li>
            <li> The vibrancy does tend to fade after a few hours, so I reapply as needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> its thick and not very comfortable to wear, the pink was very flashy.</li>
            <li> Blink Pink\\&quot; is the WORST so far; it leaves behind a horrible stain on the lips/skin but the pigmentation that you get beforehand is truly worth</li>
            <li> Delivery was expensive and slow..</li>
            <li> So just be wary of that, believe it or not I was not prepared for it to slide</li>
            <li> Lip stick creases and peels the lips :(</li>
            <li> so if you want a matte lipstick thats outrageous in color.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> its thick and not very comfortable to wear, the pink was very flashy.</li>
            <li> i wear it everyday to work i love the color cant wait to get some  more of them</li>
            <li> I love this color. It&#x27;s really is dollhouse pink, or Barbie pink. It&#x27;s so bright and pink. Just love it. Probably not that great for older women it definitely looks like a young color. It&#x27;s a very matte color so I&#x27;ll probably put a smear of gloss on it. It seems to last well. I lick my lips a lot and it didn&#x27;t move after that.</li>
            <li> Was to Barbie pink for me. I&#x27;m not dark skin but not light skin either if that helps</li>
            <li> I bought it thinking it would be very matte because I love matter lipsticks, it was not that matte to me. The pink is a pretty color though. I think it is a good buy.</li>
            <li> Definitely a wild color! Looks amazing with smokey eye makeup! üòçin love with this color!</li>
            <li> i love the matte look it perfert, and goes well with my caramel skin tone</li>
            <li> This is a terrific lipstick. The look is a classic pink. I wear a lot of neutral colors and this pink is perfect with everything. You can apply more for going out or a special occasion, but I usually just apply some to my bottom lip and then press my lips together. That is enough color for me. I would advise wearing a clear or neutral lip liner with it. Love this .</li>
            <li> This color is very cute and works on numerous skintones (me and my friends tried it on- it looked cute on all of us~)</li>
            <li> Great bold color. Goes on nicely and stays on unless you wipe your lips.</li>
            <li> Always getting comments when wearin. Would had gave it five stars but it a matte which can make your lips very dry. It last all day.</li>
            <li> I love the wet n wild lipsticks. I purchased three of them and glad I Did. They are very pretty and the colors are great.  And amazing for the price</li>
            <li> I love it. Its so beautiful. Makes your lips look fuller. Its great for the price. I will be buying this again..</li>
            <li> So i placed my order for two lipsticks on the 16th Jan, i recieved them today, - the 22nd jan. 6 days FREE shipping from California to New York? NOT BAD AT ALL! as for the lipsticks, they are super highly pigmented. I am an avid user of higher end cosmetic brands and i can honestly compare this range to the Clinique or Mac &amp;#34;matte&amp;#34; range of lipsticks, which run from $15-$45.&lt;br /&gt;i was taken aback by the ammount in the tube, i turned out the tube when i recieved it and it was about an inch and a quarter of lipstick, and its a thinner stick than most. non the less, the amount should last me the entire year, so it was an excellent buy!</li>
            <li> strips on my lips alot</li>
            <li> Its very matte and cute color. Its also BRIGHT and makes ur lips alittle chapped after you wear it so I suggest to put chapstick before and after use. But over all I like it and recomend the&amp;#34;Just peachy&amp;#34; lipstick also that comes from wet and wild (:</li>
            <li> This is a great lipstick . It&#x27;s very pigmented, I just add a little lip balm because its a matte lipstick and can get a little drying. Other than that , works like a charm. I can wear it most of the day without retouching. I would recommend this to anybody.</li>
            <li> This is the REAL Barbie Pink Lippy. It&#x27;s the perfect shade for summer. I do agree with other reviewers that it goes on matte, though personally I prefer it matte but if it&#x27;s bothersome then just use chapstick or maybelline baby lips in quenched. I guarantee you&#x27;ll love it! :)</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this lipstick it looks great. and  it&#x27;s stays for long time. it&#x27;s dry though but that exactly what I likes about it .</li>

            <li> The shipping was pretty fast but when I try it on it was  dry so you have to put lip gloss  that bothers me cause I thought it wasn&#x27;t that dry ...</li>

            <li> LOVE THESE LIPSTICKS THEY HAVE GREAT PIGMENTATION AND LAST A REALLY LONG TIME !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I HAVE THESE IN TEN DIFF SHADESS !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CHECK OUT MY YOUTUBE BEAUTY CHANNEL WHERE YOU CAN SEE THESE IN ACTION (kimkreations p)</li>
            <li> This color has been compared to MAC Candy Yum Yum but it&#x27;s about $10 cheaper! Wet N Wild has gorgeous lip colors!!!</li>
            <li> this color looks pretty online and it is really bold i gave it to my daughter who is dark skinned and she uses a purple liner before applying</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very pretty color. Disappointed it doesn&#x27;t look good on me. But over all it got to me fast and is exactly as it was explained!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this lipstick! It&#x27;s Barbie pink just what I was looking for and it lasts all day! I didn&#x27;t have to reapply it all day! I went to work, school and are and drank and it stayed on like I just put it on. I&#x27;m very impressed and it&#x27;s cheap!</li>
            <li> This is a very nice color. It&#x27;s strong and bright, it&#x27;s opaque, and it&#x27;s a perfect dupe to MAC&#x27;s Pink Nouveau, for an awesome price. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> The perfect pink lipstick!</li>
            <li> One of the best colors they have loves how long it stays on your lips n</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s VERY matte and boisterously pink, but if you put on just a little with some chapstick on top, it brings out my blue eyes! love it!</li>
            <li> VERY MATTE VERY PIGMENTED.  That I LOVE. .. but this color is way brighter than expected.</li>
            <li> Bought as Christmas gift.</li>
            <li> I seriously love this product. The pink is fabulous and a beautiful texture. I love how the color is noticeable on my lips</li>
            <li> I have dark hair and light skin. Finally I&#x27;ve found my FAVORITE color. It&#x27;s very noticable which is why I love it. Perfect. I&#x27;ll be buying it again.</li>
            <li> Great color.  would buy again</li>
            <li> üòç just the color that matches my skin it is so cute</li>
            <li> First of all, let me say that this Dollhouse Pink lipstick is a beautiful shade that enhances my medium coloring and reddish hair very nicely. I wear it with a pink blush and a touch of pinkish highlighter under my brows and a navy eye liner. Love it for a girley-girl mood!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Secondly, if you purchase this Mega Last Lip Color understand that it is a very matt finish. It&#x27;s not glossy. It doesn&#x27;t glide on and look like a sheer touch of color. Once you put this on, it stays on -- almost to the end of your day! Try using a lip brush for a nice effect, or you might want to try putting on a touch of moisture on your lips before application or after for a shinier look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Third -- the price is amazing for a product like this. This was only a couple of dollars at a discount/variety store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In essence, Wet n Wild Mega Last Lip Color is a super product, if it meets your requirements for a matt-only lipcolor! If you are looking for a shiny gloss, look elsewhere!</li>
            <li> As we all know pink was the color for this summer.  I searched high and low to find one that would match my skin tone, and of course go with my daily outfits.  I have many pink shades of lipsticks, but this one is the best! I came across this product and was so happy that I finally found the correct shade.  I get many compliments on this shade and plan to wear it even in the winter LOL! I will be purchasing again...dollhouse pink is perfect, so ladylike, mature, and sexy at the same time! It doesn&#x27;t give off the barbie appeal...it gives just the right amount of sexiness without going over the top! 2 thumbs up!</li>
            <li> I loveeeee it :) its to Die For üòò it applies smoothly and it comes naturally neat on lips nice color and its very cute im glad I found this , its everything</li>
            <li> I just bought this item from a local chain store &amp; it is definitely pink. For me it&#x27;s kind of a strong pink but because I opened it already &amp; have to make the best of it by combining this pink with a lighter one. Will I recommend this lipstick? I will it&#x27;s a beautiful color. Wet &amp; wild did a good job of making this lipstick for a cheap price. The color IS what is shown through the tube. It&#x27;s not thick. It feels creamy on the lips. It doesn&#x27;t cake up. It goes on smooth &amp; after 2 coats the color really, really pops... It may be considered a semi matte-ish lipstick. So you will need a lip gloss to achieve the ultimate shine finish. The buyer will definitely get more bang for their buck with this pink.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a lipstick were u don&#x27;t have to reapply every hour or several coats just to get some color on your lips and I found it. You literally only need to do one swipe or even dab it on and the color is so vibrant and the color is so vibrant. Defiantly will last a long time because no layers or coats needed.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this color, though you will need a Chapstick or smooth base as it goes on very dry/matte. It&#x27;s an absolutely beautiful and bright soft pink (it&#x27;s very bright but soft, not hot fuchsia!). YouTube has some great examples of the color.&lt;br /&gt;BUYER BEWARE: this lipstick costs .99$ in Walgreens. It&#x27;s a wonderful color, but way over priced on here. That, and the dryness, are the only reasons it gets 4 stars :)</li>
            <li> I loved this lipstick really high pigments but the cap always slips off have to be super careful taking it off</li>
            <li> Cute color good for it&#x27;s price</li>
            <li> Nice color but u definitely need to add a lip gloss or vasiline to give it a wet look with out those it&#x27;s very matted.</li>
            <li> color is vibrant and even though its a matte lipstick it glides on easily. kinda long lasting also, great buy. its a sexy pink</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a great color and it doesn&#x27;t clump on.</li>
            <li> Nice pink but a little bright.  Easy to tone down.</li>
            <li> I love the way this lipstick makes my lips look. It compliments my complexion and I just love it! I would recommend.</li>
            <li> Delivery was expensive and slow.. Lip stick creases and peels the lips :(</li>
            <li> I love pink lipstick, and mostly light lipstick.  This is another beautiful shade that I bought and I love to wear it, and it&#x27;s really a pretty color, and any one who likes pink will love this shade..  I love it, and am very happy with it.  Thank you!!!</li>
            <li> i loved the color , but the lipstickwas kind of dry so i just applied some lipgloss and the problem was fixed</li>
            <li> love ittttttttttttttttttttttttttt  colour is amazing but the container was abit shaking but its good</li>
            <li> No complaints, It works well and gives my lips a pop</li>
            <li> Make my lips super dry.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re in search of a bright, yet wearable pink lipstick, go for this one! It&#x27;s a steal! And unlike some of its cousins in the \\&quot;Wet n Wild Mega Last Lip Color\\&quot; line, it doesn&#x27;t leave such a noticeable stain on your lips after you take it off. It&#x27;s long lasting as well, though not as long lasting as some of the other colors. The pigmentation makes up for it, though! The vibrancy does tend to fade after a few hours, so I reapply as needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As all of the lipsticks under the \\&quot;Mega Last\\&quot; title, the caps do get messy fast, and the edges of the lipstick become damaged. Though this has NOTHING to do with the seller, all of the lipsticks are like that (the \\&quot;Wet n Wile Mega Last Lip Color\\&quot; lipsticks, anyway). It&#x27;s just poor packaging on that part, but I still adore the clear top, and black base. I think that it&#x27;s nice for what it is and the slight slope on the top of the cap really does it for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lipstick tube clicks tight to let you know that it&#x27;s closed, and it doesn&#x27;t come off for me when I travel with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pick yourself up a tube! It&#x27;s cheap, and the color payoff is amazing. It can be a bit drying though, but only a -bit-. It&#x27;s nothing like Mac&#x27;s Ruby Woo (I know the color isn&#x27;t the same, just a formula comparison). Nowhere near it! Talk about the Sahara Desert!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All of these lipsticks are FAIRLY matte. Though still shiny, so I honestly can&#x27;t see why they&#x27;re being considered to fall under the category of a \\&quot;matte lipstick,\\&quot; when they contain shine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, all of these lipsticks are very slippery, if you will. They slide around on your lips when applying (and yet the formula can also be drying at the same time. I know, I don&#x27;t understand it either!) and a little goes a LONG way. So just be wary of that, believe it or not I was not prepared for it to slide/move around so much during the application that I got some out of my natural lip line. I&#x27;m just glad that this color doesn&#x27;t stain my skin as much as the others. (\\&quot;Don&#x27;t Blink Pink\\&quot; is the WORST so far; it leaves behind a horrible stain on the lips/skin but the pigmentation that you get beforehand is truly worth the stain afterwards).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-E</li>
            <li> Unless your lips are always moist and smooth and wrinkle free this lipstick is NOT for you. It goes on dry, so you have to use some kind of emollient on your lips before applying the lipstick. The color is a very bright pink, like a bubblegum pink. It&#x27;s not a natural looking shade of pink. Won&#x27;t be buying again.</li>
            <li> Ordered this with another item both came in a timely fashion however it was old. Couldn&#x27;t apply and was very cakey. If that is even a word.  Will wait and just buy in store next time.</li>
            <li> This lipstick feels really heavy on my lips, does not go on easily and feels dry too. Also, it does not stay on as long as stated in the description.</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE! Very pretty color--makes you feel like a princess. Watch a youtube review like I did and you&#x27;ll fall in love! Beware: It goes on very MATTE so chapstick or something before/after. ;-)</li>
            <li> love love love love love this color makes me feel dolled up when im out.&lt;br /&gt;i got this product a day earlier and than estimated and its truely the same color as diplayed on the web.</li>
            <li> I love the shocking bright pink lipstick by wet n wild. after i put it on, i have to put lip gloss on top of the lipstick. but before that I have to put lip balm on it, before i apply the lipstick. anyways it&#x27;s my favorite pink colored lipstick.</li>
            <li> i bought this for a couple bucks at walgreens the other day. and i get home and realise that it is a SHOCKING bright pink. the formula is very dry. and its matte on top of that. it makes your lips look very dry and streaky the product is a flop for me. i have it 2 stars because im sure its great for someone. just not me. its a blue based pink. so if you want a matte lipstick thats outrageous in color. then this is for you. the picture is very true to color. and it comes off just the same on the lips. its really more pink than you think it is.</li>
            <li> it look so dry on the lips. I would not recommend this product although i like the color. look for wet n wild stick lip gloss for a good pink color.</li>
            <li> Took a little long to come in but it&#x27;s nice, colors a little bright, not an every day wear but I&#x27;m happy with it</li>
            <li> The application is very light and would need touch ups very frequently</li>
            <li> Love the color day or nite looks nice I have gotten lots of complements and the price is perfect will continue to order</li>
            <li> Love this lipstick, It&#x27;s matte and it lasts &amp; lasts. I purchased the doll house pink, now I&#x27;m gonna purchase that deep red one. All I can say is I Love this lipstick. Great Purchase</li>
            <li> I am not one who wears lipstick often, although the 3 lipsticks I do have are Wet n Wild. I usually like to keep everything simple, so purchasing this bright vivacious pink was a bit out of the ordinary. Anyway, I just received it today and wanted to try it out. (Be aware that every Wet n Wild lipstick is particularly dry at first, but as you continue to rub the color against your lips it becomes much softer.) As I began to put it on, I liked the color that was slowly appearing. It matches well with my skin tone  and gives my lips a very subtle and  pretty pink. I definitely suggest it.</li>
            <li> Absolutely beautiful color!  If you like hot pink that is!</li>
            <li> To the people complaining that it&#x27;s waxy/dry: IT&#x27;S A MATTE. The description says &amp;#34;semi-matte,&amp;#34; which should be enough to tell you that it&#x27;s pretty dry. It doesn&#x27;t mean the product is old. Anyway, on to the actual review--&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are a buck or two at Walgreens, but the pigmentation is AWESOME. Usually pinks do not show up against my natural lipcolor at all, but this goes on opaque and perfect. I don&#x27;t find it overly drying, either, though if you already have dry lips, it will show every bump. Moisturize beforehand, or put some balm on first--though that sacrifices some of the matte finish. It&#x27;s wonderful Barbie doll pink without being shiny, so you don&#x27;t look like you smeared goo all over your face. I&#x27;m not even a pink lipstick kind of person, but I love this color. It applies smoothly and stays on for hours, leaving a very pleasant pink stain behind. Love it and will so purchase again.</li>
            <li> i love this lipstick just got it ben killing the hell out of it it so pretty it goes great  with my brown skin tone amazing five paws up lol thank u buy this lipstick please it will be so worth it and also came a day befor time packaged great came so clean and everbody hating on me when opened it asking to try lol thanks buy</li>
            <li> I received this a few days ago and I absolutely love it...It goes on very smooth you&#x27;ll just need lip balm or lip gloss with it.</li>
            <li> Love the color absolutely beautiful Thanks again</li>
            <li> Item as described. Fast shipping</li>
            <li> I love this color. It&#x27;s a beautiful pink that compliments my dark skin tone very well. It&#x27;s also a long lasting lipstick. It&#x27;s not as big as the picture,but I am happy with the product. I am ordering every color asap</li>
            <li> The color was MUCH brighter than I had anticipated.  It does make your lips dry a bit, but I always put on my eos chapstick prior to application anyway and that helps a lot.  I do have to reapply after I eat, but it does leave a nice little stain behind.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t stay on all day but I only have to reapply once or twice a day.  The pigment is great.</li>
            <li> Great color . Especially for us brown skinned girls üòò</li>
