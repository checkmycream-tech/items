            <li>This is a really good product.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s good at \\&quot;volumizing\\&quot;</li>
            <li>Place\\&quot;  also did a wonderful job with packing and mailing the items quickly.</li>
            <li>Love the product which is no longer produced!</li>
            <li>This foam is great for fine flyaway hair.  </li>
            <li>This is a nice product.</li>
            <li>Place\\&quot;  and was delighted to have been able to find it.  </li>
            <li>Good product :]</li>
            <li>I love Aveeno products and have been using the Nourish &amp; Volume Shampoo</li>
            <li>I love that this product is a pump not an aerosol (for environmental reasons).</li>
            <li>This is an outstanding product and has always been my favourite hair-conditioning and styling product.  </li>
            <li>Love this product, and cannot find it in the stores, so glad that u carry it,.</li>
            <li>An excellent product which works well especially for those who do not care for aerosol canned mouse.</li>
            <li>It gives it body and texture and feels like I have a lot more hair.  </li>
            <li>It also helps it take a better curl and hold it.  </li>
            <li>Soft and manageable hair with great body and hold.</li>
            <li>Love how this product is light, just strong for its weight and claims to nourish my hair while holding?  </li>
            <li>But this foam is light and airy and my hair styles well with it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not at all greasy and that&#x27;s important to me.</li>
            <li>I also got their clarifying shampoo and it is fantastic too.  </li>
            <li>It gives my white gold locks a boost and great shine.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never found anything else with this light of weight.</li>
            <li>It adds volume without stickiness while providing a light leave in conditioner.</li>
            <li>It may have lost some of it&#x27;s \\&quot;foamy-ness\\&quot;, not too sure since this is my first time using this product.</li>
            <li>I originally found it on a clearance rack at the grocery store and when I ran out I tried the web and voila there</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t dry my hair and gives me good volume.</li>
            <li>so far, it&#x27;s my favorite hair styling product.</li>
            <li>I am so glad that I was able to purchase several bottles on Amazon and will probably purchase several more just to have.</li>
            <li>As far as the product goes, I love how \\&quot;natural\\&quot; it is, and not all gooey and sticky in my hair.</li>
            <li>I am 62 years old with very fine hair and unfortunately not a lot of it.  </li>
            <li>I apply it right after my shower, before I blowdry, and it seems to help my curling efforts stay put (after hairspray too).</li>
            <li>Too bad that Johnson &amp; Johnson has chosen again to discontinue another excellent product; hopefully, they are replacing it with something better, and sometimes not or not all e.g.: their Rainbath bar soap, or their original First Aid Cream that was made with bees wax, etc.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been stockpiling it because I don&#x27;t see it in my local stores any more.</li>
            <li>;D</li>
            <li>I have thrown out many mousse products because they go flat.</li>
            <li>This is a wonderful very light product for very fine and thin short pixie cut hair with a small amount of curl.</li>
            <li>My fault for not realizing I live in the desert, and it gets hot in those mail boxes!</li>
            <li>This stuff has a nice hold to it without weighing down your hair.</li>
            <li>I also have very fine hair and not much of it, and this product does wonders for it.  </li>
            <li>For my hair it gives me body, and so easy to style with my short hair.</li>
            <li>This sell got me these products in lightening fast time from this seller.</li>
            <li>Very flexible too, can style it.</li>
            <li>This volumizing foam is light, I only use 3 squirts, and not sticky.  </li>
            <li>Shipping was fast and it came wrapped in plastic wrap and tied with a twist tie and did not leak at all.</li>
            <li>(my hair is naturally straight).</li>
            <li>Smells really fresh and natural too, my hair looks like it has no product in it but smooths and controls</li>
            <li>You do not need much.</li>
            <li>I have been looking for something easy to throw in my hair every day to give it a little more volume and keep it from getting that plastered-to-my-face look, and this one finally hit the mark!  </li>
            <li>I noticed a dramatic difference in my hair when I didn&#x27;t use it and was not at all happy.</li>
            <li>One of my new must-have beauty items!</li>
            <li>I guess my fine and rather dry hair needed a little more in the way of holding, because it just didn&#x27;t hold up for me.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t really call your product natural when it has a bunch of chemicals and is tested on animals/isn&#x27;t cruelty-free.</li>
            <li>I have very fine soft hair and putting heavy product in it just won&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>ok - not a strong fragrance.</li>
            <li>It will never go flat because it begins as a liquid first.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair that doesn&#x27;t do well with gels or mousses -- too heavy and sticky for my hair.</li>
            <li>and I get a little body and a perfectly smooth finish</li>
            <li>The only thing is my conditioner has oils in it so my hair will get a little more oily if I use the foam afterwards.</li>
            <li>Keeps my hair soft and natural looking while giving it the boost it needs.  </li>
            <li>It brings out the natural wave in one&#x27;s hair and has an  airy-finish, leaving the hair soft and clean-looking and always in shape.  </li>
            <li>Thankfully I didn&#x27;t order this in July, or I&#x27;d really have nothing left!</li>
            <li>Keeps hair in place while keeping it soft.</li>
            <li>Try [...] for chemical hazard ratings in common beauty products to find safe alternatives.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely helped keep it lighter (it&#x27;s been a while since its last cut) and kept it looking fresh.  </li>
            <li>Have used this for a few years now and like many older products, it is getting harder to find</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know what I will do when there is no more available.</li>
            <li>I have very fine, rather thin hair.</li>
            <li>My hair has natural wave &amp; is generally pretty cooperative with styling but needs something to give it a little \\&quot;tooth\\&quot;</li>
            <li>- I love that it&#x27;s a foam, so it&#x27;s never too heavy or goopy; I just pump some out, mess it through my hair, and go.  </li>
            <li>It lasts a long time (I need two shallow pumps for my chin-length hair); it smells nice (though the fragrance is a little stronger than I might prefer); and so long as I don&#x27;t use too much, it doesn&#x27;t get sticky.</li>

            <li> I have been using this volumizing foam for a few years and then it was discontinued.</li>
            <li> so I had gone a few months without.</li>
            <li> Left my shoulder-length, thin and somewhat oily hair brittle.  </li>
            <li> Does not leave any residue and does not leave your hair stiff and crusty like some mousse products.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not glue-y and doesn&#x27;t dull my hair,</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair and usually find hair products that clump and/ or look greasy.</li>
            <li> Air drying made it worse.</li>
            <li> Sadly  Aveeno  discontinued this product (Aveeno - Nourish and Style Volumizing Foam)  </li>
            <li> This was a disappointment as I use Aveeno shampoo and conditioner and body products.</li>
            <li> Smell is very faint.</li>
            <li> Too bad its discontinued.</li>
            <li> - how stupid of them !!</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Aveeno Nourish &amp; Style Foam since it came out on the market and so far, it&#x27;s my favorite hair styling product. I have fine hair that doesn&#x27;t do well with gels or mousses -- too heavy and sticky for my hair. But this foam is light and airy and my hair styles well with it. I&#x27;ve been stockpiling it because I don&#x27;t see it in my local stores any more.</li>
            <li> Great stuff!!  I love Aveeno products and have been using the Nourish &amp; Volume Shampoo so I decided to try the Volumizing foam. It&#x27;s great stuff!!  Keeps my hair soft and natural looking while giving it the boost it needs.  This product works great with the shampoo!!!</li>
            <li> This is a nice product. Doesn&#x27;t dry my hair and gives me good volume. It&#x27;s not at all greasy and that&#x27;s important to me.</li>
            <li> I love that this product is a pump not an aerosol (for environmental reasons). I apply it right after my shower, before I blowdry, and it seems to help my curling efforts stay put (after hairspray too). Its smells ok - not a strong fragrance.</li>
            <li> This hair product is amazing! Does not leave any residue and does not leave your hair stiff and crusty like some mousse products. Soft and manageable hair with great body and hold. It will never go flat because it begins as a liquid first. I have thrown out many mousse products because they go flat. Aveeno is great! I wouldn&#x27;t use anything else!</li>
            <li> I have been looking for something easy to throw in my hair every day to give it a little more volume and keep it from getting that plastered-to-my-face look, and this one finally hit the mark!  I use it all the time now - I love that it&#x27;s a foam, so it&#x27;s never too heavy or goopy; I just pump some out, mess it through my hair, and go.  It&#x27;s definitely helped keep it lighter (it&#x27;s been a while since its last cut) and kept it looking fresh.  One of my new must-have beauty items!</li>
            <li> There is no information regarding the ingredients listed in the add for this foam, but they include wheat gluten, which is a major problem for quite a few people &amp; should definitely be listed in the ad. I have to go through the trouble to return this now, because I will not eat gluten nor wear it in my beauty products. In my opinion, it was irresponsible not to provide this info.</li>
            <li> This is a really good product.  I didn&#x27;t even know Aveeno made shampoos!  I also got their clarifying shampoo and it is fantastic too.  This sell got me these products in lightening fast time from this seller. A+++++&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!!!</li>
            <li> This is an outstanding product and has always been my favourite hair-conditioning and styling product.  It brings out the natural wave in one&#x27;s hair and has an  airy-finish, leaving the hair soft and clean-looking and always in shape.  Sadly  Aveeno  discontinued this product (Aveeno - Nourish and Style Volumizing Foam)  - how stupid of them !!&lt;br /&gt;Fortunately I managed to buy some stock of this  from Amazon&#x27;s  vendor  \\&quot;The Family Place\\&quot;  and was delighted to have been able to find it.  \\&quot;The Family Place\\&quot;  also did a wonderful job with packing and mailing the items quickly.</li>
            <li> I have been using this volumizing foam for a few years and then it was discontinued. I couldn&#x27;t find it locally in any stores so I had gone a few months without. I noticed a dramatic difference in my hair when I didn&#x27;t use it and was not at all happy. I am so glad that I was able to purchase several bottles on Amazon and will probably purchase several more just to have. I don&#x27;t know what I will do when there is no more available. They sell a much more expensive version at Nordstrom for about $35, I do not want to resort to that!</li>
            <li> Just wanted to note that when I received this item, the liquid somewhat leaked out of the bottle. My fault for not realizing I live in the desert, and it gets hot in those mail boxes! Thankfully I didn&#x27;t order this in July, or I&#x27;d really have nothing left! It may have lost some of it&#x27;s \\&quot;foamy-ness\\&quot;, not too sure since this is my first time using this product. As far as the product goes, I love how \\&quot;natural\\&quot; it is, and not all gooey and sticky in my hair. Very flexible too, can style it. The only thing is my conditioner has oils in it so my hair will get a little more oily if I use the foam afterwards. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s good at \\&quot;volumizing\\&quot;, I don&#x27;t blow dry my hair. Good product :]</li>
            <li> Love this product, and cannot find it in the stores, so glad that u carry it,. For my hair it gives me body, and so easy to style with my short hair.</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair and usually find hair products that clump and/ or look greasy. This product lasts and does not leave any residue as well as allowing for successful styling.</li>
            <li> Left my shoulder-length, thin and somewhat oily hair brittle.  Did not help with styling and felt Ike I had witch hair after brilliant drying. Air drying made it worse. This was a disappointment as I use Aveeno shampoo and conditioner and body products.</li>
            <li> Have used this for a few years now and like many older products, it is getting harder to find so I looked to Amazon and bought it here.&lt;br /&gt;Recommend to others.</li>
            <li> An excellent product which works well especially for those who do not care for aerosol canned mouse. Too bad that Johnson &amp; Johnson has chosen again to discontinue another excellent product; hopefully, they are replacing it with something better, and sometimes not or not all e.g.: their Rainbath bar soap, or their original First Aid Cream that was made with bees wax, etc.</li>
            <li> Too bad its discontinued. I originally found it on a clearance rack at the grocery store and when I ran out I tried the web and voila there it was.</li>
            <li> Great substitute for mouse. Can&#x27;t find in stores, discontinued.</li>
            <li> I am 62 years old with very fine hair and unfortunately not a lot of it.  This volumizing foam is light, I only use 3 squirts, and not sticky.  It gives my white gold locks a boost and great shine.  Aveeno had a wonderful product and should not have discontinued it.</li>
            <li> I also am very impressed with this product.  I have allergies to a lot of hair products, which leave my scalp itching or irritated, and this does neither.  I also have very fine hair and not much of it, and this product does wonders for it.  It gives it body and texture and feels like I have a lot more hair.  It also helps it take a better curl and hold it.  This is a great find for me and I hope I can continue to order it from Amazon.  Shipping was fast and it came wrapped in plastic wrap and tied with a twist tie and did not leak at all.</li>
            <li> This foam is great for fine flyaway hair.  It makes my hair shiny &amp; controls frizz without weighing it down.</li>
            <li> I guess my fine and rather dry hair needed a little more in the way of holding, because it just didn&#x27;t hold up for me.</li>
            <li> I have very fine, rather thin hair. I use this before blowing my hair dry and I get a little body and a perfectly smooth finish (my hair is naturally straight). It lasts a long time (I need two shallow pumps for my chin-length hair); it smells nice (though the fragrance is a little stronger than I might prefer); and so long as I don&#x27;t use too much, it doesn&#x27;t get sticky.</li>
            <li> Keeps hair in place while keeping it soft. Makes it look a little thicker. The other one I was using was Nexxus and it compares well to that but costs less.</li>
            <li> Love how this product is light, just strong for its weight and claims to nourish my hair while holding?  The future is upon us! ;D</li>
            <li> I have very fine soft hair and putting heavy product in it just won&#x27;t work. This stuff has a nice hold to it without weighing down your hair. I&#x27;ve never found anything else with this light of weight. Smells really fresh and natural too, my hair looks like it has no product in it but smooths and controls like I need it to.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Nourish &amp; Style for a couple of years.  My hair has natural wave &amp; is generally pretty cooperative with styling but needs something to give it a little \\&quot;tooth\\&quot; so the hair stays on the styling brush while I&#x27;m blow drying it.  This product fits the bill perfectly.  It adds volume without stickiness while providing a light leave in conditioner.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful very light product for very fine and thin short pixie cut hair with a small amount of curl. Smell is very faint. You do not need much.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t really call your product natural when it has a bunch of chemicals and is tested on animals/isn&#x27;t cruelty-free. Try [...] for chemical hazard ratings in common beauty products to find safe alternatives.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not really very foamy. Therefore an even distribution is somewhat problematic. It&#x27;s not glue-y and doesn&#x27;t dull my hair, so well... so-so overall.</li>
            <li> Love the product which is no longer produced!</li>
