            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Zoe Reneir Facial Moisturizer for about a month and love it!</li>
            <li>This best moisturizer contains Papaya extracts which enhances the sloughing off of dead skin cells leaving room for new ones producing an even skin tone</li>

            <li>major difference this moisturizer has over others is that many of the ingredients are from marine, seaweed, and algae extracts.</li>
            <li>I haver used a countless number of facial moisturizers and this one by far is the best.</li>
            <li>Hexapeptide-8 is sort of like &amp;#34;mini Botox&amp;#34; in that it stops the muscles under the skin from reacting to repeated facial movements like frowning and smiling to smooth fine lines and wrinkles.</li>

            <li>because I know people really count on honesty in reviews to help them make a buying choice.</li>

            <li>I really like this Moisturizer.</li>
            <li>She loves it, she said it soaks into her skin fast with no greasy feeling at all.</li>
            <li>not only moisturizer well but are made with healthy, natural ingredients and this aloe vera mosturizier</li>
            <li>Zoe Ren&amp;eacute;ir&#x27;s Face Moisturizer is vegan (the main draw for me!), cruelty-free, and free of parabens, and rich in vitamins A, E, and C Ester; green tea; Gotu Kola; Papaya; botancial Grapeseed oil; and Jojoba oil.</li>
            <li>It is so soft and I love the light scent, it&#x27;s not overwhelming and perfumy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light, goes on smoothly, absorbs well, and does not feel heavy even under my make-up!</li>
            <li>I have been using AHAVA products as of late which are good but more for hydration and less for anti aging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Aloe Vera is a natural moisturizer used to heal many dry or irritated skin conditions.</li>
            <li>This moisturizer is lightly scented and the cream goes a long way.</li>
            <li>This moisturizer is lightly scented and the cream goes a long way.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I&#x27;d say that it&#x27;s a nice lightweight vegan moisturizer; it hydrates the skin, but I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;d recommend it as a firming treatment, since I didn&#x27;t see any results on that front.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Leaves your skin very soft and moisturized!</li>
            <li>THAT WAS HIGHLY MOISTURIZED.</li>
            <li>formula is good for the skin, containing almost three dozen helpful ingredients, from jojoba seed oil to salicylic acid and from hyaluronic acid to vitamin E.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients:  Organic Aloe barbadensis leaf extract, purified water, octyl stearate, sorbitol, methylsulfonylmethane (MSM), grapeseed seed oil, organic ginseng root extract, glyceryl stearate, alpha lipoic acid, hyaluronic acid, soluble marine collagen, soluble marine elastin, sea buckthorn, salicylic acid, jojoba seed oil, kukui nut oil, organic red seaweed extract, organic algae extract, organic gotu kola extract, organic echinacea extract, organic green tea leaf extract, organic papaya fruit extract, organic camu camu extract, mangosteen peel extract, organic acai extract, vitamin A, vitamin E, ascorbic acid, calcium ascorbate, panthenol, glycerin, stearyl alcohol, stearic acid, phenoxyethanol, ethylhexylglycerin, natural</li>
            <li>Alpha Lipoic acid benefits known for its powerful antioxidant property with free radical age fighting strength combined with green tea, jojoba oil, vitamins A, E, C Ester and grapeseed oil for face along with other ultra rich herbal nutrients will boost collagen and elastin production.</li>
            <li>I tend to be normal to oily in the summer</li>
            <li>My skin is now softer and brighter, also I&#x27;m noticing my &amp;#34;laugh lines&amp;#34; becoming less noticeable.</li>
            <li>Besides being paraben-free (which is very important to me), it&#x27;s formulated with all natural products like aloe, green tea, papaya, encinachea, and acai.  </li>
            <li>Any moisturizer that can keep my mid-sixty year old face moisturized for the entire day, in the dry heat of the southwest dry desert area is pretty remarkable, especially since the temperature is over 100 degrees every</li>
            <li>I live in Hawaii and am always in the sun.</li>
            <li>I have sensitize skin and am allergic to a lot of products, so I am reluctant to try new moisturizers, but I have had no problems with Zoe Reneir.  </li>
            <li>It gives a quenching sensation without making your face feel heavy, and it doesn&#x27;t require aggressive movements to completely massage into your face, like so many others.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My daughter has very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>No heavy feeling of a moisturizer on your face, it absorbs right into the skin and begins to work instantly.</li>
            <li>I received this cream at a discounted price for an honest review and, if I felt it was not good for my skin, I would have said so.</li>
            <li>I received this cream at a discounted price for an honest review and, if I felt it was not good for my skin, I would have said so.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m excited to see what other changes will occur over time.</li>
            <li>I bought this item for the first time recently.  </li>
            <li>I am still pretty young, mid-twenties, but my face is starting to see signs of aging.</li>
            <li>I am happy to say that it helped with the places on my face that are dry without making the oily parts worse.</li>
            <li>I even have some discolored spots that are hardly noticeable now:)</li>
            <li>When you open the box, the basic instructions for use are on the inside of the top flap which are essentially to apply a small amount to a clean face in upward strokes morning</li>
            <li>It is white, viscous, and has a very neutral vegetal fragrance from the natural botanical</li>
            <li>And I definitely would highly recommend!</li>
            <li>It makes my face feel so soft after applying......</li>
            <li>and my face feels so soft.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m also a busy mom, and don&#x27;t have time to spend applying tons of products in layers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I for one have sensitive skin .&lt;br</li>
            <li>A lot of them make my skin feel greasy since my skin is naturally oily.</li>
            <li>always appreciate any skin product that uses natural and organic, plant and herbal extracts that nourish the skin, rather than the chemical compound ingredients that often result in skin</li>
            <li>In addition, these ingredients provide skin with natural nourishing agents to heal and help reverse the damaging effects that our skin cells have suffered over time.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Glycerin – natural skin softener&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The directions are marked in the inside lid of the box as well as the bottle itself.</li>
            <li>The directions are marked in the inside lid of the box as well as the bottle itself.  </li>
            <li>When they described it as velvety soft, they were not kidding.  </li>
            <li>I totally recommend this product to anyone that has some flaws on their skin that&#x27;s wants to see a difference....</li>
            <li>The most common is sunburn.</li>
            <li>The Moisturizer leaves my skin feeling smother and very firm, I love this product and will continue using it as my daily moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Left my 40 year old face feeling soft and refreshed!</li>
            <li>cream comes in a pretty purple box with a sparkly sticker to keep it closed.</li>
            <li>Other seaweeds retain water in its plant tissue, similar to the our skin’s epidermis ability to hold water, this ensures that the seaweed stays plump and moisturized in low tide, in the same manner that our own skin needs to remain moisturized in the dry air.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was very apprehensive about trying this product since I do not have dry skin.</li>
            <li>As soon as I received this I washed my face because I really wanted to try this moisturizer for dry skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Disclaimer I received this in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.&gt;The jar that it came in is clear and makes it look expensive</li>
            <li>and that is only 4 days of using it so far!  </li>
            <li>My experience is that it goes on easily and absorbs quickly, without leaving my skin feeling greasy or dirty.</li>
            <li>I found that it&#x27;s a decent moisturizer - not the best vegan lotion I&#x27;ve ever tried, but also not the worst - and generally gets the job done.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;ve been searching for a natural moisturizer for daily use, give this one</li>
            <li>It left my skin moisturized and feeling soft.</li>
            <li>It left my skin moisturized and feeling soft.  </li>
            <li>That is a plus in my book, because most moisturizers make the oily places so much worse</li>
            <li>Because I was using other creams and testing serums, I wasn&#x27;t able to use this cream twice daily everyday</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s advertised as an all-over face moisturizer for those with normal to dry skin; those with oily skin are directed to use it solely as a firming treatment around the eyes.</li>
            <li>It claims to be a 30 day supply, but could be less depending on how much cream you use to cover your face.</li>
            <li>I am a redhead with dry sensitive skin and when I was introduced to Zoe</li>
            <li>Very thick, but goes on light an not greasy.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very small jar, so applying it morning and night will use it up quickly.</li>

            <li> lotion has a slight perfume-y scent, kind of flowery, that&#x27;s mild and rather pleasant.</li>
            <li> I apply Zoe morning and night, and even after a 16 hour shift my skin still looks like I just put fresh makeup on!</li>
            <li> Super quick shipping also!</li>
            <li> This is best for normal to dry skin.</li>
            <li> WAS A TRUE TREASURE, BEING</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Zoe Reneir Facial Moisturizer for about a month and love it!</li>
            <li> This best moisturizer contains Papaya extracts which enhances the sloughing off of dead skin cells leaving room for new ones producing an even skin tone</li>
            <li> Super luxurious-feeling moisturizer that absorbs right into your skin.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a really nice creme with hardly even a scent to it which is great for anyone who is sensitive to smells.</li>
            <li> I have never had the success I have with this one.</li>
            <li> MSM enables the nutrients and botanical extracts to be absorbed deeper into skin layers giving another boost to plumbing out creases.</li>
            <li> have begun  to see a fresh and smoother look to my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> love the natural ingredients Ihat will not in any&lt;br /&gt;way</li>
            <li> This aloe vera based moisturizer is great for dry to normal skin.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer is effective as it helps skin to attract and retain the moisture that is generally lost during the day, and this hydration helps to prevent the fine lines that form as we naturally age.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;There are no major health concerns for most people with any of the ingredients, and the product is cruelty free.</li>
            <li> major difference this moisturizer has over others is that many of the ingredients are from marine, seaweed, and algae extracts.</li>
            <li> I haver used a countless number of facial moisturizers and this one by far is the best.</li>
            <li> Hexapeptide-8 is sort of like &amp;#34;mini Botox&amp;#34; in that it stops the muscles under the skin from reacting to repeated facial movements like frowning and smiling to smooth fine lines and wrinkles.</li>
            <li> Acetyl Hexapeptide-8 is sort of like &amp;#34;mini Botox&amp;#34; in that it stops the muscles under the skin from reacting to repeated facial movements like frowning and smiling to smooth fine lines and wrinkles.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer is effective for a smoother texture, superior hydration, and it successfully diminishes the tell-tale fine lines, which reveals a younger appearance than the general expectations for my age.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a Free sample for an evaluation; my information is from multiple internet sites, and the statements regarding my personal results, along with my opinions are my own.s a younger appearance than the general expectations for my age.  </li>
            <li> WHEN I JUST FOUND ONE GREAT ONE THAT IS BOTH UNIVERSAL TO MY DAILY SKIN CARE ROUTINE,</li>
            <li> &gt; Proudly created in the U.S., this fantastic vegan best facial moisturizer is free of nasty parabens, no added fragrances, and colors.</li>

            <li> Thanks for making such a nice product.</li>
            <li> Thanks, Zoe Reneir, for making such an amazing product that does exactly what you say it will do.</li>
            <li> AFTER TRIAL OF THE PRODUCT, I AM VERY SURPRISED BY ITS RESULTS IN JUST 3 DAYS!!!</li>
            <li> I have used it twice daily now for one month and am very pleased with how soft my skin has become.</li>
            <li> After my morning application, my face is still hydrated, soft and smooth at the end of our hot and drying day.</li>
            <li> Acid, (Vitamin C)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Calcium Ascorbate - essential nutrient that plays a pivotal role in the body&#x27;s collagen production, tissue repair.</li>

            <li> However, I love that it absorbs almost instantly and doesn&#x27;t leave a sticky or greasy residue on my face.</li>
            <li> I love how it feels as if you did not even put any on, yet the benefits remain obvious.  </li>
            <li> This is an excellent cream for someone whose skin is normal - even to a little oily - and just starting to age.  </li>
            <li> My skin looks good, feels hydrated, and some fine lines look less noticeable or not as deep.</li>
            <li> Ever since I started using this my face and his stays hydrated and refreshing all day long.</li>
            <li> Its scent is like cream, not perfume (which I can&#x27;t stand), and it is rich but at the same time absorbs immediately so I can go to sleep or apply makeup right away without waiting for it to eventually sink in.</li>

            <li> I don&#x27;t often wear makeup, but I&#x27;m fairly certain that this moisturizer would function well under foundation and the like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> I have been using this product now for a couple months exactly as directed: very little at a time on a damp face, and I love it!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any changes in my skin tone, fine lines and wrinkles, or overall appearance during the month that I used it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t expect any cream to actually make my fine lines vanish but</li>

            <li> It comes in an attractive little jar and is packaged in an upscale blue box (just add a bow!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this Zoe Reneir moisturizer for about 10 days, and I really like it a lot.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light enough that it doesn&#x27;t give me a headache from the smell.</li>
            <li> It plumps and hydrates very well with zero greasiness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The cream melts into the skin and is intensely moisturizing without feeling greasy.  </li>
            <li> It improved so much that I have received unprovoked comments mentioning my &#x27;glow&#x27;.</li>
            <li> I NOTICED THAT THIS PRODUCT REALLY HELPED TO SOOTHE MY SKIN AND SEEMED TO BE AN &amp;#34;ERASER&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> but really the price is reasonable.</li>
            <li> It is lightweight and creamy that massages in real niceley.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> It is lightweight and creamy that massages in real niceley.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much milder but is noticeable.</li>
            <li> This ingredient along with all the others makes this cream really stand out for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> because I know people really count on honesty in reviews to help them make a buying choice.</li>

            <li> I really like this Moisturizer.</li>
            <li> She loves it, she said it soaks into her skin fast with no greasy feeling at all.</li>
            <li> not only moisturizer well but are made with healthy, natural ingredients and this aloe vera mosturizier</li>
            <li> Zoe Ren&amp;eacute;ir&#x27;s Face Moisturizer is vegan (the main draw for me!), cruelty-free, and free of parabens, and rich in vitamins A, E, and C Ester; green tea; Gotu Kola; Papaya; botancial Grapeseed oil; and Jojoba oil.</li>
            <li> It is so soft and I love the light scent, it&#x27;s not overwhelming and perfumy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light, goes on smoothly, absorbs well, and does not feel heavy even under my make-up!</li>
            <li> I have been using AHAVA products as of late which are good but more for hydration and less for anti aging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Aloe Vera is a natural moisturizer used to heal many dry or irritated skin conditions.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer is lightly scented and the cream goes a long way.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer is lightly scented and the cream goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;d say that it&#x27;s a nice lightweight vegan moisturizer; it hydrates the skin, but I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;d recommend it as a firming treatment, since I didn&#x27;t see any results on that front.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Leaves your skin very soft and moisturized!</li>
            <li> THAT WAS HIGHLY MOISTURIZED.</li>
            <li> formula is good for the skin, containing almost three dozen helpful ingredients, from jojoba seed oil to salicylic acid and from hyaluronic acid to vitamin E.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients:  Organic Aloe barbadensis leaf extract, purified water, octyl stearate, sorbitol, methylsulfonylmethane (MSM), grapeseed seed oil, organic ginseng root extract, glyceryl stearate, alpha lipoic acid, hyaluronic acid, soluble marine collagen, soluble marine elastin, sea buckthorn, salicylic acid, jojoba seed oil, kukui nut oil, organic red seaweed extract, organic algae extract, organic gotu kola extract, organic echinacea extract, organic green tea leaf extract, organic papaya fruit extract, organic camu camu extract, mangosteen peel extract, organic acai extract, vitamin A, vitamin E, ascorbic acid, calcium ascorbate, panthenol, glycerin, stearyl alcohol, stearic acid, phenoxyethanol, ethylhexylglycerin, natural</li>
            <li> Alpha Lipoic acid benefits known for its powerful antioxidant property with free radical age fighting strength combined with green tea, jojoba oil, vitamins A, E, C Ester and grapeseed oil for face along with other ultra rich herbal nutrients will boost collagen and elastin production.</li>
            <li> I tend to be normal to oily in the summer</li>
            <li> My skin is now softer and brighter, also I&#x27;m noticing my &amp;#34;laugh lines&amp;#34; becoming less noticeable.</li>
            <li> Besides being paraben-free (which is very important to me), it&#x27;s formulated with all natural products like aloe, green tea, papaya, encinachea, and acai.  </li>
            <li> Any moisturizer that can keep my mid-sixty year old face moisturized for the entire day, in the dry heat of the southwest dry desert area is pretty remarkable, especially since the temperature is over 100 degrees every</li>
            <li> I live in Hawaii and am always in the sun.</li>
            <li> I have sensitize skin and am allergic to a lot of products, so I am reluctant to try new moisturizers, but I have had no problems with Zoe Reneir.  </li>
            <li> It gives a quenching sensation without making your face feel heavy, and it doesn&#x27;t require aggressive movements to completely massage into your face, like so many others.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My daughter has very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> No heavy feeling of a moisturizer on your face, it absorbs right into the skin and begins to work instantly.</li>
            <li> I received this cream at a discounted price for an honest review and, if I felt it was not good for my skin, I would have said so.</li>
            <li> I received this cream at a discounted price for an honest review and, if I felt it was not good for my skin, I would have said so.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m excited to see what other changes will occur over time.</li>
            <li> I bought this item for the first time recently.  </li>
            <li> I am still pretty young, mid-twenties, but my face is starting to see signs of aging.</li>
            <li> I am happy to say that it helped with the places on my face that are dry without making the oily parts worse.</li>
            <li> I even have some discolored spots that are hardly noticeable now:)</li>
            <li> When you open the box, the basic instructions for use are on the inside of the top flap which are essentially to apply a small amount to a clean face in upward strokes morning</li>
            <li> It is white, viscous, and has a very neutral vegetal fragrance from the natural botanical</li>
            <li> And I definitely would highly recommend!</li>
            <li> It makes my face feel so soft after applying......</li>
            <li> and my face feels so soft.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also a busy mom, and don&#x27;t have time to spend applying tons of products in layers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I for one have sensitive skin .&lt;br</li>
            <li> A lot of them make my skin feel greasy since my skin is naturally oily.</li>
            <li> always appreciate any skin product that uses natural and organic, plant and herbal extracts that nourish the skin, rather than the chemical compound ingredients that often result in skin</li>
            <li> In addition, these ingredients provide skin with natural nourishing agents to heal and help reverse the damaging effects that our skin cells have suffered over time.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Glycerin – natural skin softener&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The directions are marked in the inside lid of the box as well as the bottle itself.</li>
            <li> The directions are marked in the inside lid of the box as well as the bottle itself.  </li>
            <li> When they described it as velvety soft, they were not kidding.  </li>
            <li> I totally recommend this product to anyone that has some flaws on their skin that&#x27;s wants to see a difference....</li>
            <li> The most common is sunburn.</li>
            <li> The Moisturizer leaves my skin feeling smother and very firm, I love this product and will continue using it as my daily moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Left my 40 year old face feeling soft and refreshed!</li>
            <li> cream comes in a pretty purple box with a sparkly sticker to keep it closed.</li>
            <li> Other seaweeds retain water in its plant tissue, similar to the our skin’s epidermis ability to hold water, this ensures that the seaweed stays plump and moisturized in low tide, in the same manner that our own skin needs to remain moisturized in the dry air.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was very apprehensive about trying this product since I do not have dry skin.</li>
            <li> As soon as I received this I washed my face because I really wanted to try this moisturizer for dry skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Disclaimer I received this in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.&gt;The jar that it came in is clear and makes it look expensive</li>
            <li> and that is only 4 days of using it so far!  </li>
            <li> My experience is that it goes on easily and absorbs quickly, without leaving my skin feeling greasy or dirty.</li>
            <li> I found that it&#x27;s a decent moisturizer - not the best vegan lotion I&#x27;ve ever tried, but also not the worst - and generally gets the job done.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve been searching for a natural moisturizer for daily use, give this one</li>
            <li> It left my skin moisturized and feeling soft.</li>
            <li> It left my skin moisturized and feeling soft.  </li>
            <li> That is a plus in my book, because most moisturizers make the oily places so much worse</li>
            <li> Because I was using other creams and testing serums, I wasn&#x27;t able to use this cream twice daily everyday</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s advertised as an all-over face moisturizer for those with normal to dry skin; those with oily skin are directed to use it solely as a firming treatment around the eyes.</li>
            <li> It claims to be a 30 day supply, but could be less depending on how much cream you use to cover your face.</li>
            <li> I am a redhead with dry sensitive skin and when I was introduced to Zoe</li>
            <li> Very thick, but goes on light an not greasy.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very small jar, so applying it morning and night will use it up quickly.</li>
            <li> texture is about halfway between thin and thick; thin enough that I can apply it quickly and with minimum effort, but still rich enough that it does an adequate job of hydrating my skin.</li>
            <li> moisturizer is creamy, and absorbs immediately without any greasy residue, it is highly concentrated so a couple of little dabs is sufficient for face and neck coverage.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m constantly trying to find a moisturizer that works on my dry skin, one that won&#x27;t take multiple applications a day, to get the moisture your looking for.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I only like using natural products such as this because it don&#x27;t contain harsh ingredients that will cause breakouts.</li>
            <li> This is a very soft moisturizer and blends easliy with little effort.  </li>
            <li> I definitely recommend this Moisturizer For Dry Skin from Zoe Reneir.</li>
            <li> I have really dry skin on my face especially during winter.</li>
            <li> Organic Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract, Purified Water, Octyl Stearate, Sorbitol, Methylsulfonylmethane (MSM), Grapeseed Seed Oil, Organic Ginseng Root Extract, Glyceryl Stearate, Alpha Lipoic Acid, Hyaluronic Acid, Soluble Marine Collagen, Soluble Marine Elastin, Sea Buckhorn, Salicylic Acid, Jojoba Seed Oil, Kukui Nut Oil, Organic Red Seaweed Extract, Organic Algae Extract, Organic Gotu Kola Extract, Organic Enchinacea Extract, Organic Green Tea Leaf Extract, Organic Papaya Fruit Extract, Organic Camu Camu Extract, Mangosteen Peel Extract, Organic Acai Extract, Vitamin A, Vitamin E, Ascorbic Acid, Calcium Ascorbate, Panthenol, Glycerin, Stearyl Alcohol, Stearic Acid, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexglycerin, Natural Fragrance.</li>
            <li> This Face Moisturizer is very concentrated and only takes a small amount to make my face and neck feel extremely hydrated.  </li>
            <li> so I cannot yet tell you the long term effects.</li>
            <li> It allows you to use a minimal amount with no residue left on face.  </li>
            <li> My boyfriend and I both suffer from dry flakey skin on our face ,we tried a thousand different moisturizers and nothing seemed to work, the moisture would last for a little bit then</li>
            <li> However, my skin becomes almost comically dry in the winter, and I have my doubts regarding its ability to hold up under those</li>
            <li> I WENT FROM HAVING DRY SKIN</li>
            <li> you know our face was dry and eyebrows were flakey again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Ideal for morning and evening applications, this dry skin treatment for dry flaky skin on face will be welcomed by its soothing delivery.</li>
            <li> Every product I have used either leaves a film on my skin or takes a lot at once to do away with the dry feeling.</li>
            <li> i have extremely dry skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s got a very faint botanical fragrance, soaks in quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feel, although my skin does feel moisturized and soft.  </li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way, especially when applied to the problem areas around the eyes and mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Whether it will work well for my dry, 73-year-old skin remains to be seen!</li>
            <li> moisturizer by Zoe Ren&amp;eacute;ir has a creamy white consistency and is so concentrated that just two or three small finger pats is enough to cover both the face and neck.</li>
            <li> Note that such comments are certainly not business as usual, seeing as I&#x27;m a dude in his mid 20&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I am little over 35 year  and need an ANTI- AGING formula  to keep skin looking softer and younger.</li>
            <li> the size of a grape is about enough to do it - my skin feels quenched for the day (or at least until its next encounter with water).</li>
            <li> The cream itself is white and thick but fluffy, not heavy or greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have dry, middle aged skin and over the last few years I&#x27;ve gotten serious about keeping my skin exfoliated, moisturized and cared for.  </li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I have tried various moisturizers in the past and after a week or two they would start to irritate my face or make my face look oily, but this product does not</li>
            <li> /&gt;After applying it to my face everyday, twice a day (after morning and evening showers) for ~40 days (this is how long my 1oz jar lasted)</li>
            <li> The crow&#x27;s feet there are less hideous.</li>
            <li> You can still do all those things of course but the result is less noticeable wrinkling and creasing.</li>
            <li> You can still do all those things of course but the result is less noticeable wrinkling and creasing.</li>
            <li> I typically look for moisturizers that</li>
            <li> so all you need is a little</li>
            <li> A little drooping her, a little bit of wrinkles there, and a few lines on my forehead.</li>
            <li> The consistency is not overly thick like other &amp;#34;anti aging&amp;#34; creams, nor is it greasy like typical off the shelf brands.</li>
            <li> jar that it came in is clear and makes it look expensive</li>
            <li> this is my round the clock moisturizer.</li>
            <li> It has tightened her skin, and diminished the appearance of wrinkles, it knocked off a few years off of her in about 3 days.</li>
            <li> A peptide extracted from the single-celled green algae stimulates production of four types of dermal collagen and elastin.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy I found this moisturizer!  I&#x27;m in love with this high quality creme.  I&#x27;ve used it for 3 weeks now &amp; of course it gets 5 stars!  Its refreshing &amp; has  a clean - not overwhelming scent. I&#x27;ve tried various brands, but this Zoe Aloe Vera moisturizer is a Must Have!  To me, this is the most important beauty tool. And I definitely would highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Great product......I love it. It makes my face feel so soft after applying......A little bit goes a long way. I&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product. I use it twice daily and my face feels so soft. It&#x27;s light weight and non greasy. Love it and will recommend to my friends...Thanks</li>
            <li> Just ordered our 2nd bottle.  This moisturizer is silky smooth &amp; hydrating on my face.  A great product to incorporate into your daily skin care regime!</li>
            <li> I have dry, middle aged skin and over the last few years I&#x27;ve gotten serious about keeping my skin exfoliated, moisturized and cared for.  I&#x27;m also a busy mom, and don&#x27;t have time to spend applying tons of products in layers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this Zoe Reneir moisturizer for about 10 days, and I really like it a lot.  Besides being paraben-free (which is very important to me), it&#x27;s formulated with all natural products like aloe, green tea, papaya, encinachea, and acai.  All of the ingredients are known to regenerate skin cells, are anti-oxidant, stimulate blood flow, and moisturize.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this cream twice a day after cleansing, smoothing it on my face, neck and upper chest.  It&#x27;s got a very faint botanical fragrance, soaks in quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feel, although my skin does feel moisturized and soft.  My daughter has very sensitive skin and she&#x27;s been using it too - without any redness or allergic reaction.  I don&#x27;t normally wear makeup, but my daughter says she was able to apply her makeup over top of this moisturizer without having it all slide off her face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 1 ounce jar should last months based on the amount I need for each application.  The jar is pretty too, and looks good sitting on my vanity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is a very moisturizing cream made with top quality natural ingredients -  and most importantly it&#x27;s made without *harmful* ingredients.  If you&#x27;ve been searching for a natural moisturizer for daily use, give this one a try!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a discounted jar of Zoe Reneir Moisturizer for testing and review purposes.  I wasn&#x27;t asked to leave a positive review, nor was I compensated in any way for offering my honest opinion of the product.</li>
            <li> I have an oily t-zone. I was very apprehensive about trying this product since I do not have dry skin. I have been using this product now for a couple months exactly as directed: very little at a time on a damp face, and I love it! It keeps my entire face moisturized throughout the day and I have no issues with my t-zone. It makes my face feel silky smooth, makes my skin tone more even, and keeps me feeling refreshed all day. And it is what it says: LIGHTWEIGHT! No heavy feeling of a moisturizer on your face, it absorbs right into the skin and begins to work instantly. The scent is amazing! It&#x27;s not overpowering with perfume smells. It&#x27;s light enough that it doesn&#x27;t give me a headache from the smell. I have told all my friends about this moisturizer. This is definitely a product I will continue to use. Thanks, Zoe Reneir, for making such an amazing product that does exactly what you say it will do.</li>
            <li> I work outside on my job and i dont wear foundation. This aloe Vera face moisturizer protects my face from the weather conditions keepng my face well hydrated. It goes on smooth with a light feel, and absorbs quickly... this is my round the clock moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Thank you  for letting me try this it feel so light</li>
            <li> Great moisturizer!! Very pleasant scent and easy to apply. My skin looks amazing.</li>
            <li> I live in Hawaii and am always in the sun. My skin has taken a beating for 30+ years and my neck and chest could use a good moisturizer. So when I was offered this Aloe Based Advanced Hydrating Firmer from Zoe Reneir for a great deal to try and share my honest opinion about it, I had to order it. It arrived and I only planned on using it on my neck and chest because I don&#x27;t want my face to break out like it always does. I&#x27;ve been using it for about a week now and my skin is looking and feeling great. It is so soft and I love the light scent, it&#x27;s not overwhelming and perfumy. I definitely recommend this Moisturizer For Dry Skin from Zoe Reneir.</li>
            <li> This is a very soft moisturizer and blends easliy with little effort.  I have used it twice daily now for one month and am very pleased with how soft my skin has become.</li>
            <li> I love this product!  I have sensitize skin and am allergic to a lot of products, so I am reluctant to try new moisturizers, but I have had no problems with Zoe Reneir.  It feels great on my skin, and I would definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li> Zoe Ren&amp;eacute;ir&#x27;s Face Moisturizer is vegan (the main draw for me!), cruelty-free, and free of parabens, and rich in vitamins A, E, and C Ester; green tea; Gotu Kola; Papaya; botancial Grapeseed oil; and Jojoba oil. It comes in an attractive little jar and is packaged in an upscale blue box (just add a bow!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s advertised as an all-over face moisturizer for those with normal to dry skin; those with oily skin are directed to use it solely as a firming treatment around the eyes. I fall somewhere in the middle, with combination skin. My experience is that it goes on easily and absorbs quickly, without leaving my skin feeling greasy or dirty. I don&#x27;t often wear makeup, but I&#x27;m fairly certain that this moisturizer would function well under foundation and the like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The texture is about halfway between thin and thick; thin enough that I can apply it quickly and with minimum effort, but still rich enough that it does an adequate job of hydrating my skin. I found that it&#x27;s a decent moisturizer - not the best vegan lotion I&#x27;ve ever tried, but also not the worst - and generally gets the job done. After I apply the moisturizer - a dollop about 1/2 the size of a grape is about enough to do it - my skin feels quenched for the day (or at least until its next encounter with water). However, my skin becomes almost comically dry in the winter, and I have my doubts regarding its ability to hold up under those conditions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lotion has a slight perfume-y scent, kind of flowery, that&#x27;s mild and rather pleasant. However, those with olfactory sensitivities might not be too keen on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While the moisturizer is also touted to &amp;#34;improve skin tone and elasticity&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;revitalize youthful-looking skin,&amp;#34;  I didn&#x27;t notice any changes in my skin tone, fine lines and wrinkles, or overall appearance during the month that I used it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;d say that it&#x27;s a nice lightweight vegan moisturizer; it hydrates the skin, but I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;d recommend it as a firming treatment, since I didn&#x27;t see any results on that front.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;** Full disclosure: I received a deeply discounted product in exchange for an honest review. **e I didn&#x27;t see any results on that front.  ** Full disclosure: I received a deeply discounted product in exchange for an honest review. **</li>
            <li> Great moisturizer! Absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy. Leaves your skin very soft and moisturized!</li>
            <li> I finally have found the best face moisturizer that goes on smooth and light. I have been looking for an organic unscented product and this is perfect.</li>
            <li> I received this at a reduced cost to provide an honest product review.&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is great and I will continue to order!  Left my 40 year old face feeling soft and refreshed!</li>
            <li> I love this product. I have tried various moisturizers in the past and after a week or two they would start to irritate my face or make my face look oily, but this product does not and it feels great and I love the way it makes my skin feel.  Another plus is that I can wear this under make up and I can actually use it daily. Great product!</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re skeptical about products like these, I don&#x27;t blame you, but please do give this cream a shot. I gave this to my mother in law, and she and the family have noticed a huge difference in her skin. It has tightened her skin, and diminished the appearance of wrinkles, it knocked off a few years off of her in about 3 days. The cream needs to be applied AM and PM every day. It claims to be a 30 day supply, but could be less depending on how much cream you use to cover your face. Overall the quality of this exceeded my expectations, it is vegan made, and no harmful testing has been done to any animals. The best part? It works. Take my word for it, order a bottle, and you&#x27;ll realize how much younger you will look. All of the amazon reviewers have posted pics of their results.. why not be another one of those happy customers? My mother in law is very happy!</li>
            <li> This anti aging creme has a lightweight feel to it once applied. It&#x27;s a really nice creme with hardly even a scent to it which is great for anyone who is sensitive to smells. As for the anti aging part it to soon for me to notice, but I love the creme! I received this product at a reduced price to give my honest opinion.</li>
            <li> This is very light for what it does. It plumps and hydrates very well with zero greasiness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are no major health concerns for most people with any of the ingredients, and the product is cruelty free. This is an excellent cream for someone whose skin is normal - even to a little oily - and just starting to age.  Women who have a bit more life experience might want or need something a bit heavier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Five stars for women in their 30s-40s. Easy four-and-a-half stars for women 50+.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* the manufacturer provided a sample for purposes of testing and review&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;** ingredients: Organic Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract, Purified Water, Octyl Stearate, Sorbitol, Methylsulfonylmethane (MSM), Grapeseed Seed Oil, Organic Ginseng Root Extract, Glyceryl Stearate, Alpha Lipoic Acid, Hyaluronic Acid, Soluble Marine Collagen, Soluble Marine Elastin, Sea Buckhorn, Salicylic Acid, Jojoba Seed Oil, Kukui Nut Oil, Organic Red Seaweed Extract, Organic Algae Extract, Organic Gotu Kola Extract, Organic Enchinacea Extract, Organic Green Tea Leaf Extract, Organic Papaya Fruit Extract, Organic Camu Camu Extract, Mangosteen Peel Extract, Organic Acai Extract, Vitamin A, Vitamin E, Ascorbic Acid, Calcium Ascorbate, Panthenol, Glycerin, Stearyl Alcohol, Stearic Acid, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexglycerin, Natural Fragrance.</li>
            <li> This facial moisturizer comes in a 1 oz. (30 ml) jar. It is white, viscous, and has a very neutral vegetal fragrance from the natural botanical ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is pleasant to use.  The cream melts into the skin and is intensely moisturizing without feeling greasy.  A little bit goes a long way, especially when applied to the problem areas around the eyes and mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regular use will reduce the appearance of fine wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The formula is good for the skin, containing almost three dozen helpful ingredients, from jojoba seed oil to salicylic acid and from hyaluronic acid to vitamin E.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients:  Organic Aloe barbadensis leaf extract, purified water, octyl stearate, sorbitol, methylsulfonylmethane (MSM), grapeseed seed oil, organic ginseng root extract, glyceryl stearate, alpha lipoic acid, hyaluronic acid, soluble marine collagen, soluble marine elastin, sea buckthorn, salicylic acid, jojoba seed oil, kukui nut oil, organic red seaweed extract, organic algae extract, organic gotu kola extract, organic echinacea extract, organic green tea leaf extract, organic papaya fruit extract, organic camu camu extract, mangosteen peel extract, organic acai extract, vitamin A, vitamin E, ascorbic acid, calcium ascorbate, panthenol, glycerin, stearyl alcohol, stearic acid, phenoxyethanol, ethylhexylglycerin, natural fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Zoe Ren&amp;eacute;ir provided moisturizer for evaluation and review.</li>
            <li> I tried this product because I spend a lot of time outside in the elements. It is an amazing product and I will&lt;br /&gt;purchase again. Thanks!!</li>
            <li> This lotion is expertly composed and strikes the perfect balance of texture and hydration. The consistency is not overly thick like other &amp;#34;anti aging&amp;#34; creams, nor is it greasy like typical off the shelf brands. It gives a quenching sensation without making your face feel heavy, and it doesn&#x27;t require aggressive movements to completely massage into your face, like so many others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After applying it to my face everyday, twice a day (after morning and evening showers) for ~40 days (this is how long my 1oz jar lasted) my complexion has noticeably improved. It improved so much that I have received unprovoked comments mentioning my &#x27;glow&#x27;. Note that such comments are certainly not business as usual, seeing as I&#x27;m a dude in his mid 20&#x27;s. In addition I have been applying anti aging face lotion every day for ~8 years, so my complexion wasn&#x27;t terrible to begin with. I have never had the success I have with this one. Even the much more expensive brands I&#x27;ve imported from France, or bought at Nordstroms were as effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m confident that supplementing a healthy lifestyle with Zoe Reneir&#x27;s face moisturizer I will maintain the gift of youth for many years to come.</li>
            <li> Very nicely packaged as a gift for my wife (without any gift wrap ordered!). My wife say the cream is light and goes on well and she loves the organic ingredients.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS PRODUCT &amp; FEEL LIKE I JUST FOUND A TREASURE FOR MY SKIN!! I RECIEVED THIS PRODUCT AT A DISCOUNTED RATE IN EXCHANGE FOR MY HONEST, UNBIASED REVIEW. AFTER TRIAL OF THE PRODUCT, I AM VERY SURPRISED BY ITS RESULTS IN JUST 3 DAYS!!! I WENT FROM HAVING DRY SKIN TO HAVING A FACE THAT WAS HIGHLY MOISTURIZED. THE BEST PART IS I KNEW WHAT I WAS APPLYING TO MY FACE WAS A TRUE TREASURE, BEING THAT IS PRODUCT IS VEGAN, GLUETEN, PARABEN &amp; CRUELTY FREE. THIS PRODUCT IS FILLED WITH EXOTIC BONTANCIAL OILS &amp; HERBAL EXTRACTS &amp; IS MADE IN THE USA. YOU CAN WEAR THIS PRODUCT ALONE OR UNDER MAKEUP, WHICH MEANS NO MORE BUYING 2 PRODUCTS WHEN I JUST FOUND ONE GREAT ONE THAT IS BOTH UNIVERSAL TO MY DAILY SKIN CARE ROUTINE, AS WELL AS MY NIGHT TIME ROUTINE.  I NOTICED THAT THIS PRODUCT REALLY HELPED TO SOOTHE MY SKIN AND SEEMED TO BE AN &amp;#34;ERASER&amp;#34; TO MY FINE LINES AND WRINKLES. VERY MUCH IMPRESSED WITH PRODUCT, HIGHLY RECOMMENDED, WE WILL BE ORDERING THIS PRODUCT AGAIN! THANK YOU! :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients&lt;br /&gt;Organic Aloe Barbade</li>
            <li> As soon as I received this I washed my face because I really wanted to try this moisturizer for dry skin. My boyfriend and I both suffer from dry flakey skin on our face ,we tried a thousand different moisturizers and nothing seemed to work, the moisture would last for a little bit then next thing you know our face was dry and eyebrows were flakey again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This moisturizer is amazing I apply it in the morning and night and use as part of my facial cleansing regimen. Ever since I started using this my face and his stays hydrated and refreshing all day long. The good part is I can apply my makeup on top after my face is dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a light scent, which smells good, its diluted so all you need is a little dab.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;includes 10% Acetyl Hexapeptide-8 to minimize formation of unsightly lines and wrinkles we all dread. MSM enables the nutrients and botanical extracts to be absorbed deeper into skin layers giving another boost to plumbing out creases. Alpha Lipoic acid benefits known for its powerful antioxidant property with free radical age fighting strength combined with green tea, jojoba oil, vitamins A, E, C Ester and grapeseed oil for face along with other ultra rich herbal nutrients will boost collagen and elastin production. This helps in protecting the good skin and restores damaged skin conditions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ideal for morning and evening applications, this dry skin treatment for dry flaky skin on face will be welcomed by its soothing delivery. This best moisturizer contains Papaya extracts which enhances the sloughing off of dead skin cells leaving room for new ones producing an even skin tone complexion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Proudly created in the U.S., this fantastic vegan best facial moisturizer is free of nasty parabens, no added fragrances, and colors. Animal testing free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only like using natural products such as this because it don&#x27;t contain harsh ingredients that will cause breakouts. I for one have sensitive skin .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The jar that it came in is clear and makes it look expensive but really the price is reasonable. It has excellent quality to it. It is lightweight and creamy that massages in real niceley.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My face been thanking me ever since I started using it because of it staying hydrated, rejuvenated, flawless, glowing, and youthful looking. Since using I experienced less embarrassing dryness and flakes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer I received this in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.&gt;The jar that it came in is clear and makes it look expensive but really the price is reasonable.

            <li> I haver used a countless number of facial moisturizers and this one by far is the best. A lot of them make my skin feel greasy since my skin is naturally oily. I apply Zoe morning and night, and even after a 16 hour shift my skin still looks like I just put fresh makeup on! I will never use a different moisturizer. I have even got friends and coworkers hooked.</li>
            <li> Any moisturizer that can keep my mid-sixty year old face moisturized for the entire day, in the dry heat of the southwest dry desert area is pretty remarkable, especially since the temperature is over 100 degrees every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This moisturizer by Zoe Ren&amp;eacute;ir has a creamy white consistency and is so concentrated that just two or three small finger pats is enough to cover both the face and neck. After my morning application, my face is still hydrated, soft and smooth at the end of our hot and drying day. Then I reapply in the evenings to re-nourish my skin overnight, which provides smoother and brighter skin texture the following morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I always appreciate any skin product that uses natural and organic, plant and herbal extracts that nourish the skin, rather than the chemical compound ingredients that often result in skin irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The major difference this moisturizer has over others is that many of the ingredients are from marine, seaweed, and algae extracts. Researchers have found ways to use vitamin-and-mineral-rich marine extracts to fight signs of aging and to treat and repair many types of problem skin conditions. A peptide extracted from the single-celled green algae stimulates production of four types of dermal collagen and elastin. Other seaweeds retain water in its plant tissue, similar to the our skin’s epidermis ability to hold water, this ensures that the seaweed stays plump and moisturized in low tide, in the same manner that our own skin needs to remain moisturized in the dry air.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some of the key ingredients that I have listed below have anti-oxidant (therefore anti-aging), anti-bacterial, anti-inflammatory properties. In addition, these ingredients provide skin with natural nourishing agents to heal and help reverse the damaging effects that our skin cells have suffered over time. This moisturizer is effective as it helps skin to attract and retain the moisture that is generally lost during the day, and this hydration helps to prevent the fine lines that form as we naturally age.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ZOE REN&amp;Eacute;IR’S KEY MOISTURIZER INGREDIENTS:&lt;br /&gt;Organic Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract,&lt;br /&gt;Methylsulfonylmethane (MSM),&lt;br /&gt;Grape seed Oil,&lt;br /&gt;Organic Ginseng Root Extract,&lt;br /&gt;Hyaluronic Acid,&lt;br /&gt;Soluble Marine Collagen,&lt;br /&gt;Soluble Marine Elastin,&lt;br /&gt;Sea Buckhorn,&lt;br /&gt;Jojoba Seed Oil,&lt;br /&gt;Kukui Nut Oil,&lt;br /&gt;Organic Red Seaweed Extract,&lt;br /&gt;Organic Algae Extract,&lt;br /&gt;Organic Gotu Kola Extract,&lt;br /&gt;Organic Echinacea Extract,&lt;br /&gt;Organic Green Tea Leaf Extract,&lt;br /&gt;Organic Papaya Fruit Extract,&lt;br /&gt;Organic Camu Camu Extract,&lt;br /&gt;Mangosteen Peel Extract,&lt;br /&gt;Organic Acai Extract,&lt;br /&gt;Vitamin A,&lt;br /&gt;Vitamin E&lt;br /&gt;Ascorbic Acid, (Vitamin C)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Calcium Ascorbate - essential nutrient that plays a pivotal role in the body&#x27;s collagen production, tissue repair. It functions as an antioxidant - anti-aging benefits including building collagen, defending the skin against free-radicals, healing inflammations, reducing the appearance of fine lines &amp; wrinkles and lightening discolorations. It also conditions the skin, controls the pH level and preserves a finished product by slowing the possibility of deterioration caused by exposure to the air.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Glycerin – natural skin softener&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion, the addition of seaweed, sea kelp, and algae offer superior hydration as well as anti-aging and anti-inflammatory benefits. The combination of the marine base extracts along with the natural and organic plant nourishing properties helps to improve skin tone, skin texture, and elasticity resulting in healthy and youthful skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Anti-Aging Face Moisturizer from Zoe Ren&amp;eacute;ir is a vegan product, Paraben-free, without any added fragrances or colors, also created here in the US, cruelty-free, therefore not tested on animals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This moisturizer is creamy, and absorbs immediately without any greasy residue, it is highly concentrated so a couple of little dabs is sufficient for face and neck coverage. This moisturizer is effective for a smoother texture, superior hydration, and it successfully diminishes the tell-tale fine lines, which reveals a younger appearance than the general expectations for my age.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a Free sample for an evaluation; my information is from multiple internet sites, and the statements regarding my personal results, along with my opinions are my own.s a younger appearance than the general expectations for my age.

            <li> This cream goes on smoothly and smells good. Whether it will work well for my dry, 73-year-old skin remains to be seen! It&#x27;s a very small jar, so applying it morning and night will use it up quickly.</li>
            <li> Update November 10, 2015: I have been using this cream along with others since I wrote this review. I like the results I have gotten although I haven&#x27;t seen dramatic changes. My skin looks good, feels hydrated, and some fine lines look less noticeable or not as deep. I see results mostly around my eyes when I smile. The crow&#x27;s feet there are less hideous. Because I was using other creams and testing serums, I wasn&#x27;t able to use this cream twice daily everyday but I will buy it again and will when the time comes in a month or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am an anti aging cream and serum fanatic. I am always looking for new and better products especially as I approach the 50 year mark. I use Retin A which is fabulous but dries my skin out quite a bit. I need hydration as well as all the good stuff like antioxidants, This cream is the latest one I am trying to see if it will be my one and only. I have been using AHAVA products as of late which are good but more for hydration and less for anti aging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cream comes in a pretty purple box with a sparkly sticker to keep it closed. Cute. When you open the box, the basic instructions for use are on the inside of the top flap which are essentially to apply a small amount to a clean face in upward strokes morning and/or night. The jar is a one ounce one which I thought was small until I applied the cream and realized I needed very little to get the hydration I wanted. The cream itself is white and thick but fluffy, not heavy or greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this cream exclusively for a few days so I cannot yet tell you the long term effects. That is why I rated 4 stars instead of 5. However, I love that it absorbs almost instantly and doesn&#x27;t leave a sticky or greasy residue on my face. It instantly adds hydration and softens my skin. It also plumps my skin a bit and fine lines appear somewhat filled in and softened. If I apply the cream at night, I wake up with smooth hydrated skin. During the day, I can wear it under my make up and keeps my face nicely hydrated all day and skin sort of glows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Acetyl Hexapeptide-8 is sort of like &amp;#34;mini Botox&amp;#34; in that it stops the muscles under the skin from reacting to repeated facial movements like frowning and smiling to smooth fine lines and wrinkles. It takes a while to kick in. You can still do all those things of course but the result is less noticeable wrinkling and creasing. I used to use another (very expensive) cream that contained the ingredient and it did a nice job without freezing my face like Botox would. It&#x27;s much milder but is noticeable. This ingredient along with all the others makes this cream really stand out for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t expect any cream to actually make my fine lines vanish but the ingredients in this one are well known to help aging skin look its best. I am going to continue to use it exclusively as my moisturizing cream until the jar is gone and then will update this review to let you know how my skin looks after a number of weeks using this cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far, I am really happy with it. Its scent is like cream, not perfume (which I can&#x27;t stand), and it is rich but at the same time absorbs immediately so I can go to sleep or apply makeup right away without waiting for it to eventually sink in. I received this cream at a discounted price for an honest review and, if I felt it was not good for my skin, I would have said so. I don&#x27;t pull punches especially when it comes to products like this because I know people really count on honesty in reviews to help them make a buying choice. I certainly do. I will be back soon to update  this review as the weeks go by and I see how my skin fares. Right now, I am quite pleased and would purchase this again at full price.nicely hydrated all day and skin sort of glows.  Acetyl Hexapeptide-8 is sort of like &amp;#34;mini Botox&amp;#34; in that it stops the muscles under the skin from reacting to repeated facial movements like frowning and smiling to smooth fine lines and wrinkles. It takes a while to kick in. You can still do all those things of course but the result is less noticeable wrinkling and creasing. I used to use another (very expensive) cream that contained the ingredient and it did a nice job without freezing my face like Botox would. It&#x27;s much milder but is noticeable.

            <li> I am still pretty young, mid-twenties, but my face is starting to see signs of aging. A little drooping her, a little bit of wrinkles there, and a few lines on my forehead. I am always looking for something that will help me at least slow down the ravages of time. This moisturizer feels really nice on my skin. It soaks in easily and does not make my face feel or look oily or greasy. I am happy to say that it helped with the places on my face that are dry without making the oily parts worse. That is a plus in my book, because most moisturizers make the oily places so much worse so I just have to skip those areas. I have semi-sensitive skin and this did not aggravate my skin at all. No red marks, no pimples, no burning sensation. I was given the chance to test and give my honest opinion on this product during a promotion.</li>
            <li> This is nice moisturizer. Nice texture and very, very light scent. This is best for normal to dry skin. I tend to be normal to oily in the summer so I used this as an eye cream the night after I tried it as a face cream and really liked it better that way. Either way it gives your skin good moisture and firms it up a little.&lt;br /&gt;Sample provided</li>
            <li> Very nice face cream. I would n9t have tried it if I hadn&#x27;t gotten a promotion to try it for free!! Very smooth going on and not greasy at all!</li>
            <li> OOOHH my gosh. I love this creme!! It&#x27;s light weight. Odor free. And goes along way. It&#x27;s become an everyday thing for me to use and it&#x27;s hard to find a product you can trust. It&#x27;s great! Thank you.</li>
            <li> I received this moisture cream as a promotion for a Honest review.&lt;br /&gt;It comes in a 1oz beautifully package jar.  Been using for 3 weeks now, day n evening and have enough to finish out the month. Very thick, but goes on light an not greasy.  Skin stays moisturized all day alone or under makeup.&lt;br /&gt;I have begun  to see a fresh and smoother look to my skin.&lt;br /&gt;This is a excellent all natural product that I will use again!</li>
            <li> I have really dry skin on my face especially during winter. Every product I have used either leaves a film on my skin or takes a lot at once to do away with the dry feeling. I snuck my wife&#x27;s product called Zoe and &amp;#34;secretly loved it&amp;#34;.  It allows you to use a minimal amount with no residue left on face.  Strongly recommended even for guys.</li>
            <li> A very good skin moisturizer that absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy look or feel to my skin. Will definitely keep using this product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for only a week now and I have already felt a difference in my skin. I really like this Moisturizer. I purchased this product at a great discount. I&#x27;m very glad that I had the chance to get this. I&#x27;m constantly trying to find a moisturizer that works on my dry skin, one that won&#x27;t take multiple applications a day, to get the moisture your looking for. I think in my opinion, thats the best part, is that you don&#x27;t have to use as much of this product, as you do most others in order to get the result your looking for. I would definitely recommend this Moisturizer to any one whose looking for a great moisturizer that actually works.</li>
            <li> This Face Moisturizer is very concentrated and only takes a small amount to make my face and neck feel extremely hydrated.  The Moisturizer leaves my skin feeling smother and very firm, I love this product and will continue using it as my daily moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Great moisturizer,goes on easy but not greasy. I noticed a remarkable difference on my face. Will definitely keep using this moisturizer!</li>
            <li> I am little over 35 year  and need an ANTI- AGING formula  to keep skin looking softer and younger.The cream came in a beautiful packaging and would be great for a gift as well as for yourself. The directions are marked in the inside lid of the box as well as the bottle itself. I was happy with this as with some bottles it&#x27;s hard to read.  I have to use unscented or lightly scented moisturizers. This moisturizer is lightly scented and the cream goes a long way. I apply the cream after I wash my face in the am and apply in a circular motion. Then use at night again applying in a circular motion.  It left my skin moisturized and feeling soft. Its a very good skin moisturizer and absorbs quickly . I am happy with the results.</li>
            <li> I would like to say that this has beautiful packaging  and would be great for a gift as well as for yourself.  The directions are marked in the inside lid of the box as well as the bottle itself.  I was happy with this as with some bottles it&#x27;s hard to read.  I have rosacea and I have issues when using different creams.  So I have to use unscented or lightly scented moisturizers.  This moisturizer is lightly scented and the cream goes a long way.  I apply the cream after I wash my face in the am and apply in a circular motion.  Wear makeup as usual.  Then use at night again applying in a circular motion.  This cream did not break out my skin.  It left my skin moisturized and feeling soft.  I am happy with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got this product for free or a discounted price in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.</li>
            <li> I am a redhead with dry sensitive skin and when I was introduced to Zoe I was immediately impressed. The Aloe Vera ingredient works and feels great to my skin. I love this natural face moisturizer!!</li>
            <li> I love this light all natural moisturizer.  It goes on smoothly and feels very refreshing.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a few weeks. I use it in the morning and then again at night. I do think it shows a difference in my skin. I will definitely order it again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Zoe Reneir Facial Moisturizer for about a month and love it! This aloe vera based moisturizer is great for dry to normal skin. It&#x27;s light, goes on smoothly, absorbs well, and does not feel heavy even under my make-up! It even performs better than the expensive moisturizers I keep investing in. It&#x27;s lightly scented- but not enough to keep the males in the house from using it! Great for males or females-so be sure to get one for you and one for others! Natural/Vegan, gluten, paraben and cruelty free!  Looking forward to trying more products from Zoe Reneir.</li>
            <li> I love how light this is going on my face and it smells GREAT. It&#x27;s the best natural face moisturizer that I&#x27;ve used! Thanks for making such a nice product.</li>
            <li> Super luxurious-feeling moisturizer that absorbs right into your skin.  When they described it as velvety soft, they were not kidding.  Some lotions feel heavy when I put them on, even greasy.  Not this one.  I love how it feels as if you did not even put any on, yet the benefits remain obvious.  I am thrilled I was able to purchase this during a promotion so I had the chance to try it out.  If there is one negative to the product it would be the size of the jar.  When something is THIS good, you just want more of it!  :)</li>
            <li> I LOVE this stuff!  Goes on light and absorbs very quickly.  My skin feels and looks much better and that is only 4 days of using it so far!  Cant wait to see how it does after day number 30!!  Super quick shipping also!</li>
            <li> I gave this 3 stars because it made my skin very RED and itchy. So I gave it to my daughter and it works great on her. She loves it, she said it soaks into her skin fast with no greasy feeling at all. She would buy this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for only a week now and I have already felt a difference in my skin. My skin is now softer and brighter, also I&#x27;m noticing my &amp;#34;laugh lines&amp;#34; becoming less noticeable. I&#x27;m excited to see what other changes will occur over time. I totally recommend this product to anyone that has some flaws on their skin that&#x27;s wants to see a difference....Enjoy!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this item for the first time recently.  I happened upon it thru a referral from a friend. I am so glad for the referral because I have been searching for a moisturizer that did not leave a greasy feel and shine on my face. I would definitely purchase this item again.</li>
            <li> This is the best facial moisturizer I have used. I&#x27;m past 35 and I&#x27;m seeing more lines and wrinkles. After using Zoe the first time I loved the way my skin felt!!! Super soft and NOT greasy. I even have some discolored spots that are hardly noticeable now:) I defiantly recommend this for any lady or man( my husband loves it too)!!!!</li>
            <li> Aloe Vera is a natural moisturizer used to heal many dry or irritated skin conditions. The most common is sunburn. I have eczema so I am always looking for a great moisturizer to keep my skin healthy and hydrated. When offered the opportunity to test this moisturizer I knew I had to and I&#x27;m glad I did. I typically look for moisturizers that not only moisturizer well but are made with healthy, natural ingredients and this aloe vera mosturizier is a perfect combination of both.</li>
            <li> Just received my order about five days ago.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using the moisturizer twice a day&lt;br /&gt;and already my skin feels softer.  Will continue&lt;br /&gt;using this product expecting good results.&lt;br /&gt;I love the natural ingredients Ihat will not in any&lt;br /&gt;way harm my skin!</li>
            <li> works great! i have extremely dry skin. this moisturizer works well and it&#x27;s pretty effective!</li>
