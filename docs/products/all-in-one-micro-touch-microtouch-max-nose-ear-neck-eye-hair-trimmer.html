            <li>/&gt;The trimmer comes packaged in a nice, leather-like travel case that also included tweezers, a comb, a lint brush along with finger and toenail clippers.  </li>

            <li>Thank you in advance:)</li>
            <li>My wife and I love this product.</li>
            <li>tried a variety of different trimmers over the years, this ranks up there with the best of them.  </li>
            <li>My husband is pleased with the product.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s advertised as being able to do all kinds of trimming.  </li>
            <li>My husband really is enjoying it.  </li>
            <li>I would give it a star if the light worked!</li>
            <li>Overall the pouch is nice and great for travel.  </li>
            <li>Makes it easy to toss into an overnight bag or suitcase.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Nice idea, did not work very well</li>
            <li>The light still comes on, but the motor no longer operates.  </li>
            <li>The rest of the items (comb, travel toothbrush, tweezers) are too cheaply made to offer any degree of functionality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a snap to trim eyebrows and mustache with two available trim sizes.  </li>
            <li>I opened it and the light didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>Some are really good; others are less effective.</li>
            <li>Piece of junk,Monroe on first use and wasn&#x27;t able to switch.  </li>
            <li>Does not work as good as the commercial,  But works</li>

            <li>it&#x27;s nowhere near as functional as the original one that I had.</li>
            <li>It has a couple of useful items – the lint remover is decent as are the nail clippers.</li>
            <li>These are only marginally acceptable for hair trimming and the light never worked.</li>
            <li>Both myself and my husband tried this product (which was given in exchange for review), neither of us had any real complaints with it.  </li>
            <li>Cheap and only lasted a couple of months.</li>

            <li>My husband really likes it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay, but it doesn&#x27;t work as well with nose hairs as other products.</li>
            <li>A classic piece of made in China garbage.</li>
            <li>Instead spend a few more bucks and get a wahl.  </li>
            <li>Fell apart right away, and in the meantime, did not get a close enough shave to shave any part of your body.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just looking for something to eliminate that bit of blonde peach fuzz from my cheeks, and more importantly when my husband is on chemo and too sick to have a hair cut - this works fine for me to use on hair in ears and</li>
            <li>Works great - except for nose trimming; a bit awkward</li>
            <li>It worked, however the light did not work, it is only good for small jobs, not good for beards.</li>
            <li>D not waste your money on this item.  </li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t do as well as my old one.</li>
            <li>It deserved this rating because the light didn&#x27;t work and the blade was dull and pulling out the hairs within one hour, other than this it worked fine.</li>
            <li>I bought this to replace my old micro touch.  </li>
            <li>Definitely had to order a new one!</li>
            <li>Even with a fresh battery the blade speed would vacillate up and down even when it was not being used to trim hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> Both myself and my husband tried this product (which was given in exchange for review), neither of us had any real complaints with it.  He uses it for trimming his sideburns and to keep his goatee from bushing out.  Me, I used it for shaping my eyebrows and removing my devil&#x27;s bridge.  It works as advertised and I was surprised it only used a single AA battery - two were supplied with the set.  Nice!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer comes packaged in a nice, leather-like travel case that also included tweezers, a comb, a lint brush along with finger and toenail clippers.  Makes it easy to toss into an overnight bag or suitcase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We&#x27;ve tried a variety of different trimmers over the years, this ranks up there with the best of them.  Add in the travel pack and you just really can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of trimmers. Some are really good; others are less effective. But I never had one that was as painful and useless as this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is shaped like a tube trimmer, but the cutting area is a traditional set of teeth rather than tubes. The cutting ability is minimal. In fact, you can’t even say that it cuts hair – it sort of tries to gnaw through it. The result is messy and painful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The build quality is horrible. The housing is cheap and thin; the on/off switch is very fragile; the battery compartment had misaligned contacts. Even with a fresh battery the blade speed would vacillate up and down even when it was not being used to trim hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only saving grace, to a small degree, is the accessory kit. It has a couple of useful items – the lint remover is decent as are the nail clippers. The case itself is nice. The rest of the items (comb, travel toothbrush, tweezers) are too cheaply made to offer any degree of functionality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want a good tube trimmer check out the Philips Norelco NT9130.

            <li> this is much more than  I expected.  it&#x27;s a snap to trim eyebrows and mustache with two available trim sizes.  don&#x27;t know how I did without it.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s nowhere near as functional as the original one that I had.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t seem to have enough power with the battery.</li>
            <li> Piece of junk, lasted us about 1 whole minute of use and then the motor started to malfunction, not exaggerating, it&#x27;s cheaply built...STAY AWAY. I&#x27;ve purchased various brands of these over the years and this thing was the worst of all of them.</li>
            <li> great to have especially to clean your ears</li>
            <li> Fell apart right away, and in the meantime, did not get a close enough shave to shave any part of your body.</li>
            <li> Works great! Great buy!</li>

            <li> This is a piece of junk.  Fell apart right out of the package.  DON&#x27;T BUY!!!!!!</li>
            <li> My husband really likes it.</li>

            <li> This comes with lot of accessories. The hair trimming kit is good - I use it for nose and ear hair. I don&#x27;t use it to trim hair - barber it is! The kit is awesome and it is well worth. Couple of nail clips, combs, and other accessories. Coupld of AAA batteries included. Overall the pouch is nice and great for travel.  I was provided this product in exchange of a fair and honest review.</li>
            <li> I have purchased this in the past from various sellers and have had some good ones and some poor ones. This was a good one.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace my old micro touch.  It doesn&#x27;t seem to work as good.  I actually went back to my old one.</li>
            <li> This is our second Micro Touch,.  I&#x27;m just looking for something to eliminate that bit of blonde peach fuzz from my cheeks, and more importantly when my husband is on chemo and too sick to have a hair cut - this works fine for me to use on hair in ears and the spots he misses when shaving, especially on throat area.  It gets the job done and I do not want anything aggressive or a higher speed lest I hurt him.  We think it is very good value.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s advertised as being able to do all kinds of trimming.  It&#x27;s okay, but it doesn&#x27;t work as well with nose hairs as other products.</li>
            <li> It worked, however the light did not work, it is only good for small jobs, not good for beards.</li>
            <li> You know that PENNY you found on the ground? Save it- junk</li>
            <li> My husband really is enjoying it.  I works really good.</li>
            <li> I opened it and the light didn&#x27;t work. The machine quality is very poor. I tried to trim from my hand and it didn&#x27;t cut. It&#x27;s a very bad product.Not recommended. It&#x27;s not worth the money. I would give it a star if the light worked!</li>
            <li> We had one and it got dropped and broke! Definitely had to order a new one!</li>
