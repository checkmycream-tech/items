            <li>I was looking for a product that did not contain toxic chemicals of any kind...</li>
            <li>nice.</li>
            <li>This conditioner smells pretty good!</li>
            <li>I have very fine hair and am always looking for products that will give me volume and still leave my hair soft - this is a nice conditioner, it smells good (not too flowerey, just pleasant and good for men or women)</li>
            <li>and it does give my hair more lift and bounce.  </li>
            <li>I like Sauvé conditioner more.  </li>
            <li>The bottle looks pretty, but honestly, what&#x27;s inside it&#x27;s just ok.  </li>
            <li>This product worked surprisingly well for my hair, and left a nice scent.</li>
            <li>Burt&#x27;s Bees conditioner is not especially effective, and doesn&#x27;t smell especially good.</li>
            <li>Have fine hair</li>
            <li>Not that smooth, but it could be washed off easily.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this conditioner after reading the good reviews but to make a long story (of going to doctors, the emergency room, and a 2 day hospital stay), I can honestly pin point that it is this conditioner that has been the cause of an acute contact dermatitis of both ears.  </li>
            <li>Its sulfate free.</li>
            <li>I love this as much as the &amp;#34;matching&amp;#34; Burt&#x27;s Bees shampoo.  </li>
            <li>it can be used as i&#x27;m pregnant.</li>
            <li>and i&#x27;ve finally found one i love!</li>
            <li>Cheapest price found at least when I purchased it...love it, works great on my hair which gets greasy so quick!</li>
            <li>in this product has caused such an acute allergic reaction.</li>
            <li>Clearly though, everyone&#x27;s hair is different, and someone else is likely to love love love it!  </li>
            <li>My hair is very fine, so this is perfect , other brands leave my hair flat and ot feels oily very soon , this conditioner really conditions without leaving your hair flat, i love it</li>
            <li>I like this very much.</li>
            <li>most commercial brands do...</li>
            <li>While the product itself my be ok, Clorox (who owns Burt&#x27;s Bees) changed the packaging and reduced the size from 12oz to 10oz but kept the price the same.</li>
            <li>I did receive a good price, and shipping, as usual was speedy and well prepared.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair and it keeps my hair smooth but doesn&#x27;t weigh it down or make it greasy.</li>
            <li>Combine this with the shampoo, and I get very greasy hair.</li>
            <li>This conditioner works very well too.</li>
            <li>Does not provide much volume.</li>
            <li>my hair type is very over processed.</li>
            <li>I really value beauty products that are using natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t weigh down my fine hair.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;ve been dying to buy some natural shampoo</li>
            <li>It left my hair fluffy and refreshing.</li>
            <li>I usually combine the super shiny formula with the Very Volumizing formula tho&#x27;.  </li>
            <li>I really like Burt&#x27;s bees products, especially their lip balm and facial wipes.</li>
            <li>unlike other natural shampoo&#x27;s this one foams which i really like.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a better balance since my hair tends to be very dry and it is fairly thick so doesn&#x27;t need a lot of volumizing.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t particularly love the scent, and it just made my hair a little heavy.  </li>

            <li> I didn&#x27;t particularly love the scent, and it just made my hair a little heavy.  </li>
            <li> she has long hair she washes daily and likes the volumizing effect on her head and the moisturizing on the ends-</li>
            <li> and my hair would still feel dry.</li>
            <li> It does condition, but actually leaves my hair a little greasy.  </li>
            <li> extra long rinse sessions, waiting to wash my hair every three days, washing my hair everyday, washing with cold instead of hot, not using this conditioner, but still using the shampoo, using a pea sized amount.</li>
            <li> Anyways, I&#x27;d like to try other products of the Burt&#x27;s Bees.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll shampoo with one and condition with the other.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t slick down your hair like you may be used to with other conditioners, but it detangles well enough</li>
            <li> I do have thin, naturally curly/wavy hair</li>
            <li> works well and doesn&#x27;t weigh down the hair.</li>
            <li> I have very long hair that is not as thick as it once was.  </li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve got very dry dull hair</li>
            <li> I love that this has no parabens or other nasty stuff.</li>
            <li> and I trust the ingredients to be healthier than the products I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
            <li> I have extremely thick, unruly, curly hair.  </li>
            <li> i have thick virgin afro-textured hair.</li>
            <li> The smell doesn&#x27;t bother me though it&#x27;s not great, and it didn&#x27;t leave my curly hair shiny at all.</li>
            <li> But it feels like a bit difficult to be rinsed thoroughly.  </li>

            <li> I really wanted to like this conditioner after reading the good reviews but to make a long story (of going to doctors, the emergency room, and a 2 day hospital stay), I can honestly pin point that it is this conditioner that has been the cause of an acute contact dermatitis of both ears.  I will be writing to the company and plan on following up with a dermatologist to look further into which chemical(s) in this product has caused such an acute allergic reaction.</li>
            <li> Cheapest price found at least when I purchased it...love it, works great on my hair which gets greasy so quick!</li>
            <li> It does condition, but actually leaves my hair a little greasy.  Combine this with the shampoo, and I get very greasy hair.</li>
            <li> This conditioner smells pretty good! I totally love it! It left my hair fluffy and refreshing. But it feels like a bit difficult to be rinsed thoroughly.  Anyways, I&#x27;d like to try other products of the Burt&#x27;s Bees.</li>
            <li> I have extremely thick, unruly, curly hair.  This product worked surprisingly well for my hair, and left a nice scent.</li>
            <li> I have very long hair that is not as thick as it once was.  I appreciate the volumizing I get with this product.</li>
            <li> It smells wonderful and my hair has loved it. I bought it with the matching shampoo as well as Burt&#x27;s Bee&#x27;s Avocado Butter and it&#x27;s been great! I do have thin, naturally curly/wavy hair though so it might not work for all types!</li>
            <li> I really like Burt&#x27;s bees products, especially their lip balm and facial wipes. I feel like I could use a gallon of this stuff and my hair would still feel dry. I don&#x27;t understand that this is a conditioner, I have to use a leave-in after my shower to feel like I&#x27;ve moisturized my hair.</li>
            <li> i ordered it for my daughter and she loves it- she has long hair she washes daily and likes the volumizing effect on her head and the moisturizing on the ends-</li>
            <li> This conditioner smells AMAZING. My husband always comments how good my hair smells...and now he started using it. I love that this has no parabens or other nasty stuff. I really value beauty products that are using natural ingredients. This conditioner works very well too. I have fine hair and it keeps my hair smooth but doesn&#x27;t weigh it down or make it greasy. All around great product. I love Burt&#x27;s Bees!</li>
            <li> Not only is this product not volumizing,  it&#x27;s actually adds a greasy weight to your hair. I&#x27;m normally a big fan of Burts, but this product didn&#x27;t deliver. Some things I tried to see if it would work: extra long rinse sessions, waiting to wash my hair every three days, washing my hair everyday, washing with cold instead of hot, not using this conditioner, but still using the shampoo, using a pea sized amount.</li>
            <li> Does not provide much volume.</li>
            <li> Excellent Conditioner. Wondered why it doesn&#x27;t have soy with the pomegranate as it used to have, but good for my scalp.</li>
            <li> Nice conditioner and it doesn&#x27;t weigh down my fine hair.</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair and am always looking for products that will give me volume and still leave my hair soft - this is a nice conditioner, it smells good (not too flowerey, just pleasant and good for men or women) and it does give my hair more lift and bounce.  I plan to purchase again.</li>
            <li> The bottle looks pretty, but honestly, what&#x27;s inside it&#x27;s just ok.  I didn&#x27;t particularly love the scent, and it just made my hair a little heavy.  Clearly though, everyone&#x27;s hair is different, and someone else is likely to love love love it!  I did receive a good price, and shipping, as usual was speedy and well prepared.</li>
            <li> I like this very much. works well and doesn&#x27;t weigh down the hair. smells great too. I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve been dying to buy some natural shampoo and i&#x27;ve finally found one i love! unlike other natural shampoo&#x27;s this one foams which i really like. my hair type is very over processed. i dyed it for a over a year combined with using the curler/straightner. i&#x27;ve got very dry dull hair and i&#x27;m on my way to healthier hair with regular hair masks and only using heat once a week. from using this shampoo and conditioner i&#x27;ve already noticed a great difference. my hair feels softer and looks shinier. can&#x27;t wait to keep using it i definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li> One of the very best shaving creams I have ever used.</li>
            <li> I brought this product a gew weeks ago. Its sulfate free. its good for my hair. i have thick virgin afro-textured hair. after using this conditoner I do not have to put oil in my hair at all. Its a great product</li>
            <li> My hair is very fine, so this is perfect , other brands leave my hair flat and ot feels oily very soon , this conditioner really conditions without leaving your hair flat, i love it</li>
            <li> I was looking for a product that did not contain toxic chemicals of any kind...most commercial brands do...like all Burt&#x27;s Bees shampoo and conditioner formulas, this one also does not contain any toxic chemicals or perfumes. It smells great and works great.  I usually combine the super shiny formula with the Very Volumizing formula tho&#x27;.  I&#x27;ll shampoo with one and condition with the other.  It&#x27;s a better balance since my hair tends to be very dry and it is fairly thick so doesn&#x27;t need a lot of volumizing. Depending on your hair type, you may not have to combine them.</li>
            <li> The smell doesn&#x27;t bother me though it&#x27;s not great, and it didn&#x27;t leave my curly hair shiny at all.</li>
            <li> I love this as much as the &amp;#34;matching&amp;#34; Burt&#x27;s Bees shampoo.  It doesn&#x27;t slick down your hair like you may be used to with other conditioners, but it detangles well enough and I trust the ingredients to be healthier than the products I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
            <li> Used at  my granddaughters house then ordered some for myself.  Have fine hair&lt;br /&gt;Really helps with the volume.  Do not use a lot. and rinse well. Smells good.</li>
            <li> While the product itself my be ok, Clorox (who owns Burt&#x27;s Bees) changed the packaging and reduced the size from 12oz to 10oz but kept the price the same.</li>
            <li> nice. it can be used as i&#x27;m pregnant. will keep using it. Not that smooth, but it could be washed off easily.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I thought it would be good for my child&#x27;s itchy scalp.  Did not help.  I like Sauvé conditioner more.  Burt&#x27;s Bees conditioner is not especially effective, and doesn&#x27;t smell especially good.</li>
