    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>After a day of use, I decided the non-active ingredient for agricultural pesticide use is probably not in my best interest.  </li>

            <li>I laughed at their demise!)&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>BUT it is good stuff.</li>
            <li>It smells kind of like garlic/oregano oil, so it isn&#x27;t incredibly pleasant if you use it indoors.</li>
            <li>Nice quality, wonderful, smooth, moisturizing oil.</li>
            <li>Neem oil is GREAT for reducing the problems of TICKS, FLEAS, FLIES, GNATS and much more.  </li>

            <li>I love this stuff!</li>
            <li>You can use this as a face moisturizer, there are many ways you can use this!</li>
            <li>Smell strong like garlic but does a great job on skin and hair.</li>
            <li>amazing, purchased and viewed at Amazon</li>
            <li>It is amazing.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s nice to have on hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This appears to be effective at treating my scalp itching/flaking from some undiagnosed dermatological issue....</li>
            <li>Just run it under warm water and shake well.</li>
            <li>It worked very well and we got the best zucchini and cucumber crop this year.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;re not going to smell like a rose using this.</li>
            <li>Add 15 ml to warm water and soak the feet in this preparation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Should this happen put the bottle in warm water (below 95 degree F) to liquefy.</li>
            <li>Should this happen put the bottle in warm water (below 95 degree F) to liquefy.</li>
            <li>Nice concentration.</li>
            <li>We tried this and it is clearing up nicely.</li>
            <li>but it really reminds me of Vietnamese peanut butter sauce for dipping spring rolls ROFL!</li>
            <li>When the bottle arrived it was kind of oily where it might have gotten out of the bottle</li>
            <li>I use it in my bees wax face &amp; body creams I make at home &amp; is really nice moisturizer on the hands.</li>
            <li>this will be my new best friend.</li>
            <li>Its not the most pleasant smell in the world but its not that strong.</li>
            <li>I was able to purchase this product at a discounted rate for my honest and unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li>but your hair/scalp is soft, conditioned and it feels great!</li>
            <li>Excellent natural product to deter pests from plants (outdoor &amp; indoor).  </li>
            <li>I love all things Neem, and this oil is SUPER EFFECTIVE!</li>
            <li>Use this to make my own organic pest spray for my horses, 3 other ingredients and you have a very effective, environmentally safe, non toxic fly spray.  </li>
            <li>Whenever you apply it be sure to rinse it out</li>
            <li>also love the fact that it keeps mosquitoes away during the summer months.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m here to purchase three more bottles.</li>
            <li>I would agree with most people that I&#x27;ve seen and compare it to garlicky-oniony peanuts.  </li>
            <li>love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t sprayed it in a day, and when I watered them most of the smell disappeared.</li>
            <li>I ended up using it to make soap and added a lot of essential oil to cover the odor as best as I could.</li>
            <li>Anytime I buy a product off of the internet I always research the product, and read many reviews.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s a much better that using pesticides</li>
            <li>Spray the mixture on top of all the leaves and on the undersides where insects often hide â€“ you can also spray it around the roots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>love this.  </li>
            <li>Have to say I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s now been more than a couple of weeks</li>
            <li>The smell doesn&#x27;t bother me like most people have said.</li>
            <li>so I had my husband use a box cutter to cut from top to bottom</li>
            <li>Safe and reliable.</li>
            <li>This is authentic neem oil.</li>
            <li>I love neem oil</li>
            <li>Sure it leaves a sort of garlic type scent</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m okay with that to keep the bugs at bay.  </li>
            <li>Neem oil is generally safe to use on otherwise healthy dogs, people and children for pest prevention.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this oil.</li>
            <li>My hair is fluffier, has more body, and more flexible.  </li>
            <li>I love this oil.</li>
            <li>and I have been pleased with it.</li>
            <li>My daughter loved it, except the smell which is not perfume-like, lol, and she&#x27;s a teen.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>It has a very unique but bearable scent if used alone</li>
            <li>The quality of this particular product is great though, you wont be dissapointed</li>
            <li>Excited to put it to use!</li>
            <li>but it melts quickly under warm water.  </li>
            <li>For sure, it is not an alluring scent, but I don&#x27;t find the scent particularly strong or offensive.</li>
            <li>My first experience with neem oil, and it must be good because it smells REALLY strong, which is what neem oil is supposed to do.</li>
            <li>Really happy about the product so far.</li>
            <li>Works great anywhere making the skin really soft.</li>
            <li>The oil is easy to wash off (just shampoo twice).  </li>
            <li>strong herbal medicine leaches chemicals from plastic.  </li>
            <li>It does have a strong smell</li>
            <li>This trick might help make it easier for others who are strongly offended by the smell.  </li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t get a strong garlic smell.</li>
            <li>This is good quality Neem at a decent price.</li>
            <li>Large bottle of real neem oil at a greAt price.</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s a huge bottle, so you might want to try something else if your problem is scabies.</li>
            <li>Amazing value, effective product for both personal use and in the garden.</li>
            <li>and now I am stuck with a huge 25 lb box and trying to give it away to every neighbor and stranger I can talk into taking some.  </li>
            <li>At 55, I was going to the dentist every 3 months for anther root canal, so this is a huge relief.</li>
            <li>I hope it will become available again.</li>
            <li>great in my facial soap</li>
            <li>It only smells like Thai food (lol).</li>
            <li>I put together the #3rd product before time, so I can always have it in the fridge ready to be used as my neem toner that I found on a website &amp; it works perfectly.</li>
            <li>I thought it would be a good product to use for my natural hair transition since it was a \\&quot;natural\\&quot; oil.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>Also makes your hair super shiny and strong.</li>
            <li>Believe it or not,  you do get used to the smell,  because the benefits are worth it!</li>
            <li>Excellent and unbelievable delivery and quality product.</li>
            <li>Exactly as described:)</li>
            <li>Neem has worked the best at keeping the f***ers at bay, but we haven&#x27;t been adamant enough with it, I don&#x27;t think, to fully conquer them once and for all.</li>
            <li>After finishing a 16oz bottle of neem which we applied to ourselves every night before getting into a bed of clean sheets, we ran out and I bought a bottle of 10% permethrin.</li>
            <li>Plus this bottle will last FOREVER, so it was a really, really good buy.</li>
            <li>This oil tends to thicken if it gets too cool.</li>
            <li>I am now trying this product I do not have any good news for now, perhaps later.</li>
            <li>I personally think it smells good.</li>
            <li>The jar makes sure the oil doesn&#x27;t burn and gently melts the oil.</li>
            <li>If you want to make your own salt scrub you can mix a jar of sea salt with this and your skin will feel baby soft.</li>
            <li>The odor is really not so bad.</li>
            <li>Smells like burned peanuts, but not bad at all.</li>
            <li>the oils smells like food, not bad food</li>
            <li>Other than the smell all I read was great things about this oil.</li>
            <li>This product arrived quickly and as described.</li>
            <li>it fades quickly.  </li>
            <li>While I wasn&#x27;t using the stuff before I became pregnant, I&#x27;ve been using it throughout my pregnancy to try and get rid of all of the scabies before the baby comes, and it hasn&#x27;t done any harm to either of us.</li>
            <li>It has done wonders to my hair and the change has been quick.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little stinky, but as far as being effective, it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li>I keep this in the refrigerator to keep it fresh.</li>
            <li>Do not store the mixture; make fresh formulation for each spray.</li>
            <li>It is a bit smelly, but worth it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure this isn&#x27;t an option when you wanna get intimate either unless your spouse lathered themselves too haha.</li>
            <li>This is the best price I&#x27;ve seen on neem oil anywhere and the quality seems very comparable to more expensive brands.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also useful keeping bugs</li>
            <li>is a nice size bottle so it&#x27;ll last me years.</li>
            <li>But, it was worth a shot.  </li>
            <li>Time will tell as far as helping grow out my eyebrows :)</li>
            <li>But that is an easy fix, all you have to do it warm a little bit in a glass jar placed in a pot of water and heat until it becomes liquid.</li>
            <li>I do appreciate the refund you will be hearing back from me again :) super eager to try this product</li>
            <li>A light application on your body should not be strong enough for anyone to smell</li>
            <li>Also great on hair and scalp....apply before getting into the shower, then shower/shampoo as usual.  </li>
            <li>This oil seems like a great quality and definitely works for its intended purpose as an ingredient in an organic spray to control red lily beetles (thank goodness</li>
            <li>I use this in my garden, and when mixed properly, it works AMAZING!</li>
            <li>Sure enough, it is fall now, and the bottle looks and feels like the contents are butter!</li>
            <li>So, in about 12 months I hope my nail will be healthy, it has already healed the smaller toenails after 5 weeks.</li>
            <li>Mixed a safe &amp;#34;pesticide&amp;#34; spray for my fruit trees, worked pretty well</li>
            <li>Three weeks ago my daughter came home with her first bout of head lice.</li>
            <li>After successfully getting rid of the pest I still have her add a small amount of neem to her shampoo twice a week .</li>
            <li>I first bought this years ago to help with my psoriasis.</li>
            <li>First let me start by saying I did not use this Neem oil that this review is for because of the smell</li>
            <li>even more, it keeps mosquitos away outside.  </li>
            <li>Some of the recipes below use higher percentages - but keep a lookout for any skin irritation.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is very moisturizing!</li>
            <li>I put it in my shampoo and my hair is much softer!  </li>
            <li>Warning: since it is an oil, be aware of surrounding objects when spraying on plants.</li>
            <li>It also appears to be effective at healing/soothing other dermatitis like irritations from heat allergy.</li>
            <li>Yes, it has a kind of slightly garlicky peanut scent to it, but it goes away fast, and even though I am not crazy about the smell, I do not find it to be a nuisance to the nose.</li>
            <li>After the shampoo the scent is eliminated pretty much...</li>
            <li>Neem oil can easily solidify - even at low room temperatures.</li>
            <li>Neem oil can easily solidify - even at low room temperatures.</li>
            <li>Use this on my face at night only because it smells too strong to wear out.</li>
            <li>but I could not be certain.  </li>
            <li>I put about 2 tablespoons in a large spray bottle, then soapy water.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m now searching for ways to use this large bottle up...</li>
            <li>So I bought this pure neem oil.</li>
            <li>If used undiluted, on your whole body, it smells alright</li>
            <li>This is very concentrated stuff, so you will need to dilute it.</li>
            <li>but in the morning my skin appear brighter and was software i guess beauty really pain will be using often now thank</li>
            <li>I spent over 1000,00 in 6 months and never went more than a couple of weeks without someone being fed on, and all I needed was this???</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t bother me too much</li>
            <li>I just received this product and I really like it.  </li>
            <li>really works.</li>

            <li>Coastal Scents Neem Oil, 16.90 Fluid Ounce Price: $12.95 Eligible for free shipping with Amazon Prime.&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:</li>
            <li>Very helpful</li>
            <li>But, it does work very well.</li>
            <li>Works really well.</li>
            <li>and I hope NEEM Oil provides the much needed relief for McKenzie and Max.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>maybe even make you want to gag if you get real close and smell.</li>
            <li>then I can see why someone would really dislike this...</li>
            <li>I use it 1-2 times a week as a scalp rub and oil my whole head and hair and leave it for a day or overnight.</li>
            <li>Works very well.  </li>
            <li>I just unscrew it now and pour straight.</li>
            <li>Neem oil gets rids of stubborn pimples fast.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using a mixture of warm water, a few drops dish soap, and a squirt of neem oil and spraying it in my garden.</li>
            <li>the taste is indescribable but bitterly gross or whatever, maybe if you lick it you can comment and add to my review since everyone is different lmao.</li>
            <li>Not only is it great as a bug repellent but it smells really good!</li>
            <li>this particular brand seems to be 100% pure as advertised</li>
            <li>I recommend diluting it with other, better smelling ingredients, then the scent won&#x27;t be noticed regardless of body temperature.</li>
            <li>Make sure you use other carrier oils to neutralize the smell.</li>
            <li>But, it has so many other uses.</li>
            <li>I had to squeeze the bottle to get the contents out but after squeezing so much, you won&#x27;t be able to get the rest of the half out</li>
            <li>I shake the bottle and put neem oil on my scalp and massage it to stimulate hair growth, and I usually use almond oil on the rest of my hair which is amazing.</li>
            <li>The itching and the new formation of bumps were gone!  </li>
            <li>main thing people complain about with Neem oil is the smell.  </li>
            <li>I bought this neem oil because I heard about its beneficial uses particular in hair and scalp issues and that it would help with premature graying of hair.</li>
            <li>Lavender or lemongrass essential oils work well â€“ but you could add your personal favorite.  </li>
            <li>Better safe than sorry, I returned the item.</li>
            <li>I hope that it will prove that I have finally found the effective natural flea repellant that I have soooo long been in search of.  </li>
            <li>This was a great price for the amount, and I love that the bottle has such a small opening for dispensing the oil, because it keeps it from being so messy (think of every olive oil bottle ever!).</li>
            <li>I highly recommend using it at bedtime</li>
            <li>this toner above that you made can also be used in your bath water for your body like to get rid of skin infections, body breakouts of any kind like, Eczema, Acne, Rashes, Mosquito/Bug Bites prepare the concoction as mentioned above and add about 100 ml or 3.51 fluid ounces of it into your bathing water).</li>
            <li>The oil can be emulsified (to mix with water) by adding normal dish washing liquid to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Neem is very powerful ( a little goes a long way) and it has a strong odor.</li>
            <li>I think that, because it is less dense than coconut oil - which I have used many times in the past, the hair strand absorbs it better.</li>
            <li>but you wouldnt want your hair or body to smell like it other than that its fine</li>
            <li>I mix barely half an ounce of this in a big spray bottle with a pump-ful of dish-washing soap (or sometimes shampoo) and then fill it with warm water.</li>
            <li>However, I mixed the Neem Oil into some Coconut Oil and put it onto my skin to keep mosquitoes away, and one darn skeeter landed right on my arm while the skin was still glistening of the Coconut-Neem-Oil-Mixture.</li>
            <li>I use a few drops of this mixed with mineral oi and lemongrass essential oil for a great natural bug spray.  </li>
            <li>bed bugs can live a year without feeding.</li>
            <li>I have tried numerous products and one prescription for this and nothing really helps much, but this is making an improvement.</li>
            <li>Stinks, but I am loving that I feel comfortable in my skin.</li>
            <li>Once you warm up though, watch out, it can clear a small room!  </li>
            <li>with these two soaps above #1 &amp; #2 I first wash my hands of course</li>
            <li>but something similar, it is not that solid but more of a creamier solid buttery type that is easier to dig away at than coconut.</li>
            <li>I just add an ounce to white vinegar in a pump sprayer, then had HOT water, pump it up and spray everything.  </li>
            <li>GETS RID OF HEAD LICE COMPLETELY!</li>
            <li>good and the smell not strong like other brand.</li>
            <li>then I filled a bucket with a slightly stronger mixture and went over the floors after every moping.</li>
            <li>It has not been tested to full extreme yet since fleas are not out in groves yet.  </li>
            <li>Completely luxurious feeling on your skin.  </li>
            <li>I want them to replace this oil smells old.</li>
            <li>but it does the job an is completely non toxic</li>
            <li>It may smell garlicky and smoky, but WOW does it work wonders.</li>
            <li>I had ordered the oil several months ago, so I was ready to see if it would work.</li>
            <li>skin is so soft after a night of applying neem combined with my lotion.  </li>
            <li>It hasn&#x27;t worked nearly as well as the neem, so we&#x27;re Getting another bottle.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve done so much research on this product over the last five months- in regards to the comment about causing infertility,</li>
            <li>me tell you, I do a lot of research online about alternative organic natural &amp; healthier treatments for everything &amp; when I found the herb Neem</li>
            <li>Also as an alternative for you people that love showers purchase one of those tiny for travel empty spray bottles &amp; pour the solution into it &amp; spray your entire body with it &amp; stay in shower for about 15 minutes without water on you &amp; then after 15 minutes, then wash it off &amp; continue your shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>on how to use and dilute Neem oil:&lt;br /&gt;I have listed some recipes / ways to use Neem oil below - but a rule of thumb to remember is to keep your dilution of of Neem oil to about 2 - 5% of any mixture that you apply directly onto your skin.</li>
            <li>Apply 1 drop of undiluted oil directly on warts once per day.</li>
            <li>Do not place in near boiling water, as it may reduce the effectiveness of the oil.ld that occur discontinue use.</li>
            <li>Do not place in near boiling water, as it may reduce the effectiveness of the oil.</li>
            <li>but I find it completely tolerable.  </li>
            <li>Smells, and makes everything smell, but it does help the skin and hair so far, in terms of health</li>
            <li>The \\&quot;odor\\&quot; fell below expectation and that probably helped a lot with liking this product SO FAR.  </li>
            <li>so the smell isn&#x27;t so much lingering inside the house as it did when I initially would spray it on them before stepping out.  </li>
            <li>Makes me smell like old garlic tho.  </li>
            <li>The Whole Foods next door to me does not even sell it in liquid form.</li>
            <li>I got a complete lice kit and it had the nit comb and worked well.</li>
            <li>neem oil in a cool dark place, away from sunlight.</li>
            <li>Store neem oil in a cool dark place, away from sunlight.</li>
            <li>, my 14 yr old Golden Retriever, McKenzie, with chronic skin allergies and both McKenzie &amp; my Peke, Max suffering from severe allergic reaction to flea bites - I&#x27;ll take the smell and the constant oily fur anytime so long as it offers relief from the torment of itchy skin.  </li>
            <li>Diatomaceous Earth was such a huge let down</li>
            <li>As Neem oil has a rather strong smell you might want to add a few drops of your essential oil to any mixture to mask the smell.</li>
            <li>As Neem oil has a rather strong smell you might want to add a few drops of your essential oil to any mixture to mask the smell.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice big bottle and should last a couple of years at least.</li>
            <li>My husband loves the way it makes his psoriasis calm down and</li>
            <li>The oil feels raw and fresh!</li>
            <li>It has a strong small, slightly reminiscent of peanuts.</li>
            <li>I had a run in with scabies a while back and tried almost everything I could find to help clear them up.  </li>
            <li>I did the walls around the bed, the bed, furniture, in short, I sprayed everything and anything near our evening sitting or sleeping areas.</li>
            <li>but you should mix it with another oil because putting neem directly on you without mixing can actually irritate your skin.</li>
            <li>This is my second bottle of Neem Old that I have ordered from Coastal Scents.</li>
            <li>It solidifies at cool temperatures and becomes very uneven in texture and couldn&#x27;t be squeezed out of the bottle unless thoroughly warmed up and liquified.</li>
            <li>If you have thin, brittle hair, apply it once a week, leave it on as long as you can stand the smell which, like many have said, is a combination of peanuts and garlic, and soon you will notice a considerable improvement.</li>
            <li>I can work outside without being eaten alive by these giant country bugs we have out here in the woods.</li>
            <li>I suffer from adult acne, and I&#x27;ve noticed an overall decrease in my facial skin being red and breaking out while receiving an improvement in the texture of it.</li>
            <li>a concoction of A Tablespoon of #3 (Ground Neem Leaf Powder) in a half liter or about 4 cups of Distilled Purified water till the water (that only cost me a dollar or two for a gallon at Walmart) turns green (Which is about 30 minutes, I first brought it to a boil &amp; (all the time I kept stirring), then I immediately turned it down to low heat to simmer for about 30 minutes, then I take it off the stove &amp; let it sit with top still on to steep for about an hour or two until it cools down).</li>
            <li>The product is very thick; just warm a little in the microwave.</li>

            <li> Perfectly good Neem Oil.  </li>
            <li> I laughed at their demise!)&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> BUT it is good stuff.</li>
            <li> It smells kind of like garlic/oregano oil, so it isn&#x27;t incredibly pleasant if you use it indoors.</li>
            <li> Nice quality, wonderful, smooth, moisturizing oil.</li>
            <li> Neem oil is GREAT for reducing the problems of TICKS, FLEAS, FLIES, GNATS and much more.  </li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> This has kept my lemon tree healthy!  </li>

            <li> Smell strong like garlic but does a great job on skin and hair.</li>
            <li> amazing, purchased and viewed at Amazon</li>
            <li> It is amazing.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s nice to have on hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This appears to be effective at treating my scalp itching/flaking from some undiagnosed dermatological issue....</li>
            <li> Just run it under warm water and shake well.</li>
            <li> It worked very well and we got the best zucchini and cucumber crop this year.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;re not going to smell like a rose using this.</li>
            <li> Add 15 ml to warm water and soak the feet in this preparation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Should this happen put the bottle in warm water (below 95 degree F) to liquefy.</li>
            <li> Should this happen put the bottle in warm water (below 95 degree F) to liquefy.</li>
            <li> Nice concentration.</li>
            <li> We tried this and it is clearing up nicely.</li>
            <li> but it really reminds me of Vietnamese peanut butter sauce for dipping spring rolls ROFL!</li>
            <li> When the bottle arrived it was kind of oily where it might have gotten out of the bottle</li>
            <li> I use it in my bees wax face &amp; body creams I make at home &amp; is really nice moisturizer on the hands.</li>
            <li> this will be my new best friend.</li>
            <li> Its not the most pleasant smell in the world but its not that strong.</li>
            <li> I was able to purchase this product at a discounted rate for my honest and unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li> but your hair/scalp is soft, conditioned and it feels great!</li>
            <li> Excellent natural product to deter pests from plants (outdoor &amp; indoor).  </li>
            <li> I love all things Neem, and this oil is SUPER EFFECTIVE!</li>
            <li> Use this to make my own organic pest spray for my horses, 3 other ingredients and you have a very effective, environmentally safe, non toxic fly spray.  </li>
            <li> Whenever you apply it be sure to rinse it out</li>
            <li> also love the fact that it keeps mosquitoes away during the summer months.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m here to purchase three more bottles.</li>
            <li> I would agree with most people that I&#x27;ve seen and compare it to garlicky-oniony peanuts.  </li>
            <li> love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t sprayed it in a day, and when I watered them most of the smell disappeared.</li>
            <li> I ended up using it to make soap and added a lot of essential oil to cover the odor as best as I could.</li>
            <li> Anytime I buy a product off of the internet I always research the product, and read many reviews.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s a much better that using pesticides</li>
            <li> Spray the mixture on top of all the leaves and on the undersides where insects often hide â€“ you can also spray it around the roots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> love this.  </li>
            <li> Have to say I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s now been more than a couple of weeks</li>
            <li> The smell doesn&#x27;t bother me like most people have said.</li>
            <li> so I had my husband use a box cutter to cut from top to bottom</li>
            <li> Safe and reliable.</li>
            <li> This is authentic neem oil.</li>
            <li> I love neem oil</li>
            <li> Sure it leaves a sort of garlic type scent</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m okay with that to keep the bugs at bay.  </li>
            <li> Neem oil is generally safe to use on otherwise healthy dogs, people and children for pest prevention.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this oil.</li>
            <li> My hair is fluffier, has more body, and more flexible.  </li>
            <li> I love this oil.</li>
            <li> and I have been pleased with it.</li>
            <li> My daughter loved it, except the smell which is not perfume-like, lol, and she&#x27;s a teen.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> It has a very unique but bearable scent if used alone</li>
            <li> The quality of this particular product is great though, you wont be dissapointed</li>
            <li> Excited to put it to use!</li>
            <li> but it melts quickly under warm water.  </li>
            <li> For sure, it is not an alluring scent, but I don&#x27;t find the scent particularly strong or offensive.</li>
            <li> My first experience with neem oil, and it must be good because it smells REALLY strong, which is what neem oil is supposed to do.</li>
            <li> Really happy about the product so far.</li>
            <li> Works great anywhere making the skin really soft.</li>
            <li> The oil is easy to wash off (just shampoo twice).  </li>
            <li> strong herbal medicine leaches chemicals from plastic.  </li>
            <li> It does have a strong smell</li>
            <li> This trick might help make it easier for others who are strongly offended by the smell.  </li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t get a strong garlic smell.</li>
            <li> This is good quality Neem at a decent price.</li>
            <li> Large bottle of real neem oil at a greAt price.</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s a huge bottle, so you might want to try something else if your problem is scabies.</li>
            <li> Amazing value, effective product for both personal use and in the garden.</li>
            <li> and now I am stuck with a huge 25 lb box and trying to give it away to every neighbor and stranger I can talk into taking some.  </li>
            <li> At 55, I was going to the dentist every 3 months for anther root canal, so this is a huge relief.</li>
            <li> I hope it will become available again.</li>
            <li> great in my facial soap</li>
            <li> It only smells like Thai food (lol).</li>
            <li> I put together the #3rd product before time, so I can always have it in the fridge ready to be used as my neem toner that I found on a website &amp; it works perfectly.</li>
            <li> I thought it would be a good product to use for my natural hair transition since it was a \\&quot;natural\\&quot; oil.</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> Also makes your hair super shiny and strong.</li>
            <li> Believe it or not,  you do get used to the smell,  because the benefits are worth it!</li>
            <li> Excellent and unbelievable delivery and quality product.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described:)</li>
            <li> Neem has worked the best at keeping the f***ers at bay, but we haven&#x27;t been adamant enough with it, I don&#x27;t think, to fully conquer them once and for all.</li>
            <li> After finishing a 16oz bottle of neem which we applied to ourselves every night before getting into a bed of clean sheets, we ran out and I bought a bottle of 10% permethrin.</li>
            <li> Plus this bottle will last FOREVER, so it was a really, really good buy.</li>
            <li> This oil tends to thicken if it gets too cool.</li>
            <li> I am now trying this product I do not have any good news for now, perhaps later.</li>
            <li> I personally think it smells good.</li>
            <li> The jar makes sure the oil doesn&#x27;t burn and gently melts the oil.</li>
            <li> If you want to make your own salt scrub you can mix a jar of sea salt with this and your skin will feel baby soft.</li>
            <li> The odor is really not so bad.</li>
            <li> Smells like burned peanuts, but not bad at all.</li>
            <li> the oils smells like food, not bad food</li>
            <li> Other than the smell all I read was great things about this oil.</li>
            <li> This product arrived quickly and as described.</li>
            <li> it fades quickly.  </li>
            <li> While I wasn&#x27;t using the stuff before I became pregnant, I&#x27;ve been using it throughout my pregnancy to try and get rid of all of the scabies before the baby comes, and it hasn&#x27;t done any harm to either of us.</li>
            <li> It has done wonders to my hair and the change has been quick.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little stinky, but as far as being effective, it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> I keep this in the refrigerator to keep it fresh.</li>
            <li> Do not store the mixture; make fresh formulation for each spray.</li>
            <li> It is a bit smelly, but worth it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure this isn&#x27;t an option when you wanna get intimate either unless your spouse lathered themselves too haha.</li>
            <li> This is the best price I&#x27;ve seen on neem oil anywhere and the quality seems very comparable to more expensive brands.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also useful keeping bugs</li>
            <li> is a nice size bottle so it&#x27;ll last me years.</li>
            <li> But, it was worth a shot.  </li>
            <li> Time will tell as far as helping grow out my eyebrows :)</li>
            <li> But that is an easy fix, all you have to do it warm a little bit in a glass jar placed in a pot of water and heat until it becomes liquid.</li>
            <li> I do appreciate the refund you will be hearing back from me again :) super eager to try this product</li>
            <li> A light application on your body should not be strong enough for anyone to smell</li>
            <li> Also great on hair and scalp....apply before getting into the shower, then shower/shampoo as usual.  </li>
            <li> This oil seems like a great quality and definitely works for its intended purpose as an ingredient in an organic spray to control red lily beetles (thank goodness</li>
            <li> I use this in my garden, and when mixed properly, it works AMAZING!</li>
            <li> Sure enough, it is fall now, and the bottle looks and feels like the contents are butter!</li>
            <li> So, in about 12 months I hope my nail will be healthy, it has already healed the smaller toenails after 5 weeks.</li>
            <li> Mixed a safe &amp;#34;pesticide&amp;#34; spray for my fruit trees, worked pretty well</li>
            <li> Three weeks ago my daughter came home with her first bout of head lice.</li>
            <li> After successfully getting rid of the pest I still have her add a small amount of neem to her shampoo twice a week .</li>
            <li> I first bought this years ago to help with my psoriasis.</li>
            <li> First let me start by saying I did not use this Neem oil that this review is for because of the smell</li>
            <li> even more, it keeps mosquitos away outside.  </li>
            <li> Some of the recipes below use higher percentages - but keep a lookout for any skin irritation.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is very moisturizing!</li>
            <li> I put it in my shampoo and my hair is much softer!  </li>
            <li> Warning: since it is an oil, be aware of surrounding objects when spraying on plants.</li>
            <li> It also appears to be effective at healing/soothing other dermatitis like irritations from heat allergy.</li>
            <li> Yes, it has a kind of slightly garlicky peanut scent to it, but it goes away fast, and even though I am not crazy about the smell, I do not find it to be a nuisance to the nose.</li>
            <li> After the shampoo the scent is eliminated pretty much...</li>
            <li> Neem oil can easily solidify - even at low room temperatures.</li>
            <li> Neem oil can easily solidify - even at low room temperatures.</li>
            <li> Use this on my face at night only because it smells too strong to wear out.</li>
            <li> but I could not be certain.  </li>
            <li> I put about 2 tablespoons in a large spray bottle, then soapy water.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m now searching for ways to use this large bottle up...</li>
            <li> So I bought this pure neem oil.</li>
            <li> If used undiluted, on your whole body, it smells alright</li>
            <li> This is very concentrated stuff, so you will need to dilute it.</li>
            <li> but in the morning my skin appear brighter and was software i guess beauty really pain will be using often now thank</li>
            <li> I spent over 1000,00 in 6 months and never went more than a couple of weeks without someone being fed on, and all I needed was this???</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t bother me too much</li>
            <li> I just received this product and I really like it.  </li>
            <li> really works.</li>

            <li> Very helpful</li>
            <li> But, it does work very well.</li>
            <li> Works really well.</li>
            <li> and I hope NEEM Oil provides the much needed relief for McKenzie and Max.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> maybe even make you want to gag if you get real close and smell.</li>
            <li> then I can see why someone would really dislike this...</li>
            <li> I use it 1-2 times a week as a scalp rub and oil my whole head and hair and leave it for a day or overnight.</li>
            <li> Works very well.  </li>
            <li> I just unscrew it now and pour straight.</li>
            <li> Neem oil gets rids of stubborn pimples fast.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using a mixture of warm water, a few drops dish soap, and a squirt of neem oil and spraying it in my garden.</li>
            <li> the taste is indescribable but bitterly gross or whatever, maybe if you lick it you can comment and add to my review since everyone is different lmao.</li>
            <li> Not only is it great as a bug repellent but it smells really good!</li>
            <li> this particular brand seems to be 100% pure as advertised</li>
            <li> I recommend diluting it with other, better smelling ingredients, then the scent won&#x27;t be noticed regardless of body temperature.</li>
            <li> Make sure you use other carrier oils to neutralize the smell.</li>
            <li> But, it has so many other uses.</li>
            <li> I had to squeeze the bottle to get the contents out but after squeezing so much, you won&#x27;t be able to get the rest of the half out</li>
            <li> I shake the bottle and put neem oil on my scalp and massage it to stimulate hair growth, and I usually use almond oil on the rest of my hair which is amazing.</li>
            <li> The itching and the new formation of bumps were gone!  </li>
            <li> main thing people complain about with Neem oil is the smell.  </li>
            <li> I bought this neem oil because I heard about its beneficial uses particular in hair and scalp issues and that it would help with premature graying of hair.</li>
            <li> Lavender or lemongrass essential oils work well â€“ but you could add your personal favorite.  </li>
            <li> Better safe than sorry, I returned the item.</li>
            <li> I hope that it will prove that I have finally found the effective natural flea repellant that I have soooo long been in search of.  </li>
            <li> This was a great price for the amount, and I love that the bottle has such a small opening for dispensing the oil, because it keeps it from being so messy (think of every olive oil bottle ever!).</li>
            <li> I highly recommend using it at bedtime</li>
            <li> this toner above that you made can also be used in your bath water for your body like to get rid of skin infections, body breakouts of any kind like, Eczema, Acne, Rashes, Mosquito/Bug Bites prepare the concoction as mentioned above and add about 100 ml or 3.51 fluid ounces of it into your bathing water).</li>
            <li> The oil can be emulsified (to mix with water) by adding normal dish washing liquid to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Neem is very powerful ( a little goes a long way) and it has a strong odor.</li>
            <li> I think that, because it is less dense than coconut oil - which I have used many times in the past, the hair strand absorbs it better.</li>
            <li> but you wouldnt want your hair or body to smell like it other than that its fine</li>
            <li> I mix barely half an ounce of this in a big spray bottle with a pump-ful of dish-washing soap (or sometimes shampoo) and then fill it with warm water.</li>
            <li> However, I mixed the Neem Oil into some Coconut Oil and put it onto my skin to keep mosquitoes away, and one darn skeeter landed right on my arm while the skin was still glistening of the Coconut-Neem-Oil-Mixture.</li>
            <li> I use a few drops of this mixed with mineral oi and lemongrass essential oil for a great natural bug spray.  </li>
            <li> bed bugs can live a year without feeding.</li>
            <li> I have tried numerous products and one prescription for this and nothing really helps much, but this is making an improvement.</li>
            <li> Stinks, but I am loving that I feel comfortable in my skin.</li>
            <li> Once you warm up though, watch out, it can clear a small room!  </li>
            <li> with these two soaps above #1 &amp; #2 I first wash my hands of course</li>
            <li> but something similar, it is not that solid but more of a creamier solid buttery type that is easier to dig away at than coconut.</li>
            <li> I just add an ounce to white vinegar in a pump sprayer, then had HOT water, pump it up and spray everything.  </li>
            <li> GETS RID OF HEAD LICE COMPLETELY!</li>
            <li> good and the smell not strong like other brand.</li>
            <li> then I filled a bucket with a slightly stronger mixture and went over the floors after every moping.</li>
            <li> It has not been tested to full extreme yet since fleas are not out in groves yet.  </li>
            <li> Completely luxurious feeling on your skin.  </li>
            <li> I want them to replace this oil smells old.</li>
            <li> but it does the job an is completely non toxic</li>
            <li> It may smell garlicky and smoky, but WOW does it work wonders.</li>
            <li> I had ordered the oil several months ago, so I was ready to see if it would work.</li>
            <li> skin is so soft after a night of applying neem combined with my lotion.  </li>
            <li> It hasn&#x27;t worked nearly as well as the neem, so we&#x27;re Getting another bottle.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve done so much research on this product over the last five months- in regards to the comment about causing infertility,</li>
            <li> me tell you, I do a lot of research online about alternative organic natural &amp; healthier treatments for everything &amp; when I found the herb Neem</li>
            <li> Also as an alternative for you people that love showers purchase one of those tiny for travel empty spray bottles &amp; pour the solution into it &amp; spray your entire body with it &amp; stay in shower for about 15 minutes without water on you &amp; then after 15 minutes, then wash it off &amp; continue your shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> on how to use and dilute Neem oil:&lt;br /&gt;I have listed some recipes / ways to use Neem oil below - but a rule of thumb to remember is to keep your dilution of of Neem oil to about 2 - 5% of any mixture that you apply directly onto your skin.</li>
            <li> Apply 1 drop of undiluted oil directly on warts once per day.</li>
            <li> Do not place in near boiling water, as it may reduce the effectiveness of the oil.ld that occur discontinue use.</li>
            <li> Do not place in near boiling water, as it may reduce the effectiveness of the oil.</li>
            <li> but I find it completely tolerable.  </li>
            <li> Smells, and makes everything smell, but it does help the skin and hair so far, in terms of health</li>
            <li> The \\&quot;odor\\&quot; fell below expectation and that probably helped a lot with liking this product SO FAR.  </li>
            <li> so the smell isn&#x27;t so much lingering inside the house as it did when I initially would spray it on them before stepping out.  </li>
            <li> Makes me smell like old garlic tho.  </li>
            <li> The Whole Foods next door to me does not even sell it in liquid form.</li>
            <li> I got a complete lice kit and it had the nit comb and worked well.</li>
            <li> neem oil in a cool dark place, away from sunlight.</li>
            <li> Store neem oil in a cool dark place, away from sunlight.</li>
            <li> , my 14 yr old Golden Retriever, McKenzie, with chronic skin allergies and both McKenzie &amp; my Peke, Max suffering from severe allergic reaction to flea bites - I&#x27;ll take the smell and the constant oily fur anytime so long as it offers relief from the torment of itchy skin.  </li>
            <li> Diatomaceous Earth was such a huge let down</li>
            <li> As Neem oil has a rather strong smell you might want to add a few drops of your essential oil to any mixture to mask the smell.</li>
            <li> As Neem oil has a rather strong smell you might want to add a few drops of your essential oil to any mixture to mask the smell.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice big bottle and should last a couple of years at least.</li>
            <li> My husband loves the way it makes his psoriasis calm down and</li>
            <li> The oil feels raw and fresh!</li>
            <li> It has a strong small, slightly reminiscent of peanuts.</li>
            <li> I had a run in with scabies a while back and tried almost everything I could find to help clear them up.  </li>
            <li> I did the walls around the bed, the bed, furniture, in short, I sprayed everything and anything near our evening sitting or sleeping areas.</li>
            <li> but you should mix it with another oil because putting neem directly on you without mixing can actually irritate your skin.</li>
            <li> This is my second bottle of Neem Old that I have ordered from Coastal Scents.</li>
            <li> It solidifies at cool temperatures and becomes very uneven in texture and couldn&#x27;t be squeezed out of the bottle unless thoroughly warmed up and liquified.</li>
            <li> If you have thin, brittle hair, apply it once a week, leave it on as long as you can stand the smell which, like many have said, is a combination of peanuts and garlic, and soon you will notice a considerable improvement.</li>
            <li> I can work outside without being eaten alive by these giant country bugs we have out here in the woods.</li>
            <li> I suffer from adult acne, and I&#x27;ve noticed an overall decrease in my facial skin being red and breaking out while receiving an improvement in the texture of it.</li>
            <li> a concoction of A Tablespoon of #3 (Ground Neem Leaf Powder) in a half liter or about 4 cups of Distilled Purified water till the water (that only cost me a dollar or two for a gallon at Walmart) turns green (Which is about 30 minutes, I first brought it to a boil &amp; (all the time I kept stirring), then I immediately turned it down to low heat to simmer for about 30 minutes, then I take it off the stove &amp; let it sit with top still on to steep for about an hour or two until it cools down).</li>
            <li> The product is very thick; just warm a little in the microwave.</li>
            <li> Effective but stinks to the high heavens.&lt;br /&gt;Expect to get banished to the couch and odd looks throughout the day if you do not wash it all out.</li>
            <li> Learned it should be refrigerated to extend the shelf life, so I divided mine into small units to avoid heating up the whole thing time after time.</li>
            <li> Now there no more thanks to this product&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li> Add a few drops to your normal pet shampoo</li>
            <li> My husband has really dry and cracked feet, and this stuff helps to soften and aid in sloughing off the extra skin that builds up.</li>
            <li> I ended up getting the prescription cream from the doctor which finally killed them, but then I was left post Permethrin skin issues that took forever to clear up.  </li>

            <li> I had heard it smelled bad, kind of like</li>
            <li> Neem oil has thousands of uses from hair care, antiseptic, lice killer and horse fly repellent spray.</li>
            <li> or you will smell like curry or food all day long.</li>
            <li> I think a carrier oil and some masking essential oils would help but have never really tried that out.  </li>
            <li> Not wild about the smell, myself.</li>
            <li> /&gt;â€¢Cuts, wounds, minor skin disorders and mosquito and insect repellant &#x27;Mix with Vaseline or a carrier oil in a ratio of 1:5 and apply to affected area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Repeat once weekly for 3 weeks or as long as the problem</li>
            <li> Watch carefully for any possible irritation, and should that occur discontinue use.</li>
            <li> My point is, I won&#x27;t promise that Neem oil will totally kill scabies mites as I used it in conjunction with other products.  </li>
            <li> Now I CAN GROW LONG HAIR AGAIN!...</li>
            <li> My child had head lice and very long hair.</li>
            <li> But she has very long hair</li>
            <li> We have used it on our horse that had dry skin on her nose.  </li>
            <li> I recommend mixing with eucalyptus or tea-tree essential oils to help cut the smell to something less offensive.</li>
            <li> We had lice and put a little neem oil in our regular shampoo.</li>
            <li> Smells too bad to be able to use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard many people complain about the smell of neem oil, but this one isn&#x27;t bad.</li>
            <li> Why only a few days?  </li>
            <li> I leave it out for a few hours, shake it well and replenish my smaller bottler with a dropper.....</li>
            <li> &amp; then I keep my palms wet</li>
            <li> &amp; I squirt 1(Neem Foaming Face Wash) squirt into my wet palm</li>
            <li> &#x27;Add a few drops to your regular shampoo.&lt;br</li>
            <li> So I remembered neem oil being in a lice kit I bought that was advertised as being used by the military years ago.</li>
            <li> After he was dry, i mixed a small amount with a carrier oil (argan), and applied to cotton ball.</li>
            <li> (Personally we have found that plain baby shampoo works</li>
            <li> I use this for my face because it doesn&#x27;t break me out like the other oils or body butters I use on my skin.</li>
            <li> And, yeah, the smell is not pretty</li>
            <li> I mixed 1 part neem to 3 parts water and a small squirt of dish soap in a spray bottle.</li>
            <li> Due to the smell I don&#x27;t use it as often as I&#x27;d like.</li>
            <li> I have not tried it for any other purpose.</li>
            <li> I then found out it can be used to kill fleas and other pests and prevent reinfestations.</li>
            <li> I just have not used it because I have not had to because of the below other non smelly NEEM product that I purchase here on Amazon below.</li>

            <li> The list is endless.</li>
            <li> Mixes well with Lavender or Lilac oil and other oils to dilute the often pungent smell.</li>
            <li> All insects, slugs, snails, larvae, and other pests are gone.</li>
            <li> I will probably experiment with other uses..</li>
            <li> So I only use it when I&#x27;m not going out or at night and just deal with it as the overall benefits have outweighed the not great smell.</li>
            <li> I watered this down and used it to keep the bugs out of my garden this year.</li>
            <li> I mean I wouldn&#x27;t lather myself up and go out in public or anything</li>
            <li> I had a major infestation of aphids on my peas this years, and i prefer not to use any chemicals (and being that they were on the chicken fence, i had no other options).</li>
            <li> I do think the slightly obnoxious smell repelled mosquitos, but I would not wear it when I am going to be around people, or else</li>
            <li> Should skin irritation occur, discontinue use, or make mixture with less Neem oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Should skin irritation occur, discontinue use, or make mixture with less Neem oil.  </li>
            <li> Yes Neem oil has a garlicky or slight burnt peanut odor.</li>
            <li> ~ALL TRACES OF ME EVER HAVING SHINGLES WAS GONE IN LESS</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s not poisoning my little doggie.</li>
            <li> &amp; then I squeeze a little of number #2</li>
            <li> Anyway, heat up a little of the neem oil</li>
            <li> IF YOU MIX IT WITH A LITTLE SHAMPOO OR BODY WASH, THE SCENT GOES AWAY.</li>
            <li> SHORTLY AFTER I BOUGHT THIS PRODUCT, I CAME DOWN WITH THE SHINGLES!!!!</li>
            <li> I guess tha rating might not be fair, becasue I had never seen this oil before, so can&#x27;t compare, but it stinks so bad that I ended up not using it.</li>
            <li> I used this for a few days on every place I had itchy raised bumps.  </li>

            <li> My daughter suffers from eczema, and this stuff gets rid of the red rough texture patches she gets on her body.</li>
            <li> From all the reviews I read previous to purchase the predominant complaint was the \\&quot;bad\\&quot; smell.  </li>
            <li> The smell from this oil is truly atrocious, but it works very well for virtually every skin condition that I&#x27;ve come across.</li>
            <li> My aphid problem is no more, and it also kills mold too.</li>
            <li> I have read that lice do not like the smell of neem, and we are now almost a month with no more signs of head lice.</li>
            <li> So I expected a lot worse.  </li>
            <li> My tip is to use it in the shower put it on whatever and massage it for a couple of minutes then wash as usual.</li>
            <li> and I opened it and put it all in a small container.</li>
            <li> No more infections/root canals.</li>
            <li> No more bleeding from gingivitis and no more periodontal disease.</li>
            <li> Only complaint is that the squeeze-hole lid is useless and gets oil all over the bottle.</li>
            <li> We put antibiotic ointment on the spot and it made her raw!  </li>
            <li> The only reason that I posted here because I read all of these reviews here for this product &amp; everyone wants to use the herb NEEM, but this smell of this oil here makes it almost impossible because of how bad it smells</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to believe I haven&#x27;t been to the dentist in almost a year.</li>
            <li> keep it up at least once a month.</li>
            <li> I have been having to buy to buy it on ebay lately as Amazon has been out of it forever.</li>
            <li> However, it will very doubtfully cause any problems with a woman&#x27;s fertility unless she is ingesting capsules regularly and putting the oil directly on or in her genitals.</li>
            <li> reviewers complained about the smell.</li>
            <li> (This stuff isn&#x27;t poison, it works by confusing the bugs from eating and mating.</li>
            <li> I weighed the benefits with the negative smell and decided to try it.  </li>
            <li> It is a thick, rather goopy oil.</li>
            <li> It does smell really bad; that&#x27;s why I am only giving it a 4 star.</li>
            <li> apply above (#4 Organix, Theraneem Skin Lotion) to your face &amp; then that&#x27;s it, but if my skin is really bad, then I will after I apply this lotion, then I will put my face into my steamer</li>

            <li> This is the Worst smelling oil i have ever use after i has put it on my skin for the first time</li>
            <li> &amp; my version of treatments you can (if your a lady) use under your makeup or for everyone else by itself or with a moisturizer &amp; it will not smell bad or smell up your cloths, bedding or smell bad for other people to smell that&#x27;s standing next to you.</li>
            <li> so I had prepared, BUT Neem Oil really smells horrible!!</li>
            <li> Also, please don&#x27;t let your poor, unsuspecting boyfriend kiss your cheek when you have this on; it tastes like poo.</li>
            <li> Based on the dramatic reviews, I was expecting something unbearably foul.</li>
            <li> Even now I still get red itchy bumps from time to time in the places I had the worst issues.  </li>
            <li> It does have a silly smell to it.  </li>
            <li> The thought of putting the questionable oil onto my face turns me off.</li>
            <li> I plan to put a few drops in homemade bug repellent for the family and pets.</li>
            <li> This is cold pressed,virgin oil without processing.</li>
            <li> yes it stinks</li>
            <li> Yes, it stinks, and it&#x27;s supposed to.</li>

            <li> I have used it on my skin and although the smell is pungent its not that unpleasant to me....</li>
            <li> Smells bad.</li>
            <li> , well I wanted to post another way to use NEEM, but with out using smelly stuff like this as an option because NEEM does not have to smell this bad.</li>
            <li> Smell isn&#x27;t as bad as some complain.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t kill them, but the smell is sooooo bad that it makes them leave my garden alone.</li>
            <li> Lots of oil, doesn&#x27;t smell that bad</li>
            <li> Even helped to repel some of the flies we&#x27;ve had so bad this year.</li>
            <li> IT TASTE LIKE CRAP and lingers..</li>
            <li> I have also used it for a flea repellent and it worked well for too.</li>
            <li> The oil has a very bad smell, it should not smell like this.</li>
            <li> However, I did think it helped with the worst of the itchy/dry</li>
            <li> Smelled terrible!</li>
            <li> It worked at treating my son&#x27;s foot fungus, but the smell is horrible.</li>
            <li> If you have ever to battle this evil bug</li>
            <li> It is something that you would have to wash it off after you apply &amp; let it sit on your skin because it smells awful.</li>

            <li> good for the ears and garden</li>
            <li> There are times when I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s going on with my skin.  A few weeks ago, I started getting itchy bumps in random patches.  I thought scabies but I could not be certain.  I don&#x27;t have exposure risk to scabies so I doubted it.  But I was getting ongoing bumps and itchiness.  After a couple of weeks, I was reading about Neem Oil.  I tried the stuff I had on hand which is for fruit trees.  After a day of use, I decided the non-active ingredient for agricultural pesticide use is probably not in my best interest.  I ordered Coastal Scents Neem Oil.  I used this for a few days on every place I had itchy raised bumps.  Why only a few days?  The itching and the new formation of bumps were gone!  Neem Oil has a purported multitude of uses.  I think it&#x27;s nice to have on hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just FYI.  I noticed this oil had a bunch of globules in it.  I read that you might have to heat it up to get it all to liquify.  Sure enough, it is fall now, and the bottle looks and feels like the contents are butter!</li>
            <li> The product is very thick; just warm a little in the microwave. I added it to my dog&#x27;s shampoo, and the fleas died immediately upon contact. After he was dry, i mixed a small amount with a carrier oil (argan), and applied to cotton ball. I spotted it on his skin, and the fleas have stayed at bay since. It&#x27;s a little stinky, but as far as being effective, it&#x27;s great. After spending hundreds of dollars on Advantix/Advantage/Frontline and Seresto, this actually works! And it&#x27;s not poisoning my little doggie. Love it!</li>
            <li> Works for insect repellant!</li>
            <li> If you know what you are buying,  this is a great buy. Neem oil is great for a lot of uses. .... but not fragrance. Believe it or not,  you do get used to the smell,  because the benefits are worth it!</li>
            <li> I guess tha rating might not be fair, becasue I had never seen this oil before, so can&#x27;t compare, but it stinks so bad that I ended up not using it.</li>
            <li> Completely luxurious feeling on your skin.  If used undiluted, on your whole body, it smells alright (herbaceous, like a good cooking ingredient).  Once you warm up though, watch out, it can clear a small room!  I recommend diluting it with other, better smelling ingredients, then the scent won&#x27;t be noticed regardless of body temperature.</li>
            <li> Good quality oil.  I use to control my pup&#x27;s chronic demodex mange.  Messy and a bit odorous, but really provides relief.</li>
            <li> Smells too bad to be able to use.</li>
            <li> The oil has a very bad smell, it should not smell like this. I want them to replace this oil smells old.</li>
            <li> Buyer beware. This item probably works well but smells so bad...and no amount of perfume disguises the smell. Whenever you apply it be sure to rinse it out or you will smell like curry or food all day long.</li>
            <li> The smell from this oil is truly atrocious, but it works very well for virtually every skin condition that I&#x27;ve come across. My daughter suffers from eczema, and this stuff gets rid of the red rough texture patches she gets on her body. I suffer from adult acne, and I&#x27;ve noticed an overall decrease in my facial skin being red and breaking out while receiving an improvement in the texture of it. My husband has really dry and cracked feet, and this stuff helps to soften and aid in sloughing off the extra skin that builds up. It also does wonders for any rash you get on your body! This is very concentrated stuff, so you will need to dilute it. I would definitely purchase this product again in the future.</li>
            <li> I am happy that I found this oil for my hair and my scalp</li>
            <li> Superb buy. I hope it will become available again.</li>
            <li> I use this for my face because it doesn&#x27;t break me out like the other oils or body butters I use on my skin. The garlic like smell dissipates after a few minutes.&lt;br /&gt;I also love the fact that it keeps mosquitoes away during the summer months. So I am never without this product and I&#x27;m here to purchase three more bottles.</li>
            <li> I had a run in with scabies a while back and tried almost everything I could find to help clear them up.  I ended up getting the prescription cream from the doctor which finally killed them, but then I was left post Permethrin skin issues that took forever to clear up.  Even now I still get red itchy bumps from time to time in the places I had the worst issues.  My point is, I won&#x27;t promise that Neem oil will totally kill scabies mites as I used it in conjunction with other products.  However, I did think it helped with the worst of the itchy/dry/tear your skin off your body feelings that I was having and seemed to help my skin heal after the mites were actually dead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The main thing people complain about with Neem oil is the smell.  And, yeah, the smell is not pretty and I find that it lingers.  I would agree with most people that I&#x27;ve seen and compare it to garlicky-oniony peanuts.  Ewww.  I think a carrier oil and some masking essential oils would help but have never really tried that out.  So I only use it when I&#x27;m not going out or at night and just deal with it as the overall benefits have outweighed the not great smell.</li>
            <li> This is the Worst smelling oil i have ever use after i has put it on my skin for the first time i though i will not be using it again but in the morning my skin appear brighter and was software i guess beauty really pain will be using often now thank</li>
            <li> Excellent and unbelievable delivery and quality product.</li>
            <li> Great Oil!! Works wonders keeping mosquitoes away!</li>
            <li> I mixed 1 part neem to 3 parts water and a small squirt of dish soap in a spray bottle. I did the walls around the bed, the bed, furniture, in short, I sprayed everything and anything near our evening sitting or sleeping areas. then I filled a bucket with a slightly stronger mixture and went over the floors after every moping. keep it up at least once a month. bed bugs can live a year without feeding. I mix 2 tablespoons neem to a quart of water to spray on the dogs and they no longer need flea meds at all!  I spent over 1000,00 in 6 months and never went more than a couple of weeks without someone being fed on, and all I needed was this??? They seen me coming. I have been having to buy to buy it on ebay lately as Amazon has been out of it forever. Hope they get it back soon.</li>
            <li> Have used to prepare homemade neem ointment for my son for atopic dermatitis and it seems to work. This is cold pressed,virgin oil without processing. I see some sediments at the bottom upon storage. i am wondering whether I should filter it to remove it. Has anybody else experienced this? I wish it was packaged in a glass bottle and that is the reason for knocking a star off.</li>
            <li> I bought this neem oil because I heard about its beneficial uses particular in hair and scalp issues and that it would help with premature graying of hair. I had heard it smelled bad, kind of like burn peanuts so I had prepared, BUT Neem Oil really smells horrible!! Due to the smell I don&#x27;t use it as often as I&#x27;d like. Even after washing it out I can smell it on my hair, however it does help my scalp health. I shake the bottle and put neem oil on my scalp and massage it to stimulate hair growth, and I usually use almond oil on the rest of my hair which is amazing. Overall this product worked well, but I dislike the scent a lot!!</li>
            <li> Great product! I am using this for a stubborn toenail fungus and it seems to be helping. I have tried numerous products and one prescription for this and nothing really helps much, but this is making an improvement. So, in about 12 months I hope my nail will be healthy, it has already healed the smaller toenails after 5 weeks. I keep this in the refrigerator to keep it fresh. It does solidify so I leave it out for a few hours, shake it well and replenish my smaller bottler with a dropper.....love this stuff. I have not tried it for any other purpose. It smells, but I would doubt the quality if it didn&#x27;t smell.</li>
            <li> VERY happy with this oil. This was a great price for the amount, and I love that the bottle has such a small opening for dispensing the oil, because it keeps it from being so messy (think of every olive oil bottle ever!). I have mixed this with soapy water with essential oils to rid bugs on my herbs and it has already gotten rid of them in 3 days with spraying them twice a day. I put about 2 tablespoons in a large spray bottle, then soapy water. It smells kind of like garlic/oregano oil, so it isn&#x27;t incredibly pleasant if you use it indoors. I haven&#x27;t sprayed it in a day, and when I watered them most of the smell disappeared. I plan to put a few drops in homemade bug repellent for the family and pets. Very happy!</li>
            <li> Great product, AWESOME price! I use this in my garden, and when mixed properly, it works AMAZING!</li>
            <li> I had heard Neem oil was good, so I bought this.  I do think the slightly obnoxious smell repelled mosquitos, but I would not wear it when I am going to be around people, or else I might repel them, which I would not care to do.  Probably a very good oil-- good texture and flow.  Not wild about the smell, myself.</li>
            <li> The scent of this is horrendous. Bleh.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work for scabies at all. And it&#x27;s a huge bottle, so you might want to try something else if your problem is scabies.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and in great condition. Great amount for the price. Use this on my face at night only because it smells too strong to wear out.</li>
            <li> This appears to be effective at treating my scalp itching/flaking from some undiagnosed dermatological issue.... Now I CAN GROW LONG HAIR AGAIN!... It also appears to be effective at healing/soothing other dermatitis like irritations from heat allergy. Stinks, but I am loving that I feel comfortable in my skin.</li>
            <li> Arrived just as described.</li>
            <li> Smelled terrible! Smelled like onions and the odor stuck around for days.  I ended up using it to make soap and added a lot of essential oil to cover the odor as best as I could.</li>
            <li> Mixed a safe &amp;#34;pesticide&amp;#34; spray for my fruit trees, worked pretty well and I only used it once. There is enough here for years of application. It smells a bit like funky greens and peanuts but it does the job an is completely non toxic so hey, ill buy it again when i need more.</li>
            <li> I use a few drops of this mixed with mineral oi and lemongrass essential oil for a great natural bug spray.  I can work outside without being eaten alive by these giant country bugs we have out here in the woods.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using a mixture of warm water, a few drops dish soap, and a squirt of neem oil and spraying it in my garden. My aphid problem is no more, and it also kills mold too. Plus this bottle will last FOREVER, so it was a really, really good buy.</li>
            <li> I love all things Neem, and this oil is SUPER EFFECTIVE! I use this neem oil mixed with my acne medication at night. It may smell garlicky and smoky, but WOW does it work wonders. Zaps my zits, keeps the moquitoe(s?) in my room away from my face and neck at night, and seems to have helped with my dandruff when mixed into my conditioner. I recommend mixing with eucalyptus or tea-tree essential oils to help cut the smell to something less offensive.</li>
            <li> Large bottle of real neem oil at a greAt price. It seems to be helping with acne. Smells bad. Doesn&#x27;t bother me too much but I wouldn&#x27;t want anyone else to smell it so I only use at night. The next morning after sleeping with neem oil on my son gave me a kiss  and told me I smell stinky.</li>
            <li> This product arrived quickly and as described. It is a thick, rather goopy oil. I&#x27;ve heard many people complain about the smell of neem oil, but this one isn&#x27;t bad. Its not the most pleasant smell in the world but its not that strong.</li>
            <li> It worked at treating my son&#x27;s foot fungus, but the smell is horrible. Make sure you use other carrier oils to neutralize the smell.</li>
            <li> great in my facial soap</li>
            <li> This is a great oil for the price. I use it to make soap and it works wonderfully - although it does stink</li>
            <li> I discovered neen oil a couple of months ago while I was doing research online looking for treatment of head lice. If you have ever to battle this evil bug you know what a nightmare it is. All I can say is look no further!!! Anytime I buy a product off of the internet I always research the product, and read many reviews. Other than the smell all I read was great things about this oil. If you are a mom or dad trying to conquer head lice you have found your product. Three weeks ago my daughter came home with her first bout of head lice. I had ordered the oil several months ago, so I was ready to see if it would work. I applied the oil all over her head, and place a shower cap on to help with the smell. I let the oil sit on her head for twenty minutes, and then had her wash it out. Needless to say it killed all of the bugs, and helped loosen the knits so I could comb through her hair. After successfully getting rid of the pest I still have her add a small amount of neem to her shampoo twice a week . I have read that lice do not like the smell of neem, and we are now almost a month with no more signs of head lice. I will have plenty of this product on hand!</li>
            <li> This oil seems like a great quality and definitely works for its intended purpose as an ingredient in an organic spray to control red lily beetles (thank goodness I finally found something that works--it was really my last resort before just pulling out all my lilies).  I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase and my lilies have never looked better!</li>
            <li> This has kept my lemon tree healthy!  Its so big now I got a 1/2 gallon sprayer.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described:)</li>
            <li> Good quality product and excellent price. I will purchase from this vendor again.</li>
            <li> Works well to repel Mosquitos when combined with lavender and lemongrass. This oil tends to thicken if it gets too cool. Just run it under warm water and shake well. It has a very unique but bearable scent if used alone but you should mix it with another oil because putting neem directly on you without mixing can actually irritate your skin.</li>
            <li> It has a strong small, slightly reminiscent of peanuts. We use it on our cat to repel fleas. Can&#x27;t tell if it&#x27;s working yet, because she still has some fleas. I&#x27;m giving it time, though, because it will probably take daily applications over weeks to see results. The fleas are lessening, but we are using this in combination with a flea comb.</li>
            <li> I first bought this years ago to help with my psoriasis. I then found out it can be used to kill fleas and other pests and prevent reinfestations. I have also used it instead of permethrin lotion to get rid of scabies I got during a massage. It does smell really bad; that&#x27;s why I am only giving it a 4 star. I would use this for lice treatment, also.</li>
            <li> I just received this product and I really like it.  I bought it to help combat a mite problem and it works beautifully.  I have used it on my skin and although the smell is pungent its not that unpleasant to me....it fades quickly.  It does smell somewhat of peanuts....&lt;br /&gt;my skin is so soft after a night of applying neem combined with my lotion.  The fact that it helps with insects is great for the summer, if it wards off gnats or mosquito&#x27;s this will be my new best friend.</li>
            <li> I am now trying this product I do not have any good news for now, perhaps later.I bought this product by the recommendations of Amazon customers who have using this product......</li>
            <li> Seems to keep pests and molds away from my garden well. I use a tablespoon of oil mixed in a liter of water, in a sprayer, ans soak the leaves of my plants.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend and I have had scabies for almost eight months now. Neem has worked the best at keeping the f***ers at bay, but we haven&#x27;t been adamant enough with it, I don&#x27;t think, to fully conquer them once and for all. After finishing a 16oz bottle of neem which we applied to ourselves every night before getting into a bed of clean sheets, we ran out and I bought a bottle of 10% permethrin. The doctors prescribe one dose of 5% permethrin, so after three rounds of that which didn&#x27;t work, I tried the insecticide/garden grade stuff. It hasn&#x27;t worked nearly as well as the neem, so we&#x27;re Getting another bottle. I&#x27;ve done so much research on this product over the last five months- in regards to the comment about causing infertility, yes, that&#x27;s how it kills mites and bugs. It screws up their reproductive cycle so they can no longer reproduce, and they die off. However, it will very doubtfully cause any problems with a woman&#x27;s fertility unless she is ingesting capsules regularly and putting the oil directly on or in her genitals. While I wasn&#x27;t using the stuff before I became pregnant, I&#x27;ve been using it throughout my pregnancy to try and get rid of all of the scabies before the baby comes, and it hasn&#x27;t done any harm to either of us.</li>
            <li> Smell strong like garlic but does a great job on skin and hair.</li>
            <li> Use this to make my own organic pest spray for my horses, 3 other ingredients and you have a very effective, environmentally safe, non toxic fly spray.  I even use it on myself before trail rides.</li>
            <li> First let me start by saying I did not use this Neem oil that this review is for because of the smell &amp; I found an easier non smelly way to use Neem, but without using this smelly oil. &amp; my version of treatments you can (if your a lady) use under your makeup or for everyone else by itself or with a moisturizer &amp; it will not smell bad or smell up your cloths, bedding or smell bad for other people to smell that&#x27;s standing next to you. Read what I did below. The only reason that I posted here because I read all of these reviews here for this product &amp; everyone wants to use the herb NEEM, but this smell of this oil here makes it almost impossible because of how bad it smells, well I wanted to post another way to use NEEM, but with out using smelly stuff like this as an option because NEEM does not have to smell this bad. I gave it 5 stars because I have not used it yet &amp; I like all NEEM &amp; I know this stuff probably works for getting rid of infections of all kinds on the skin, but I did purchase it. I just have not used it because I have not had to because of the below other non smelly NEEM product that I purchase here on Amazon below. Here&#x27;s How Read Below.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me tell you, I do a lot of research online about alternative organic natural &amp; healthier treatments for everything &amp; when I found the herb Neem I finally found the holy grail for clearing breakouts of all kinds like to get rid of skin infections on face or for body you need to prepare the concoction that I mentioned below (on #3) and add about 100 ml or 3.51 fluid ounces of it to your bathing water to treat Acne, Rashes, Mosquito/Bug Bites &amp; it really works. But I did not use only it, let me tell you what I did. I purchased here on Amazon 5 Neem products:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;#1.) Neem Foaming Face Wash - 150 ml Price: $12.99 [[ASIN:B003OPE57C Neem Foaming Face Wash - 150 ml]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;#2.) Soothing Therape Neem Liquid Soap Organix South 16 oz Liquid Price:&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B00BPMCPC8 Soothing Therape Neem Liquid Soap Organix South 16 oz Liquid]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(So with these two soaps above #1 &amp; #2 I first wash my hands of course &amp; then I keep my palms wet &amp; I squirt 1(Neem Foaming Face Wash) squirt into my wet palm &amp; then I squeeze a little of number #2 (Therape Neem Liquid Soap ) into the same palm &amp; then I mix in my hands &amp; wash my face &amp; after rinsing. I put together the #3rd product before time, so I can always have it in the fridge ready to be used as my neem toner that I found on a website &amp; it works perfectly. Here it is:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;#3.) Neem Leaf Powder Organic Certified Healthfuze 16 oz Price: $18.97&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B00CACOPC0 Neem Leaf Powder Organic Certified Healthfuze 16 oz 1lb]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Boil a concoction of A Tablespoon of #3 (Ground Neem Leaf Powder) in a half liter or about 4 cups of Distilled Purified water till the water (that only cost me a dollar or two for a gallon at Walmart) turns green (Which is about 30 minutes, I first brought it to a boil &amp; (all the time I kept stirring), then I immediately turned it down to low heat to simmer for about 30 minutes, then I take it off the stove &amp; let it sit with top still on to steep for about an hour or two until it cools down). Then I pour to store it into a glass bottle or two (I used two glass bottles that I repurposed). Use this liquid as a skin toner by just dipping a cotton-ball into it and wiping your face with it every night. Regular usage will help in clearing acne, scars, pigmentation and blackheads. ATTENTION* (Don&#x27;t forget to refridgerate this Neem Toner that you just made.

            <li> I watered this down and used it to keep the bugs out of my garden this year. It worked very well and we got the best zucchini and cucumber crop this year. It doesn&#x27;t keep all the bugs away but it&#x27;s a much better that using pesticides</li>
            <li> this oil will become one of our go to lotions for dailey use.  My husband loves the way it makes his psoriasis calm down and even more, it keeps mosquitos away outside.  We have used it on our horse that had dry skin on her nose.  Very helpful</li>
            <li> Neem oil smells horrible, but that is just the nature of the oil. The quality of this particular product is great though, you wont be dissapointed</li>
            <li> Good price for this product.  Only gave three stars because of the plastic bottling.&lt;br /&gt;Such strong herbal medicine leaches chemicals from plastic.  But I do recommend it at the price I paid.</li>
            <li> Worked well on skin but smelled horrible</li>
            <li> Amazing value, effective product for both personal use and in the garden.</li>
            <li> The odor is really not so bad. Yes, it has a kind of slightly garlicky peanut scent to it, but it goes away fast, and even though I am not crazy about the smell, I do not find it to be a nuisance to the nose. However, I mixed the Neem Oil into some Coconut Oil and put it onto my skin to keep mosquitoes away, and one darn skeeter landed right on my arm while the skin was still glistening of the Coconut-Neem-Oil-Mixture. BUMMER! I guess I am still too delicious for mosquitoes. But as I have two dogs, I hope the oil will keep mites, fleas and ticks away. We will see.</li>
            <li> Yes, it is stinky. You&#x27;re not going to smell like a rose using this. I highly recommend using it at bedtime so you don&#x27;t actually have to smell like this during the day. Also, please don&#x27;t let your poor, unsuspecting boyfriend kiss your cheek when you have this on; it tastes like poo. But, it does work very well. I use it both as a skin moisturizer and to keep pests out of my garden. I had a major infestation of aphids on my peas this years, and i prefer not to use any chemicals (and being that they were on the chicken fence, i had no other options). Anyway, heat up a little of the neem oil so it mixes together, put it in a spray bottle with water, and in a couple days all the aphids were gone and my peas then produced! I&#x27;d recommend it.</li>
            <li> Effective but stinks to the high heavens.&lt;br /&gt;Expect to get banished to the couch and odd looks throughout the day if you do not wash it all out.</li>
            <li> Cannot believe this Neem oil.. had never heard of it before... had a problem with fleas,  and on contact, this Neems oil kills!&lt;br /&gt;Just amazing, purchased and viewed at Amazon.. Never be without Neems oil again!</li>
            <li> I purchased Coastal Scents Neem Oil, 16.90 Fluid Ounce. I was able to purchase this product at a discounted rate for my honest and unbiased opinion. I am in no way affiliated with the maker or seller of this product. I find that the uses are endless.&lt;br /&gt;Tips on how to use and dilute Neem oil:&lt;br /&gt;I have listed some recipes / ways to use Neem oil below - but a rule of thumb to remember is to keep your dilution of of Neem oil to about 2 - 5% of any mixture that you apply directly onto your skin. Some of the recipes below use higher percentages - but keep a lookout for any skin irritation.&lt;br /&gt;â€¢Cuts, wounds, minor skin disorders and mosquito and insect repellant &#x27;Mix with Vaseline or a carrier oil in a ratio of 1:5 and apply to affected area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;â€¢Athleteâ€™s foot &#x27;Add 15 ml to warm water and soak the feet in this preparation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;â€¢Head lice &#x27;Mix 50/50 with a carrier oil and massage into the hair and scalp. Leave on for 1 hour and shampoo. Repeat once weekly for 3 weeks or as long as the problem persists.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;â€¢Stop mosquitoes breeding &#x27;Spray or pour oil on all breeding areas. The oil can be emulsified (to mix with water) by adding normal dish washing liquid to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;â€¢Plant protection &#x27;Add 30 ml to 1 liter of water and add 1 ml of dishwashing liquid. Mix well and spray immediately for plant protection. Do not store the mixture; make fresh formulation for each spray. Spray the mixture on top of all the leaves and on the undersides where insects often hide â€“ you can also spray it around the roots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;â€¢Lamp oil to ward off mosquitoes &#x27;Add 5 â€“ 10% oil to any lamp oil and burn lamp normally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;â€¢Dandruff and itchy scalp &#x27;Add a few drops to your regular shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;â€¢Ticks and fleas on animals &#x27;Add a few drops to your normal pet shampoo (ratio should be 30 ml (1 oz.) to 240 ml (8 oz.) shampoo). (Personally we have found that plain baby shampoo works the best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;â€¢Warts &#x27;Apply 1 drop of undiluted oil directly on warts once per day. Watch carefully for any possible irritation, and should that occur discontinue use. Continue for 2-3 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;â€¢Psoriasis, cold sores, eczema, athletes foot, skin ulcers and other fungal skin conditions&#x27;Mix 1 tablespoon (15 ml) with 4 ounces (120 ml) carrier oil such as jojoba or grape seed oil and apply twice a day to affected skin. Should skin irritation occur, discontinue use, or make mixture with less Neem oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;â€¢Pet and livestock spray for ticks, fleas, mange mites and other pests &#x27;Mix 1 ounce (30 ml) oil with 1 gallon (3.8 liter) water and add a few drops of dishwashing liquid (to emulsify the oil). Place mixture into a spray bottle or other type of sprayer, and spray animals once every two weeks. (This mixture can be used on indoor and outdoor plants as well as flowers and vegetables.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;â€¢Cleaning the house &#x27;Add to carpet shampoos and spray mattresses to kill dust mites.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;â€¢Hand wash &#x27;Add a couple of drops to liquid hand soap for antibacterial properties.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;â€¢FOR ALL THE ABOVE &#x27;As Neem oil has a rather strong smell you might want to add a few drops of your essential oil to any mixture to mask the smell. Lavender or lemongrass essential oils work well â€“ but you could add your personal favorite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Store neem oil in a cool dark place, away from sunlight. Neem oil can easily solidify - even at low room temperatures. Should this happen put the bottle in warm water (below 95 degree F) to liquefy. Do not place in near boiling water, as it may reduce the effectiveness of the oil.ld that occur discontinue use. Continue for 2-3 weeks.  â€¢Psoriasis, cold sores, eczema, athletes foot, skin ulcers and other fungal skin conditionsMix 1 tablespoon (15 ml) with 4 ounces (120 ml) carrier oil such as jojoba or grape seed oil and apply twice a day to affected skin. Should skin irritation occur, discontinue use, or make mixture with less Neem oil.  â€¢Pet and livestock spray for ticks, fleas, mange mites and other pests Mix 1 ounce (30 ml) oil with 1 gallon (3.8 liter) water and add a few drops of dishwashing liquid (to emulsify the oil).

            <li> Great stuff!  I use this Neem Oil on my plants....a couple tablespoons in a quart or two of water with a couple teaspoons of Dawn dish detergent, spray on the leaves...no bugs on my plants! Don&#x27;t apply it after the plant blooms because you don&#x27;t want to offend/kill the bees! Also great on hair and scalp....apply before getting into the shower, then shower/shampoo as usual.  It does have a strong smell but I find it completely tolerable.  After the shampoo the scent is eliminated pretty much...but your hair/scalp is soft, conditioned and it feels great!</li>
            <li> love this.  Use it in the garden for pest and fungus control.  Works really well.</li>
            <li> Smells, and makes everything smell, but it does help the skin and hair so far, in terms of health, I do not know if it worked as a bug repellant, but I haven&#x27;t been dealing with pests.</li>
            <li> Nice concentration. It allowed me to mix it for use in my garden and in personal care solutions.</li>
            <li> Have to say I love this stuff.  It does have a silly smell to it.  But it works.</li>
            <li> We had lice and put a little neem oil in our regular shampoo. Works wonderfully! Also makes your hair super shiny and strong. Smell &#x3D; not so good though.</li>
            <li> The \\&quot;odor\\&quot; fell below expectation and that probably helped a lot with liking this product SO FAR.  From all the reviews I read previous to purchase the predominant complaint was the \\&quot;bad\\&quot; smell.  So I expected a lot worse.  Well, if that&#x27;s all we have to contend with but it brings comfort to my boys, my 14 yr old Golden Retriever, McKenzie, with chronic skin allergies and both McKenzie &amp; my Peke, Max suffering from severe allergic reaction to flea bites - I&#x27;ll take the smell and the constant oily fur anytime so long as it offers relief from the torment of itchy skin.  It has not been tested to full extreme yet since fleas are not out in groves yet.  But summer is upon us so in about a week or 2 I hope that it will prove that I have finally found the effective natural flea repellant that I have soooo long been in search of.  Diatomaceous Earth was such a huge let down and now I am stuck with a huge 25 lb box and trying to give it away to every neighbor and stranger I can talk into taking some.  This is my 1st ever purchase of Neem oil &amp; I use it to turn into a homemade shampoo solution and an anti-flea spray ( [...])  this particular brand seems to be 100% pure as advertised and I hope NEEM Oil provides the much needed relief for McKenzie and Max.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Follow-up review:  It&#x27;s now been more than a couple of weeks and I spray a homemade Neem Oil flea repellant solution every time before I take my boys for a walk and it is keeping the fleas away.  I spray it on them once we step out of the house before we hit the road so the smell isn&#x27;t so much lingering inside the house as it did when I initially would spray it on them before stepping out.  This trick might help make it easier for others who are strongly offended by the smell.  Really happy about the product so far.</li>
            <li> It is a bit smelly, but worth it.  I got it for my dog.  She had a spot where her collar had rubbed the hair off.  We put antibiotic ointment on the spot and it made her raw!  We tried this and it is clearing up nicely.</li>
            <li> Neem oil is some stanky $!!+ but oh my does this stuff work. If you have tried everything for your skin conditions and no prevail then try this...yes it stinks maybe even make you want to gag if you get real close and smell. My tip is to use it in the shower put it on whatever and massage it for a couple of minutes then wash as usual. Only 4 stars cause it reeks but hey it works.</li>
            <li> Smells like burned peanuts, but not bad at all. Works great anywhere making the skin really soft. I use it on my heals, nails, knees, elbows...Lasts forever! Great product!</li>
            <li> The oil separated into layers. I also prefer to have oil stored in glass instead of plastic bottle. The thought of putting the questionable oil onto my face turns me off. Better safe than sorry, I returned the item.</li>
            <li> I read some people didn&#x27;t like the smell. I personally think it smells good. When I got mine it was too think to use. But that is an easy fix, all you have to do it warm a little bit in a glass jar placed in a pot of water and heat until it becomes liquid. The jar makes sure the oil doesn&#x27;t burn and gently melts the oil.</li>
            <li> I do appreciate the refund you will be hearing back from me again :) super eager to try this product</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! The smell doesn&#x27;t bother me like most people have said. It does smell like burnt peanuts in a way but it really reminds me of Vietnamese peanut butter sauce for dipping spring rolls ROFL! IDK why but it does remind me of that. I can see where people have said it smells like garlic but I don&#x27;t get a strong garlic smell. If you are not used to a plethora of smells then I can see why someone would really dislike this...I mean I wouldn&#x27;t lather myself up and go out in public or anything but I can deal with it at home. I&#x27;m sure this isn&#x27;t an option when you wanna get intimate either unless your spouse lathered themselves too haha. You can use this as a face moisturizer, there are many ways you can use this! I use it 1-2 times a week as a scalp rub and oil my whole head and hair and leave it for a day or overnight. I have used it as a face moisturizer even on my lashes. It is very moisturizing! DO NOT get it in your mouth or on your lips so becareful applying to your face! IT TASTE LIKE CRAP and lingers..the taste is indescribable but bitterly gross or whatever, maybe if you lick it you can comment and add to my review since everyone is different lmao. I love this product and will probably order more, I just hate the packaging! When the bottle arrived it was kind of oily where it might have gotten out of the bottle but it was solid when arrived. Not solid like coconut oil but something similar, it is not that solid but more of a creamier solid buttery type that is easier to dig away at than coconut. It melts faster too! I had to squeeze the bottle to get the contents out but after squeezing so much, you won&#x27;t be able to get the rest of the half out so I had my husband use a box cutter to cut from top to bottom and I opened it and put it all in a small container. If you decide to get this during the colder winter months then be prepared to cut it open if you use alot. If not then summer time will be no prob.</li>
            <li> Works great to keep mosquitoes away. A couple of drops on your arm, legs etc.</li>
            <li> Works very well.  Please note - if using on your plants you will need to also purchase a soap additive in order to mix with water and spray on your plants.  Product was delivered as promised and is a great value!!  Would recommend to all organic growers for home garden.  Safe and reliable.</li>
            <li> This is authentic neem oil. good product.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Makes me smell like old garlic tho.  Wear it to bed and shower before going anywhere if you decide to buy. Definately not for romantic nights at home.</li>
            <li> My first experience with neem oil, and it must be good because it smells REALLY strong, which is what neem oil is supposed to do. It solidifies at cool temperatures and becomes very uneven in texture and couldn&#x27;t be squeezed out of the bottle unless thoroughly warmed up and liquified. Learned it should be refrigerated to extend the shelf life, so I divided mine into small units to avoid heating up the whole thing time after time. Recommend the product and the seller.</li>
            <li> Good value.  I love neem oil</li>
            <li> Perfectly good Neem Oil.  It coagulates if left in the fridge but it melts quickly under warm water.  I use it to make HP soaps and it works great.</li>
            <li> The smell is something awful.  If something makes you vomit, you probably shouldn&#x27;t use it.  This stuff made me vomit a couple of times before I could wash it off!  YUCK!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s perfect. Nice quality, wonderful, smooth, moisturizing oil. Can be used for oral oil pulling too. I use it in my bees wax face &amp; body creams I make at home &amp; is really nice moisturizer on the hands.</li>
            <li> Awesome product. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> The oil feels raw and fresh! Great value! I bought it for my friend and I&#x27;ll recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> Peeeyoou it does have a off putting burned peanut smell, but it is heaven in a bottle for  skin and hair especially</li>
            <li> Item received as described.</li>
            <li> I had acne on my head and I tried a lot of different things. Now there no more thanks to this product&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li> Neem oil makes an immediate difference in the softness of my skin. It does solidify. So, I added a teaspoon of sea salt and a couple tablespoons of olive oil to make it squeezable out of the bottle. This is the best price I&#x27;ve seen on neem oil anywhere and the quality seems very comparable to more expensive brands. If you want to make your own salt scrub you can mix a jar of sea salt with this and your skin will feel baby soft. It&#x27;s also useful keeping bugs away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some reviewers complained about the smell. For sure, it is not an alluring scent, but I don&#x27;t find the scent particularly strong or offensive. A light application on your body should not be strong enough for anyone to smell but you.</li>
            <li> This is my second bottle of Neem Old that I have ordered from Coastal Scents. It works well keeping the mosquitoes away without using chemical pesticides.</li>
            <li> good and the smell not strong like other brand.</li>
            <li> Based on the dramatic reviews, I was expecting something unbearably foul. It only smells like Thai food (lol). I mix barely half an ounce of this in a big spray bottle with a pump-ful of dish-washing soap (or sometimes shampoo) and then fill it with warm water. Shake and spray. After spraying it around the house every 5 days, and a spritz on our cats, the fleas were gone in 2 weeks. (This stuff isn&#x27;t poison, it works by confusing the bugs from eating and mating. I found stupefied fleas just lying around. I laughed at their demise!)&lt;br /&gt;This is a nice size bottle so it&#x27;ll last me years. Only complaint is that the squeeze-hole lid is useless and gets oil all over the bottle. I just unscrew it now and pour straight.</li>
            <li> I read all the reviews, including the off-peanut butter smell.  I also read all the reviews saying how it helped with their acne. I weighed the benefits with the negative smell and decided to try it.  Well, the smell was definitely as described - but I was expecting it, so I endured the smell...I got used to it...but didn&#x27;t ever &amp;#34;like it.&amp;#34;  It&#x27;s a smell that one may be accustomed to, but never grow to like the smell, just used to it.  so, I used it every night and every morning after cleansing on my acne and acne scars/marks.  I would dab on with a q-tip...let it sit, then rub the rest in.  I used daily for about 3 weeks...never saw results to write home or anyone else about.  But, it was worth a shot.  If I didn&#x27;t...it could have been the miracle in a bottle I was looking for.  I&#x27;m now searching for ways to use this large bottle up...any suggestions?</li>
            <li> Please don&#x27;t use this product if you would like to have children! Before I use the product I actually took the time to read the label and found out that the oil is used in sterility and that it has been known to cause infertility in the lab rats it ( the product) has been tested on. I thought it would be a good product to use for my natural hair transition since it was a \\&quot;natural\\&quot; oil. I would not recommend this product to any one of childbearing age.</li>
            <li> Neem oil is GREAT for reducing the problems of TICKS, FLEAS, FLIES, GNATS and much more.  I just add an ounce to white vinegar in a pump sprayer, then had HOT water, pump it up and spray everything.  Sure it leaves a sort of garlic type scent but I&#x27;m okay with that to keep the bugs at bay.  I also add some to the dog shampoo when bathing the dogs, especially in the summer months. Neem oil is generally safe to use on otherwise healthy dogs, people and children for pest prevention.</li>
            <li> I brush my teeth with the oil to prevent mouth diseases and it works, just like they say in India. No more infections/root canals. No more bleeding from gingivitis and no more periodontal disease. It&#x27;s hard to believe I haven&#x27;t been to the dentist in almost a year. At 55, I was going to the dentist every 3 months for anther root canal, so this is a huge relief. I also take Neem Leaf Capsules. The Neem Tree is the United Nations &amp;#34;Tree of the 21st Century&amp;#34; because it kills viruses, bacteria, mold, fungus, parasites from the bloodstream and is wiping out malaria on a global scale!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this oil. It has done wonders to my hair and the change has been quick. If you have thin, brittle hair, apply it once a week, leave it on as long as you can stand the smell which, like many have said, is a combination of peanuts and garlic, and soon you will notice a considerable improvement. Mine has grown faster and stronger. It looks healthier. I think that, because it is less dense than coconut oil - which I have used many times in the past, the hair strand absorbs it better. My hair is fluffier, has more body, and more flexible.  The oil is easy to wash off (just shampoo twice).  It doesnâ€™t leave a residue, which has happened to me with coconut oil. I love it!!!!</li>
            <li> It did not get rid of the bugs in my house plants but I will be using it for soap making.</li>
            <li> Yes Neem oil has a garlicky or slight burnt peanut odor. Do some research before buying as it does smell. Neem oil has thousands of uses from hair care, antiseptic, lice killer and horse fly repellent spray. The list is endless.</li>
            <li> This is great stuff. I make a face cleanser with it. I will be ordering again.</li>
            <li> Neem oil is the best for skin conditions. Mixes well with Lavender or Lilac oil and other oils to dilute the often pungent smell.</li>
            <li> I needed this for spraying my garden plants. It&#x27;s a nice big bottle and should last a couple of years at least. Neem oil is one of those wonderful multi purpose products that i8s quickly becoming a must for every household.</li>
            <li> I love this oil. Online is the only place that I can find liquid neem oil. The Whole Foods next door to me does not even sell it in liquid form. I use this oil for my scalp psoriasis. But, it has so many other uses. If you are using it on your scalp, I recommend mixing it with a carrier oil ( I use coconut)  and a scented essential oil (jasmine, lavender, peppermint, etc.). Neem is very powerful ( a little goes a long way) and it has a strong odor.</li>
            <li> the oils smells like food, not bad food but you wouldnt want your hair or body to smell like it other than that its fine</li>
            <li> So far so good. Smell isn&#x27;t as bad as some complain. But it has eased my skin problems. Time will tell as far as helping grow out my eyebrows :)</li>
            <li> excellent product love it</li>
            <li> This is a great quality oil and I have been pleased with it.</li>
            <li> I put it in my shampoo and my hair is much softer!  Also use it in the dogs&#x27; shampoo to make their fur softer and as a flea deterrent.</li>
            <li> I buy Neem oil to use as pesticide. It is amazing. I put some on each plant in my garden. All insects, slugs, snails, larvae, and other pests are gone. It doesn&#x27;t kill them, but the smell is sooooo bad that it makes them leave my garden alone.</li>
            <li> Lots of oil, doesn&#x27;t smell that bad</li>
            <li> This stuff cures a lot of stuff</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Neem for years, both in the yard/garden, as well as for healing body products. Yes, it stinks, and it&#x27;s supposed to. This is good quality Neem at a decent price.</li>
            <li> GETS RID OF HEAD LICE COMPLETELY! My child had head lice and very long hair. I got a complete lice kit and it had the nit comb and worked well. But she has very long hair and I just could not keep up with taking out the nits. So I remembered neem oil being in a lice kit I bought that was advertised as being used by the military years ago. So I bought this pure neem oil. My daughter loved it, except the smell which is not perfume-like, lol, and she&#x27;s a teen. Anyway, the neem oil healed her scalp and competely got rid of the lice.She put some in her shampoo and she hasn&#x27;t had lice since. WOO HOO!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Not only is it great as a bug repellent but it smells really good! I&#x27;ve used it in the garden mixed with a bit of dawn soap. Even helped to repel some of the flies we&#x27;ve had so bad this year.</li>
            <li> Excellent natural product to deter pests from plants (outdoor &amp; indoor).  Just mix with water and spray on plants. Warning: since it is an oil, be aware of surrounding objects when spraying on plants.</li>
            <li> Absolutely amazing!! Neem oil gets rids of stubborn pimples fast. I have also used it for a flea repellent and it worked well for too. I will probably experiment with other uses..If I go back to oil cleansing I will definitely use this as one of the ingredients.</li>
            <li> OMG!!!! SHORTLY AFTER I BOUGHT THIS PRODUCT, I CAME DOWN WITH THE SHINGLES!!!! LET ME TELL YOU, THE SHINGLES BROKE OUT ON MY FACE!!! AND THE HOSPITAL STATED THAT IT WAS PROBABLY SPREAD AND GO INTO MY EYE.  WELL, I PUT SOME NEEM ON THE SHINGLES AND IT NOT ONLY KEPT THEM FROM SPREADING~ALL TRACES OF ME EVER HAVING SHINGLES WAS GONE IN LESS THAN A WEEK!!! IF YOU ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THE INGREDIENTS, YOU CAN GO TO THE MANUFACTURES&#x27; WEBSITE AND IT GIVES YOU A BREAKDOWN OF ALL THE INGREDIENTS!!! I EVEN PUT IT IN MY BATH WATER.  IT IS SMELLY, BUT IF YOU MIX IT WITH A LITTLE SHAMPOO OR BODY WASH, THE SCENT GOES AWAY. THIS PRODUCT IS A LIFE SAVER!!! ALSO GREAT FOR BED BUGS.</li>
            <li> SMELLS AWEFUL BUT it is good stuff. Works great to moisturize my problematic skin in the winter.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s arrival took awhile but I&#x27;m happy to have found it on my door today. The bottle was compressed a bit but that&#x27;s probably from the traveling. Excited to put it to use!</li>
