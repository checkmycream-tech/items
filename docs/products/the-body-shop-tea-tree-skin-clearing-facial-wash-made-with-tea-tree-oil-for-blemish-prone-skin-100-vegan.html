            <li>They are all AMAZING.</li>
            <li>AMAZING PRODUCT MUST BUY</li>
            <li>And let me tell you it is amazing,</li>
            <li>It feels amazing</li>
            <li>This product is amazing.</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing, my kids use it</li>
            <li>Now my skin is used to it and is literally amazing.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I liked this for the pros I listed, but when I read the ingredients list</li>
            <li>then let them heal and go away on their own.</li>
            <li>love this product, good price</li>
            <li>I kind of want to kiss whoever invented this.    </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s got kind of a pine tree smell to it</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t wear cover-up makeup at all, I find my skin is just radiant on its own</li>
            <li>The scent is nice, but doesn&#x27;t linger.</li>
            <li>Won&#x27;t repurchase myself but acne washes kind of depend on the person using them.</li>
            <li>Bought this item because I love Tea Tree and product stated it was good for blemish skin.</li>
            <li>As a 24-year-old guy, I never used a facewash of any kind (I would just scrub in the shampoo running out of my hair i guess).  </li>
            <li>and now im ordering this stuff on amazon because of how much I liked it.</li>
            <li>Has a cooling effect which is nice</li>
            <li>This gives a nice cooling feel and 1 bottle lasts forever.</li>
            <li>Well, when I bought this product about a month ago I liked</li>
            <li>But it feels nice and</li>
            <li>It gives a nice tingle on your face and lathers nicely.  </li>
            <li>Its nice for the feet and hands, too.</li>
            <li>It is so refreshing and feels so good.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m absolutely thrilled with this product.</li>
            <li>It foams up nicely and has a nice cooling effect because of the menthol.</li>
            <li>I used to use salicylic acid on my skin for years and never got the kind of results I get from tea tree oil products.  </li>
            <li>I saw so many good reviews for this</li>
            <li>Glad to see so many great reviews of this</li>
            <li>Great product... nice clean feeling after washing my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Does a great job of cleansing and leaves my skin feeling clean and refreshed.</li>
            <li>This cleanser has a great consistency for use with a Clarisonic, but I don&#x27;t feel that it does anything special.</li>
            <li>One of the best parts is that my skin does not feel dry at all after using it, which has been great.  </li>
            <li>Very suitable for one of my products, the effect is very good, hope can bring pleasantly surprised to me.</li>
            <li>The only benefit of this wash is the magnificent smell of tea tree and the tingly feeling that i loved but</li>
            <li>Awesome product face feels and looks very clear</li>
            <li>This has the nice refreshing tea-tree feel and fragrance, feels like its cleaning your face and freshening the mind as you wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Tea tree oil is nice and refreshing, but not drying.</li>
            <li>The price was great and the quantity is worth it</li>
            <li>The scent is strong !</li>
            <li>I did switch to a more sensitive formula(AcneFree products works well for me) but it still has benzoyl peroxide which seems to work the best to keep my acne at bay.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never felt more confident in my own skin.</li>
            <li>Also doesn&#x27;t give off that CLEAN feeling after a good wash.</li>
            <li>Great smell, lathers easily, gets your face clean.</li>
            <li>It has a very strong smell but love it for my face</li>
            <li>This stuff is great and I highly recommend it!!</li>
            <li>Generally the product is quite nice: it smells great, it feels good when I wash my skin with it, it has nice structure, and it actually significantly reduced the number of pimples on my face.</li>
            <li>If you find that the product is drying, just use a very light, water-based moisturizer and you&#x27;ll be receiving compliments on your complexion in no time.  </li>
            <li>And it is a very important but.</li>
            <li>the first time I put it on I fell in love!!</li>
            <li>I have tried so many face washes from drug store to higher end ones and this is still my favorite one!!</li>
            <li>Awesome facial wash.</li>
            <li>I also appreciate the fact that these products are not tested on innocent animals.</li>
            <li>the effect is ok</li>
            <li>I love how it lathers and cleans my face up.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>You shouldnt need to wash your face more than once a day &amp;</li>
            <li>I was using tea tree oil as a spot treatment with okay results, so I decided to try this wash.</li>
            <li>but I decided to try one more time.</li>
            <li>though if you&#x27;ve smelled tea tree oil before and don&#x27;t like the smell, you won&#x27;t like this) which makes using it so much better.</li>
            <li>I have since added some more Body Shop products to my regimen.</li>
            <li>Not quite sure how to put this,</li>
            <li>I would rather spend more money and get better product.</li>
            <li>and I absolutely Love it and</li>
            <li>and I still love it.  </li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>This face wash is like magic.</li>
            <li>Love this face</li>
            <li>You need to wash in the morning and before bed and make sure that you use the moisturizer after.  </li>
            <li>I am so glad I found it.</li>
            <li>I have never been so satisfied with a face/body wash for oily/acneic skin types.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I am using body shop tea tree product line for more than a year.</li>
            <li>I also love that the body shop does no animal testing.</li>
            <li>I have been very happy with the daily use of the Tea Tree Skin Clearing Wash and have notice a change in my face skin condition.</li>
            <li>I just wish The Body Shop had a better cap.</li>
            <li>A pump or inverted bottle might work better.</li>
            <li>This stuff is my favorite face wash.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>It was better before i used this product.</li>

            <li>cuz it&#x27;s famous</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t to pleased with it, and it irritated my skin</li>
            <li>I love most tea tree products this is not one I would buy again or recommend.</li>
            <li>Love, love, love this product.</li>
            <li>I used to love The Body Shop&#x27;s tea tree products, but this one is not working for me.</li>
            <li>As a face wash, it&#x27;s okay.  </li>
            <li>so make sure you moisturize after washing.</li>
            <li>Like the mint smell, definitely refreshing.</li>
            <li>used so many products for acne</li>
            <li>Its refreshing, I don&#x27;t have a ton of acne</li>
            <li>it never irritates or dries me out, but awesome for knocking back the rosacea and break-outs.</li>
            <li>I love everything about this but the smell.</li>
            <li>Absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li>She has requested more.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m sure it will work for anyone.</li>
            <li>Good wash for a fresh face.</li>
            <li>Love the smell.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad that I found it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for two weeks now and my skin has not gotten better</li>
            <li>I and my wife enjoyed in the morning and night.</li>
            <li>This has got to be kind of cheap knock off.</li>
            <li>make sure you know what tea tree smells like before you buy</li>
            <li>LOVE this cleanser.</li>
            <li>Smells great and leaves my face feeling super clean.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 25 with oily teenager skin, and I am telling you, this stuff works magic.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>There are more, look at any site which has a listing of comedegenic ingredients.&lt;br</li>
            <li>You need a moisturizer to go along with it, but I do not trust most &amp;#34;nongreasy&amp;#34; moisturizers at the pharmacy because most of them contain comedegenic ingredients and/or tighten the skin.  </li>
            <li>I have used this product for a year now and my skin has never been better.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve even used it to fight off a light attack of poison oak!</li>
            <li>When the package arrived it was all in one piece and looked ok.</li>
            <li>I love the feel of this wash on my face.</li>
            <li>My daughter has blackheads and acne that doesn&#x27;t respond to most OTC products.</li>
            <li>I use my face wash with a clarisonic mia as well so it gets the best cleaning possible.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>My family and I love The Body Shop Tea Tree products.</li>
            <li>Fantastic!</li>
            <li>For some reason the skin on my body is more accepting of it.</li>
            <li>I also love the smell.</li>
            <li>It is so refreshing</li>
            <li>I love the scent and gel texture.</li>
            <li>Free shipping at their website if you spend over $50 is a nice perk too.  </li>
            <li>And let me just say this product ok at first starts to show results that it&#x27;s working which made me feel good about purchasing the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Nice clean tea tree smell which isn&#x27;t too overpowering</li>
            <li>Love the soap, it does leave a strong Tea Tree scent after using, so make sure you like that smell.</li>
            <li>It leaves your face very clean feeling.</li>
            <li>Still, a great buy and probably works well for people with normal skin.</li>
            <li>Product seems pretty good.</li>
            <li>The smell is very calming and nice as well!</li>
            <li>It also has a clean, crisp scent that leaves my face feeling and smelling great.  </li>
            <li>It has a nice, mild tingle.</li>
            <li>It is a very specific type of smell, and if you haven&#x27;t used tea tree oil / products before, you will probably have to get used to it, but I actually really enjoy minty, herbal types of smells, so this was just perfect for me.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It gives a clean feeling!</li>
            <li>My girlfriend who has the most beautiful skin in the entire world (smooth af) has used this product for a while and recommended it to me because my skin is prone to regular acne breakouts, or so has been ever since I stopped using the anti acne cleanser that worked best for me.</li>
            <li>Very good facial cleanser</li>
            <li>I did investigate that if your looking for a very good facial wash to take acne away and</li>
            <li>great product, feels great, slightly tingly, makes my face feel fresh!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so much more comfortable with my skin</li>
            <li>which is what is most important to me.</li>
            <li>I like tea tree oil as its natural and its supposed to be great for acne prone skin.</li>
            <li>It hasn&#x27;t completely cleared my skin, but has done a great job in reducing the amount of breakouts.</li>
            <li>And most importantly, it works like a</li>
            <li>-- it&#x27;s great, but, wow...</li>
            <li>-- it&#x27;s great, but, wow...</li>
            <li>really appreciate that they supposedly do fair trade, help the environment, and against animal testing.</li>
            <li>Normally this is the best cleanser ever , when bought from the body shop , but this is not the real deal.</li>
            <li>It is a good product and really helpful.</li>
            <li>and it really appears to clean up my pours very nicely.  </li>
            <li>but this has a great effect right from first use.</li>
            <li>After finding out, I tried other products but found out that my skin works the best with this product.</li>
            <li>But it true does work wonders when you balance it with something else!</li>
            <li>every now and then as well as the tea tree oil toner, also by The Body Shop, to make sure that your skin is completely clean.  </li>
            <li>Love how clean and refreshed my skin feels after each wash.</li>
            <li>My skin is prone to breakouts but haven&#x27;t had any with this.&lt;br /&gt;Washed off easy.</li>
            <li>I tried so many of those popular brands and they didn&#x27;t really work well.</li>
            <li>the smell is awfully strong.</li>
            <li>I know Tea Tree Oil has a strong scent but the scent of this</li>
            <li>After using it, my face feels so smooth and clean!</li>
            <li>And it smells so good and natural!!</li>
            <li>That is pretty amazing, although I will not venture into saying that it&#x27;s cured my acne just yet.</li>
            <li>I just washed with it for the first time and I have to say it&#x27;s quite amazing.</li>
            <li>I was told its good for oily skin but not for normal skin...</li>
            <li>This stuff does an amazing job of keeping my skin clean and fresh.</li>
            <li>i love this item, special smell, comfortable feeling on my face and lots of foam.</li>
            <li>Smells fine.</li>
            <li>but it smells fine idk.</li>
            <li>LOVE LOVE this whole line!</li>
            <li>I love that the face wash and the rest of the line has done away with my breakouts and evened my skin tone out so quickly.</li>
            <li>Works quickly, pleasant armor and assist in maintaining a clear complexion.</li>
            <li>It also seems to make existing pimples on my face run their course more quickly and lightens my scars.  </li>
            <li>Bought this for the hubby who has huge issues with oily skin.</li>
            <li>I am a huge fan of tea tree oil</li>
            <li>I am a HUGE fan of the Body Shop&#x27;s Tea Tree Oil</li>
            <li>Both of my teenage daughters use this with great results.  </li>
            <li>This face wash will make your skin tingle as you use it, and it will feel free afterward.</li>
            <li>This is alright as an everday light wash, and does its job alright.</li>
            <li>I use this with the Olay facial brush and have great results.</li>
            <li>It does leave my skin breakout free</li>
            <li>This product is great when combined with a facial puff.</li>
            <li>My skin always feels fresh and not over-dried as opposed to most oil control products.</li>
            <li>It also smelled great and last you quite a while before you run out to the store and get another one.</li>
            <li>Excellent results without being too harsh.</li>
            <li>MAKEUP FREE</li>
            <li>I really enjoy the way this product smells.</li>
            <li>And honestly the price for all three products is extremely reasonable for how well it works</li>
            <li>It effectively removes oil from my face and really clears my pores.</li>
            <li>This is gentle and effective.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a fabulous product</li>
            <li>It makes my skin smooth and reduces the oil.</li>
            <li>Well after several weeks of using it I am happy to say her acne has improved quite a bit.</li>
            <li>So I gave this a try and all it does is make my face feel smooth and refreshed, but the acne hasn&#x27;t stopped breaking out.</li>
            <li>I use it on my face with fantastic results.</li>
            <li>Of course, there is the free shipping deal from Amazon if you spend over $25, so shipping costs are not a problem for me.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Obviously, it has not gotten rid of all my acne over night (nothing can really do that), but it feels wonderful on my skin</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>My doctor prescribed MetroGel which is a very effective topical treatment, but I have been experimenting with the rest of my facial routine, and this wash is a welcome addition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My face has actually gotten much better after using this!!</li>
            <li>I used my first bottle for 5 months!!</li>
            <li>it is very effective, so I use it at night only.</li>
            <li>Leaves my face feeling stimulated and ultra clean, as well as smooth.  </li>
            <li>I really like this face wash , smells pretty good</li>
            <li>But it was quick and easy to use it.  </li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this cleanser after reading all of the amazing reviews.</li>
            <li>Update (original review on 1/6/15, update today 3/1/15)  </li>
            <li>My skin looks a lot better after using this consistently.</li>
            <li>Even though this face wash isn&#x27;t exactly &amp;#34;made&amp;#34; for me, I love it anyway.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kind of an extensive regimen, but it works better than anything I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li>but it leaves it clean and for moisturizing I have a moisturizer</li>
            <li>After i wash my face it feels refreshed and clean.</li>
            <li>The face wash works just like a charm and leaves my face feeling refreshed and clean afterwards.</li>
            <li>I love anything with tea tree oil in it because tea tree is a natural anti-fungal, sure to cure whatever is driving your skin</li>
            <li>My face doesn&#x27;t even feel clean after using it.</li>
            <li>And, my skin feels clean longer, with no oil.</li>
            <li>and you can feel the clean after using the wash.</li>
            <li>My face feels clean without drying it out.</li>
            <li>Leaves my face clean and feeling all tingly.</li>
            <li>It takes off all my makeup and oil and makes my skin feel and look so clean and clearer.</li>
            <li>It leaves my face clean and moisturized and it has drastically reduced my acne outbreaks.</li>
            <li>and I can feel how clean my face is father washing it.</li>
            <li>Has a pleasant aroma and seems like it will last a while.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t do much for my skin... love the smell.</li>
            <li>Effective in helping to keep my skin clear</li>
            <li>a good smell doesn&#x27;t take away these dang white heads.</li>
            <li>This is the only facewash I have used and it gets the job done as good as anything else.</li>
            <li>I wash my face with a spritz bottle full of distilled water.</li>
            <li>Makes me feel like it isn&#x27;t getting into my pores which I know isn&#x27;t true</li>
            <li>This brand is true tea-tree.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t get a full product.</li>
            <li>Overall good product...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cool~</li>
            <li>The tea tree oil really helps with acne and oiliness, and it smells and feels so refreshing.</li>
            <li>It also comes in a kit with a full size tea tree oil and mini sizes of their tea tree lotion &amp; toner for $25.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I have to say that I really have grown to love it.  </li>
            <li>and I have to say that I really have grown to love it.  </li>
            <li>used this for quite some time, and firstly the smell was extremely strong and not to pleasing.</li>
            <li>Give your face a fresh and clean feel.  </li>
            <li>My face always feels fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>, I thought it was just because of the hormones from being pregnant</li>
            <li>I went with this because of the extraordinary body shop tea tree astringent.</li>
            <li>, Resist C15 Super Booster (a vitimin C and E lotion) and the Eminence Blueberry Soy Night Recovery Cream.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m definitely loyal to this face wash now.</li>
            <li>It has made a tremendous difference for her.</li>
            <li>I love the smell to this product, however, if your skin dries up very easily, this product will dry you up.</li>
            <li>HIGHLY recommended if you&#x27;ve tried everything else and aren&#x27;t sure where else to turn.</li>
            <li>Thank you for making a whole set of products with such a natural, wonderful oil!    </li>
            <li>The toner is very refreshing and picks up whatever is left from the wash.</li>
            <li>I bought this product even though i have normal skin without many blemishes.  </li>
            <li>I also bought the scrub (which I love), the mask (which I love), and the cooling creme cleanser (which is a little oily feeling but it makes your skin feel very clean and refreshed).</li>
            <li>but it definitely gives a nice and clean feel after use.</li>
            <li>Your face feels clean and not tight like so many cleansers make the skin feel.</li>
            <li>I use so many new things at once</li>
            <li>I have found a new favorite.</li>
            <li>tree extracts have strong anti-bacterial properties, so if you suffer from breakouts or acne, this should really make a difference for your skin.</li>
            <li>I would have returned it, but then I discovered its other amazing use:  as a makeup brush cleaner!  </li>
            <li>After my third week of using all three Tea Tree Oil products, my face has never looked better!</li>
            <li>I would most likely repurchase this at full price!</li>
            <li>But 3 stars because it DOES work on certain people and makes one&#x27;s skin feel smooth</li>
            <li>I originally started using it because I&#x27;m pregnant and this facial wash is safe for your skin to use while pregnant as it doesn&#x27;t have the sacyllic acid or benzoyl peroxide in it, which can be toxic to your baby as its absorbed by your skin and into your blood stream.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to get emotional while writing this review because that&#x27;s how amazing this product is.</li>
            <li>At first, I was freaking out because for the first time in years I was getting huge pimples on my face that were taking forever to go away.</li>
            <li>Worth the money</li>
            <li>Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using products with benzoyl peroxide but wanted to try something more natural.</li>
            <li>I like the fresh cooling feeling</li>
            <li>It is so worth the price.</li>
            <li>Feels really fresh every time I use it.</li>
            <li>My 13  year old uses this regularly and it has GREATLY cleared up her skin.</li>
            <li>The light bulb went off, and I checked the ingredients and sure enough, SLS was in it.</li>
            <li>you are looking for fresh sensation so trust me and go ahead</li>
            <li>This facial wash smelled great and help clear up my blemishes.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s a more natural wash.</li>
            <li>so restoring my overall youthfullness was nice).</li>
            <li>Liked the way my face felt when I used this product, actually used it on the body too.  </li>
            <li>The smell is fresh.</li>
            <li>its worth a try.</li>
            <li>I came across The Body Shop&#x27;s (TBS) tea tree cleanser a few weeks ago and found I have really liked using it for many reasons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Normally, foaming and chemical-laden cleanser make my skin feel dry when I leave it on, but my skin felt great.</li>
            <li>I even have a cyst on my chin that it&#x27;s reducing very quickly, and I normally have to get shots of cortizone to make them go away.</li>
            <li>The reason we give it 4 stars instead of 5 is because it&#x27;s very strong and the tingling sensation is almost too much for her sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It gets the job done, right, every time.</li>
            <li>However, if you are wishing to use it right away the shipping does take a bit</li>
            <li>your face shine so this is the right product&lt;</li>
            <li>so this is the right product&lt;</li>
            <li>As I&#x27;m typing this right now acne is all across my forehead .</li>
            <li>When he uses this with the lotion, it clears his skin right up.</li>
            <li>It was too runny and didn&#x27;t smell right.</li>
            <li>It has a very strong smell, but served the purpose for my teenage step-daughter&#x27;s acne issues.  </li>
            <li>I dont have very strong facial acne</li>
            <li>I am 29 and have had some kind of acne for as long as I can remember.</li>
            <li>First of all, I shall stablish the fact that i have very greasy skin,&lt;br /&gt;Point being made, I really like this product, my skin feels really nice and soft, and it takes away the grease for quite a while during the day.</li>
            <li>I also add a little pure tea tree oil to the bottle as i really love tea tree oil and all its benefits!!</li>
            <li>My skin is so smooth and blemish free that I no longer wear foundation on a daily basis.  </li>
            <li>My skin is smooth and blemish free just by using this product for a solid week!  </li>
            <li>I love the fresh, energizing smell of this facial wash!</li>
            <li>But for the money I spent on it, I wish it worked better!</li>
            <li>So i am very very choosy, demanding and cautious about selecting any product for my skin.</li>
            <li>like it very much.</li>
            <li>I have very, very oily skin.</li>
            <li>it is a great cleanser that gives a deep down clean.</li>
            <li>Worked pretty well at first.</li>
            <li>I really love this facial wash!!</li>
            <li>At first I would wash my face with this two to three times a day</li>
            <li>Using more than once a day will result in your skin producing extra oils, which in turn makes you break out.</li>
            <li>When I first started using this product, I was HOOKED.</li>
            <li>It seems counterintuitive to use moisturizer on an oily face, but that&#x27;s exactly what you have to do</li>
            <li>Some of the best results you can imagine without the long term consequences of harsh acid-based products.</li>
            <li>After using it consistently for 6 weeks I switched back to using a La Roche Posay cleanser, and my skin immediately started to look and feel better.</li>
            <li>After using this only one time at night (along with the tea tree toner and tea tree lotion) I noticed that in the morning my skin looked significantly better.</li>
            <li>He has been using all three products for about two weeks &amp; we are definitely seeing a change in his acne for the better.</li>
            <li>I had tried so many different products to get rid of the acne</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m on my third bottle and have been acne free since!</li>
            <li>I tried switching to other brands with same ingredients but they dint give as good results as Body shop  !&lt;</li>
            <li>I have only used this product two or three times now, but I really love it.  </li>
            <li>and I have tried soo many different products and home remedies for my skin that didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>Has a very minty smell, but I can feel it cleansing my skin!</li>
            <li>pretty badly.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend the Tea Tree Oil wash from the Body Shop!!</li>
            <li>the first time I used it, it smelled kinda funky.. but feels like a tingly sensation on your face so to me</li>
            <li>And is soooo much cheaper than others on the market!</li>
            <li>and I have been using this whole line since!</li>
            <li>Thanks Body Shop!</li>
            <li>It smells funny.</li>
            <li>I really like this product!</li>
            <li>, I read  on some sites that at first the face &#x27;&amp;#34;purges&amp;#34;&amp;#34; but it has been 11 days</li>
            <li>but I really like this product the most because first its my favorite color green.</li>
            <li>My first time trying this product</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s pretty even keeled</li>
            <li>So soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>It is silky smooth coming off and my skin is soft as well.</li>
            <li>FAST!</li>
            <li>TBS also runs sales and emails me coupons, so I would be able to purchase at a reduced price in the future (though I did purchase this using a 20% off coupon code).  </li>
            <li>Anything tea tree oil is good but some products can be harsh.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a lot more smooth and less oily than before.</li>
            <li>This does leave my face very clean but also turns my skin red for about an hour after washing with this.</li>
            <li>, although the product decreases my acne significantly, it doesn&#x27;t completely PREVENT is from appearing on my skin.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin so soft and it feels so fresh!</li>
            <li>My daughter has very sensitive skin, and other products have not been good for her.</li>
            <li>Proactiv dries her skin, Clean and Clear does not keep the pimples away, and Nuetragena leaves her oily.</li>
            <li>The Body Shop keeps her skin clear and clean, without over-drying.  </li>
            <li>After wash the skin feels soft n so clean.</li>
            <li>Then it just started really drying out my extremely oily skin and caused me to break out even more!</li>
            <li>even so I would recommend using a really good facial moisturizer to keep your skin from producing those extra oils.</li>
            <li>The Body Shop Tea Tree Oil face wash is something I would confidently recommend to anyone looking for something gentle that will totally remove acne and breakouts.</li>
            <li>and I have nothing but positive things to say.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 34 and get breakouts (thanks, stress), but this product is so consistent for me.</li>
            <li>clean and fresh feeling after facial wash with this.</li>
            <li>I recommend trying something less drying or use some kind of moisturizer or lotion.</li>
            <li>(it doesn&#x27;t have to be exact, just close), rinse brushes in mixture, and it&#x27;ll transform your old makeup brushes into their original soft, brand-new condition.  </li>
            <li>It works really well for him and the bottle lasts forever.</li>
            <li>I bought the whole line.</li>
            <li>Please save your money and buy something else because i have very oily skin</li>
            <li>and I do not break out as much.</li>
            <li>But it doesn&#x27;t help as much as I had anticipated.</li>
            <li>This line has helped so much.  </li>
            <li>I have had acne my whole life and in my 30s now.</li>
            <li>I really wanted this to work</li>
            <li>I think people tend to use too much face wash.</li>
            <li>I really like this product a lot.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this product, but no luck!</li>
            <li>of tea tree cleansers is very watery</li>
            <li>What really inspired me to write was the minty, menthol-like feeling I had while washing my face.</li>
            <li>Really like this face wash.</li>
            <li>but I will continue using it and hope it really works.</li>
            <li>It has really helped me with my skin issues.</li>
            <li>My skin type is very oily(around the nose and under my eyes)</li>
            <li>Something about it is very therapeutic.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the real deal, I&#x27;ve been using this product for years but moved to an area where there&#x27;s not a Body Shop in convenient distance.</li>
            <li>this is also another way I know it&#x27;s the real thing.</li>
            <li>I really like the scent</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t really see any noticeable differences on my face after using this product for quite some time.</li>
            <li>This caused me to break out and have really horrendous acne problems that I hadn&#x27;t had since I was a teenager.</li>
            <li>i really like this wash.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t really feel my face as refreshed as I would like it.  </li>
            <li>Really cleans my skin well and helps with acne</li>
            <li>I use this with my Clairsonic Mia 2, I have very oily acne prone skin</li>
            <li>and it really helps there skin..</li>
            <li>I like washing my face with this so much.</li>
            <li>Dr Pham my eye doctor recommended I really like the product it is working very well for me.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>We had a very humid Summer, so my skin was very oily.  </li>
            <li>We had a very humid Summer, so my skin was very oily.  </li>
            <li>I failed to mention above that I have sensitive, combination, acne-prone skin, so it&#x27;s rather a nightmare to find a good cleanser at a good price.  </li>
            <li>I failed to mention above that I have sensitive, combination, acne-prone skin, so it&#x27;s rather a nightmare to find a good cleanser at a good price.  </li>
            <li>usually use neutrogena deep clean, but I feel like this stuff might clean and fight oily skin a bit better.  </li>
            <li>I recommend completely!!!</li>
            <li>Although i used this product and found it to be better than the other acne facial cleansers i have used i found the Neutrogena Rapid Clear Foaming Scrub to be much better at clearing my skin.</li>
            <li>I woke up yesterday morning and was in such a fantastic mood because my skin looked BEAUTIFUL (or at least relatively so).</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin soft and feeling clean and clear.</li>
            <li>The scent is non-existent, whereas with the original, the tea tree oil is obviously present.</li>
            <li>I just had a baby a couple months ago and due to lovely hormones my face was breaking out.</li>
            <li>My skin has improved significantly since I started using this daily.</li>
            <li>She has tried other products, this one is her favorite.</li>
            <li>I think for my face, the most beneficial OTC treatment has always been benzoyl peroxide, although that is also extremely drying.  </li>
            <li>I really wish I could find some batches of the older face wash to buy in bulk...</li>
            <li>I use this as the last thing to clean my face, neck, chest, shoulders, and anywhere else</li>
            <li>It truly leaves my face squeaky clean when used with my spinning facial brush.</li>
            <li>I usually follow up my regimen with the tea tree toner with takes more excess oil off and I am left with a fresh clean face.</li>
            <li>It does not dry out my skin, and leaves it soft and smooth feeling.  </li>
            <li>I am 26 and got my first break out of adult acne.</li>
            <li>but if you have sensitive skin I would try something else first.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re not sure about it, there&#x27;s a mini version of it on TBS&#x27;s website for $4, which makes for a nice travel size as well.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a fantastic cleanser for the price, and it lasts a long time!</li>
            <li>I have accidentally let run down my eyes while using my clairsonic in the shower, other than that I love this product!!</li>
            <li>I use konjac facial sponge in the morning and an electronic facial brush in the evening, and I always reach for the tea tree facial wash from The Body Shop to make sure my skin gets some extra boost of healthy ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So I need to use only mild, non-perfumed, alcohol-free products.</li>
            <li>For instance, I really like Dermaquest&#x27;s enzyme cleanser ($30) and Cor&#x27;s silver soap ($40), but they are rather expensive -- great products though.  </li>
            <li>(it&#x27;s really hard looking for jobs and being confident on interviews right out of college when your skin is blotchy and blemished)</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended for acne or oily skin.</li>
            <li>, I had high hopes for this product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product to others.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend if you are a fan of tea tree products.</li>
            <li>Once I used just a little for a week then built up, it was much better.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not popping acne, I&#x27;m more like little blemishes here and there, but it hasn&#x27;t cleared me of those yet...</li>
            <li>I like the body wash a little better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m highly dissapointed in allll their products because I purchased the whole set and were a complete let</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, the tea tree facial wash is worth trying if you have combination skin, as I have found it hasn&#x27;t dried me out, yet seems to leave my skin feeling clean and fresh.  </li>
            <li>It helps clear my pimples and prevent it -works fast too.</li>
            <li>I just wanted something to clear my blackheads, I dont really have acne prone skin unless I forget to wash my face.</li>
            <li>This tea tree skin cleanser really helps to keep my face clear of blemishes.  </li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really seem to clear up any blemishes.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s too expensive because it&#x27;s a pretty good sized bottle.</li>
            <li>But after a few months of this stuff, my skin has never looked better.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love using just a few drops of this all over my face in my morning shower.</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;ve had it nearly 3 years), but I have been really liking their new acne head as of late.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is more clear and brighter in appearance and the blemishes are less.</li>
            <li>This wash keeps my face free and clear of blemishes, and it doesn&#x27;t leave my face dry at all.  </li>
            <li>Dries my skin out a little more than I&#x27;d like, and doesn&#x27;t clean it as well as other face washes I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li>and I wasn&#x27;t really a huge fan of this product, think I&#x27;ll stick to other brands.</li>
            <li>Other than that, I enjoy the line.</li>
            <li>But if you have normal, dry, sensitive or mixed skin type you better use something else.</li>
            <li>I combined the tea tree face wash with my new clairsonic and within weeks the zits diminished drastically.</li>
            <li>I have been using the body shop tea tree system (face wash, toner, moisturizer) and unless you use some other kind of moisturizer (I use a vitamin e coconut oil) it will dry out your skin.</li>
            <li>, I am using an anti biotic now to clear my face and will go back to just using my old mild face wash and BP .</li>
            <li>for me :) little did i know, this coupon experience was going to change my face for ever!</li>
            <li>This is a favorite for both my wife and I. Many other facial washes (especially ones that are castile soap based) seem to leave the face very dry and sometimes sting a bit when using.</li>
            <li>I have an oily and very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyway, i have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin, and this is what I wanted.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s completely  clear!</li>
            <li>They weren&#x27;t exactly pimples, red, or itchy.</li>
            <li>This is the only product that has ever left me feeling confident enough to go</li>
            <li>The product itself, kind of irritated my skin in a way that it gave it that burning sensation, but definitely not in a good way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I usually order 3 at a time and people buy me this product as part of my gifts :)  </li>
            <li>This skin wash has continued to help me fight adult acne!  </li>
            <li>The viscosity is off too: the original is much thicker than this green water I received.</li>
            <li>After a while of using it, I started getting extremely sensitive around my nose area, it would get SUPER itchy and flaky and uncomfortable and it&#x27;d be bright red, though this problem was fixed with applying some moisturizer after use.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t reduce redness but it leaves face fresh and un oily or dry.</li>
            <li>It´s a little bit strong for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>and it really is the same original facial wash from the physical Body Shop.</li>
            <li>Hands down, my favorite facial wash ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Ok so I was a little skeptical buying this product at first because literally every other product I have tried had not been successful.</li>
            <li>Love this product, will definitely be looking for other tea tree products of this line!</li>
            <li>Stubborn and deep blackheads and also large, clogged pores.</li>
            <li>I guess this product only works well for certain skin type people.</li>
            <li>Now that the winter air is here, it&#x27;s a little drying but a light moisturizer is all you need.</li>
            <li>Still get the occasional pimple, but they&#x27;re nowhere near as large or long-lasting as before.</li>
            <li>Also, if you are sensitive to strong scents, maybe steer clear of this because it has a very odd smell.</li>
            <li>My non-oily face turbed into a super oily one, probably due to hormones.</li>
            <li>I have only been using it for a little over a week, and my complexion is already more clear.</li>
            <li>This does help clear the breakouts and keep them at bay.</li>
            <li>I do believe the tea tree oil is helping my skin condition to clear.</li>
            <li>So, if you are like me and are looking for a product to clear blackheads then l would not recommend this.</li>
            <li>Not wonderful for makeup but defiantly great to use after my regular wash</li>
            <li>Has helped clear my face in a month&#x27;s use.</li>
            <li>It helps to clear and control ay outbreaks I may experience.</li>
            <li>This helped clear up a lot of the redness and pimple looking places that the ingrown hairs had been and helped clear them up.</li>
            <li>My skin is basically clear from pimples now</li>
            <li>My skin stays clear and balanced.</li>
            <li>After 3 months of using three products routinely her skin is 80% clear.</li>
            <li>If you are use to having acne breakouts, especially around your cycle, this face wash really helps to limit the break outs.  </li>
            <li>Pros: the face wash has a cooling effect on the skin, it is light enough for everyday use and doesn&#x27;t seem to strip my skin of too much oil&lt;</li>
            <li>also this face wash is not organic or 100 percent natural...</li>
            <li>Curing a long term outbreak requires repeated and consistent use.  </li>
            <li>Besides no staph I do not have any adult acne breakouts or problems.  </li>
            <li>My skin is so soft and tingly when I use it.</li>
            <li>As far as the product itsself</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m ready to buy the second bottle.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I worry about longterm use of BP and will keep searching for natural alternatives.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if this is an all natural organic product, but it appears to work quite well.</li>
            <li>I stopped using soaps and shampoos with it, but because I thought this was a natural product I still used it.</li>
            <li>Afterwards, I couldn&#x27;t believe how soft my skin felt.</li>
            <li>Works just as described, leaving your face feeling smooth and not oily without being dried out.</li>
            <li>These ingredients are known as the products that work directly with your acne.</li>
            <li>far as the effectiveness, I cant say.</li>
            <li>I have adult acne and rosacea and it&#x27;s not helping either of them -</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin feeling soft and plump.</li>
            <li>And, over the years I have developed something inside of my body that arrived to my scalp and face.  </li>
            <li>(I feel so busy).  </li>
            <li>but it cleans my face, I&#x27;ve used it for a week now and my face feels soft.</li>
            <li>Gentle enough</li>
            <li>It has not dried my skin out...yet.</li>
            <li>A really gentle cleanser that you can use daily.  </li>
            <li>I have also used with my facial scrubber and it is still gentle on the face.  </li>
            <li>The case is that, though my skin is very-very oily, it is also very-very sensitive.</li>
            <li>Before my skin changed, I was completely reliant on this line from The Body Shop.</li>
            <li>So as far as blemishes and acne goes, this product DID NOT WORK FOR ME.</li>
            <li>My skin feels so refreshed and soft after I&#x27;m done.  </li>
            <li>It makes my hands soft too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy</li>
            <li>My face is like baby butt soft</li>
            <li>/&gt;First off, I have sensitive, combination and acne prone skin.</li>
            <li>My face, at first, couldn&#x27;t take how strong the tea tree was and the acne got worse.  </li>
            <li>It just ok types, nothing different than other facial soap.</li>
            <li>: The first week I used it, my skin was REALLY DRY.  </li>
            <li>But, only for young skin, this did nothing to please my older skin.  </li>
            <li>I began using this right after I developed a skin allergy due to SLS.</li>
            <li>I have seen a tremendous change on my skin ever since I started using it: it is less oily</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m lucky enough that my acne is not as severe as it was when I was younger, but it is still moderate at all times.</li>
            <li>My skin is not less oily, but that&#x27;s a hormone thing, I think.</li>
            <li>It actually seemed like it was helping reduce the amount of acne on my face the first week but by the third week....</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this for almost two months now and have not noticed any improvement to my skin, no less acne or redness.</li>
            <li>There is a slight &amp;#34;tea tree&amp;#34; scent from it, which doesn&#x27;t bother me and seems to go away quickly.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it was really old or if it was watered down or not even the right stuff at all .</li>
            <li>when I use this, I usually let sit on my face for a bit just to enjoy the smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t really have acne, nor did I ever suffered from it, but I do get occasional break-outs and plenty of red spots, so I was looking for something to help clear up my skin and improve its health.</li>
            <li>, normally I look 18 when I&#x27;m actually 30</li>
            <li>After using this product for a few day it has began to Not bad at all for money.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if its worth the double the neutrogena price, but I&#x27;ll enjoy this bottle and reevaluate when it&#x27;s empty</li>
            <li>As somebody who suffers from chronic acne, I&#x27;m always in the lookout for a great facial wash.</li>
            <li>Doesnt dry my skin out too much, Controls oil and shine, doesn&#x27;t induce acne</li>
            <li>I love the tingly, cold, fresh sensations it gives.</li>
            <li>I had a facial recently and my facialist told me I should try tea tree oil products because they are anti-fungal and really help oil the acne causing bacteria.</li>
            <li>This smells pretty good, has a bit of a camphor smell (not exactly but difficult to pinpoint the actual smell).</li>
            <li>Needless to say, at 25 i have tried so many products and systems, toners, you name it!</li>
            <li>Now don&#x27;t expect a miracle, if your hormones are crazy, your young, pregnant or its that time of the month for the ladies, whatever reason, you will have light break outs from time to time.</li>
            <li>The smell is amazing and usually wakes me up a little bit.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use this and the foaming tea tree facial cleanser every day, and my face is 99% clear 99% of the time.</li>
            <li>I use the body shop tea tree line daily for years; it has kept my face amazingly clear and hydrated.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;re going to add the face mask next and see if we can get her skin totally clear.</li>
            <li>I just had to start using an entirely different brand completely.</li>
            <li>I had to go back to my old products.</li>
            <li>I recently bought this product directly from the body shop in lenox mall.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t work for my acne, but I may just have stubborn adult acne that requires medical help.</li>
            <li>I use this facial wash every morning as I have adult acne.  </li>
            <li>Second it has a natural anti bacterial agent in tea tree oil.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s also the fact that every single one of these products is extremely drying, which will only irritate your face more if you have naturally dry skin.  </li>
            <li>While washing, I actually left it on for half a minute to see how well it absorbed.</li>
            <li>If you have normal skin, you may get dry skin...</li>
            <li>Everyone is different one of my friends used this product for 1 1/2 month- 3 months and face is very clear from black pore and acne, i like FAST result which you have to be patient and keep using it to see results...</li>
            <li>I thought other women would really benefit.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a good acne cleanser, I would suggest you keep looking because unfortunately this one is NOT it!</li>
            <li>Invigorating scent, and really strips down to the bare skin.</li>
            <li>I have fairly clear, slightly oily skin normally.</li>
            <li>my skin is still not clear clear</li>
            <li>I have noticed that throughout the months I&#x27;ve been using this (nearly a year), I have had nearly NO breakouts or problem pimples.</li>
            <li>I am not sure if there are mint in it, because my skin felt really fresh after using</li>
            <li>I decided to try this out and after the first night&#x27;s use i could see that my face was way less oily!</li>
            <li>The body shop tea tree skin clearing facial wash has not a single trace of benzoyl peroxide or salicylic acid.</li>
            <li>and I can imagine if you have a sensitive skin, this product may dry your skin out.</li>
            <li>I bought this to help my sensitive, combination (closer to dry), acne-prone skin.  </li>
            <li>It leaves your face clean enough to literally shine, and for me it made me look less weathered, (I&#x27;ve been having some down days</li>
            <li>After a few months of using these product, I&#x27;m starting to notice the positive benefits that it has had on my acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Probably too drying for sensitive or dry skin, but that&#x27;s not the purpose of this stuff!</li>
            <li>The further down the list of ingredients, the lower concentration of that particular ingredient.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> AMAZING PRODUCT MUST BUY</li>
            <li> And let me tell you it is amazing,</li>
            <li> It feels amazing</li>
            <li> This product is amazing.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing, my kids use it</li>
            <li> Now my skin is used to it and is literally amazing.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I liked this for the pros I listed, but when I read the ingredients list</li>
            <li> then let them heal and go away on their own.</li>
            <li> love this product, good price</li>
            <li> I kind of want to kiss whoever invented this.    </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s got kind of a pine tree smell to it</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s own</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wear cover-up makeup at all, I find my skin is just radiant on its own</li>
            <li> The scent is nice, but doesn&#x27;t linger.</li>
            <li> Won&#x27;t repurchase myself but acne washes kind of depend on the person using them.</li>
            <li> Bought this item because I love Tea Tree and product stated it was good for blemish skin.</li>
            <li> As a 24-year-old guy, I never used a facewash of any kind (I would just scrub in the shampoo running out of my hair i guess).  </li>
            <li> and now im ordering this stuff on amazon because of how much I liked it.</li>
            <li> Has a cooling effect which is nice</li>
            <li> This gives a nice cooling feel and 1 bottle lasts forever.</li>
            <li> Well, when I bought this product about a month ago I liked</li>
            <li> But it feels nice and</li>
            <li> It gives a nice tingle on your face and lathers nicely.  </li>
            <li> Its nice for the feet and hands, too.</li>
            <li> It is so refreshing and feels so good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m absolutely thrilled with this product.</li>
            <li> It foams up nicely and has a nice cooling effect because of the menthol.</li>
            <li> I used to use salicylic acid on my skin for years and never got the kind of results I get from tea tree oil products.  </li>
            <li> I saw so many good reviews for this</li>
            <li> Glad to see so many great reviews of this</li>
            <li> Great product... nice clean feeling after washing my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Does a great job of cleansing and leaves my skin feeling clean and refreshed.</li>
            <li> This cleanser has a great consistency for use with a Clarisonic, but I don&#x27;t feel that it does anything special.</li>
            <li> One of the best parts is that my skin does not feel dry at all after using it, which has been great.  </li>
            <li> Very suitable for one of my products, the effect is very good, hope can bring pleasantly surprised to me.</li>
            <li> The only benefit of this wash is the magnificent smell of tea tree and the tingly feeling that i loved but</li>
            <li> Awesome product face feels and looks very clear</li>
            <li> This has the nice refreshing tea-tree feel and fragrance, feels like its cleaning your face and freshening the mind as you wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Tea tree oil is nice and refreshing, but not drying.</li>
            <li> The price was great and the quantity is worth it</li>
            <li> The scent is strong !</li>
            <li> I did switch to a more sensitive formula(AcneFree products works well for me) but it still has benzoyl peroxide which seems to work the best to keep my acne at bay.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never felt more confident in my own skin.</li>
            <li> Also doesn&#x27;t give off that CLEAN feeling after a good wash.</li>
            <li> Great smell, lathers easily, gets your face clean.</li>
            <li> It has a very strong smell but love it for my face</li>
            <li> This stuff is great and I highly recommend it!!</li>
            <li> Generally the product is quite nice: it smells great, it feels good when I wash my skin with it, it has nice structure, and it actually significantly reduced the number of pimples on my face.</li>
            <li> If you find that the product is drying, just use a very light, water-based moisturizer and you&#x27;ll be receiving compliments on your complexion in no time.  </li>
            <li> And it is a very important but.</li>
            <li> the first time I put it on I fell in love!!</li>
            <li> I have tried so many face washes from drug store to higher end ones and this is still my favorite one!!</li>
            <li> Awesome facial wash.</li>
            <li> I also appreciate the fact that these products are not tested on innocent animals.</li>
            <li> the effect is ok</li>
            <li> I love how it lathers and cleans my face up.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> You shouldnt need to wash your face more than once a day &amp;</li>
            <li> I was using tea tree oil as a spot treatment with okay results, so I decided to try this wash.</li>
            <li> but I decided to try one more time.</li>
            <li> though if you&#x27;ve smelled tea tree oil before and don&#x27;t like the smell, you won&#x27;t like this) which makes using it so much better.</li>
            <li> I have since added some more Body Shop products to my regimen.</li>
            <li> Not quite sure how to put this,</li>
            <li> I would rather spend more money and get better product.</li>
            <li> and I absolutely Love it and</li>
            <li> and I still love it.  </li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> This face wash is like magic.</li>
            <li> Love this face</li>
            <li> You need to wash in the morning and before bed and make sure that you use the moisturizer after.  </li>
            <li> I am so glad I found it.</li>
            <li> I have never been so satisfied with a face/body wash for oily/acneic skin types.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> I am using body shop tea tree product line for more than a year.</li>
            <li> I also love that the body shop does no animal testing.</li>
            <li> I have been very happy with the daily use of the Tea Tree Skin Clearing Wash and have notice a change in my face skin condition.</li>
            <li> I just wish The Body Shop had a better cap.</li>
            <li> A pump or inverted bottle might work better.</li>
            <li> This stuff is my favorite face wash.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> It was better before i used this product.</li>
            <li> but my face produced way more acne in places</li>
            <li> /&gt;Recommended to anyone suffering from acne or simply looking for a great face wash!</li>
            <li> I love this facewash.</li>
            <li> okay.</li>
            <li> cuz it&#x27;s famous</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t to pleased with it, and it irritated my skin</li>
            <li> I love most tea tree products this is not one I would buy again or recommend.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this product.</li>
            <li> I used to love The Body Shop&#x27;s tea tree products, but this one is not working for me.</li>
            <li> As a face wash, it&#x27;s okay.  </li>
            <li> so make sure you moisturize after washing.</li>
            <li> Like the mint smell, definitely refreshing.</li>
            <li> used so many products for acne</li>
            <li> Its refreshing, I don&#x27;t have a ton of acne</li>
            <li> it never irritates or dries me out, but awesome for knocking back the rosacea and break-outs.</li>
            <li> I love everything about this but the smell.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li> She has requested more.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m sure it will work for anyone.</li>
            <li> Good wash for a fresh face.</li>
            <li> Love the smell.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad that I found it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for two weeks now and my skin has not gotten better</li>
            <li> I and my wife enjoyed in the morning and night.</li>
            <li> This has got to be kind of cheap knock off.</li>
            <li> make sure you know what tea tree smells like before you buy</li>
            <li> LOVE this cleanser.</li>
            <li> Smells great and leaves my face feeling super clean.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 25 with oily teenager skin, and I am telling you, this stuff works magic.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> There are more, look at any site which has a listing of comedegenic ingredients.&lt;br</li>
            <li> You need a moisturizer to go along with it, but I do not trust most &amp;#34;nongreasy&amp;#34; moisturizers at the pharmacy because most of them contain comedegenic ingredients and/or tighten the skin.  </li>
            <li> I have used this product for a year now and my skin has never been better.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve even used it to fight off a light attack of poison oak!</li>
            <li> When the package arrived it was all in one piece and looked ok.</li>
            <li> I love the feel of this wash on my face.</li>
            <li> My daughter has blackheads and acne that doesn&#x27;t respond to most OTC products.</li>
            <li> I use my face wash with a clarisonic mia as well so it gets the best cleaning possible.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> My family and I love The Body Shop Tea Tree products.</li>
            <li> Fantastic!</li>
            <li> For some reason the skin on my body is more accepting of it.</li>
            <li> I also love the smell.</li>
            <li> It is so refreshing</li>
            <li> I love the scent and gel texture.</li>
            <li> Free shipping at their website if you spend over $50 is a nice perk too.  </li>
            <li> And let me just say this product ok at first starts to show results that it&#x27;s working which made me feel good about purchasing the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Nice clean tea tree smell which isn&#x27;t too overpowering</li>
            <li> Love the soap, it does leave a strong Tea Tree scent after using, so make sure you like that smell.</li>
            <li> It leaves your face very clean feeling.</li>
            <li> Still, a great buy and probably works well for people with normal skin.</li>
            <li> Product seems pretty good.</li>
            <li> The smell is very calming and nice as well!</li>
            <li> It also has a clean, crisp scent that leaves my face feeling and smelling great.  </li>
            <li> It has a nice, mild tingle.</li>
            <li> It is a very specific type of smell, and if you haven&#x27;t used tea tree oil / products before, you will probably have to get used to it, but I actually really enjoy minty, herbal types of smells, so this was just perfect for me.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It gives a clean feeling!</li>
            <li> My girlfriend who has the most beautiful skin in the entire world (smooth af) has used this product for a while and recommended it to me because my skin is prone to regular acne breakouts, or so has been ever since I stopped using the anti acne cleanser that worked best for me.</li>
            <li> Very good facial cleanser</li>
            <li> I did investigate that if your looking for a very good facial wash to take acne away and</li>
            <li> great product, feels great, slightly tingly, makes my face feel fresh!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so much more comfortable with my skin</li>
            <li> which is what is most important to me.</li>
            <li> I like tea tree oil as its natural and its supposed to be great for acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> It hasn&#x27;t completely cleared my skin, but has done a great job in reducing the amount of breakouts.</li>
            <li> And most importantly, it works like a</li>
            <li> -- it&#x27;s great, but, wow...</li>
            <li> -- it&#x27;s great, but, wow...</li>
            <li> really appreciate that they supposedly do fair trade, help the environment, and against animal testing.</li>
            <li> Normally this is the best cleanser ever , when bought from the body shop , but this is not the real deal.</li>
            <li> It is a good product and really helpful.</li>
            <li> and it really appears to clean up my pours very nicely.  </li>
            <li> but this has a great effect right from first use.</li>
            <li> After finding out, I tried other products but found out that my skin works the best with this product.</li>
            <li> But it true does work wonders when you balance it with something else!</li>
            <li> every now and then as well as the tea tree oil toner, also by The Body Shop, to make sure that your skin is completely clean.  </li>
            <li> Love how clean and refreshed my skin feels after each wash.</li>
            <li> My skin is prone to breakouts but haven&#x27;t had any with this.&lt;br /&gt;Washed off easy.</li>
            <li> I tried so many of those popular brands and they didn&#x27;t really work well.</li>
            <li> the smell is awfully strong.</li>
            <li> I know Tea Tree Oil has a strong scent but the scent of this</li>
            <li> After using it, my face feels so smooth and clean!</li>
            <li> And it smells so good and natural!!</li>
            <li> That is pretty amazing, although I will not venture into saying that it&#x27;s cured my acne just yet.</li>
            <li> I just washed with it for the first time and I have to say it&#x27;s quite amazing.</li>
            <li> I was told its good for oily skin but not for normal skin...</li>
            <li> This stuff does an amazing job of keeping my skin clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> i love this item, special smell, comfortable feeling on my face and lots of foam.</li>
            <li> Smells fine.</li>
            <li> but it smells fine idk.</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE this whole line!</li>
            <li> I love that the face wash and the rest of the line has done away with my breakouts and evened my skin tone out so quickly.</li>
            <li> Works quickly, pleasant armor and assist in maintaining a clear complexion.</li>
            <li> It also seems to make existing pimples on my face run their course more quickly and lightens my scars.  </li>
            <li> Bought this for the hubby who has huge issues with oily skin.</li>
            <li> I am a huge fan of tea tree oil</li>
            <li> I am a HUGE fan of the Body Shop&#x27;s Tea Tree Oil</li>
            <li> Both of my teenage daughters use this with great results.  </li>
            <li> This face wash will make your skin tingle as you use it, and it will feel free afterward.</li>
            <li> This is alright as an everday light wash, and does its job alright.</li>
            <li> I use this with the Olay facial brush and have great results.</li>
            <li> It does leave my skin breakout free</li>
            <li> This product is great when combined with a facial puff.</li>
            <li> My skin always feels fresh and not over-dried as opposed to most oil control products.</li>
            <li> It also smelled great and last you quite a while before you run out to the store and get another one.</li>
            <li> Excellent results without being too harsh.</li>
            <li> MAKEUP FREE</li>
            <li> I really enjoy the way this product smells.</li>
            <li> And honestly the price for all three products is extremely reasonable for how well it works</li>
            <li> It effectively removes oil from my face and really clears my pores.</li>
            <li> This is gentle and effective.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a fabulous product</li>
            <li> It makes my skin smooth and reduces the oil.</li>
            <li> Well after several weeks of using it I am happy to say her acne has improved quite a bit.</li>
            <li> So I gave this a try and all it does is make my face feel smooth and refreshed, but the acne hasn&#x27;t stopped breaking out.</li>
            <li> I use it on my face with fantastic results.</li>
            <li> Of course, there is the free shipping deal from Amazon if you spend over $25, so shipping costs are not a problem for me.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Obviously, it has not gotten rid of all my acne over night (nothing can really do that), but it feels wonderful on my skin</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> My doctor prescribed MetroGel which is a very effective topical treatment, but I have been experimenting with the rest of my facial routine, and this wash is a welcome addition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My face has actually gotten much better after using this!!</li>
            <li> I used my first bottle for 5 months!!</li>
            <li> it is very effective, so I use it at night only.</li>
            <li> Leaves my face feeling stimulated and ultra clean, as well as smooth.  </li>
            <li> I really like this face wash , smells pretty good</li>
            <li> But it was quick and easy to use it.  </li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this cleanser after reading all of the amazing reviews.</li>
            <li> Update (original review on 1/6/15, update today 3/1/15)  </li>
            <li> My skin looks a lot better after using this consistently.</li>
            <li> Even though this face wash isn&#x27;t exactly &amp;#34;made&amp;#34; for me, I love it anyway.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kind of an extensive regimen, but it works better than anything I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li> but it leaves it clean and for moisturizing I have a moisturizer</li>
            <li> After i wash my face it feels refreshed and clean.</li>
            <li> The face wash works just like a charm and leaves my face feeling refreshed and clean afterwards.</li>
            <li> I love anything with tea tree oil in it because tea tree is a natural anti-fungal, sure to cure whatever is driving your skin</li>
            <li> My face doesn&#x27;t even feel clean after using it.</li>
            <li> And, my skin feels clean longer, with no oil.</li>
            <li> and you can feel the clean after using the wash.</li>
            <li> My face feels clean without drying it out.</li>
            <li> Leaves my face clean and feeling all tingly.</li>
            <li> It takes off all my makeup and oil and makes my skin feel and look so clean and clearer.</li>
            <li> It leaves my face clean and moisturized and it has drastically reduced my acne outbreaks.</li>
            <li> and I can feel how clean my face is father washing it.</li>
            <li> Has a pleasant aroma and seems like it will last a while.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t do much for my skin... love the smell.</li>
            <li> Effective in helping to keep my skin clear</li>
            <li> a good smell doesn&#x27;t take away these dang white heads.</li>
            <li> This is the only facewash I have used and it gets the job done as good as anything else.</li>
            <li> I wash my face with a spritz bottle full of distilled water.</li>
            <li> Makes me feel like it isn&#x27;t getting into my pores which I know isn&#x27;t true</li>
            <li> This brand is true tea-tree.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t get a full product.</li>
            <li> Overall good product...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cool~</li>
            <li> The tea tree oil really helps with acne and oiliness, and it smells and feels so refreshing.</li>
            <li> It also comes in a kit with a full size tea tree oil and mini sizes of their tea tree lotion &amp; toner for $25.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I have to say that I really have grown to love it.  </li>
            <li> and I have to say that I really have grown to love it.  </li>
            <li> used this for quite some time, and firstly the smell was extremely strong and not to pleasing.</li>
            <li> Give your face a fresh and clean feel.  </li>
            <li> My face always feels fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> , I thought it was just because of the hormones from being pregnant</li>
            <li> I went with this because of the extraordinary body shop tea tree astringent.</li>
            <li> , Resist C15 Super Booster (a vitimin C and E lotion) and the Eminence Blueberry Soy Night Recovery Cream.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m definitely loyal to this face wash now.</li>
            <li> It has made a tremendous difference for her.</li>
            <li> I love the smell to this product, however, if your skin dries up very easily, this product will dry you up.</li>
            <li> HIGHLY recommended if you&#x27;ve tried everything else and aren&#x27;t sure where else to turn.</li>
            <li> Thank you for making a whole set of products with such a natural, wonderful oil!    </li>
            <li> The toner is very refreshing and picks up whatever is left from the wash.</li>
            <li> I bought this product even though i have normal skin without many blemishes.  </li>
            <li> I also bought the scrub (which I love), the mask (which I love), and the cooling creme cleanser (which is a little oily feeling but it makes your skin feel very clean and refreshed).</li>
            <li> but it definitely gives a nice and clean feel after use.</li>
            <li> Your face feels clean and not tight like so many cleansers make the skin feel.</li>
            <li> I use so many new things at once</li>
            <li> I have found a new favorite.</li>
            <li> tree extracts have strong anti-bacterial properties, so if you suffer from breakouts or acne, this should really make a difference for your skin.</li>
            <li> I would have returned it, but then I discovered its other amazing use:  as a makeup brush cleaner!  </li>
            <li> After my third week of using all three Tea Tree Oil products, my face has never looked better!</li>
            <li> I would most likely repurchase this at full price!</li>
            <li> But 3 stars because it DOES work on certain people and makes one&#x27;s skin feel smooth</li>
            <li> I originally started using it because I&#x27;m pregnant and this facial wash is safe for your skin to use while pregnant as it doesn&#x27;t have the sacyllic acid or benzoyl peroxide in it, which can be toxic to your baby as its absorbed by your skin and into your blood stream.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to get emotional while writing this review because that&#x27;s how amazing this product is.</li>
            <li> At first, I was freaking out because for the first time in years I was getting huge pimples on my face that were taking forever to go away.</li>
            <li> Worth the money</li>
            <li> Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using products with benzoyl peroxide but wanted to try something more natural.</li>
            <li> I like the fresh cooling feeling</li>
            <li> It is so worth the price.</li>
            <li> Feels really fresh every time I use it.</li>
            <li> My 13  year old uses this regularly and it has GREATLY cleared up her skin.</li>
            <li> The light bulb went off, and I checked the ingredients and sure enough, SLS was in it.</li>
            <li> you are looking for fresh sensation so trust me and go ahead</li>
            <li> This facial wash smelled great and help clear up my blemishes.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s a more natural wash.</li>
            <li> so restoring my overall youthfullness was nice).</li>
            <li> Liked the way my face felt when I used this product, actually used it on the body too.  </li>
            <li> The smell is fresh.</li>
            <li> its worth a try.</li>
            <li> I came across The Body Shop&#x27;s (TBS) tea tree cleanser a few weeks ago and found I have really liked using it for many reasons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Normally, foaming and chemical-laden cleanser make my skin feel dry when I leave it on, but my skin felt great.</li>
            <li> I even have a cyst on my chin that it&#x27;s reducing very quickly, and I normally have to get shots of cortizone to make them go away.</li>
            <li> The reason we give it 4 stars instead of 5 is because it&#x27;s very strong and the tingling sensation is almost too much for her sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It gets the job done, right, every time.</li>
            <li> However, if you are wishing to use it right away the shipping does take a bit</li>
            <li> your face shine so this is the right product&lt;</li>
            <li> so this is the right product&lt;</li>
            <li> As I&#x27;m typing this right now acne is all across my forehead .</li>
            <li> When he uses this with the lotion, it clears his skin right up.</li>
            <li> It was too runny and didn&#x27;t smell right.</li>
            <li> It has a very strong smell, but served the purpose for my teenage step-daughter&#x27;s acne issues.  </li>
            <li> I dont have very strong facial acne</li>
            <li> I am 29 and have had some kind of acne for as long as I can remember.</li>
            <li> First of all, I shall stablish the fact that i have very greasy skin,&lt;br /&gt;Point being made, I really like this product, my skin feels really nice and soft, and it takes away the grease for quite a while during the day.</li>
            <li> I also add a little pure tea tree oil to the bottle as i really love tea tree oil and all its benefits!!</li>
            <li> My skin is so smooth and blemish free that I no longer wear foundation on a daily basis.  </li>
            <li> My skin is smooth and blemish free just by using this product for a solid week!  </li>
            <li> I love the fresh, energizing smell of this facial wash!</li>
            <li> But for the money I spent on it, I wish it worked better!</li>
            <li> So i am very very choosy, demanding and cautious about selecting any product for my skin.</li>
            <li> like it very much.</li>
            <li> I have very, very oily skin.</li>
            <li> it is a great cleanser that gives a deep down clean.</li>
            <li> Worked pretty well at first.</li>
            <li> I really love this facial wash!!</li>
            <li> At first I would wash my face with this two to three times a day</li>
            <li> Using more than once a day will result in your skin producing extra oils, which in turn makes you break out.</li>
            <li> When I first started using this product, I was HOOKED.</li>
            <li> It seems counterintuitive to use moisturizer on an oily face, but that&#x27;s exactly what you have to do</li>
            <li> Some of the best results you can imagine without the long term consequences of harsh acid-based products.</li>
            <li> After using it consistently for 6 weeks I switched back to using a La Roche Posay cleanser, and my skin immediately started to look and feel better.</li>
            <li> After using this only one time at night (along with the tea tree toner and tea tree lotion) I noticed that in the morning my skin looked significantly better.</li>
            <li> He has been using all three products for about two weeks &amp; we are definitely seeing a change in his acne for the better.</li>
            <li> I had tried so many different products to get rid of the acne</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my third bottle and have been acne free since!</li>
            <li> I tried switching to other brands with same ingredients but they dint give as good results as Body shop  !&lt;</li>
            <li> I have only used this product two or three times now, but I really love it.  </li>
            <li> and I have tried soo many different products and home remedies for my skin that didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> Has a very minty smell, but I can feel it cleansing my skin!</li>
            <li> pretty badly.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend the Tea Tree Oil wash from the Body Shop!!</li>
            <li> the first time I used it, it smelled kinda funky.. but feels like a tingly sensation on your face so to me</li>
            <li> And is soooo much cheaper than others on the market!</li>
            <li> and I have been using this whole line since!</li>
            <li> Thanks Body Shop!</li>
            <li> It smells funny.</li>
            <li> I really like this product!</li>
            <li> , I read  on some sites that at first the face &#x27;&amp;#34;purges&amp;#34;&amp;#34; but it has been 11 days</li>
            <li> but I really like this product the most because first its my favorite color green.</li>
            <li> My first time trying this product</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s pretty even keeled</li>
            <li> So soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> It is silky smooth coming off and my skin is soft as well.</li>
            <li> FAST!</li>
            <li> TBS also runs sales and emails me coupons, so I would be able to purchase at a reduced price in the future (though I did purchase this using a 20% off coupon code).  </li>
            <li> Anything tea tree oil is good but some products can be harsh.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a lot more smooth and less oily than before.</li>
            <li> This does leave my face very clean but also turns my skin red for about an hour after washing with this.</li>
            <li> , although the product decreases my acne significantly, it doesn&#x27;t completely PREVENT is from appearing on my skin.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin so soft and it feels so fresh!</li>
            <li> My daughter has very sensitive skin, and other products have not been good for her.</li>
            <li> Proactiv dries her skin, Clean and Clear does not keep the pimples away, and Nuetragena leaves her oily.</li>
            <li> The Body Shop keeps her skin clear and clean, without over-drying.  </li>
            <li> After wash the skin feels soft n so clean.</li>
            <li> Then it just started really drying out my extremely oily skin and caused me to break out even more!</li>
            <li> even so I would recommend using a really good facial moisturizer to keep your skin from producing those extra oils.</li>
            <li> The Body Shop Tea Tree Oil face wash is something I would confidently recommend to anyone looking for something gentle that will totally remove acne and breakouts.</li>
            <li> and I have nothing but positive things to say.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 34 and get breakouts (thanks, stress), but this product is so consistent for me.</li>
            <li> clean and fresh feeling after facial wash with this.</li>
            <li> I recommend trying something less drying or use some kind of moisturizer or lotion.</li>
            <li> (it doesn&#x27;t have to be exact, just close), rinse brushes in mixture, and it&#x27;ll transform your old makeup brushes into their original soft, brand-new condition.  </li>
            <li> It works really well for him and the bottle lasts forever.</li>
            <li> I bought the whole line.</li>
            <li> Please save your money and buy something else because i have very oily skin</li>
            <li> and I do not break out as much.</li>
            <li> But it doesn&#x27;t help as much as I had anticipated.</li>
            <li> This line has helped so much.  </li>
            <li> I have had acne my whole life and in my 30s now.</li>
            <li> I really wanted this to work</li>
            <li> I think people tend to use too much face wash.</li>
            <li> I really like this product a lot.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this product, but no luck!</li>
            <li> of tea tree cleansers is very watery</li>
            <li> What really inspired me to write was the minty, menthol-like feeling I had while washing my face.</li>
            <li> Really like this face wash.</li>
            <li> but I will continue using it and hope it really works.</li>
            <li> It has really helped me with my skin issues.</li>
            <li> My skin type is very oily(around the nose and under my eyes)</li>
            <li> Something about it is very therapeutic.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the real deal, I&#x27;ve been using this product for years but moved to an area where there&#x27;s not a Body Shop in convenient distance.</li>
            <li> this is also another way I know it&#x27;s the real thing.</li>
            <li> I really like the scent</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t really see any noticeable differences on my face after using this product for quite some time.</li>
            <li> This caused me to break out and have really horrendous acne problems that I hadn&#x27;t had since I was a teenager.</li>
            <li> i really like this wash.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t really feel my face as refreshed as I would like it.  </li>
            <li> Really cleans my skin well and helps with acne</li>
            <li> I use this with my Clairsonic Mia 2, I have very oily acne prone skin</li>
            <li> and it really helps there skin..</li>
            <li> I like washing my face with this so much.</li>
            <li> Dr Pham my eye doctor recommended I really like the product it is working very well for me.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> We had a very humid Summer, so my skin was very oily.  </li>
            <li> We had a very humid Summer, so my skin was very oily.  </li>
            <li> I failed to mention above that I have sensitive, combination, acne-prone skin, so it&#x27;s rather a nightmare to find a good cleanser at a good price.  </li>
            <li> I failed to mention above that I have sensitive, combination, acne-prone skin, so it&#x27;s rather a nightmare to find a good cleanser at a good price.  </li>
            <li> usually use neutrogena deep clean, but I feel like this stuff might clean and fight oily skin a bit better.  </li>
            <li> I recommend completely!!!</li>
            <li> Although i used this product and found it to be better than the other acne facial cleansers i have used i found the Neutrogena Rapid Clear Foaming Scrub to be much better at clearing my skin.</li>
            <li> I woke up yesterday morning and was in such a fantastic mood because my skin looked BEAUTIFUL (or at least relatively so).</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin soft and feeling clean and clear.</li>
            <li> The scent is non-existent, whereas with the original, the tea tree oil is obviously present.</li>
            <li> I just had a baby a couple months ago and due to lovely hormones my face was breaking out.</li>
            <li> My skin has improved significantly since I started using this daily.</li>
            <li> She has tried other products, this one is her favorite.</li>
            <li> I think for my face, the most beneficial OTC treatment has always been benzoyl peroxide, although that is also extremely drying.  </li>
            <li> I really wish I could find some batches of the older face wash to buy in bulk...</li>
            <li> I use this as the last thing to clean my face, neck, chest, shoulders, and anywhere else</li>
            <li> It truly leaves my face squeaky clean when used with my spinning facial brush.</li>
            <li> I usually follow up my regimen with the tea tree toner with takes more excess oil off and I am left with a fresh clean face.</li>
            <li> It does not dry out my skin, and leaves it soft and smooth feeling.  </li>
            <li> I am 26 and got my first break out of adult acne.</li>
            <li> but if you have sensitive skin I would try something else first.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re not sure about it, there&#x27;s a mini version of it on TBS&#x27;s website for $4, which makes for a nice travel size as well.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a fantastic cleanser for the price, and it lasts a long time!</li>
            <li> I have accidentally let run down my eyes while using my clairsonic in the shower, other than that I love this product!!</li>
            <li> I use konjac facial sponge in the morning and an electronic facial brush in the evening, and I always reach for the tea tree facial wash from The Body Shop to make sure my skin gets some extra boost of healthy ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So I need to use only mild, non-perfumed, alcohol-free products.</li>
            <li> For instance, I really like Dermaquest&#x27;s enzyme cleanser ($30) and Cor&#x27;s silver soap ($40), but they are rather expensive -- great products though.  </li>
            <li> (it&#x27;s really hard looking for jobs and being confident on interviews right out of college when your skin is blotchy and blemished)</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended for acne or oily skin.</li>
            <li> , I had high hopes for this product.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product to others.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend if you are a fan of tea tree products.</li>
            <li> Once I used just a little for a week then built up, it was much better.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not popping acne, I&#x27;m more like little blemishes here and there, but it hasn&#x27;t cleared me of those yet...</li>
            <li> I like the body wash a little better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m highly dissapointed in allll their products because I purchased the whole set and were a complete let</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, the tea tree facial wash is worth trying if you have combination skin, as I have found it hasn&#x27;t dried me out, yet seems to leave my skin feeling clean and fresh.  </li>
            <li> It helps clear my pimples and prevent it -works fast too.</li>
            <li> I just wanted something to clear my blackheads, I dont really have acne prone skin unless I forget to wash my face.</li>
            <li> This tea tree skin cleanser really helps to keep my face clear of blemishes.  </li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really seem to clear up any blemishes.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s too expensive because it&#x27;s a pretty good sized bottle.</li>
            <li> But after a few months of this stuff, my skin has never looked better.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love using just a few drops of this all over my face in my morning shower.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;ve had it nearly 3 years), but I have been really liking their new acne head as of late.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is more clear and brighter in appearance and the blemishes are less.</li>
            <li> This wash keeps my face free and clear of blemishes, and it doesn&#x27;t leave my face dry at all.  </li>
            <li> Dries my skin out a little more than I&#x27;d like, and doesn&#x27;t clean it as well as other face washes I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li> and I wasn&#x27;t really a huge fan of this product, think I&#x27;ll stick to other brands.</li>
            <li> Other than that, I enjoy the line.</li>
            <li> But if you have normal, dry, sensitive or mixed skin type you better use something else.</li>
            <li> I combined the tea tree face wash with my new clairsonic and within weeks the zits diminished drastically.</li>
            <li> I have been using the body shop tea tree system (face wash, toner, moisturizer) and unless you use some other kind of moisturizer (I use a vitamin e coconut oil) it will dry out your skin.</li>
            <li> , I am using an anti biotic now to clear my face and will go back to just using my old mild face wash and BP .</li>
            <li> for me :) little did i know, this coupon experience was going to change my face for ever!</li>
            <li> This is a favorite for both my wife and I. Many other facial washes (especially ones that are castile soap based) seem to leave the face very dry and sometimes sting a bit when using.</li>
            <li> I have an oily and very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyway, i have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin, and this is what I wanted.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s completely  clear!</li>
            <li> They weren&#x27;t exactly pimples, red, or itchy.</li>
            <li> This is the only product that has ever left me feeling confident enough to go</li>
            <li> The product itself, kind of irritated my skin in a way that it gave it that burning sensation, but definitely not in a good way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I usually order 3 at a time and people buy me this product as part of my gifts :)  </li>
            <li> This skin wash has continued to help me fight adult acne!  </li>
            <li> The viscosity is off too: the original is much thicker than this green water I received.</li>
            <li> After a while of using it, I started getting extremely sensitive around my nose area, it would get SUPER itchy and flaky and uncomfortable and it&#x27;d be bright red, though this problem was fixed with applying some moisturizer after use.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t reduce redness but it leaves face fresh and un oily or dry.</li>
            <li> It´s a little bit strong for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> and it really is the same original facial wash from the physical Body Shop.</li>
            <li> Hands down, my favorite facial wash ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Ok so I was a little skeptical buying this product at first because literally every other product I have tried had not been successful.</li>
            <li> Love this product, will definitely be looking for other tea tree products of this line!</li>
            <li> Stubborn and deep blackheads and also large, clogged pores.</li>
            <li> I guess this product only works well for certain skin type people.</li>
            <li> Now that the winter air is here, it&#x27;s a little drying but a light moisturizer is all you need.</li>
            <li> Still get the occasional pimple, but they&#x27;re nowhere near as large or long-lasting as before.</li>
            <li> Also, if you are sensitive to strong scents, maybe steer clear of this because it has a very odd smell.</li>
            <li> My non-oily face turbed into a super oily one, probably due to hormones.</li>
            <li> I have only been using it for a little over a week, and my complexion is already more clear.</li>
            <li> This does help clear the breakouts and keep them at bay.</li>
            <li> I do believe the tea tree oil is helping my skin condition to clear.</li>
            <li> So, if you are like me and are looking for a product to clear blackheads then l would not recommend this.</li>
            <li> Not wonderful for makeup but defiantly great to use after my regular wash</li>
            <li> Has helped clear my face in a month&#x27;s use.</li>
            <li> It helps to clear and control ay outbreaks I may experience.</li>
            <li> This helped clear up a lot of the redness and pimple looking places that the ingrown hairs had been and helped clear them up.</li>
            <li> My skin is basically clear from pimples now</li>
            <li> My skin stays clear and balanced.</li>
            <li> After 3 months of using three products routinely her skin is 80% clear.</li>
            <li> If you are use to having acne breakouts, especially around your cycle, this face wash really helps to limit the break outs.  </li>
            <li> Pros: the face wash has a cooling effect on the skin, it is light enough for everyday use and doesn&#x27;t seem to strip my skin of too much oil&lt;</li>
            <li> also this face wash is not organic or 100 percent natural...</li>
            <li> Curing a long term outbreak requires repeated and consistent use.  </li>
            <li> Besides no staph I do not have any adult acne breakouts or problems.  </li>
            <li> My skin is so soft and tingly when I use it.</li>
            <li> As far as the product itsself</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m ready to buy the second bottle.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I worry about longterm use of BP and will keep searching for natural alternatives.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if this is an all natural organic product, but it appears to work quite well.</li>
            <li> I stopped using soaps and shampoos with it, but because I thought this was a natural product I still used it.</li>
            <li> Afterwards, I couldn&#x27;t believe how soft my skin felt.</li>
            <li> Works just as described, leaving your face feeling smooth and not oily without being dried out.</li>
            <li> These ingredients are known as the products that work directly with your acne.</li>
            <li> far as the effectiveness, I cant say.</li>
            <li> I have adult acne and rosacea and it&#x27;s not helping either of them -</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin feeling soft and plump.</li>
            <li> And, over the years I have developed something inside of my body that arrived to my scalp and face.  </li>
            <li> (I feel so busy).  </li>
            <li> but it cleans my face, I&#x27;ve used it for a week now and my face feels soft.</li>
            <li> Gentle enough</li>
            <li> It has not dried my skin out...yet.</li>
            <li> A really gentle cleanser that you can use daily.  </li>
            <li> I have also used with my facial scrubber and it is still gentle on the face.  </li>
            <li> The case is that, though my skin is very-very oily, it is also very-very sensitive.</li>
            <li> Before my skin changed, I was completely reliant on this line from The Body Shop.</li>
            <li> So as far as blemishes and acne goes, this product DID NOT WORK FOR ME.</li>
            <li> My skin feels so refreshed and soft after I&#x27;m done.  </li>
            <li> It makes my hands soft too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy</li>
            <li> My face is like baby butt soft</li>
            <li> /&gt;First off, I have sensitive, combination and acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> My face, at first, couldn&#x27;t take how strong the tea tree was and the acne got worse.  </li>
            <li> It just ok types, nothing different than other facial soap.</li>
            <li> : The first week I used it, my skin was REALLY DRY.  </li>
            <li> But, only for young skin, this did nothing to please my older skin.  </li>
            <li> I began using this right after I developed a skin allergy due to SLS.</li>
            <li> I have seen a tremendous change on my skin ever since I started using it: it is less oily</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m lucky enough that my acne is not as severe as it was when I was younger, but it is still moderate at all times.</li>
            <li> My skin is not less oily, but that&#x27;s a hormone thing, I think.</li>
            <li> It actually seemed like it was helping reduce the amount of acne on my face the first week but by the third week....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for almost two months now and have not noticed any improvement to my skin, no less acne or redness.</li>
            <li> There is a slight &amp;#34;tea tree&amp;#34; scent from it, which doesn&#x27;t bother me and seems to go away quickly.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it was really old or if it was watered down or not even the right stuff at all .</li>
            <li> when I use this, I usually let sit on my face for a bit just to enjoy the smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t really have acne, nor did I ever suffered from it, but I do get occasional break-outs and plenty of red spots, so I was looking for something to help clear up my skin and improve its health.</li>
            <li> , normally I look 18 when I&#x27;m actually 30</li>
            <li> After using this product for a few day it has began to Not bad at all for money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if its worth the double the neutrogena price, but I&#x27;ll enjoy this bottle and reevaluate when it&#x27;s empty</li>
            <li> As somebody who suffers from chronic acne, I&#x27;m always in the lookout for a great facial wash.</li>
            <li> Doesnt dry my skin out too much, Controls oil and shine, doesn&#x27;t induce acne</li>
            <li> I love the tingly, cold, fresh sensations it gives.</li>
            <li> I had a facial recently and my facialist told me I should try tea tree oil products because they are anti-fungal and really help oil the acne causing bacteria.</li>
            <li> This smells pretty good, has a bit of a camphor smell (not exactly but difficult to pinpoint the actual smell).</li>
            <li> Needless to say, at 25 i have tried so many products and systems, toners, you name it!</li>
            <li> Now don&#x27;t expect a miracle, if your hormones are crazy, your young, pregnant or its that time of the month for the ladies, whatever reason, you will have light break outs from time to time.</li>
            <li> The smell is amazing and usually wakes me up a little bit.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use this and the foaming tea tree facial cleanser every day, and my face is 99% clear 99% of the time.</li>
            <li> I use the body shop tea tree line daily for years; it has kept my face amazingly clear and hydrated.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;re going to add the face mask next and see if we can get her skin totally clear.</li>
            <li> I just had to start using an entirely different brand completely.</li>
            <li> I had to go back to my old products.</li>
            <li> I recently bought this product directly from the body shop in lenox mall.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work for my acne, but I may just have stubborn adult acne that requires medical help.</li>
            <li> I use this facial wash every morning as I have adult acne.  </li>
            <li> Second it has a natural anti bacterial agent in tea tree oil.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s also the fact that every single one of these products is extremely drying, which will only irritate your face more if you have naturally dry skin.  </li>
            <li> While washing, I actually left it on for half a minute to see how well it absorbed.</li>
            <li> If you have normal skin, you may get dry skin...</li>
            <li> Everyone is different one of my friends used this product for 1 1/2 month- 3 months and face is very clear from black pore and acne, i like FAST result which you have to be patient and keep using it to see results...</li>
            <li> I thought other women would really benefit.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a good acne cleanser, I would suggest you keep looking because unfortunately this one is NOT it!</li>
            <li> Invigorating scent, and really strips down to the bare skin.</li>
            <li> I have fairly clear, slightly oily skin normally.</li>
            <li> my skin is still not clear clear</li>
            <li> I have noticed that throughout the months I&#x27;ve been using this (nearly a year), I have had nearly NO breakouts or problem pimples.</li>
            <li> I am not sure if there are mint in it, because my skin felt really fresh after using</li>
            <li> I decided to try this out and after the first night&#x27;s use i could see that my face was way less oily!</li>
            <li> The body shop tea tree skin clearing facial wash has not a single trace of benzoyl peroxide or salicylic acid.</li>
            <li> and I can imagine if you have a sensitive skin, this product may dry your skin out.</li>
            <li> I bought this to help my sensitive, combination (closer to dry), acne-prone skin.  </li>
            <li> It leaves your face clean enough to literally shine, and for me it made me look less weathered, (I&#x27;ve been having some down days</li>
            <li> After a few months of using these product, I&#x27;m starting to notice the positive benefits that it has had on my acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Probably too drying for sensitive or dry skin, but that&#x27;s not the purpose of this stuff!</li>
            <li> The further down the list of ingredients, the lower concentration of that particular ingredient.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had other natural facial remedies that were semi-effective</li>
            <li> You only need a tiny amount and if you only use it once a day this bottle will last a long time.</li>
            <li> I wake up and my skin has like an oily soft feel to it, but not like extremely oily if that makes any sense</li>
            <li> I bought this product a little over a month ago because I&#x27;ve always had a problem with acne on my chin and figured a natural facial wash might be the key to helping.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;In terms of value, I find it is decent, as a little does seem like it goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> This product works very well, and isn&#x27;t harsh on my skin at all!</li>
            <li> I gave this three stars because its not bad, just not great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had bad skin since middle school, and nothing has really worked to consistently keep it clear.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several other prescription drugs and topical creams and everything possible at the drug store and nothing has worked...until this!</li>
            <li> The only problem is it gets my skin dry and</li>
            <li> I can buy it for far less here on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tries several different products over the years but have found the one I won&#x27;t change from.</li>
            <li> I cannot remember the last time I woke up with no new blemishes to ruin my day.</li>
            <li> Definitely helps clear pores and a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s only getting worse, I am not sure if it will eventually get better</li>
            <li> but this is ridiculous after the first time using it.</li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s the real scoop on this product - you can use really harsh chemicals like ProActive (or other acid based acne cures) but you will not be doing yourself any favors.  </li>
            <li> In the winter or extreme heat of summer, it is even harder to keep my sensitive skin from cracking.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin, and it does not dry it out in the least</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a long time user of the Tea Tree items at The Body Shop.</li>
            <li> a while back, but then again, we really never know when it comes to products.</li>
            <li> I never really got acne such as my forehead.</li>
            <li> Way too harsh for my sensitive skin-</li>
            <li> I had minor breakouts and was hoping that this would help.  </li>
            <li> I carefully researched the condition, purchased The Body Shop Tea Tree Skin Clearing Facial Wash, Paula&#x27;s Choice Skin</li>
            <li> I have not used this wash for long.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried almost every off-the-shelf product, spent a couple years on Proactive, and have tried 3 or 4 different topical prescriptions, all with minimal reliable results.</li>
            <li> Since I am so oily I have been suffering from breakouts as long as I can remember.</li>
            <li> One bottle goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my 13 year old son and he uses it everyday and loves it.  </li>
            <li> I have long had Seborrheic dermatitis on my checks, and have always had to use prescription steroid creams to keep it under control.</li>
            <li> I just found out about using tea tree oil based products for acne not to long ago.  </li>
            <li> I have literally tried every single over the counter wash with little or no results, so I turned to natural solutions.</li>
            <li> And lastly ever since I have been using this product I feel my skin is cleaner less likely to get acne.</li>
            <li> When i use it regularly (daily), i start to feel that my skin&#x27;s blemishes will slowly disappear and leaves my face skin really clear!</li>
            <li> Hated this cleanser,it actually made me break out more than I have since high school.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m definitely going to look into the Body Shop&#x27;s other products in the Tea Tree collection.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t hurt my face (just a little sting with the BHA Liquid but nothing like the harsh &amp;#34;medicine&amp;#34; the doctor prescribed) and my skin is much improved.</li>
            <li> product is a little over-drying for me personally, so I will only be using it a couple of times per week.</li>
            <li> This facial wash can dry your skin out, or at least strip your skin of all the natural oils.</li>
            <li> and so when you are overly dry and do not moisturize, your face will break out.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave my face dry nor moisturized after washing it</li>
            <li> I also have dry skin</li>
            <li> and this does not irritate or over dry.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin depending on the type of skin condition that you have.</li>
            <li> For me, it can leave my skin a bit dry</li>
            <li> and I must admit it did dry up the oily parts of my face with the toner and wash</li>
            <li> If you find your face is a bit dry</li>
            <li> does, however, dry out my nose like crazy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it does dry your skin</li>
            <li> people who are naturally prone to acne either have really dry skin or combination skin and this product does not work for the former type of skin at least.  </li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t seem to dry it out or anything.  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t about to go back on it, so I floated around from product to product for the next few years.    </li>
            <li> I have oily skin and am prone to breakouts, but am also getting older and wanted something less harsh.</li>
            <li> I had NO new pimples.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve been using this face wash for over a week now with no new breakouts.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what it is as I&#x27;ve applied tea tree oil directly to my face before without a problem.</li>
            <li> but that is the only down side.</li>
            <li> It not only clears the skin but also helps prevent acne and black heads.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not super prone to cystic acne, but occasionally I get it</li>
            <li> My skin is less red, I have fewer breakouts, and fewer scars.</li>
            <li> I had a total of 4 staph infections in less than 6 months and they couldn&#x27;t seem to stop them.  </li>
            <li> I suffered from hormonal acne, black heads and the occasional pimple.</li>
            <li> If you are a person who only occasionally gets a pimple then 100% Natural Tea Tree oil can definitely work as a spot treatment, but this whole set of chemical crap....</li>
            <li> and I only have to squirt out a small amount of cleanser to soap up my entire face.</li>
            <li> and I returned the product because it made my skin very dry.</li>
            <li> Turned out my face very dry and itchy</li>
            <li> So I added a little bit of deep moisturizer in combination with the Tea Tree Skin Clearing Lotion which helped a lot!</li>
            <li> Only thing I will say is try to avoid it spilling down to your eyes because of the tea tree it does leave a tingling effect!</li>
            <li> I know I&#x27;ve only been using this for a few days so if my results change</li>
            <li> So be careful with that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s a mental thing</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not much of a &#x27;product-face-wash&#x27; kinda guy</li>
            <li> After only a few days, I can already see and feel the difference.</li>
            <li> I used about a dime size of this product, washed my face and instantly my face was over dried and flaky.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this tea tree facial wash for a few weeks now and have noticed a difference in the clarity of my skin.</li>
            <li> no thanks.  </li>
            <li> Everything was delivered as expected and at an unbeatable price.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> My skin is also very dry, so I use the Tea Tree exfoliant every other day, and Vitamin E moisturizers.</li>
            <li> Simple and plain</li>
            <li> This product contains a host of comedegenics (as do a lot of, if not most OTC acne creams/lotions), including but not limited to sodium laureth sulfate, hydrogenated castor oil, etc.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m noticing less blackheads and less acne overall.</li>
            <li> My 13 year old daughter has been using it for the past few weeks and is already seeing a difference with her acne.</li>
            <li> Less dry patches as well.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way as well.</li>
            <li> it does leave your skin feeling tight, but doesnt dry it out to where your skin is over-producing oils.</li>
            <li> other</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t get past the fact that it actually smells like a bathroom cleaning product though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also using other face washes (2% salicylic acid, 10% benzoyl peroxide), so maybe it&#x27;s the combination of Teatree and the other face washes that is stopping the breakouts.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t overdry like other acne washes</li>
            <li> Even though, I am way past being a teenager, I was still getting occasional bumps and pimples.  </li>
            <li> I went out and bought 7 other products from the tea tree line AND told my friends to go out and buy some too, which they did.</li>
            <li> which is why there are a couple other tea tree moisturizers by The Body Shop to choose from.  </li>
            <li> The hospital did a CT because they were worried about the infection getting into my eye and other areas and doing permanent damage.  </li>
            <li> Been using this for almost two weeks maybe around every other day.</li>
            <li> And, I took the advice of some women and used Tea Tree Oil or some other oils or witch-hazel, afterwards.  </li>
            <li> honesly had &#x27;&#x27;scales&#x27;&#x27; on my 60+years&#x27; face and other irritations.  </li>
            <li> Just not sure how thorough it cleans my make-up left inside the pores .</li>
            <li> Other than that, we&#x27;ll see with the skin</li>
            <li> I have been dealing with breakouts ever since I can remember and since I started using this (daily), a few weeks ago, my skin has been clearer than ever before!</li>
            <li> I tried some other ones to see if they take care of my acne.</li>
            <li> I will not use any other face wash after discovering this.</li>
            <li> and i gave it more time to clear my face up and after using for 4 to 5 weeks my acne just got worse!!!!</li>
            <li> it gets a little dry.</li>
            <li> I had a lot of problems with large, painful chin acne after I had my son, and now it has almost completely disappeared.</li>
            <li> Usually I would always have mascara and makeup  left over after other face washes that would end up on my towel, but not with this one!</li>
            <li> I keep telling him to use just a little bit, because a little goes a long way with this.....</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong, this product DOES work on certain people.</li>
            <li> This stuff used to work wonders on my skin a year or two back, but they changed the ingredients and now it doesn&#x27;t work hardly at all.</li>
            <li> It feels a little weird at first (leaves an oily feeling on your face) but</li>
            <li> You only need a little to lather over your face and the bottle although small has a lot of product in there.  </li>
            <li> Its hard to rate personal items</li>
            <li> It sounds silly, but I really am.</li>
            <li> Okay...but not worth the money...</li>
            <li> but it was average in my opinion.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s my only complaint.</li>
            <li> Im in my late twenties and recently started breaking out after my child was born.</li>
            <li> To me, it is not worth the price when I see no difference.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s clearing the dark spots I had on my face from when I picked my face, they&#x27;re almost gone.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to slowly acquire the entire tea tree line.</li>
            <li> It was annoying and it never got better.</li>
            <li> the top of the cap was busted off which is annoying.</li>
            <li> I must have really sensitive skin or something, because every time I used this, I broke out even worse than before.</li>
            <li> , tea tree oil is FAR DOWN on the ingredients list, and number of ingredients (too much unnecessary junk in it)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I think it helps well with keeping my acne down.</li>
            <li> Although, you might need moisturizer for between your eyes, and down along the sides of your nose-</li>
            <li> She is not brushing her hair down to hide her face anymore.</li>
            <li> I received the product promptly, however there was a little dent on one of the bottles, probs due to the shipping process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I will never use any other product again!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually have over oily skin or dry skin</li>
            <li> I tried every over the counter face wash, everything the dermatologist recommended, going on myocycline, sprionolactone, and even spending six months on a high dose of accutane (which, if you haven&#x27;t heard of it, causes crazy birth defects if you get pregnant while using it and can cause depression, and in my case made mine worse, and can also mess with your cholesterol pretty badly).</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t use it everyday due to that side effect.</li>
            <li> and I have to say its working like a Boss, and I switch when I was my face like late at night around 9 or a little earlier at 6pm.</li>
            <li> I have a slight break out on my forhead.</li>
            <li> I am inLove with this face wash and would recommend to every girl who has slight oily skin.</li>
            <li> I am wearing less concealer, foundation, and powder than I ever have.</li>
            <li> I found a slight increase of breakouts when using this product.</li>
            <li> , the shape of the bottle makes it seem like there is less product...</li>
            <li> It gets rid of black heads too.</li>
            <li> face has been less oily and that has reduced my breakouts to practically none.</li>
            <li> i typically use washes with benzol peroxide which work well for me, but i like to give my skin a break from</li>
            <li> , my skin is less clogged up.</li>
            <li> I have less breakouts since using this product.</li>
            <li> I have noticed I am breaking out a lot less now</li>
            <li> ( A LOT LESS)</li>
            <li> Additionally, my skin never felt irritated after washing, which is very typical with other cleansers.  </li>
            <li> Additionally, my skin never felt irritated after washing, which is very typical with other cleansers.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately I had to stop useing it due to a rash that developed  after about 5 days.</li>
            <li> Slightly astringent, and a little drying which is what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> if you don&#x27;t close it&#x27;s cap tightly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very unfortunate, too, because after years of doctor/dermatologist visits, and over-the-counter medications, I had finally found something that all but completely cleared my skin.</li>
            <li> , I wish it had little beads for easier makeup removal</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a little over a month and don&#x27;t know how I ever lived without it.</li>
            <li> I was looking for something to help with getting rid of blackheads and other small blemishes.  </li>
            <li> If you let it sit a little you can feel it working.</li>
            <li> Sometimes these Tea Tree is a little hyped.</li>
            <li> I use a little in the morning in the shower and then wash my face with it before I go to bed.</li>
            <li> but it threw me off a little that there was no lather or bubbles.</li>
            <li> It seems to help a little with acne.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t need to use a lot of the wash just a little bit</li>
            <li> Now after using this face wash and DermaZinc cream for a little over a month I&#x27;ve stopped using my prescription.</li>
            <li> and this made me breakout more than any product ive ever used and gave me horrible dry patches.</li>
            <li> My blemishes has gone down alot!  </li>
            <li> but it dried my skin and caused little red bumps and basically acne got worse.</li>
            <li> I was just about desperate enough to go back on accutane</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve used this for a few days in conjuntion with Tea tree toner , lotion and fade cream and seems to help with my cystic acne</li>
            <li> Update After using it for a few months</li>
            <li> I went on accutane when I was 16 (six years ago) and for a few months after the course, my skin was alright.</li>
            <li> I might write an update a few weeks from now to follow up.</li>
            <li> I tried it for a few weeks and couldn&#x27;t handle it.</li>
            <li> I bought this a few days ago.</li>
            <li> so my face doesn&#x27;t get too dried out or irritated.</li>
            <li> I stopped using it, and after a few weeks, I looked semi-normal again.</li>
            <li> use this everyday twice</li>
            <li> so I do moisturize a few minutes after using the lotion.</li>
            <li> It dried it after finishing washing my face.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s green color and</li>
            <li> Some of the product was missing from the bottle.</li>
            <li> I also appreciate that this wash isn&#x27;t perfumed heavily.</li>
            <li> I use the face wash and lotion everyday and around my PMS times</li>
            <li> My face actually looks worse.</li>
            <li> (Just be patient and give it a few weeks to kick in before you give up.)</li>
            <li> I dont always remember to wash my face daily, but this product makes me want to take the time to do it no matter how tired i am, because of how refreshed my face feels afterwards.</li>
            <li> I use this wash everyday along with the toner.</li>
            <li> She was having trouble with acne</li>
            <li> but I do get few zits here and there.</li>
            <li> i wash my face everyday with it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care for it, but it&#x27;s not a HUGE deal)</li>
            <li> My MAC brush cleaner, a product designed for this purpose, doesn&#x27;t work half as well!</li>
            <li> I start with plain coconut oil as makeup remover.</li>
            <li> and it STINKS to high heaven.</li>
            <li> In addition to drying out my skin, it broke me out pretty bad.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of redness and blemishes, was very skeptical about this product as nothing has ever really worked for me.</li>
            <li> I paid a few bucks for my toner and facial wash and it sad</li>
            <li> It tends to chip and be hard to close after a few uses.</li>
            <li> My skin is combo/oily, and it tends to go crazy in the summertime, so I was hoping the tea tree oil would clear up breakouts and get rid of the excess oil.</li>
            <li> but I usually use Dove unscented before this.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but oh well, on to trying to find something else... :\</li>
            <li> Well, it&#x27;s been a few months now and the feeling I once had for it has slowly gone away.</li>
            <li> After using it only three times I am already obsessed.</li>
            <li> I like it though I&#x27;m not sure it has improved my skin.</li>
            <li> All i know is i used to think facewash was pointless</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is the actual product (flawed design in the cap and all, the cap is brittle and shatters itself asunder, something that happens every time I buy it from the store) the smell of the product changes over time</li>
            <li> This facial wash was not perfect for my skin.</li>
            <li> I have rosacea and have tried countless expensive cleansers.</li>
            <li> I do usually write reviews for things I purchase but thought I should share my opinion.</li>
            <li> I am not sure what the concentration of tea tree extract is in this product, but judging by the smell, it is quite a bit.</li>
            <li> I presume that the amount of menthol is very-very small and used for perfuming purposes, but maybe it can also cause skin</li>
            <li> and I have been using it for the past 5 months now</li>
            <li> I am not sure if it does anything to help prevent or reduce that</li>
            <li> I would say no benefit to any other cleanser I have used maybe worse.</li>
            <li> I have to admit this facial wash smells terrible, but it seems to be working really well.</li>
            <li> just wanted to use it because I have broken out lately for no real reason</li>
            <li> The smell is not very good.</li>
            <li> I began using this face wash when I had broken out pretty badly on my forehead.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m working hard trying to finish a book.  </li>
            <li> I must be a hard pressed type of complexion ahaha.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought this for my little brother, who is just starting to get really bad acne.</li>
            <li> crazy this may actually be the reason.</li>
            <li> This face wash has been the only thing that helped my skin during a crazy break out that clinique acne didn&#x27;t even touch.</li>
            <li> The dermatologist prescribed a number of expensive creams that had absolutely no effect either.</li>
            <li> When I say everything, I mean it.</li>
            <li> I do still get a random zit every other month</li>
            <li> I mean oily to the fact that when I wash my face I start oiling up again in 3-5 minutes.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re used to the product that would be directly purchased from The Body Shop, you will be greatly disappointed.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave my face gleaming, but it&#x27;s not a complete disappointment.</li>
            <li> Seriously, if you have acne-prone skin and have tried everything else, give this a shot.</li>
            <li> I have never had bad skin and if i ever broke out it was during that time of month and only lasted a couple of days.</li>
            <li> I gave it 4 stars though because it does make my face feel dry and smells like the bad end of a tree if you know what I mean.</li>
            <li> Do not get it in your eyes though, it is not pleasant.</li>
            <li> and it is painful and SO difficult to clear.</li>
            <li> My struggle with acne has made me shy, self conscious, depressed, angry, and desperate.</li>
            <li> I use this at night by wetting my face a bit, then rubbing it in circles all over and rinsing it off with a thin washcloth.</li>
            <li> It hasn&#x27;t stopped my breakouts but it hasn&#x27;t made them worse, either.</li>
            <li> and my acne kept getting worse</li>
            <li> in fact, I feel like it&#x27;s making both skin conditions worse.</li>
            <li> She prescribed mirvaso ($90.00 cream) that hurt my face and made the condition worse.</li>
            <li> My face is still terribly broken out from this.</li>
            <li> Tea tree is irritating to some people&#x27;s skin.</li>
            <li> The safety seal was broken, but I used it anyway.</li>
            <li> Not a good idea to use while in the shower!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the combination of these products made my skin infinitely worse when I used them as directed.  </li>
            <li> And I&#x27;ve always used makeup with all of my face products and have never had a weird reaction until I tried this product.</li>
            <li> Are you bored with my \\&quot;tragic\\&quot; story?</li>
            <li> I have oily skin that just started randomly breaking out again.  </li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t terrible, but it definitely didn&#x27;t help my skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s useless</li>
            <li> This is one of the worst facial products I have ever tried.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I returned the product.</li>
            <li> expensive</li>
            <li> expensive</li>
            <li> I have oily skin with acne that isn&#x27;t crazy terrible, just enough to piss me off.</li>
            <li> Whatever this product has in it is horrible and bad for your skin, it&#x27;s not natural.</li>
            <li> I had previously been using a salicylic acid-based treatment which was horrible</li>
            <li> After being on pro-active for about 4 years, I needed a product that was not as expensive and that didn&#x27;t react bad to sun exposure.</li>
            <li> Then it went crazy again.</li>
            <li> I needed something that wasn&#x27;t so harsh that it needed to be scrubbed out to avoid horrible things.</li>
            <li> Disappointing</li>
            <li> , it was so bad my eye was swollen shut.  </li>
            <li> Then i found this its like a life saver i get acne really bad on my forehead</li>
            <li> I have never had a breakout this bad</li>
            <li> Maybe I just got a bad bottle</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s painful and ugly.</li>
            <li> but if you (like my daughter) are completely frustrated, give it a shot.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed (</li>
            <li> the Body Shop locations having been closing area DFW area. :(</li>
            <li> I must tell you, it was very disappointing.</li>
            <li> but I just couldn&#x27;t bring myself to use them because I hate putting stuff on my face that I don&#x27;t like the smell of.    </li>
            <li> I hate bashing products, but I did want to leave a review on this item, based on my experience of using this product.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> After spending six months on a terrible drug that dries out your body so badly that you can&#x27;t get anything waxed because it will rip your skin off and having joint problems because of it, my acne.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed</li>
            <li> useless!!!!!</li>
            <li> I am really disappointed with it!!!  </li>
            <li> This was worst than ever and lasted for over a month and showed no signs of going away.</li>
            <li> The smell is disgusting but thats not what matters, my skin is already clearing up within days with the help of my dermatologist creams overnight</li>
            <li> I have used everything from proactive, Clinique, to neutrogena products and still always got terrible breakouts.</li>
            <li> This is a TERRIBLE product!!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had horrible skin for over 10 years and have literally tried EVERYTHING.</li>
            <li> However, my skin reacted terribly.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> First of all, I shall stablish the fact that i have very greasy skin,&lt;br /&gt;Point being made, I really like this product, my skin feels really nice and soft, and it takes away the grease for quite a while during the day. Totally would buy again!!!</li>
            <li> Awesome facial wash. Takes away all dirt and reduces pimple size. I didn&#x27;t reduce redness but it leaves face fresh and un oily or dry. Make sure you use a great moisturizer with this ( I recommend CeraVe ) . The scent makes me wanna use every time</li>
            <li> Bought this for the hubby who has huge issues with oily skin. It works really well for him and the bottle lasts forever.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years. It&#x27;s great for my combination skin. Not drying, yet clears up acne. I also appreciate the fact that these products are not tested on innocent animals.</li>
            <li> If you are use to having acne breakouts, especially around your cycle, this face wash really helps to limit the break outs.  I suggest pairing up with a blemish stick by burts bees or desert essence.</li>
            <li> Pros: the face wash has a cooling effect on the skin, it is light enough for everyday use and doesn&#x27;t seem to strip my skin of too much oil&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: smell (some people may not like it...I don&#x27;t care for it, but it&#x27;s not a HUGE deal), tea tree oil is FAR DOWN on the ingredients list, and number of ingredients (too much unnecessary junk in it)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I liked this for the pros I listed, but when I read the ingredients list I was disappointed (my mistake for not reading the label online - but still a con). The further down the list of ingredients, the lower concentration of that particular ingredient. I will use the rest of this bottle, but I will not re-purchase. In terms of what it has done for my skin, I haven&#x27;t noticed a difference.</li>
            <li> Bought this face wash when it was on sell. I would get pimples especially around my period or whenever I get stressed out. It helps clear my pimples and prevent it -works fast too. The only problem is it gets my skin dry and the smell is awfully strong. Not a good idea to use while in the shower! But it does it&#x27;s job... I use their moisturizer which balances out the dryness. I would repurchase it again.&lt;br /&gt;I really appreciate that they supposedly do fair trade, help the environment, and against animal testing.</li>
            <li> I really like this face wash , smells pretty good , I wish it had little beads for easier makeup removal but I usually use Dove unscented before this.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used this for a few days in conjuntion with Tea tree toner , lotion and fade cream and seems to help with my cystic acne</li>
            <li> If I could give this product a no star I would. I have bought this product because of the reviews of how good it is. And let me just say this product ok at first starts to show results that it&#x27;s working which made me feel good about purchasing the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But then my oh my.&lt;br /&gt;Out of no where this product starting giving me like these itchy pimples on my face. You couldn&#x27;t even pop them! They were big and hideous. And I&#x27;ve always used makeup with all of my face products and have never had a weird reaction until I tried this product. I&#x27;m highly dissapointed in allll their products because I purchased the whole set and were a complete let down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t know how to get rid of those gross spots on my face other then let them heal and go away on their own. Whatever this product has in it is horrible and bad for your skin, it&#x27;s not natural. ALMOST ALL THE INGREDIENTS ARE CHEMICALS IVE NEVER HEARD OF??&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not going to put that stuff on my face, for my body to absorb it.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t recommend this product at all. Save your money, and face.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Both of my teenage daughters use this with great results.  Would recommend and buy again.</li>
            <li> I bought this product to help me with my scoris I have a slight break out on my forhead.After using this product for a few day it has began to Not bad at all for money.Its smells really good too.Update After using it for a few months I bought the whole line. Works really good.Worth the money</li>
            <li> It smells like mint. the effect is ok but I don&#x27;t like the fluid feature. it&#x27;s too watery for me.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t do much for my skin... love the smell.</li>
            <li> love this product, good price</li>
            <li> This stuff used to work wonders on my skin a year or two back, but they changed the ingredients and now it doesn&#x27;t work hardly at all. It&#x27;s very unfortunate, too, because after years of doctor/dermatologist visits, and over-the-counter medications, I had finally found something that all but completely cleared my skin. I really wish I could find some batches of the older face wash to buy in bulk... but oh well, on to trying to find something else... :\</li>
            <li> My 13 year old daughter has been using it for the past few weeks and is already seeing a difference with her acne.</li>
            <li> Worked pretty well at first. Then it just started really drying out my extremely oily skin and caused me to break out even more! Please save your money and buy something else because i have very oily skin and this made me breakout more than any product ive ever used and gave me horrible dry patches.</li>
            <li> Very effective and it feels good to use this on my face. It&#x27;s a good wash that keeps the pimples and the blackheads away.</li>
            <li> This works wonders on acne prone skin! The bottle is big, and you only need a pea size to cover the entire face so it will last me for quite some time. I love how it lathers and cleans my face up. I have seen a tremendous change on my skin ever since I started using it: it is less oily and I do not break out as much. Plus, the scent of the tea tree oil wakes me up. I have tried so many face washes from drug store to higher end ones and this is still my favorite one!!</li>
            <li> This face wash is a miracle for my skin. I have an oily and very sensitive skin. So i am very very choosy, demanding and cautious about selecting any product for my skin. I have been using this face wash for years now. It not only clears the skin but also helps prevent acne and black heads. After wash the skin feels soft n so clean. I am inLove with this face wash and would recommend to every girl who has slight oily skin. It does wonders.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. It doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I really love this facial wash!! I originally started using it because I&#x27;m pregnant and this facial wash is safe for your skin to use while pregnant as it doesn&#x27;t have the sacyllic acid or benzoyl peroxide in it, which can be toxic to your baby as its absorbed by your skin and into your blood stream. At first I would wash my face with this two to three times a day and I was continuing to break out, I thought it was just because of the hormones from being pregnant but then I started using it once a day, only in the evening before I went to bed to get all the dirt and oil off my skin. I started noticing a huge improvement!! This facial wash can dry your skin out, or at least strip your skin of all the natural oils. Using more than once a day will result in your skin producing extra oils, which in turn makes you break out. You shouldnt need to wash your face more than once a day &amp; even so I would recommend using a really good facial moisturizer to keep your skin from producing those extra oils. Once a day, at night before bed, and this facial wash will keep all that stubborn acne away. Now don&#x27;t expect a miracle, if your hormones are crazy, your young, pregnant or its that time of the month for the ladies, whatever reason, you will have light break outs from time to time. This does help clear the breakouts and keep them at bay. I also add a little pure tea tree oil to the bottle as i really love tea tree oil and all its benefits!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to get emotional while writing this review because that&#x27;s how amazing this product is. I&#x27;m 22 and have struggled with acne since before I even hit puberty at age 9 or 10 (why? No dermatologist could ever say, or ever recommend anything that worked). I have tried EVERYTHING. When I say everything, I mean it. Ev.ry.thing. My struggle with acne has made me shy, self conscious, depressed, angry, and desperate. I&#x27;m lucky enough that my acne is not as severe as it was when I was younger, but it is still moderate at all times. Not anymore. I tried every over the counter face wash, everything the dermatologist recommended, going on myocycline, sprionolactone, and even spending six months on a high dose of accutane (which, if you haven&#x27;t heard of it, causes crazy birth defects if you get pregnant while using it and can cause depression, and in my case made mine worse, and can also mess with your cholesterol pretty badly). I went on accutane when I was 16 (six years ago) and for a few months after the course, my skin was alright. Not perfect, but better. Then it went crazy again. After spending six months on a terrible drug that dries out your body so badly that you can&#x27;t get anything waxed because it will rip your skin off and having joint problems because of it, my acne. Came. Back. I wasn&#x27;t about to go back on it, so I floated around from product to product for the next few years.    Are you bored with my \\&quot;tragic\\&quot; story? Good. Because here&#x27;s the happy ending. The Body Shop Tea Tree Skin Clearing Facial Wash. I got this four days ago and can already see results. I was using tea tree oil as a spot treatment with okay results, so I decided to try this wash. I was just about desperate enough to go back on accutane (it&#x27;s really hard looking for jobs and being confident on interviews right out of college when your skin is blotchy and blemished) but I decided to try one more time. I woke up yesterday morning and was in such a fantastic mood because my skin looked BEAUTIFUL (or at least relatively so). I had NO new pimples. I cannot remember the last time I woke up with no new blemishes to ruin my day. I was on cloud 9. I even have a cyst on my chin that it&#x27;s reducing very quickly, and I normally have to get shots of cortizone to make them go away. I&#x27;m not super prone to cystic acne, but occasionally I get it and it&#x27;s painful and ugly. No OTC products can do anything about them, but this is somehow doing the trick.    I know I&#x27;ve only been using this for a few days so if my results change I&#x27;ll update the review, but words cannot express how happy I have been since I started using this. It sounds silly, but I really am. I kind of want to kiss whoever invented this.    If you&#x27;re on the fence about this product, BUY IT. It&#x27;s incredible. It smells wonderful (though if you&#x27;ve smelled tea tree oil before and don&#x27;t like the smell, you won&#x27;t like this) which makes using it so much better. I&#x27;ve had other natural facial remedies that were semi-effective but I just couldn&#x27;t bring myself to use them because I hate putting stuff on my face that I don&#x27;t like the smell of.    I use this at night by wetting my face a bit, then rubbing it in circles all over and rinsing it off with a thin washcloth. After that I use Alba Botanica&#x27;s daily moisturizing cream.    Body Shop, if you need a testimonial, contact me. Your product is amazing and I have nothing but positive things to say. I&#x27;m going to slowly acquire the entire tea tree line. Thank you for making a whole set of products with such a natural, wonderful oil!    Update (original review on 1/6/15, update today 3/1/15)  This product is still giving amazing results. My scars are fading, I have had fewer breakouts than ever, and am so happy with my results. I have since added some more Body Shop products to my regimen. I start with plain coconut oil as makeup remover. Then, I use this cleanser to wash my face. I follow it up with [[ASIN:B002K8MK0I The Body Shop Tea Tree Skin Clearing Toner, 8.4-FluidOunce]] , then use [[ASIN:B002K8UB9A The Body Shop Tea Tree Skin Clearing Lotion, 1.69 Fluid Ounces]] as well as a tiny bit of [[ASIN:B004O3BTKO The Body Shop Tea Tree Blemish Fade Night Lotion, 1.0 Fluid Ounces]] , and finish with a homemade mixture of coconut oil and [[ASIN:B0019LVG52 NOW Foods Lavender &amp; Tea Tree Oil, 1 ounce]]. I put the coconut, lavender, and tea tree oil mixture on any breakouts or inflamed areas, but not all over my face. It&#x27;s kind of an extensive regimen, but it works better than anything I&#x27;ve ever tried. I am wearing less concealer, foundation, and powder than I ever have. My skin is less red, I have fewer breakouts, and fewer scars. I&#x27;m so much more comfortable with my skin and I owe it all to tea tree oil.</li>
            <li> This face wash will make your skin tingle as you use it, and it will feel free afterward. I couldn&#x27;t get past the fact that it actually smells like a bathroom cleaning product though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wouldn&#x27;t purchase again.</li>
            <li> Takes time but has great results.</li>
            <li> great still use it to this day.</li>
            <li> I have to admit this facial wash smells terrible, but it seems to be working really well. I have only been using it for a little over a week, and my complexion is already more clear.</li>
            <li> Not quite sure how to put this, but I&#x27;ve been using this face wash for over a week now with no new breakouts. That is pretty amazing, although I will not venture into saying that it&#x27;s cured my acne just yet. I&#x27;m also using other face washes (2% salicylic acid, 10% benzoyl peroxide), so maybe it&#x27;s the combination of Teatree and the other face washes that is stopping the breakouts. I might write an update a few weeks from now to follow up.</li>
            <li> Once you get use to smell, works great without drying. Has eally reduced my acne.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re used to the product that would be directly purchased from The Body Shop, you will be greatly disappointed. I&#x27;ve been using it for over a year, &amp; it&#x27;s a grand product!! BUT.... the one I ordered two days ago &amp; received today is NOT the same facial cleanser. The scent is non-existent, whereas with the original, the tea tree oil is obviously present. The viscosity is off too: the original is much thicker than this green water I received. Pay the extra $1 on the manufacturer&#x27;s website &amp; get it through them!! This stuff isn&#x27;t touching my face!!</li>
            <li> This a good product....But, only for young skin, this did nothing to please my older skin.  But still a good product.</li>
            <li> I use to purchase from time to time.&lt;br /&gt;Use&#x27;ll continue to purchase.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you good product.</li>
            <li> This is alright as an everday light wash, and does its job alright. My skin is also very dry, so I use the Tea Tree exfoliant every other day, and Vitamin E moisturizers. My skin looks and feels amazing with this routine.</li>
            <li> Always come back to this product! I know that it has sulfate in working as the soap and some people try to avoid that chemical. After finding out, I tried other products but found out that my skin works the best with this product. It gives a clean feeling! My blemishes has gone down alot!  (I also use acv and tell tree oil in it as my toner)</li>
            <li> The scent is so refreshing!</li>
            <li> The only face wash I use! I&#x27;m 34 and get breakouts (thanks, stress), but this product is so consistent for me. I use this with the Olay facial brush and have great results. Doesn&#x27;t overdry like other acne washes</li>
            <li> This face wash is may be good for some people....I was told its good for oily skin but not for normal skin...I still purchased this from the body shop and I returned the product because it made my skin very dry. If you have normal skin, you may get dry skin...also this face wash is not organic or 100 percent natural...This product has Sodium Laureth Sulfate so I would not use it...if you don&#x27;t mind using synthetic chemicals on your face such as SLS, this product might work for you...I would rather spend more money and get better product.</li>
            <li> Listen, if you want a great tea tree face wash, desert essence is the way to go. I went with this because of the extraordinary body shop tea tree astringent. It&#x27;s amazing. But this wash seems like designer hand soap. It doesn&#x27;t leave my face gleaming, but it&#x27;s not a complete disappointment.</li>
            <li> I ordered this by accident, while trying to buy their toner -- which is also an excellent product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually use neutrogena deep clean, but I feel like this stuff might clean and fight oily skin a bit better.  I&#x27;m not sure if its worth the double the neutrogena price, but I&#x27;ll enjoy this bottle and reevaluate when it&#x27;s empty</li>
            <li> Seems to work well! I scrub it in thoroughly and rinse. I do believe the tea tree oil is helping my skin condition to clear.</li>
            <li> This cleanser is great. I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple of weeks now along with the toner and I absolutely Love it and the way it makes my skin feel. I&#x27;ve tries several different products over the years but have found the one I won&#x27;t change from.</li>
            <li> Although i used this product and found it to be better than the other acne facial cleansers i have used i found the Neutrogena Rapid Clear Foaming Scrub to be much better at clearing my skin. I found a slight increase of breakouts when using this product. Despite this The Body Shop&#x27;s Body wash when used with a shower puff or scrub seemed to rapidly decrease pimple size and multitude after just 2 washes.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about ten years and I still love it.  It&#x27;s got kind of a pine tree smell to it but the scent doesn&#x27;t linger.  It makes your skin tingle when you use it.  It works well on it&#x27;s own but I find that it doesn&#x27;t hurt to use a facial scrub (I recommend Biore&#x27;s Pore Unclogging Scrub or The Body Shop&#x27;s Tea Tree Oil facial scrub) every now and then as well as the tea tree oil toner, also by The Body Shop, to make sure that your skin is completely clean.  If you find that the product is drying, just use a very light, water-based moisturizer and you&#x27;ll be receiving compliments on your complexion in no time.  I don&#x27;t wear cover-up makeup at all, I find my skin is just radiant on its own and I love it.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of redness and blemishes, was very skeptical about this product as nothing has ever really worked for me. This face wash is like magic. Redness and blemishes are visibly reduced immediately after using. I&#x27;ve been using this for a little over a month and don&#x27;t know how I ever lived without it.</li>
            <li> Has helped my rosaeca a LOT!</li>
            <li> I just wanted something to clear my blackheads, I dont really have acne prone skin unless I forget to wash my face. But I have always, always, always, had blackheads on my chin and nose. Stubborn and deep blackheads and also large, clogged pores. Ugh. I have researched that tea tree oil is an anti bacterial agent which helps fight blackheads, but after using this product for a month now I have not seen any improvements.  So, if you are like me and are looking for a product to clear blackheads then l would not recommend this. But if anyone has a suggestion please help a girl out!!!</li>
            <li> I have been using this for several years on my face.  Even though, I am way past being a teenager, I was still getting occasional bumps and pimples.  This tea tree skin cleanser really helps to keep my face clear of blemishes.  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> When I first started using this product, I was HOOKED. I went out and bought 7 other products from the tea tree line AND told my friends to go out and buy some too, which they did. Well, it&#x27;s been a few months now and the feeling I once had for it has slowly gone away. I loved what it did for my blackheads, in which I&#x27;ve been struggling with for years. It DRASTICALLY shrank the size of my blackheads and I loved it. Well, now it doesn&#x27;t work so well. After a while of using it, I started getting extremely sensitive around my nose area, it would get SUPER itchy and flaky and uncomfortable and it&#x27;d be bright red, though this problem was fixed with applying some moisturizer after use. Well after a while after that even, it started breaking me out until eventually I just had to start using an entirely different brand completely. I must tell you, it was very disappointing.</li>
            <li> Awesome product face feels and looks very clear</li>
            <li> Very good facial cleanser</li>
            <li> I bought it the day before yesterday, and it was arrived today afternoon.&lt;br /&gt;I used it before I went to bed. It&#x27;s good for my oil skin and acne. And it smells so good and natural!! I am not sure if there are mint in it, because my skin felt really fresh after using it.&lt;br /&gt;I like it very much. And maybe I will buy again.</li>
            <li> This is the best face wash after using so many face washes. You can actually feel and sense the tea-tree essence. Worth every penny. For some reason Cetaphil doesn&#x27;t work for me, so I am now back to Body Shop&#x27;s Tea Tree face wash. Go for it! All purpose!</li>
            <li> This has the nice refreshing tea-tree feel and fragrance, feels like its cleaning your face and freshening the mind as you wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the shape of the bottle makes it seem like there is less product... it last longer than you would expect.</li>
            <li> I do like this face wash... it lathers well and cleans well. I have an issues with pores on my nose so I got this based on the reviews I have read. But it doesn&#x27;t help as much as I had anticipated.</li>
            <li> Best wash for acne! Not wonderful for makeup but defiantly great to use after my regular wash</li>
            <li> like this product and when I use it daily it keeps my skin from breaking out</li>
            <li> Love this face wash - have used it for almost 20 years.</li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s the real scoop on this product - you can use really harsh chemicals like ProActive (or other acid based acne cures) but you will not be doing yourself any favors.  Tea Tree is nature&#x27;s salicylic acid - and it works.  Like anything else, repeated use is critical.  You need to wash in the morning and before bed and make sure that you use the moisturizer after.  Acne happens because the body over produces sebum (oil) and so when you are overly dry and do not moisturize, your face will break out.  It seems counterintuitive to use moisturizer on an oily face, but that&#x27;s exactly what you have to do which is why there are a couple other tea tree moisturizers by The Body Shop to choose from.  Curing a long term outbreak requires repeated and consistent use.  Some of the best results you can imagine without the long term consequences of harsh acid-based products.</li>
            <li> Really nice product! Does a great job of cleansing and leaves my skin feeling clean and refreshed.</li>
            <li> I think this product is drying out my skin, though i have been outdoors a lot.</li>
            <li> About 2 or so years ago I have a staph infection on my face, it was so bad my eye was swollen shut.  The hospital did a CT because they were worried about the infection getting into my eye and other areas and doing permanent damage.  I got it cleared up and about 6 weeks later I had another one in a different area of my face.  I had a total of 4 staph infections in less than 6 months and they couldn&#x27;t seem to stop them.  I did some internet research and learned that Tea Tree Oil is a good for stopping infections.  I bought this face soap and have not had another incident.  Besides no staph I do not have any adult acne breakouts or problems.  My skin is so smooth and blemish free that I no longer wear foundation on a daily basis.  This stuff is great and I highly recommend it!!</li>
            <li> I have used Tea Tree wash for over 10 years. Love how clean and refreshed my skin feels after each wash.</li>
            <li> Love this face wash! It gets the job done, right, every time. I use this and the foaming tea tree facial cleanser every day, and my face is 99% clear 99% of the time. (I&#x27;m a girl...you know what that means!)</li>
            <li> I like this product. I do like what tea tree does to my skin. It is a great face wash and I actually use it even to remove my make up. Do not get it in your eyes though, it is not pleasant. It doesn&#x27;t leave my face dry nor moisturized after washing it but it leaves it clean and for moisturizing I have a moisturizer so that is not a problem. It does leave my skin breakout free which is what is most important to me. I will buy again.</li>
            <li> Effective in helping to keep my skin clear</li>
            <li> My face, at first, couldn&#x27;t take how strong the tea tree was and the acne got worse.  Once I used just a little for a week then built up, it was much better.  Very nice cleanser.</li>
            <li> Love the way this makes my skin feel! It is cruelty free and that makes me VERY happy. I am so glad I found it. My skin is so soft and tingly when I use it.</li>
            <li> I have oily skin that just started randomly breaking out again.  This line has helped so much.  I use the body wash for any body breakouts.  I love that the face wash and the rest of the line has done away with my breakouts and evened my skin tone out so quickly.</li>
            <li> I was looking for something to help with getting rid of blackheads and other small blemishes.  The Tea Tree Skin Clearing Facial Wash has done the trick.  I will be ordering this product on a regular basis.</li>
            <li> Eh, I wish I could give this stuff a great review, but it did nothing for my skin. My skin is combo/oily, and it tends to go crazy in the summertime, so I was hoping the tea tree oil would clear up breakouts and get rid of the excess oil. It wasn&#x27;t terrible, but it definitely didn&#x27;t help my skin. After using it consistently for 6 weeks I switched back to using a La Roche Posay cleanser, and my skin immediately started to look and feel better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a long time user of the Tea Tree items at The Body Shop. This product is great when combined with a facial puff. I also have dry skin and this does not irritate or over dry.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a while before ordering it via Amazon and I have to say I am very pleased with the price it is listed for on here. As far as the product itsself I have never been so satisfied with a face/body wash for oily/acneic skin types. My skin always feels fresh and not over-dried as opposed to most oil control products. However, if you are wishing to use it right away the shipping does take a bit so I would suggest upgrading it if possible.</li>
            <li> This cleanser is great. Doesnt dry my skin out too much, Controls oil and shine, doesn&#x27;t induce acne and i think it may be helping my complexion a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you to everyone at The Body Shop (: i love this stuff!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m ready to buy the second bottle.&lt;br /&gt;I just wish it keeps my face from oil longer cos I have a lot of oil.&lt;br /&gt;Maximum 2 times/day only.</li>
            <li> I have had acne my whole life and in my 30s now. I&#x27;ve been using products with benzoyl peroxide but wanted to try something more natural. I really wanted this to work but it dried my skin and caused little red bumps and basically acne got worse. I was using the tea tree cleanser , toner and spot treatment. I tried it for a few weeks and couldn&#x27;t handle it. I have read that some people may have allergic reactions so that may be what happened to me.  I had to go back to my old products. I did switch to a more sensitive formula(AcneFree products works well for me) but it still has benzoyl peroxide which seems to work the best to keep my acne at bay. I worry about longterm use of BP and will keep searching for natural alternatives.</li>
            <li> I like the fresh cooling feeling</li>
            <li> If you have oily or problem skin, definitely give this atleast a try. Its a really good quality product with oodles of tea tree oil in it. You can actually feel the freshness on your skin. Has helped clear my face in a month&#x27;s use. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I bought this a few days ago. After using it only three times I am already obsessed. I just had a baby a couple months ago and due to lovely hormones my face was breaking out. After using this only one time at night (along with the tea tree toner and tea tree lotion) I noticed that in the morning my skin looked significantly better. I also think it smells amazing and feels great on my skin. It has a nice, mild tingle. I feel so refreshed after using it. I used it with my Clarisonic and I only use it at night so my face doesn&#x27;t get too dried out or irritated. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s too expensive because it&#x27;s a pretty good sized bottle. I think people tend to use too much face wash. You only need a tiny amount and if you only use it once a day this bottle will last a long time. It is so worth the price. I will definitely buy this again.</li>
            <li> This product is meant for oily skin, i wish i would have known that before I bought this. The scent is strong ! It breaks me out and dries out my skin.</li>
            <li> Okay...but not worth the money...</li>
            <li> I like Tea Tree and this stuff kept my face refreshed after each use in the morning. It also smelled great and last you quite a while before you run out to the store and get another one. It doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin depending on the type of skin condition that you have. I believe this was for combination to oily skin.</li>
            <li> Have been using this face wash for years and its the best. Feels really fresh every time I use it.</li>
            <li> I like this product for my oily skin.  I feel refreshed every time I use this on my face; no complaints.</li>
            <li> I like tea tree oil as its natural and its supposed to be great for acne prone skin. I don&#x27;t know if this is an all natural organic product, but it appears to work quite well. I was using another self claimed organic product a while back, but then again, we really never know when it comes to products. Bottom line is that this does seem to do the job. It hasn&#x27;t stopped my breakouts but it hasn&#x27;t made them worse, either.</li>
            <li> My 13  year old uses this regularly and it has GREATLY cleared up her skin. She uses it twice a day and swears by it.</li>
            <li> Excellent results without being too harsh. Excellent for stress based eczema, ring worm, or anyone with oily skin. It gets rid of black heads too. If you let it sit a little you can feel it working. Anything tea tree oil is good but some products can be harsh. I really like this product a lot.</li>
            <li> I began using this right after I developed a skin allergy due to SLS. I stopped using soaps and shampoos with it, but because I thought this was a natural product I still used it. My face broke out, and continued to break out. I had bumps under my skin. They weren&#x27;t exactly pimples, red, or itchy. It was annoying and it never got better. The light bulb went off, and I checked the ingredients and sure enough, SLS was in it. I stopped using it, and after a few weeks, I looked semi-normal again. I had high hopes for this product, but no luck!</li>
            <li> I tried Most Tea Tree cleansers but this is the best i can get,&lt;br /&gt;If your face shine so this is the right product&lt;br /&gt;If you have acne so this is the right product&lt;br /&gt;If you can&#x27;t control your sebum oil so this is incredible for over sebum oil&lt;br /&gt;if you are looking for fresh sensation so trust me and go ahead&lt;br /&gt;if you r looking for shrinking pores so go ahead&lt;br /&gt;Most of tea tree cleansers is very watery i don&#x27;t know why, and the watery cleansers is not practical at all but this one is not</li>
            <li> I use the entire line of The Body Shop Tea Tree products, this the oil, the toner, the scrub, the lotion, and the mask. They are all AMAZING. I suffered from hormonal acne, black heads and the occasional pimple. This is the only product that has ever left me feeling confident enough to go MAKEUP FREE I&#x27;m on week four of no make up and on my third week of using this product. I&#x27;ve never felt more confident in my own skin.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I have rosacea and it doesn&#x27;t irate my skin. It helps to clear and control ay outbreaks I may experience.</li>
            <li> I actually went to the Body Shop store in Bay Street and bought the travel size, just to give it a try. I just washed with it for the first time and I have to say it&#x27;s quite amazing. The smell is a bit aromatic, but nothing pungent. What really inspired me to write was the minty, menthol-like feeling I had while washing my face. While washing, I actually left it on for half a minute to see how well it absorbed. Normally, foaming and chemical-laden cleanser make my skin feel dry when I leave it on, but my skin felt great. It could tell something good was being done. Afterwards, I couldn&#x27;t believe how soft my skin felt. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever tried a cleanser that softens skin before. I&#x27;m definitely going to look into the Body Shop&#x27;s other products in the Tea Tree collection.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my son along with the toner &amp; moisturizer lotion. He has been using all three products for about two weeks &amp; we are definitely seeing a change in his acne for the better.</li>
            <li> Turned out my face very dry and itchy</li>
            <li> Excellent !  My skin feels amazing!</li>
            <li> I began using this face wash when I had broken out pretty badly on my forehead. I had tried so many different products to get rid of the acne but nothing had worked. I combined the tea tree face wash with my new clairsonic and within weeks the zits diminished drastically. I&#x27;m on my third bottle and have been acne free since!</li>
            <li> I am using body shop tea tree product line for more than a year. I tried switching to other brands with same ingredients but they dint give as good results as Body shop  !&lt;br /&gt;This face wash comes in the foaming form as well but i like this one better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this everyday twice and I am very satisfied with the results.</li>
            <li> Works great and smells good too!</li>
            <li> This cleanser has a great consistency for use with a Clarisonic, but I don&#x27;t feel that it does anything special. Also, if you are sensitive to strong scents, maybe steer clear of this because it has a very odd smell. This is a generous size for the price though! I gave this three stars because its not bad, just not great.</li>
            <li> Been using this for almost two weeks maybe around every other day. It seems to reduce redness, prevent breakouts and lessen current problem areas. It&#x27;s not *too* drying, but I wouldn&#x27;t use it every day unless you have oily skin. Good for normal/combination/oily faces. The scent is nice, but doesn&#x27;t linger.</li>
            <li> I have been using the body shop tea tree system (face wash, toner, moisturizer) and unless you use some other kind of moisturizer (I use a vitamin e coconut oil) it will dry out your skin. But it true does work wonders when you balance it with something else!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years now, When I apply it, it feels minty and my face looks a lot clearer afterwards. Simple and plain: product does what it needs to do, which is cleansing my face. It is rather thorough though and I can imagine if you have a sensitive skin, this product may dry your skin out. So be careful with that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, although the product decreases my acne significantly, it doesn&#x27;t completely PREVENT is from appearing on my skin. So it basically works, but it is no wonder product.</li>
            <li> I am a big fan of tree tree oil. This facial wash smelled great and help clear up my blemishes. I also love that the body shop does no animal testing.</li>
            <li> It was suggested to me by a couple people but it was average in my opinion. Won&#x27;t repurchase myself but acne washes kind of depend on the person using them.</li>
            <li> I have had acne since i was a teenager. Needless to say, at 25 i have tried so many products and systems, toners, you name it! I actually came across this product by accident. I had a coupon for $3 off any body shop product and my store just so happens to carry smaller bottles that are about $3.25, making them only .25 for me :) little did i know, this coupon experience was going to change my face for ever! For combination, acne prone skin, this is the only thing that has worked for me, ever! it does leave your skin feeling tight, but doesnt dry it out to where your skin is over-producing oils. it leaves enough dryness for your moisturizer to be just enough.</li>
            <li> Sometimes these Tea Tree is a little hyped. I love the smell to this product, however, if your skin dries up very easily, this product will dry you up. I recommend trying something less drying or use some kind of moisturizer or lotion.</li>
            <li> Works just as described, leaving your face feeling smooth and not oily without being dried out. Has a pleasant aroma and seems like it will last a while.</li>
            <li> Bought this item because I love Tea Tree and product stated it was good for blemish skin. I have been very happy with the daily use of the Tea Tree Skin Clearing Wash and have notice a change in my face skin condition. It is more clear and brighter in appearance and the blemishes are less. Very happy with this product that I have order the Toner and Lotion too.</li>
            <li> In the winter or extreme heat of summer, it is even harder to keep my sensitive skin from cracking. Greasy products make it break out. Tea tree oil is nice and refreshing, but not drying. I just wish The Body Shop had a better cap. It tends to chip and be hard to close after a few uses. A pump or inverted bottle might work better.</li>
            <li> This stuff is my favorite face wash. Arrived on time and it was just as perfect as buying it from the store!</li>
            <li> I have only used this product two or three times now, but I really love it.  Obviously, it has not gotten rid of all my acne over night (nothing can really do that), but it feels wonderful on my skin and it really appears to clean up my pours very nicely.  The product has a pleasant and natural smell, and my skin feels wonderful while using it.  I will continue to see how this goes, but I expect I will probably buy this product again!</li>
            <li> Everyone is different one of my friends used this product for 1 1/2 month- 3 months and face is very clear from black pore and acne, i like FAST result which you have to be patient and keep using it to see results... GREAT feels good try it!!!!!</li>
            <li> Your face feels clean and not tight like so many cleansers make the skin feel. This is a good make up remover also.</li>
            <li> My face has actually gotten much better after using this!! It smells nice! I just love it!</li>
            <li> Really like this face wash. I don&#x27;t see any acne going away but I will continue using it and hope it really works.</li>
            <li> It has a very strong smell, but served the purpose for my teenage step-daughter&#x27;s acne issues.  Highly recommended for acne or oily skin.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It is probably one of the best face cleaning products I have ever used. I will definitely purchase this a gain.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I had to stop useing it due to a rash that developed  after about 5 days.</li>
            <li> I can honestly say that this product is good for treating and preventing breakouts. I actually bought the kit from Ulta. The kit included the facial wash, lotion, spot treatment, and the mask.The toner is very refreshing and picks up whatever is left from the wash. I have combination/oily skin. For me, it can leave my skin a bit dry so I do moisturize a few minutes after using the lotion. I also would like to add that this wash doesn&#x27;t lather that well during the first use, I usually have to work at it to get the lather I want. Other than that, I enjoy the line. It has really helped me with my skin issues.</li>
            <li> I recently bought this product directly from the body shop in lenox mall. I was told it would work best and i know the wonders of tea tree oil. I gave this face wash 3 weeks and my acne kept getting worse and i gave it more time to clear my face up and after using for 4 to 5 weeks my acne just got worse!!!! It was better before i used this product. My skin type is very oily(around the nose and under my eyes) and I must admit it did dry up the oily parts of my face with the toner and wash but my face produced way more acne in places I never really got acne such as my forehead. As I&#x27;m typing this right now acne is all across my forehead . I did investigate that if your looking for a very good facial wash to take acne away and prevent would be products with benzoyl peroxide and salicylic acid. These ingredients are known as the products that work directly with your acne. The body shop tea tree skin clearing facial wash has not a single trace of benzoyl peroxide or salicylic acid. The only benefit of this wash is the magnificent smell of tea tree and the tingly feeling that i loved but a good smell doesn&#x27;t take away these dang white heads. I paid a few bucks for my toner and facial wash and it sad i wasted money on something that really doesn&#x27;t work with my skin type. Good luck on finding a fash wash.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy the way this product smells. I have always been a fan of tea tree oil products. I think it helps well with keeping my acne down. After i wash my face it feels refreshed and clean.</li>
            <li> Love the soap, it does leave a strong Tea Tree scent after using, so make sure you like that smell.</li>
            <li> Way too harsh for my sensitive skin-In addition to drying out my skin, it broke me out pretty bad. Probably be best for someone with oil skin.</li>
            <li> Purchase to aid in cleansing my eyelids as I have Blephartiis. Used for lid not enside the eye, in my case did not work</li>
            <li> My skin has improved significantly since I started using this daily. I had a lot of problems with large, painful chin acne after I had my son, and now it has almost completely disappeared.</li>
            <li> It´s a little bit strong for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> This helped clear up a lot of the redness and pimple looking places that the ingrown hairs had been and helped clear them up.</li>
            <li> Works great for cleaning skin without causing breakouts.</li>
            <li> Found this is the best face cleanser</li>
            <li> I like it though I&#x27;m not sure it has improved my skin. Still, a great buy and probably works well for people with normal skin.</li>
            <li> Ok so I was a little skeptical buying this product at first because literally every other product I have tried had not been successful. I have oily skin and I have tried soo many different products and home remedies for my skin that didn&#x27;t work. Well after using this product LITERALLY the next day there was a difference in my skin!!! It is drying but that&#x27;s what I needed. I use a little in the morning in the shower and then wash my face with it before I go to bed. My skin is basically clear from pimples now but now I need a product for my scars! AMAZING PRODUCT MUST BUY</li>
            <li> I keep reordering because its very good for acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> Best face wash got rid of my acne breakouts. Give your face a fresh and clean feel.  Would recommend for anyone with or without acne breakouts.</li>
            <li> As somebody who suffers from chronic acne, I&#x27;m always in the lookout for a great facial wash. After hearing great things about tea tree oil, I decided to give this a try. The face wash works just like a charm and leaves my face feeling refreshed and clean afterwards. After a few months of using these product, I&#x27;m starting to notice the positive benefits that it has had on my acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended to anyone suffering from acne or simply looking for a great face wash!</li>
            <li> I use this as the last thing to clean my face, neck, chest, shoulders, and anywhere else I&#x27;m prone to acne or blemishes. And I&#x27;m a fairly manly guy saying this. My skin looks a lot better after using this consistently.</li>
            <li> I love this facewash. As a 24-year-old guy, I never used a facewash of any kind (I would just scrub in the shampoo running out of my hair i guess).  but this product changed that for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LOVE the smell. Something about it is very therapeutic. when I use this, I usually let sit on my face for a bit just to enjoy the smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the effectiveness, I cant say. This is the only facewash I have used and it gets the job done as good as anything else. All i know is i used to think facewash was pointless and now im ordering this stuff on amazon because of how much I liked it. 5 stars.</li>
            <li> The smell is not very good.</li>
            <li> great at eliminating my blackheads!!!</li>
            <li> I wash my face with a spritz bottle full of distilled water. I needed something that wasn&#x27;t so harsh that it needed to be scrubbed out to avoid horrible things. This does the job and helps my acne as well (I think. Idk. Does it? I use so many new things at once I just can&#x27;t tell anymore -.-). Has a cooling effect which is nice I guess?? Makes me feel like it isn&#x27;t getting into my pores which I know isn&#x27;t true but it&#x27;s a mental thing okay. Smells fine. Never used anything with tea tree oil but it smells fine idk. Whoop.</li>
            <li> I had minor breakouts and was hoping that this would help.  After using this face wash along with the toner and moisturizer I am breaking out like I never had before.  This has made my skin noticeably oily and I keep breaking out.  I am very disappointed , I had high hopes for this product.</li>
            <li> Great item. Husband has to use for his face wash.</li>
            <li> Despite being a man in my mid 40s, the combination of this with a daily witch hazel application has begun garnering me compliment after compliment that I look younger and healthier.  Who knew!</li>
            <li> useless!!!!! I am really disappointed with it!!!  I thought Body Shop was good cuz it&#x27;s famous but no... It&#x27;s useless</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the real deal, I&#x27;ve been using this product for years but moved to an area where there&#x27;s not a Body Shop in convenient distance. Lower price on here than their site, so I bought.&lt;br /&gt;It is the actual product (flawed design in the cap and all, the cap is brittle and shatters itself asunder, something that happens every time I buy it from the store) the smell of the product changes over time and it does reduce (evaporate?) if you don&#x27;t close it&#x27;s cap tightly. this is also another way I know it&#x27;s the real thing.</li>
            <li> works great for my skin.</li>
            <li> Has a very minty smell, but I can feel it cleansing my skin!</li>
            <li> Definitely helps clear pores and a little goes a long way.  Now that the winter air is here, it&#x27;s a little drying but a light moisturizer is all you need.</li>
            <li> This product is great. My husband and i got this,the scrub and mask. My face always feels fresh and clean. Love it!</li>
            <li> I am 26 and got my first break out of adult acne. I have never had bad skin and if i ever broke out it was during that time of month and only lasted a couple of days. This was worst than ever and lasted for over a month and showed no signs of going away. I tried this product along with the lotion and within 2 wks my skin has cleared up dramatically. I am so pleased with this product!!!!</li>
            <li> I really like the scent but it threw me off a little that there was no lather or bubbles.</li>
            <li> So far so good. My skin is prone to breakouts but haven&#x27;t had any with this.&lt;br /&gt;Washed off easy.</li>
            <li> I hate bashing products, but I did want to leave a review on this item, based on my experience of using this product.&lt;br /&gt;I used this for quite some time, and firstly the smell was extremely strong and not to pleasing. The product itself, kind of irritated my skin in a way that it gave it that burning sensation, but definitely not in a good way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t really see any noticeable differences on my face after using this product for quite some time. I wasn&#x27;t to pleased with it, and it irritated my skin pretty badly.&lt;br /&gt;Of course everyone&#x27;s skin works differently, so this might work for others. However, for me it wasn&#x27;t the best choice.&lt;br /&gt;I hope this helped...</li>
            <li> This is all I ever use!</li>
            <li> Did not help my skin. Someone recommended this to me to wash my face. I would say no benefit to any other cleanser I have used maybe worse. My face has been breaking out like crazy this may actually be the reason. Because nothing else has changed. I love most tea tree products this is not one I would buy again or recommend.</li>
            <li> My non-oily face turbed into a super oily one, probably due to hormones. I decided to try this out and after the first night&#x27;s use i could see that my face was way less oily! I use the wash twice a day and the toner in the morning with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My face has been less oily and that has reduced my breakouts to practically none. Would recommend.</li>
            <li> This product has cleared up my skin and smells awesome. Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this product. I have been using it for about 3-4 years, and it has become an integral part of my cleansing routing.</li>
            <li> So heres my story: ive had acne prone skin since my middle school years, and just within the last year it turned into the condition called cystic acne and it is painful and SO difficult to clear. I have literally tried every single over the counter wash with little or no results, so I turned to natural solutions. I just recently discovered the body shop and their tea tree oil. I decided, why not. And let me tell you it is amazing, the first time I put it on I fell in love!! The smell is disgusting but thats not what matters, my skin is already clearing up within days with the help of my dermatologist creams overnight and im so happy with this product!! I recommend completely!!!</li>
            <li> After being on pro-active for about 4 years, I needed a product that was not as expensive and that didn&#x27;t react bad to sun exposure. I bought the Tea Tree Oil Face Wash, Cleanser and Lotion. At first, I was freaking out because for the first time in years I was getting huge pimples on my face that were taking forever to go away. After my third week of using all three Tea Tree Oil products, my face has never looked better! My pores have gotten smaller, my face is smoother, and my over-all skin tone just looks way healthier. I have very sensitive skin, and it does not dry it out in the least, I think because I use the lotion, it keeps my face moisturized. If you find your face is a bit dry and you use the Tea Tree Oil lotion, I recommend using regularly Aveeno Body Lotion on your face, works every time for me without clogging my pores. I would highly recommend the Tea Tree Oil wash from the Body Shop!! And honestly the price for all three products is extremely reasonable for how well it works and it&#x27;s a more natural wash.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think that it is any different than the generic stuff you can buy at the store. I wouldn&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> I use it every morning and night.. the first time I used it, it smelled kinda funky.. but feels like a tingly sensation on your face so to me it means its working.. My face feels and look much better!</li>
            <li> Helped me reduce shine, which is something none of the Neutrogena face washes did for me!</li>
            <li> I used to love The Body Shop&#x27;s tea tree products, but this one is not working for me. I have adult acne and rosacea and it&#x27;s not helping either of them - in fact, I feel like it&#x27;s making both skin conditions worse. I&#x27;m going to keep it around and try again on just my &amp;#34;T-zone,&amp;#34; keeping it off of my cheeks, where the rosacea is, to see what happens.</li>
            <li> This gives a nice cooling feel and 1 bottle lasts forever.</li>
            <li> Been using this product for years. It leaves my skin feeling soft and plump. I leave out the 5th star because I still get breakouts every now and then.</li>
            <li> I have rosacea and saw my dermatologist. She prescribed mirvaso ($90.00 cream) that hurt my face and made the condition worse. I carefully researched the condition, purchased The Body Shop Tea Tree Skin Clearing Facial Wash, Paula&#x27;s Choice Skin Perfecting 2% BHA Liquid, Resist C15 Super Booster (a vitimin C and E lotion) and the Eminence Blueberry Soy Night Recovery Cream. It didn&#x27;t hurt my face (just a little sting with the BHA Liquid but nothing like the harsh &amp;#34;medicine&amp;#34; the doctor prescribed) and my skin is much improved. I use the Blueberry Soy as a day moisturizer too and add MD Solar Sciences Tinted Mineral Beauty Balm SPF 50. I was not paid for this review and I don&#x27;t write them often but the products made such a difference I thought other women would really benefit.</li>
            <li> This face wash has been helpful for clearing up my rosacea. It leaves your face very clean feeling.</li>
            <li> If it came in a body wash, I would definitely order that as well. This brand is true tea-tree. I would recommend this to friends and buy it again for myself</li>
            <li> I just love the tingling sensation on my face , this product is great and it clears your skin😀</li>
            <li> Helps improve my skin. Would buy again.</li>
            <li> I bought this to help my sensitive, combination (closer to dry), acne-prone skin.  Tea tree oil is supposed to be good for skin like mine.  As a face wash, it&#x27;s okay.  Dries my skin out a little more than I&#x27;d like, and doesn&#x27;t clean it as well as other face washes I&#x27;ve used.  I&#x27;ll stick to Philosophy&#x27;s Purity Made Simple for my face wash.  I would have returned it, but then I discovered its other amazing use:  as a makeup brush cleaner!  Take a bowl, add some water, put one part olive oil, two parts of this Tea Tree Skin Clearing Facial Wash (it doesn&#x27;t have to be exact, just close), rinse brushes in mixture, and it&#x27;ll transform your old makeup brushes into their original soft, brand-new condition.  My MAC brush cleaner, a product designed for this purpose, doesn&#x27;t work half as well!</li>
            <li> This caused me to break out and have really horrendous acne problems that I hadn&#x27;t had since I was a teenager. I have fairly clear, slightly oily skin normally.</li>
            <li> Product seems pretty good. I&#x27;m not much of a &#x27;product-face-wash&#x27; kinda guy so I might not be the best reviewer but the stuff feels and smells good. It seems to help a little with acne. No effect on acne scars... but I didn&#x27;t expect it to help with the scarring.&lt;br /&gt;It was damaged in shipping- the top of the cap was busted off which is annoying.</li>
            <li> This facial wash was not perfect for my skin. It dried it after finishing washing my face. I did not like it and I will never use it again.</li>
            <li> I have tried literally everything i thought possible, nothing was working. Then i found this its like a life saver i get acne really bad on my forehead and i have been using this product for a week and all the acne is gone i am so happy!!! i would reccomend this to anyone!</li>
            <li> I what my children (middle-aged) call a &amp;#34;hot mess&amp;#34;.  I&#x27;m working hard trying to finish a book.  My house and myself are being neglected.  And, over the years I have developed something inside of my body that arrived to my scalp and face.  I didn&#x27;t have time to go looking for something to use.  (I feel so busy).  Well, when I bought this product about a month ago I liked it&#x27;s green color and the smell gave me hope--it seemed so healing.  But it was quick and easy to use it.  That mattered.  So I used it.  And, I took the advice of some women and used Tea Tree Oil or some other oils or witch-hazel, afterwards.  I did do that on a semi-regular basis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I honesly had &#x27;&#x27;scales&#x27;&#x27; on my 60+years&#x27; face and other irritations.  This product has done a good job.&lt;br /&gt;I am happy with the results and will continue using it.  --Margaret Opine</li>
            <li> This facial cleanser works great.&lt;br /&gt;It does, however, dry out my nose like crazy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t use it everyday due to that side effect.</li>
            <li> i really like this wash.  i typically use washes with benzol peroxide which work well for me, but i like to give my skin a break from so i will alternate and this seems to work as well.  it does dry your skin so make sure you moisturize after washing.</li>
            <li> I bought this for shingles but it didn&#x27;t work.  It makes a great face cleanser.It makes a great face cleanser.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t sealed, or protected. Some of the product was missing from the bottle. Didn&#x27;t get a full product. Disappointing</li>
            <li> Great!! I love it! It feels amazing and I do believe it works!</li>
            <li> Lovely smell! It effectively removes oil from my face and really clears my pores.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this a couple of times since it arrived. I love anything with tea tree oil in it because tea tree is a natural anti-fungal, sure to cure whatever is driving your skin bonkers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is a little over-drying for me personally, so I will only be using it a couple of times per week.</li>
            <li> Like the mint smell, definitely refreshing. Just not sure how thorough it cleans my make-up left inside the pores .</li>
            <li> Its good for a face wash but domt expect any chamges with this.</li>
            <li> I discovered this wash in the trial size aisle at Ulta. I can buy it for far less here on Amazon. I wash with this with a washcloth, and combined with a far-less pore-clogging foundation, my skin is less clogged up. I&#x27;m noticing less blackheads and less acne overall. This is gentle and effective. My skin is not less oily, but that&#x27;s a hormone thing, I think. (No wash will resolve that.) I also appreciate that this wash isn&#x27;t perfumed heavily.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite face wash to date! This is the only face wash that has cleared up my skin!</li>
            <li> Best product for blemishes and acne prone skin.&lt;br /&gt;I used so many products for acne but this has a great effect right from first use.</li>
            <li> great product, feels great, slightly tingly, makes my face feel fresh!</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this cleanser after reading all of the amazing reviews. However, this hasn&#x27;t improved my acne at all. My face doesn&#x27;t even feel clean after using it. I know Tea Tree Oil has a strong scent but the scent of this was overpowering. I just could not stand to have it on my face. If you&#x27;re looking for a good acne cleanser, I would suggest you keep looking because unfortunately this one is NOT it!</li>
            <li> I like this cleaning product</li>
            <li> Its refreshing, I don&#x27;t have a ton of acne but it cleans my face, I&#x27;ve used it for a week now and my face feels soft. Just smells like your washing your face with pine Sol or something lol. That&#x27;s my only complaint.</li>
            <li> Best cleanser I have ever used! I have rosacea and have tried countless expensive cleansers. After only a few days, I can already see and feel the difference. And, my skin feels clean longer, with no oil. I decided to add this to my monthly subscribe and save shipment so I can share it with my husband. So happy!</li>
            <li> I have used everything from proactive, Clinique, to neutrogena products and still always got terrible breakouts. I am in my 30&#x27;s and was so over having acne! I have combination skin with T zone issues. This face wash has been the best thing ever!! And is soooo much cheaper than others on the market! My friend suggested it to me and I have been using this whole line since! I use the face wash and lotion everyday and around my PMS times I use the astringent too. I do still get a random zit every other month but they are small and go away fast!  I can handle that! Oh and it lasts forever. I used my first bottle for 5 months!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not popping acne, I&#x27;m more like little blemishes here and there, but it hasn&#x27;t cleared me of those yet... so I suppose that feature is to be announced when and if I start seeing results. I must be a hard pressed type of complexion ahaha.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is awesome, like a perfume I used to have many many years ago called Poison Ivy, its its twin in scent. It takes a minute the lather but when it does it goes man, and it tingles when on. It leaves your face clean enough to literally shine, and for me it made me look less weathered, (I&#x27;ve been having some down days, normally I look 18 when I&#x27;m actually 30 so restoring my overall youthfullness was nice). Other than that, we&#x27;ll see with the skin clearing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I&#x27;ve had it since it showed up on the 8th of this month (october) and I have to say its working like a Boss, and I switch when I was my face like late at night around 9 or a little earlier at 6pm. I somedays wash twice in the morning then at night, and my blemishes are both going away and have gone away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And you know how you feel them just below the surface when you rub your face? I don&#x27;t feel them! Its a wonder. I&#x27;d buy it again. Although, you might need moisturizer for between your eyes, and down along the sides of your nose- it gets a little dry. But I think that might be the bit when it helps complexion tone. *shrug*</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work for my acne, but I may just have stubborn adult acne that requires medical help. Smells good though.</li>
            <li> I just started using this about a week ago and I&#x27;m very happy with it.  I&#x27;m 61, have moderate rosacea and the accompanying blemishes.  My doctor prescribed MetroGel which is a very effective topical treatment, but I have been experimenting with the rest of my facial routine, and this wash is a welcome addition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This tingles when I use it, but does not irritate my skin.  Leaves my face feeling stimulated and ultra clean, as well as smooth.  I haven&#x27;t noticed any drying effects because I follow with a (non-oily) moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***UPDATE***  Been using this for over a year now, and I can&#x27;t imagine washing my face with anything else.  Gentle enough it never irritates or dries me out, but awesome for knocking back the rosacea and break-outs.</li>
            <li> I use the body shop tea tree line daily for years; it has kept my face amazingly clear and hydrated. I swear by this line, just try: face wash, night lotion for blemishs, make up primer closes pores instantly. This the best!!</li>
            <li> I love everything about this but the smell.</li>
            <li> Has not worked for me at all.  My face actually looks worse. Also doesn&#x27;t give off that CLEAN feeling after a good wash. I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> Overall good product...I just wish the moisturizing factor was there. Smells good and cleans like it should. This was recommended for use during pregnancy.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this product. I have been dealing with breakouts ever since I can remember and since I started using this (daily), a few weeks ago, my skin has been clearer than ever before!</li>
            <li> I purchased for my college are daughter. She has tried other products, this one is her favorite. She has requested more.</li>
            <li> Loved this and all of the Body Shop line. I tried so many of those popular brands and they didn&#x27;t really work well. But the Body Shop.... This works stupendously, especially if coupled with the moisturizer and the toner; follow up weekly with a mask and you will see results. I would highly recommend this product to others.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my little brother, who is just starting to get really bad acne. When he uses this with the lotion, it clears his skin right up. It feels a little weird at first (leaves an oily feeling on your face) but those oils- the tea tree- is so good for acne prone skin. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> The Body Shop Tea Tree Oil face wash is something I would confidently recommend to anyone looking for something gentle that will totally remove acne and breakouts. I&#x27;ve tried and tested it for myself so I&#x27;m sure it will work for anyone.</li>
            <li> This is one of the worst facial products I have ever tried. I tried contacting The Body Shop &amp; they said you would have to give me a refund because they refuse. My face is still terribly broken out from this. This is a TERRIBLE product!!!!!</li>
            <li> Great and has a month feeling after rinse</li>
            <li> I have not used this wash for long. So far...so good. It has not dried my skin out...yet. Smell is not too pleasing...but that is the only down side.</li>
            <li> It worked great on my skin. I have less breakouts since using this product.</li>
            <li> I use this facial wash every morning as I have adult acne.  This wash keeps my face free and clear of blemishes, and it doesn&#x27;t leave my face dry at all.  My face gets oilier during Spring and Summer.  I started using this product at the beginning of Spring and haven&#x27;t seen a blemish.  Thanks Body Shop!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t use this as your morning cleanser or before you go out! It smells funny. But it feels nice and it is very effective, so I use it at night only.</li>
            <li> Good stuff.  I like the body wash a little better.</li>
            <li> I tried some other ones to see if they take care of my acne. This one seems better but still not perfect. However, it cleans my face well.</li>
            <li> Good wash for a fresh face. Love the smell.</li>
            <li> This face wash has been the only thing that helped my skin during a crazy break out that clinique acne didn&#x27;t even touch. I&#x27;m definitely loyal to this face wash now.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for several years. My skin stays clear and balanced. I usually order 3 at a time and people buy me this product as part of my gifts :)  I will never stop using it!!!</li>
            <li> Very suitable for one of my products, the effect is very good, hope can bring pleasantly surprised to me.It&#x27;s cool~</li>
            <li> This stuff is the greatest. I&#x27;ve had acne ranging from eh to pizza face. Since I&#x27;ve started using this stuff, I&#x27;ve noticed a difference, not only in my acne, but in my overall skin texture. It&#x27;s a lot more smooth and less oily than before. Less dry patches as well. The smell is amazing and usually wakes me up a little bit.&lt;br /&gt;Obviously, this works on my skin but everyone&#x27;s is different. It&#x27;s a fabulous product and I&#x27;m glad that I found it.</li>
            <li> Feels and smells good when using it.</li>
            <li> Liked the way my face felt when I used this product, actually used it on the body too.  Didn&#x27;t need to use a lot of the wash just a little bit does the job.  I thought it was going to be a smelly product but after I use it the smell disappears.</li>
            <li> Only $7.00 for this?  What a deal.  This bottle is going to last me forever.  You only need a little to lather over your face and the bottle although small has a lot of product in there.  It gives a nice tingle on your face and lathers nicely.  I gave it 4 stars though because it does make my face feel dry and smells like the bad end of a tree if you know what I mean.</li>
            <li> I really like this product!</li>
            <li> Love this cleanser and was at a great price versus going to the mall to get it!</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my daughter, and she loves the Tea Tree series.  I will definitely purchase this again and again.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for 11 days, I finally stopped and I wish I had stopped sooner. 3 days after I started using this face wash I broke out all over my face I have never had a breakout this bad, I read  on some sites that at first the face &#x27;&amp;#34;purges&amp;#34;&amp;#34; but it has been 11 days and it&#x27;s only getting worse, I am not sure if it will eventually get better but I had enough, I am using an anti biotic now to clear my face and will go back to just using my old mild face wash and BP . I do not personally recommend this tea tree face wash.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t really feel my face as refreshed as I would like it.  The price is also a downer!</li>
            <li> Ive used several daily washes but I really like this product the most because first its my favorite color green. Second it has a natural anti bacterial agent in tea tree oil. And lastly ever since I have been using this product I feel my skin is cleaner less likely to get acne.</li>
            <li> Hated this cleanser,it actually made me break out more than I have since high school.  Now I am a pizza face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 20-year-old male, and I have been using this product for 2 years. I&#x27;m very satisfied with it. It makes my skin smooth and reduces the oil. I think its helpful for acne.</li>
            <li> This does leave my face very clean but also turns my skin red for about an hour after washing with this. I&#x27;m not sure what it is as I&#x27;ve applied tea tree oil directly to my face before without a problem. YMMV but if you have sensitive skin I would try something else first.</li>
            <li> My first time trying this product and I will be ordering others from the line. Really cleans my skin well and helps with acne</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still breaking out! Maybe not the best solution for oily skin? I&#x27;ve been using it for two weeks now and my skin has not gotten better</li>
            <li> Excellent results!  My skin is smooth and blemish free just by using this product for a solid week!  The smell is very calming and nice as well!</li>
            <li> I use this with my Clairsonic Mia 2, I have very oily acne prone skin and I use this suck all the oil out of face at night so its a blank canvas to absorb all my bed time moisturizers! Only thing I will say is try to avoid it spilling down to your eyes because of the tea tree it does leave a tingling effect! I have accidentally let run down my eyes while using my clairsonic in the shower, other than that I love this product!!</li>
            <li> Only facial wash I buy. Works quickly, pleasant armor and assist in maintaining a clear complexion.</li>
            <li> clean and fresh feeling after facial wash with this. I and my wife enjoyed in the morning and night.</li>
            <li> This has got to be kind of cheap knock off. I broke out all over using this which has never happened before and it STINKS to high heaven.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know what tea tree smelled like...this product made me realize I don&#x27;t like the smell of tea tree AT ALL. make sure you know what tea tree smells like before you buy</li>
            <li> A really gentle cleanser that you can use daily.  I have also used with my facial scrubber and it is still gentle on the face.  Its nice for the feet and hands, too.</li>
            <li> I just received it today. I give it 1 star because it smells good. I used about a dime size of this product, washed my face and instantly my face was over dried and flaky. I don&#x27;t usually have over oily skin or dry skin, it&#x27;s pretty even keeled just wanted to use it because I have broken out lately for no real reason but this is ridiculous after the first time using it. I do usually write reviews for things I purchase but thought I should share my opinion.</li>
            <li> This skin wash has continued to help me fight adult acne!  Best face cleanser!</li>
            <li> you have to use a lot of it to get suds...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had bad skin since middle school, and nothing has really worked to consistently keep it clear. I&#x27;ve tried almost every off-the-shelf product, spent a couple years on Proactive, and have tried 3 or 4 different topical prescriptions, all with minimal reliable results. But after a few months of this stuff, my skin has never looked better. Still get the occasional pimple, but they&#x27;re nowhere near as large or long-lasting as before. HIGHLY recommended if you&#x27;ve tried everything else and aren&#x27;t sure where else to turn. (Just be patient and give it a few weeks to kick in before you give up.)</li>
            <li> Loveeee this product. Although ive used this product for over two months now, i could tell the difference in my face after just one use. So soft and smooth. The smell is fresh. I dont always remember to wash my face daily, but this product makes me want to take the time to do it no matter how tired i am, because of how refreshed my face feels afterwards. Im in my late twenties and recently started breaking out after my child was born. Ive used every product, pill, cream a doctor could prescribe and recommend. This product is amazing. Everyones skin is different, so it may not work for you...but its worth a try.</li>
            <li> I use this every day. It is so refreshing and feels so good. I keep reading complaints about the smell but I find it soothing.</li>
            <li> This is my second time buying this baby. I absolutely love using just a few drops of this all over my face in my morning shower. I have noticed that throughout the months I&#x27;ve been using this (nearly a year), I have had nearly NO breakouts or problem pimples. This has become a staple in my regimen. I love the tingly, cold, fresh sensations it gives. After using it, my face feels so smooth and clean!</li>
            <li> LOVE this cleanser. Smells great and leaves my face feeling super clean.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 25 with oily teenager skin, and I am telling you, this stuff works magic. The tea tree oil really helps with acne and oiliness, and it smells and feels so refreshing. I use this wash everyday along with the toner.</li>
            <li> I have never tried this product. I love it. the Tea tree face soap is great. The price was great and the quantity is worth it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this tea tree facial wash for a few weeks now and have noticed a difference in the clarity of my skin. It hasn&#x27;t completely cleared my skin, but has done a great job in reducing the amount of breakouts. Nice clean tea tree smell which isn&#x27;t too overpowering and you can feel the clean after using the wash. Love this product, will definitely be looking for other tea tree products of this line!</li>
            <li> Invigorating scent, and really strips down to the bare skin. Great for oily, or acne prone skin. Probably too drying for sensitive or dry skin, but that&#x27;s not the purpose of this stuff! It truly leaves my face squeaky clean when used with my spinning facial brush. Highly recommend if you are a fan of tea tree products. Good size for price, nice value.</li>
            <li> My face feels clean without drying it out. Smells amazing too!</li>
            <li> This product contains a host of comedegenics (as do a lot of, if not most OTC acne creams/lotions), including but not limited to sodium laureth sulfate, hydrogenated castor oil, etc.  There are more, look at any site which has a listing of comedegenic ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this along with the toner and the moisturizer about a year ago and used it for 3-4 weeks.  I had previously been using a salicylic acid-based treatment which was horrible and I had heard good things about tea tree oil.  Unfortunately, the combination of these products made my skin infinitely worse when I used them as directed.  It actually seemed like it was helping reduce the amount of acne on my face the first week but by the third week....craters, everywhere.  There&#x27;s also the fact that every single one of these products is extremely drying, which will only irritate your face more if you have naturally dry skin.  I stopped using them and went to see a dermatologist after that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most people who are naturally prone to acne either have really dry skin or combination skin and this product does not work for the former type of skin at least.  This product punishes your skin, which may trick some into thinking it&#x27;s working but its not.  You need to pamper your skin.  I think for my face, the most beneficial OTC treatment has always been benzoyl peroxide, although that is also extremely drying.  You need a moisturizer to go along with it, but I do not trust most &amp;#34;nongreasy&amp;#34; moisturizers at the pharmacy because most of them contain comedegenic ingredients and/or tighten the skin.  Personally I actually use 100% petroleum jelly and have found that it not only keeps in moisture, but also lightens the skin and restores color to the dry/peeled parts of my skin.  It also seems to make existing pimples on my face run their course more quickly and lightens my scars.  I&#x27;ve only been using it for about four days though so only time will tell.  But do not punish your face by buying this product.  If you are a person who only occasionally gets a pimple then 100% Natural Tea Tree oil can definitely work as a spot treatment, but this whole set of chemical crap....no thanks.  I would not recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> I have oily skin and am prone to breakouts, but am also getting older and wanted something less harsh. I find the tea tree oil in this product fits that bill perfectly. I have used this product for a year now and my skin has never been better.</li>
            <li> Normally this is the best cleanser ever , when bought from the body shop , but this is not the real deal. It was too runny and didn&#x27;t smell right. I don&#x27;t know if it was really old or if it was watered down or not even the right stuff at all . It is going back and I will just buy from TBS from now on.</li>
            <li> Hands down, my favorite facial wash ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t really have acne, nor did I ever suffered from it, but I do get occasional break-outs and plenty of red spots, so I was looking for something to help clear up my skin and improve its health. This stuff does an amazing job of keeping my skin clean and fresh. I use konjac facial sponge in the morning and an electronic facial brush in the evening, and I always reach for the tea tree facial wash from The Body Shop to make sure my skin gets some extra boost of healthy ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tea tree extracts have strong anti-bacterial properties, so if you suffer from breakouts or acne, this should really make a difference for your skin. I am not sure what the concentration of tea tree extract is in this product, but judging by the smell, it is quite a bit. I love the fresh, energizing smell of this facial wash! It is a very specific type of smell, and if you haven&#x27;t used tea tree oil / products before, you will probably have to get used to it, but I actually really enjoy minty, herbal types of smells, so this was just perfect for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: I purchased the product from The Body Shop&#x27;s online store.</li>
            <li> This face wash is the best!  It blasts acne on my face and anywhere else and I&#x27;ve even used it to fight off a light attack of poison oak!</li>
            <li> Smells good. Leaves my face clean and feeling all tingly.</li>
            <li> This product works very well, and isn&#x27;t harsh on my skin at all! It&#x27;s a fantastic cleanser for the price, and it lasts a long time! It also removes makeup good as well! I would most likely repurchase this at full price!</li>
            <li> It just ok types, nothing different than other facial soap. It just body shop.. so I bought it .</li>
            <li> I always use this face wash so I am happy to use it again</li>
            <li> I decided to try this product after the reviews stated it was good for roseca. When the package arrived it was all in one piece and looked ok. When I opened the bottle, there was no safety seal and it looked like the bottle had been used before. Needless to say, I returned the product. I can&#x27;t say if it worked or didn&#x27;t because I&#x27;m not using anything that came in the mail without a safety seal. I was dissapointed.</li>
            <li> It has a very strong smell but love it for my face</li>
            <li> Generally the product is quite nice: it smells great, it feels good when I wash my skin with it, it has nice structure, and it actually significantly reduced the number of pimples on my face. But! And it is a very important but. It also irritates my skin a lot. The case is that, though my skin is very-very oily, it is also very-very sensitive. So I need to use only mild, non-perfumed, alcohol-free products. And this face wash contains Alcohol. Keep in mind that this facial wash contains Menthol also. I presume that the amount of menthol is very-very small and used for perfuming purposes, but maybe it can also cause skin irritation.&lt;br /&gt;So I would say that only if your skin is just oily and blemished, you should use this product. But if you have normal, dry, sensitive or mixed skin type you better use something else.</li>
            <li> I ordered two bottles cause i used it before and it really is the same original facial wash from the physical Body Shop. I received the product promptly, however there was a little dent on one of the bottles, probs due to the shipping process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, i have very sensitive skin but this wash works wonders! When i use it regularly (daily), i start to feel that my skin&#x27;s blemishes will slowly disappear and leaves my face skin really clear! Will buy again!</li>
            <li> I have very, very oily skin. I mean oily to the fact that when I wash my face I start oiling up again in 3-5 minutes. Since I am so oily I have been suffering from breakouts as long as I can remember. It&#x27;s something that I had gotten used to and lived with. However, I came across the Body Shop tea tree clearing wash and I have been using it for the past 5 months now and I am glad to say, I love it!!! It takes off all my makeup and oil and makes my skin feel and look so clean and clearer. I usually follow up my regimen with the tea tree toner with takes more excess oil off and I am left with a fresh clean face. I have noticed I am breaking out a lot less now ( A LOT LESS) and I want to try the body wash in the same line and see it that will help the rest of my skin. I will not use any other face wash after discovering this.</li>
            <li> i love this item, special smell, comfortable feeling on my face and lots of foam. And most importantly, it works like a magic~!It does reduce the acne on my face in a short time!&lt;br /&gt;Recommend to everyone!</li>
            <li> Hi&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this for my daugher. She was having trouble with acne and I read that this works. Well after several weeks of using it I am happy to say her acne has improved quite a bit. Very good stuff. Will continue to purchase</li>
            <li> I love anything mint!! I&#x27;m absolutely thrilled with this product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s helped a lot with any blemishes tho my skin is still not clear clear I still have some scars,blemishes,&amp; a ton of blackheads but this product has helped a lot</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for almost two months now and have not noticed any improvement to my skin, no less acne or redness. To me, it is not worth the price when I see no difference. Fyi, my skin type is oily with moderate acne, a couple breakouts a month.</li>
            <li> Before my skin changed, I was completely reliant on this line from The Body Shop. It worked wonderfully for my oily, acne prone skin without irritation or over drying. I do recommend that people get a sample from their local shop, if possible, before ordering this. Tea tree is irritating to some people&#x27;s skin.</li>
            <li> I like this face wash from the body shop line. I dont have very strong facial acne but I do get few zits here and there. I am not sure if it does anything to help prevent or reduce that but it definitely gives a nice and clean feel after use. The smell of tea tree is great. I buy this product regularly.</li>
            <li> The safety seal was broken, but I used it anyway. I love the feel of this wash on my face. I used the facial brush with this and I only have to squirt out a small amount of cleanser to soap up my entire face. It foams up nicely and has a nice cooling effect because of the menthol. I let it sit on my face for two minutes before washing it off that way the cleanser has a chance to work on my skin. You cannot expect results if you wash it off immediately. It is silky smooth coming off and my skin is soft as well. All in all it is a great cleanser that gives a deep down clean. Bonus! It has also reduced the blackheads on my nose.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong, this product DOES work on certain people. My girlfriend who has the most beautiful skin in the entire world (smooth af) has used this product for a while and recommended it to me because my skin is prone to regular acne breakouts, or so has been ever since I stopped using the anti acne cleanser that worked best for me. So I gave this a try and all it does is make my face feel smooth and refreshed, but the acne hasn&#x27;t stopped breaking out. So as far as blemishes and acne goes, this product DID NOT WORK FOR ME. But 3 stars because it DOES work on certain people and makes one&#x27;s skin feel smooth no matter what I believe.</li>
            <li> This product ordered on accident but I still receive the product after canceling. I actually had just ordered some from the body shop. I have had moderate acne all my life,  it comes and goes. This product with the toner and lotion works great. It&#x27;s clearing the dark spots I had on my face from when I picked my face, they&#x27;re almost gone. Sometimes I forget to wash my face before I got to sleep and get a pimple, wash my face in the morning and it&#x27;s already starting to go away. I also bought the scrub (which I love), the mask (which I love), and the cooling creme cleanser (which is a little oily feeling but it makes your skin feel very clean and refreshed).</li>
            <li> This is a favorite for both my wife and I. Many other facial washes (especially ones that are castile soap based) seem to leave the face very dry and sometimes sting a bit when using. This lathers good, smells great, never stings and leaves the face feeling hydrated.</li>
            <li> Its hard to rate personal items but I will anyhow. I am 29 and have had some kind of acne for as long as I can remember. I have used a lot of products, some good some not so good. This smells pretty good, has a bit of a camphor smell (not exactly but difficult to pinpoint the actual smell). I only used it about 2 weeks, then returned it. The Body Shop was very good at authorizing the return, and refunded me as soon as the package was scanned out on my end. FAST!</li>
            <li> LOVE IT!  It makes my skin so soft and it feels so fresh! I wish I could carry it around all day and just periodically wash my face.</li>
            <li> I am a huge fan of tea tree oil and I wasn&#x27;t really a huge fan of this product, think I&#x27;ll stick to other brands. Didn&#x27;t really seem to clear up any blemishes.</li>
            <li> My daughter has blackheads and acne that doesn&#x27;t respond to most OTC products. The dermatologist prescribed a number of expensive creams that had absolutely no effect either. After several years of frustration, I decided to try a sample pack of The Body Shop Tea Tree Line. After 3 months of using three products routinely her skin is 80% clear. So happy with the results! She uses this facial wash, the toner and the moisturizer. We&#x27;re going to add the face mask next and see if we can get her skin totally clear. She is not brushing her hair down to hide her face anymore. Really very happy with this product. A little bit goes a long way as well. Everyone&#x27;s skin responds differently to products but if you (like my daughter) are completely frustrated, give it a shot. It has made a tremendous difference for her.</li>
            <li> My daughter has very sensitive skin, and other products have not been good for her. Proactiv dries her skin, Clean and Clear does not keep the pimples away, and Nuetragena leaves her oily. The Body Shop keeps her skin clear and clean, without over-drying.  The reason we give it 4 stars instead of 5 is because it&#x27;s very strong and the tingling sensation is almost too much for her sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It is a good product and really helpful. I am using last couple of months and get benefited.  I&#x27;ll recommended to my friend.</li>
            <li> Great smell, lathers easily, gets your face clean. Slightly astringent, and a little drying which is what I was looking for. One bottle goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I was hoping for a great smelling product to try but this soap smells like gasoline! Maybe I just got a bad bottle but they lost this customer.</li>
            <li> I am a HUGE fan of the Body Shop&#x27;s Tea Tree Oil face wash! It clears up acne prone skin in a matter of days even in your 30s!!!</li>
            <li> This is an amazing face wash! I will never use anything else after trying this product.  I have been using it for a couple of months now and have noticed a big difference in acne breakouts and complexion.  It is great for getting all your make up off too! Usually I would always have mascara and makeup  left over after other face washes that would end up on my towel, but not with this one!</li>
            <li> This is an excellent cleaning product. I use it on my face with fantastic results. It leaves my face clean and moisturized and it has drastically reduced my acne outbreaks. It also has a clean, crisp scent that leaves my face feeling and smelling great.  Will buy again!</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing, my kids use it and it really helps there skin.. With regular use of course. I recommend..</li>
            <li> I bought this product even though i have normal skin without many blemishes.  Even though this face wash isn&#x27;t exactly &amp;#34;made&amp;#34; for me, I love it anyway.  It does not dry out my skin, and leaves it soft and smooth feeling.  I have found a new favorite.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my 13 year old son and he uses it everyday and loves it.  He has started to get the &#x27;dreaded&#x27; pimples and I have noticed by using this product, his face looks great and healthy..it doesn&#x27;t seem to dry it out or anything.  It also smells very nice.  I keep telling him to use just a little bit, because a little goes a long way with this.....</li>
            <li> This is THE best stuff on the planet.  I&#x27;ve had horrible skin for over 10 years and have literally tried EVERYTHING. I even went on Accutane when I was 18 for 6 months. It cleared up my skin initially but then about 2 years later, my acne came back. I&#x27;ve tried several other prescription drugs and topical creams and everything possible at the drug store and nothing has worked...until this! I had a facial recently and my facialist told me I should try tea tree oil products because they are anti-fungal and really help oil the acne causing bacteria. OMG. It&#x27;s been 3 weeks and my skin is AMAZING!  It&#x27;s completely  clear! I&#x27;ve always had issues with hyper-pigmentation even after the pimple disappeared and this has evened out my skin like nothing I&#x27;ve ever used!  I use my face wash with a clarisonic mia as well so it gets the best cleaning possible. My skin feels so refreshed and soft after I&#x27;m done.  Seriously, if you have acne-prone skin and have tried everything else, give this a shot. It&#x27;s incredible!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: The first week I used it, my skin was REALLY DRY.  So I added a little bit of deep moisturizer in combination with the Tea Tree Skin Clearing Lotion which helped a lot! Now my skin is used to it and is literally amazing.  I also use the toner, moisturizer, face mask (twice a week) and BB cream. LOVE LOVE this whole line!</li>
            <li> I have long had Seborrheic dermatitis on my checks, and have always had to use prescription steroid creams to keep it under control. Now after using this face wash and DermaZinc cream for a little over a month I&#x27;ve stopped using my prescription. Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sumptuous, beautiful, lovely to use. Using this product has taken my face to another level. It makes my hands soft too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy to use, compact to store, beautifully made! Like Christmas in the bottle#</li>
            <li> Made my skin breakout overnight. I am not one of those people who believes in skin purges when switching cleansers. That has never happened to me when I have found a good cleanser.</li>
            <li> i love this product! i wash my face everyday with it. I wake up and my skin has like an oily soft feel to it, but not like extremely oily if that makes any sense lol. My face is like baby butt soft i love it!</li>
            <li> I just found out about using tea tree oil based products for acne not to long ago.  I used to use salicylic acid on my skin for years and never got the kind of results I get from tea tree oil products.  Great for problematic skin.</li>
            <li> Best face wash for breakouts!</li>
            <li> My family and I love The Body Shop Tea Tree products. Everything was delivered as expected and at an unbeatable price.</li>
            <li> Great for my skin and takes care of blemishes better than anything</li>
            <li> Fantastic! has combated the acne I received by taking biotin.</li>
            <li> I must have really sensitive skin or something, because every time I used this, I broke out even worse than before. I have oily skin with acne that isn&#x27;t crazy terrible, just enough to piss me off. I saw so many good reviews for this I had to try it. However, my skin reacted terribly. I thought maybe it was just a one time chance, but every time I washed my face with it, it would break out in a day or two. I gave it 2 stars, however, because it is a good body wash. For some reason the skin on my body is more accepting of it. But for the money I spent on it, I wish it worked better!</li>
            <li> I like washing my face with this so much. It leaves my skin soft and feeling clean and clear. I use it with the tea tree oil itself and it works really great in treating my zits. I also love the smell.</li>
            <li> Great product... nice clean feeling after washing my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All the Body Shop locations having been closing area DFW area. :(</li>
            <li> I bought this product a little over a month ago because I&#x27;ve always had a problem with acne on my chin and figured a natural facial wash might be the key to helping.  I was incorrect.  I actually got an increase of breakouts and my face is in pain with all of the bumps.  I guess this product only works well for certain skin type people.</li>
            <li> Dr Pham my eye doctor recommended I really like the product it is working very well for me. Thank you Rick</li>
            <li> I will never use any other product again!</li>

            <li> Glad to see so many great reviews of this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, I have sensitive, combination and acne prone skin. I&#x27;ve tried many cleansers over the years and have found they have either been too expensive or too drying for my skin.  For instance, I really like Dermaquest&#x27;s enzyme cleanser ($30) and Cor&#x27;s silver soap ($40), but they are rather expensive -- great products though.  I came across The Body Shop&#x27;s (TBS) tea tree cleanser a few weeks ago and found I have really liked using it for many reasons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In terms of value, I find it is decent, as a little does seem like it goes a long way.  TBS also runs sales and emails me coupons, so I would be able to purchase at a reduced price in the future (though I did purchase this using a 20% off coupon code).  In fact, they recently had a 40% off coupon code for the Memorial Day holiday. Free shipping at their website if you spend over $50 is a nice perk too.  Of course, there is the free shipping deal from Amazon if you spend over $25, so shipping costs are not a problem for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The face wash itself is a nice consistency and leaves a cool feeling on my face, which is perfect for the hot/humid weather we have been having in my area.  One of the best parts is that my skin does not feel dry at all after using it, which has been great.  There is a slight &amp;#34;tea tree&amp;#34; scent from it, which doesn&#x27;t bother me and seems to go away quickly.  I also use this with my Clarasonic (acne head).  The verdict is still out as to whether the Clarisonic itself does anything for my skin (I&#x27;ve had it nearly 3 years), but I have been really liking their new acne head as of late.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, the tea tree facial wash is worth trying if you have combination skin, as I have found it hasn&#x27;t dried me out, yet seems to leave my skin feeling clean and fresh.  If you&#x27;re not sure about it, there&#x27;s a mini version of it on TBS&#x27;s website for $4, which makes for a nice travel size as well.  It also comes in a kit with a full size tea tree oil and mini sizes of their tea tree lotion &amp; toner for $25.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  10/11/13&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used this cleanser through the Summer and I have to say that I really have grown to love it.  I failed to mention above that I have sensitive, combination, acne-prone skin, so it&#x27;s rather a nightmare to find a good cleanser at a good price.  We had a very humid Summer, so my skin was very oily.  That was no problem for this cleanser!  Additionally, my skin never felt irritated after washing, which is very typical with other cleansers.  In fact the only cleanser that my skin did not react to was [[ASIN:B001UTORJA Cor Silver Soap, 1.05 oz]] -- it&#x27;s great, but, wow...expensive (though it&#x27;s on sale at the moment).  Anyway, I will continue with TBS&#x27;s cleanser through the Winter to see how my skin responds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  03/10/15&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m still using this product.  I did find it a touch drying during the Winter, but I still used it.  I think this is the longest I&#x27;ve ever used a facial cleanser...lol.izes of their tea tree lotion &amp; toner for $25.
