            <li>I could tell this was the perfect wig for me.  </li>

            <li>It&#x27;s going on a month and the wig is still looking good, of course with the help of wig</li>
            <li>That color is a perfect match for my hair color; however, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s as full as the 1B.  </li>
            <li>Very pleased with the time taken to ship and receive the wig I ordered.</li>

            <li>This wig is light and hair held up great.</li>
            <li>It blends so well...and looks like your own hair.</li>
            <li>The track blends in nicely as well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice wig....</li>
            <li>The curls looked really nice</li>
            <li>I purchased the 1B color and it blended so well with my own hair.  </li>
            <li>Perfect protective style and the older</li>
            <li>It matched my hair perfectly and I have no regrets about buying it.</li>
            <li>The hair is beautiful, soft luxurious, blended well with own hair line and hair.</li>
            <li>My friends love it.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay for a $20 wig.</li>
            <li>i was able to make it work.</li>
            <li>I was so nervous about buying a wig over the internet, but I am SO glad I did.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe people would give it more than a &amp;#34;1&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Unless I tell people, most people think it&#x27;s my hair...</li>
            <li>The more you wear it the better</li>
            <li>its more like an inch.</li>
            <li>I completely LOVE</li>
            <li>Maybe over time it will fill out more.  </li>
            <li>Love this wig.</li>
            <li>This is a great wig for natural and transitioning divas.</li>
            <li>because i am pretty good at shaping hair to fit my face</li>
            <li>I always get the correct order, the wig is always good, and it always ships fast.</li>
            <li>Great Half Wig, natural looking curls and would blend perfectly with a 3C curl pattern.</li>
            <li>Arrived very quickly</li>
            <li>Freetress Creta Girl used to be my GO-TO quick natural hair fix on days I was in a rush to get somewhere and still look beautiful.</li>
            <li>Product was exactly what I was looking for, and I will be ordering from your company again this time in my own account.</li>
            <li>True to color, I&#x27;m buying another one, cant wait :)</li>
            <li>Very fast service!!</li>
            <li>Thank you very much!!</li>
            <li>I really enjoy the look and feel of this piece</li>
            <li>so you feel like its really secure...</li>
            <li>I had to lightly layer to fit my face of course.</li>
            <li>it gets the better and more natural</li>
            <li>I have even used the wig as a full cap and in its a pony tail option.</li>
            <li>For me it&#x27;s full hair with a lot of body.</li>
            <li>If you intend to use it for a protective style it is PERFECT to say the least.</li>
            <li>I wear mine in a bun, covered by my real hair and it blend so nicely and really protects my hair.</li>
            <li>Wow!!!!!</li>
            <li>But, at the end of the day, it was worth</li>
            <li>I was able to &amp;#34;rehab&amp;#34; it after watching some Youtube videos but the original curls never came back.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve just received \\&quot;Creta Girl\\&quot; and right out of the box</li>
            <li>I honestly liked it when I first put it on my head, but when I wore it the second day it started to tangle and shed.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better to just buy a human hair version (100%, remy) and keep it for years than to buy this synthetic, quick wig.</li>
            <li>Other than that, you can blend it easily &amp; I lasted for 2 weeks looking better with age.</li>
            <li>This wig is very long so understand you can always cut it and make it your own.</li>
            <li>It frizzed up very quickly and the material it&#x27;s made out of is too soft so</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been natural for about 12 years now and wanted something I could blend with my own natural texture.</li>
            <li>The older the wig is the more natural looking</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I do not recommend this product for any one looking for something that will last more than a day or two.</li>
            <li>When I first bought it wore it off and on for about two weeks at a time.</li>
            <li>One girl was able to cut it so that it wasn&#x27;t so big.  </li>
            <li>I love this wig but did not realize it was so long.  </li>
            <li>Maybe my head is just to large.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t understand why anyone would leave the house wearing this thing on their head.</li>
            <li>I really hope it will go away eventually</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t wait to really play with it and blend it with my hair.  </li>
            <li>As you wear it more and more...it does get bigger and has a natural look to it.</li>
            <li>The hair is very light, fluffy and big.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>it blends really well with natural hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The color was natural looking others though it was my real hair.</li>
            <li>The item was well packed, and brand new.</li>
            <li>The wig is very natural looking.</li>
            <li>Once it gets a little old it will look even more natural.</li>
            <li>but yet again, it looked exactly like the picture after taking a second look.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very big and makes your head hot.</li>
            <li>But then again there are a lot of people with the same straight hair...</li>
            <li>Its not a wig to last you for a whole year...</li>
            <li>It looks natural and not wiggy.</li>
            <li>I have natural hair and was hopeful that this piece would compliment my tresses.  </li>
            <li>Wow...</li>
            <li>It is probably ready to be retired or worn as a bun, but it definitely lasted a while in my opinion for synthetic hair.</li>
            <li>In the morning I put on my Creta Girl, undo my twists, arrange and pin to make it look natural, and I&#x27;m I done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really think it&#x27;s BIG hair unless you want it to be.</li>
            <li>so if you&#x27;re ready for some big curly bushy hair this is it!</li>
            <li>The consumer also ships fast, overall no problems here</li>
            <li>The pony tail is flat and the curls are large and loose, not small and spirally like they normally are.</li>
            <li>for the first time, I have to wet my hair and use a ton of gel for it to blend well.</li>
            <li>Most of the other wigs I&#x27;ve seen look a little \\&quot;jerry curl-ish\\&quot; or too shiny</li>
            <li>It was much too long for my personal taste</li>
            <li>To me it has the same volume as my natural hair with</li>
            <li>i have a very small face and this wig was huge.</li>
            <li>I would like to give it 3 and a half stars really...</li>
            <li>The previous versions were full, blended well with natural hair with little effort, and lasted a long time.</li>

            <li> I would like to give it 3 and a half stars really...</li>
            <li> The previous versions were full, blended well with natural hair with little effort, and lasted a long time.</li>
            <li> I flat twist my hair underneath and leave out enough hair to make about three medium size two-strand twists.</li>
            <li> and it lasts such a long time.</li>
            <li> Not because it was too big, but because it was too long for me.</li>
            <li> This half wig is awsome, it feels soft</li>
            <li> So the overall look wasn&#x27;t what I expected.  </li>
            <li> The hair will get bigger and bigger because its curly, but all you have to do it cut it a little.</li>
            <li> The wig I received, although new and well packaged, only lasted 1 day and the quality was poor.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The wig arrived faster than I expected and the packaging was great.&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
            <li> I have been a long time fan of Freetress Creta Girl and it has been increasingly hard to find at my local retail beauty supply stores</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered quite a few of this wig and i&#x27;d say on average it last about a month.</li>
            <li> In 2 days w/ expected time of 5-7 days!</li>
            <li> the wig can be purchased cheaper elsewhere; however with shipping costs, it will average out the same.&lt;br</li>
            <li> my issue is the 1b isn&#x27;t as dark as it should be....</li>
            <li> I will take it to a beauty shop to have it trimmed down, which I believe is all I need</li>
            <li> I thought it would be about a half inch or less in diameter.</li>
            <li> Since Jan. I have been wearing it as my everyday wig.</li>
            <li> Not sure if I just got a bad one after receiving really good ones, however I am disappointed that I wasted my cash on this, this time around.</li>
            <li> I would recommend cutting this wig or trying different styles to mix it up.</li>
            <li> I cut at least 4 or 5 inches off mine to give it some shape.</li>
            <li> but I do have really thick 4b hair.</li>
            <li> It looked synthetic, I hated it.</li>

            <li> Very fast service!! Thank you very much!! Product was exactly what I was looking for, and I will be ordering from your company again this time in my own account. As my son ordered it for me as a gift to me! I really enjoy the look and feel of this piece and it lasts such a long time. Thank you again!</li>
            <li> Beautiful!!!!! Lots of compliments. My friends love it.  Wow!!!!!</li>
            <li> R U transitioning, this is the wig for you. It blends so well...and looks like your own hair. great buy</li>
            <li> Very pleased with the time taken to ship and receive the wig I ordered. The item was well packed, and brand new. Excellent quality, excellent service!</li>
            <li> This half wig is awsome, it feels soft it has four combs and a draw string so you feel like its really secure...people actually thought it was my hair because it blended so well</li>
            <li> This is a great wig for natural and transitioning divas. I can wear this with my hair in it&#x27;s curly state or with a twist out (2 or 3 strand twists) I have even used the wig as a full cap and in its a pony tail option. The older the wig is the more natural looking it becomes.&lt;br /&gt;The wig arrived faster than I expected and the packaging was great.&lt;br /&gt;Now the wig can be purchased cheaper elsewhere; however with shipping costs, it will average out the same.&lt;br /&gt;WORD OF CAUTION: Every sista and her mama has this wig. I would recommend cutting this wig or trying different styles to mix it up. But then again there are a lot of people with the same straight hair...</li>
            <li> I loved this wig and wore it to death lol. If you do not like big poofy hair..this wig is not for you. As you wear it more and more...it does get bigger and has a natural look to it. Its not a wig to last you for a whole year...you can get a good 4 months out of this wig if you don&#x27;t sleep in it.</li>
            <li> I used it to wear as an updo...you can find the updo side ponytail on youtube using this wig and it worked great!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok. Took about 5 days to come &amp; when I took it out the package, it was lighter than I thought it would be. Weight wise. You definitely have to chop some off if you dont wanna look like a poodle. I cut at least 4 or 5 inches off mine to give it some shape. It&#x27;s okay for a $20 wig. The track blends in nicely as well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered the creta girl unit from this seller multiple times. I always get the correct order, the wig is always good, and it always ships fast. Thanks!</li>
            <li> i have a very small face and this wig was huge. because i am pretty good at shaping hair to fit my face i was able to make it work. i wont be purchasing this wig again</li>
            <li> I have been a long time fan of Freetress Creta Girl and it has been increasingly hard to find at my local retail beauty supply stores so I jumped for joy when I saw it listed on here. Although the tags reads &amp;#34;Creta Girl&amp;#34;, this definitely not the Creta Girl wig I have purchased throughout the years. Freetress Creta Girl used to be my GO-TO quick natural hair fix on days I was in a rush to get somewhere and still look beautiful.The previous versions were full, blended well with natural hair with little effort, and lasted a long time. I guess those days are over! The wig I received, although new and well packaged, only lasted 1 day and the quality was poor. It frizzed up very quickly and the material it&#x27;s made out of is too soft so for the first time, I have to wet my hair and use a ton of gel for it to blend well. I do not recommend this product for any one looking for something that will last more than a day or two.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t what I thought it would be. It only lasted for a couple of weeks. I didn&#x27;t put any products on the wig because it&#x27;s synthetic. I was able to &amp;#34;rehab&amp;#34; it after watching some Youtube videos but the original curls never came back. It&#x27;s better to just buy a human hair version (100%, remy) and keep it for years than to buy this synthetic, quick wig.</li>
            <li> This wig lasts about 4 weeks with proper care. I cut some length off mine. It looks natural and not wiggy.</li>
            <li> It is my fault.  I have natural hair and was hopeful that this piece would compliment my tresses.  What I did not do was match the piece to my hair type.  Therefore, it did not look very good on my head.  It was much too long for my personal taste but yet again, it looked exactly like the picture after taking a second look.  Further, it almost came off of my head as I was walking.  Yes.  I know.  I used the combs in the front but not in the back.  Maybe my head is just to large.</li>
            <li> I order this same hair piece all the time and this last time that I ordered it, it was nothing like it has been. The pony tail is flat and the curls are large and loose, not small and spirally like they normally are. Not sure if I just got a bad one after receiving really good ones, however I am disappointed that I wasted my cash on this, this time around.</li>
            <li> I was so nervous about buying a wig over the internet, but I am SO glad I did. This wig is light and hair held up great. It matched my hair perfectly and I have no regrets about buying it. Youtube helped me alot for finding styles.</li>
            <li> I honestly liked it when I first put it on my head, but when I wore it the second day it started to tangle and shed. It looked synthetic, I hated it.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t understand why anyone would leave the house wearing this thing on their head. It looked like a clown wig. I tried it once when I got it and just hated it. It&#x27;s very big and makes your head hot. Wow...I could go on and on. I was decieved by the good reviews. I can&#x27;t believe people would give it more than a &amp;#34;1&amp;#34; star. I would give it a &amp;#34;zero&amp;#34; if I could</li>
            <li> I bought Creta Girl in either Nov. or Dec. 2013 (through my husband&#x27;s Prime account) and it&#x27;s now Feb. and I can still wear it. It is probably ready to be retired or worn as a bun, but it definitely lasted a while in my opinion for synthetic hair. When I first bought it wore it off and on for about two weeks at a time. Since Jan. I have been wearing it as my everyday wig. I have gotten sooooo many compliments on this hair! At home and at work. Unless I tell people, most people think it&#x27;s my hair...it blends really well with natural hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had to cut the wig to get it where I wanted it. Not because it was too big, but because it was too long for me. Once I cut it, I was in luv! I flat twist my hair underneath and leave out enough hair to make about three medium size two-strand twists. Each night I re-twist my leave out (about three twist) and put them on flexi-rods. In the morning I put on my Creta Girl, undo my twists, arrange and pin to make it look natural, and I&#x27;m I done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I see people saying this is really big hair. I don&#x27;t really think it&#x27;s BIG hair unless you want it to be. For me it&#x27;s full hair with a lot of body. To me it has the same volume as my natural hair with I do a twist out...but I do have really thick 4b hair. Anyway, I like this wig a lot and will definitely be ordering it for the summer.</li>
            <li> This wig is great. I cut it and shaped it to my face. I cut a side bang and up to my shoulders. This wig is very long so understand you can always cut it and make it your own. The more you wear it the better it looks. After a month the ends did get alittle tangled so I trimmed it but no one can tell that this is not my hair. True to color, I&#x27;m buying another one, cant wait :)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice wig....I would like to give it 3 and a half stars really...my issue is the 1b isn&#x27;t as dark as it should be....and yes this wig GROWS lol it gets bigger and bigger so if you&#x27;re ready for some big curly bushy hair this is it!</li>
            <li> Love it! Will be ordering another one.</li>
            <li> The hair is beautiful, soft luxurious, blended well with own hair line and hair. The color was natural looking others though it was my real hair.</li>
            <li> This wig is great. If you intend to use it for a protective style it is PERFECT to say the least. I&#x27;ve ordered quite a few of this wig and i&#x27;d say on average it last about a month. Maybe longer depending on how you wear it. I wear mine in a bun, covered by my real hair and it blend so nicely and really protects my hair. I&#x27;d recommend this for a temporary style, if you want something that last for months or longer go with human hair and something more expensive.</li>
            <li> Great Half Wig, natural looking curls and would blend perfectly with a 3C curl pattern. The hair will get bigger and bigger because its curly, but all you have to do it cut it a little. Once it gets a little old it will look even more natural. You will receive compliments!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this wig after seeing it on Youtube.  One girl was able to cut it so that it wasn&#x27;t so big.  I tried this method and it just kept getting bigger and frizzier.  I never wore it out; just called it a loss.</li>
            <li> The curls looked really nice but the hair had this foul odor when I got it. I really hope it will go away eventually or after I use some products on it.</li>
            <li> I love this wig but did not realize it was so long.  I will take it to a beauty shop to have it trimmed down, which I believe is all I need so I can start wearing it. The hair is very light, fluffy and big.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend others to buy it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve just received \\&quot;Creta Girl\\&quot; and right out of the box I could tell this was the perfect wig for me.  I&#x27;ve been natural for about 12 years now and wanted something I could blend with my own natural texture. Most of the other wigs I&#x27;ve seen look a little \\&quot;jerry curl-ish\\&quot; or too shiny so when I placed the wig on my head just to see what I was working with, it looked like it was my hair.  Can&#x27;t wait to really play with it and blend it with my hair.  I see why some girls purchase multiple units. Very happy with this purchase and would recommend it to anyone looking for a more \\&quot;natural\\&quot; look.</li>
            <li> Ive purchased this wig before, its always been a favoriote. This curly wig is a must for the summer! The consumer also ships fast, overall no problems here</li>
            <li> Love it! Perfect protective style and the older it gets the better and more natural it looks. About to order another just to have!</li>
            <li> The product came in a timely manner.  In 2 days w/ expected time of 5-7 days! The wig is very natural looking. Only thing..the curl is a lot bigger than I thought it would be. I thought it would be about a half inch or less in diameter. .but its more like an inch. So the overall look wasn&#x27;t what I expected.  It&#x27;s a lotttt of hair but i like big hair. I had to lightly layer to fit my face of course. Other than that, you can blend it easily &amp; I lasted for 2 weeks looking better with age.</li>
            <li> After seeing Creta Girl reviews on Youtube, I decided to buy one to see what the hype was all about.  OMG...I completely LOVE..LOVE this wig! I purchased the 1B color and it blended so well with my own hair.  I just wish there was a way to make this wig last longer.  It&#x27;s going on a month and the wig is still looking good, of course with the help of wig spray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just bought the 1B/33.  That color is a perfect match for my hair color; however, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s as full as the 1B.  Maybe over time it will fill out more.  But, at the end of the day, it was worth the $27.94 w/SH&amp;Txs. I love my Creta Girls; they&#x27;re the BOMB!</li>
            <li> Love this wig. Arrived very quickly and I get a lot of compliments when I wear it. Just as described on website with regards to packaging and quality.</li>
