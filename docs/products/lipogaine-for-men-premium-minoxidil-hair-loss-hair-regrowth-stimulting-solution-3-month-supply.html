            <li>Great product and works</li>
            <li>For front thinning or balding I have noticed great improvement.</li>
            <li>The product is always shipped fasted on time and packaged great.</li>
            <li>Let me start off by saying that this product is not as effective as many of the people have claimed it to be!!!  </li>
            <li>and you can style your hair very nicely.</li>
            <li>Works great  good product</li>
            <li>Great product good results</li>
            <li>Outstanding product best on the market today.</li>
            <li>so I decided to follow the best reviews and the most favorable research recommendations.</li>
            <li>This stuff has been really great for me, and when I moved to Berlin for a year and stopped using it, I lost SO much more hair!  </li>
            <li>This is a good product.</li>
            <li>Good product...</li>
            <li>I wash my hair with Nizoral, then use a good conditioner.</li>
            <li>Takes time but with a good DHT supplement  like NuHAIR</li>
            <li>I could not be more pleased and impressed.  </li>
            <li>That is very cheap and works great as well.</li>
            <li>Oils are very healthy, but what u need to know is that if you leave it on for a while, it will clog ur hair follicles and cause hair loss.</li>
            <li>Been very pleased with the results and product.  </li>
            <li>am using this  product for 3 months now and I am very pleased with it.</li>
            <li>Works great at the front of the hairline and the top.</li>
            <li>By the end of 6 months, I have seen amazing result.</li>
            <li>They contain great ingredients and are an important part of anyone&#x27;s regimen.</li>
            <li>Amazing stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Company also cares and has reached out which is nice to see.</li>
            <li>I received a letter from Lipogaine asking me to write a Honest product review for a 3 month supply as a thank you from the company.</li>
            <li>Honestly this product has worked effectively in my case.</li>
            <li>Lipogane to work effectively MUST be used with a micro-needle derma roller.</li>
            <li>Took a 2 months to see results and almost gave up after significant shredding but kept with it and great results.</li>
            <li>Excellent product and highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Best product ever for new hair growth and fullness.</li>
            <li>all the best and good luck getting your hair back.</li>
            <li>My husband has been using this product on his hairline for almost two years now and has had great success with it.  </li>
            <li>The combination of ingredients proved to be more effective than that of Rogaine which I had used for years.</li>
            <li>It also seems to be effective on most of my scalp.</li>
            <li>The best product by far</li>
            <li>I once had in my teens, I&#x27;m so happy to still have a head full of healthy hair.  </li>
            <li>Strongly recommended for us boys with bald genes!</li>
            <li>The numbers are not on your side so my advice is dont give your money until they have invested time into creating a more substantial product that will guarantee that you get your money&#x27;s worth.&lt;br /&gt;With</li>
            <li>As you can tell by the ingredients, as well as using it, it&#x27;s a more comprehensive product.</li>
            <li>I have achieved better results than by solely using Rogaine.</li>
            <li>Even though they&#x27;re both marketed at 5% minoxidil, I believe this is more potent.</li>
            <li>Much better then</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t write many reviews</li>
            <li>I have suffered from traction alopecia for many years.</li>
            <li>But in September 2014, I started taking better hair care, by using oil but not leaving it on and caring for my hair when taking a shower.</li>
            <li>Even though I had reduced my stress level and took better care</li>
            <li>So all in all, in about 2 months I have had results which for me are more than what I could&#x27;ve asked for.</li>
            <li>and I can tell it slowed my hairloss and helped cover the front area where most of my hairloss is.</li>
            <li>It was most noticeable in the crown area, but also thinning elsewhere.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m definitely pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not some magical miracle product, but it is going to be better than not using anything.</li>
            <li>and I was even contemplating more drastic measures.</li>
            <li>Better than Rogaine for sure.</li>
            <li>However, now I seem to be having more like 10 again.</li>
            <li>Neither of them worked any better than Rogaine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>We are both VERY happy with the results and would most definitely recommend this product for combating hair loss.</li>
            <li>I like this product much better than rogain minoxidil, mostly because it doesn&#x27;t make my scalp too greasy.</li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>but i need a bit more time for better results</li>
            <li>area.&lt;br /&gt;Now, after about a year of using it, I can tell for sure that is working.</li>
            <li>And I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li>glad I found this product and gave it a try.</li>
            <li>I have however been able to keep all the remaining hairs and haven&#x27;t noticed any shedding.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m hopeful that even more hair will grow because when I massage my scalp, I can feel the baby hairs that weren&#x27;t there before.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will try to update with more results.</li>
            <li>but im seeing the best result ever my hair used to fall out about 30 to 40 in a day but now tnx to Allah only like 5 to 10 .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Like anything that works this well, give it a month or two to really see the great results.</li>
            <li>Will buy over and over again because my hair looks better and fuller now than when I was 25.</li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t ask for a better product.</li>
            <li>And, as I get more hair and grow it longer, I have more options to style and cut</li>
            <li>Hopefully my results will get better.</li>
            <li>The patch is the back is filling in at an excellent rate after just five months.</li>
            <li>I have been buying this product for many years now.</li>
            <li>I can tell that, comparing to other minoxidil brands I tried, this one is the most I liked in the terms I have just mentioned, and I consider it as the best quality.</li>
            <li>Lipogaine is a great product and I would highly recommend it to any men out there with thinning/losing hair.</li>
            <li>It is also a great alternative to hair gel or hair cream to style your hair and keep it in place all day while growing new hair.  </li>
            <li>Lipogaine dries more like a paste and doesn&#x27;t smell as strong.</li>
            <li>Had used rogaine foam for a number of years, which was okay, probably slowed hair loss, but lipogaine definitely is superior in that it did cause a decent amount of regrowth in the vertex, and regrowth at corners which rogaine hadn&#x27;t done in its many years of use.</li>
            <li>Let me start by saying that I am more than pleasantly surprised by the results I&#x27;ve experienced in using this product.</li>
            <li>Very effective and easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;You will see new hair growth after 3-months treatments!</li>
            <li>then you&#x27;ll be fine to apply your favorite styling product.  </li>
            <li>Its great product for complete hair hair problems.</li>
            <li>It dries so fast, and it leaves your hair in a good shape after.</li>
            <li>This is the best minoxidil because it doesn&#x27;t get greasy like the other ones with the dropper.</li>
            <li>I would be super excited if Lipogaine ever came in a foam, but until then I&#x27;m going to keep trucking with the liquid kind.  </li>
            <li>My head of hair is fuller and the hair is strong.</li>
            <li>Definitely the best minoxidil out in the market right now</li>
            <li>It was a huge self esteem crusher.</li>
            <li>I totally recommend this product and happy</li>
            <li>I feel extremely fortunate to have battled alopecia and won.  </li>
            <li>and it was really cheap</li>
            <li>Kava has been fantastic for me, it has eliminated a lot of my anxiety and helps me to relax at night.</li>
            <li>wonders would recommend to anyone who wants to regrowth their hair back excellent product would recommend to anyone having hair loss issues ,but just be patient like I was and the result will soon show.</li>
            <li>Ok I usually don&#x27;t right reviews.</li>
            <li>I went to a dermatologist and he said I have a healthy head, and my skin was healthy and all my blood works came normal.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve effectively stopped loosing hair and am beginning to see decent regrowth, to the point where friend and family have notice.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found the best method is to use 1/2 dose of each, no more headaches.</li>
            <li>That is when I started noticing a significant improvement in the thickness of my hair.</li>
            <li>I think this product is great and helps at keeping the hair that I have with some minor regrowth too.</li>
            <li>Since I decided to just stick it out with Lipogaine about 6 months ago, my usage has been more consistent (almost always twice a day).</li>
            <li>originally was using Kirkland minoxidil foam</li>
            <li>, you need to consistently use it and not stop, otherwise your hair will start falling out more than it was before.  </li>
            <li>Even when applying once a day, my shedding reduced significantly within 3 months</li>
            <li>I have tried other brands, but this is the absolute best.</li>
            <li>I also take special vitamins.  </li>
            <li>You are not going to grow a full head of hair in 3 months -</li>
            <li>Fast forward to age 35, while I would love to have kept the lion mane</li>
            <li>I am not saying that my hair was as full as when I was 20s</li>
            <li>I love that lipogaine is straight up liquid.</li>
            <li>Thankfully, in my case, it has maintained my hairline and allowed the hair on my crown to regrow to full concealment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s true if u have 1 bald spot.but</li>
            <li>Still need more months to tell if it really works in regrowing hair or not.</li>
            <li>but it has thinned out over time - as in Im now in my mid 50,s but still have a good head of hair.</li>
            <li>as far as topical minoxidil formulas, this may be the best thing going right now.</li>
            <li>As others noted, this is one the best minoxidil formula out there: not messy or greasy and doesn&#x27;t make your scalp dry or itchy.</li>
            <li>I am fortunate to have started out with the right products (based on research) and don&#x27;t plan on changing anything at all.</li>
            <li>Also take Biotin 10,000mcg, super collagen dietary supplement, use emu oil and also organic apple cider vinegar (w/ mother)</li>
            <li>I have tried several different minoxidil products and found this one to be the best.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t recommend it enough to those going through the same problem I am (the Lipogaine DHT blocking shampoo is wonderful too).</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, if any of you expect a quick result, don&#x27;t bother.</li>
            <li>overall, definitely the best hair loss treatment i have used.  </li>
            <li>I am completely satisfied with Lipogaine and highly recommend it to anyone concerned about hair</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m confident that my six month update will prove the thinning stage will be transformed into normal hair growth.</li>
            <li>I used some other minoxidil products; I can say that this is the best hair lost product i have used so far.</li>
            <li>so it is too early to give a honest positive review of the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product</li>
            <li>The only reason I tried this was because of the amazing reviews people left.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have to say it doesn&#x27;t help hair grow back but does seem to be effective in slowing the thinning process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Have used the product for several months now, and though the results are incredible yet, there are definite improvements and I will continue to use the product and recommend others to try it as well.</li>
            <li>This will allow all the minoxidil to be absorbed.</li>
            <li>In a moment of poor judgment, I used a best selling man&#x27;s hair coloring.  </li>
            <li>to be clear, I use to see more than 10 hairs on my pillow every morning, after 2 months of use I see just 1 or 2 max..</li>
            <li>I found Lipogaine and decided that $25 a month is not a lot of money and will certainly be worth it if it did work.</li>
            <li>For me it was worth it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Itches a bit, but its worth it for the results.</li>
            <li>Worth a try anyway</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>It was worth going for Lipogaine.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried the foams also and feel like they aren&#x27;t as effective and dry out too quickly.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s right, even if I don&#x27;t shampoo, I always use their solution.</li>
            <li>Because it has DHT blocker and vitamins that keep those follicles open, it clearly is more effective than regular Rogaine.  </li>
            <li>Great product but really small bottles</li>
            <li>I started noticing around that same time that my face was developing very fine peach fuzz like a baby’s skin</li>
            <li>Although their prices are higher, I find the better quality to be worth the extra money.</li>
            <li>Fast and discrete delivery!</li>
            <li>God bless ;)</li>
            <li>before taking a shower if u plan on using minoxidil first and then taking a shower.</li>
            <li>Way better than regular minoxidil!</li>
            <li>They make your hair and nails grow fast!</li>
            <li>Must admit that this product works very well beside the fact that the shedding period is quite long, I did panic to be honest but Lipogaine kept its promise,</li>
            <li>containing minoxidil needs to first realize that the process of re-growing hair is long-term.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for several years, and I&#x27;m satisfied with the results.</li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m convinced that consistent use of this product along with supplementation has helped stem the tide of more drastic hair loss for me.</li>
            <li>I have been using Lipogain for Men for 2 years and it corrected my hair loss within the first month and has maintained and improved my hair since.  </li>
            <li>My son has seen great progress and has the intention to continue the use of Lipogaine as long as possible</li>
            <li>(Ofcourse make sure your hairloss isn&#x27;t health related)</li>
            <li>definitely made the hair on top of my head thicker and improved my hairline somewhat.</li>
            <li>and I am very thankful for that!</li>
            <li>it 2 months, be consistent with it, and you&#x27;ll see results.  </li>
            <li>You won&#x27;t see any difference for the first three months but it will happen.</li>
            <li>Well, this stuff has worked pretty well for me.</li>
            <li>I mixed it with powdered Azaleic Acid and is working much better.</li>
            <li>Just like many of you, I have tried various products in a quite consistent manner.</li>
            <li>hairs.today was his first day using lipogaine</li>
            <li>I would only recommend using it with the Micro needle too for even better results.  </li>
            <li>I definitely like it better than minoxidil by itself.</li>
            <li>I took photos of my head when I started and took some more just recently.</li>
            <li>I noticed results after about the first 3 months when it seemed my hair stopped falling out and baby hairs were noticeable.</li>
            <li>I noticed the mild bald patches had new hair growth.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if its new hair or my current hair is thicker, but my crown area where you could easily see my scalp, ESPECIALLY IN SUNLIGHT OR LIGHTED AREAS, is honestly gone.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve been using generic 5% minoxidil from Rite Aid and Kirkland for years and always felt it was just barely good enough.</li>
            <li>make sure you try it  for at least 6 months before making any decisions and compliment it with plenty of healthy food.</li>
            <li>I completely understand and recognize its efficacy, however i believe it should be priced more at around $20 per bottle the most for the company to see a major switch from regular minoxidil to Lipogaine.</li>
            <li>you willing to invest that much on something that can not guarantee its use.&lt;br</li>
            <li>my hairline was pretty much non-existent.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really see any results the first two months.</li>
            <li>and then it pretty much went away.</li>
            <li>So it&#x27;s a pretty a much life-time dedication.  </li>
            <li>so far the product seems to be working and seems to work quickly.</li>
            <li>Just make sure to apply on dry hair</li>
            <li>did arrive well packaged and very quickly from supplier and will definitely use them again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This product does not leave any obvious residue on your hair, making it easy to use twice a day.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve  used Lipogaine on the front area where is this visible bald spot on the right side and that area has become fuller since using Lipogaine and there&#x27;s even new growth in and just to the front of the border that my hairline had receded to.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but, I honestly use it all over (cause I&#x27;m thinning all over) and when I first started using I noticed little hairs sprouting in my front hairline within 1 month!</li>
            <li>and it really helps.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend Lipogaine!</li>
            <li>Thanks again &#x27;hairloss from steroids&#x27;</li>
            <li>It took about 4-6 months of use but there was noticeable improvement in the crown area, not as much around the temples.  </li>
            <li>The drugstore minoxidil didn&#x27;t seem to help much</li>
            <li>I have so much volume.</li>
            <li>I can really notice by just putting a comb through my hair; almost always a couple flakes turn up.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t know.</li>
            <li>Much faster drying than Kirkland</li>
            <li>and Lipogaine really works for the front as well).  </li>
            <li>OK so let me  start off by saying this product is definitely more expensive than alternative minoxidil formulations, BUT it&#x27;s actually really worth it.</li>
            <li>The &amp;#34;extra&amp;#34; ingredients have really helped.</li>
            <li>My scalp used to burn up and get really itchy.</li>
            <li>and I also really struggled spreading the foam around.</li>
            <li>Really wish it worked for me, but no go.</li>
            <li>Held what hair I had but did not regrow much, seed to slow/</li>
            <li>/&gt;Thanks Lipogaine for putting together a product that really works.</li>
            <li>I feel my hair is much stronger than before.</li>
            <li>but that wasn&#x27;t very helpful to me.</li>
            <li>Both worked on my hair in terms of regrowth, but made it appear very sticky or even made my hair have whitish flakes.</li>
            <li>product has light yellow color.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really say that I saw much improvement on the front line</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s not simply thin wispy hairs.  </li>
            <li>Before I had to keep my hair very short in order not to accentuate my thinning, but now I can go to a barber and enjoy getting an undercut done.</li>
            <li>This is a really powerful substance for hair growth, it&#x27;s so powerful that it actually grows your eyebrow bushy</li>
            <li>I tried other 5% minoxidils but certainly this one works better for me.</li>
            <li>The trick is to get it early, and use the right product(s).</li>
            <li>This product is way better than other brands that just have minoxidil since Lipogaine has ingredients to stop DHT from acumulating in the hair follices (DHT makes hair thinner and kills the follicles).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The dark shadow was hair that was just growing and the combination of the two products was magic.  </li>
            <li>Only one in my family with a full head of hair</li>
            <li>and I experience less hair falling, while seeing a &#x27;fuzz&#x27; appearing - mainly on the crown area - and darkening into good hair in the future.  </li>
            <li>I really wish to find a way to keep my new grown hair without having it fall out if I stop using this product...</li>
            <li>Easy to use and absolutely no side effects for me.</li>
            <li>this is much better than your standard minoxidil products  such as rogaine .</li>
            <li>At first, I would usually have about 10 or more hairs on my finger after I applied the product.</li>
            <li>I tried so many different types of products but none of them seemed to actually help to regrow hair on the scalp.</li>
            <li>and it works noticeably better then when I used Kirkland 5% minoxidal only, especially in the front area where I now have hair regrowth.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s steadily getting thicker and darker too.  </li>
            <li>I will keep using it along with Lipogaine big 3 Shampoo for 6 more months and make my final judgment after.</li>
            <li>This product worked better than I had hoped and I encourage anyone to give it a try before resorting to riskier or more expensive solutions.</li>
            <li>haven’t experienced any itchiness or redness of the scalp only some minor shedding which is expected at this</li>
            <li>On account of this experience, I highly recommend this product and will continue to use it myself.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend trying this product.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend this brand over rogaine and kirkland after trying them all</li>
            <li>For anyone who is concerned about a receding hairline, I HIGHLY recommend you use this.</li>
            <li>It is far superior to anything I have used in the past and believe you me I have spent many years &amp; 1000&#x27;s of $ on trying different hair regrowth products.</li>
            <li>Now I have my hair for a little while longer :)</li>
            <li>you just have to keep looking and pay a little more.</li>
            <li>I began using Rogaine early on which did seem to halt the hair loss, however it seemed as if my hair had become acclimated and wasn&#x27;t showing much progress</li>
            <li>I was using it for both the top of my head and the crown area and all i could harvest was peach fuzz and a few hair strings.</li>
            <li>Lipogaine after only 5 months is showing exciting results.  </li>
            <li>I even tried hair, skin, and nail tablets, but all my vitamin and mineral levels were normal.</li>
            <li>ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used a drugstore brand of minoxidil for years with moderate success.</li>
            <li>One thing though has pretty much stopped all side effects is adding their big 3 shampoo.</li>
            <li>; regimen strictly is because if I miss once, I can feel some tension on my scalp, probably due to my hair follicles being filled up with DHT and all the garbage that DHT brings in.</li>
            <li>does not itch the scalp or cause dandruff/flaking as much as other brands i used previously, and seems to be more effective in preventing hairline recession (my biggest problem area) than other brands.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t gone through the shedding phase that&#x27;s supposed to precede the regrowth phase, where the hair stops falling out and new ones supposedly grow in stronger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It did not regrow much new hair</li>
            <li>I have not regrown any new hair, but that has been the case with anything I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>That area has become fuller since using Lipogaine and there&#x27;s even new growth in and just to the front of the border that my hairline had receded to.  </li>
            <li>The product does leave a residue but after a few days you can just rinse it out, or if you live on the coast like me then just go for a swim in the ocean to clear your scalp or better still rinse with some apple cider vinegar.</li>
            <li>My friend a few years back told me about this product as he had used it and liked it.  </li>
            <li>Will admit I was discouraged at the 3 month point when I saw very little progress but stuck at it and am glad I did.</li>
            <li>Let me make this clear!</li>
            <li>Better than the other name brands or generic drug store stuff.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t usually write reviews, and after using this product, I feel like I should write more often.  </li>
            <li>This solution works, but only for those who are consistent in using the solution.</li>
            <li>If you get the hair growth you were after and stop, I&#x27;m told it will revert back to as if you never used it in the first place.  .  </li>
            <li>The bottles recommend twice a day 8 hours minimum between application, but I only use it once a day, sometimes I miss a day or two straight, still working!</li>
            <li>I have been extremely satisfied with this product, which I have been using for the past year.</li>
            <li>In the first week of using it, my scalp was very itchy due to the propylglycene which is normal.</li>
            <li>My hair on both sides of my head was smooth down to the skin bald except for a few stray fine hairs.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used any other product in the past, but I did a lot of looking on the subject for what we could put on our scalps that would work the best.</li>
            <li>In fact, I only really noticed it very early on</li>
            <li>Been using the product for over 3 years now, significantly slowed down frontal hair thinning.</li>
            <li>My first impression on this product is that it dries much faster than other brands.  </li>
            <li>the way Go away grey its for ur hair to go back to its original colour but</li>
            <li>Lipogaine comes out the clear winner of the three.</li>
            <li>By the third month, my hair loss was completely stopped and I started to notice my hair was much thicker than before in the vertex area.</li>
            <li>, quite obvious when it would dry clean</li>
            <li>I have been using this product in combination with the micro needle and So far this product has been working  </li>
            <li>I have the hairline I had when I was 7 years old.</li>
            <li>The light brown color turned to a green hue when used with this product.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really regrow hair, just seemed to maintain what I had left.</li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t have much left to lose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used a couple different minoxidil products since I started losing my hair several years ago, and none have really amounted to anything promising.</li>
            <li>It really does work and not just in the back but all over my head</li>
            <li>What I noticed are the following: The crown has stopped loosing hair and is slowly reversing the process but more amazingly it is the hairline that is returning to look just like when i was in my late teens.</li>
            <li>Do not waste time, and do yourself a favor buying Lipogaine.</li>
            <li>Overall this is a very quality Kava  at an unbeatable price.</li>
            <li>No side effects so far.</li>
            <li>early point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>25 Years old, noticed thinning</li>
            <li>Also is making my beard much thicker and increased chest &amp; back hair since using it.  .  </li>
            <li>(I am in early 30s).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve got considerable restoral in that area</li>
            <li>As of now, I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s a product that hasn&#x27;t done for me what it&#x27;s claimed to do for others, but I&#x27;ll play the waiting game in hopes that it just takes more time given that the side effects are very tolerable.</li>
            <li>The derma roller allows the Minoxidil solution to be absorbed at roughly 10x the rate it would without it</li>
            <li>Although more expensive than the competitors, the cosmetic difference is worth it in my opinion.</li>
            <li>After trying this product, I didn&#x27;t notice the change right away, but after a few months I could really tell the difference.</li>
            <li>This is all after only 3 months, which isn&#x27;t very long  into Lipogaine&#x27;s full effectiveness.</li>
            <li>Apparently the Lipogaine has been working and the Folicure thickened the new growth.</li>
            <li>Be patient as it will take a few months before you see significant results.  </li>
            <li>I did a considerable amount of research before starting out and found that others had given high marks to Lipogaine for Men.</li>
            <li>At this price most people will seriously consider its counterpart since at this pricepoint they can purchase a 6 months minoxidil supply vs 1 Lipogaine bottle.</li>
            <li>think again its full of vitamins for your hair and in the long run your hair never turns grey and it makes ur hair thicker aswel .</li>
            <li>I have enough hair now that I actually have to be concerned about styling it every morning for the first time in years.</li>
            <li>I also highly recommend checking out Lipogaine Big 3 Shampoo, L&#x27;Oreal Paris EverStrong Thickening Shampoo and Conditioner.</li>
            <li>I definitely recommend using a high quality shampoo with Lipogaine to reduce dandruff and stiffness.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m currently 25 and after a few months the crown is full of hair again!</li>
            <li>One more thing, it dries quickly, doesn&#x27;t smell, even though I&#x27;m allergic to PG and itches like crazy at times, I&#x27;ll continue on using it.</li>
            <li>My hairline was about 2 inches back from its normal place.</li>
            <li>I see brand new hair growth all over, especially in the receding area.</li>
            <li>It does not smell, dries much faster than regular minoxidil, and does not cause itchiness as the regular minoxidil products do either.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s all coming back now slowly but surely.  </li>
            <li>That created the need to wear wigs because I had no other alternative.</li>
            <li>The odd part is that I&#x27;m seeing faster hair regrowth on the right hand side of my receding hairline.</li>
            <li>However, I did not notice much difference since it was not really hair loss but a cycle of losing hair and new hair growing back which you can research.</li>
            <li>Now it’s not thick man hair, but seriously having a hairy face is not close to cool.</li>
            <li>So, I highly recommend Lipogaine for Men and I definitely suggest that you use it in unison with the Lipogaine Big 3 Shampoo.</li>
            <li>This is a Fixed formula with a key ingredient called minoxidil.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a 34 year old male</li>
            <li>I started using Lipogaine in my early 30&#x27;s when I began to notice moderate thinning around the crown and temple areas.</li>
            <li>finally decided to try lipogaine as it has additional natural DHT ingredients in it.</li>
            <li>I am in the early stages of thinning and this stuff has definitely thickened my hair.</li>
            <li>You might not even need the full 1ml dose required if your thinning hair area is small.</li>
            <li>wished that I had tried lipogaine a few years earlier so my hair would be as full as when I was 20s by now.</li>
            <li>I have been having hair loss problems due to genetic issues and had lost a large amount of hair.</li>
            <li>And make sure ur hands r dry too, and also wait at least 2 hrs.</li>
            <li>So far so good, even with a bad diet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After combining the topical solution with the Big 3 shampoo, I have noticed that the my hair completely stops shedding altogether, nothing on my fingers when i run my hands through my hair in the shower.</li>
            <li>i apply with a Qtip once daily and could apply to the more thin areas twice per day.</li>
            <li>In 6 month i have spent close to $500 or more because it takes at least 2 bottles to apply in a month (twice daily).</li>
            <li>The only CON I can think of regarding Minoxidil in general is, it&#x27;s a life time commitment.</li>
            <li>Other than that, I didn&#x27;t notice much difference until the end of the second month.</li>
            <li>However, if a medical product is not guaranteed to work on a large scale of the population then it is not worth the risk.</li>
            <li>Other products make my hair dry and crisp</li>
            <li>many other reviews, the only negative about this product is that it says it&#x27;s a 1month supply, for me</li>
            <li>far as side effects are concerned, the itchy scalp is very minor for me.</li>
            <li>We started noticing new growth less than a month after he started using it and within about 3-6 months, his hairline had come forward at least an inch and filled in dramatically.  </li>
            <li>I noticed a difference at first, shortly after using it, but it was not until a few months later when I stopped using it for about a month because of surgery I had done.</li>
            <li>Secondly, if u take a shower dry your hair completely and wait atleast 10 min before using minoxidil, both lipogaine and Costco brand</li>
            <li>I liked to keep my hair long because I could cover spots where my hair was very thin</li>
            <li>After few months of using, I can definitely see the positive results and would recommend it.</li>
            <li>I used several different brands of straight 5% minxoidil for half a year.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Let me start off by saying that this product is not as effective as many of the people have claimed it to be!!!  </li>
            <li> and you can style your hair very nicely.</li>

            <li> Great product good results</li>
            <li> Outstanding product best on the market today.</li>
            <li> so I decided to follow the best reviews and the most favorable research recommendations.</li>
            <li> This stuff has been really great for me, and when I moved to Berlin for a year and stopped using it, I lost SO much more hair!  </li>
            <li> This is a good product.</li>
            <li> Good product...</li>
            <li> I wash my hair with Nizoral, then use a good conditioner.</li>
            <li> Takes time but with a good DHT supplement  like NuHAIR</li>
            <li> I could not be more pleased and impressed.  </li>
            <li> That is very cheap and works great as well.</li>
            <li> Oils are very healthy, but what u need to know is that if you leave it on for a while, it will clog ur hair follicles and cause hair loss.</li>
            <li> Been very pleased with the results and product.  </li>
            <li> am using this  product for 3 months now and I am very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> Works great at the front of the hairline and the top.</li>
            <li> By the end of 6 months, I have seen amazing result.</li>
            <li> They contain great ingredients and are an important part of anyone&#x27;s regimen.</li>
            <li> Amazing stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Company also cares and has reached out which is nice to see.</li>
            <li> I received a letter from Lipogaine asking me to write a Honest product review for a 3 month supply as a thank you from the company.</li>
            <li> Honestly this product has worked effectively in my case.</li>
            <li> Lipogane to work effectively MUST be used with a micro-needle derma roller.</li>
            <li> Took a 2 months to see results and almost gave up after significant shredding but kept with it and great results.</li>
            <li> Excellent product and highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Best product ever for new hair growth and fullness.</li>
            <li> all the best and good luck getting your hair back.</li>
            <li> My husband has been using this product on his hairline for almost two years now and has had great success with it.  </li>
            <li> The combination of ingredients proved to be more effective than that of Rogaine which I had used for years.</li>
            <li> It also seems to be effective on most of my scalp.</li>
            <li> The best product by far</li>
            <li> I once had in my teens, I&#x27;m so happy to still have a head full of healthy hair.  </li>
            <li> Strongly recommended for us boys with bald genes!</li>
            <li> The numbers are not on your side so my advice is dont give your money until they have invested time into creating a more substantial product that will guarantee that you get your money&#x27;s worth.&lt;br /&gt;With</li>
            <li> As you can tell by the ingredients, as well as using it, it&#x27;s a more comprehensive product.</li>
            <li> I have achieved better results than by solely using Rogaine.</li>
            <li> Even though they&#x27;re both marketed at 5% minoxidil, I believe this is more potent.</li>
            <li> Much better then</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t write many reviews</li>
            <li> I have suffered from traction alopecia for many years.</li>
            <li> But in September 2014, I started taking better hair care, by using oil but not leaving it on and caring for my hair when taking a shower.</li>
            <li> Even though I had reduced my stress level and took better care</li>
            <li> So all in all, in about 2 months I have had results which for me are more than what I could&#x27;ve asked for.</li>
            <li> and I can tell it slowed my hairloss and helped cover the front area where most of my hairloss is.</li>
            <li> It was most noticeable in the crown area, but also thinning elsewhere.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m definitely pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not some magical miracle product, but it is going to be better than not using anything.</li>
            <li> and I was even contemplating more drastic measures.</li>
            <li> Better than Rogaine for sure.</li>
            <li> However, now I seem to be having more like 10 again.</li>
            <li> Neither of them worked any better than Rogaine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> We are both VERY happy with the results and would most definitely recommend this product for combating hair loss.</li>
            <li> I like this product much better than rogain minoxidil, mostly because it doesn&#x27;t make my scalp too greasy.</li>
            <li> okay</li>
            <li> but i need a bit more time for better results</li>
            <li> area.&lt;br /&gt;Now, after about a year of using it, I can tell for sure that is working.</li>
            <li> And I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li> glad I found this product and gave it a try.</li>
            <li> I have however been able to keep all the remaining hairs and haven&#x27;t noticed any shedding.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hopeful that even more hair will grow because when I massage my scalp, I can feel the baby hairs that weren&#x27;t there before.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will try to update with more results.</li>
            <li> but im seeing the best result ever my hair used to fall out about 30 to 40 in a day but now tnx to Allah only like 5 to 10 .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Like anything that works this well, give it a month or two to really see the great results.</li>
            <li> Will buy over and over again because my hair looks better and fuller now than when I was 25.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t ask for a better product.</li>
            <li> And, as I get more hair and grow it longer, I have more options to style and cut</li>
            <li> Hopefully my results will get better.</li>
            <li> The patch is the back is filling in at an excellent rate after just five months.</li>
            <li> I have been buying this product for many years now.</li>
            <li> I can tell that, comparing to other minoxidil brands I tried, this one is the most I liked in the terms I have just mentioned, and I consider it as the best quality.</li>
            <li> Lipogaine is a great product and I would highly recommend it to any men out there with thinning/losing hair.</li>
            <li> It is also a great alternative to hair gel or hair cream to style your hair and keep it in place all day while growing new hair.  </li>
            <li> Lipogaine dries more like a paste and doesn&#x27;t smell as strong.</li>
            <li> Had used rogaine foam for a number of years, which was okay, probably slowed hair loss, but lipogaine definitely is superior in that it did cause a decent amount of regrowth in the vertex, and regrowth at corners which rogaine hadn&#x27;t done in its many years of use.</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying that I am more than pleasantly surprised by the results I&#x27;ve experienced in using this product.</li>
            <li> Very effective and easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;You will see new hair growth after 3-months treatments!</li>
            <li> then you&#x27;ll be fine to apply your favorite styling product.  </li>
            <li> Its great product for complete hair hair problems.</li>
            <li> It dries so fast, and it leaves your hair in a good shape after.</li>
            <li> This is the best minoxidil because it doesn&#x27;t get greasy like the other ones with the dropper.</li>
            <li> I would be super excited if Lipogaine ever came in a foam, but until then I&#x27;m going to keep trucking with the liquid kind.  </li>
            <li> My head of hair is fuller and the hair is strong.</li>
            <li> Definitely the best minoxidil out in the market right now</li>
            <li> It was a huge self esteem crusher.</li>
            <li> I totally recommend this product and happy</li>
            <li> I feel extremely fortunate to have battled alopecia and won.  </li>
            <li> and it was really cheap</li>
            <li> Kava has been fantastic for me, it has eliminated a lot of my anxiety and helps me to relax at night.</li>
            <li> wonders would recommend to anyone who wants to regrowth their hair back excellent product would recommend to anyone having hair loss issues ,but just be patient like I was and the result will soon show.</li>
            <li> Ok I usually don&#x27;t right reviews.</li>
            <li> I went to a dermatologist and he said I have a healthy head, and my skin was healthy and all my blood works came normal.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve effectively stopped loosing hair and am beginning to see decent regrowth, to the point where friend and family have notice.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found the best method is to use 1/2 dose of each, no more headaches.</li>
            <li> That is when I started noticing a significant improvement in the thickness of my hair.</li>
            <li> I think this product is great and helps at keeping the hair that I have with some minor regrowth too.</li>
            <li> Since I decided to just stick it out with Lipogaine about 6 months ago, my usage has been more consistent (almost always twice a day).</li>
            <li> originally was using Kirkland minoxidil foam</li>
            <li> , you need to consistently use it and not stop, otherwise your hair will start falling out more than it was before.  </li>
            <li> Even when applying once a day, my shedding reduced significantly within 3 months</li>
            <li> I have tried other brands, but this is the absolute best.</li>
            <li> I also take special vitamins.  </li>
            <li> You are not going to grow a full head of hair in 3 months -</li>
            <li> Fast forward to age 35, while I would love to have kept the lion mane</li>
            <li> I am not saying that my hair was as full as when I was 20s</li>
            <li> I love that lipogaine is straight up liquid.</li>
            <li> Thankfully, in my case, it has maintained my hairline and allowed the hair on my crown to regrow to full concealment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s true if u have 1 bald spot.but</li>
            <li> Still need more months to tell if it really works in regrowing hair or not.</li>
            <li> but it has thinned out over time - as in Im now in my mid 50,s but still have a good head of hair.</li>
            <li> as far as topical minoxidil formulas, this may be the best thing going right now.</li>
            <li> As others noted, this is one the best minoxidil formula out there: not messy or greasy and doesn&#x27;t make your scalp dry or itchy.</li>
            <li> I am fortunate to have started out with the right products (based on research) and don&#x27;t plan on changing anything at all.</li>
            <li> Also take Biotin 10,000mcg, super collagen dietary supplement, use emu oil and also organic apple cider vinegar (w/ mother)</li>
            <li> I have tried several different minoxidil products and found this one to be the best.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t recommend it enough to those going through the same problem I am (the Lipogaine DHT blocking shampoo is wonderful too).</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, if any of you expect a quick result, don&#x27;t bother.</li>
            <li> overall, definitely the best hair loss treatment i have used.  </li>
            <li> I am completely satisfied with Lipogaine and highly recommend it to anyone concerned about hair</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m confident that my six month update will prove the thinning stage will be transformed into normal hair growth.</li>
            <li> I used some other minoxidil products; I can say that this is the best hair lost product i have used so far.</li>
            <li> so it is too early to give a honest positive review of the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product</li>
            <li> The only reason I tried this was because of the amazing reviews people left.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have to say it doesn&#x27;t help hair grow back but does seem to be effective in slowing the thinning process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Have used the product for several months now, and though the results are incredible yet, there are definite improvements and I will continue to use the product and recommend others to try it as well.</li>
            <li> This will allow all the minoxidil to be absorbed.</li>
            <li> In a moment of poor judgment, I used a best selling man&#x27;s hair coloring.  </li>
            <li> to be clear, I use to see more than 10 hairs on my pillow every morning, after 2 months of use I see just 1 or 2 max..</li>
            <li> I found Lipogaine and decided that $25 a month is not a lot of money and will certainly be worth it if it did work.</li>
            <li> For me it was worth it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Itches a bit, but its worth it for the results.</li>
            <li> Worth a try anyway</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> It was worth going for Lipogaine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried the foams also and feel like they aren&#x27;t as effective and dry out too quickly.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s right, even if I don&#x27;t shampoo, I always use their solution.</li>
            <li> Because it has DHT blocker and vitamins that keep those follicles open, it clearly is more effective than regular Rogaine.  </li>
            <li> Great product but really small bottles</li>
            <li> I started noticing around that same time that my face was developing very fine peach fuzz like a baby’s skin</li>
            <li> Although their prices are higher, I find the better quality to be worth the extra money.</li>
            <li> Fast and discrete delivery!</li>
            <li> God bless ;)</li>
            <li> before taking a shower if u plan on using minoxidil first and then taking a shower.</li>
            <li> Way better than regular minoxidil!</li>
            <li> They make your hair and nails grow fast!</li>
            <li> Must admit that this product works very well beside the fact that the shedding period is quite long, I did panic to be honest but Lipogaine kept its promise,</li>
            <li> containing minoxidil needs to first realize that the process of re-growing hair is long-term.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for several years, and I&#x27;m satisfied with the results.</li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;m convinced that consistent use of this product along with supplementation has helped stem the tide of more drastic hair loss for me.</li>
            <li> I have been using Lipogain for Men for 2 years and it corrected my hair loss within the first month and has maintained and improved my hair since.  </li>
            <li> My son has seen great progress and has the intention to continue the use of Lipogaine as long as possible</li>
            <li> (Ofcourse make sure your hairloss isn&#x27;t health related)</li>
            <li> definitely made the hair on top of my head thicker and improved my hairline somewhat.</li>
            <li> and I am very thankful for that!</li>
            <li> it 2 months, be consistent with it, and you&#x27;ll see results.  </li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t see any difference for the first three months but it will happen.</li>
            <li> Well, this stuff has worked pretty well for me.</li>
            <li> I mixed it with powdered Azaleic Acid and is working much better.</li>
            <li> Just like many of you, I have tried various products in a quite consistent manner.</li>
            <li> hairs.today was his first day using lipogaine</li>
            <li> I would only recommend using it with the Micro needle too for even better results.  </li>
            <li> I definitely like it better than minoxidil by itself.</li>
            <li> I took photos of my head when I started and took some more just recently.</li>
            <li> I noticed results after about the first 3 months when it seemed my hair stopped falling out and baby hairs were noticeable.</li>
            <li> I noticed the mild bald patches had new hair growth.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if its new hair or my current hair is thicker, but my crown area where you could easily see my scalp, ESPECIALLY IN SUNLIGHT OR LIGHTED AREAS, is honestly gone.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve been using generic 5% minoxidil from Rite Aid and Kirkland for years and always felt it was just barely good enough.</li>
            <li> make sure you try it  for at least 6 months before making any decisions and compliment it with plenty of healthy food.</li>
            <li> I completely understand and recognize its efficacy, however i believe it should be priced more at around $20 per bottle the most for the company to see a major switch from regular minoxidil to Lipogaine.</li>
            <li> you willing to invest that much on something that can not guarantee its use.&lt;br</li>
            <li> my hairline was pretty much non-existent.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really see any results the first two months.</li>
            <li> and then it pretty much went away.</li>
            <li> So it&#x27;s a pretty a much life-time dedication.  </li>
            <li> so far the product seems to be working and seems to work quickly.</li>
            <li> Just make sure to apply on dry hair</li>
            <li> did arrive well packaged and very quickly from supplier and will definitely use them again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product does not leave any obvious residue on your hair, making it easy to use twice a day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve  used Lipogaine on the front area where is this visible bald spot on the right side and that area has become fuller since using Lipogaine and there&#x27;s even new growth in and just to the front of the border that my hairline had receded to.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but, I honestly use it all over (cause I&#x27;m thinning all over) and when I first started using I noticed little hairs sprouting in my front hairline within 1 month!</li>
            <li> and it really helps.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend Lipogaine!</li>
            <li> Thanks again &#x27;hairloss from steroids&#x27;</li>
            <li> It took about 4-6 months of use but there was noticeable improvement in the crown area, not as much around the temples.  </li>
            <li> The drugstore minoxidil didn&#x27;t seem to help much</li>
            <li> I have so much volume.</li>
            <li> I can really notice by just putting a comb through my hair; almost always a couple flakes turn up.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t know.</li>
            <li> Much faster drying than Kirkland</li>
            <li> and Lipogaine really works for the front as well).  </li>
            <li> OK so let me  start off by saying this product is definitely more expensive than alternative minoxidil formulations, BUT it&#x27;s actually really worth it.</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;extra&amp;#34; ingredients have really helped.</li>
            <li> My scalp used to burn up and get really itchy.</li>
            <li> and I also really struggled spreading the foam around.</li>
            <li> Really wish it worked for me, but no go.</li>
            <li> Held what hair I had but did not regrow much, seed to slow/</li>
            <li> /&gt;Thanks Lipogaine for putting together a product that really works.</li>
            <li> I feel my hair is much stronger than before.</li>
            <li> but that wasn&#x27;t very helpful to me.</li>
            <li> Both worked on my hair in terms of regrowth, but made it appear very sticky or even made my hair have whitish flakes.</li>
            <li> product has light yellow color.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really say that I saw much improvement on the front line</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not simply thin wispy hairs.  </li>
            <li> Before I had to keep my hair very short in order not to accentuate my thinning, but now I can go to a barber and enjoy getting an undercut done.</li>
            <li> This is a really powerful substance for hair growth, it&#x27;s so powerful that it actually grows your eyebrow bushy</li>
            <li> I tried other 5% minoxidils but certainly this one works better for me.</li>
            <li> The trick is to get it early, and use the right product(s).</li>
            <li> This product is way better than other brands that just have minoxidil since Lipogaine has ingredients to stop DHT from acumulating in the hair follices (DHT makes hair thinner and kills the follicles).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The dark shadow was hair that was just growing and the combination of the two products was magic.  </li>
            <li> Only one in my family with a full head of hair</li>
            <li> and I experience less hair falling, while seeing a &#x27;fuzz&#x27; appearing - mainly on the crown area - and darkening into good hair in the future.  </li>
            <li> I really wish to find a way to keep my new grown hair without having it fall out if I stop using this product...</li>
            <li> Easy to use and absolutely no side effects for me.</li>
            <li> this is much better than your standard minoxidil products  such as rogaine .</li>
            <li> At first, I would usually have about 10 or more hairs on my finger after I applied the product.</li>
            <li> I tried so many different types of products but none of them seemed to actually help to regrow hair on the scalp.</li>
            <li> and it works noticeably better then when I used Kirkland 5% minoxidal only, especially in the front area where I now have hair regrowth.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s steadily getting thicker and darker too.  </li>
            <li> I will keep using it along with Lipogaine big 3 Shampoo for 6 more months and make my final judgment after.</li>
            <li> This product worked better than I had hoped and I encourage anyone to give it a try before resorting to riskier or more expensive solutions.</li>
            <li> haven’t experienced any itchiness or redness of the scalp only some minor shedding which is expected at this</li>
            <li> On account of this experience, I highly recommend this product and will continue to use it myself.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend trying this product.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend this brand over rogaine and kirkland after trying them all</li>
            <li> For anyone who is concerned about a receding hairline, I HIGHLY recommend you use this.</li>
            <li> It is far superior to anything I have used in the past and believe you me I have spent many years &amp; 1000&#x27;s of $ on trying different hair regrowth products.</li>
            <li> Now I have my hair for a little while longer :)</li>
            <li> you just have to keep looking and pay a little more.</li>
            <li> I began using Rogaine early on which did seem to halt the hair loss, however it seemed as if my hair had become acclimated and wasn&#x27;t showing much progress</li>
            <li> I was using it for both the top of my head and the crown area and all i could harvest was peach fuzz and a few hair strings.</li>
            <li> Lipogaine after only 5 months is showing exciting results.  </li>
            <li> I even tried hair, skin, and nail tablets, but all my vitamin and mineral levels were normal.</li>
            <li> ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used a drugstore brand of minoxidil for years with moderate success.</li>
            <li> One thing though has pretty much stopped all side effects is adding their big 3 shampoo.</li>
            <li> ; regimen strictly is because if I miss once, I can feel some tension on my scalp, probably due to my hair follicles being filled up with DHT and all the garbage that DHT brings in.</li>
            <li> does not itch the scalp or cause dandruff/flaking as much as other brands i used previously, and seems to be more effective in preventing hairline recession (my biggest problem area) than other brands.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t gone through the shedding phase that&#x27;s supposed to precede the regrowth phase, where the hair stops falling out and new ones supposedly grow in stronger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It did not regrow much new hair</li>
            <li> I have not regrown any new hair, but that has been the case with anything I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> That area has become fuller since using Lipogaine and there&#x27;s even new growth in and just to the front of the border that my hairline had receded to.  </li>
            <li> The product does leave a residue but after a few days you can just rinse it out, or if you live on the coast like me then just go for a swim in the ocean to clear your scalp or better still rinse with some apple cider vinegar.</li>
            <li> My friend a few years back told me about this product as he had used it and liked it.  </li>
            <li> Will admit I was discouraged at the 3 month point when I saw very little progress but stuck at it and am glad I did.</li>
            <li> Let me make this clear!</li>
            <li> Better than the other name brands or generic drug store stuff.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually write reviews, and after using this product, I feel like I should write more often.  </li>
            <li> This solution works, but only for those who are consistent in using the solution.</li>
            <li> If you get the hair growth you were after and stop, I&#x27;m told it will revert back to as if you never used it in the first place.  .  </li>
            <li> The bottles recommend twice a day 8 hours minimum between application, but I only use it once a day, sometimes I miss a day or two straight, still working!</li>
            <li> I have been extremely satisfied with this product, which I have been using for the past year.</li>
            <li> In the first week of using it, my scalp was very itchy due to the propylglycene which is normal.</li>
            <li> My hair on both sides of my head was smooth down to the skin bald except for a few stray fine hairs.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used any other product in the past, but I did a lot of looking on the subject for what we could put on our scalps that would work the best.</li>
            <li> In fact, I only really noticed it very early on</li>
            <li> Been using the product for over 3 years now, significantly slowed down frontal hair thinning.</li>
            <li> My first impression on this product is that it dries much faster than other brands.  </li>
            <li> the way Go away grey its for ur hair to go back to its original colour but</li>
            <li> Lipogaine comes out the clear winner of the three.</li>
            <li> By the third month, my hair loss was completely stopped and I started to notice my hair was much thicker than before in the vertex area.</li>
            <li> , quite obvious when it would dry clean</li>
            <li> I have been using this product in combination with the micro needle and So far this product has been working  </li>
            <li> I have the hairline I had when I was 7 years old.</li>
            <li> The light brown color turned to a green hue when used with this product.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really regrow hair, just seemed to maintain what I had left.</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t have much left to lose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a couple different minoxidil products since I started losing my hair several years ago, and none have really amounted to anything promising.</li>
            <li> It really does work and not just in the back but all over my head</li>
            <li> What I noticed are the following: The crown has stopped loosing hair and is slowly reversing the process but more amazingly it is the hairline that is returning to look just like when i was in my late teens.</li>
            <li> Do not waste time, and do yourself a favor buying Lipogaine.</li>
            <li> Overall this is a very quality Kava  at an unbeatable price.</li>
            <li> No side effects so far.</li>
            <li> early point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> 25 Years old, noticed thinning</li>
            <li> Also is making my beard much thicker and increased chest &amp; back hair since using it.  .  </li>
            <li> (I am in early 30s).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got considerable restoral in that area</li>
            <li> As of now, I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s a product that hasn&#x27;t done for me what it&#x27;s claimed to do for others, but I&#x27;ll play the waiting game in hopes that it just takes more time given that the side effects are very tolerable.</li>
            <li> The derma roller allows the Minoxidil solution to be absorbed at roughly 10x the rate it would without it</li>
            <li> Although more expensive than the competitors, the cosmetic difference is worth it in my opinion.</li>
            <li> After trying this product, I didn&#x27;t notice the change right away, but after a few months I could really tell the difference.</li>
            <li> This is all after only 3 months, which isn&#x27;t very long  into Lipogaine&#x27;s full effectiveness.</li>
            <li> Apparently the Lipogaine has been working and the Folicure thickened the new growth.</li>
            <li> Be patient as it will take a few months before you see significant results.  </li>
            <li> I did a considerable amount of research before starting out and found that others had given high marks to Lipogaine for Men.</li>
            <li> At this price most people will seriously consider its counterpart since at this pricepoint they can purchase a 6 months minoxidil supply vs 1 Lipogaine bottle.</li>
            <li> think again its full of vitamins for your hair and in the long run your hair never turns grey and it makes ur hair thicker aswel .</li>
            <li> I have enough hair now that I actually have to be concerned about styling it every morning for the first time in years.</li>
            <li> I also highly recommend checking out Lipogaine Big 3 Shampoo, L&#x27;Oreal Paris EverStrong Thickening Shampoo and Conditioner.</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend using a high quality shampoo with Lipogaine to reduce dandruff and stiffness.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m currently 25 and after a few months the crown is full of hair again!</li>
            <li> One more thing, it dries quickly, doesn&#x27;t smell, even though I&#x27;m allergic to PG and itches like crazy at times, I&#x27;ll continue on using it.</li>
            <li> My hairline was about 2 inches back from its normal place.</li>
            <li> I see brand new hair growth all over, especially in the receding area.</li>
            <li> It does not smell, dries much faster than regular minoxidil, and does not cause itchiness as the regular minoxidil products do either.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s all coming back now slowly but surely.  </li>
            <li> That created the need to wear wigs because I had no other alternative.</li>
            <li> The odd part is that I&#x27;m seeing faster hair regrowth on the right hand side of my receding hairline.</li>
            <li> However, I did not notice much difference since it was not really hair loss but a cycle of losing hair and new hair growing back which you can research.</li>
            <li> Now it’s not thick man hair, but seriously having a hairy face is not close to cool.</li>
            <li> So, I highly recommend Lipogaine for Men and I definitely suggest that you use it in unison with the Lipogaine Big 3 Shampoo.</li>
            <li> This is a Fixed formula with a key ingredient called minoxidil.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 34 year old male</li>
            <li> I started using Lipogaine in my early 30&#x27;s when I began to notice moderate thinning around the crown and temple areas.</li>
            <li> finally decided to try lipogaine as it has additional natural DHT ingredients in it.</li>
            <li> I am in the early stages of thinning and this stuff has definitely thickened my hair.</li>
            <li> You might not even need the full 1ml dose required if your thinning hair area is small.</li>
            <li> wished that I had tried lipogaine a few years earlier so my hair would be as full as when I was 20s by now.</li>
            <li> I have been having hair loss problems due to genetic issues and had lost a large amount of hair.</li>
            <li> And make sure ur hands r dry too, and also wait at least 2 hrs.</li>
            <li> So far so good, even with a bad diet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After combining the topical solution with the Big 3 shampoo, I have noticed that the my hair completely stops shedding altogether, nothing on my fingers when i run my hands through my hair in the shower.</li>
            <li> i apply with a Qtip once daily and could apply to the more thin areas twice per day.</li>
            <li> In 6 month i have spent close to $500 or more because it takes at least 2 bottles to apply in a month (twice daily).</li>
            <li> The only CON I can think of regarding Minoxidil in general is, it&#x27;s a life time commitment.</li>
            <li> Other than that, I didn&#x27;t notice much difference until the end of the second month.</li>
            <li> However, if a medical product is not guaranteed to work on a large scale of the population then it is not worth the risk.</li>
            <li> Other products make my hair dry and crisp</li>
            <li> many other reviews, the only negative about this product is that it says it&#x27;s a 1month supply, for me</li>
            <li> far as side effects are concerned, the itchy scalp is very minor for me.</li>
            <li> We started noticing new growth less than a month after he started using it and within about 3-6 months, his hairline had come forward at least an inch and filled in dramatically.  </li>
            <li> I noticed a difference at first, shortly after using it, but it was not until a few months later when I stopped using it for about a month because of surgery I had done.</li>
            <li> Secondly, if u take a shower dry your hair completely and wait atleast 10 min before using minoxidil, both lipogaine and Costco brand</li>
            <li> I liked to keep my hair long because I could cover spots where my hair was very thin</li>
            <li> After few months of using, I can definitely see the positive results and would recommend it.</li>
            <li> I used several different brands of straight 5% minxoidil for half a year.</li>
            <li> I started loosing my hair in my mid 20&#x27;s and was very thin up top.</li>
            <li> The price is very acceptable compared to the $35 a month supply for a plain minoxidil in my country.</li>
            <li> this is an ongoing treatment that you will keep administering all life long and at a certain point can becoming very difficult to maintain and afford.</li>
            <li> Since using Lipogaine diligently, I have a full thick head of hair!</li>
            <li> but I was still having a lot of trouble keeping my hair because as I&#x27;ve gotten older the hair is falling out faster.  </li>
            <li> not sure it grows hair, but certainly slows loss...</li>
            <li> This was due to bad hair care and stress which I suffered over a girl I loved who apparently didn&#x27;t care about me.</li>
            <li> Its not a miracle drug so you have to be consistent in using it and give it at least 3 months.</li>
            <li> I have been lucky to have very thick hair</li>
            <li> Just like any other medical remedy such as advil or tylenol, the effect will be the same on just about anyone.</li>
            <li> Got this for my husband a few weeks ago, and he already sees some new growth.</li>
            <li> First of all, I am not sure yet if this product is going to regrow hair, since I just spent one month of using it.</li>
            <li> fast.this stuff really does work.can&#x27;t have all this positive without negative right??the negative about this product</li>
            <li> After having used lipogaine for 6 months now, i have had minor results.</li>
            <li> this time im in it for the long haul</li>
            <li> I decided before the bald patches became bigger and harder to hide I would seek out help.</li>
            <li> I lost long</li>
            <li> I am a long time minoxidil user.</li>
            <li> Lipogaine + RegenePure Shampoo + Go Away Grey Capsules + IGrow Laser Helmet .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for a few years and must say this is clearly a step above Rogaine and other Minoxidil-only solutions.  </li>
            <li> Unlike generic minoxidil, lipogaine has other ingredients which help the delivery of the minoxidil and rejuvenate hair.</li>
            <li> The only other side effect for me is flakes.</li>
            <li> Definitely suggest using it if you can not get results from other brands.</li>
            <li> It also only takes 3 hours to dry where other minoxidil brands take 4+.</li>
            <li> Then blow dry my hair.</li>
            <li> They were itchy, running on my face and took ages to dry.</li>
            <li> Expect a slow, but steady improvement.</li>
            <li> After the beginning of the third month I started seeing what looked like a dark shadow on my scalp.</li>
            <li> which only slowed down hair loss.  </li>
            <li> By using the solution along with other chinese natural medicine I have maintained my youth - by at least looking</li>
            <li> (your hair won&#x27;t dry correctly if you apply on wet hair)</li>
            <li> After about four months though, I&#x27;d only see maybe five or less.</li>
            <li> Also, not only does it have the active ingredient of minoxidil that increases blood flow to the area, but also other ingredients that like saw palmetto that help seed the scalp for hair growth as well.    </li>
            <li> However, I noticed something, the following weeks, I had new strands that were growing and the hair which was thin, had become thicker.</li>
            <li> I gave a little background to state my situation, because if you have a similar scenario like mine, then this is for you.</li>
            <li> i have seen a little hair growth in a short period of time</li>
            <li> I chose Lipogaine because it is only topical, as some of the ingested solutions can have seriously negative side effects.</li>
            <li> Although it contains additional ingredients that block DHT, it is still not a promising solution for hair regrowth.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong as long as follow the instructions and apply consistently.  </li>
            <li> I was scared and overreacted as I loved my hair and hated the idea of being bald.</li>
            <li> start, after about 2 and a half months and initial shedding (the most unpleasant part of every minoxidil based treatment) I started to notice my hair was a little thicker than before in the vertex</li>
            <li> Fairly easy to apply, doesn&#x27;t smell too terrible, and doesn&#x27;t stain pillows or flake much.</li>
            <li> that this product does not make my hair as sticky as other name</li>
            <li> I read a lot about this product, read other reviews and decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li> I then tried other brands of minoxidil including Kirkland and Walgreen minoxodil.</li>
            <li> Is it due to liposome technology?  </li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t say there is any regrowth per se ( just like with all other products on the market)</li>
            <li> so Iam going to write for all you other bald men who want hair</li>
            <li> Having used this product for about 9 months, and having been skeptical at first, it works.  </li>
            <li> Been using for 4 months, didn&#x27;t want to write any review until after a few months because that&#x27;s how long it takes to see results.</li>
            <li> The only topical I&#x27;ve ever used that didn&#x27;t cause broken or inflamed skin.  </li>
            <li> What&#x27;s worse, the last batch I purchased (a month ago) suddenly irritates my scalp, so I can&#x27;t use the 3 pack I bought.</li>
            <li> Although I&#x27;ve read that minoxidil products are not best at working in this area, I have spent several months carefully applying Lipogaine to this area and have seen definite regrowth.</li>
            <li> only thing that I don&#x27;t like about this product is that it makes your hair stiff, so when they recommend to use the product twice a day (once in the morning, and once before going to bed), expect to have some fairly stiff hair throughout your workday.</li>
            <li> Plus it mad me SUPER Dizzy.  </li>
            <li> It applies way easier than other brands without the oily mess.</li>
            <li> Only my familymembers have seen me without my wig and they can’t believe how thick my hair is.</li>
            <li> However, until I get my hair back to its totally thick glory, I will wear a lumberjack beard if it means my hair is returning.  </li>
            <li> Ever since the FDA shut down Dr Lees site</li>
            <li> It slowed down the hair fall out and gave my hair a thicker feeling.</li>
            <li> short, Lipogaine worked for me while other regular minoxidil failed.  </li>
            <li> I only see little progress, though it takes at least 3 months for it to work as stated on their website.</li>
            <li> However, as soon as I was 17 and a half, I truly had frontal hair loss.</li>
            <li> But from May 2014 to September 2014, I had ridiculous hair loss from front but also from the middle.</li>
            <li> Of course it still does, but much less.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Using the product I have found it does make my hair slightly sticky but</li>
            <li> If applied once every 12 hours, I see less hair loss, and also less oil(?)</li>
            <li> Been using it for about a year and a half.</li>
            <li> $33 dollars (Canadian), even less for Americans ($25)</li>
            <li> When you start using it, it leaves a slight burning feeling on the scalp after application for about 15 minutes, which I think is another thing that shows it is working.</li>
            <li> It dries a little faster, very relatively to other brands of plain minoxidil.  </li>
            <li> and I see little hairs growing</li>
            <li> So let me start by giving a little insight on how I got to use this product and my conditions which allowed me to choose this product.</li>
            <li> And I understand this is a little expenaive , but</li>
            <li> /&gt;You can save a little money by purchasing the 3 month supply, which comes with 3 vials and one eye-dropper.</li>
            <li> If you find yourself looking for something a little stronger don&#x27;t worry because it is out there</li>
            <li> I have had 1 or 2 days (rare) of bad flaking but wasn&#x27;t anything to be concerned about.  .  </li>
            <li> Trust me when i tell you, it is a waste of money.</li>
            <li> And finally a few days after Christmas 2014, I ordered lipogaine.</li>
            <li> /&gt;While it may not work for everyone and some users may be impatient, it has exceeded my expectations.</li>
            <li> My hair was at the point where I could just start to notice that it was starting to thin.</li>
            <li> Give it a few months before you quit.</li>
            <li> (my forehead hairline is much worse than the back</li>
            <li> I have been using this product everyday for 4 years.</li>
            <li> Nothing happened, waste of money</li>
            <li> For instance, Rogaine, which is one of the alternatives, even w/ mousse type, make styling harder because your hair loses strength and looks &amp;#34;soggy&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> In order to truly get results and not lose them, you have to be strict on using Lipogaine twice a day EVERYDAY, otherwise it will stop working, and in fact your body will seem to want to make up for lost time and encourage your hair to fall out faster.    </li>
            <li> This is actually the least serious side effect u can have.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say try it for at least 3-6 months and see if you notice any change from other plain minoxidil formulations.</li>
            <li> After a lengthy hospital stay and having to temporarily stop my regular regimen, I was seeing alarming amounts of hair falling out and was desperately seeking something to reverse the trend.</li>
            <li> This and do not more than stated.</li>
            <li> It is pointless and will not help u nor speed the process.</li>
            <li> Small hair coming out and it gets longer in time which makes hair look thicker.</li>
            <li> I was dizzy for over a month wondering what was wrong with me and finally realized this was the cause.  </li>
            <li> I hardly see any lost hair when I take shower.</li>
            <li> But my hair loss at both frontal and vertex was at least reversed for 8 years.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This product outperforms the standard minoxidil solutions which produced disappointing results.  </li>
            <li> My hair is growing in so thick</li>
            <li> In fact, my hair is looking decently thick.</li>
            <li> If you are new to Kava,  don&#x27;t hesitate to give this product a try because you will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> , nose hair grows faster, facial hair grows faster, and some hairs appear in weird places in your face!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve put it on my scalp, can hardly find any thin spots.</li>
            <li> This product at least makes the hair I do have appear thicker and prevents my hair loss from getting worse.</li>
            <li> I think there is some serious breakthrough behind the formula of this product.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed with the last shipment as the solution was  </li>
            <li> My vertex area which still had some hair was holding thin with the Rogaine.  </li>
            <li> Areas that were noticeably thin before appear thicker.</li>
            <li> I put food on their table for 6 months and all they gave in return is false</li>
            <li> I also like the fact Lipogaine (unlike other minoxidil products) does not have a bad smell and does not create problems with styling my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had a bad experience with Finasteride and read some other reviews on Lipogaine and decided to try it.  </li>
            <li> haha.6months later he sends a pic.holy crap!</li>
            <li> I was skeptical in the beginning.</li>
            <li> I quit using &amp;#34;the pill&amp;#34; due to horrific side effects and just thought it was time to throw in the towel.  </li>
            <li> Lipogaine does not smell bad (like Spectral DNC) nor change the texture of your hair in ways that makes styling difficult (like Rogaine Foam).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But my hair was still dropping like crazy, every day I lost about 30-40 hair strands.</li>
            <li> Of course, there will be bad reviews on this product as there are on every product, but not from me.</li>
            <li> a month isn&#x27;t bad either for recovered confidence.  .  </li>
            <li> It was horrible on my head</li>
            <li> The worst part is that they didn&#x27;t work at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> so far the product seems to be working and seems to work quickly. i am a woman with hair loss and i like that this product does not make my hair as sticky as other name product.s. i apply with a Qtip once daily and could apply to the more thin areas twice per day. like the product and that it comes in a multiple bottle package so i don&#x27;t have to reorder as often.</li>
            <li> Works great  good product</li>
            <li> Let me start off by saying that this product is not as effective as many of the people have claimed it to be!!!  Although it contains additional ingredients that block DHT, it is still not a promising solution for hair regrowth. After having used lipogaine for 6 months now, i have had minor results. Along with lipogaine shampoo and lipogaine minoxidil, i was using a microneedle roller 1.5mm on my scalp. I was using it for both the top of my head and the crown area and all i could harvest was peach fuzz and a few hair strings. Trust me when i tell you, it is a waste of money. In 6 month i have spent close to $500 or more because it takes at least 2 bottles to apply in a month (twice daily). Let me make this clear! This is a Fixed formula with a key ingredient called minoxidil. Just like any other medical remedy such as advil or tylenol, the effect will be the same on just about anyone. The majority of people will experience the same results. However, if a medical product is not guaranteed to work on a large scale of the population then it is not worth the risk. The numbers are not on your side so my advice is dont give your money until they have invested time into creating a more substantial product that will guarantee that you get your money&#x27;s worth.&lt;br /&gt;With 500 dollars I put food on their table for 6 months and all they gave in return is false hope.&lt;br /&gt;Are you willing to invest that much on something that can not guarantee its use.&lt;br /&gt;CAN YOU PUT YOUR TRUST IN ANYTHING THAT ISN&#x27;T RELIABLE They cant promise that their product will work so how can you trust them. Will you risk $500 dollars.</li>
            <li> I used Rogaine for several months before trying this. As you can tell by the ingredients, as well as using it, it&#x27;s a more comprehensive product. I have achieved better results than by solely using Rogaine. Even though they&#x27;re both marketed at 5% minoxidil, I believe this is more potent. I often get headaches after using Lipo, which is a symptom of minox overdose. I&#x27;ve found the best method is to use 1/2 dose of each, no more headaches.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product in combination with the micro needle and So far this product has been working  I can see a big difference in the growth of my hair.</li>
            <li> Tried Rogaine for 8 yrs. which only slowed down hair loss.  Lipogaine after only 5 months is showing exciting results.  Of course, there will be bad reviews on this product as there are on every product, but not from me.</li>
            <li> Im about a month in and I see little hairs growing</li>
            <li> This is a good product. I started using it a couple of years ago to try to keep all my hair from falling out. I have to say it doesn&#x27;t help hair grow back but does seem to be effective in slowing the thinning process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4 out of 5 since the I&#x27;ll reserve the last star for something that can make my hair grow back!</li>
            <li> This was great. Much better then the others! Fast and discrete delivery!</li>
            <li> Have used the product for several months now, and though the results are incredible yet, there are definite improvements and I will continue to use the product and recommend others to try it as well. I&#x27;ve noticed my hair loss to have virtually stopped and some degree of increase in thickness in my hair. Company also cares and has reached out which is nice to see.</li>
            <li> It works! Been using the product for over 3 years now, significantly slowed down frontal hair thinning.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a number of months. I read a lot about this product, read other reviews and decided to give it a try. I noticed a difference at first, shortly after using it, but it was not until a few months later when I stopped using it for about a month because of surgery I had done. During that time my hair became thinner and I started using this product again. That is when I started noticing a significant improvement in the thickness of my hair. On account of this experience, I highly recommend this product and will continue to use it myself.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t write many reviews but I felt compelled to write this one. I have suffered from traction alopecia for many years. After years of wearing extensions my hairline was pretty much non-existent. My hair on both sides of my head was smooth down to the skin bald except for a few stray fine hairs. My hairline was about 2 inches back from its normal place. That created the need to wear wigs because I had no other alternative. I have invested thousands of dollars in &#x27;for women&#x27; products and they didn&#x27;t work for me. I thought maybe I needed something stronger so I researched 5% minoxidil and thought Id give it a try. I am ecstatic to write my days of having no alternative but to wear a wig are rapidly ending. I didn&#x27;t really see any results the first two months. After the beginning of the third month I started seeing what looked like a dark shadow on my scalp. I actually though my scalp was getting sun through my wig. . That&#x27;s how clueless I was. I still continued to use the product because I was determined to use the 3 month supply until the end before I made a judgement. I started noticing around that same time that my face was developing very fine peach fuzz like a baby’s skin but still I didn&#x27;t put 2 and 2 together. Since I was coming to the end of my supply I decided to try a different product so I went to the beauty supply store and a consultant recommended a product called Folicure. She said it restored her customer’s hair who were undergoing Chemo. So that sold me and I decided to give it a try.  That evening I used an ampule of the Folicure along with my regular nightly dropper of Lipogaine. In the morning I was in a state of shock. Apparently the Lipogaine has been working and the Folicure thickened the new growth. The dark shadow was hair that was just growing and the combination of the two products was magic.  I have the hairline I had when I was 7 years old. That’s over 30 years ago.  My hair is growing in so thick I am just astounded. Only my familymembers have seen me without my wig and they can’t believe how thick my hair is. Now there is a downside and that is, I have had to have my face waxed twice because the peach fuzz I mentioned earlier gets thicker. I feel like Chewbacca with this hair growing on my face. Now it’s not thick man hair, but seriously having a hairy face is not close to cool. However, until I get my hair back to its totally thick glory, I will wear a lumberjack beard if it means my hair is returning.  I’m kidding, but maybe not. Anyway, If this review helps any woman out there (or man) who has experienced the sadness of losing their hair, I hope this review helps you. God bless ;)</li>
            <li> So let me start by giving a little insight on how I got to use this product and my conditions which allowed me to choose this product. Ever since I was 16 I had some hair loss. I was scared and overreacted as I loved my hair and hated the idea of being bald. However, I did not notice much difference since it was not really hair loss but a cycle of losing hair and new hair growing back which you can research. However, as soon as I was 17 and a half, I truly had frontal hair loss. My father and my grandfather both have big foreheads and it runs in my family. I went to a dermatologist and he said I have a healthy head, and my skin was healthy and all my blood works came normal. So I eventually gave up and realized I was bound to lose hair. Though I still worried occasionally and used different oils. Oils are very healthy, but what u need to know is that if you leave it on for a while, it will clog ur hair follicles and cause hair loss. This I learned in September 2014 when I was 19. But from May 2014 to September 2014, I had ridiculous hair loss from front but also from the middle. This was due to bad hair care and stress which I suffered over a girl I loved who apparently didn&#x27;t care about me. But in September 2014, I started taking better hair care, by using oil but not leaving it on and caring for my hair when taking a shower. I liked to keep my hair long because I could cover spots where my hair was very thin which was the front middle. But my hair was still dropping like crazy, every day I lost about 30-40 hair strands. That is a lot. Even though I had reduced my stress level and took better care my hair was dropping. I even tried hair, skin, and nail tablets, but all my vitamin and mineral levels were normal. Then I researched into minoxidil. I read and read for months and different things which people had tried. And finally a few days after Christmas 2014, I ordered lipogaine. Unlike generic minoxidil, lipogaine has other ingredients which help the delivery of the minoxidil and rejuvenate hair. In the first week of using it, my scalp was very itchy due to the propylglycene which is normal. This is actually the least serious side effect u can have. Two weeks shortly after using I had continued hair loss of about 30-40 strands daily. However, I noticed something, the following weeks, I had new strands that were growing and the hair which was thin, had become thicker. And shortly after I also both the lipogaine big 3 shampoo which helps the delivery of minoxidil and it really helps. I only see little progress, though it takes at least 3 months for it to work as stated on their website. So all in all, in about 2 months I have had results which for me are more than what I could&#x27;ve asked for. I gave a little background to state my situation, because if you have a similar scenario like mine, then this is for you. And I understand this is a little expenaive , but what u can do is get generic minoxidil from Costco. That is very cheap and works great as well. And what I would suggest is use Lipogaine in the morning and Costco Minoxdil at night because, lipogaine is not oily and it works like a gel and you can style your hair very nicely. Costco minoxidil is oily so u can use it at night. Secondly, if u take a shower dry your hair completely and wait atleast 10 min before using minoxidil, both lipogaine and Costco brand and this is for all brands of minoxidil. And make sure ur hands r dry too, and also wait at least 2 hrs. before taking a shower if u plan on using minoxidil first and then taking a shower. This will allow all the minoxidil to be absorbed. And try to drop the lipogaine on your hair follicle area and not the actual strand. This and do not more than stated. It is pointless and will not help u nor speed the process. You might not even need the full 1ml dose required if your thinning hair area is small. Anyways I hope this helped and I wish you guys all the best and good luck getting your hair back. I am not a paid individual nor will I be compensated for this review in anyway. I just wrote this to help people because some reviews don&#x27;t actually explain how and why the individual started the treatment.</li>
            <li> Works great! Way better than regular minoxidil! I&#x27;m a 34 year old male and I&#x27;ve been using generic 5% minoxidil from Rite Aid and Kirkland for years and always felt it was just barely good enough. It has a sticky consistency and smells like alcohol. Lipogaine dries more like a paste and doesn&#x27;t smell as strong. It also only takes 3 hours to dry where other minoxidil brands take 4+. I also highly recommend checking out Lipogaine Big 3 Shampoo, L&#x27;Oreal Paris EverStrong Thickening Shampoo and Conditioner. Also take Biotin 10,000mcg, super collagen dietary supplement, use emu oil and also organic apple cider vinegar (w/ mother) couple times a week to help block DHT, MSM supplements. They make your hair and nails grow fast! Highly recommend Lipogaine!</li>
            <li> Great product delivered as promiced, I have been using for 3 months, and YES hair is growing bald.&lt;br /&gt;I thought I was on verge of loosing hair but gave it a try and now i am hooked. try it today.</li>
            <li> great price and this is much better than your standard minoxidil products  such as rogaine . i have seen a little hair growth in a short period of time but I never use it for extended periods of time but this time im in it for the long haul</li>
            <li> This Product is the best on the market, it works, for best result use with the LIPOGAIN shampoo.Awsome product Emmanuel Atlanta Ga</li>
            <li> I was disappointed with the last shipment as the solution was  very&lt;br /&gt;watery and dilute</li>
            <li> Great product, I&#x27;ve had very good results with this product.</li>
            <li> Been using this for a year now and I can tell it slowed my hairloss and helped cover the front area where most of my hairloss is. MPB runs in my family so I&#x27;m happy this is working. Its not a miracle drug so you have to be consistent in using it and give it at least 3 months.</li>
            <li> I have to say that this seems to work well.  The only problem is that it seems to leave a yellow tint on my hair (my hair is white).  In a moment of poor judgment, I used a best selling man&#x27;s hair coloring.  The light brown color turned to a green hue when used with this product.</li>
            <li> Must admit that this product works very well beside the fact that the shedding period is quite long, I did panic to be honest but Lipogaine kept its promise, to be clear, I use to see more than 10 hairs on my pillow every morning, after 2 months of use I see just 1 or 2 max.. &amp; yes my hair is regrowing perfectly on my receding hairline, I confirm also that it works for receding hairlines. I do recommend Lipogain to anyone being concerned with hairloss. One more thing, it dries quickly, doesn&#x27;t smell, even though I&#x27;m allergic to PG and itches like crazy at times, I&#x27;ll continue on using it. Thanks again &#x27;hairloss from steroids&#x27;</li>
            <li> In 2012, I started using various products containing minoxidil to deal with thinning hair. It was most noticeable in the crown area, but also thinning elsewhere. I&#x27;ve used Rogaine Foam, Spectral DNC and Lipogaine. Lipogaine comes out the clear winner of the three. All 3 helped re-grow hair, but only Lipogaine did this without unwanted side-effects: Lipogaine does not smell bad (like Spectral DNC) nor change the texture of your hair in ways that makes styling difficult (like Rogaine Foam).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyone that&#x27;s starting to use a product containing minoxidil needs to first realize that the process of re-growing hair is long-term. I did not start seeing noticeable results for about 3 months. Again, I emphasize START SEEING RESULTS. You are not going to grow a full head of hair in 3 months - but if you keep at it, the product will work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One aspect of my thinning hair I don&#x27;t like is my hairline at the forehead. Although I&#x27;ve read that minoxidil products are not best at working in this area, I have spent several months carefully applying Lipogaine to this area and have seen definite regrowth. Hopefully I will work as well as it has with the rest of my head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m definitely pleased with the results. My head of hair is fuller and the hair is strong. I also like the fact Lipogaine (unlike other minoxidil products) does not have a bad smell and does not create problems with styling my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can save a little money by purchasing the 3 month supply, which comes with 3 vials and one eye-dropper.</li>
            <li> Good product...not sure it grows hair, but certainly slows loss...</li>
            <li> When I turned 50 I noticed my hair thinning from the crown of my head forward. By age 52 the thinning turned into bald patches. I decided before the bald patches became bigger and harder to hide I would seek out help. I found Lipogaine and decided that $25 a month is not a lot of money and will certainly be worth it if it did work. I took the Lipogaine as directed and after two months I noticed the mild bald patches had new hair growth. Now I&#x27;m back to the thinning stage. I&#x27;m confident that my six month update will prove the thinning stage will be transformed into normal hair growth. I totally recommend this product and happy I took the chance. Thank you Lipogaine!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for several years, and I&#x27;m satisfied with the results. I started using Lipogaine in my early 30&#x27;s when I began to notice moderate thinning around the crown and temple areas. It took about 4-6 months of use but there was noticeable improvement in the crown area, not as much around the temples.  My only concern is that if I go &amp;#34;cold turkey&amp;#34; with this product, rapid hair loss might ensue...  Overall, I&#x27;m convinced that consistent use of this product along with supplementation has helped stem the tide of more drastic hair loss for me.</li>
            <li> Works great! Keeps what you have!</li>
            <li> I think this product is great and helps at keeping the hair that I have with some minor regrowth too. Definitely the best minoxidil out in the market right now and I think anyone facing hairloss problems should give this a try. It&#x27;s not some magical miracle product, but it is going to be better than not using anything.</li>
            <li> I have been using Lipogain for Men for 2 years and it corrected my hair loss within the first month and has maintained and improved my hair since.  It is also a great alternative to hair gel or hair cream to style your hair and keep it in place all day while growing new hair.  I have been very happy with this product and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> I can truly say that is the best product out there! Better than the other name brands or generic drug store stuff.  The instructions say to only use on the crown of your head but, I honestly use it all over (cause I&#x27;m thinning all over) and when I first started using I noticed little hairs sprouting in my front hairline within 1 month! Just make sure to apply on dry hair (your hair won&#x27;t dry correctly if you apply on wet hair) then you&#x27;ll be fine to apply your favorite styling product.  You can&#x27;t go wrong as long as follow the instructions and apply consistently.  Been using for about a year.</li>
            <li> This stuff works. I cannot stress the fact enough. It has regrown hair I lost long ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used a drugstore brand of minoxidil for years with moderate success. Didn&#x27;t really regrow hair, just seemed to maintain what I had left. After a lengthy hospital stay and having to temporarily stop my regular regimen, I was seeing alarming amounts of hair falling out and was desperately seeking something to reverse the trend. The drugstore minoxidil didn&#x27;t seem to help much and I was even contemplating more drastic measures. After finding Lipogaine on Amazon, I thought I&#x27;d step up to the pump and try it. I really didn&#x27;t have much left to lose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nearly 60 days into using it once a day prior to bedtime, the hair loss has stopped and I am regrowing hair on both my crown and temples. My hair is overall thicker and healthier. My wife said it is noticeably fuller and can&#x27;t stop running her fingers through it. Neither can I!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am now using the Lipogaine shampoo, alternating it with Regenepure or Nioxin shampoo and conditioner. The results are phenomenal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While it may not work for everyone and some users may be impatient, it has exceeded my expectations. I am completely satisfied with Lipogaine and highly recommend it to anyone concerned about hair loss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t hesitate. Just buy it.</li>
            <li> This product is incredible.  I started to see noticeable thinning in the temple region at around 19.  I used a well-known pill for hair loss for 7 years and it caused nothing but problems.  I also used a topical but it left my scalp inflamed.  I quit using &amp;#34;the pill&amp;#34; due to horrific side effects and just thought it was time to throw in the towel.  Fast forward to age 35, while I would love to have kept the lion mane I once had in my teens, I&#x27;m so happy to still have a head full of healthy hair.  Lipogaine made it possible to maintain my hair count.  The only topical I&#x27;ve ever used that didn&#x27;t cause broken or inflamed skin.  I also take special vitamins.  I feel extremely fortunate to have battled alopecia and won.  The trick is to get it early, and use the right product(s).</li>
            <li> Awesome!&lt;br /&gt;Defintely has kept my hair intact!  Slowing nature.  Only one in my family with a full head of hair</li>
            <li> Seems to maintain hair and possibly regrow in some areas.</li>
            <li> Though I&#x27;ve only been using the product for about 1 month, I&#x27;ve already started to see results (note that I&#x27;ve been using this product alongside&lt;br /&gt;ProFolla® AnaStim Ha® Follicle Stimulator). The odd part is that I&#x27;m seeing faster hair regrowth on the right hand side of my receding hairline. Hopefully this will balance out with time (I&#x27;ve read that consumers see results within a 3 month period).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing that I don&#x27;t like about this product is that it makes your hair stiff, so when they recommend to use the product twice a day (once in the morning, and once before going to bed), expect to have some fairly stiff hair throughout your workday.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for a few years and must say this is clearly a step above Rogaine and other Minoxidil-only solutions.  Friends and family members have noticed the overall health &amp; fullness of my hair.  Be patient as it will take a few months before you see significant results.  I definitely recommend using a high quality shampoo with Lipogaine to reduce dandruff and stiffness.  I use this product with Lipogaine&#x27;s Big 3 Shampoo for maximum effect.</li>
            <li> Works  great. Better than Rogaine for sure.</li>
            <li> The product is very good and works. Expect a slow, but steady improvement.</li>
            <li> My friend a few years back told me about this product as he had used it and liked it.  My hair was at the point where I could just start to notice that it was starting to thin. I have now used this product for over 2 years now and I must say I have noticed my hair has not got minimal/ if any thinner.  I had tried a cheaper product and that had caused flaking. Since I switched to lipogaine that has gone away. So I am happy with this product and would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> This is honestly the best product for hair regrowth. This is how I use it. I&#x27;ve effectively stopped loosing hair and am beginning to see decent regrowth, to the point where friend and family have notice. I wash my hair with Nizoral, then use a good conditioner. After I use a dermaroller on my scalp before applying the Lipogaine. Then blow dry my hair. I have so much volume. The combination with Lipogaine is the best. Ive tried cheaper versions, they make my scalp itchy. This does not!  Give it a few months before you quit. I noticed after about 2 months. Seriously great product.</li>
            <li> My son has seen great progress and has the intention to continue the use of Lipogaine as long as possible</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a couple different minoxidil products since I started losing my hair several years ago, and none have really amounted to anything promising. Although, in my earlier attempts, I don&#x27;t think I used the products consistently enough. Since I decided to just stick it out with Lipogaine about 6 months ago, my usage has been more consistent (almost always twice a day). There was a period of time after four months of usage that I was losing a lesser amount of hair. At first, I would usually have about 10 or more hairs on my finger after I applied the product. After about four months though, I&#x27;d only see maybe five or less. However, now I seem to be having more like 10 again. I haven&#x27;t gone through the shedding phase that&#x27;s supposed to precede the regrowth phase, where the hair stops falling out and new ones supposedly grow in stronger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as side effects are concerned, the itchy scalp is very minor for me. In fact, I only really noticed it very early on and then it pretty much went away. The only other side effect for me is flakes. I guess it&#x27;s from when the product dries up on the scalp. I can really notice by just putting a comb through my hair; almost always a couple flakes turn up. Yet even those are fewer now than they used to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ultimately, I&#x27;m not optimistic that Lipogaine is going to work for me. As of now, I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s a product that hasn&#x27;t done for me what it&#x27;s claimed to do for others, but I&#x27;ll play the waiting game in hopes that it just takes more time given that the side effects are very tolerable.</li>
            <li> I am a long time minoxidil user. I used Rogaine minoxidil for five years and it gradually stopped working for me. I then tried other brands of minoxidil including Kirkland and Walgreen minoxodil. Neither of them worked any better than Rogaine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I finally decided to try lipogaine as it has additional natural DHT ingredients in it. My first impression on this product is that it dries much faster than other brands.  Is it due to liposome technology?  I really don&#x27;t know. Other than that, I didn&#x27;t notice much difference until the end of the second month. By the third month, my hair loss was completely stopped and I started to notice my hair was much thicker than before in the vertex area. There was also lot of baby hair sprouting out along my hairline. By the end of 6 months, I have seen amazing result. I am not saying that my hair was as full as when I was 20s (I am in 40 now). But my hair loss at both frontal and vertex was at least reversed for 8 years.&lt;br /&gt;I wished that I had tried lipogaine a few years earlier so my hair would be as full as when I was 20s by now.</li>
            <li> My husband has been using this product on his hairline for almost two years now and has had great success with it.  We started noticing new growth less than a month after he started using it and within about 3-6 months, his hairline had come forward at least an inch and filled in dramatically.  We are both VERY happy with the results and would most definitely recommend this product for combating hair loss.</li>
            <li> I like this product much better than rogain minoxidil, mostly because it doesn&#x27;t make my scalp too greasy. After few months of using, I can definitely see the positive results and would recommend it.</li>
            <li> Takes time but with a good DHT supplement  like NuHAIR it works wonders would recommend to anyone who wants to regrowth their hair back excellent product would recommend to anyone having hair loss issues ,but just be patient like I was and the result will soon show.</li>
            <li> Thank you for this product. It worked for me on both receding hairlines and frontal hair loss. I&#x27;ve  used Lipogaine on the front area where is this visible bald spot on the right side and that area has become fuller since using Lipogaine and there&#x27;s even new growth in and just to the front of the border that my hairline had receded to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of my friend recommended try Lipogaine. In 3 months, I&#x27;ve had hair coming back on my head in places (in frontal and vertex). Small hair coming out and it gets longer in time which makes hair look thicker.</li>
            <li> I think it works but it is so sticky that it cannot be used before going to bed. Excellent in the morning though.</li>
            <li> Been very pleased with the results and product.  Ever since the FDA shut down Dr Lees site this has been a valid alternative  I use in conjunction with laser comb and avodart</li>
            <li> I have tried several different minoxidil products and found this one to be the best. Much faster drying than Kirkland and it&#x27;s growing hair.</li>
            <li> I had been using Rogaine for some years and it worked okay but I was still having a lot of trouble keeping my hair because as I&#x27;ve gotten older the hair is falling out faster.  I had a bad experience with Finasteride and read some other reviews on Lipogaine and decided to try it.  I have been hooked since.  This stuff has been really great for me, and when I moved to Berlin for a year and stopped using it, I lost SO much more hair!  I&#x27;m back in the states as of October and it&#x27;s all coming back now slowly but surely.  Because it has DHT blocker and vitamins that keep those follicles open, it clearly is more effective than regular Rogaine.  I would be super excited if Lipogaine ever came in a foam, but until then I&#x27;m going to keep trucking with the liquid kind.  It really does work and not just in the back but all over my head (my forehead hairline is much worse than the back and Lipogaine really works for the front as well).  Strongly recommended for us boys with bald genes!</li>
            <li> OK so let me  start off by saying this product is definitely more expensive than alternative minoxidil formulations, BUT it&#x27;s actually really worth it. The &amp;#34;extra&amp;#34; ingredients have really helped. My scalp used to burn up and get really itchy. Of course it still does, but much less. One thing though has pretty much stopped all side effects is adding their big 3 shampoo. Now I have my hair for a little while longer :).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I originally was using Kirkland minoxidil foam and it was really cheap and I thought it would be awesome. It was horrible on my head and I also really struggled spreading the foam around. I love that lipogaine is straight up liquid. I&#x27;d say try it for at least 3-6 months and see if you notice any change from other plain minoxidil formulations. For me it was worth it.</li>
            <li> Ive had crown and temple hairloss since i was 17, and this is the best product lve used. I&#x27;m currently 25 and after a few months the crown is full of hair again! Its also working on the temple area but i need a bit more time for better results i think.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; This product is way better than other brands that just have minoxidil since Lipogaine has ingredients to stop DHT from acumulating in the hair follices (DHT makes hair thinner and kills the follicles).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I recommend using shampoos that inhibit DHT aswell, it will give you great results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  (Ofcourse make sure your hairloss isn&#x27;t health related)</li>
            <li> I have been using lipogaine for 3 months and I observe the same results that I had with minoxidil.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for one year and it seems to stopped hair loss. Some hair fuzz has grown where it was once bald.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using both the topical solution and shampoo for several years. They contain great ingredients and are an important part of anyone&#x27;s regimen. I wouldn&#x27;t say there is any regrowth per se ( just like with all other products on the market) but I do belive it helps with maintenance. As others noted, this is one the best minoxidil formula out there: not messy or greasy and doesn&#x27;t make your scalp dry or itchy. The hair also appears healthier.</li>
            <li> definitely made the hair on top of my head thicker and improved my hairline somewhat. i definitely intend to keep using lipogaine as well as the big 3 shampoo.</li>
            <li> Really wish it worked for me, but no go. Plus it mad me SUPER Dizzy.  I was dizzy for over a month wondering what was wrong with me and finally realized this was the cause.  bummer</li>
            <li> After the second set of 3 bottles on 08/03/15 I received a letter from Lipogaine asking me to write a Honest product review for a 3 month supply as a thank you from the company. Honestly this product has worked effectively in my case. What I noticed are the following: The crown has stopped loosing hair and is slowly reversing the process but more amazingly it is the hairline that is returning to look just like when i was in my late teens. I think there is some serious breakthrough behind the formula of this product. However, I simply cannot justify such a steep price considering this is an ongoing treatment that you will keep administering all life long and at a certain point can becoming very difficult to maintain and afford. I completely understand and recognize its efficacy, however i believe it should be priced more at around $20 per bottle the most for the company to see a major switch from regular minoxidil to Lipogaine. At this price most people will seriously consider its counterpart since at this pricepoint they can purchase a 6 months minoxidil supply vs 1 Lipogaine bottle.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product everyday for 4 years. I have tried other brands, but this is the absolute best. It applies way easier than other brands without the oily mess. I just put it in with the supplied dropper and comb over evenly. I started loosing my hair in my mid 20&#x27;s and was very thin up top. It was a huge self esteem crusher. Since using Lipogaine diligently, I have a full thick head of hair! If you are a male with thinning or patchy hair, this stuff is nothing short of a Miracle! Do not waste time, and do yourself a favor buying Lipogaine.</li>
            <li> Overall this is a very quality Kava  at an unbeatable price. This product got me started on the world of Kava  and I am very thankful for that! With that being said, I have since found higher-quality vendors out there. Although their prices are higher, I find the better quality to be worth the extra money. If you are new to Kava,  don&#x27;t hesitate to give this product a try because you will not be disappointed. If you find yourself looking for something a little stronger don&#x27;t worry because it is out there you just have to keep looking and pay a little more. Kava has been fantastic for me, it has eliminated a lot of my anxiety and helps me to relax at night.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Lipogaine for 2 years now, very happy with the product . I will keep using it .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using Lipogaine fom about a year.&lt;br /&gt;At start, after about 2 and a half months and initial shedding (the most unpleasant part of every minoxidil based treatment) I started to notice my hair was a little thicker than before in the vertex area.&lt;br /&gt;Now, after about a year of using it, I can tell for sure that is working. It did not regrow much new hair but it slows/stop the hair loss and my hair is thicker.&lt;br /&gt;As many other reviews, the only negative about this product is that it says it&#x27;s a 1month supply, for me it&#x27;s at maximum 20 days.&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I&#x27;ll continue of using it, in combination with shampoo and pills.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually write reviews, and after using this product, I feel like I should write more often.  The only reason I tried this was because of the amazing reviews people left.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Give it 2 months, be consistent with it, and you&#x27;ll see results.  I don&#x27;t know if its new hair or my current hair is thicker, but my crown area where you could easily see my scalp, ESPECIALLY IN SUNLIGHT OR LIGHTED AREAS, is honestly gone.  Amazing stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Itches a bit, but its worth it for the results.</li>
            <li> Held what hair I had but did not regrow much, seed to slow/stop the hair loss though. Worth a try anyway</li>
            <li> Nothing happened, waste of money</li>
            <li> Lipogaine has been an incredible solution to losing hair. It has not only helped hair growth, but also my scalp feels healthier! Lipogaine is a great product and I would highly recommend it to any men out there with thinning/losing hair.</li>
            <li> Great product good results</li>
            <li> Does the job but everyone is different. Can you make a foam version?</li>
            <li> Well I&#x27;m convinced. I have used Lipogaine now for over 3 months and can say with certainty that changes are taking place. I didn&#x27;t get any sheds, although this may have been attributed to the fact that I was already using a form of minoxidil (Rogaine) for several years now. I began using Rogaine early on which did seem to halt the hair loss, however it seemed as if my hair had become acclimated and wasn&#x27;t showing much progress lately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s when I discovered Lipogaine. And I&#x27;m glad I did. The combination of ingredients proved to be more effective than that of Rogaine which I had used for years. My vertex area which still had some hair was holding thin with the Rogaine.  After the second month on Lipogaine I began noticing the hairs in the vertex area was beginning to thicken up some.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m glad I found this product and gave it a try. This formula does seem to be working well on me and based on the initial outcome, I&#x27;m beginning to feel optimistic that there will be further improvements in the months ahead. I&#x27;ll continue to use this product. It&#x27;s actually boosted my confidence and given me some self esteem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Lipogaine for putting together a product that really works.</li>
            <li> A picture tells a thousand words.  These are the before-after pictures over six months. It requires a lot of patience. You won&#x27;t see any difference for the first three months but it will happen.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Lipogaine for Men for a bit over a year. I switched from generic Rogaine just to give Lipogaine a try. Rogaine worked for me. It slowed down the hair fall out and gave my hair a thicker feeling. After switching to Lipogaine I&#x27;ve noticed hair regrowth. Areas that were noticeably thin before appear thicker. It also seems to be effective on most of my scalp. It also dries quicker after you apply it and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feeling. Lipogaine for men is a bit more expensive than generic Rogaine but to me it&#x27;s worth it. The results out weigh the cost difference.</li>
            <li> I bought this product through Lipogaine official site. Because it worked so well for me, I would like to spread the words here.&lt;br /&gt;I am using this  product for 3 months now and I am very pleased with it. I started to notice changes on my hair 7 weeks after i started to use it and now the difference is obvious. No side effects so far. I feel my hair is much stronger than before. I hardly see any lost hair when I take shower. I used some other minoxidil products; I can say that this is the best hair lost product i have used so far. The price is very acceptable compared to the $35 a month supply for a plain minoxidil in my country.</li>
            <li> HI&lt;br /&gt;I just received and started using Lipogaine for men on the 12th July so it is too early to give a honest positive review of the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product did arrive well packaged and very quickly from supplier and will definitely use them again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using the product I have found it does make my hair slightly sticky but that’s not a problem I just brush the stickiness out when it dries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven’t experienced any itchiness or redness of the scalp only some minor shedding which is expected at this early point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to use Lipogaine and I will update progress of any regrowth of hair or any problems every 3 months</li>
            <li> I have used this product for over a year and am extremely impressed with the results.  This product outperforms the standard minoxidil solutions which produced disappointing results.  I could not be more pleased and impressed.  i will continue to order and use the product as it totally outperforms anything on the market.</li>
            <li> Works as described. ABout halfway through the 3 month supply and seeing noticeable results. Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Well, this stuff has worked pretty well for me. I am in the early stages of thinning and this stuff has definitely thickened my hair. I have probably been using this for over a year. I have gained some of the hair that I lost, but not all of it. I doubt any product could do that. I have however been able to keep all the remaining hairs and haven&#x27;t noticed any shedding. In fact, my hair is looking decently thick. I will continue to use this product until it is no longer working for me.</li>
            <li> Excellent product and highly recommended. I have been having hair loss problems due to genetic issues and had lost a large amount of hair. I tried so many different types of products but none of them seemed to actually help to regrow hair on the scalp. I tried Rogaine for a while but that wasn&#x27;t very helpful to me. After trying this product, I didn&#x27;t notice the change right away, but after a few months I could really tell the difference. My family and friends noticed it too. I couldn&#x27;t recommend it enough to those going through the same problem I am (the Lipogaine DHT blocking shampoo is wonderful too). I&#x27;m hopeful that even more hair will grow because when I massage my scalp, I can feel the baby hairs that weren&#x27;t there before. Great product and great service! I will continue ordering with them.</li>
            <li> I mixed it with powdered Azaleic Acid and is working much better.</li>
            <li> Just like many of you, I have tried various products in a quite consistent manner. I also used to spend an unspeakable amount of money at hair clinics where they cleanse your hair follicle and apply some tonic that&#x27;s not &amp;#34;yet&amp;#34; FDA approved. All of those didn&#x27;t work or were too costly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Lipogaine for Men works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use their shampoo either once a day or twice a day, and I always use their solution twice a day. That&#x27;s right, even if I don&#x27;t shampoo, I always use their solution. The reason I stick to &amp;#34;twice a day&amp;#34; regimen strictly is because if I miss once, I can feel some tension on my scalp, probably due to my hair follicles being filled up with DHT and all the garbage that DHT brings in. If applied once every 12 hours, I see less hair loss, and also less oil(?) on my scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An added bonus would be that this product makes styling easier. For instance, Rogaine, which is one of the alternatives, even w/ mousse type, make styling harder because your hair loses strength and looks &amp;#34;soggy&amp;#34;. No such problem with Lipogaine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, if any of you expect a quick result, don&#x27;t bother. This solution works, but only for those who are consistent in using the solution.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for around 2 months and I experience less hair falling, while seeing a &#x27;fuzz&#x27; appearing - mainly on the crown area - and darkening into good hair in the future.  I use it about twice a day - 8-9 hours apart - once in the morning and once in late-afternoon.  So far so good, even with a bad diet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only issue I have with this, you need to consistently use it and not stop, otherwise your hair will start falling out more than it was before.  So it&#x27;s a pretty a much life-time dedication.  I really wish to find a way to keep my new grown hair without having it fall out if I stop using this product...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will try to update with more results.</li>
            <li> overall, definitely the best hair loss treatment i have used.  i&#x27;ve been using this brand for about 5 years and i&#x27;ve been very happy with it.  does not itch the scalp or cause dandruff/flaking as much as other brands i used previously, and seems to be more effective in preventing hairline recession (my biggest problem area) than other brands.  as far as topical minoxidil formulas, this may be the best thing going right now.</li>
            <li> This did not regrow my hair. What&#x27;s worse, the last batch I purchased (a month ago) suddenly irritates my scalp, so I can&#x27;t use the 3 pack I bought. Do not buy this product.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend trying this product. It will not give you the hair you had as a child, but it will keep the hair you have and, genes permitting, facilitate some regrowth. Thankfully, in my case, it has maintained my hairline and allowed the hair on my crown to regrow to full concealment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I fully intend on continued usage.</li>
            <li> This is the best minoxidil because it doesn&#x27;t get greasy like the other ones with the dropper. I&#x27;ve tried the foams also and feel like they aren&#x27;t as effective and dry out too quickly. Would highly recommend this brand over rogaine and kirkland after trying them all</li>
            <li> Lipogaine + RegenePure Shampoo + Go Away Grey Capsules + IGrow Laser Helmet . Ive been using minoxidil for the last 8 years im happy with it but since ive been using these 4 combinations for the last 3 months, You believe me or not it doesnt affect me but im seeing the best result ever my hair used to fall out about 30 to 40 in a day but now tnx to Allah only like 5 to 10 .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way Go away grey its for ur hair to go back to its original colour but think again its full of vitamins for your hair and in the long run your hair never turns grey and it makes ur hair thicker aswel . peace out</li>
            <li> Ok I usually don&#x27;t right reviews. but I have hair again so Iam going to write for all you other bald men who want hair lol.I have been using this product for one month and my hair line is  coming back and thicker.my friend was using it and I lol at him.his hairline was in the middle of his head haha.6months later he sends a pic.holy crap! He had hair again.so that&#x27;s when I said I will try it.like I said 1 month later I seen a big difference.like I said thicker and my receding  &amp;#34;U&amp;#34;shaped hairline is coming back fast.this stuff really does work.can&#x27;t have all this positive without negative right??the negative about this product is that the bottle says it&#x27;s a 1month supply. It&#x27;s true if u have 1 bald spot.but like I said I have a U shape hairline and I want all my hair to get thicker so I put it all around my head.so in the morning I put it all around my head.mid day I put it on my U shap.at night I put it all around my head again I might be overdosing haha.but I have no side effects. my uncle also switched to lipogaine because he was on Rogaine and tried Kirkland brand but only got lil baby hairs.today was his first day using lipogaine so obviously no afro yet lol.hope this helps!</li>
            <li> Esperando resultados ...</li>
            <li> Had used rogaine foam for a number of years, which was okay, probably slowed hair loss, but lipogaine definitely is superior in that it did cause a decent amount of regrowth in the vertex, and regrowth at corners which rogaine hadn&#x27;t done in its many years of use. Would recommend.</li>
            <li> This product truly works for me.Been using it for about a year and a half.Easy to use and absolutely no side effects for me.The service by Lipogaine is excellent.</li>
            <li> Great product and works</li>
            <li> Having used this product for about 9 months, and having been skeptical at first, it works.  My wife and barber have both noticed the increased growth and I&#x27;m hopeful that the filling-in process will continue.  I truly like that it&#x27;s virtually odor-free and plan to continue using it.  Will admit I was discouraged at the 3 month point when I saw very little progress but stuck at it and am glad I did.</li>
            <li> Best product ever for new hair growth and fullness. Works great at the front of the hairline and the top. Like anything that works this well, give it a month or two to really see the great results. Will buy over and over again because my hair looks better and fuller now than when I was 25. Believe That!</li>
            <li> Been using for 4 months, didn&#x27;t want to write any review until after a few months because that&#x27;s how long it takes to see results. Don&#x27;t expect 1 month results because you will just be lying to yourself. Is why I bought the 3 pack.  .  25 Years old, noticed thinning hair(Male Pattern Baldness chart I I I A), quite obvious when it would dry clean could see parts of my scalp. Since using it, it&#x27;s grown hair everywhere I&#x27;ve put it on my scalp, can hardly find any thin spots. Fairly easy to apply, doesn&#x27;t smell too terrible, and doesn&#x27;t stain pillows or flake much. I have had 1 or 2 days (rare) of bad flaking but wasn&#x27;t anything to be concerned about.  .  Lipogane to work effectively MUST be used with a micro-needle derma roller. (0.50mm recommend). The derma roller allows the Minoxidil solution to be absorbed at roughly 10x the rate it would without it (so I&#x27;m told)  .  Also is making my beard much thicker and increased chest &amp; back hair since using it.  .  The only CON I can think of regarding Minoxidil in general is, it&#x27;s a life time commitment. If you get the hair growth you were after and stop, I&#x27;m told it will revert back to as if you never used it in the first place.  .  I haven&#x27;t used any other product in the past, but I did a lot of looking on the subject for what we could put on our scalps that would work the best. $33 dollars (Canadian), even less for Americans ($25) a month isn&#x27;t bad either for recovered confidence.  .  The bottles recommend twice a day 8 hours minimum between application, but I only use it once a day, sometimes I miss a day or two straight, still working!</li>
            <li> I have tried several minoxidil products throughout the years. This is the best one. Other products make my hair dry and crisp and I shed a lot. This is not the case with this product. I have not regrown any new hair, but that has been the case with anything I&#x27;ve used. This product at least makes the hair I do have appear thicker and prevents my hair loss from getting worse. It&#x27;s worth it for me to continue using this product to at least keep the hair I have left. I would recommend this over any minoxidil product or any product that claims to help for that matter.</li>
            <li> This is a really powerful substance for hair growth, it&#x27;s so powerful that it actually grows your eyebrow bushy, nose hair grows faster, facial hair grows faster, and some hairs appear in weird places in your face! I also did not see its effects on my scalp, my scalp was still receding. I used this for two months and just couldn&#x27;t continue to a third month because of the side effects.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t ask for a better product. From now on, I will use this to regain my hair. For anyone who is concerned about a receding hairline, I HIGHLY recommend you use this. I see brand new hair growth all over, especially in the receding area. Lipogaine delivers and they definitely have my future business!!</li>
            <li> It Works Great:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used several different hair oils/solutions over the years none  of them shown any results.Finally i have found Lipogaine that solve my hair loss problem. It is far superior to anything I have used in the past and believe you me I have spent many years &amp; 1000&#x27;s of $ on trying different hair regrowth products. It was worth going for Lipogaine. Its great product for complete hair hair problems.Try it you will definelty like this product.</li>
            <li> The best product by far and I have been using treatments for over 25 years.  I have been using Lipogaine for about a year now and it works noticeably better then when I used Kirkland 5% minoxidal only, especially in the front area where I now have hair regrowth. For front thinning or balding I have noticed great improvement. The product is always shipped fasted on time and packaged great. I would only recommend using it with the Micro needle too for even better results.  Outstanding product best on the market today.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about 2 years now.  I definitely like it better than minoxidil by itself. I feel like it is keeping the hair and hairline that I have.  I would recommend this product if you have a receding hairline and want to try to prevent further loss.</li>
            <li> Very effective and easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;You will see new hair growth after 3-months treatments!</li>
            <li> I have been extremely satisfied with this product, which I have been using for the past year. I used to use Kirkland&#x27;s Minoxidil and the Rogaine foam from CVS. Both worked on my hair in terms of regrowth, but made it appear very sticky or even made my hair have whitish flakes. This product does not leave any obvious residue on your hair, making it easy to use twice a day. Although more expensive than the competitors, the cosmetic difference is worth it in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I started to lose hair since I was 23. I used several different brands of straight 5% minxoidil for half a year. They were itchy, running on my face and took ages to dry. The worst part is that they didn&#x27;t work at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of my friends recommended try Lipogaine. I was skeptical in the beginning. 3 months later, I am a believer. In 3 months, I&#x27;ve had hair coming back on my head in places (in frontal and vertex) that I haven&#x27;t seen since I was 20 (I am in early 30s). It&#x27;s steadily getting thicker and darker too.  I have enough hair now that I actually have to be concerned about styling it every morning for the first time in years. This is all after only 3 months, which isn&#x27;t very long  into Lipogaine&#x27;s full effectiveness. And, as I get more hair and grow it longer, I have more options to style and cut it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short, Lipogaine worked for me while other regular minoxidil failed.  It worked on both receding hairlines and frontal hair loss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product has light yellow color. However, the yellow color is not noticeable at all after it is applied to the head. It does not smell, dries much faster than regular minoxidil, and does not cause itchiness as the regular minoxidil products do either.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work. Save your money</li>
            <li> I tried other 5% minoxidils but certainly this one works better for me. Dries faster than rogaine. When you start using it, it leaves a slight burning feeling on the scalp after application for about 15 minutes, which I think is another thing that shows it is working. But that feeling decreases by the time.&lt;br /&gt;I only use it at nights before I go to bed. Even when applying once a day, my shedding reduced significantly within 3 months and I started to see progress on my crown within 5-6 months. I can&#x27;t really say that I saw much improvement on the front line but soon I will start applying it twice a day along with 20% azelaic acid cream. Hopefully my results will get better. Definitely suggest using it if you can not get results from other brands.</li>
            <li> i dont know if i like it yet</li>
            <li> Took a 2 months to see results and almost gave up after significant shredding but kept with it and great results. The only product that has worked for me.</li>
            <li> Great product but really small bottles</li>
            <li> First of all, I am not sure yet if this product is going to regrow hair, since I just spent one month of using it. However, I can tell that it thickened my hair. It stops hair loss. It dries so fast, and it leaves your hair in a good shape after. I can tell that, comparing to other minoxidil brands I tried, this one is the most I liked in the terms I have just mentioned, and I consider it as the best quality. Still need more months to tell if it really works in regrowing hair or not. I will keep using it along with Lipogaine big 3 Shampoo for 6 more months and make my final judgment after.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been 6 mos and i don&#x27;t see a noticeable difference.  It dries a little faster, very relatively to other brands of plain minoxidil.  I&#x27;m going to give it another 3 mos.</li>
            <li> Got this for my husband a few weeks ago, and he already sees some new growth. He&#x27;s very happy with it.</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying that I am more than pleasantly surprised by the results I&#x27;ve experienced in using this product. I started out just over five months ago on trying to restore my thinning hair. Especially the barren patch in the back. I did a considerable amount of research before starting out and found that others had given high marks to Lipogaine for Men. I didn&#x27;t want to experiment with a number of costly products and procedures that may not work so I decided to follow the best reviews and the most favorable research recommendations. It turns out that everything I read was correct on all counts. In short, this stuff works!  I took photos of my head when I started and took some more just recently. The patch is the back is filling in at an excellent rate after just five months. I&#x27;ve got considerable restoral in that area and it&#x27;s not simply thin wispy hairs.  I&#x27;ve also used Lipogaine on the front area where I had a strip of hair that resembled a map of the lower part of Florida. That area has become fuller since using Lipogaine and there&#x27;s even new growth in and just to the front of the border that my hairline had receded to.  So, I highly recommend Lipogaine for Men and I definitely suggest that you use it in unison with the Lipogaine Big 3 Shampoo. The shampoo has made my hair fuller overall.  I&#x27;m going to try to attach a pic to this review so that you can see my results for yourself. They aren&#x27;t the greatest quality pics (cell phone in the bathroom mirror) but you can see the progress. I am fortunate to have started out with the right products (based on research) and don&#x27;t plan on changing anything at all. Best of luck to all who read this! Carl in Virginia</li>
            <li> I have been buying this product for many years now. I have found that if you use it on a regular basis ie  daily  every day of the year&lt;br /&gt;then it will at a minimum keep your hair staying at what I call a consistency that will prevent you loosing your hair. I have been lucky to have very thick hair but it has thinned out over time - as in Im now in my mid 50,s but still have a good head of hair. The product does leave a residue but after a few days you can just rinse it out, or if you live on the coast like me then just go for a swim in the ocean to clear your scalp or better still rinse with some apple cider vinegar. By using the solution along with other chinese natural medicine I have maintained my youth - by at least looking 10 years younger - just ask my son who everyone for years thinks we are bothers.&lt;br /&gt;ps make sure you try it  for at least 6 months before making any decisions and compliment it with plenty of healthy food.

            <li> I am the type of person that does an extensive amount of research before buying something, especially when I decided to buy something to start taking care of my thinning hair. I chose Lipogaine because it is only topical, as some of the ingested solutions can have seriously negative side effects. Also, not only does it have the active ingredient of minoxidil that increases blood flow to the area, but also other ingredients that like saw palmetto that help seed the scalp for hair growth as well.    I was 21 when I started using Lipogaine and have been for about 2 years now. I noticed results after about the first 3 months when it seemed my hair stopped falling out and baby hairs were noticeable. After 6 is when friends and my girlfriend started mentioning that my hair appeared to be thicker and fuller. Before I had to keep my hair very short in order not to accentuate my thinning, but now I can go to a barber and enjoy getting an undercut done. In order to truly get results and not lose them, you have to be strict on using Lipogaine twice a day EVERYDAY, otherwise it will stop working, and in fact your body will seem to want to make up for lost time and encourage your hair to fall out faster.    After combining the topical solution with the Big 3 shampoo, I have noticed that the my hair completely stops shedding altogether, nothing on my fingers when i run my hands through my hair in the shower. This product worked better than I had hoped and I encourage anyone to give it a try before resorting to riskier or more expensive solutions.</li>
            <li> It has the minoxidlil plus the acid for blocking DHT  and that is why i chose this product.  I apply it with a minixodil brush.  This way the product goes on your head and not in your hair.</li>
