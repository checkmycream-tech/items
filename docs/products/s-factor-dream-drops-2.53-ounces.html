            <li>Amazing scent does wonders on my brittle hair.</li>
            <li>Dream Drops smells DEVINE and it&#x27;s a nice</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s stayed nice for 3 days, which is unheard of for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>in fact, it is kind of &amp;#34;plastic-y&amp;#34; to me.</li>
            <li>I love love love this stuff!</li>
            <li>I love Dream Drops because it is not heavy like some oils, I like the way it makes my hair feel, and it smells wonderful!</li>
            <li>I bought this after reading all the great feedback on amazon and especially the comments about how great this smells.</li>
            <li>In general, the S Factor line is one of the best out there, and smells SO good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t make my hair oily like most serum&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;ll love it.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Sooo glad I found it on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I usually LOVE LOVE LOVE S Factor products</li>
            <li>I will have to buy more when I run out</li>
            <li>I tried applying it after conditioning and before blow drying and it looked OK then again</li>
            <li>Love the silkiness feels it feels in your hair.</li>
            <li>For the price I think I like the Garnier Fructis Sleek serum better.  </li>
            <li>Would highly recommend, and the price was great.  </li>
            <li>S-Factor Dream Drops make my hair look and feel soft and beautiful without frizz.</li>
            <li>I notice a HUGE difference when I dont use it or use something else.</li>
            <li>overall happy with the product.</li>
            <li>No more line, great color and SHINE!  </li>
            <li>perfect to add shine &amp; make hair less frizzy!!  </li>
            <li>I loved it so much I went straight home to amazon.com to buy it.  </li>
            <li>There really is nothing better.</li>
            <li>A stylist used this on my hair several years ago, and after trying a bunch out that did not smell or work as good, I went to the almighty internet to get a hold of this.</li>
            <li>Instead, your hair is shiny and full of body.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff, it makes my hair feel so much lighter and smoother.</li>
            <li>This has a lovely scent and seemed effective until around an hour after I applied it when my hair began to feel dry and flyaway.  </li>
            <li>It makes your hair super shiny and tames it.</li>
            <li>This and Paul Mitchell super skinny.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure if I could get it where I live.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s in beauty supply stores somewhere locally, but this price was great and it didn&#x27;t take too long to ship.</li>
            <li>Its worth a try for anyone experiementing with hair oils, or for anyone looking to expend on their s factor hair care collection.</li>
            <li>(the original moroccan oil is the very</li>
            <li>I have been using Rockaholic for a long while now and decided to switch it up; I&#x27;m so glad I did!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s job of smoothing down the frizz, but I prefer to stick with my Kerastase shining serum which actually does smell marvelous!</li>
            <li>I smells very sweet and it leaves your hair soft and shine like you just got it cut.</li>
            <li>I bought this for the first time when I was visiting family in West Palm Beach.</li>
            <li>even though the bottle is bigger, I don&#x27;t think I am getting a better value.</li>
            <li>this is exactly what I was looking for....</li>
            <li>Great product, gives you shine without being greasy or weighing your hair down!!!  </li>
            <li>color treated blonde, mid back length, fine but fairly</li>
            <li>I work in management at a large corporation and was worrying about the image I presented when meeting suppliers.  </li>
            <li>I really like this product</li>
            <li>, so much cheaper online.  </li>
            <li>Great for thin hair.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>I have very course hair</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s OK, S-Factor Dream Drops, you need to use on wet hair.  </li>
            <li>Very pleased with this product and this will last for a long  time as we&#x27;ll .</li>
            <li>But with a small amount of this, my hair was so nice after blow drying that I did not have to straighten it.</li>
            <li>An over-zealous colorist had heavily stripped my hair, then added more color.  </li>
            <li>It gives you a nice shine without being too thick.  </li>
            <li>: It&#x27;s a little sticky and it&#x27;s easy to use too much, causing my hair to look too oily.</li>
            <li>, so when I blow dry it, it&#x27;s typically pretty fluffy at the ends-Rockaholic tamed it to some extent, but I still had to straighten it to get it to lay nicely.</li>
            <li>I have tons of experience of hair care products and have a table full of them, but still got reeled in because a recent perm left my hair very frizzy.</li>
            <li>I have natural, curly hair with golden highlights and it&#x27;s the last product I use on my hair.</li>
            <li>price is fair for this item, and the small bottle lasts a really long time.</li>
            <li>Soft, SHINY hair!  </li>
            <li>be careful how much u use, because it will cause a buildup, don&#x27;t think i will purchase it again since my hair gets oily very fast with it</li>
            <li>Makes hair shiny and love you can use on wet or dry hair.</li>
            <li>May be old product.  </li>
            <li>Keeps your hair shiny and soft.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve only used about 1/8 of the whole bottle.</li>
            <li>Finally, what I dislike is the pump on this bottle - you cannot try to depress lightly to get smaller amounts out.</li>
            <li>We first started using this product about 7 years ago when a friend who was a hair stylist gave me a bottle; however, she passed away a few years ago, and I just now ran across that old bottle and decided to order it again.</li>
            <li>Three pumps a day is enough for my normal medium long hair.</li>
            <li>The few drops I rub into my hands and smooth over my wet hair seem to be sufficient to keep it from sticking out or otherwise misbehaving.</li>
            <li>It either does not dispense or presses down all the way and get a large dollop.</li>
            <li>oil is a bit heavier than I expected it to be, and doesn&#x27;t get absorbed into my hair as well as other oils Ive tried</li>
            <li>When the package arrived, it had leaked a bit, but not much product was wasted, just some clean up had to be done.</li>
            <li>My hair is naturally curly and dry.  </li>
            <li>My hair feels soft even after I blow dry it and flat iron it.</li>

            <li> My hair is naturally curly and dry.  </li>
            <li> My hair feels soft even after I blow dry it and flat iron it.</li>
            <li> I could barely get a wide tooth comb or brush through it.  </li>
            <li> after I flat ironed it but not now.</li>
            <li> Over several months the colored sections of my hair became like dry, frizzy cotton candy.  </li>
            <li> my hair began to feel and look dry and continued use of this actually seemed to be damaging my hair.  </li>
            <li> Though you can use it on dry hair, I only use it on damp hair before I blow dry my hair.</li>
            <li> I use this blow dry then flat iron</li>
            <li> The product lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> I wash and apply every morning, then blow dry and straighten.</li>
            <li> With Dream drops I apply, brush and let dry</li>
            <li> consistency.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have really dry hair (curly as well)</li>
            <li> and it use to feel dry</li>
            <li> If you use on dry hair your hair will look greasy.  </li>
            <li> I am a white dark brown hair woman .</li>
            <li> you only need a little , it would go a long way.</li>
            <li> Be careful only very little is needed and only use at end never on scalp area</li>
            <li> because it makes your hair shiny, it is not very greasy or oily.  </li>
            <li> simply squeeze a few drops onto damp hair before blow drying and voila...</li>
            <li> A ittle bit  of the product did leak but not much.</li>
            <li> towel dry my hair a little and then apply about 4 - 6</li>
            <li> I was a little worried purchasing online, I was afraid I might get a stale/older product since the price was so good, but I was completely wrong.</li>
            <li> Also, it feels like a slightly watered down version of my other smoothing/glossing serums so it spread a little easier, so</li>
            <li> everything less frizzy when I&#x27;m done blow</li>
            <li> Am I missing something here?</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this product.</li>
            <li> It comes in a deceivingly small bottle</li>
            <li> At half the price!!  </li>
            <li> I have thick wavy hair with a little frizz !</li>
            <li> I have thick hair</li>
            <li> Seriously.</li>
            <li> I was letting the color grow out, creating a definite line that was ugly and tacky.  </li>
            <li> I have very thick hair.  </li>
            <li> No fly aways, no stray hairs, nothing... just manageable hair.</li>
            <li> I tried this oil since I&#x27;m obsessed with S Factor diamond dreams shampoo and conditioner and serious conditioner.</li>
            <li> My stylist recommended this product and I was daunted by the $20 price tag but was desperate.  </li>
            <li> It was that bad that I had to wash it off my hair immediately.</li>
            <li> The smell is absolutely awful.</li>
            <li> but this was the worst smelling thing I have ever smelled....</li>

            <li> I use this product every morning... 4 squirts now that my hair is longer. I get compliments on the condition of my hair all the time. I wash and apply every morning, then blow dry and straighten. I get the desired results everytime. I&#x27;m not even kidding. No fly aways, no stray hairs, nothing... just manageable hair. I notice a HUGE difference when I dont use it or use something else. There really is nothing better.</li>
            <li> Does not seem to work for me.  I notice no difference when used.  I purchased because others have reviewed it favorably.  May be old product.  I called TIGI to help find expire date, but they do not have one as customer rep said, and no warranty on products ordered online.  Warranty only applies for products purchased in salons.</li>
            <li> I really like this product because it makes your hair shiny, it is not very greasy or oily.  It smoothes your hair and it smells SO GOOD!</li>
            <li> I was a little worried purchasing online, I was afraid I might get a stale/older product since the price was so good, but I was completely wrong. Product was the same as if I purchased at the salon. Will now buy on Amazon and save a ton of money.</li>
            <li> be careful how much u use, because it will cause a buildup, don&#x27;t think i will purchase it again since my hair gets oily very fast with it</li>
            <li> Keeps your hair shiny and soft.</li>
            <li> Seriously. I use this stuff on my hair every day and just like all of S-Factor&#x27;s products it smells heavenly! It doesn&#x27;t make my hair oily like most serum&#x27;s. This stuff fulfills what it promises. It comes in a deceivingly small bottle and I say deceivingly because it lasts forever!! I&#x27;ve been using it every day (three pumps) for 4 months and I&#x27;ve only used about 1/8 of the whole bottle. Three pumps a day is enough for my normal medium long hair. It makes my hair so shiny and manageable. I could go all day. This stuff does not dissappoint! If yo&#x27;ure in doubt.. buy it. you&#x27;ll love it.</li>
            <li> This product works wonders for thick/bushy hair... simply squeeze a few drops onto damp hair before blow drying and voila... sleek hair that does not look like it has a ton of product in it! I love this product.</li>
            <li> The smell is absolutely awful. It reminds me of a molded bathroom or rotten fruit. It was that bad that I had to wash it off my hair immediately. Am I missing something here? Am I the only one who doesn&#x27;t like it?</li>
            <li> I have been using these dream drops for years.  Love the shine it puts on my hair, takes out the frizz and smells delicious!  Would highly recommend, and the price was great.  When the package arrived, it had leaked a bit, but not much product was wasted, just some clean up had to be done.</li>
            <li> Great stuff.  I have very thick hair.  I put it on after I get out of the shower.&lt;br /&gt;I towel dry my hair a little and then apply about 4 - 6 pumps.&lt;br /&gt;Keeps everything less frizzy when I&#x27;m done blow drying.&lt;br /&gt;Plus, so much cheaper online.  I buy local amazon gift cards at the grocery store.&lt;br /&gt;Get extra fuel points that way, hopeful keeping things local that way and then apply the total to my amazon acct.&lt;br /&gt;Perfect.  Also, get credit to my fundraising at school too buying the gift cards local.</li>
            <li> Smells and looks great. A stylist used this on my hair several years ago, and after trying a bunch out that did not smell or work as good, I went to the almighty internet to get a hold of this. I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s in beauty supply stores somewhere locally, but this price was great and it didn&#x27;t take too long to ship.</li>
            <li> Great product, gives you shine without being greasy or weighing your hair down!!!  And it smells wonderful!!!  S-factor is awesome!</li>
            <li> I have thick wavy hair with a little frizz ! S-Factor Dream Drops make my hair look and feel soft and beautiful without frizz. if I iron my hair and use Dream Drops I always get complements!!</li>
            <li> I like Dream Drops.  It gives you a nice shine without being too thick.  The product lasts a long time.  I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> Love it! Smells gook and doesn&#x27;t make my hair look greasy</li>
            <li> A hair stylist used this on my hair at the end of a recent haircut.  I loved it so much I went straight home to amazon.com to buy it.  Sometimes these oil based hair products make your hair look greasy and stringy.  This product doesn&#x27;t!  Instead, your hair is shiny and full of body.  Will definitely buy again (as soon as my bottle starts running low.)  Though you can use it on dry hair, I only use it on damp hair before I blow dry my hair.</li>
            <li> I love this product !!! I bought this for the first time when I was visiting family in West Palm Beach. I wasn&#x27;t sure if I could get it where I live. Sooo glad I found it on Amazon. At half the price!!  Great product. I would order again</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product off and on over the years. It helps detangle your hair and leaves a light-weight, non-greasy, silky feeling when used in relative moderation.  The few drops I rub into my hands and smooth over my wet hair seem to be sufficient to keep it from sticking out or otherwise misbehaving.</li>
            <li> I have natural, curly hair with golden highlights and it&#x27;s the last product I use on my hair. It truly makes the color in my curls pop and also adds extra moisture I need.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this product and this will last for a long  time as we&#x27;ll . Be careful only very little is needed and only use at end never on scalp area otherwise you will get greasy hair look and feel . I use this blow dry then flat iron I am a white dark brown hair woman .</li>
            <li> My aunt use it when i used to get haircuts, I started to used it after that. you only need a little , it would go a long way. I smells very sweet and it leaves your hair soft and shine like you just got it cut.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff, been using it for years!  Even bought a bottle for a friend and she loves it!</li>
            <li> I usually LOVE LOVE LOVE S Factor products but this was the worst smelling thing I have ever smelled....do not understand it</li>
            <li> Gift for Christmas, she loves it.</li>
            <li> I love S-factor Dream drops!  My hair is naturally curly and dry.  With Dream drops I apply, brush and let dry and my hair is not frizzy.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, it makes my hair feel so much lighter and smoother. Great for thin hair. I will have to buy more when I run out</li>
            <li> I tried this oil since I&#x27;m obsessed with S Factor diamond dreams shampoo and conditioner and serious conditioner. In general, the S Factor line is one of the best out there, and smells SO good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This oil is nice...has a great smell, and adds moisture to your hair, but it isn&#x27;t the best oil I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair: color treated blonde, mid back length, fine but fairly thick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The oil is a bit heavier than I expected it to be, and doesn&#x27;t get absorbed into my hair as well as other oils Ive tried (the original moroccan oil is the very best)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price is fair for this item, and the small bottle lasts a really long time. Its worth a try for anyone experiementing with hair oils, or for anyone looking to expend on their s factor hair care collection.</li>
            <li> Best hair product I have ever used!</li>
            <li> I have been using Rockaholic for a long while now and decided to switch it up; I&#x27;m so glad I did! Dream Drops smells DEVINE and it&#x27;s a nice consistency.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have really dry hair (curly as well), so when I blow dry it, it&#x27;s typically pretty fluffy at the ends-Rockaholic tamed it to some extent, but I still had to straighten it to get it to lay nicely. But with a small amount of this, my hair was so nice after blow drying that I did not have to straighten it. And it&#x27;s stayed nice for 3 days, which is unheard of for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really recommend this stuff!</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing! It makes your hair super shiny and tames it. Use sparingly, 1 or 2 drops is good.. Enjoy, I know I have!!</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing &amp; smells divine!  My friends kept grabbing &amp; smelling my hair!  I love love love this stuff!</li>
            <li> wasn&#x27;t what I thought it was</li>
            <li> I love Dream Drops because it is not heavy like some oils, I like the way it makes my hair feel, and it smells wonderful!</li>
            <li> I bought this after reading all the great feedback on amazon and especially the comments about how great this smells. I have tons of experience of hair care products and have a table full of them, but still got reeled in because a recent perm left my hair very frizzy. To me, this product does not smell particularly good - in fact, it is kind of &amp;#34;plastic-y&amp;#34; to me. Also, it feels like a slightly watered down version of my other smoothing/glossing serums so it spread a little easier, so even though the bottle is bigger, I don&#x27;t think I am getting a better value. Finally, what I dislike is the pump on this bottle - you cannot try to depress lightly to get smaller amounts out. It either does not dispense or presses down all the way and get a large dollop. I have very short hair and feel like I am wasting a lot. All in all, it does do it&#x27;s job of smoothing down the frizz, but I prefer to stick with my Kerastase shining serum which actually does smell marvelous!</li>
            <li> I have thick hair so a serum is essential for me. I only use two products and I alternate between them. This and Paul Mitchell super skinny. This stuff smells so amazing, my husband can&#x27;t stop sniffing my hair. My stylist has me hooked. I would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> Amazing scent does wonders on my brittle hair. Fast shipping. Thanks</li>
            <li> My stylist recommended this product and I was daunted by the $20 price tag but was desperate.  An over-zealous colorist had heavily stripped my hair, then added more color.  Over several months the colored sections of my hair became like dry, frizzy cotton candy.  I could barely get a wide tooth comb or brush through it.  I had tried lots of different conditioners but to no avail.  I was letting the color grow out, creating a definite line that was ugly and tacky.  I work in management at a large corporation and was worrying about the image I presented when meeting suppliers.  I had to do something.  My stylist recommended coloring (eek) and Dream Drops.  So I decided to try it.  This stuff works!  It works!  After three weeks my hair feels like silk! No more line, great color and SHINE!  Soft, SHINY hair!  The downside: It&#x27;s a little sticky and it&#x27;s easy to use too much, causing my hair to look too oily. There&#x27;s a learning curve. Try starting use on a weekend when you can experiment.</li>
            <li> This has a lovely scent and seemed effective until around an hour after I applied it when my hair began to feel dry and flyaway.  I tried applying it after conditioning and before blow drying and it looked OK then again my hair began to feel and look dry and continued use of this actually seemed to be damaging my hair.  I have to throw it out. Don&#x27;t waste your money on this product.</li>
            <li> This was recommended to me by my step daughter and it is great. My hair feels soft even after I blow dry it and flat iron it. I have very course hair and it use to feel dry after I flat ironed it but not now. I would recommend this for anyone with course hair.</li>
            <li> Makes hair shiny and love you can use on wet or dry hair. Love the silkiness feels it feels in your hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s OK, S-Factor Dream Drops, you need to use on wet hair.  If you use on dry hair your hair will look greasy.  For the price I think I like the Garnier Fructis Sleek serum better.  For a pricier version I like using the Kenra smoothing serum.</li>
            <li> A ittle bit  of the product did leak but not much. overall happy with the product. Smells really good too!-</li>
            <li> this is exactly what I was looking for....perfect to add shine &amp; make hair less frizzy!!  thank you</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair nice and shiney , great smell</li>
            <li> We first started using this product about 7 years ago when a friend who was a hair stylist gave me a bottle; however, she passed away a few years ago, and I just now ran across that old bottle and decided to order it again. Thankfully it&#x27;s still being produced and sold. It&#x27;s better than ever and the bottle design from dripper to pump is an excellent design change.</li>
