            <li>I full agree!</li>
            <li>The mascara stayed all day and was easy to remove.</li>
            <li>my eyes get irritated easy from makeup</li>
            <li>I have always used make up removed pads and it removes easily with pads, some use face wash/soap/water.</li>
            <li>my lashes looked huge and it was so easy to put on...</li>
            <li>We had gone to a wedding &amp; saw it on a few bridesmaidseconds &amp; was impressed .</li>
            <li>What a timesaver!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks again for such a great product.</li>
            <li>I called my sister right away, because she does the extensions and told her she would be way better off buying this product.  </li>
            <li>Those others were OK, but these are just WOW!!!!  </li>
            <li>When i bought this the first time from a local seller ,it worked great ,</li>
            <li>I thought I would like it more, but not so much.</li>
            <li>I love them, and I got them right away, they really work</li>
            <li>Received this in 4 business days and it&#x27;s exactly what I wanted!</li>
            <li>Worked really well!!</li>
            <li>I knew as soon as I used this mascara the first time, all ladies would want it!</li>
            <li>Fantastic,  really works.</li>
            <li>I think it gives a fuller and more natural llook.</li>
            <li>I read other reviews of people stating they loved the product .</li>
            <li>The rep said I had done it right.</li>
            <li>To me it doesn&#x27;t work any better then regular mascara.</li>
            <li>Shipping was so fast!</li>
            <li>(and it is ONLY guaranteed to be an authentic younique product when bought through a rep)</li>
            <li>Most days I only apply 1 coat per eye.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not even funny.</li>
            <li>I bought it form a Younique representative and my lashes looked amazing the first time I used it and crappy every other time.</li>
            <li>Pretty good, not sure just yet if I will purchase again...</li>
            <li>Love this 3D fiber, my lashes looked so long</li>
            <li>Easy to wear, long lasting, and easy to remove.</li>
            <li>The fibers  irritated my eyes so much that they gave me a corneal abrasion .</li>
            <li>for the real stuff.</li>
            <li>Also, I have very oily skin</li>
            <li>to get the real deal I ordered mine from[...]</li>
            <li>Thank you very much.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li>I only wear it for special occasions.  </li>
            <li>Works very week makes your eye lashes look full and long</li>
            <li>you are feeling a little bare in your lashes, I promise you, you will LOVE this product!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li>Very natural looking  &amp; no irritation.</li>
            <li>All my friends wanted to use the same mascara and all if them told me I could be the model for these mascara because my eyes and lashes were Anaaaaziingg ;)</li>
            <li>Bought one for myself &amp; my 17 yr old granddaughter.</li>
            <li>I have short lashes so this product really helped a lot.</li>
            <li>It also looked natural when I wore it.</li>
            <li>And its all natural and hypoallergenic.</li>
            <li>I was surprised that the fibers did not irritate my eyes.</li>
            <li>but younique is all natural and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin....</li>
            <li>Wow, is all I can say.</li>
            <li>However,  it&#x27;s so much cheaper (and you get the return policy) if you buy it through a verified independent presenter!  </li>
            <li>Also, if you have even slightly sensitive eyes, this product is not for you.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s funny, because this product seems to fall off all over my face all day long</li>
            <li>ARRIVED LATE, OTHER WISE</li>
            <li>Lashes only available in the color black, therefore if you need a brown color you much apply your regular mascara to soften the look.  </li>
            <li>far, I&#x27;ve only done 2 coats per eye although the instructions say you can do 3.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really see any difference compared to regular mascara once it was dry.  </li>
            <li>The downside is that through out the day my eyes get very irritated from the little fibers getting into your eyes.</li>
            <li>Works very well, takes a little longer to apply than just mascara.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> However,  it&#x27;s so much cheaper (and you get the return policy) if you buy it through a verified independent presenter!  </li>
            <li> Also, if you have even slightly sensitive eyes, this product is not for you.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s funny, because this product seems to fall off all over my face all day long</li>
            <li> ARRIVED LATE, OTHER WISE</li>
            <li> Lashes only available in the color black, therefore if you need a brown color you much apply your regular mascara to soften the look.  </li>
            <li> far, I&#x27;ve only done 2 coats per eye although the instructions say you can do 3.</li>

            <li> The downside is that through out the day my eyes get very irritated from the little fibers getting into your eyes.</li>
            <li> Works very well, takes a little longer to apply than just mascara.</li>
            <li> I normally have short, blonde, wimpy, sparse lashes, but no more.</li>
            <li> I use this mascara when I want full dramatic lashes.</li>
            <li> So it cost a fortune in long run.</li>
            <li> As I&#x27;ve gotten older my lashes have lost volume even with standard mascara &amp; although I wear individual lashes for special occasions, I hate the heaviness &amp; the &amp;#34;fake&amp;#34; look they can sometime have.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The mascara stays put, is easy to apply, and I will keep using the product as long as they keep making it!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Not only does this product not give you the dark circles under the eyes...</li>
            <li> I am a little irritated that I paid $28 +$5 s&amp;h last week and</li>
            <li> , it is hypoallergenic, it&#x27;s sweat proof, water resistant and lasts all day long!!!</li>
            <li> It would take a long time to put coat after coat of mascara on with my usual brand, now I only need two coats of Moonstruck.</li>
            <li> NOT REAL.</li>
            <li> Received my 3D fiber lashes before the expected delivery date.</li>
            <li> Monet well spent</li>
            <li> It will irritate them, and if you do not remove it the night before you will wake up looking like you have pink eye.</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;ll be buying this mascara for life, so much easier than false lashes</li>
            <li> I just bought it the other day</li>
            <li> I even temporarily lost vision in my eye due to the fibers.</li>
            <li> I would use extreme caution if buying this product.</li>
            <li> Do you have endless amount of time to spend applying mascara and re-touching your make-up?</li>
            <li> I used the product two days ago and my eyes are still not right.</li>
            <li> Its not worth the money.</li>
            <li> I paid months for lash extensions, until my lashes started falling out, then the glues from falsies bothered my eyes, plus my eye lids always felt weighted down wearing falsies.</li>
            <li> I agree with other customers, why waste money on the packaging.</li>
            <li> They do provide extension but it is really little.</li>
            <li> Adds and lengths my lashes,  but can get clumpy and I need to comb it out which helps a little</li>
            <li> The look is of real, long, thick lashes.  </li>
            <li> I will never use any other mascara!!</li>
            <li> I had to practice a few times to get the hang of it</li>
            <li> wore off after a few hours and made my eyes itch.  </li>
            <li> I use this mascara everyday...</li>
            <li> At least they take less that 2 minutes to apply.</li>
            <li> , I had just thought that morning I was going to try out fake lashes again because regular mascara was just not doing it anymore since I have been in my 30&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> What a mess!!</li>
            <li> the black marks under the eyes are not attractive.  </li>
            <li> This had hardly any fibers to it, ,</li>
            <li> I could hardly believe it.</li>

            <li> Received this in 4 business days and it&#x27;s exactly what I wanted! Used it today for the first time and have gotten so many compliments on my lashes! Definitely lengthens and thickens my somewhat short, blonde lashes. I think I&#x27;ll be buying this mascara for life, so much easier than false lashes and it looks almost the same! Every girl should have this in their Makeup Arsenal! I am a little irritated that I paid $28 +$5 s&amp;h last week and this week it&#x27;s only $21. That&#x27;s the only reason I gave it 4 stars.</li>
            <li> I hate wearing mascara because of the way my eyes look after a long day... the black marks under the eyes are not attractive.  Not only does this product not give you the dark circles under the eyes... It makes your eyes look AMAZING!!!!</li>
            <li> I AM IN ASOLUTE LOVE WITH THIS MASCARA!!!! I highly recommend it to anyone. I just bought it the other day and I just can not believe how my lashes look. I called my sister right away, because she does the extensions and told her she would be way better off buying this product.  My lashes look amazing and I am awe over this mascara! HIGHLY HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!!!</li>
            <li> They are OK, not as glamorous as everyone makes it seem. They do provide extension but it is really little. I had to sit there and keep applying the fibers for a good 15 minutes to get the look I was going for  and then had to separate them to make sure it didn&#x27;t turn out clumpy. By all means, it did not look or feel like it the pictures posted. 15 minutes...I would rather have put on lashes. For the price I would buy the YSL babydoll mascara or stick to a L&#x27;Oreal million lashes. At least they take less that 2 minutes to apply. Not impressed at all.</li>
            <li> We had gone to a wedding &amp; saw it on a few bridesmaidseconds &amp; was impressed . Bought one for myself &amp; my 17 yr old granddaughter. I can&#x27;t wait 2 give it to her as one of her many presents</li>
            <li> Lashes only available in the color black, therefore if you need a brown color you much apply your regular mascara to soften the look.  After having the lashes on for 4 or so hours, the fibers seem to flake off and  get into your eyes causing some  discomfort.</li>
            <li> It works well, just as described. I only wear it for special occasions.  Wish there were more fibers included though.</li>
            <li> Pretty good, not sure just yet if I will purchase again...</li>
            <li> It does what its suppose to do,  it enhances your eyelashes. The downside is that through out the day my eyes get very irritated from the little fibers getting into your eyes.</li>
            <li> It was easy to use and it met my expectations and more ... All my friends wanted to use the same mascara and all if them told me I could be the model for these mascara because my eyes and lashes were Anaaaaziingg ;)</li>
            <li> This makes my lashes look clumped and like spider legs, and the gel mascara burns the crap out of my eyes. I bought it form a Younique representative and my lashes looked amazing the first time I used it and crappy every other time. I&#x27;ll try it again but I am unimpressed and disappointed.</li>
            <li> Its not worth the money. To me it doesn&#x27;t work any better then regular mascara.</li>
            <li> When i bought this the first time from a local seller ,it worked great , This had hardly any fibers to it, ,</li>
            <li> Fantastic,  really works. I feel like I have eyelashes now. Only downside is not only did I pay for product and postage I had to pay another £11 for customs before I could have it. So it cost a fortune in long run. Have ordered more from uk seller since.</li>
            <li> I have short lashes so this product really helped a lot. It also looked natural when I wore it. So yes I loved it and will be ordering again :)</li>
            <li> I love it!! Made my eyelashes look long and thick!!! Recommend to everyone</li>
            <li> Shipping was so fast! Received item before the expect delivery date.  I love this product. I had to practice a few times to get the hang of it so it didnt look clumped together.  I also think it looks best when mascara is applied first. I think it gives a fuller and more natural llook.</li>
            <li> Holy MOLY! $42? Seriously? NO WAY. It is an Awesome mascara. Quality can not be beat! And it makes your lashes dramatically longer and thicker. And its all natural and hypoallergenic. However I can buy it WAY cheaper ($29) through my sales rep (and it is ONLY guaranteed to be an authentic younique product when bought through a rep)</li>
            <li> What a mess!! It kept getting all over my hands &amp; hair. I did manage to get some on my lashes :). I did the 3 coats as suggested. It did flake &amp; get in my eyes. The rep said I had done it right. I agree with other customers, why waste money on the packaging. It is ridiculously expensive. I finally got the stuff off of my hands after washing w/ lots of soap.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen this brand advertised on Instagram &amp; I always believed the pictures were the results of experienced makeup artists. As I&#x27;ve gotten older my lashes have lost volume even with standard mascara &amp; although I wear individual lashes for special occasions, I hate the heaviness &amp; the &amp;#34;fake&amp;#34; look they can sometime have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far, I&#x27;ve only done 2 coats per eye although the instructions say you can do 3. Most days I only apply 1 coat per eye. Very natural looking  &amp; no irritation.</li>
            <li> This company is a fraud! The quality of this product can not be guaranteed! Only a registered Younique presenter is allowed to sell this product. This is illegal!</li>
            <li> If I could give no stars I would.  I followed the directions for this product to a T.  The fibers  irritated my eyes so much that they gave me a corneal abrasion . I even temporarily lost vision in my eye due to the fibers. I used the product two days ago and my eyes are still not right. They are red, severely blood shot and sore. I read other reviews of people stating they loved the product . I was very disappointed. I would use extreme caution if buying this product. It will damage your eyes</li>
            <li> Purchase your 3D Fiber Lashes from a Younique Presenter!  They&#x27;re amazing!  www.youniqueproducts.com/sarahkabbe</li>
            <li> I happened to walk by a booth at a local festival and they were selling this item. It seemed like they were there for me, I had just thought that morning I was going to try out fake lashes again because regular mascara was just not doing it anymore since I have been in my 30&#x27;s. It was SIMPLE, IMMEDIATE AND BEAUTIFUL! I will buy again...and again....and again...(you&#x27;ve got the point).&lt;br /&gt;If you are feeling a little bare in your lashes, I promise you, you will LOVE this product!</li>
            <li> I use this mascara when I want full dramatic lashes. It&#x27;s a wonderful mascara. No need for false lashes</li>
            <li> Works very week makes your eye lashes look full and long</li>
            <li> NOT REAL. THIS IS FAKE FROM CHINA. You must buy from younique representer for USA made products and guaranteed love it or return it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;www.3dlashesbyjahira.com for the real stuff.</li>
            <li> This stuff is AMAZING!!!! I love my eyes again! You have to try it to believe it!! I will never use any other mascara!!</li>
            <li> I was surprised that the fibers did not irritate my eyes. The mascara stayed all day and was easy to remove.</li>
            <li> Received my 3D fiber lashes before the expected delivery date. They are well beyond my expectations. Easy to wear, long lasting, and easy to remove. I love them &amp; will order more!!</li>
            <li> I love them, and I got them right away, they really work</li>
            <li> I get compliments on my lashes all the time</li>
            <li> I saw this online, and found it on Amazon. The product was shipped promptly, the packaging was beautiful, and instructions were clear. I have ok lashes, but now......THEY ARE GORGEOUS AND FULL!!!!! Also, I have very oily skin and I was afraid that the mascara would end up under my eyes, like it usually does. Not so! The mascara stays put, is easy to apply, and I will keep using the product as long as they keep making it!!!!!!!!!!! It would take a long time to put coat after coat of mascara on with my usual brand, now I only need two coats of Moonstruck. What a timesaver!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks again for such a great product. I see there are cheaper versions but I will stick to this one!</li>
            <li> wore off after a few hours and made my eyes itch.  Didn&#x27;t really see any difference compared to regular mascara once it was dry.  Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Love this 3D fiber, my lashes looked so long that friend though I had false lashes on or extensions. Comes off like waterproof mascara, wears well.</li>
            <li> I am not happy with this product.  I don&#x27;t like spending the time it takes to apply this mascara.  I thought I would like it more, but not so much.</li>
            <li> Worked really well!! This product is awesome! Monet well spent</li>
            <li> I read about these after trying a cheaper version of fiber lashes.  Those others were OK, but these are just WOW!!!!  I&#x27;ve never had to use more than one coat, but some users use more.  The look is of real, long, thick lashes.  I will keep buying these.... wish I&#x27;d known about them sooner. I could have saved a ton of money on mascara that now I no longer will use!</li>
            <li> I use this mascara everyday...my eyes get irritated easy from makeup but younique is all natural and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin....my lashes looked huge and it was so easy to put on...you can buy them for $29 through younique here&#x27;s the link.... youniqueproducts.com/meglichtenberger</li>
            <li> ARRIVED LATE, OTHER WISE THE PRODUCT IS GOOD</li>
            <li> Very good im so happy</li>
            <li> Adds and lengths my lashes,  but can get clumpy and I need to comb it out which helps a little</li>
            <li> Wow, is all I can say. I got this 3D Fiber Mascara for Mother&#x27;s Day! I Love mascara&#x27;s and I have tried so many it&#x27;s not even funny. I applied it as soon as I opened it up...Before my eyes, my lashes were growing in front of me. I could hardly believe it. I normally have short, blonde, wimpy, sparse lashes, but no more. I love this 3D Fiber Mascara. I paid months for lash extensions, until my lashes started falling out, then the glues from falsies bothered my eyes, plus my eye lids always felt weighted down wearing falsies. I knew as soon as I used this mascara the first time, all ladies would want it! I have since had several family and friends try it as well at my home, and they are blown away how it just pops their eyes open. All you can do is try it, if you don&#x27;t love it, with this mascara there is a 14 day return policy. I have sensitive eyes, its great for contact lens wearers, it is hypoallergenic, it&#x27;s sweat proof, water resistant and lasts all day long!!! I have always used make up removed pads and it removes easily with pads, some use face wash/soap/water. Try it, and what I like best, you order today, and you will recieve in 3-4 days via the mail. It truly is the best mascara I have ever used, I am being sincere! It works!!! I ordered mine from [...]; for $29 mine has lasted 3 1/2 months...if you apply it correctly it won&#x27;t flake off...always apply the gel, fibers then the gel to seal the fibers, and apply a second coat, depending upon the look and length you want. I heard the 3D Fiber mascara saying it was Younique, that is sold on Amazon is a knock off, so beward..to get the real deal I ordered mine from[...]</li>
            <li> Works very well, takes a little longer to apply than just mascara.</li>
            <li> Younique&#x27;s 3D Fiber Lash Mascara is amazing,  I full agree! However,  it&#x27;s so much cheaper (and you get the return policy) if you buy it through a verified independent presenter!  DO NOT buy this off Amazon!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[...] is where you need to be ordering from.</li>
            <li> Younique&#x27;s 3D Fiber Lashes work wonderfully and increase your eyelashes by up to 300%. You can even get it cheaper through Younique&#x27;s website for $29 and it comes their Love It Guarantee. If you spend $100.00 or more, then you get free shipping. To learn more, see comment.</li>
            <li> I bought this product from a younique seller, not on amazon. After using it for a month, I feel compelled to write a review. Do you have endless amount of time to spend applying mascara and re-touching your make-up? If so, then this product is for you. For starters, it is very tedious to apply. I found I had residue under my eyes even when doing only one swipe with the fibers. I also found that the product seemed to bleed under my eye even after I finished applying the final gel layer. Also, if you have even slightly sensitive eyes, this product is not for you. It will irritate them, and if you do not remove it the night before you will wake up looking like you have pink eye. Which reminds me, removing the mascara... It&#x27;s funny, because this product seems to fall off all over my face all day long and I continuously am doing the sweep under my eyes so I don&#x27;t look like a raccoon. But when you actually want the product to come off? Good luck.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m never one to be wasteful but I gave this a fair shot and feel it belongs in the garbage. I&#x27;ll be going back to my Diorshow mascara, which takes a fraction of the time.</li>
            <li> Well received items. Wonderful mascara. Interesting price. Very happy. Thank you very much.&lt;br /&gt;And my apologies for the delay in the review.</li>
