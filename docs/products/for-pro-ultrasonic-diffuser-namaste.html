            <li>You get a good amount of mist on the highest setting, but instead of an hour, the water will be used up in about 50 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>I was provided a free diffuser in exchange for my fair and honest review.</li>
            <li>It looks premium (wood finish) and puts out a very strong mist, and I like the fact that the measuring cup is built in.  </li>
            <li>This is the latest I tried.</li>
            <li>You can decrease the mist intensity and get a bit more.</li>
            <li>So it is safe for work unless people complain about your favorite scent.</li>
            <li>It does an excellent job of dispersing essential oils for aromatherapy, and it shuts itself off when it runs out of water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>you intend to position this somewhere in the background, then maybe the offending LEDs won&#x27;t seem so prominent.  </li>

            <li>Love these, but the sensor seems to be off.</li>
            <li>The inside diffusing cap on most diffusers attach to the inside top of the outer cover.</li>
            <li>It will stop diffusing and blink even when it&#x27;s still full!</li>
            <li>This is a fairly easy to use diffuser.</li>
            <li>but once you figure it our it is easy on successive attempts.</li>
            <li>Good deodorant smells include oil of rose, (yin, very spiritual), or Patchouli oil (yang in quality</li>
            <li>so this may not be the best choice for a dark</li>
            <li>Aromatherapy is fine art for the nose.</li>
            <li>/&gt;You can run this without the light</li>
            <li>I have a whole collection of diffusers, and this is a nice one compared to the rest.  </li>
            <li>Feel free to ask a question in the comments section</li>
            <li>The light button automatically loops colors, but you can hit it again to &#x27;lock in&#x27; a preferred color, or again to turn the lights</li>
            <li>Unlike others, I don’t mind the indicator warning light although there should be an option to turn off that light if you choose.</li>
            <li>I love these changing, colorful LED fixtures:  </li>
            <li>But there is something about this light and diffuser that is distracting....</li>
            <li>Why not put this distracting stuff on the backside of the light, alongside the port for the adapter?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>When it runs out of water, the STOP light flashes.</li>
            <li>Colored light turns itself on (flashes) and diffuser turns itself off.</li>
            <li>This works great with fragrance oils and essential oils.</li>
            <li>When diffuser is out of water, the &amp;#34;stop&amp;#34; light flashes.</li>
            <li>/&gt;We received this item as a gift (free or at a discount) with no promise of posting a review.  </li>
            <li>Every diffuser I&#x27;ve ever seen or reviewed, has something about it that makes it unique.</li>
            <li>It is recommended to clean the tank weekly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;There are two buttons both nicely and clearly labeled mist and light.</li>
            <li>For example, it would be great during a yoga practice or meditation session, where you would be running it for a limited time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product provided by the seller for evaluation purposes.</li>
            <li>You can rotate through the colors or fix on one special color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So if you are looking for a more intense experience, this may be the diffuser you want.</li>
            <li>A full tank will provide about three to six hours of mist.</li>
            <li>Women love Ylang-Ylang oil, which smells very close to Jasmine.</li>
            <li>Women love Ylang-Ylang oil, which smells very close to Jasmine.</li>
            <li>This is a very pretty diffuser, the light colored imitation wood grain on the bottom looks very nice.</li>
            <li>(Right below the MIST and LIGHT indicator lights, between the buttons.)  </li>
            <li>You can use it with the light off, you can run it with a steady light, or you can run it with the light changing in a loop.</li>
            <li>The instruction manual was clearly written and actually useful, which is nice for a change.</li>
            <li>but if you are going to use the light, this diffuser has a huge lighted area -- basically the whole plastic part showing in the product images.</li>
            <li>In a while) and quickly sends out the vapor.</li>
            <li>This aromatherapy vessel is sharp looking and has a very nice contoured shape as I look at it from all angles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So much information can be found on line on aromatherapy, however, drop me a line in the  comments if you need a bit of info, and I&#x27;ll do my best to help you.&lt;br /&gt;I was provided a free diffuser in exchange for my fair and honest review.rose, (yin, very spiritual), or Patchouli oil (yang in quality, you will either love or hate the smell.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and I really like</li>
            <li>The light button can be changed to rotate all colors or a certain color or off.</li>
            <li>Mesmerizing and soothing--usually.  </li>
            <li>Instead of distilling the herbs and drinking the tea, or swallowing the herbs in capsules, the herbs&#x27; most important (essential) oils are extracted and bottled.</li>
            <li>so this seems a bit expensive, but it is a very nice mister.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sample provided for an honest review.  </li>
            <li>did work right out of the box.</li>
            <li>We promised that if we did review this item, it would be our unbiased opinion with the intent of helping Amazon customers make the right buying decision for them and to increase awareness of the item that will help reduce returns.  </li>
            <li>The Namaste diffuser I received a sample of for review purposes works beautifully for diffusing the aroma of essential oils into the air while providing subtle mood lighting and a gentle sound that many users will find relaxing.</li>
            <li>This is a fascinating subject, very much tied into herbology.</li>
            <li>etc., where a diffuser of this type is running without first shutting it</li>
            <li>(there must not be many English speakers in Shenzen...</li>
            <li>To use, just remove the cover (top), add water and a couple drops of your desired oil, put the cover back on and turn the diffuser on.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m stuck with a diffuser that blinks regardless how much water is placed in it!</li>
            <li>For headaches, the traditional favorite of the Queen of Hungry was Eau de Cologne, which was 2 drops lavender oil, 2 drops orange oil (or</li>
            <li>You can also choose to have the light loop through all the colors or turn them completely</li>
            <li>I definitely enjoyed the SAVASANA ULTRASONIC AROMA DIFFUSER, however, because of the larger water reservoir.  </li>
            <li>However, there are those who won&#x27;t want a diffuser to be on for more than an hour and who prefer bigger lights.</li>
            <li>They could have gone with a larger water reservoir to hold more.</li>
            <li>On this one it sits on top of the water reservoir, which takes up room that could have been used for a larger reservoir.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Having the diffusing cap sit on top of the reservoir makes it a bit trickier to attach the cap after filling, but after fiddling with it a couple of times it&#x27;s not a big deal.</li>
            <li>It operates similar to most diffusers in that you can run the lights and mist together or separately.</li>
            <li>The NAMASTE ULTRASONIC AROMA DIFFUSER is plastic, but it has a nice imitation wood grain look on the bottom that sets it apart.</li>
            <li>It should blink a couple times then shut completely off and not continue to blink red until you unplug it.&lt;br /&gt;Sample received in exchange for an honest review.</li>
            <li>The led are also nicely and clearly labeled and something I wish all diffusers would do by properly labeling the buttons and indicator lights.</li>
            <li>diffuser is a nice looking one with properly and clearly labeled buttons and lights.</li>
            <li>included instruction sheet says nothing about an auto-off function, but in my experience, when the water gets so low that a tiny straw-type outlet is exposed, a light begins to flash, presumably to let users know that it&#x27;s time to shut the unit off to add more water.</li>
            <li>Start up is pretty much instant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>A personal favorite is a diffuser filled with Patchouli oil from mystical India, perhaps mixed into Sandalwood oil.</li>
            <li>This product worked very well at first, produced a nice aromatic vapor and was simple enough to use.</li>
            <li>this quits diffusing and flashes the red light.</li>
            <li>The jet of mist that this diffuser produces can be programmed to be very forceful--more of a jet of mist than I&#x27;ve witnessed before.  </li>
            <li>This diffuser can really get your fragrance out into the room.  </li>
            <li>Then, it flashes into light blue.</li>
            <li>The Savasana held a whole pint of oil.</li>
            <li>/&gt;You can select and lock in a specific color for the light to remain.</li>
            <li>If you like a specific color click the light button when it gets to the color of your choice and your color will stay lit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>course, you don&#x27;t need to practice Yoga, or listen to Sitar music, in order to appreciate the beauty of this well designed diffuser, with its relaxing light show, and cool mist diffusing various essential oils.</li>
            <li>Namaste diffuser also give you options for whether the mist is on or off (i.e., you could use the unit for light only if desired), and whether the mist is high, medium, or low.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I also like the big easy to use rubberized buttons for controlling the lighting, and the fact that for once an instruction manual is clear and well-written</li>
            <li>Mist button cycles through on, full mist, medium, low and off.</li>
            <li>With essential oils and a diffuser, the healing properties of the seeds, leaves, bark, flowers or fruits are drawn into the cool mist, then diffused into the air.  </li>
            <li>(Its true, even the wealthiest people in the middle ages seldom bathed.</li>
            <li>/&gt;There are only two buttons, the one on the left is for the light control and the one on the right is for the mist control.  </li>
            <li>The light produced is subtle and gentle, and when in the mode where it changes color, the change is gradual and smooth.</li>
            <li>The water tank holds 120ml, about half a cup, but I added a bit more water, and didn&#x27;t notice any problems with the mist quality or quantity.</li>
            <li>particular diffuser, the Namaste, has a wood-grain-looking finish on the base/control panel.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, the NAMASTE ULTRASONIC AROMA DIFFUSER is a decent diffuser.</li>
            <li>The entire top cover lights up and will change from one color to the next</li>
            <li>The transducer creates high frequency oscillation on the water surface, which turns the water into vapor.</li>
            <li>When you plug it in it starts with high mist and rotating colors.</li>
            <li>There are three led indicators for power, mist mode level, and stop warning light for when it is empty.</li>
            <li>The included adapter has a cord that is a generous 6&#x27; long, and it ends in a wall wart that, were you to plug it into the top outlet of a standard two-outlet wall outlet, would cover the bottom outlet.</li>
            <li>I have a few ultrasonic aroma diffusers already, this has a more vertical design .  </li>
            <li>Its exit hole is angled, too, and that also helps expel the mist into the air.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Being a cool mist--mist not produced by hot steam--my essential oils last longer in the water bath.  </li>
            <li>I have somewhere between 30 to 40 various essential oils, and often mix them into my own, personal creations to compliment or change my mood.</li>
            <li>I have somewhere between 30 to 40 various essential oils, and often mix them into my own, personal creations to compliment or change my mood.</li>
            <li>Those three, very bright blue LEDs; two big oval white buttons, and the descriptions in black ink that go along with them.  </li>
            <li>To put back together, make sure you pay attention to the small notch on the clear plastic inside top and the notches on the outer white plastic body.</li>
            <li>Never put &amp;#34;perfume oils&amp;#34;, or other cheap fragrance liquids inside the tank.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m extremely new to this scene,</li>
            <li>There are thus two gentle, subtle sounds in play when the diffuser is operating: the gentle whir of the fan, and the sound of water dripping inside the unit.</li>
            <li>The light cycles through blue, light green, green, light blue, purple,etc.</li>
            <li>The lights change from light blue to light green to green to light blue to purple to red to light blue to blue and then repeats.</li>
            <li>To fill you turn the white body slightly and pull off, inside is a clear plastic top that you also pull off, add the water and oil.</li>
            <li>For mist control, you can choose high, medium, or low (default is high) as well as turning the unit off.</li>
            <li>so well I order a second one and that one works really well too.</li>
            <li>The well into which water goes is clearly marked to show you the maximum fill level.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;It died young (like 3 months after I got it.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>One button activates the mist function, with two choices for mist intensity, light or heavy.</li>
            <li>Instead, imagine the soft, relaxing fragrance of the herb fields of France, covered with Lavender.</li>
            <li>Some oils have the properties of incense, creating a soft mood in a room, and masking any animal smell, or lack of bathing.</li>
            <li>This WAS a very pretty diffuser that provided three levels of misting and can last a really long time on the lowest setting.</li>
            <li>In fog-makers there are no fans, so the vapor lays low like a fog, while in diffusers a fan pushes the vapor through and out of an enclosed area, with the result that a steady stream of vapor flows out of the diffuser.</li>
            <li>If we do review a gifted item and the giver of the gift prefers our review to be private between them and us and not posted on Amazon publicly, we usually honor that giver&#x27;s request.  </li>
            <li>The mist button has three modes (low, medium and high) and off.</li>
            <li>You can choose high, medium, or low.</li>
            <li>Mist settings are low, medium, high and off.</li>
            <li>Though I&#x27;m not sure, I doubt it would be good for the piezoelectric transducer to get completely dry when the unit is turned on in a misting mode, so I would avoid letting it get dry.</li>
            <li>and you will of course need space around it, because you would not want mist aiming directly at a wall or in the direction of anything that could be potentially damaged by mist (books, electronic equipment, etc.).</li>
            <li>Even though its faux wood, you really have to look twice, before you believe its not real.</li>
            <li>With a full tank, this usually runs for about 4 hours depending on mist level.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I notice that it really doesn&#x27;t last long before it starts to blink red even if I fill up the tank to the maximum level.  </li>
            <li>That mode, where the light subtly and gradually changes in a loop, is my favorite.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I initially had trouble removing the top, it seems to be too tight</li>
            <li>/&gt;Diffuser look pretty nice with the base designed in wood pattern.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s usually recommended to add one or two drops of oils, I never really count, I just shake the bottle like a salt shaker until it looks and smells about right!</li>

            <li> I have a whole collection of diffusers, and this is a nice one compared to the rest.  </li>
            <li> Feel free to ask a question in the comments section</li>
            <li> The light button automatically loops colors, but you can hit it again to &#x27;lock in&#x27; a preferred color, or again to turn the lights</li>
            <li> Unlike others, I don’t mind the indicator warning light although there should be an option to turn off that light if you choose.</li>
            <li> I love these changing, colorful LED fixtures:  </li>
            <li> But there is something about this light and diffuser that is distracting....</li>
            <li> Why not put this distracting stuff on the backside of the light, alongside the port for the adapter?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> When it runs out of water, the STOP light flashes.</li>
            <li> Colored light turns itself on (flashes) and diffuser turns itself off.</li>
            <li> This works great with fragrance oils and essential oils.</li>
            <li> When diffuser is out of water, the &amp;#34;stop&amp;#34; light flashes.</li>
            <li> /&gt;We received this item as a gift (free or at a discount) with no promise of posting a review.  </li>
            <li> Every diffuser I&#x27;ve ever seen or reviewed, has something about it that makes it unique.</li>
            <li> It is recommended to clean the tank weekly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;There are two buttons both nicely and clearly labeled mist and light.</li>
            <li> For example, it would be great during a yoga practice or meditation session, where you would be running it for a limited time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product provided by the seller for evaluation purposes.</li>
            <li> You can rotate through the colors or fix on one special color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So if you are looking for a more intense experience, this may be the diffuser you want.</li>
            <li> A full tank will provide about three to six hours of mist.</li>

            <li> Women love Ylang-Ylang oil, which smells very close to Jasmine.</li>
            <li> This is a very pretty diffuser, the light colored imitation wood grain on the bottom looks very nice.</li>
            <li> (Right below the MIST and LIGHT indicator lights, between the buttons.)  </li>
            <li> You can use it with the light off, you can run it with a steady light, or you can run it with the light changing in a loop.</li>
            <li> The instruction manual was clearly written and actually useful, which is nice for a change.</li>
            <li> but if you are going to use the light, this diffuser has a huge lighted area -- basically the whole plastic part showing in the product images.</li>

            <li> This aromatherapy vessel is sharp looking and has a very nice contoured shape as I look at it from all angles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So much information can be found on line on aromatherapy, however, drop me a line in the  comments if you need a bit of info, and I&#x27;ll do my best to help you.&lt;br /&gt;I was provided a free diffuser in exchange for my fair and honest review.rose, (yin, very spiritual), or Patchouli oil (yang in quality, you will either love or hate the smell.</li>

            <li> Instead of distilling the herbs and drinking the tea, or swallowing the herbs in capsules, the herbs&#x27; most important (essential) oils are extracted and bottled.</li>
            <li> so this seems a bit expensive, but it is a very nice mister.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sample provided for an honest review.  </li>
            <li> did work right out of the box.</li>
            <li> We promised that if we did review this item, it would be our unbiased opinion with the intent of helping Amazon customers make the right buying decision for them and to increase awareness of the item that will help reduce returns.  </li>
            <li> The Namaste diffuser I received a sample of for review purposes works beautifully for diffusing the aroma of essential oils into the air while providing subtle mood lighting and a gentle sound that many users will find relaxing.</li>
            <li> This is a fascinating subject, very much tied into herbology.</li>
            <li> etc., where a diffuser of this type is running without first shutting it</li>
            <li> (there must not be many English speakers in Shenzen...</li>
            <li> To use, just remove the cover (top), add water and a couple drops of your desired oil, put the cover back on and turn the diffuser on.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m stuck with a diffuser that blinks regardless how much water is placed in it!</li>
            <li> For headaches, the traditional favorite of the Queen of Hungry was Eau de Cologne, which was 2 drops lavender oil, 2 drops orange oil (or</li>
            <li> You can also choose to have the light loop through all the colors or turn them completely</li>
            <li> I definitely enjoyed the SAVASANA ULTRASONIC AROMA DIFFUSER, however, because of the larger water reservoir.  </li>
            <li> However, there are those who won&#x27;t want a diffuser to be on for more than an hour and who prefer bigger lights.</li>
            <li> They could have gone with a larger water reservoir to hold more.</li>
            <li> On this one it sits on top of the water reservoir, which takes up room that could have been used for a larger reservoir.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Having the diffusing cap sit on top of the reservoir makes it a bit trickier to attach the cap after filling, but after fiddling with it a couple of times it&#x27;s not a big deal.</li>
            <li> It operates similar to most diffusers in that you can run the lights and mist together or separately.</li>
            <li> The NAMASTE ULTRASONIC AROMA DIFFUSER is plastic, but it has a nice imitation wood grain look on the bottom that sets it apart.</li>
            <li> It should blink a couple times then shut completely off and not continue to blink red until you unplug it.&lt;br /&gt;Sample received in exchange for an honest review.</li>
            <li> The led are also nicely and clearly labeled and something I wish all diffusers would do by properly labeling the buttons and indicator lights.</li>
            <li> diffuser is a nice looking one with properly and clearly labeled buttons and lights.</li>
            <li> included instruction sheet says nothing about an auto-off function, but in my experience, when the water gets so low that a tiny straw-type outlet is exposed, a light begins to flash, presumably to let users know that it&#x27;s time to shut the unit off to add more water.</li>
            <li> Start up is pretty much instant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A personal favorite is a diffuser filled with Patchouli oil from mystical India, perhaps mixed into Sandalwood oil.</li>
            <li> This product worked very well at first, produced a nice aromatic vapor and was simple enough to use.</li>
            <li> this quits diffusing and flashes the red light.</li>
            <li> The jet of mist that this diffuser produces can be programmed to be very forceful--more of a jet of mist than I&#x27;ve witnessed before.  </li>
            <li> This diffuser can really get your fragrance out into the room.  </li>
            <li> Then, it flashes into light blue.</li>
            <li> The Savasana held a whole pint of oil.</li>
            <li> /&gt;You can select and lock in a specific color for the light to remain.</li>
            <li> If you like a specific color click the light button when it gets to the color of your choice and your color will stay lit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> course, you don&#x27;t need to practice Yoga, or listen to Sitar music, in order to appreciate the beauty of this well designed diffuser, with its relaxing light show, and cool mist diffusing various essential oils.</li>
            <li> Namaste diffuser also give you options for whether the mist is on or off (i.e., you could use the unit for light only if desired), and whether the mist is high, medium, or low.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I also like the big easy to use rubberized buttons for controlling the lighting, and the fact that for once an instruction manual is clear and well-written</li>
            <li> Mist button cycles through on, full mist, medium, low and off.</li>
            <li> With essential oils and a diffuser, the healing properties of the seeds, leaves, bark, flowers or fruits are drawn into the cool mist, then diffused into the air.  </li>
            <li> (Its true, even the wealthiest people in the middle ages seldom bathed.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There are only two buttons, the one on the left is for the light control and the one on the right is for the mist control.  </li>
            <li> The light produced is subtle and gentle, and when in the mode where it changes color, the change is gradual and smooth.</li>
            <li> The water tank holds 120ml, about half a cup, but I added a bit more water, and didn&#x27;t notice any problems with the mist quality or quantity.</li>
            <li> particular diffuser, the Namaste, has a wood-grain-looking finish on the base/control panel.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, the NAMASTE ULTRASONIC AROMA DIFFUSER is a decent diffuser.</li>
            <li> The entire top cover lights up and will change from one color to the next</li>
            <li> The transducer creates high frequency oscillation on the water surface, which turns the water into vapor.</li>
            <li> When you plug it in it starts with high mist and rotating colors.</li>
            <li> There are three led indicators for power, mist mode level, and stop warning light for when it is empty.</li>
            <li> The included adapter has a cord that is a generous 6&#x27; long, and it ends in a wall wart that, were you to plug it into the top outlet of a standard two-outlet wall outlet, would cover the bottom outlet.</li>
            <li> I have a few ultrasonic aroma diffusers already, this has a more vertical design .  </li>
            <li> Its exit hole is angled, too, and that also helps expel the mist into the air.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Being a cool mist--mist not produced by hot steam--my essential oils last longer in the water bath.  </li>
            <li> I have somewhere between 30 to 40 various essential oils, and often mix them into my own, personal creations to compliment or change my mood.</li>
            <li> I have somewhere between 30 to 40 various essential oils, and often mix them into my own, personal creations to compliment or change my mood.</li>
            <li> Those three, very bright blue LEDs; two big oval white buttons, and the descriptions in black ink that go along with them.  </li>
            <li> To put back together, make sure you pay attention to the small notch on the clear plastic inside top and the notches on the outer white plastic body.</li>
            <li> Never put &amp;#34;perfume oils&amp;#34;, or other cheap fragrance liquids inside the tank.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m extremely new to this scene,</li>
            <li> There are thus two gentle, subtle sounds in play when the diffuser is operating: the gentle whir of the fan, and the sound of water dripping inside the unit.</li>
            <li> The light cycles through blue, light green, green, light blue, purple,etc.</li>
            <li> The lights change from light blue to light green to green to light blue to purple to red to light blue to blue and then repeats.</li>
            <li> To fill you turn the white body slightly and pull off, inside is a clear plastic top that you also pull off, add the water and oil.</li>
            <li> For mist control, you can choose high, medium, or low (default is high) as well as turning the unit off.</li>
            <li> so well I order a second one and that one works really well too.</li>
            <li> The well into which water goes is clearly marked to show you the maximum fill level.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;It died young (like 3 months after I got it.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> One button activates the mist function, with two choices for mist intensity, light or heavy.</li>
            <li> Instead, imagine the soft, relaxing fragrance of the herb fields of France, covered with Lavender.</li>
            <li> Some oils have the properties of incense, creating a soft mood in a room, and masking any animal smell, or lack of bathing.</li>
            <li> This WAS a very pretty diffuser that provided three levels of misting and can last a really long time on the lowest setting.</li>
            <li> In fog-makers there are no fans, so the vapor lays low like a fog, while in diffusers a fan pushes the vapor through and out of an enclosed area, with the result that a steady stream of vapor flows out of the diffuser.</li>
            <li> If we do review a gifted item and the giver of the gift prefers our review to be private between them and us and not posted on Amazon publicly, we usually honor that giver&#x27;s request.  </li>
            <li> The mist button has three modes (low, medium and high) and off.</li>
            <li> You can choose high, medium, or low.</li>
            <li> Mist settings are low, medium, high and off.</li>
            <li> Though I&#x27;m not sure, I doubt it would be good for the piezoelectric transducer to get completely dry when the unit is turned on in a misting mode, so I would avoid letting it get dry.</li>
            <li> and you will of course need space around it, because you would not want mist aiming directly at a wall or in the direction of anything that could be potentially damaged by mist (books, electronic equipment, etc.).</li>
            <li> Even though its faux wood, you really have to look twice, before you believe its not real.</li>
            <li> With a full tank, this usually runs for about 4 hours depending on mist level.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I notice that it really doesn&#x27;t last long before it starts to blink red even if I fill up the tank to the maximum level.  </li>
            <li> That mode, where the light subtly and gradually changes in a loop, is my favorite.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I initially had trouble removing the top, it seems to be too tight</li>
            <li> /&gt;Diffuser look pretty nice with the base designed in wood pattern.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s usually recommended to add one or two drops of oils, I never really count, I just shake the bottle like a salt shaker until it looks and smells about right!</li>
            <li> The Namaste has feet that raise the bottom up just enough to allow for proper venting when the unit is on a flat surface.</li>
            <li> base has a faux wood look which I think looks very nice.</li>
            <li> The only other experience I have had with a diffuser was the SAVASANA ULTRASONIC AROMA DIFFUSER from this same manufacturer.  </li>
            <li> The colors are light blue, dark blue, green, dark green, purple, and red/pink.</li>
            <li> It is not as quiet as I expected it to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Deodorants have been around for a long time.)</li>
            <li> The other button controls the mood lighting, that illuminates the white sleeve that covers the water tank.</li>
            <li> You can run it with one of seven different colored lights, rotate through the colors or have no light at all except for the 3 tiny led power lights.  </li>
            <li> but I prefer another model from this vendor as there aren&#x27;t indicator lights so it can be completely dark as well as silent.</li>
            <li> You turn it on, and you get dark blue.</li>
            <li> Really very disappointed because I was enjoying it so much!</li>
            <li> Ultimately, it all comes down to your style and price-point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> diffuser to me almost looks like a giant white candle with its white plastic body and light wood grain base (also made of plastic).</li>
            <li> The NAMASTE ULTRASONIC AROMA DIFFUSER only holds about half a cup.</li>
            <li> Normally the colors slowly morph into each other.</li>
            <li> Although there is no minimum line, there&#x27;s a little metal bit sticking up from the bottom and if the water level gets below that, the diffuser will turn itself off (even though there&#x27;s maybe 1/2 inch of water left in the tank).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> When the water is scented with a few drops of essential oil, the vapor is scented, and the scented vapor creates an aroma in the area where the diffuser is used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Then its suddenly green, then indigo, then red.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s kind of annoying.</li>
            <li> You also probably already know that a little oil goes a long way.</li>
            <li> It has some advantages and some disadvantages when compared to other diffusers.</li>
            <li> (On the other hand, if you are looking for a longer operating time, look elsewhere.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Putting a diffuser on a carpet or any other non-flat surface could result in the vents getting blocked.</li>
            <li> The reservoir capacity is a bit small and the diffuser could be a bit easier to put back together.</li>
            <li> This diffuser has a mood lighting, that differs from all other diffusers.</li>
            <li> The great thing about a diffuser, is that you can stop spraying artificial air fresheners, or scented candles, and other artificial odors into your home.</li>
            <li> The plastic cover is a little difficult to remove the first time</li>
            <li> Add a few drops of your essential oil into the water, no more than 5 or 6 drops are needed.</li>

            <li> Then, a slight bow is performed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have quite the collection of aromatherapy diffusers these days. This is the latest I tried. It has some advantages and some disadvantages when compared to other diffusers. Hopefully my comments here will help you make a decision!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, this has a fairly low capacity. It comes with a plastic cup and you can use about one fill of the cup to fill the reservoir (there&#x27;s a max fill line, which is helpful). Although there is no minimum line, there&#x27;s a little metal bit sticking up from the bottom and if the water level gets below that, the diffuser will turn itself off (even though there&#x27;s maybe 1/2 inch of water left in the tank).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because of this arrangement, you won&#x27;t get a lengthy continuous mist. At maximum mist intensity, you&#x27;ll get under two hours (probably closer to 90 minutes) of time. You can decrease the mist intensity and get a bit more. This diffuser puts out a lot of mist. So if you are looking for a more intense experience, this may be the diffuser you want. (On the other hand, if you are looking for a longer operating time, look elsewhere.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This did work right out of the box. It was a bit difficult to open and close the cover, but not unreasonably so. The instruction manual was clearly written and actually useful, which is nice for a change. It does a good job of distributing fragrance as well as mist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can run this without the light but if you are going to use the light, this diffuser has a huge lighted area -- basically the whole plastic part showing in the product images. You have a variety of color options to choose from. There are LED indicators on the front so this may not be the best choice for a dark bedroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All-in-all, I think this will definitely fill a niche. For example, it would be great during a yoga practice or meditation session, where you would be running it for a limited time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product provided by the seller for evaluation purposes.</li>
            <li> This works so well I order a second one and that one works really well too.</li>
            <li> The Namaste diffuser I received a sample of for review purposes works beautifully for diffusing the aroma of essential oils into the air while providing subtle mood lighting and a gentle sound that many users will find relaxing. (&amp;#34;Namaste,&amp;#34; as you probably know, is Hindu for &amp;#34;I bow to the divine within you.&amp;#34;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An ultrasonic diffuser produces a cool mist that is driven out of the unit by means of a tiny fan in the base of the unit. There are thus two gentle, subtle sounds in play when the diffuser is operating: the gentle whir of the fan, and the sound of water dripping inside the unit. Ultrasonic diffusers use a similar same type of ultrasonic element that is found in mist-makers/foggers. That element is called a piezoelectric transducer. The transducer creates high frequency oscillation on the water surface, which turns the water into vapor. In fog-makers there are no fans, so the vapor lays low like a fog, while in diffusers a fan pushes the vapor through and out of an enclosed area, with the result that a steady stream of vapor flows out of the diffuser. When the water is scented with a few drops of essential oil, the vapor is scented, and the scented vapor creates an aroma in the area where the diffuser is used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because this diffuser (like diffusers in general) has a fan in its base, it has vents on the bottom to prevent the fan from overheating, which means that the Namaste should be on a hard, flat surface when operating. Putting a diffuser on a carpet or any other non-flat surface could result in the vents getting blocked. The Namaste has feet that raise the bottom up just enough to allow for proper venting when the unit is on a flat surface. When I use it on the floor next to a bed in my carpeted bedrooms, I set it on a dish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This diffuser gives you options for how it lights. You can use it with the light off, you can run it with a steady light, or you can run it with the light changing in a loop. The light produced is subtle and gentle, and when in the mode where it changes color, the change is gradual and smooth. That mode, where the light subtly and gradually changes in a loop, is my favorite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Namaste diffuser also give you options for whether the mist is on or off (i.e., you could use the unit for light only if desired), and whether the mist is high, medium, or low.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Filling the Namaste with water requires that you remove the white translucent outer sleeve or cover, then another cover or cap inside the unit. The well into which water goes is clearly marked to show you the maximum fill level.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The included instruction sheet says nothing about an auto-off function, but in my experience, when the water gets so low that a tiny straw-type outlet is exposed, a light begins to flash, presumably to let users know that it&#x27;s time to shut the unit off to add more water. Though I&#x27;m not sure, I doubt it would be good for the piezoelectric transducer to get completely dry when the unit is turned on in a misting mode, so I would avoid letting it get dry. I would never intentionally leave the house or office, etc., where a diffuser of this type is running without first shutting it off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The base has a faux wood look which I think looks very nice. The footprint of this unit is about 4&amp;#34; x 5 1/4&amp;#34;  (the extra 1 1/4&amp;#34; on one side is because the adapter cable coming out the back takes up space) and you will of course need space around it, because you would not want mist aiming directly at a wall or in the direction of anything that could be potentially damaged by mist (books, electronic equipment, etc.). The included adapter has a cord that is a generous 6&#x27; long, and it ends in a wall wart that, were you to plug it into the top outlet of a standard two-outlet wall outlet, would cover the bottom outlet. (Ideally you&#x27;d plug it into the bottom outlet in order to keep the top outlet free, but I&#x27;m just trying to give you a sense of what kind of wall wart the Namaste comes with.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Namaste comes well-protected in a very attractive, classy looking box that would make for an impressive gift presentation.cted in a very attractive, classy looking box that would make for an impressive gift presentation.</li>
            <li> This product worked very well at first, produced a nice aromatic vapor and was simple enough to use. Now however, it has become defunct. I fill the water just below the max fill line, add my oils and plug in. It will produce vapor for about 2-3 minutes max, and then the vapor stops and lights flicker the same way as when it runs out of water to work with. I have tried rinsing out the receptacle and wiping it out to remove any buildup, but still no improvement. Really very disappointed because I was enjoying it so much! *I would like to note that I ordered this from groupon, and have had it for about 3-4 weeks*</li>
            <li> I have a few ultrasonic aroma diffusers already, this has a more vertical design .  I initially had trouble removing the top, it seems to be too tight but I found out that you need to twist it a little bit before lifting it off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quickspecs: This diffuser can run on 100 to 240V.  It consumes 9 W of power. A full tank will provide about three to six hours of mist. It is recommended to clean the tank weekly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are only two buttons, the one on the left is for the light control and the one on the right is for the mist control.  The light cycles through blue, light green, green, light blue, purple,etc., if you press the button again it will stop on the one color at the time you press it.  Mist button cycles through on, full mist, medium, low and off. If the diffuser run out of water or has too little water, the LED will start blinking red.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Diffuser look pretty nice with the base designed in wood pattern.  I notice that it really doesn&#x27;t last long before it starts to blink red even if I fill up the tank to the maximum level.  It is not as quiet as I expected it to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a sample I then sent to me for review and a valuation.</li>
            <li> This is a fairly easy to use diffuser. The plastic cover is a little difficult to remove the first time but once you figure it our it is easy on successive attempts. You can run it with one of seven different colored lights, rotate through the colors or have no light at all except for the 3 tiny led power lights.  When you plug it in it starts with high mist and rotating colors. You can change these setting with the buttons on the front of it.&lt;br /&gt;When the water level falls below the sensor that sits in the bottom of the tank this quits diffusing and flashes the red light. Great idea but it&#x27;s kind of annoying. It should blink a couple times then shut completely off and not continue to blink red until you unplug it.&lt;br /&gt;Sample received in exchange for an honest review.</li>
            <li> I have a whole collection of diffusers, and this is a nice one compared to the rest.  It looks premium (wood finish) and puts out a very strong mist, and I like the fact that the measuring cup is built in.  I also like the big easy to use rubberized buttons for controlling the lighting, and the fact that for once an instruction manual is clear and well-written (there must not be many English speakers in Shenzen...)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most misters I&#x27;m reviewing are around $20 so this seems a bit expensive, but it is a very nice mister.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sample provided for an honest review.  I write these reviews for you, the readers, not the sellers.  Feel free to ask a question in the comments section and I&#x27;ll do my best to answer within 48 hours.  Hope this helps.</li>
            <li> I am not going to get into the legitimacy of essential oils. If you are looking at a diffuser for said essential oils, then I figure you are in the market for a reason. You also probably already know that a little oil goes a long way. There are a variety of diffusers out there that come in different shapes and sizes; some with glowing colors and others without. Ultimately, it all comes down to your style and price-point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m extremely new to this scene, but I prefer another model from this vendor as there aren&#x27;t indicator lights so it can be completely dark as well as silent. That is the ONLY reason I knocked off a star. If you don&#x27;t have my hang-ups for light-less sleeping, then this should work well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This particular diffuser, the Namaste, has a wood-grain-looking finish on the base/control panel. To use, just remove the cover (top), add water and a couple drops of your desired oil, put the cover back on and turn the diffuser on. Start up is pretty much instant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This unit has indicator lights and two separate buttons. For mist control, you can choose high, medium, or low (default is high) as well as turning the unit off. The light button automatically loops colors, but you can hit it again to &#x27;lock in&#x27; a preferred color, or again to turn the lights off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, this doesn&#x27;t use heat. So it is safe for work unless people complain about your favorite scent. The company sent a promotional sample for evaluation without promise of a review.</li>
            <li> Included with the diffuser are the power cable (approximately 5 feet 10 inches in length), a measuring cup and the instruction manual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This diffuser to me almost looks like a giant white candle with its white plastic body and light wood grain base (also made of plastic). To fill you turn the white body slightly and pull off, inside is a clear plastic top that you also pull off, add the water and oil. The water/oil reservoir is fairly small in comparison to other diffusers. To put back together, make sure you pay attention to the small notch on the clear plastic inside top and the notches on the outer white plastic body. This could be a little easier to put together than it is though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are two buttons both nicely and clearly labeled mist and light. The mist button has three modes (low, medium and high) and off. The light button can be changed to rotate all colors or a certain color or off. There are three led indicators for power, mist mode level, and stop warning light for when it is empty. Unlike others, I don’t mind the indicator warning light although there should be an option to turn off that light if you choose. The led are also nicely and clearly labeled and something I wish all diffusers would do by properly labeling the buttons and indicator lights. The diffuser operates quietly (maybe hear the water bubbling once In a while) and quickly sends out the vapor. With a full tank, this usually runs for about 4 hours depending on mist level.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This diffuser is a nice looking one with properly and clearly labeled buttons and lights. The reservoir capacity is a bit small and the diffuser could be a bit easier to put back together. If this had a larger capacity this would be 5 stars for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4 stars&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was provided a sample for review and I do not promise a good rating in return, nor am I affiliated with this company or compensated in any way. I am just a regular Amazon customer who shops a lot on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Do not buy! Product worked like three times then stopped! Seller won&#x27;t let me return it after 30 days so I&#x27;m stuck with a diffuser that blinks regardless how much water is placed in it!</li>
            <li> This WAS a very pretty diffuser that provided three levels of misting and can last a really long time on the lowest setting. It does an excellent job of dispersing essential oils for aromatherapy, and it shuts itself off when it runs out of water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It died young (like 3 months after I got it.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*review sample provided</li>
            <li> The jet of mist that this diffuser produces can be programmed to be very forceful--more of a jet of mist than I&#x27;ve witnessed before.  If that is what you are looking for, this might just be perfect for your needs.  This diffuser can really get your fragrance out into the room.  Its exit hole is angled, too, and that also helps expel the mist into the air.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Being a cool mist--mist not produced by hot steam--my essential oils last longer in the water bath.  That is a very good thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This flattering design with a sleek tower and nice-looking beech wood-look base, had the potential to be a real winner.  I love these changing, colorful LED fixtures:  Mesmerizing and soothing--usually.  But there is something about this light and diffuser that is distracting....Those three, very bright blue LEDs; two big oval white buttons, and the descriptions in black ink that go along with them.  So sad!  Why not put this distracting stuff on the backside of the light, alongside the port for the adapter?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you intend to position this somewhere in the background, then maybe the offending LEDs won&#x27;t seem so prominent.  This aromatherapy vessel is sharp looking and has a very nice contoured shape as I look at it from all angles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has great features:  Three mist volumes and pleasant choices in the colored lights.  You can rotate through the colors or fix on one special color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I received a sample product from TNG.</li>
            <li> NAMASTE -- (Hindi)  Traditional Indian greeting, with both palms together, thumbs over the heart.  Then, a slight bow is performed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, you don&#x27;t need to practice Yoga, or listen to Sitar music, in order to appreciate the beauty of this well designed diffuser, with its relaxing light show, and cool mist diffusing various essential oils. I think the design of this diffuser is well done. Even though its faux wood, you really have to look twice, before you believe its not real. In the base of the diffuser are the function buttons. One button activates the mist function, with two choices for mist intensity, light or heavy. The other button controls the mood lighting, that illuminates the white sleeve that covers the water tank. Every diffuser I&#x27;ve ever seen or reviewed, has something about it that makes it unique. This diffuser has a mood lighting, that differs from all other diffusers. Normally the colors slowly morph into each other. So the Blue turns turquois, then to forest green, then a light spring green, into yellow, orange, etc. Not this diffuser. You turn it on, and you get dark blue. Then, it flashes into light blue. Then its suddenly green, then indigo, then red. Of course, you can just pick a color, and let the diffuser remain lit on that color. The water tank holds 120ml, about half a cup, but I added a bit more water, and didn&#x27;t notice any problems with the mist quality or quantity. Add a few drops of your essential oil into the water, no more than 5 or 6 drops are needed. Then, relax. When it runs out of water, the STOP light flashes. (Right below the MIST and LIGHT indicator lights, between the buttons.)  Never put &amp;#34;perfume oils&amp;#34;, or other cheap fragrance liquids inside the tank. Don&#x27;t even use essential oils, that have been diluted with Jojoba oil either. Those oils will create a gunk around the diffuser&#x27;s ceramic disc, that produces the ultrasonic vibration. The great thing about a diffuser, is that you can stop spraying artificial air fresheners, or scented candles, and other artificial odors into your home. Those chemicals go into the air you breathe.  Then, they go in the body.  Personally, I&#x27;m allergic to artificial fragrances.  They smell like chemicals, harsh, and often sharp.  Instead, imagine the soft, relaxing fragrance of the herb fields of France, covered with Lavender. Or the orange groves of Arabia. Perhaps the myrrh trees in Somalia, or cinnamon oil from Madagascar. A personal favorite is a diffuser filled with Patchouli oil from mystical India, perhaps mixed into Sandalwood oil. If I&#x27;m suffering from a lung ailment, with a cough, I use some peppermint and a touch of Eucalyptus.  For headaches, the traditional favorite of the Queen of Hungry was Eau de Cologne, which was 2 drops lavender oil, 2 drops orange oil (or bergamot oil is better), and 3 drops of Rosemary oil. Aromatherapy is fine art for the nose. As you practice this art, you&#x27;ll develop a more keen sense of smell.  Plus, if you want to study the lore and history behind various smells, you could by a book on aromatherapy, or the history of perfumery. This is a fascinating subject, very much tied into herbology. Instead of distilling the herbs and drinking the tea, or swallowing the herbs in capsules, the herbs&#x27; most important (essential) oils are extracted and bottled. With essential oils and a diffuser, the healing properties of the seeds, leaves, bark, flowers or fruits are drawn into the cool mist, then diffused into the air.  As the lung and sinuses inhale the aroma, the healing properties of the essential oils start to work. Some oils will stimulate the body, like Peppermint, some relax, like lavender. Some oils have the properties of incense, creating a soft mood in a room, and masking any animal smell, or lack of bathing. (Its true, even the wealthiest people in the middle ages seldom bathed. Instead, they poured perfume on themselves. Deodorants have been around for a long time.) Good deodorant smells include oil of rose, (yin, very spiritual), or Patchouli oil (yang in quality, you will either love or hate the smell. I love it) even Frankincense or Myrrh. Why not put essential oil of Pine into a diffuser during Christmas, especially if you have an artificial tree? You could buy essential oil of citronella, and use your diffuser outside, during a picnic. I have somewhere between 30 to 40 various essential oils, and often mix them into my own, personal creations to compliment or change my mood. Or cover over my cat&#x27;s smell. However, you dont need to start out with all that. Perhaps buy an essential Oil kit, with 6 different scents, or even just buy two or three essential oils when you purchase this diffuser. I would recommend peppermint (in case you&#x27;re sick, or want a stimulating smell), then buy Orange oil, Lavender oil, then an essential oil that speaks to you personally, like Cedarwood oil, or Patchouli. Women love Ylang-Ylang oil, which smells very close to Jasmine. Whatever you decide, you know that you are going to help your lungs recover from years of artificial smells from candles, air fresheners and fragrance oils. So much information can be found on line on aromatherapy, however, drop me a line in the  comments if you need a bit of info, and I&#x27;ll do my best to help you.&lt;br /&gt;I was provided a free diffuser in exchange for my fair and honest review.rose, (yin, very spiritual), or Patchouli oil (yang in quality, you will either love or hate the smell.

            <li> The only other experience I have had with a diffuser was the SAVASANA ULTRASONIC AROMA DIFFUSER from this same manufacturer.  The NAMASTE ULTRASONIC AROMA DIFFUSER is plastic, but it has a nice imitation wood grain look on the bottom that sets it apart. To use you just remove the cover, add water, add a few drops of your desired oil, and then turn the diffuser on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was a little disappointed in the size of the water basin on this device. The Savasana held a whole pint of oil. The NAMASTE ULTRASONIC AROMA DIFFUSER only holds about half a cup. Therefore, it only works for about an hour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are three different mist modes. You can choose high, medium, or low. You get a good amount of mist on the highest setting, but instead of an hour, the water will be used up in about 50 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can select and lock in a specific color for the light to remain. The colors are light blue, dark blue, green, dark green, purple, and red/pink. You can also choose to have the light loop through all the colors or turn them completely off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The device uses no heat so is safe at the office or at home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, the NAMASTE ULTRASONIC AROMA DIFFUSER is a decent diffuser. I definitely enjoyed the SAVASANA ULTRASONIC AROMA DIFFUSER, however, because of the larger water reservoir.  However, there are those who won&#x27;t want a diffuser to be on for more than an hour and who prefer bigger lights. If that&#x27;s the case then the Namaste might be for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was provided a sample of this item from the manufacturer for examination and possible review.</li>
            <li> I love diffuers, they have so many uses. I love to use this at night with lavender oil to help me sleep and peppermint oil is excellent for concentration and congestion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This diffuser is very nice, attractive and blends well with my decor. It&#x27;s easy to use and I really like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sample Provided</li>
            <li> Just got one of these. Colored light turns itself on (flashes) and diffuser turns itself off. If I manage to get a replacement that works better, I&#x27;ll post an update.</li>
            <li> Love these, but the sensor seems to be off. It will stop diffusing and blink even when it&#x27;s still full!</li>
            <li> This is a very pretty diffuser, the light colored imitation wood grain on the bottom looks very nice. The entire top cover lights up and will change from one color to the next, it looks very nice. If you like a specific color click the light button when it gets to the color of your choice and your color will stay lit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are three different modes of mist, click the mist button to choose Hi/Med/Lo. You get a good amount of mist on the highest setting. For the size of this diffuser, the reservoir could have been a bit larger, as it is, it only holds 120 ml of water. They could have gone with a larger water reservoir to hold more. The inside diffusing cap on most diffusers attach to the inside top of the outer cover. On this one it sits on top of the water reservoir, which takes up room that could have been used for a larger reservoir.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having the diffusing cap sit on top of the reservoir makes it a bit trickier to attach the cap after filling, but after fiddling with it a couple of times it&#x27;s not a big deal. This works great with fragrance oils and essential oils. It&#x27;s usually recommended to add one or two drops of oils, I never really count, I just shake the bottle like a salt shaker until it looks and smells about right! This has an auto off feature so if you forget to turn it off it will turn off when the water runs too low.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product sample received for review purposes.</li>
            <li> This Namaste Diffuser from TNG Worldwide is a great choice. It comes nicely packaged and with a cup to pour in your water. It operates similar to most diffusers in that you can run the lights and mist together or separately. Mist settings are low, medium, high and off. The lights change from light blue to light green to green to light blue to purple to red to light blue to blue and then repeats. When diffuser is out of water, the &amp;#34;stop&amp;#34; light flashes. I measured the amount of water to bring the tank to max and it is 100 milliliters (ml). I ran the diffuser on its lowest setting and it last around eight hours. This Namaste diffuser is an excellent choice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We received this item as a gift (free or at a discount) with no promise of posting a review.
