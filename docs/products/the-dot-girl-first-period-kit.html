            <li> The girl I bought it for likes this item. We have it put away for the right time as she has not needed it as of yet.</li>
            <li> Got this for my preteen and it came in handy and was really great for her 1st period. Would recommend to order in advance once she&#x27;s in puberty.</li>
            <li> It is a great kit for mother and daughter to be on same page during an extremely scary time in a young girls life. And assists a mother in explaining things to their precious baby who has grown up to fast</li>
            <li> I liked the zippered pouch most of all. It is discreet and could be easily concealed by my middle schooler. The pads are cheaply made and the booklet is not more than a mini calendar.</li>
            <li> My granddaughter loved this!</li>
            <li> Answered questions that I wouldn&#x27;t have thought of telling my daughter. She has not used it yet but it is informative for the girls.</li>
            <li> My 9 yr old daughter and I have gone through the American Girl book, &amp;#34;The Care &amp; Keeping of You,&amp;#34; some additional internet info, and &amp;#34;The Dot Girl First Period Kit.&amp;#34;  This kit is very nice, smallish, well-made, and includes supplies, a heating pad, hand wipes, Q&amp;A booklet &amp; a way track their first year.  I can see her refilling the kit and carrying it in her backpack for years. The kit is roughly 5&amp;#34; dia. and 1 1/2&amp;#34; thick.  At a recent sleepover, the girls compared the kit with the information in American Girl book.  I think this kit is a good healthy way for young girls to be prepared.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my grand daughter just in time.  We had the talk and i ordered this product just in time.</li>
            <li> Every young girl in the world need their own first period kit It is so helpful and makes things so much easier</li>
            <li> It is a great kit to have when anticipating the first time.  The pouch is easy to have in the book bag and will be discreet.  Bought two and all my friends are going to buy for their daughters when the time is right</li>
            <li> Love it!  Wish this was around when I was a young girl.....&lt;br /&gt;My daughter felt really comfortable and didn&#x27;t have to worry about carrying it around in her book bag at school.</li>
            <li> Purchased for my granddaughter.  She loves it and keeps it with her for her special time</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s innocuous enough, but nothing you couldn&#x27;t put together yourself.  The little cold pack is utterly cheesy.  It&#x27;s the size of a really small pancake.  A heat pad would work better if you have cramps.  I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again, but my daughter really liked it because it&#x27;s &amp;#34;cute.&amp;#34;  Cute is worth something if your daughter is scared of her first period.</li>
            <li> Looks like it will be just right when the time comes.</li>
            <li> bought as a gift for a friend to give to her young teen daughter.&lt;br /&gt;very helpful information.</li>
