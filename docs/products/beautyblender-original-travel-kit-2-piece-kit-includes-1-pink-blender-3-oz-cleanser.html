            <li>Love the sponge and the cleaner is Amazing!!!!</li>
            <li>It gives my skin that flawless look, and I feel that it works better than brushes.</li>
            <li>Just a recommendation--I use Dr Bronners Casile soap and that stuff works good too.</li>
            <li>,the cleanser works good at getting the stains out.</li>
            <li>so I thought this package would be quite a good buy.</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t do a good job</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not as good got me as some of the reviews.</li>
            <li>good service!&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li>and it literally takes me one minute to apply a full face of perfectly blended foundation.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased.</li>
            <li>Nice Kit that is good  to take on the road or even use I home.</li>
            <li>Your face will love you for it!</li>
            <li>The first time I used it, I wasn&#x27;t impressed.</li>
            <li>Absolutely love it!</li>
            <li>I love how this works!</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product!</li>
            <li>I have recommended it so many times and who takes the bite, LOVES IT!</li>
            <li>and I love it for blending my concealer and foundation!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>I love the sponge itself!</li>
            <li>I love it, works great, flawless, soft apllication!</li>
            <li>This did an amazing job.</li>
            <li>This product is absolutely amazing.</li>
            <li>soap is also amazing.  </li>
            <li>This is an amazing product.</li>
            <li>The beautyblender cleaner is amazing as well.</li>
            <li>After reading the reviews, I thought I really needed this sponge to flawlessly apply my BB cream.  </li>
            <li>and I was going out to a nice event.</li>
            <li>The cleanser is nice for makeup brushes as well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s still nice for blending undereye concelor , blush.</li>
            <li>The cleanser is so nice</li>
            <li>Honestly I don&#x27;t get what all the fuss is about with the beauty blender.</li>
            <li>It gave nice coverage</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just not a dewy kind of girl.</li>
            <li>I liked.</li>
            <li>But overall, a great buy for a wonderful product and beauty cleanser that I can use for my brushes as well.</li>
            <li>This is nice but not life changing.</li>
            <li>It fills out nicely when damp</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think I would purchase this again, but I had to try it, so I could have my own take on it.</li>
            <li>It really blends make up to give a lovely dewy glowðŸ˜„ and at 54 thats a miracle!!!</li>
            <li>it would of be nicer if it got it clean, works great though</li>
            <li>Love it, the cleaner dose a really good job .... :)</li>
            <li>My foundation has never looks more stunning!.</li>
            <li>Loooove love love it!</li>
            <li>Love this product, good quality and good price, highly recommend it  !!!</li>
            <li>But I love it, makes your foundation or bb cream look like skin blends so nicely</li>
            <li>This is by far the best make-up sponge on earth.</li>
            <li>it is more cost effective.</li>
            <li>the soap it comes with seems to be more effective than dawn.</li>
            <li>Smells good and feels so clean.</li>
            <li>There are plenty of beauty blender tutorial videos on Youtube to show just how great this really works!</li>
            <li>Very easy to use, makes your make up goes on nice and smooth.</li>
            <li>very smooth look</li>
            <li>The texture of the sponge is very light and airy.</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t really sure how to use it because mine didn&#x27;t come with instructions but after some experimenting I found out how it works.</li>
            <li>The sponge is ok, but the cleanser does not work at all.  </li>
            <li>Love the blender and love the cleaner even more.  </li>
            <li>In my opinion, it absorbs most of the product when using this sponge to apply.  </li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s fully expanded and then squeeze out most of the water.  </li>
            <li>and I was better off using the drugstore sponges.</li>
            <li>So, I wouldn&#x27;t have paid so much for it, but I thought it would  be a great investment.</li>
            <li>Would definitely recommed for a flawless face!</li>
            <li>Earth Therapeutics beauty blender is way better</li>
            <li>Love the product.</li>
            <li>Love the beauty blender.</li>
            <li>the more I dabbed</li>
            <li>the more NOTHING was happening</li>
            <li>Love the fact that i can wash it immediately to prevent germs.</li>
            <li>So love this product.</li>
            <li>but my foundation looked way better at the end of the day</li>
            <li>End of the day and my L&#x27;Oreal magic</li>
            <li>I see why so many people rave about it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in love with it</li>
            <li>Love the blender.</li>
            <li>Flawless, air brushed finish!!</li>
            <li>Everyone asks what I do it with, in love</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this product.</li>
            <li>And I love the cleanser.</li>
            <li>I love the sponge it works miracles and applies my makeup flawlessly love love love...</li>
            <li>I love this sponge.  </li>
            <li>It does so many make up tricks.  </li>
            <li>This is an authentic BB</li>
            <li>I fell in love with it</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Maybe with more use I will learn how to care for the blender better.</li>
            <li>Free shipping plus the cleaner!?</li>
            <li>When I saw the travel size beautyblender kit on Amazon for such a great price, I just had to have it!</li>
            <li>Such flawless application and blending.</li>
            <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE.</li>
            <li>I use this to apply my foundation and concealer and it applies perfectly, i cant get enough, this product is a MUST HAVE.</li>
            <li>MUCH better than fingers or even a brush.</li>
            <li>Cleaning it is the most time consuming part of the routine.</li>
            <li>Purchase at your own risk, but understand that you are NOT getting the original product.</li>
            <li>Beautyblender is known to be a very popular brand with high reviews as well as many fans.</li>
            <li>It is an amazing product that does a great job at blending together you highlighting and contouring without actually taking off the makeup on your face.</li>
            <li>Squeaky clean!</li>
            <li>If you can figure out how to keep it clean, then you&#x27;ll love it even more.</li>
            <li>Keep in mind, your face should be clean and exfoliated regularly to help with this flawless look.</li>
            <li>I heard there really was a difference between the sponge and a good foundation brush, and it turns out there is.  </li>
            <li>and I was happy with how smooth and natural the rest of my face looked.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s  easy to use.</li>
            <li>it comes with is fairly strongly lavender scented, but does the job.  </li>
            <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>the original pink is the best one in my opinion.</li>
            <li>that it&#x27;s damp on application - having to wait for my foundation/face to dry isn&#x27;t ideal</li>
            <li>Even the most novice makeup user can apply their makeup quickly and effortlessly.</li>
            <li>The day I used it, I had a huge pimple on my chin</li>
            <li>Smooth even application.</li>
            <li>Love the fresh scent of lavender in the Beauty Blender Cleanser, although the cleanser did not remove all traces of makeup on my Beauty Blender.</li>
            <li>I never knew that my foundation could go on so smoothly.</li>
            <li>The coverage was too light.</li>
            <li>Not only does it do a great job of cleaning the blender but all my makeup brushes as well.</li>
            <li>and I cringe when I purchase these, but they really are one of a kind.</li>
            <li>So far so good, I have just started using it</li>
            <li>I clean it once a week and after each use I place in a ziploc bag so it can remain clean and free of dust.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m pretty sure it is.</li>
            <li>Now that I&#x27;ve used the original</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using these for years and originally got them from the BeautyBlender site</li>
            <li>I was so excited to get this.  </li>
            <li>Totally worth the $20!</li>
            <li>Was so excited when the box came..</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried dupes of the Beauty Blender, but the original really is one of a kind and well worth the expense.  </li>
            <li>Once I got home and took off all my makeup, I used the cleanser to clean the Beauty Blender.</li>
            <li>The coverage was better than applying with a brush or my fingers, and yet somehow also looked more natural.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t tried the cleanser yet because I figure that I&#x27;ll clean the sponge about once a week (</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s probably a great product for someone who wants that natural dewy look.</li>
            <li>I ordered the Beauty Blender with the cleaner just because I do not know how else to clean it.</li>
            <li>The best way to sheer out my foundation to look super natural.</li>
            <li>I continue to use this blender about once a week in hopes that I will like it, but so far I find nothing amazing about it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not completely blaming the beauty blender, it is a nice product, and cleans up like a dream:).</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this spomge, It appplies makeup great,smooth and is super fast.</li>
            <li>Love this new lil miracle worker!</li>
            <li>it dries quickly.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s even reasonably priced for being such a great sponge.</li>
            <li>I wanted to try the beauty blender after hearing many great things about how flawless application it gives, I was debating wether to buy one of the cheaper versions of this but after reading a review of this girl who first owned an original beauty blender and then wanted to saved a couple bucks and purchased an imitation and said that its truly worth buying the real thing because the material it different and its just not the same...</li>
            <li>So first off, this is NOT the original BeautyBlender.</li>
            <li>And it seems to be much denser than the cheap wedge sponges.  </li>
            <li>So again, fantastic for drugstore makeup, not so much for hardcore.</li>
            <li>Blends makeup like I&#x27;ve never experienced allowing for a flawless makeup application.</li>
            <li>and it is worth buying the kit so that you get the cleanser.</li>
            <li>All you have to do is use the beautyblender with a stippling motion on your face where you want to blend your makeup together for a more natural look.</li>
            <li>The texture was too dense and cakey, it absorbed all my makeup and did not blend effortlessly.</li>
            <li>as far as the beauty blender, I think it is okay.</li>
            <li>The material is not the same, the tip is more rounded than the original</li>
            <li>and the cleaner works really well on the original BeautyBlender that I also have.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s just right</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just a sponge, right?  </li>
            <li>One more thing...the easiest and most efficient method to clean the beauty blender is to let it completely dry then squeeze on some Dawn Dish Liquid and gently rub it around in your hands, adding a little bit a water at a time until it comes clean, then rinse well with warm water and ring out in hands and towel.</li>
            <li>I doubt you really need a special cleanser for it.</li>
            <li>I also realized that, obviously, the better the quality of the foundation, the better the blender will work at making it looking natural and even.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure about how all these great reviews end up on here.</li>
            <li>The cleanser is great and smells like green tea!</li>
            <li>The sponge is lovely and soft and applies foundation so evenly, it&#x27;s really wonderful.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Shipping was super fast and everything was exactly like the description given.</li>
            <li>However, on my second use I had a lot more time to actually follow the steps appropriately and fully dampen the sponge and dab the makeup on.</li>
            <li>Oh, and shipping was fast!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t find that the cleanser cleans the sponge any better than regular baby shampoo, but the smell is divine.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a first time user</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be the first to admit that I&#x27;ll try just about any cosmetic or cosmetic tool.  </li>
            <li>First time using this it takes some getting used to,</li>
            <li>This is the REAL DEAL!</li>
            <li>Very usefull!  </li>
            <li>Maybe I should have read the reviews and some instructions before I first used this blender...</li>
            <li>It expanded nearly double the size and became softer, which allowed for much better coverage.</li>
            <li>a similar sponge- GO WITH THE AUTHENTIC BEAUTY BLENDER.</li>
            <li>The blender started breaking upon first cleaning after one use.</li>
            <li>I have tried regular soap and the soap that comes along with it, and I like the beauty blender soap better.</li>
            <li>, I need tools that make the process quick and look good for as long as possible throughout the day.</li>
            <li>It works really well for what it supposed to do and the price was right.  </li>
            <li>As far as the cleansing solution goes, while at first I wasn&#x27;t sure it was any different from a mild soap, but after experimenting with that also I found that it does clean the sponge better than other cleansers, but Its not a must have.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m giving it one less star since the packaging is homemade which kind of throws me off.</li>
            <li>I will soon buy the beautyblender sponge and cleanser from sephora so that I am certain I&#x27;m not getting a fast one pulled on me.</li>
            <li>It seriously is an amazing little sponge.</li>
            <li>Nice little set.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve decided to keep it however because I liked the little satchel it came in</li>
            <li>I needed something to smooth out my makeup and take the attention away from the obvious.</li>
            <li>and so much cheaper-- like $7.  </li>
            <li>Fast delivery</li>
            <li>so this helps me so much.</li>
            <li>Over all really bummed.</li>
            <li>What difference can it really make?  </li>
            <li>I did really like how the smaller end can get near your eye better though.</li>
            <li>I really like the way the Beauty Blender applies my foundation.</li>
            <li>I must say that these items seem to me not to be the real deal.</li>
            <li>It took way too much foundation.</li>
            <li>I decided to spend the money and go with the real thing</li>
            <li>application!&lt;br /&gt;Cleanser works very well!&lt;br /&gt;Received fast..</li>
            <li>I was ready to throw this away before I stumbled upon directions.</li>
            <li>Well let me just say that it blends foundation and concealer very well.</li>
            <li>It makes it so much easier to put on foundation and blush.</li>
            <li>it saves me so much time when doing my makeup</li>
            <li>and I will never go back to using cheap brushes ..</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t need to use too much foundation when using the blender.</li>
            <li>There are no stroke lines or &#x27;hot spots&#x27; that you can normally get with brushes.</li>
            <li>As for the cleaner, it is not very soapy but more like a lather.</li>
            <li>you really have to scrub the areas where makeup is embedded in order to get it all out.</li>
            <li>Sponge seems smaller than the original beautyblender and the label on the cleanser I received is lopsided.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if you&#x27;re supposed to clean it daily....</li>
            <li>Amazing little product!</li>
            <li>Good Product,the sponge is very nice,it&#x27;s not to soft not to hard</li>
            <li>Not a terrible product but definitely not worth the $16 I paid for it.  </li>
            <li>I broke down and bought one after many years of wondering what it was like.</li>
            <li>so I have 2 older ones to compare this one to.</li>
            <li>but this didn&#x27;t happen with the older ones.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>It sucked up a bunch of my make up, as I expected, and I could never get it clean no matter how much I washed it.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s well worth the extra bucks.</li>
            <li>I use it on all of my brushes and they get very clean with just a little soap.</li>
            <li>I was using a new foundation</li>
            <li>Now that I have a Beauty Blender, I can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li>Finally decided to try the authentic BeautyBlender, not really expecting to see a difference.  </li>
            <li>I love this little sponge!</li>
            <li>WOW!</li>
            <li>I wasted so much money on those cheap &amp;#34;beauty blenders&amp;#34; before I finally decided to shell out the cash for the real thing.</li>
            <li>The only positive side I see with the beauty blender: it blends quicker than my cheaper sponges which saves me time, but it also takes off a lot of the foundation.</li>
            <li>down side was the solution to clean sponge made me breakout with a rash</li>
            <li>but once I got the hang of it, it is really the only way I&#x27;ll ever apply foundation again!!!</li>
            <li>It gives a soft, airbrushed look to the makeup, as if I&#x27;m not wearing any at all.</li>
            <li>The beauty blender is worth every doller I spent on it</li>
            <li>, This was a great deal seeing  as I cant stand to see my beauty blender dirty just a little bit of the cleaner and its clean again</li>
            <li>I bought my first pink beauty blender on Amazon  6 months ago and it has completely changed the way I apply makeup...</li>
            <li>This new one has a funny tip, like a bit of extra foam or something mishapen, and when I put it in water the water turned pink.</li>
            <li>Love the little pink mesh bag bc</li>
            <li>It did not come sealed inside of the original manufacturer packaging and was quite likely previously used.</li>
            <li>No other way to apply foundation, concealer, power to set concealer and cream blush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Ladies: Don&#x27;t forget to wet then ring out the Beauty Blender with your hands then by placing in a dry towel and giving it a quick squeeze before applying your foundation, then pounce, pounce, pounce on that foundation.</li>
            <li>and I finally said screw it and used my old sponge.</li>
            <li>no pink bag, ORRRR</li>
            <li>Even though it sat for over 6 hours, all the marks and makeup came right off with a little cleanser and water and some massaging.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard to clean the sponge with the cleaner that came with the sponge.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t get some of the makeup off my blender but could just be that my foundation is hard to clean off.</li>
            <li>Also the beauty blender was white not pink.....</li>
            <li>Nope.&lt;br /&gt;The cleaner removed all of the makeup used EXCEPT for the doublewear, (which I really didn&#x27;t expect it to, because seriously, that mess is made to stay) and it smelled really clean.</li>

            <li> It gives my skin that flawless look, and I feel that it works better than brushes.</li>
            <li> Just a recommendation--I use Dr Bronners Casile soap and that stuff works good too.</li>
            <li> ,the cleanser works good at getting the stains out.</li>
            <li> so I thought this package would be quite a good buy.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t do a good job</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as good got me as some of the reviews.</li>
            <li> good service!&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li> and it literally takes me one minute to apply a full face of perfectly blended foundation.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased.</li>
            <li> Nice Kit that is good  to take on the road or even use I home.</li>
            <li> Your face will love you for it!</li>
            <li> The first time I used it, I wasn&#x27;t impressed.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love it!</li>
            <li> I love how this works!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product!</li>
            <li> I have recommended it so many times and who takes the bite, LOVES IT!</li>

            <li> This did an amazing job.</li>
            <li> This product is absolutely amazing.</li>
            <li> soap is also amazing.  </li>
            <li> This is an amazing product.</li>
            <li> The beautyblender cleaner is amazing as well.</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews, I thought I really needed this sponge to flawlessly apply my BB cream.  </li>
            <li> and I was going out to a nice event.</li>
            <li> The cleanser is nice for makeup brushes as well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s still nice for blending undereye concelor , blush.</li>
            <li> The cleanser is so nice</li>
            <li> Honestly I don&#x27;t get what all the fuss is about with the beauty blender.</li>
            <li> It gave nice coverage</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just not a dewy kind of girl.</li>
            <li> I liked.</li>
            <li> But overall, a great buy for a wonderful product and beauty cleanser that I can use for my brushes as well.</li>
            <li> This is nice but not life changing.</li>
            <li> It fills out nicely when damp</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I would purchase this again, but I had to try it, so I could have my own take on it.</li>
            <li> It really blends make up to give a lovely dewy glowðŸ˜„ and at 54 thats a miracle!!!</li>
            <li> it would of be nicer if it got it clean, works great though</li>
            <li> Love it, the cleaner dose a really good job .... :)</li>
            <li> My foundation has never looks more stunning!.</li>
            <li> Loooove love love it!</li>
            <li> Love this product, good quality and good price, highly recommend it  !!!</li>
            <li> But I love it, makes your foundation or bb cream look like skin blends so nicely</li>
            <li> This is by far the best make-up sponge on earth.</li>
            <li> it is more cost effective.</li>
            <li> the soap it comes with seems to be more effective than dawn.</li>
            <li> Smells good and feels so clean.</li>
            <li> There are plenty of beauty blender tutorial videos on Youtube to show just how great this really works!</li>
            <li> Very easy to use, makes your make up goes on nice and smooth.</li>
            <li> very smooth look</li>
            <li> The texture of the sponge is very light and airy.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t really sure how to use it because mine didn&#x27;t come with instructions but after some experimenting I found out how it works.</li>
            <li> The sponge is ok, but the cleanser does not work at all.  </li>
            <li> Love the blender and love the cleaner even more.  </li>
            <li> In my opinion, it absorbs most of the product when using this sponge to apply.  </li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s fully expanded and then squeeze out most of the water.  </li>
            <li> and I was better off using the drugstore sponges.</li>
            <li> So, I wouldn&#x27;t have paid so much for it, but I thought it would  be a great investment.</li>
            <li> Would definitely recommed for a flawless face!</li>
            <li> Earth Therapeutics beauty blender is way better</li>
            <li> Love the product.</li>
            <li> Love the beauty blender.</li>
            <li> the more I dabbed</li>
            <li> the more NOTHING was happening</li>
            <li> Love the fact that i can wash it immediately to prevent germs.</li>
            <li> So love this product.</li>
            <li> but my foundation looked way better at the end of the day</li>
            <li> End of the day and my L&#x27;Oreal magic</li>
            <li> I see why so many people rave about it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with it</li>
            <li> Love the blender.</li>
            <li> Flawless, air brushed finish!!</li>
            <li> Everyone asks what I do it with, in love</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product.</li>
            <li> And I love the cleanser.</li>
            <li> I love the sponge it works miracles and applies my makeup flawlessly love love love...</li>
            <li> I love this sponge.  </li>
            <li> It does so many make up tricks.  </li>
            <li> This is an authentic BB</li>
            <li> I fell in love with it</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> Maybe with more use I will learn how to care for the blender better.</li>
            <li> Free shipping plus the cleaner!?</li>
            <li> When I saw the travel size beautyblender kit on Amazon for such a great price, I just had to have it!</li>
            <li> Such flawless application and blending.</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE.</li>
            <li> I use this to apply my foundation and concealer and it applies perfectly, i cant get enough, this product is a MUST HAVE.</li>
            <li> MUCH better than fingers or even a brush.</li>
            <li> Cleaning it is the most time consuming part of the routine.</li>
            <li> Purchase at your own risk, but understand that you are NOT getting the original product.</li>
            <li> Beautyblender is known to be a very popular brand with high reviews as well as many fans.</li>
            <li> It is an amazing product that does a great job at blending together you highlighting and contouring without actually taking off the makeup on your face.</li>
            <li> Squeaky clean!</li>
            <li> If you can figure out how to keep it clean, then you&#x27;ll love it even more.</li>
            <li> Keep in mind, your face should be clean and exfoliated regularly to help with this flawless look.</li>
            <li> I heard there really was a difference between the sponge and a good foundation brush, and it turns out there is.  </li>
            <li> and I was happy with how smooth and natural the rest of my face looked.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s  easy to use.</li>
            <li> it comes with is fairly strongly lavender scented, but does the job.  </li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> the original pink is the best one in my opinion.</li>
            <li> that it&#x27;s damp on application - having to wait for my foundation/face to dry isn&#x27;t ideal</li>
            <li> Even the most novice makeup user can apply their makeup quickly and effortlessly.</li>
            <li> The day I used it, I had a huge pimple on my chin</li>
            <li> Smooth even application.</li>
            <li> Love the fresh scent of lavender in the Beauty Blender Cleanser, although the cleanser did not remove all traces of makeup on my Beauty Blender.</li>
            <li> I never knew that my foundation could go on so smoothly.</li>
            <li> The coverage was too light.</li>
            <li> Not only does it do a great job of cleaning the blender but all my makeup brushes as well.</li>
            <li> and I cringe when I purchase these, but they really are one of a kind.</li>
            <li> So far so good, I have just started using it</li>
            <li> I clean it once a week and after each use I place in a ziploc bag so it can remain clean and free of dust.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m pretty sure it is.</li>
            <li> Now that I&#x27;ve used the original</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these for years and originally got them from the BeautyBlender site</li>
            <li> I was so excited to get this.  </li>
            <li> Totally worth the $20!</li>
            <li> Was so excited when the box came..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried dupes of the Beauty Blender, but the original really is one of a kind and well worth the expense.  </li>
            <li> Once I got home and took off all my makeup, I used the cleanser to clean the Beauty Blender.</li>
            <li> The coverage was better than applying with a brush or my fingers, and yet somehow also looked more natural.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried the cleanser yet because I figure that I&#x27;ll clean the sponge about once a week (</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s probably a great product for someone who wants that natural dewy look.</li>
            <li> I ordered the Beauty Blender with the cleaner just because I do not know how else to clean it.</li>
            <li> The best way to sheer out my foundation to look super natural.</li>
            <li> I continue to use this blender about once a week in hopes that I will like it, but so far I find nothing amazing about it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not completely blaming the beauty blender, it is a nice product, and cleans up like a dream:).</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this spomge, It appplies makeup great,smooth and is super fast.</li>
            <li> Love this new lil miracle worker!</li>
            <li> it dries quickly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s even reasonably priced for being such a great sponge.</li>
            <li> I wanted to try the beauty blender after hearing many great things about how flawless application it gives, I was debating wether to buy one of the cheaper versions of this but after reading a review of this girl who first owned an original beauty blender and then wanted to saved a couple bucks and purchased an imitation and said that its truly worth buying the real thing because the material it different and its just not the same...</li>
            <li> So first off, this is NOT the original BeautyBlender.</li>
            <li> And it seems to be much denser than the cheap wedge sponges.  </li>
            <li> So again, fantastic for drugstore makeup, not so much for hardcore.</li>
            <li> Blends makeup like I&#x27;ve never experienced allowing for a flawless makeup application.</li>
            <li> and it is worth buying the kit so that you get the cleanser.</li>
            <li> All you have to do is use the beautyblender with a stippling motion on your face where you want to blend your makeup together for a more natural look.</li>
            <li> The texture was too dense and cakey, it absorbed all my makeup and did not blend effortlessly.</li>
            <li> as far as the beauty blender, I think it is okay.</li>
            <li> The material is not the same, the tip is more rounded than the original</li>
            <li> and the cleaner works really well on the original BeautyBlender that I also have.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s just right</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just a sponge, right?  </li>
            <li> One more thing...the easiest and most efficient method to clean the beauty blender is to let it completely dry then squeeze on some Dawn Dish Liquid and gently rub it around in your hands, adding a little bit a water at a time until it comes clean, then rinse well with warm water and ring out in hands and towel.</li>
            <li> I doubt you really need a special cleanser for it.</li>
            <li> I also realized that, obviously, the better the quality of the foundation, the better the blender will work at making it looking natural and even.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure about how all these great reviews end up on here.</li>
            <li> The cleanser is great and smells like green tea!</li>
            <li> The sponge is lovely and soft and applies foundation so evenly, it&#x27;s really wonderful.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Shipping was super fast and everything was exactly like the description given.</li>
            <li> However, on my second use I had a lot more time to actually follow the steps appropriately and fully dampen the sponge and dab the makeup on.</li>
            <li> Oh, and shipping was fast!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t find that the cleanser cleans the sponge any better than regular baby shampoo, but the smell is divine.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a first time user</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be the first to admit that I&#x27;ll try just about any cosmetic or cosmetic tool.  </li>
            <li> First time using this it takes some getting used to,</li>
            <li> This is the REAL DEAL!</li>
            <li> Very usefull!  </li>
            <li> Maybe I should have read the reviews and some instructions before I first used this blender...</li>
            <li> It expanded nearly double the size and became softer, which allowed for much better coverage.</li>
            <li> a similar sponge- GO WITH THE AUTHENTIC BEAUTY BLENDER.</li>
            <li> The blender started breaking upon first cleaning after one use.</li>
            <li> I have tried regular soap and the soap that comes along with it, and I like the beauty blender soap better.</li>
            <li> , I need tools that make the process quick and look good for as long as possible throughout the day.</li>
            <li> It works really well for what it supposed to do and the price was right.  </li>
            <li> As far as the cleansing solution goes, while at first I wasn&#x27;t sure it was any different from a mild soap, but after experimenting with that also I found that it does clean the sponge better than other cleansers, but Its not a must have.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving it one less star since the packaging is homemade which kind of throws me off.</li>
            <li> I will soon buy the beautyblender sponge and cleanser from sephora so that I am certain I&#x27;m not getting a fast one pulled on me.</li>
            <li> It seriously is an amazing little sponge.</li>
            <li> Nice little set.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve decided to keep it however because I liked the little satchel it came in</li>
            <li> I needed something to smooth out my makeup and take the attention away from the obvious.</li>
            <li> and so much cheaper-- like $7.  </li>
            <li> Fast delivery</li>
            <li> so this helps me so much.</li>
            <li> Over all really bummed.</li>
            <li> What difference can it really make?  </li>
            <li> I did really like how the smaller end can get near your eye better though.</li>
            <li> I really like the way the Beauty Blender applies my foundation.</li>
            <li> I must say that these items seem to me not to be the real deal.</li>
            <li> It took way too much foundation.</li>
            <li> I decided to spend the money and go with the real thing</li>
            <li> application!&lt;br /&gt;Cleanser works very well!&lt;br /&gt;Received fast..</li>
            <li> I was ready to throw this away before I stumbled upon directions.</li>
            <li> Well let me just say that it blends foundation and concealer very well.</li>
            <li> It makes it so much easier to put on foundation and blush.</li>
            <li> it saves me so much time when doing my makeup</li>
            <li> and I will never go back to using cheap brushes ..</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t need to use too much foundation when using the blender.</li>
            <li> There are no stroke lines or &#x27;hot spots&#x27; that you can normally get with brushes.</li>
            <li> As for the cleaner, it is not very soapy but more like a lather.</li>
            <li> you really have to scrub the areas where makeup is embedded in order to get it all out.</li>
            <li> Sponge seems smaller than the original beautyblender and the label on the cleanser I received is lopsided.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if you&#x27;re supposed to clean it daily....</li>
            <li> Amazing little product!</li>
            <li> Good Product,the sponge is very nice,it&#x27;s not to soft not to hard</li>
            <li> Not a terrible product but definitely not worth the $16 I paid for it.  </li>
            <li> I broke down and bought one after many years of wondering what it was like.</li>
            <li> so I have 2 older ones to compare this one to.</li>
            <li> but this didn&#x27;t happen with the older ones.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> It sucked up a bunch of my make up, as I expected, and I could never get it clean no matter how much I washed it.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s well worth the extra bucks.</li>
            <li> I use it on all of my brushes and they get very clean with just a little soap.</li>
            <li> I was using a new foundation</li>
            <li> Now that I have a Beauty Blender, I can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li> Finally decided to try the authentic BeautyBlender, not really expecting to see a difference.  </li>
            <li> I love this little sponge!</li>
            <li> WOW!</li>
            <li> I wasted so much money on those cheap &amp;#34;beauty blenders&amp;#34; before I finally decided to shell out the cash for the real thing.</li>
            <li> The only positive side I see with the beauty blender: it blends quicker than my cheaper sponges which saves me time, but it also takes off a lot of the foundation.</li>
            <li> down side was the solution to clean sponge made me breakout with a rash</li>
            <li> but once I got the hang of it, it is really the only way I&#x27;ll ever apply foundation again!!!</li>
            <li> It gives a soft, airbrushed look to the makeup, as if I&#x27;m not wearing any at all.</li>
            <li> The beauty blender is worth every doller I spent on it</li>
            <li> , This was a great deal seeing  as I cant stand to see my beauty blender dirty just a little bit of the cleaner and its clean again</li>
            <li> I bought my first pink beauty blender on Amazon  6 months ago and it has completely changed the way I apply makeup...</li>
            <li> This new one has a funny tip, like a bit of extra foam or something mishapen, and when I put it in water the water turned pink.</li>
            <li> Love the little pink mesh bag bc</li>
            <li> It did not come sealed inside of the original manufacturer packaging and was quite likely previously used.</li>
            <li> No other way to apply foundation, concealer, power to set concealer and cream blush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Ladies: Don&#x27;t forget to wet then ring out the Beauty Blender with your hands then by placing in a dry towel and giving it a quick squeeze before applying your foundation, then pounce, pounce, pounce on that foundation.</li>
            <li> and I finally said screw it and used my old sponge.</li>
            <li> no pink bag, ORRRR</li>
            <li> Even though it sat for over 6 hours, all the marks and makeup came right off with a little cleanser and water and some massaging.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to clean the sponge with the cleaner that came with the sponge.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t get some of the makeup off my blender but could just be that my foundation is hard to clean off.</li>
            <li> Also the beauty blender was white not pink.....</li>
            <li> Nope.&lt;br /&gt;The cleaner removed all of the makeup used EXCEPT for the doublewear, (which I really didn&#x27;t expect it to, because seriously, that mess is made to stay) and it smelled really clean.</li>
            <li> Though they do last a long time it will eventually start to fall apart</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money or time on other sponges that are wannabe&#x27;s, buy the real deal.</li>
            <li> thats the only reason im only giving 4 stars other then</li>
            <li> The bottom of mine is also not completely even.&lt;br /&gt;What</li>
            <li> I ordered the pink beauty blender, with the cleanser and instead received a white beauty blender &amp; no cleanser.</li>
            <li> I do recommend washing the sponge after every use to prevent staining that is harder to remove later.</li>
            <li> lasted it a long time</li>
            <li> Definitely use this wet!</li>
            <li> Product arrived earlier than expected too!</li>
            <li> I will never go back to any other brush/sponge.</li>
            <li> if I&#x27;m in a hurry.&lt;br /&gt;The one I received, at least, is hard to clean (with the beautyblender cleaner) and get all the makeup out of.</li>
            <li> I received this item inside a bag that had been loosely tied together.  </li>
            <li> I usually use my fingers, but the BB sponge used in the proper stippling motion just made the foundation look different.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an avid BeautyBlender user and the cleanser is so expensive- especially in the travel size.</li>
            <li> I still have the same Beauty Blender with the little split at the point</li>
            <li> so the not properly placed label on the cleanser bottle really bothered me because it made the cleanser look like a fake.</li>
            <li> I do like the round shape of the sponge as opposed to the wedge sponges I&#x27;ve used in the last.  </li>
            <li> It is also not a cheap low quality brand</li>
            <li> Was a pain getting it wet and cleaning it at each application.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know they suggest to wet it before use.</li>
            <li> I watched a tutorial on Youtube about this and became curious, so I just had to try it.</li>
            <li> It has a small split in the point on the top of the blender, that will continue to rip I&#x27;m afraid.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way</li>
            <li> I used other sponges to blend my foundation</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first but after trying it I now see what all the hype was about.</li>
            <li> I know things change and are constantly being manufactured differently (usually cheaper and to save money)</li>
            <li> I have tried other cheaper brands and they don&#x27;t compare...</li>
            <li> Once you use them, you will toss all your other makeup applicators.  </li>
            <li> cleanser, the bb was a fake, the photo shows exactly what I got from the box.</li>
            <li> a small yellow tear drop shaped sponge that boasted to be identical.</li>
            <li> I simply dab it all over in small stippling like motions.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll use it for sure since I spent the $, but I hate that I even have to question authenticity OR accept that they may just be of lower quality now.</li>
            <li> Took a few tries</li>
            <li> and I found it made me skin look very dewy, which I hate since I&#x27;m normally oily and just want matte skin.</li>
            <li> and omg i cant put the damn thing down.</li>
            <li> All I got was a very small white beauty blender.</li>
            <li> Buy this over the synthetic imitation sponges!</li>
            <li> and I use less product</li>
            <li> I use less foundation</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s less durable.</li>
            <li> the cleanser doesnt get your beauty blender clean. :(</li>
            <li> It was a waste of money for me.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Makes me want to makeup everyday.</li>
            <li> I feel I wasted my money.</li>
            <li> The two stars are for the packaging and cleaner only, no stars however for false advertising.</li>
            <li> This is disappointing for a product being advertised as brand new.</li>
            <li> Give it a try, I&#x27;m obsessed with this thing and have repurchased several since.</li>
            <li> It does put on makeup evenly, but I&#x27;m not sure I like</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure about this.</li>
            <li> the blender is not very good</li>
            <li> I have a hard time covering my nose foundation usually just melts off my nose</li>
            <li> You could hardly see the pimple</li>
            <li> I have never liked doing makeup.</li>
            <li> the only complaint I have is after 2 times of using the sponge it started getting little rips :((  </li>
            <li> I checked for cheaper alternatives but the ones i found all had horrible reviews, i was hesitant to dish 20 dollars on this, but i must say it is DEFINITELY worth the price.</li>
            <li> (the secret to esteee lauder is it&#x27;s buildable)</li>
            <li> and I had zero shine, which is something I&#x27;ve never experienced before.  </li>
            <li> : I am not happy with my Beautyblender.</li>
            <li> I was the worse at blending foundation and concealers.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t understand the all the hype until I tired it</li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;m just doing it wrong.  </li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t tell you if it&#x27;s a fake or</li>
            <li> That makeup is like the holy grail of makeup, water proof, sweat proof, but it&#x27;s expensive and takes the strength of seven elephants to remove</li>
            <li> It worked, don&#x27;t get me wrong.</li>
            <li> The sponge, when I used it per directions, does blend the makeup beautfiully, but is no good if you have any concealer going down (or in my case you don&#x27;t use concealer with the base, it just wouldn&#x27;t apply the base over a scar correctly).</li>
            <li> Disappointing for me.</li>
            <li> WRONG!</li>
            <li> So disappointed........</li>
            <li> Was kinda disappointed.</li>
            <li> However, I HATE the liquid cleaner.</li>
            <li> VERY disappointed in what I received.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Totally awesome product. Wasn&#x27;t really sure how to use it because mine didn&#x27;t come with instructions but after some experimenting I found out how it works. You soak it thoroughly in water then squeeze out excess water (Water should not be dripping from it while your applying your makeup) LoL a mistake I initially made. I apply my foundation to my face (lil bit of dots here &amp; there) then blend by a patting/dabbing motion all over. Blends makeup like I&#x27;ve never experienced allowing for a flawless makeup application. Give it a try, I&#x27;m obsessed with this thing and have repurchased several since. Though they do last a long time it will eventually start to fall apart and that&#x27;s when I repurchase. As far as the cleansing solution goes, while at first I wasn&#x27;t sure it was any different from a mild soap, but after experimenting with that also I found that it does clean the sponge better than other cleansers, but Its not a must have. Just a recommendation--I use Dr Bronners Casile soap and that stuff works good too.</li>
            <li> The sponge is ok, but the cleanser does not work at all.  I definitely would not recommend this for $20.  It was a waste of money for me.</li>
            <li> This is HEAVEN! I wasted so much money on those cheap &amp;#34;beauty blenders&amp;#34; before I finally decided to shell out the cash for the real thing. Jaclyn Hill always talks me into spending my money! Just buy it people! This thing is AMAZING! Your face will love you for it!</li>
            <li> Love the blender and love the cleaner even more.  I use it on all of my brushes and they get very clean with just a little soap.</li>
            <li> Overrated!  Not a terrible product but definitely not worth the $16 I paid for it.  I suggest going with a knockoff brand.... IT&#x27;S A GLORIFIED SPONGE!!!!</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews, I thought I really needed this sponge to flawlessly apply my BB cream.  In my opinion, it absorbs most of the product when using this sponge to apply.  I saturate the sponge with water so it&#x27;s fully expanded and then squeeze out most of the water.  Maybe I&#x27;m just doing it wrong.  I do like the round shape of the sponge as opposed to the wedge sponges I&#x27;ve used in the last.  And it seems to be much denser than the cheap wedge sponges.  For the price, I would not buy it again.</li>
            <li> Blends beautifully. Great cleanser too. Can also be used on makeup brushes. Love the little pink mesh bag bc it dries quickly.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it, I wasn&#x27;t impressed. I thought it made my makeup look cakey and I was better off using the drugstore sponges. However, on my second use I had a lot more time to actually follow the steps appropriately and fully dampen the sponge and dab the makeup on. I could not be any happier with the results. The day I used it, I had a huge pimple on my chin and I was going out to a nice event. I needed something to smooth out my makeup and take the attention away from the obvious. This did an amazing job. You could hardly see the pimple and I was happy with how smooth and natural the rest of my face looked. I also realized that, obviously, the better the quality of the foundation, the better the blender will work at making it looking natural and even. I was using a new foundation and I noticed around the pimple that it was starting to wear off. This isn&#x27;t the Beauty Blender&#x27;s fault. It seriously is an amazing little sponge. The cleanser that comes with it works well. I didn&#x27;t get to wash mine until hours after I had used it because I did my makeup and had to run out the door. Once I got home and took off all my makeup, I used the cleanser to clean the Beauty Blender. Even though it sat for over 6 hours, all the marks and makeup came right off with a little cleanser and water and some massaging. Definitely give it a try and it is worth buying the kit so that you get the cleanser.</li>
            <li> It does put on makeup evenly, but I&#x27;m not sure I like that it&#x27;s damp on application - having to wait for my foundation/face to dry isn&#x27;t ideal if I&#x27;m in a hurry.&lt;br /&gt;The one I received, at least, is hard to clean (with the beautyblender cleaner) and get all the makeup out of. I think this morning I put cleaner on and diligently cleaned for about 10 minutes. Gave up after that with some makeup still in the bottom.&lt;br /&gt;I read makeup isn&#x27;t supposed to seep into the sponge. Surprise, it does in mine! The bottom of mine is also not completely even.&lt;br /&gt;What&#x27;s up, BB? Did I get a dud?</li>
            <li> Beauty blenders are the truth. I preach on this product! Don&#x27;t be fooled by the cheaper versions out there - they don&#x27;t work like these do. It can blend miracles into your face.</li>
            <li> Nice little set. The cleanser is nice for makeup brushes as well. A beauty blender is a must have.</li>
            <li> Did not receive cleanser, only sponge.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s all that its cracked up to be. It&#x27;s definitely hyped through tactful marketing strategies. I used other sponges to blend my foundation and I like them versus the beauty blender. The only positive side I see with the beauty blender: it blends quicker than my cheaper sponges which saves me time, but it also takes off a lot of the foundation. It&#x27;s hard to clean the sponge with the cleaner that came with the sponge. I&#x27;m not sure about how all these great reviews end up on here. So, I wouldn&#x27;t have paid so much for it, but I thought it would  be a great investment. WRONG! Never again.&lt;br /&gt; Oh, and shipping was fast!</li>
            <li> This works wonders at applying liquid foundation and gives the look of an airbrushed finish. Would definitely recommed for a flawless face!</li>
            <li> Earth Therapeutics beauty blender is way better and so much cheaper-- like $7.  Get it from Kohl&#x27;s....thank me later.</li>
            <li> Works great! Love the product. Fast delivery</li>
            <li> Love the beauty blender. I will never be without it.</li>
            <li> I received this item inside a bag that had been loosely tied together.  It did not come sealed inside of the original manufacturer packaging and was quite likely previously used.This is disappointing for a product being advertised as brand new. Do not trust this seller!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried dupes of the Beauty Blender, but the original really is one of a kind and well worth the expense.  I was glad that the cleaner came in this set, as this is likely the only way I would have tried since it&#x27;s so expensive.  I don&#x27;t find that the cleanser cleans the sponge any better than regular baby shampoo, but the smell is divine.  I would buy the cleanser again on sale, or if it came as part of a kit like this.</li>
            <li> Good Product,the sponge is very nice,it&#x27;s not to soft not to hard it&#x27;s just right it puts your foundation on beautiful,the cleanser works good at getting the stains out.I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> the cleanser doesnt get your beauty blender clean. :( it would of be nicer if it got it clean, works great though</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this spomge, It appplies makeup great,smooth and is super fast. I&#x27;m not an expert at makeup application so this helps me so much.</li>
            <li> When my beauty blender arrived I was expecting to get what I payed for, not only was it a white tiny one, it also didn&#x27;t come with the cleaning solution. I&#x27;m a first time user so I can&#x27;t tell you if it&#x27;s a fake or not but I&#x27;m pretty sure it is. Over all really bummed. When I get enough courage to pay another twenty dollars for a sponge will be going anywhere but this seller.</li>
            <li> Arrived within two days and the product is great! Cleanser works great on my brushes, too. I&#x27;ll definitely get another one when I wear this one out !</li>
            <li> So, i have cystic acne scars and rosacia. Yes, it is unglamourous, and I use estee lauder&#x27;s double wear to cover it. That makeup is like the holy grail of makeup, water proof, sweat proof, but it&#x27;s expensive and takes the strength of seven elephants to remove so I thought this package would be quite a good buy. The sponge, when I used it per directions, does blend the makeup beautfiully, but is no good if you have any concealer going down (or in my case you don&#x27;t use concealer with the base, it just wouldn&#x27;t apply the base over a scar correctly). the more I dabbed (the secret to esteee lauder is it&#x27;s buildable) the more NOTHING was happening and I finally said screw it and used my old sponge. It does blend, beautifully even on the spots I didn&#x27;t need concealer, but where I did? Nope.&lt;br /&gt;The cleaner removed all of the makeup used EXCEPT for the doublewear, (which I really didn&#x27;t expect it to, because seriously, that mess is made to stay) and it smelled really clean. So again, fantastic for drugstore makeup, not so much for hardcore.</li>
            <li> I ordered the pink beauty blender, with the cleanser and instead received a white beauty blender &amp; no cleanser. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice kit. The beauty blender beware is very tiny. It&#x27;s not the regular size. It&#x27;s still nice for blending undereye concelor , blush. The cleanser is so nice and it&#x27;s also great for makeup brushes</li>
            <li> Best thing invented! I love it, works great, flawless, soft apllication!</li>
            <li> There are plenty of beauty blender tutorial videos on Youtube to show just how great this really works! I do recommend washing the sponge after every use to prevent staining that is harder to remove later.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love it! I was skeptical at first but after trying it I now see what all the hype was about. Definitely would recommend.</li>
            <li> I love how this works! Took a few tries but once I got the hang of it, it is really the only way I&#x27;ll ever apply foundation again!!!</li>
            <li> Love this new lil miracle worker! It really blends make up to give a lovely dewy glowðŸ˜„ and at 54 thats a miracle!!!</li>
            <li> Makes me want to makeup everyday. Love the fact that i can wash it immediately to prevent germs. So love this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be the first to admit that I&#x27;ll try just about any cosmetic or cosmetic tool.  Finally decided to try the authentic BeautyBlender, not really expecting to see a difference.  It&#x27;s just a sponge, right?  What difference can it really make?  I&#x27;ve been using it for only two days now with my inexpensive, drugstore foundations (L&#x27;Oreal and Revlon)&lt;br /&gt;What.  A.  Difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously.  I usually use my fingers, but the BB sponge used in the proper stippling motion just made the foundation look different.  The coverage was better than applying with a brush or my fingers, and yet somehow also looked more natural.  Not only that, but my foundation looked way better at the end of the day and I had zero shine, which is something I&#x27;ve never experienced before.  End of the day and my L&#x27;Oreal magic nude foundation was still perfectly matte.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll definitely post an update as I continue to use the sponge.  I haven&#x27;t tried the cleanser yet because I figure that I&#x27;ll clean the sponge about once a week (but I rinse it well every day once I&#x27;m done).  I don&#x27;t know if you&#x27;re supposed to clean it daily....I&#x27;ll have to look into that</li>
            <li> Why I haven&#x27;t ordered the Beauty Blender sooner, I have no idea. I absolutely love this product! The cleanser is great and smells like green tea! Shipping was super fast and everything was exactly like the description given. I know at Sephora the beauty blender by itself is around $20.00, so the fact that I can get the cleanser with it was a big plus. Thank you Amazon for selling this!</li>
            <li> First time using this it takes some getting used to, But I love it, makes your foundation or bb cream look like skin blends so nicely, This was a great deal seeing  as I cant stand to see my beauty blender dirty just a little bit of the cleaner and its clean again</li>
            <li> Best Purchase! I love this thing!!!</li>
            <li> Love it, the cleaner dose a really good job .... :)</li>
            <li> This product is absolutely amazing. My foundation has never looks more stunning!. I have a hard time covering my nose foundation usually just melts off my nose but the beauty blender helps it stay! Definitely use this wet! Loooove love love it!</li>
            <li> Honestly I don&#x27;t get what all the fuss is about with the beauty blender. It worked, don&#x27;t get me wrong. It gave nice coverage and I found it made me skin look very dewy, which I hate since I&#x27;m normally oily and just want matte skin. I&#x27;m just not a dewy kind of girl. It sucked up a bunch of my make up, as I expected, and I could never get it clean no matter how much I washed it. I went back to my brushes.&lt;br /&gt;In the end it&#x27;s probably a great product for someone who wants that natural dewy look. If you can figure out how to keep it clean, then you&#x27;ll love it even more. I did really like how the smaller end can get near your eye better though.</li>
            <li> I had purchased knockoff blenders and didn&#x27;t get all the fuss. Now that I&#x27;ve used the original I see why so many people rave about it. My makeup looks flawless when applied with the Beauty Blender.</li>
            <li> No other way to apply foundation, concealer, power to set concealer and cream blush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best all around tool.  BeautyBlender all the way!</li>
            <li> My wife bough this with my account and I asked her to rate it,...she said four stars.  It works really well for what it supposed to do and the price was right.  If you have questions please ask and I will ask her for you.</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> the blender is not very good</li>
            <li> This is the REAL DEAL! I really like the way the Beauty Blender applies my foundation. Smooth even application. No brush strokes here. Ladies: Don&#x27;t forget to wet then ring out the Beauty Blender with your hands then by placing in a dry towel and giving it a quick squeeze before applying your foundation, then pounce, pounce, pounce on that foundation. Love the fresh scent of lavender in the Beauty Blender Cleanser, although the cleanser did not remove all traces of makeup on my Beauty Blender. Product arrived earlier than expected too! UPDATE DECEMBER 13, 2014: I am not happy with my Beautyblender. It has a small split in the point on the top of the blender, that will continue to rip I&#x27;m afraid. For this reason I will not be repurchasing.Update January 8, 2015. I still have the same Beauty Blender with the little split at the point but it has not continued to tear, therefore I will purchase again.One more thing...the easiest and most efficient method to clean the beauty blender is to let it completely dry then squeeze on some Dawn Dish Liquid and gently rub it around in your hands, adding a little bit a water at a time until it comes clean, then rinse well with warm water and ring out in hands and towel. The End</li>
            <li> Flawless application very smooth look I&#x27;m in love with it however that cleanser that comes with it doesn&#x27;t do a good job</li>
            <li> I bought the beauty blender to use with my BB cream and it would not blend. I&#x27;m not completely blaming the beauty blender, it is a nice product, and cleans up like a dream:). I will try it with make up at some point and see how it goes.</li>
            <li> Love the blender. Works wonders with my CC cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The soap is also amazing.  I wash my brushes with them as well. Squeaky clean!</li>
            <li> I saw a friend of mine using this and she said she swears by it.  So far so good, I have just started using it and I am very happy with it.  Very easy to use, makes your make up goes on nice and smooth.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best make-up sponge on earth. I have recommended it so many times and who takes the bite, LOVES IT! Flawless, air brushed finish!! Everyone asks what I do it with, in love</li>
            <li> Very usefull!  I liked.</li>
            <li> remember to wash it after each use</li>
            <li> Love the sponge and the cleaner is Amazing!!!!</li>
            <li> Amazing little product! I never knew that my foundation could go on so smoothly. Does not work with serum-type foundations though, only standard liquid consistency.</li>
            <li> This is a great deal. I&#x27;m an avid BeautyBlender user and the cleanser is so expensive- especially in the travel size.</li>
            <li> I just received the &amp;#34;alleged&amp;#34; beautyblender and beautyblender cleanser.  I must say that these items seem to me not to be the real deal. Sponge seems smaller than the original beautyblender and the label on the cleanser I received is lopsided. Beautyblender is known to be a very popular brand with high reviews as well as many fans. It is also not a cheap low quality brand so the not properly placed label on the cleanser bottle really bothered me because it made the cleanser look like a fake. I will soon buy the beautyblender sponge and cleanser from sephora so that I am certain I&#x27;m not getting a fast one pulled on me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as good got me as some of the reviews. It took way too much foundation. The coverage was too light. Almost no coverage unless I basically doused it with foundation. Was a pain getting it wet and cleaning it at each application. I feel I wasted my money. Disappointing for me.</li>
            <li> Love this product, good quality and good price, highly recommend it  !!!</li>
            <li> I have never liked doing makeup. Because I have always sucked at it. I was the worse at blending foundation and concealers. The Beauty Blender is the best thing to have hit the market in my opinion. It&#x27;s  easy to use. Even the most novice makeup user can apply their makeup quickly and effortlessly. I highly recommend. I also like the cleaner but I don&#x27;t feel it is a necessity.</li>
            <li> I wanted to try the beauty blender after hearing many great things about how flawless application it gives, I was debating wether to buy one of the cheaper versions of this but after reading a review of this girl who first owned an original beauty blender and then wanted to saved a couple bucks and purchased an imitation and said that its truly worth buying the real thing because the material it different and its just not the same...anyway  I decided to spend the money and go with the real thing and im glad I did because I get a flawless application everytime and works with great!</li>
            <li> Love beauty blender!!! Great foundation application!&lt;br /&gt;Cleanser works very well!&lt;br /&gt;Received fast..good service!&lt;br /&gt;Will purchase again!</li>
            <li> lasted it a long time</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure about this. I&#x27;ve been using these for years and originally got them from the BeautyBlender site so I have 2 older ones to compare this one to. This new one has a funny tip, like a bit of extra foam or something mishapen, and when I put it in water the water turned pink. I know things change and are constantly being manufactured differently (usually cheaper and to save money) but this didn&#x27;t happen with the older ones. I&#x27;ll use it for sure since I spent the $, but I hate that I even have to question authenticity OR accept that they may just be of lower quality now.</li>
            <li> Maybe I should have read the reviews and some instructions before I first used this blender... I didn&#x27;t know they suggest to wet it before use. WOW! What a difference. It expanded nearly double the size and became softer, which allowed for much better coverage. I was ready to throw this away before I stumbled upon directions. I love it. Buy this over the synthetic imitation sponges!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product. It is the best purchase I have ever made. It puts on foundation perfectly that it looks flawless. Don&#x27;t waste your money or time on other sponges that are wannabe&#x27;s, buy the real deal. It&#x27;s even reasonably priced for being such a great sponge.</li>
            <li> I watched a tutorial on Youtube about this and became curious, so I just had to try it. Well let me just say that it blends foundation and concealer very well. It gives my skin that flawless look, and I feel that it works better than brushes. I will admit that I do not always use the cleanser after use like you are supposed to, but it still does a great job. I clean it once a week and after each use I place in a ziploc bag so it can remain clean and free of dust.</li>
            <li> I love this little sponge! It makes it so much easier to put on foundation and blush. The cleaning solution gets all the makeup out with just a dime sized amount. Will definitely buy again when I wear this one out.</li>
            <li> I bought my first pink beauty blender on Amazon  6 months ago and it has completely changed the way I apply makeup...I&#x27;m not a makeup afficianado in anyway, I need tools that make the process quick and look good for as long as possible throughout the day. I have tried other cheaper brands and they don&#x27;t compare... the original pink is the best one in my opinion. And I love the cleanser. Smells good and feels so clean. I&#x27;m on my 2nd blender now.</li>
            <li> These are awesome! Once you use them, you will toss all your other makeup applicators.  They are also great gifts.</li>
            <li> I love the sponge it works miracles and applies my makeup flawlessly love love love...&lt;br /&gt;the down side was the solution to clean sponge made me breakout with a rash must be something i am allergic to.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t understand the all the hype until I tired it and omg i cant put the damn thing down. I use it to apply every makeup except lipstick.</li>
            <li> I love this sponge.  It does so many make up tricks.  I gave 4 of them as Christmas gifts.</li>
            <li> This is an authentic BB and I love it for blending my concealer and foundation! I&#x27;m giving it one less star since the packaging is homemade which kind of throws me off. But overall, a great buy for a wonderful product and beauty cleanser that I can use for my brushes as well. I&#x27;ve been using it for over a month and I just can&#x27;t believe how flawless it blends. Keep in mind, your face should be clean and exfoliated regularly to help with this flawless look.</li>
            <li> The beauty blender is worth every doller I spent on it I use to use a $3 brush to apply my liquid foundation and I thought it did a great job till my beauty blender arrived it saves me so much time when doing my makeup and I use less product when im using this sponge and it leaves your foundation looking perfect and flawless it I fell in love with it and I will never go back to using cheap brushes .. the only complaint I have is after 2 times of using the sponge it started getting little rips :((  thats the only reason im only giving 4 stars other then that this sponge is awesome!</li>
            <li> I was so excited to get this.  I actually re-applied my foundation just to try it.  This is an amazing product.</li>
            <li> I am always watching girls on Youtube do their makeup and they all swear by this Beauty Blender. I broke down and bought one after many years of wondering what it was like. I love this product. I don&#x27;t need to use too much foundation when using the blender. It gives a soft, airbrushed look to the makeup, as if I&#x27;m not wearing any at all. There are no stroke lines or &#x27;hot spots&#x27; that you can normally get with brushes. I am very pleased. As for the cleaner, it is not very soapy but more like a lather. It didn&#x27;t get some of the makeup off my blender but could just be that my foundation is hard to clean off. I ordered the Beauty Blender with the cleaner just because I do not know how else to clean it. Maybe with more use I will learn how to care for the blender better. Overall, I would definitely recommend this! Free shipping plus the cleaner!? Totally worth the $20!</li>
            <li> My beauty blender is awesome. The best way to sheer out my foundation to look super natural.</li>
            <li> When I saw the travel size beautyblender kit on Amazon for such a great price, I just had to have it! I kept hearing all this hype about the beautyblender and when I finally tried it for myself, I had to agree with everyone. It is an amazing product that does a great job at blending together you highlighting and contouring without actually taking off the makeup on your face. All you have to do is use the beautyblender with a stippling motion on your face where you want to blend your makeup together for a more natural look. The beautyblender cleaner is amazing as well. Not only does it do a great job of cleaning the blender but all my makeup brushes as well. A little bit goes a long way so it lasts too! I would recommend this product to anyone and everyone.</li>
            <li> I love it! I don&#x27;t even want to remember what my makeup looked like before I started using the blender ball.</li>
            <li> is this a joke. I didnt receive what was advertised. instead I got this.&lt;br /&gt;no cleanser, the bb was a fake, the photo shows exactly what I got from the box. didnt even open it</li>
            <li> Now that I have a Beauty Blender, I can&#x27;t live without it. Such flawless application and blending. I&#x27;m going to buy a backup for touch ups. LOVE LOVE LOVE.</li>
            <li> Nice Kit that is good  to take on the road or even use I home. I take this on my roadtrips!</li>
            <li> This is nice but not life changing.</li>
            <li> Of course, I was expecting it bigger)) but i like it !</li>
            <li> So disappointed........ Was so excited when the box came..opened it and it was ONE white beauty blender...no pink bag, ORRRR the cleaner.. Paid $20 for basically one sponge...very upset</li>
            <li> Was kinda disappointed. Did not come with organza bag nor a cleanser. Also the beauty blender was white not pink.....</li>
            <li> VERY disappointed in what I received. I never received the bag or the cleaner. All I got was a very small white beauty blender. I DO NOT RECOMMEND!!</li>
            <li> I hesitated in buying this.  I heard there really was a difference between the sponge and a good foundation brush, and it turns out there is.  The sponge is lovely and soft and applies foundation so evenly, it&#x27;s really wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cleanser it comes with is fairly strongly lavender scented, but does the job.  I doubt you really need a special cleanser for it.</li>
            <li> Great starter gift set!</li>
            <li> Its a gift for my sister</li>
            <li> I checked for cheaper alternatives but the ones i found all had horrible reviews, i was hesitant to dish 20 dollars on this, but i must say it is DEFINITELY worth the price. I use this to apply my foundation and concealer and it applies perfectly, i cant get enough, this product is a MUST HAVE. I LOVE IT!!!</li>
            <li> Let me just say, if you are contemplating buying the name brand &amp;#34;Beauty Blender&amp;#34; verses a similar sponge- GO WITH THE AUTHENTIC BEAUTY BLENDER. I know it&#x27;s pricey and I cringe when I purchase these, but they really are one of a kind. I have tried its competitor- a small yellow tear drop shaped sponge that boasted to be identical. After one use, I tossed it. The texture was too dense and cakey, it absorbed all my makeup and did not blend effortlessly. When I use the BB I use less foundation and it literally takes me one minute to apply a full face of perfectly blended foundation. The texture of the sponge is very light and airy. It fills out nicely when damp and I think applying my liquid foundation with the damp sponge allows the makeup to be applied to my face instead of sucked into the sponge. It seems to blend with such ease. MUCH better than fingers or even a brush. I simply dab it all over in small stippling like motions. And since they can be washed and reused I seem to only have to repurchase a couple times a year so all in all it&#x27;s well worth the extra bucks.</li>
            <li> So first off, this is NOT the original BeautyBlender. The material is not the same, the tip is more rounded than the original and it&#x27;s less durable. The blender started breaking upon first cleaning after one use. I&#x27;ve decided to keep it however because I liked the little satchel it came in and the cleaner works really well on the original BeautyBlender that I also have. The two stars are for the packaging and cleaner only, no stars however for false advertising. Purchase at your own risk, but understand that you are NOT getting the original product.</li>
            <li> Your best bet is to purchase the soap with blender than just the beauty blender. it is more cost effective. I have tried regular soap and the soap that comes along with it, and I like the beauty blender soap better. as far as the beauty blender, I think it is okay. I personally just like using stipple brushes. I feel like a lot of my foundation gets lost in the blender. I continue to use this blender about once a week in hopes that I will like it, but so far I find nothing amazing about it. Cleaning it is the most time consuming part of the routine. you really have to scrub the areas where makeup is embedded in order to get it all out. the soap it comes with seems to be more effective than dawn. I don&#x27;t think I would purchase this again, but I had to try it, so I could have my own take on it.</li>
            <li> I received the mini blender only.  No sight of the shampoo</li>
            <li> I received a white beauty blender and no cleanser. Returned immediately!</li>
            <li> I would give it a 5 except I didn&#x27;t get the cleaning product with the sponge as advertised</li>
            <li> I love the sponge itself! I will never go back to any other brush/sponge. However, I HATE the liquid cleaner. It just doesn&#x27;t work well. They have a sold cleaner which is amazing! Buy that one instead!</li>
