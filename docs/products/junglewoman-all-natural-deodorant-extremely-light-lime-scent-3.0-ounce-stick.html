            <li>Not an attractive smell at all.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great idea, just doesn&#x27;t seem to do anything.</li>
            <li>but I love the concept great product</li>
            <li>I just wish they added a nicer smell to it, bc even though it&#x27;s better than BO, your pits will not smell that great.</li>
            <li>So I have tried sooo many &amp;#34;Natural Deodorants&amp;#34; to just end up like a sage bush, or smelling like a hippie!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Best natural deodorant I&#x27;ve found yet.</li>
            <li>Finally a healthy alternative to aluminum laden products.</li>
            <li>Kinda smells like baking soda more than lime, though thats better than overwhelming lime.</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much Jungleman Naturals for making a great natural product that works and smells great.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m use to making my own homemade deodorant and was looking for a quick replacer for when I don&#x27;t have time to make it.</li>
            <li>Should you have any questions in the future, please feel free to contact us and we&#x27;ll be more than happy to help you.</li>
            <li>It really eliminates body odor effectively.</li>
            <li>Fortunately, there is no smell to the product or under your arms.</li>
            <li>I used it for the first week and was fine.  </li>
            <li>So very pleased to find a natural deodorant that really works!</li>
            <li>The &amp;#34;lightly scented&amp;#34; versions still have basically no scent, and the natural scent of the product itself is really not the greatest.</li>
            <li>He spend all day working in a hot shop &amp; then went straight to cross fit, and he had no smell at all after his workout, which is amazing!</li>
            <li>This is hands down the best natural deodorant.</li>
            <li>This works better than any natural deodorant I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>Homemade is far superior, even the extremely simple coconut and baking soda ones.</li>
            <li>So I use this product most of the time, but if I really need wetness protection will use traditional deodorant/anti-perspirant.</li>
            <li>The original did irritate me but working with vendor I discovered I could use the other products like light scent, etc.  </li>
            <li>It really works.</li>
            <li>went to gentle yoga for 1 hour and came home</li>
            <li>For years, I have been very self conscientious about my underarm smell</li>
            <li>This is the first all natural deodorant that has worked for me.</li>
            <li>I was pretty sad because this product glides on really well and smelled nice at first</li>
            <li>You still sweat (as there are no crazy chemicals that clogg your pores) but you don&#x27;t smell and your shirts don&#x27;t turn yellow colors in the underarm area!</li>
            <li>I had so many of these in a span of a few months even after I stopped using the product.  </li>
            <li>This is the first one that actually WORKS!</li>
            <li>Wow, this was not it!</li>
            <li>but my skin is to sensitive.</li>
            <li>For a natural product, exceeded my expectations.</li>
            <li>I like the concept of just using natural deoderant.</li>
            <li>Its natural and keeps the stink away.</li>
            <li>(I haven&#x27;t found a natural anti-perspirant because it&#x27;s my understanding that the yucky ingredients are what stops the wetness.)</li>
            <li>The other product I have been using keeps me smell free ALL DAY long, so this product will go in the trash.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m getting really pissed paying shipping for every single piece even if I buy 4 at a time.</li>
            <li>But at least it doesn&#x27;t smell and that is huge.</li>
            <li>A Few weeks later I started getting huge abscesses in my armpits that required my Dr to open them to let it drain.  </li>
            <li>Only natural deodorant that works</li>
            <li>I have been using a different all natural product for 2 weeks now, and decided to give this one a try this morning because I bought 3 brands at once and hadn&#x27;t tried it yet.</li>
            <li>My skin got raw, super red, and weepy.  </li>
            <li>I truly waited until I knew I could provide a honest assessment because this is such a sensitive and important subject to those of us who hate our underarm smell.  </li>
            <li>The only slight problem: the product is not very well absorbed (I suppose it&#x27;s the baking soda) and I end to spread it with my fingers.</li>

            <li> pretty cool don&#x27;t smell bad with this, no rash.  </li>
            <li> It came sealed with a reflective cover and dry ice to keep it from melting.  </li>

            <li> it turned black</li>
            <li> And I&#x27;ve tried a lot of natural deodorants: all the others gave no, or very poor, protection against odors.</li>
            <li> The abscesses were so large and painful.  </li>
            <li> So hard it won&#x27;t run on arm, has no smell once so ever, and does nothing for perspiration.</li>
            <li> and I have hated the dark stains on my clothes from sweating out aluminum and other impurities from my body.  </li>
            <li> So sad.</li>
            <li> It irritated my armpits :(</li>
            <li> and I already smelled of BO :-(</li>

            <li> It irritated my armpits :( it turned black I had to stop using it but I love the concept great product but my skin is to sensitive.</li>
            <li> The only one that works for me. Meaning no smell, at all!, even after physical activity. And I&#x27;ve tried a lot of natural deodorants: all the others gave no, or very poor, protection against odors. The only slight problem: the product is not very well absorbed (I suppose it&#x27;s the baking soda) and I end to spread it with my fingers. But hey, as it works soo well, I don&#x27;t make a fuss out of it.</li>
            <li> pretty cool don&#x27;t smell bad with this, no rash.  It came sealed with a reflective cover and dry ice to keep it from melting.  Extreme dedication to the product by the makers!</li>
            <li> So very pleased to find a natural deodorant that really works! Finally a healthy alternative to aluminum laden products. This product earned a place in our home from here on. Thank you!</li>
            <li> They are now using organic corn starch. Just got this email from the company:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great news.  As promised, we have begun using 100% organic corn starch (which is 100% non-GMO by default) in our products.  Our product information pages and FAQ have been updated accordingly to reflect that.  Should you have any questions in the future, please feel free to contact us and we&#x27;ll be more than happy to help you.</li>
            <li> Best natural deodorant I&#x27;ve found yet. It really works.</li>
            <li> So I have tried sooo many &amp;#34;Natural Deodorants&amp;#34; to just end up like a sage bush, or smelling like a hippie! Not an attractive smell at all.This is the first one that actually WORKS! It works even for my husband. He spend all day working in a hot shop &amp; then went straight to cross fit, and he had no smell at all after his workout, which is amazing! I&#x27;ve been telling all my friends about this product. I wish I could find it in the store so i didn&#x27;t have to pay for shipping. Thank you so much Jungleman Naturals for making a great natural product that works and smells great.</li>
            <li> This is the first all natural deodorant that has worked for me. I have been using it for over a year now, and I am sold on this stuff. I don&#x27;t get sticky or start smelling. If I am out in the extreme heat, I have had to reapply.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for a year now. It&#x27;s awesome! You still sweat (as there are no crazy chemicals that clogg your pores) but you don&#x27;t smell and your shirts don&#x27;t turn yellow colors in the underarm area! For a natural product, exceeded my expectations. I&#x27;m now a regular. Just wish they would get on Amazon Prime. I&#x27;m getting really pissed paying shipping for every single piece even if I buy 4 at a time. This will get more annoying soon.</li>
            <li> Love this deodorant!!!! Works great, even when I do Insanity!!!</li>
            <li> Kinda smells like baking soda more than lime, though thats better than overwhelming lime.</li>
            <li> Only natural deodorant that works and I have tried every one out there. Jungleman is the best!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally have such sensitive skin and used a ton of different deoderants in the past.  I wanted to give up antiperspirants because I got a ton of blackheads in my axillary region.  I initially gave this product five stars.  I used it for the first week and was fine.  I didn&#x27;t stink despite sweating a lot.  A Few weeks later I started getting huge abscesses in my armpits that required my Dr to open them to let it drain.  I had so many of these in a span of a few months even after I stopped using the product.  The abscesses were so large and painful.  My skin got raw, super red, and weepy.  I like the concept of just using natural deoderant. This product just wasn&#x27;t the one for me.  Nowadays I use Tom&#x27;s deoderant with a lavender scent and haven&#x27;t had a single problem.</li>
            <li> This works better than any natural deodorant I&#x27;ve tried. And I&#x27;ve tried a lot. It really eliminates body odor effectively. The &amp;#34;lightly scented&amp;#34; versions still have basically no scent, and the natural scent of the product itself is really not the greatest. I just wish they added a nicer smell to it, bc even though it&#x27;s better than BO, your pits will not smell that great.</li>
            <li> Love it! Works as described. Its definitely a daily application but that&#x27;s ok. Its natural and keeps the stink away.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m use to making my own homemade deodorant and was looking for a quick replacer for when I don&#x27;t have time to make it. Wow, this was not it! So hard it won&#x27;t run on arm, has no smell once so ever, and does nothing for perspiration. Homemade is far superior, even the extremely simple coconut and baking soda ones. It&#x27;s a great idea, just doesn&#x27;t seem to do anything.</li>
            <li> I have been using a different all natural product for 2 weeks now, and decided to give this one a try this morning because I bought 3 brands at once and hadn&#x27;t tried it yet. I showered, applied this deodorant, went to gentle yoga for 1 hour and came home and I already smelled of BO :-( ... I was pretty sad because this product glides on really well and smelled nice at first but it did nothing at all for my body odor. The other product I have been using keeps me smell free ALL DAY long, so this product will go in the trash. So sad.</li>
            <li> This is hands down the best natural deodorant. I&#x27;ve tried several and they just don&#x27;t work on odor. This brand does. I wish it had a different name, because I do not want to smell like a &amp;#34;jungle woman&amp;#34; and the name is a deterrent. Fortunately, there is no smell to the product or under your arms. Note that this is not an anti-perspirant and you will still sweat. But at least it doesn&#x27;t smell and that is huge. (I haven&#x27;t found a natural anti-perspirant because it&#x27;s my understanding that the yucky ingredients are what stops the wetness.) So I use this product most of the time, but if I really need wetness protection will use traditional deodorant/anti-perspirant.</li>
            <li> For years, I have been very self conscientious about my underarm smell and I have hated the dark stains on my clothes from sweating out aluminum and other impurities from my body.  I know I have weird smell because my PH is off so much, but I have finally found a deodorant that works.  The original did irritate me but working with vendor I discovered I could use the other products like light scent, etc.  I truly waited until I knew I could provide a honest assessment because this is such a sensitive and important subject to those of us who hate our underarm smell.  If you have not tried it, please do.  If you have issues, they have a great customer service and will try their best to assist you</li>
