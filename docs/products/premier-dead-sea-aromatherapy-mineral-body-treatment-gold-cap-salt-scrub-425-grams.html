            <li>It was easy for me to re-order this item for my best special friend (wife) word</li>
            <li>and it is easy to use, and has  a good feeling even after one application</li>
            <li>/&gt;Not as nice as they could be, but so much better than they were.</li>
            <li>Wonderful product, lovely smell, great price since other sites sell it almost twice the price.</li>
            <li>The salt scrub is treated with minerals and a moisturizer, but it&#x27;s very light and non-fragrant, and unobtrusive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So we bought two more on Amazon</li>
            <li>short, a wonderful product we happened into by chance at the store!  </li>

            <li>My daughter and I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVE this stuff.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I shopped around and found it here on Amazon--much cheaper than the mall kiosk.</li>
            <li>and OMG I am glad I did.</li>
            <li>Now I have my family hooked and will be ordering more.</li>
            <li>My body feels better every time I use it.</li>
            <li>I was happy to found this on Amazon for a very affordable price.</li>
            <li>Another satisfied customer</li>
            <li>Purcahsed as a gift for a friend since I have one and love it.</li>
            <li>Good product, doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all (and I have very sensitive skin to a lot of body washes and lotions).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Fantastic stuff.</li>
            <li>Hands are sooooooo smooth.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hand smooth &amp; tender.  </li>
            <li>This salt is fantastic scrub treatment.</li>
            <li>The salts leave your skin refreshed and so smooth.</li>
            <li>This Dead Sea salt is the best thing I&#x27;ve ever used for my skin...</li>
            <li>Ive heard its fantastic on psoriosis</li>
            <li>and the savings are fantastic.</li>
            <li>The first time I bought it at a kiosk in the mall, which cost me a lot more than what Amazon sells it for.  </li>
            <li>and you definatly feel clean and moisturised after using it</li>
            <li>/&gt;You will notice a huge difference on the first try!  </li>
            <li>Exfoliation every day instead of a spa treatment from time to time really works better.</li>
            <li>Skin stays so smooth and fresh.</li>
            <li>it gives me soft skin and smells nice too.</li>
            <li>product smells nice ,leave ur skin soft and moist as if u just got a pedicure.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t believe use lower price can get good deals in the future.</li>
            <li>I have used other salts scrubs but not as great as this product.</li>
            <li>EXACT product with a much more reasonable price tag.</li>
            <li>This salt scrub is worth every penny and there is no substitute.  </li>
            <li>I use it right before bed and a bit throughout the day and my hands stay wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>do not use right after shaving.  </li>
            <li>I start using the salt scrub right away</li>
            <li>The texture is just right.  </li>
            <li>Product arrived way ahead of time which was a plus, and the price is very reasonable</li>
            <li>salt scrub undoes so much damage!  </li>
            <li>My sister gave me my first jar.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Shipping was very expedient and arrived before the estimated time!</li>
            <li>I first bought it at the mall</li>
            <li>i will be buying 3 more next time i order!</li>
            <li>It is very hot where I live</li>
            <li>I recommend this product very highly and enthusiastically.  </li>
            <li>It does a great job in removing the dead skin cells and rejuvenating my entire hand.  </li>
            <li>Having been using Premier products for about 16 months and it has really made a difference for me.  </li>
            <li>combined with the body butter - I prefer the herbal - this really works ...</li>
            <li>She really tried to give me the deal of a lifetime</li>
            <li>They gave me suggestions and creams but nothing really helped or relieved it.  </li>
            <li>We have used this scrub for years and paid as much as $30 a jar.  </li>
            <li>I used a pumice stone first followed by using the mineral body treatment on my feet, the majority of the dead skin on my feet went away leaving my feet nice and soft.</li>
            <li>I use it 2-3 times per day and after several weeks it&#x27;s still more than half full.</li>
            <li>We love this scrub so much, we keep a few bottles on hand as stock.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>A product like this usually costs quite a bit more at retail stores (3-4 times as much).  </li>
            <li>The other oils leave my skin so smooth.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;re rubbing salt on newly exfoliated skin.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s going to burn, at least it did for me, but other than that it works great.  </li>
            <li>This salt scrub completely cured the problem!  </li>
            <li>I was surprised!</li>
            <li>Always leaves my skin feeling new and soft BUT just a warning...</li>
            <li>I have now been clear for 5 years.  </li>
            <li>People think I&#x27;m younger than I really am.</li>
            <li>and I was amazed how soft my hands were after just using it one time.</li>
            <li>I could tell the difference in how soft my skin felt.....</li>
            <li>I love the essential oils in Premier Dead Sea&#x27;s Salt Scrub.</li>
            <li>We have used up one container we bought at a mall during the Holidays a few years back and were glad to find it on-line.</li>
            <li>It worked WONDERS for smoothing out the dry, scratchy, cracked &amp; peeling elbow and heel areas, on the FIRST TREATMENT.  </li>
            <li>I use it once a week  and no more dry feet:)</li>
            <li>His hands felt soft after one use only.</li>
            <li>The company offers a full guarantee on it as well, at least the salesman at the retail kiosk told me that, but that may apply only by dealer...</li>
            <li>, he was the only one without major blisters or heel problems.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> , he was the only one without major blisters or heel problems.</li>
            <li> The jar is big and will last a long time.</li>
            <li> I had been inquiring about this product several months due to going to various malls and then I finally stopped and let the lady do a test on one hand.</li>
            <li> They would get extremely itchy and red with tiny raised bumps.  </li>
            <li> As long as I do that, no problems come up.  </li>
            <li> I have diabetes and get dry feet a lot.</li>
            <li> The only downside is that the oils were a bit dried up I guess from being in storage too long.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin and use this a couple times a week.</li>
            <li> But they are selling it for a ridiculous high price.</li>
            <li> I use it on my feet to smooth out the rough dry skin and on my upper arms to minimize those annoying red patchy blotches that appear between the elbow and shoulder.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend using it only once a week for your body, but maybe 2 to 3 times a week for harder areas like the heels or soles of your feet, and those hard areas around the big toe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Exactly as expected  Exactly as expected Exactly as expected</li>
            <li> I was really skeptical at first, but I already knew the healing properties of the Dead Sea and mud bath</li>
            <li> A little pricey though.</li>
            <li> The only negative I can think of is it&#x27;s a little hard getting out of jar without it going all over the place.</li>
            <li> After using this I use the Premier Dead Sea Body Butter on my hands and they make my hands softer than anything I have ever used.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> scrub away dead skin  </li>
            <li> but I have a lot of dead skin on my feet.</li>
            <li> She said it takes literally all the dead skin off and leaves her feeling like a baby.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only recently begun to have mercy on them and started wearing gloves for the really bad stuff.  </li>
            <li> I try to remember to use it now at least once a week.  </li>
            <li> The sent is weak and doesn&#x27;t work as well</li>
            <li> so unfortunately I lost some of the oil.</li>
            <li> and it was expensive.  </li>
            <li> and I had to start wearing long sleeves all of the time because my arms looked horrible.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m horrible to my hands.</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;m still terrible about the gloves when doing dishes and using milder cleansers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It was miserable and embarrassing.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> Was introduced to this product line at the mall.  It leaves my hand smooth &amp; tender.  The price at Amazon makes it affordable.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product! My mother purchased THE SAME THING at the mall, for THREE TIMES the cost! We will both be purchasing it from this seller from now on. It is a must-have in both our homes!</li>
            <li> I was really skeptical at first, but I already knew the healing properties of the Dead Sea and mud bath so we picked up a bottle at a local kiosk and gave it a go.  It worked WONDERS for smoothing out the dry, scratchy, cracked &amp; peeling elbow and heel areas, on the FIRST TREATMENT.  The salt scrub is treated with minerals and a moisturizer, but it&#x27;s very light and non-fragrant, and unobtrusive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great value for the money; if you visit the Premier kiosk in a retail store or mall, you will easily be paying twice what you will be getting it on here, even including shipping!  So we bought two more on Amazon, it was almost like buying ONE at the retail kiosk!  Almost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You will notice a huge difference on the first try!  I would recommend using it only once a week for your body, but maybe 2 to 3 times a week for harder areas like the heels or soles of your feet, and those hard areas around the big toe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would also use this in conjunction with the Premier body butter; the salt scrub opens up the pores, the body butter provides extra moisturization and closes the pores.  See my review of the body butter!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short, a wonderful product we happened into by chance at the store!  I recommend this product very highly and enthusiastically.  The company offers a full guarantee on it as well, at least the salesman at the retail kiosk told me that, but that may apply only by dealer...?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know if there is anything scientific to this, so this is kind of an \\&quot;aside,\\&quot; but I had convinced my husband to try it regularly, and he said during his Army 30 mile pack march, he was the only one without major blisters or heel problems.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for quite some time now. My skin looks great. People think I&#x27;m younger than I really am. Exfoliation every day instead of a spa treatment from time to time really works better.</li>
            <li> I am on my fourth jar of this mineral body treatment! The first time I bought it at a kiosk in the mall, which cost me a lot more than what Amazon sells it for.  I love this because it works better at softening my hands.  After using this I use the Premier Dead Sea Body Butter on my hands and they make my hands softer than anything I have ever used.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This salt is fantastic scrub treatment. I have used this product for four years and I am very satisfied with result after using. Skin stays so smooth and fresh.</li>
            <li> I really love the Premier group of beauty products and so does my daughter.  The salts leave your skin refreshed and so smooth.</li>
            <li> I love the essential oils in Premier Dead Sea&#x27;s Salt Scrub. The other oils leave my skin so smooth.Wonderful scent. Increases circulation. Soothing.</li>
            <li> My daughter and I love this stuff.  I&#x27;m horrible to my hands. I&#x27;ve only recently begun to have mercy on them and started wearing gloves for the really bad stuff.  But I&#x27;m still terrible about the gloves when doing dishes and using milder cleansers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This salt scrub undoes so much damage!  I use it right before bed and a bit throughout the day and my hands stay wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not as nice as they could be, but so much better than they were.</li>
            <li> This Dead Sea salt is the best thing I&#x27;ve ever used for my skin...I would recommend this to anyone. I love it!</li>
            <li> Having been using Premier products for about 16 months and it has really made a difference for me.  The salt scrub is amazing.</li>
            <li> This is a great product,however the lid wasnt stickytaped so it leaked during transit so unfortunately I lost some of the oil. However Ive used it before this and its great for your skin. Ive heard its fantastic on psoriosis and you definatly feel clean and moisturised after using it</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this stuff.  Always leaves my skin feeling new and soft BUT just a warning... do not use right after shaving.  Think about it.  You&#x27;re rubbing salt on newly exfoliated skin.  It&#x27;s going to burn, at least it did for me, but other than that it works great.  This is the 6th time I&#x27;ve bought this stuff and I&#x27;ll continue to buy!</li>
            <li> I learned of this product when a friend purchased it from a kiosk at a shopping mall for twice the price.  The salt actually gets &amp;#34;oily&amp;#34; as you rub it on your skin. I use it on my feet to smooth out the rough dry skin and on my upper arms to minimize those annoying red patchy blotches that appear between the elbow and shoulder.  Certainly better prized on Amazon than in a shopping mall!</li>
            <li> This is my 2nd time ordering this. My sister gave me my first jar. I have very dry skin and use this a couple times a week. it gives me soft skin and smells nice too. I still need lotion after,but for a scrub it is wonderful.</li>
            <li> We have used up one container we bought at a mall during the Holidays a few years back and were glad to find it on-line. The product is wonderful.</li>
            <li> I have diabetes and get dry feet a lot. I have used other salts scrubs but not as great as this product. I use it once a week  and no more dry feet:) .the product smells nice ,leave ur skin soft and moist as if u just got a pedicure. Just b cafeful if ur standing in the shower and doing ur feet with any scrubs.</li>
            <li> Good scrub. No irritation whatsoever ever.</li>
            <li> combined with the body butter - I prefer the herbal - this really works ...</li>
            <li> Great product for exfoliating and softening your hands.  A little pricey though.</li>
            <li> Good product, doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all (and I have very sensitive skin to a lot of body washes and lotions).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was very expedient and arrived before the estimated time!</li>
            <li> Very satisfied with my purchase. The scrub works great and I was amazed how soft my hands were after just using it one time. I&#x27;m so glad I shopped around and found it here on Amazon--much cheaper than the mall kiosk. The jar is big and will last a long time. The only negative I can think of is it&#x27;s a little hard getting out of jar without it going all over the place.</li>
            <li> Finally I can purchase this salt online and not from a visit to the local mall. This product has always done great for us, and not just this one but any we have tried from this company.</li>
            <li> I decided to check online and OMG I am glad I did. EXACT product with a much more reasonable price tag. I had been inquiring about this product several months due to going to various malls and then I finally stopped and let the lady do a test on one hand. HMMMM. I could tell the difference in how soft my skin felt..... BUT I still was not sold on it.  She really tried to give me the deal of a lifetime and I just could not see spending the amount of money she was asking. Now I have my family hooked and will be ordering more.</li>
            <li> For years, I don&#x27;t know if it was psoriasis but I had some kind of a skin condition on my arms.  They would get extremely itchy and red with tiny raised bumps.  When I would scratch my arms, the bumps would bleed.  I had been to several doctors and the dermatologist.  They gave me suggestions and creams but nothing really helped or relieved it.  It was miserable and embarrassing.  It is very hot where I live and I had to start wearing long sleeves all of the time because my arms looked horrible.  This salt scrub completely cured the problem!  I have now been clear for 5 years.  Once in a while, one of my arms will start to get red and a bit itchy.  I start using the salt scrub right away and it stops it.  I try to remember to use it now at least once a week.  As long as I do that, no problems come up.  I have no idea what is in the product that helped but I am so grateful I found it.  I first bought it at the mall and it was expensive.  I now buy it online and the savings are fantastic.</li>
            <li> scrub away dead skin  so you look smoother  and it is easy to use, and has  a good feeling even after one application</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a fake.it&#x27;s different with the ture primier product.I don&#x27;t believe use lower price can get good deals in the future.</li>
            <li> I have brought this product before in the mall.  The quality is not the same. The sent is weak and doesn&#x27;t work as well but it does the job.</li>
            <li> You can feel that the salt is helping your body.  The texture is just right.  It is effective.  My body feels better every time I use it.</li>
            <li> I was introduced to this product in a shopping mall. My boyfriend who works in construction tried it and was amazed by the results. His hands felt soft after one use only. But they are selling it for a ridiculous high price. I was happy to found this on Amazon for a very affordable price.</li>
            <li> It works wonders---great product</li>
            <li> I have psoriasis on the palms of my hand, so I use this before applying topical cortico-steroids.  It does a great job in removing the dead skin cells and rejuvenating my entire hand.  My palms have improved remarkably. The price is absolutely wonderful as well.  A product like this usually costs quite a bit more at retail stores (3-4 times as much).  The quality is excellent and it lasts.  I use it 2-3 times per day and after several weeks it&#x27;s still more than half full.</li>
            <li> I received this product yesterday and used it this morning on my feet. I&#x27;m not the type of guy who goes out and gets pedicures all the time but I have a lot of dead skin on my feet. I used a pumice stone first followed by using the mineral body treatment on my feet, the majority of the dead skin on my feet went away leaving my feet nice and soft. I was surprised! Great product! Will buy a lot in the future!</li>
            <li> We have used this scrub for years and paid as much as $30 a jar.  This salt scrub is worth every penny and there is no substitute.  We love this scrub so much, we keep a few bottles on hand as stock.  The smell is awesome.  We use it on hands and feet, especially during the winter when our gas heat dries everything out.</li>
            <li> My mom loves this stuff and it&#x27;s all she asks for at every birthday and Christmas and in between.  She said it takes literally all the dead skin off and leaves her feeling like a baby.</li>
            <li> It leaves your body very smooth i been using this product for 3 years now #1 product for exfoliating! Product arrived way ahead of time which was a plus, and the price is very reasonable i will be buying 3 more next time i order! Another satisfied customer</li>
            <li> Wonderful product, lovely smell, great price since other sites sell it almost twice the price. The only downside is that the oils were a bit dried up I guess from being in storage too long.</li>
            <li> It was easy for me to re-order this item for my best special friend (wife) word 1-5 Exactly as expected  Exactly as expected Exactly as expected</li>
            <li> Purcahsed as a gift for a friend since I have one and love it. Receieved good reviews from her. Highly recommend.</li>
