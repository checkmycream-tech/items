    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Bundle of shower caps, perfect for my purpose - covering dough as it proofs.  </li>
            <li>Rising bread is another excellent use.</li>
            <li>/&gt;They&#x27;re especially nice when traveling with food, because the elastic band gives me 100% confidence the food will stay covered.</li>
            <li>and they work perfectly.</li>
            <li>Excellent price for shower caps.</li>
            <li>Great value for money as I use them to steam my hair</li>
            <li>For that, they&#x27;re great.  </li>
            <li>Great value.</li>
            <li>good for the price and bulk.</li>
            <li>Lasted me a while and worked good.</li>
            <li>A good stand by shower cap to have.</li>
            <li>I purchased these to use as bowl covers and find them quite handy.</li>
            <li>Nice hotel style shower caps, nothing fancy but does the job.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re very easy to store.</li>
            <li>Nice and easy.</li>
            <li>These are just more sanitary</li>
            <li>If you have shoulder length hair, then you might be able to squeeze your hair</li>
            <li>These are excellent items, but I did not realize they come individually wrapped.  </li>
            <li>Where do the hotels get their shower caps - they are much better.</li>
            <li>Came in very quick.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>Very satisfied with product and fast delivery.</li>
            <li>They were fine.</li>
            <li>But I suspect that if your head is large, they will fit nicely too  </li>
            <li>They fit all but my widest bowls.</li>
            <li>She likes them because they are light and don&#x27;t flatten your hair.</li>
            <li>I wear a pony tail and the cap covers the hair very well, absolutely better than most hotel products.</li>
            <li>I thought that these came in their own separate boxes but none the less they are of good quality and I like them</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s ok, I suppose, but I would rather not have to throw away so much packaging.  </li>
            <li>and they&#x27;re very large so they&#x27;ll fit all heads/hairstyles.</li>
            <li>and the price is right.</li>
            <li>I think then reusing higher grader caps.</li>
            <li>A package of 100 is cheap, and 100 will last a couple of years.</li>
            <li>I really like to bring one out when I&#x27;m covering a bowl or dish that I know</li>
            <li>I absolutely recommend.</li>
            <li>Spend the money and buy some decent ones.  </li>
            <li>They look really flimsy, but I was surprised at how much stretch is in the elastic band.</li>
            <li>Still, the items are as described and I have to rate it highly because they work well</li>
            <li>cheap plastic bags that u can put on your head while you shower or when u are doing a hair treatment but have other things to do while u soak.</li>
            <li>Stacked on top of each other, it might take 4-5 of them to equal a piece of Almond Roca, or Almond Joy/Mounds candy.</li>
            <li>So far, using about 5-6 of them, none have come apart.</li>
            <li>The elastic band is snug around the face and my head, though full of smarts and knowledge is probably of average size.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great price for a large quantity, but I&#x27;d prefer a few less, and slightly thicker plastic.</li>
            <li>So small they would barely fit a child&#x27;s head and then fall apart before your shower is complete!</li>
            <li>Usually use them about 3/4 times and then discard which works fine for me.</li>
            <li>They fit smaller and larger bowls, and I don&#x27;t have to sort through all the lids my wife has scattered around in order to find the one specific lid for the one specific bowl I&#x27;m using.  </li>
            <li>It gets the general job done.</li>

            <li> They tear if you aren&#x27;t careful when you unroll them.  </li>

            <li> a storage point of view, these come in a plastic bag, with each cap shrunk down very small.</li>
            <li> Too small, and flimsy.</li>
            <li> Very thin but sturdy enough to use twice a day for a month with shoulder-length hair.</li>
            <li> What a waste!!  </li>

            <li> Bundle of shower caps, perfect for my purpose - covering dough as it proofs.  Inexpensive.</li>
            <li> Very thin but sturdy enough to use twice a day for a month with shoulder-length hair. Who needs an expensive shower cap when you can get 100 of these for the same or less cost!</li>
            <li> Great value for money as I use them to steam my hair and they get the job done. Usually use them about 3/4 times and then discard which works fine for me.</li>
            <li> Some of the caps broke when opened to put on my head</li>
            <li> Anyone that would score this item low has really impossible standards! These are just plastic shower caps...the elastic is snug and will not let any water in and they&#x27;re very large so they&#x27;ll fit all heads/hairstyles. These are just more sanitary I think then reusing higher grader caps. For 8 bucks or so for 100 you&#x27;ll have enough for months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TIP: I use these to store my handbags in. Prevents dust, scratches, etc and you can just pop them on and off.</li>
            <li> Just a warning for those who wish to purchase these shower caps,  THEY ARE REALLY TINY. I have collarbone length hair and when I tried to stuff my hair inside these CAPS to condition it, some of my hair came out and my hairline was visible. If you have really long hair, DO NOT BUY THESE. I can guarantee that your hair will not fit inTO these tiny caps. If you have shoulder length hair, then you might be able to squeeze your hair inside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to use them until I run out since I have a hundred of them now!</li>
            <li> These are excellent items, but I did not realize they come individually wrapped.  That&#x27;s ok, I suppose, but I would rather not have to throw away so much packaging.  Still, the items are as described and I have to rate it highly because they work well and the price is right.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use these as shower caps, I use them as lids to cover bowls in the fridge.  For that, they&#x27;re great.  They fit smaller and larger bowls, and I don&#x27;t have to sort through all the lids my wife has scattered around in order to find the one specific lid for the one specific bowl I&#x27;m using.  It doesn&#x27;t create an air-tight seal, but for lettuce or leftover pasta (for example), you can&#x27;t beat &#x27;em.  They&#x27;re thin and will eventually tear, but then I throw it away and use another.  A package of 100 is cheap, and 100 will last a couple of years.</li>
            <li> waste of money. came and looked like little catipillars. Poor quality and too small- made for a two year old not an adult</li>
            <li> Spend the money and buy some decent ones.  So small they would barely fit a child&#x27;s head and then fall apart before your shower is complete!</li>

            <li> cheap plastic bags that u can put on your head while you shower or when u are doing a hair treatment but have other things to do while u soak. good for the price and bulk.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied with product and fast delivery.</li>
            <li> I purchased these to use as bowl covers and find them quite handy. They fit all but my widest bowls. I really like to bring one out when I&#x27;m covering a bowl or dish that I know is going to be repeatedly covered and uncovered, like the brownies I bake in my 9 x 9 stoneware dish. Rising bread is another excellent use. So far, using about 5-6 of them, none have come apart. They look really flimsy, but I was surprised at how much stretch is in the elastic band. None have broken yet, and I&#x27;ve covered some bowls that I thought &amp;#34;No way&amp;#34;. Way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They&#x27;re especially nice when traveling with food, because the elastic band gives me 100% confidence the food will stay covered. If you&#x27;ve ever opened your trunk to find the cover has come off your pie, you&#x27;ll know what I mean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From a storage point of view, these come in a plastic bag, with each cap shrunk down very small. Stacked on top of each other, it might take 4-5 of them to equal a piece of Almond Roca, or Almond Joy/Mounds candy. They&#x27;re very easy to store.</li>
            <li> Nice hotel style shower caps, nothing fancy but does the job.</li>
            <li> Horrible caps… Wasn&#x27;t wait the time nor the money---  What a waste!!  EA</li>
            <li> I ordered this product because i wanted disposable bathing caps that could cover my entire head, well my hair anyway. I wear them a few times and then I toss them. I wear a pony tail and the cap covers the hair very well, absolutely better than most hotel products. The elastic band is snug around the face and my head, though full of smarts and knowledge is probably of average size. But I suspect that if your head is large, they will fit nicely too  It does the job. I ordered 100 of them. They are packed in groups of 10.  I received my order within a couple of days. Nice and easy. I absolutely recommend.</li>
            <li> I bought these for my girlfriend who loves the shower caps you get at hotels.  She likes them because they are light and don&#x27;t flatten your hair.</li>
            <li> Came in very quick. Easy to use.</li>
            <li> They were fine. Was not happy with the packaging .</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t be buying these again. Too small, and flimsy.</li>
            <li> Lasted me a while and worked good. A good stand by shower cap to have. It gets the general job done.</li>
            <li> I thought that these came in their own separate boxes but none the less they are of good quality and I like them</li>
            <li> Just what I needed.  May last for years!</li>
            <li> I bought these for when I do hair masks and they work perfectly. 100 of these babies for $4 is a total steal. Would purchase again.</li>
            <li> Excellent price for shower caps. I use these for hair treatments to contain any mess. Just what I was expecting.</li>
            <li> Dreadful quality, barely lasts one shower before disintegrating. Where do the hotels get their shower caps - they are much better.</li>
