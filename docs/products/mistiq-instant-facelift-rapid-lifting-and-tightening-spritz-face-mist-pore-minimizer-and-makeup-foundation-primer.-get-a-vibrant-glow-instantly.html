            <li>Protégé Pore Minimizer MISTIQ sounded like a good alternative.  </li>
            <li>- it goes on nicely and feels good under makeup.</li>
            <li>It smells great, is easy to use, and helps the texture/look of my skin.</li>
            <li>Fast face lift!!!!!</li>
            <li>Honestly ,in one word &amp;#34;MIRACLE&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>but honestly it seems to do nothing..</li>
            <li>and it does have a nice smell to it.  </li>
            <li>I feel like my skin is tighter but honestly can&#x27;t see a difference in the mirror..</li>
            <li>I did get this product with a discount/ promotion although my thoughts and opinions are always my own and unbiased.</li>
            <li>It applies very easily and medium coverage.</li>
            <li>This product is very easy to use</li>
            <li>It tightens my skin, and it&#x27;s so easy to use!</li>
            <li>Too good to be true...</li>
            <li>Smells and feels lovely</li>
            <li>Will try it one more time before pitching it out.</li>
            <li>I love that I can carry Mistiq with me where ever I go and and a spritz when i need it the most.</li>
            <li>Thanks for putting out a great product.</li>
            <li>so I wont buy this again for sure.</li>
            <li>i love it.</li>
            <li>after using, it seems like your skin became better and smother in a moment.</li>
            <li>like it because it does make my face feel more firmer</li>
            <li>did receive this product for free in exchange for an honest review.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love the smell.</li>
            <li>My skin looks vibrant and feels great.</li>
            <li>BUT..it does have the most soothing effect on the skin when applied..like a cool mist!</li>
            <li>The scent isn&#x27;t strong but light and refreshing.</li>
            <li>so it has a very light, clean, floral type scent.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s perfect to use in conjunction with other products/treatments .... to help conceal as you heal.</li>
            <li>The spray pump makes it easy to apply and the size is perfect to throw in my purse in case I need a little refreshing throughout the day.</li>
            <li>The formula doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all which is a huge plus.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t believe how well Mistiq actually worked and how great it worked under my make up.</li>
            <li>Its great to take me from afternoon to evening without feeling gross.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also great on the red splotches I have on my face.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also refreshing after a hot shower.</li>
            <li>so was quite excited to see how it would work.</li>
            <li>and I love the night cream by Protege so much</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised by the nice floral scent and</li>
            <li>how the spray felt cool on my skin.</li>
            <li>It quickly firms your skin without feeling sticky.</li>
            <li>One quick spray and you are done.</li>
            <li>I thought this was a really neat and cool thing!</li>
            <li>I love that the ingredients are natural!</li>
            <li>Would be tremendous during a hot flash flushing, or on a very hot day.</li>
            <li>Not only did I not see any notable difference, I felt like it wouldn&#x27;t be a good value; it takes about 3-4 sprays to cover your face and neck and it isn&#x27;t a very big container.</li>
            <li>But it was worth a try ....</li>
            <li>After using this product for a few days my face feels smoother and the skin has a nice healthy glow to my skin.</li>
            <li>Which it does say it is good for Rosacea but not certain that is what I have just know</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have huge pores although in certain spots they are more noticeable like on the sides of my nose and upper cheek areas.</li>
            <li>Would definitely recommend this to anyone who wants to look better!</li>
            <li>So far so good - tightening of the skin and pore visibility is low.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 48 and look about my age, I wasn&#x27;t expecting a transformation but SOMETHING truly noticeable would have been thrilling.</li>
            <li>I really like this product!</li>
            <li>The first thing I noticed about this product was the scent.</li>
            <li>Works pretty good for a quick tightening, but doesn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li>Holy cow does this stuff actually work and it looks awesome and natural.</li>
            <li>I find this spray does a good job at making those pores look smaller and my skin look overall smoother.</li>
            <li>I mean, it made my face look great but the real test was how did my make up look over this stuff.</li>
            <li>I tried it and it did absolutely nothing.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t know what it would really do</li>
            <li>It does absolutely nothing.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really notice any results.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like it but won&#x27;t return because to much of a hassle for me.</li>
            <li>I seem to use too much also</li>
            <li>but I really don&#x27;t like perfumy</li>
            <li>The small size means it fits easily in my purse and will fit in a TSA approved carryon bag for liquids when traveling as well.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin + Protege&#x27;s other products I&#x27;ve liked</li>
            <li>It completely reduced the size of my pores on my nose, which are usually very large.</li>
            <li>I found if I spray a small amount on my fingertips and pat it where I need it, it works better on those targeted areas without wasting the product!</li>
            <li>I like trying new things after all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have to say that I honestly didn&#x27;t think this stuff would work or it wouldn&#x27;t last as long, it would look strange, or that it would make me look plastic</li>
            <li>/&gt;Therefore, rather than a daily spritz,  I will use it only on special occasions.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m thinking that probably this tube should last me at least a month, maybe more!</li>
            <li>Younger skins will probably LOVE this little boost.</li>
            <li>I followed the direction completely</li>
            <li>It made my make up go on smoother than ever before and the real test was the fact it not only lasted all day but even all night until I washed my face.</li>
            <li>This is one product that I completely recommend and suggest it be a staple in every woman&#x27;s make up bag.</li>
            <li>really like to use this prior to putting my makeup to tighten my skin and shrink my pores a bit.</li>
            <li>I love this as a refresher in the late afternoon.</li>
            <li>I really like this Instant Face Lift</li>
            <li>Overall I really like this product.</li>
            <li>so sorry Protege, i just cannot give you a good review</li>
            <li>/&gt;It does have a very slight odor to it that is not bad smelling</li>
            <li>I rub it in real fast because it doesn&#x27;t take it long to dry at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>/&gt;Very tiny and sleek in size so it will fit in almost any small purse or carry on bag for overniters or whatever</li>
            <li>I admit that I am one of those people who things tend to not work for; things tend to do the opposite for me, so I wasn&#x27;t surprised.</li>
            <li>apparently it works, but it doesn&#x27;t</li>
            <li>Key word, natural.</li>
            <li>When I use it, my wrinkles (I&#x27;m older but don&#x27;t have many, and hardly any deep ones!) are less noticeable.</li>
            <li>I am sending it back, it may work for others but did nothing but make my face sticky and my make-up look even worse makes my wrinkles and pores show up even more.</li>
            <li>Its not working for my pores, and it gives a stink feeling when first apply to face, hurts a little.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I rub it in real fast because it doesn&#x27;t take it long to dry at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

            <li> apparently it works, but it doesn&#x27;t</li>
            <li> Key word, natural.</li>

            <li> Its not working for my pores, and it gives a stink feeling when first apply to face, hurts a little.</li>
            <li> I was just disappointed, again because I love the night cream by the company so much.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do a darn thing for me , perhaps my face has been drooping too long for anything to work .</li>
            <li> It does tighten, but it does dry my skin .  </li>
            <li> Had a very strong bad hairspray/cheap perfume scent.</li>
            <li> Also, literally within 2 minutes of spraying it on one half of my T-zone it started to turn red and irritated.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected from reading the reviews.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always on the lookout for the next thing to shave a few year off of my skin.  </li>
            <li> As soon as I received the MISTIQ spray, I did as the directions say, closed my eyes, tucked in my lips and sprayed away.  </li>
            <li> You do need to reapply this throughout the day but it does last for quite a few hours.</li>
            <li> But again it&#x27;s not really a strong enough odor and for the benefit of firming my skin</li>
            <li> I can see why other people would like this</li>
            <li> BUT my makeup seemed much more prone to oxidization when I wore underneath :-(</li>
            <li> I turned to other things to help give my skin a lift.  </li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> and it only takes a small spritz on each cheek.</li>
            <li> it is small red splotchy places.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is useless, doesn&#x27;t do a thing a real joke.</li>
            <li> and my jaws seem less jiggly.</li>
            <li> I can deal with the slight aroma!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Wish it lasted a little longer but does work well.</li>
            <li> I do feel that it made my skin a little tighter and brightened me up</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time or money.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no strong, overpowering aroma.  </li>
            <li> I am anxious to try it for a longer period of time.</li>
            <li> Which was definitely not refreshing.</li>

            <li> I have used fillers such as Botox along with Juvaderm and although the results are noticeable, the price and the bruising have made me shy</li>
            <li> basically you just spray a small amount of it on your face.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sad.</li>
            <li> And this company stands behind all of their products!</li>
            <li> This stuff was really expensive.  </li>
            <li> Of course, I&#x27;m always skeptical about a face lift in a bottle/jar/etc.  </li>
            <li> It wasn’t to the point where my face felt uncomfortable or anything.</li>
            <li> But this just didn&#x27;t work for me unfortunately.</li>
            <li> sorry to say i did not see one single result..i hate putting bad reviews for products, but i keep getting emails asking to rate this product...</li>
            <li> I was afraid this would make my skin appear shiny</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have been using this product for about a week and it has had minimal results so far. BUT..it does have the most soothing effect on the skin when applied..like a cool mist! Would be tremendous during a hot flash flushing, or on a very hot day. I am anxious to try it for a longer period of time.</li>
            <li> Smells and feels lovely but I notice nothing. I&#x27;m 48 and look about my age, I wasn&#x27;t expecting a transformation but SOMETHING truly noticeable would have been thrilling. I&#x27;m sad.</li>
            <li> Love!!!!! Fast face lift!!!!!🙌</li>
            <li> I can see why other people would like this and I love the night cream by Protege so much, I thought I would give this a try too. It was not for me. Not only did I not see any notable difference, I felt like it wouldn&#x27;t be a good value; it takes about 3-4 sprays to cover your face and neck and it isn&#x27;t a very big container. I didn&#x27;t feel any &amp;#34;tightening&amp;#34; and it didn&#x27;t seem to make a difference as a makeup primer. I admit that I am one of those people who things tend to not work for; things tend to do the opposite for me, so I wasn&#x27;t surprised. I was just disappointed, again because I love the night cream by the company so much.</li>
            <li> this product does not work for me.</li>
            <li> I really like this product! When I use it, my wrinkles (I&#x27;m older but don&#x27;t have many, and hardly any deep ones!) are less noticeable. I find the effect has lasted about 3 hours. And it also tightened my pores! I found if I spray a small amount on my fingertips and pat it where I need it, it works better on those targeted areas without wasting the product! I&#x27;m thinking that probably this tube should last me at least a month, maybe more! I love that the ingredients are natural! And this company stands behind all of their products! I&#x27;m very delighted with this product!</li>
            <li> I followed the direction completely this product did not work for the consistency felt like putting water on my face there was no change.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected from reading the reviews. Had a very strong bad hairspray/cheap perfume scent. Which was definitely not refreshing. And it irritated rather than soothed my skin. Will try it one more time before pitching it out.</li>
            <li> Honestly ,in one word &amp;#34;MIRACLE&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> What? I saw good reviews but honestly it seems to do nothing.. Think it&#x27;s in the head. Lol</li>
            <li> I tried it and it did absolutely nothing.  I returned it</li>
            <li> This product smells divine and does have a tightening effect BUT my makeup seemed much more prone to oxidization when I wore underneath :-(</li>
            <li> apparently it works, but it doesn&#x27;t</li>
            <li> TOO EXPENSIVE!!!  IT DOES NOT WORK ON ME....NO..NO INSTANT LIFT?</li>
            <li> I have to say that I honestly didn&#x27;t think this stuff would work or it wouldn&#x27;t last as long, it would look strange, or that it would make me look plastic like. I didn&#x27;t know what it would really do but I gave it a chance and tried this stuff. Holy cow does this stuff actually work and it looks awesome and natural. Key word, natural. I used it just like the instructions said and it smoothed out the small lines at the corner of my eyes and under the eyes. It completely reduced the size of my pores on my nose, which are usually very large. I mean, it made my face look great but the real test was how did my make up look over this stuff. Well, it looked wonderful. It made my make up go on smoother than ever before and the real test was the fact it not only lasted all day but even all night until I washed my face. I couldn&#x27;t believe how well Mistiq actually worked and how great it worked under my make up. This is one product that I completely recommend and suggest it be a staple in every woman&#x27;s make up bag.</li>
            <li> I love that I can carry Mistiq with me where ever I go and and a spritz when i need it the most. A touch of moisture and lift. It quickly firms your skin without feeling sticky. One quick spray and you are done. No better way to get a face lift in seconds</li>
            <li> This is a one-of-a-kind product...  Tightens and lifts - Botox like effects in a spray.  I use it on wrinkles, crows feet, frown lines, and forehead ... Wherever I need a lifting or tightening effect.  I spray on my fingers then apply - before my moisturizer in the mornings, then throughout the day as needed (it&#x27;s found a permanent home in my purse). It&#x27;s perfect to use in conjunction with other products/treatments .... to help conceal as you heal.</li>
            <li> Only after a week of use I definately notice that my pores look non existent. My skin looks vibrant and feels great.</li>
            <li> sorry to say i did not see one single result..i hate putting bad reviews for products, but i keep getting emails asking to rate this product...so sorry Protege, i just cannot give you a good review</li>
            <li> It does absolutely nothing.  No tightening at all.  All of the reviews were so great.  I&#x27;m so disappointed.  This stuff was really expensive.  I can&#x27;t believe it does nothing for me at all.</li>
            <li> At 68 years of age, what once was all up is because of the passage of time, falling!  I have used fillers such as Botox along with Juvaderm and although the results are noticeable, the price and the bruising have made me shy away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I turned to other things to help give my skin a lift.  In fact, my biggest concern is the loss of elasticity rather than wrinkled skin.  Protégé Pore Minimizer MISTIQ sounded like a good alternative.  It does tighten, but it does dry my skin .  And there is a warning to that effect on the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Therefore, rather than a daily spritz,  I will use it only on special occasions.  Younger skins will probably LOVE this little boost.</li>
            <li> So far so good - tightening of the skin and pore visibility is low.  Thanks for putting out a great product.</li>
            <li> I like this spray and will recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> This is not Alvin Childs. I&#x27;m his wife and the person who ordered this product. I didn&#x27;t really notice any results.</li>
            <li> Works well.  Wish it lasted a little longer but does work well.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice anything different from using it except it dries out my skin. I don&#x27;t like it but won&#x27;t return because to much of a hassle for me.</li>
            <li> Another gem from Prot&amp;eacute;g&amp;eacute; Beauty.  I&#x27;m always on the lookout for the next thing to shave a few year off of my skin.  Of course, I&#x27;m always skeptical about a face lift in a bottle/jar/etc.  As soon as I received the MISTIQ spray, I did as the directions say, closed my eyes, tucked in my lips and sprayed away.  I was pleasantly surprised by the nice floral scent and how the spray felt cool on my skin. I do feel that it made my skin a little tighter and brightened me up a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like to use this prior to putting my makeup to tighten my skin and shrink my pores a bit. It&#x27;s also refreshing after a hot shower.</li>
            <li> Its not working for my pores, and it gives a stink feeling when first apply to face, hurts a little. so I wont buy this again for sure.</li>
            <li> I can feel the difference almost Immediately! It tightens my skin, and it&#x27;s so easy to use! Just spray and go!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t do anything for tightening the skin.  I gave it two stars because it doesn&#x27;t irritate the skin and it does have a nice smell to it.  Other than that though, I have not been impressed.</li>
            <li> Great stuff, love how it makes my make up look and makes my face feel tighter! Would definitely recommend this to anyone who wants to look better!</li>
            <li> I am sending it back, it may work for others but did nothing but make my face sticky and my make-up look even worse makes my wrinkles and pores show up even more. This product is not for me.</li>
            <li> I feel like my skin is tighter but honestly can&#x27;t see a difference in the mirror..I seem to use too much also so maybe is the user not the product...</li>
            <li> Very nice spritz. i love it. after using, it seems like your skin became better and smother in a moment.</li>
            <li> I love this as a refresher in the late afternoon. Its great to take me from afternoon to evening without feeling gross. The small size means it fits easily in my purse and will fit in a TSA approved carryon bag for liquids when traveling as well. Great product.</li>
            <li> Works pretty good for a quick tightening, but doesn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t the best coverage.  It applies very easily and medium coverage.</li>
            <li> I thought this was a really neat and cool thing! I&#x27;ve not tried anything like it before so was quite excited to see how it would work. I like trying new things after all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very tiny and sleek in size so it will fit in almost any small purse or carry on bag for overniters or whatever and it only takes a small spritz on each cheek. You can go ahead and apply before your make-up or after but I have only used it before hand. The time it hits your face it is already at work tightening and firming up. I rub it in real fast because it doesn&#x27;t take it long to dry at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like it because it does make my face feel more firmer and my jaws seem less jiggly. (is that a word? LOL) It&#x27;s also great on the red splotches I have on my face. Which it does say it is good for Rosacea but not certain that is what I have just know it is small red splotchy places.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does have a very slight odor to it that is not bad smelling but I really don&#x27;t like perfumy smells on my face. But again it&#x27;s not really a strong enough odor and for the benefit of firming my skin I can deal with the slight aroma!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did receive this product for free in exchange for an honest review.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do a darn thing for me , perhaps my face has been drooping too long for anything to work . But it was worth a try ....</li>
            <li> Great product that you can see the results from! This product is very easy to use basically you just spray a small amount of it on your face.  Just remember to avoid your eyes, nostrils, and mouth of course. There&#x27;s no strong, overpowering aroma.  I definitely felt an overall tightening to the skin on my face. It wasn’t to the point where my face felt uncomfortable or anything. After using this product for a few days my face feels smoother and the skin has a nice healthy glow to my skin. I really like this Instant Face Lift - it goes on nicely and feels good under makeup. I received this as a gift to share my experiences while using this product.</li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed about this product was the scent. One of the ingredients is orange blossom water so it has a very light, clean, floral type scent. The scent isn&#x27;t strong but light and refreshing. I absolutely love the smell. The spray pump makes it easy to apply and the size is perfect to throw in my purse in case I need a little refreshing throughout the day. I don&#x27;t have huge pores although in certain spots they are more noticeable like on the sides of my nose and upper cheek areas. I find this spray does a good job at making those pores look smaller and my skin look overall smoother. I was afraid this would make my skin appear shiny but it doesn&#x27;t do that. It also isn&#x27;t sticky at all. I have used it both under my makeup and over it. Both ways work just the same and just as well. The formula doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all which is a huge plus. You do need to reapply this throughout the day but it does last for quite a few hours. I only applied it twice, once in the morning and once in the later afternoon to refresh it. Overall I really like this product. It smells great, is easy to use, and helps the texture/look of my skin. I did get this product with a discount/ promotion although my thoughts and opinions are always my own and unbiased.</li>
            <li> It is useless, doesn&#x27;t do a thing a real joke. There is no color, so I don&#x27;t know why the question is asked.  Don&#x27;t waste your time or money.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work as they claim.  I saw NO difference at all.  Waist of money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about a week. I don&#x27;t think it works on me. I see no difference when i use it.</li>
            <li> Too good to be true... Im using my boyfriend&#x27;s account, but Im female and I wanted to shrink my pores. Im very sad to report it did nothing for that. Also, literally within 2 minutes of spraying it on one half of my T-zone it started to turn red and irritated. I have sensitive skin + Protege&#x27;s other products I&#x27;ve liked (Embelash + I use their night cream). But this just didn&#x27;t work for me unfortunately. Wish it did!</li>
