            <li>I love, love, love this product too and the fact that I can get it here for a fraction of the price makes me love it all the more.  </li>

            <li>I love that I can use it as often as I want and it will not irritate my skin.</li>

            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>I wouldnt pay more for it thought</li>
            <li>otherwise it&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>One of my favorite skin care products.</li>
            <li>I love how well it works at removing everything.</li>
            <li>Skin looks better</li>
            <li>Love this product at this price.</li>
            <li>I mistakenly thought this would be more like a &amp;#34;paint</li>
            <li>Again, just okay.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve read several reviews regarding this product - some good; some not so good.</li>
            <li>I have to say this is a good, positive review.</li>
            <li>This is a great product  for sensitive skin, leaves a very smooth and clean skin without the abrasive</li>
            <li>I use this about once a week, it is really great, hard to get rolled off the face, but when I see the results afterwards on my skin, I am so happy</li>
            <li>I did pull of some fine hair on the sides of my face.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe how amazing this peel really is.  </li>
            <li>This is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>It peels the dead skin very effectively and leaves you feeling really nice and clean.</li>
            <li>I rubbed the Mineral Rich Peeling Gel on my visible flaky skin and it did the trick.</li>
            <li>This is great for getting dry skin &amp; oil from deeper in your skin</li>
            <li>I am a true believer</li>
            <li>A very nice gel that I apply with a fan brush (the kind used at a recent facial at a salon).</li>
            <li>Honestly this seems less effective than rubbing glue on your skin.</li>
            <li>Basically it&#x27;s a mild scrub</li>
            <li>I love these products and online you don&#x27;t pay the high prices you find at mall kiosks.</li>
            <li>I was very pleased with the experience I had with Amazon and would definitely recommend and use them again in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I liked the product they put on my hand, but they were so pushy that I didn’t want to go back to them.</li>
            <li>Well worth the money...</li>
            <li>I would suggest these products to anyone and everyone no matter your age, they are definitely worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Then wash with a gentle cleanser and moisturize with a rich but lightweight moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Take care to put the lid on right away after taking what you need from the jar.</li>
            <li>I have tried a lot of products over the years and this one is by far the best, every Seacret Product I have tried is amazing and leaves my skin feeling moisturized all day long, I live in the AZ which is dry and hot.</li>
            <li>all New Mineral Rich Peeling Gel is a fantastic product.&lt;br /&gt;The special gel gently exfoliates the skin, helping to remove dirt and buildup, leaving the skin soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>There appeared a significant amount of debris, enough to bring on feelings of disgust but which left the skin nice and smooth.</li>
            <li>Both products absorb very quickly into my skin and my skin feels moisturized and soft, but not oily.</li>
            <li>All New Mineral Rich Peeling Gel.]]</li>
            <li>My first experience of this product was when I was dragged to the stall at a mall.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better than any facial and it takes seconds - literally.</li>
            <li>this price keeps me coming back for more, thanks to the seller on Amazon!</li>
            <li>Also on some of the other things that I purchased that were Seacret spa items, the quality wasn&#x27;t as good as when I buy it direct</li>
            <li>When I was at our mall in Colorado shopping for Christmas gifts last year, I ran across this kiosk that was selling this amazing product and of course one of the sales reps stopped me, and usually I will tell them I am not interested but have a nice day :-)</li>
            <li>removes all dirt in the pores and leaves me skin feeling virgin again, very soft and fresh.</li>
            <li>I had to add warm water to my face and then pull those little balls off that area of my face one by one.</li>
            <li>It melts away any dead skin leaving and amazing polished skin underneath.</li>
            <li>and I would say my skin type is pretty “normal”</li>
            <li>If you really do want it get it here not from the rip off artists at the mall kiosks.</li>
            <li>Also, after you shower it off, your skin is much smoother and brighter.  </li>
            <li>It really really works.</li>
            <li>This works as an exfoliator but incredibly gentle.  </li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>This product really works; in fact, I ordered 2 additional for gifts.</li>
            <li>Then I moisturize my skin very well.  </li>
            <li>but none of these really did the job.</li>
            <li>It gently exfoliates skin on the face without tearing at the skin or leaving a rash.</li>
            <li>products on Amazon are much cheaper than the mall or their website.  </li>
            <li>My skin tends to turn red after using scrubs but this one is unique in that is works without being abrasive.</li>
            <li>I then saw a smaller advertisement through Amazon for the same product but at a more reasonable price and purchased through them!</li>
            <li>Apply lightly and completely over face, neck and upper chest areas.  </li>
            <li>iIt removes all the dead skin from my face, and leaves my skin very smooth.</li>
            <li>I would highly recomend this product.</li>
            <li>I have rosacea and the Mineral Rich Peeling Gel is the only exfoliator that does not irritate my overly sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>( If that occurs from time to time then I just add a little more on my neck/face</li>
            <li>I tried washing my face again with my normal product and then tried scrubbing them off with an exfoliating cotton pad...</li>
            <li>After a treatment, my skin looks like new.  </li>
            <li>I need help returning this stuff and getting a new one.</li>
            <li>, skin feels fresh and soft after using it, similar results to alpha hydrox</li>
            <li>This is better than any other facial product I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>and wow do it make a difference!</li>
            <li>and Wow!</li>
            <li>The product is jello like, half way filled jar.</li>
            <li>I have tried Avani(4 STAR), Vivo per lei (4star), Attitude(3Stars and over priced ), And Seacret Minerals from Dead Sea-All New Mineral Rich Peeling Gel(5 star)</li>
            <li>My skin is soft and supple.</li>
            <li>I’m in my early 30’s</li>
            <li>I have been using a prescription from my dermatologist for adult acne.</li>
            <li>And I endured years of acne even as an adult.  </li>
            <li>It has stopped my daughter&#x27;s acne completely.  </li>
            <li>It works to keep your skin smooth and diminishes wrinkles by literally peeling off dead skin.</li>
            <li>these products, I am a 50 year old woman who has struggled with acne all my life.  </li>
            <li>just rub a small amount on my face once a week and its like I left the spa &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>but I do have tiny, fine little hairs around my jaw line.</li>
            <li>I dries quickly and will leave little &amp;#34;rubber like&amp;#34; balls similiar to rubber cement on the inside of the lid.</li>
            <li>It is not easy to remove the tiny particules that stick to the fine hairs.</li>
            <li>For example: My oldest son whom is 17 has Sebbhoric Dermatitis, and the main target area as people with this condition well know is the scalp and around the forehead, nose, and cheeks; which causes patches of flaky dry skin to appear, and your face to look extremely red and irritated.</li>
            <li>I was a little nervous buying these online without having tried them first.  </li>
            <li>Very gentle ( Cliniques skin cleanser is my current one bur you can use Neutrogena or something cheaper and non drying , then I apply The Facial Peel and use my finger tips and palms for areas where dead skin is sometimes left over</li>
            <li>I am completely amazed every single time I use this stuff!</li>

            <li> It has stopped my daughter&#x27;s acne completely.  </li>
            <li> It works to keep your skin smooth and diminishes wrinkles by literally peeling off dead skin.</li>
            <li> these products, I am a 50 year old woman who has struggled with acne all my life.  </li>
            <li> just rub a small amount on my face once a week and its like I left the spa &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> but I do have tiny, fine little hairs around my jaw line.</li>
            <li> I dries quickly and will leave little &amp;#34;rubber like&amp;#34; balls similiar to rubber cement on the inside of the lid.</li>
            <li> It is not easy to remove the tiny particules that stick to the fine hairs.</li>
            <li> For example: My oldest son whom is 17 has Sebbhoric Dermatitis, and the main target area as people with this condition well know is the scalp and around the forehead, nose, and cheeks; which causes patches of flaky dry skin to appear, and your face to look extremely red and irritated.</li>
            <li> I was a little nervous buying these online without having tried them first.  </li>
            <li> Very gentle ( Cliniques skin cleanser is my current one bur you can use Neutrogena or something cheaper and non drying , then I apply The Facial Peel and use my finger tips and palms for areas where dead skin is sometimes left over</li>
            <li> I am completely amazed every single time I use this stuff!</li>
            <li> But if YOU have SENSITIVE SKIN rethink this before trying a peeling gel due to getting used to them and if that your case try Attitudes Line or another then build up to this one .This goes for ALOT OF $$$ IN MALL KIOSKS so..</li>
            <li> Anyway long story short...</li>
            <li> Rubs off with dry hand and the skin is instantly smoother.</li>
            <li> , I think that&#x27;s just the gel drying up and rolling into little balls that I can&#x27;t seem to completely rinse off.</li>
            <li> I can see my self continuing with this product for a long time.</li>
            <li> which you think is skin, but if you rub it off over the sink or tub, you&#x27;ll see the crud is tan in color, not clear like it went on.  </li>
            <li> recommend using a small amount on in the morning and very gently massaging the gel into the face to remove the dead skin.  </li>
            <li> The dry skin was gone and my skin was flake-free.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long ways though- especially with the day moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Although it helps with the acne pimples; it makes my skin very dry to the point you can see my skin flaking.</li>
            <li> Using just a little bit on my face, I can see skin fall in tiny fragments into the sink.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t reduce the size of my pores, but my skin is refreshed and pink.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t need any other cleansers</li>
            <li> I incorporate this into my other skin products.</li>
            <li> I have never used anything that works so well other than lazer treatments in the doctors office.</li>
            <li> I use it once or twice a week to remove the excess dead and dry skin that occurs after my rosacea rash has healed.</li>
            <li> Exfoliation also increases the effectiveness of my prescription creams and gels that I use on the active rash thus expediting the healing time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After testing several products, this was the worst and cost the most.</li>
            <li> To prevent the mess, I do the rubbing in the shower before turning on the water.</li>
            <li> I am over 40 and unfortunately laid in the sun from a very young age without sunscreen.  </li>
            <li> , I do get a little oily in my T-zone around mid-day.</li>
            <li> When you rub the gel on the face it eventually turns into little balls.  </li>
            <li> There isn&#x27;t anything on your skin that this stuff will not smooth out, or any blemish that this stuff will not visibly decrease after a few uses out of any other product I have used ever (and I have used a lot)!!</li>
            <li> but the \\&quot;stuff\\&quot; you think is dead skin coming off</li>
            <li> I like that I can order online and shipped to my door , plus I save a few $$ too.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s not overwhelming and doesn&#x27;t choke you to use it.  </li>
            <li> so hardly any photoshop/airbrushing is even needed ... )</li>
            <li> but it takes off a lot of icky stuff but doesn&#x27;t hurt.  </li>

            <li> My daughter bought this at Kiosk for a ridiculous price.</li>
            <li> This peeling gel really works, it takes out my dead skin and it looks nasty, I would recommend this product to anyone.  </li>
            <li> A couple of months later my son&#x27;s skin was looking really bad</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even know how to disprove it but its not a pleasant feeling.</li>
            <li> No 5 stars cause it does leave a sort of residue behind</li>
            <li> Just don&#x27;t buy it from the crazily well trained professionals at the mall.</li>
            <li> Of course it was still expensive...!</li>
            <li> but I couldn&#x27;t believe how expensive it was through them!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing! iIt removes all the dead skin from my face, and leaves my skin very smooth. I would highly recomend this product.</li>
            <li> It works! I love and the it makes me look is amazing. My skin is soft and supple.</li>
            <li> I give this zero stars.  I used it one time and will never use it again.  I am by no means a hairy woman but I do have tiny, fine little hairs around my jaw line. This s*** would NOT come off of that area of my face.  I tried washing my face again with my normal product and then tried scrubbing them off with an exfoliating cotton pad...they were still there.  I had to add warm water to my face and then pull those little balls off that area of my face one by one.</li>
            <li> I was a little nervous buying these online without having tried them first.  I was accosted by some kiosk people in the mall. I liked the product they put on my hand, but they were so pushy that I didn’t want to go back to them. Amazon is offering a cheaper price for both items then what the kiosk people were pushing them for anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I can honestly say that I love both the day moisturizer and the night cream. A little goes a long ways though- especially with the day moisturizer. Both products absorb very quickly into my skin and my skin feels moisturized and soft, but not oily. I’m in my early 30’s and I would say my skin type is pretty “normal”, I do get a little oily in my T-zone around mid-day.</li>
            <li> My daughter bought this at Kiosk for a ridiculous price. This stuff is amazing. My 56 year old skin looks and feels wonderful. [[ASIN:B002JUVH56 Secret Minerals From the Dead Sea- All New Mineral Rich Peeling Gel.]]</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read several reviews regarding this product - some good; some not so good. I have to say this is a good, positive review. I have been using a prescription from my dermatologist for adult acne. Although it helps with the acne pimples; it makes my skin very dry to the point you can see my skin flaking. I rubbed the Mineral Rich Peeling Gel on my visible flaky skin and it did the trick. The dry skin was gone and my skin was flake-free. I can see my self continuing with this product for a long time.</li>
            <li> Secret Minerals From the Dead Sea-all New Mineral Rich Peeling Gel is a fantastic product.&lt;br /&gt;The special gel gently exfoliates the skin, helping to remove dirt and buildup, leaving the skin soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> I will not purchase this product again.  When you rub the gel on the face it eventually turns into little balls.  After rinsing the product from the face, bits of the balls will stick to the tiny hairs on the lower face. It is not easy to remove the tiny particules that stick to the fine hairs.</li>
            <li> Honestly this seems less effective than rubbing glue on your skin. It doesn&#x27;t peel anything off, it just clumps up as soon as its rubbed. It does smell kinda nice but without the lotion it leaves your skin feeling...I don&#x27;t even know how to disprove it but its not a pleasant feeling. Way better price than at the kiosk tho. If you really do want it get it here not from the rip off artists at the mall kiosks.</li>
            <li> I wish this stuff came in a bigger size!  I don&#x27;t know how but it takes off a lot of icky stuff but doesn&#x27;t hurt.  I do wonder if like others have said it&#x27;s just the product rubbing off which you think is skin, but if you rub it off over the sink or tub, you&#x27;ll see the crud is tan in color, not clear like it went on.  Also, after you shower it off, your skin is much smoother and brighter.  I&#x27;ve also used it to take off peeling skin from sunburns.  I also like that it doesn&#x27;t have any fragrance so it&#x27;s not overwhelming and doesn&#x27;t choke you to use it.  I wish it came in a jar big enough for body use.</li>
            <li> Using just a little bit on my face, I can see skin fall in tiny fragments into the sink.  After a treatment, my skin looks like new.  It doesn&#x27;t reduce the size of my pores, but my skin is refreshed and pink.</li>
            <li> My first experience of this product was when I was dragged to the stall at a mall. Reluctantly, two kids a tow I pushed up my sleeve and I watched as the well groomed lady with hypnotic eyes circled her well manicured dainty finger in a circle. There appeared a significant amount of debris, enough to bring on feelings of disgust but which left the skin nice and smooth. I didn&#x27;t purchase until the second riptide pulled me away to the stall on another occasion. The guy, this time, did a deal with me. I bought. Of course it was still expensive...! Anyway long story short... I have never looked back and I guarantee that this will be on my bathroom shelf for the rest of my life. It really really works. It melts away any dead skin leaving and amazing polished skin underneath. It&#x27;s better than any facial and it takes seconds - literally. I love it with no hesitation. Just don&#x27;t buy it from the crazily well trained professionals at the mall. That is a rip off!</li>
            <li> This was a nice refresher.  I did pull of some fine hair on the sides of my face.  It was NOT greasy therefore I will continue to use and purchas again</li>
            <li> I love, love, love this product too and the fact that I can get it here for a fraction of the price makes me love it all the more.  I&#x27;ve been using the peeling gel once a week for more than two years now and it&#x27;s amazing.  My skin feels incredible afterwards and my makeup goes on like a dream.</li>
            <li> When you put it on it balls up on your face and even sticks to your face and you have to scrub it off.  Will not buy this again.</li>
            <li> I use this about once a week, it is really great, hard to get rolled off the face, but when I see the results afterwards on my skin, I am so happy</li>
            <li> You can see this thing cleaning your face! No 5 stars cause it does leave a sort of residue behind but you can get rid of it by washing with a face scrub. I use St Ives. exfoliating scrub.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for about a year.  It exfoliates your skin and makes it feel really good.  I would recommend it to anyone!</li>
            <li> Great product. I love that I can use it as often as I want and it will not irritate my skin. My skin tends to turn red after using scrubs but this one is unique in that is works without being abrasive.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this!  I am over 40 and unfortunately laid in the sun from a very young age without sunscreen.  Now I can see the damage I&#x27;ve done on my face!  And I endured years of acne even as an adult.  Well, this peeling gel along with dermabrasion has helped turn back the clock.  The fine lines I was noticing are diminishing and my skin has a beautiful glow.  Of course, I wear sunscreen now and have for sometime now.  This works as an exfoliator but incredibly gentle.  Love it - you need to try it!</li>
            <li> Like this stuff and way cheaper than what they were trying to sell it to me on the mall. Has helped even out skin tone and reduce the appearance of my pores</li>
            <li> I really like this product. Instantly gives a glow to the skin. I use it once a week. The lady at the mall stopped me and I tried it, and she tried her best to sell it to me but I knew i could get it cheaper on amazon.</li>
            <li> This product really works; in fact, I ordered 2 additional for gifts. I also plan on ordering more when I run out.</li>
            <li> I use it weekly. It peels the dead skin very effectively and leaves you feeling really nice and clean. one more word needed</li>
            <li> Save your money! After testing several products, this was the worst and cost the most.</li>
            <li> I like to use it on my knees then add lotion.  My knees are darker than the rest of my skin and it does seem to help.</li>
            <li> this was a good buy and i&#x27;m glad that i went through with it. very happy with the good price.</li>
            <li> This product saved my daughter&#x27;s skin!  I can&#x27;t believe how amazing this peel really is.  It has stopped my daughter&#x27;s acne completely.  I have even thrown away my Clarisonic - I just don&#x27;t need it anymore.  This is better than any other facial product I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> Bought it for 25 dollars and I love it. I wouldnt pay more for it thought, skin feels fresh and soft after using it, similar results to alpha hydrox</li>
            <li> This peeling gel really works, it takes out my dead skin and it looks nasty, I would recommend this product to anyone.  It works.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. Have been using it once a week for 2 years. Tried another company&#x27;s product but not as good. This is great for getting dry skin &amp; oil from deeper in your skin</li>
            <li> wonderful product works very well! and it came brand new in perfect condition</li>
            <li> I bought this at a mall kiosk and it seems to work well but the \\&quot;stuff\\&quot; you think is dead skin coming off, I think that&#x27;s just the gel drying up and rolling into little balls that I can&#x27;t seem to completely rinse off. It sticks to the tiny hairs on my jaw bone and I have to aggressively wash them off with soap. otherwise it&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> The product is jello like, half way filled jar. It is like rubbing glue(rubber cement) on my face and smell like glue also.It is not working for me, would not purchase again.</li>
            <li> Amazing peeling cleaner....this is my second time buying it. removes all dirt in the pores and leaves me skin feeling virgin again, very soft and fresh. Only use once a week. I don&#x27;t need any other cleansers just rub a small amount on my face once a week and its like I left the spa &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> A very nice gel that I apply with a fan brush (the kind used at a recent facial at a salon). Apply lightly and completely over face, neck and upper chest areas.  Rubs off with dry hand and the skin is instantly smoother. To prevent the mess, I do the rubbing in the shower before turning on the water. I incorporate this into my other skin products. will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> I have rosacea and the Mineral Rich Peeling Gel is the only exfoliator that does not irritate my overly sensitive skin.  I use it once or twice a week to remove the excess dead and dry skin that occurs after my rosacea rash has healed. Then I moisturize my skin very well.  Exfoliation also increases the effectiveness of my prescription creams and gels that I use on the active rash thus expediting the healing time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend using a small amount on in the morning and very gently massaging the gel into the face to remove the dead skin.  Then wash with a gentle cleanser and moisturize with a rich but lightweight moisturizer.</li>
            <li> This is fantastic.  I use it once a week and my skin looks and feels great.  I love these products and online you don&#x27;t pay the high prices you find at mall kiosks.</li>
            <li> How do I return it, the product in the jar is not a peeling gel. There must have been a mix up at the plant where you bought it from. I need help returning this stuff and getting a new one. Also on some of the other things that I purchased that were Seacret spa items, the quality wasn&#x27;t as good as when I buy it direct maybe it is close to expectation, I don&#x27;t know, but you need to have the quality</li>
            <li> This is a great product  for sensitive skin, leaves a very smooth and clean skin without the abrasive feel that  a chemical peel leaves in your skin.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite skin care products. It just works so well. You can see instant results with this. Anyone I use this on are impress with it. I know it&#x27;s for the face and neck specifically but I&#x27;ve used it on my feet and wow do it make a difference!</li>
            <li> I am completely amazed every single time I use this stuff! There isn&#x27;t anything on your skin that this stuff will not smooth out, or any blemish that this stuff will not visibly decrease after a few uses out of any other product I have used ever (and I have used a lot)!! For example: My oldest son whom is 17 has Sebbhoric Dermatitis, and the main target area as people with this condition well know is the scalp and around the forehead, nose, and cheeks; which causes patches of flaky dry skin to appear, and your face to look extremely red and irritated. We have been to several Dermatologist and Allergy specialists and they have given us tons of medications and ointments to use but none of these really did the job. When I was at our mall in Colorado shopping for Christmas gifts last year, I ran across this kiosk that was selling this amazing product and of course one of the sales reps stopped me, and usually I will tell them I am not interested but have a nice day :-) But, this time I didn&#x27;t and let him put some of this AMAZING STUFF on my hands and watched as it worked wonders on my skin. I was sold immediately with my son in mind. I couldn&#x27;t afford to buy at that time so he gave me the website info. A couple of months later my son&#x27;s skin was looking really bad so I decided to go to their website but I couldn&#x27;t believe how expensive it was through them! I then saw a smaller advertisement through Amazon for the same product but at a more reasonable price and purchased through them! I was very pleased with the experience I had with Amazon and would definitely recommend and use them again in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sincerely,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A. Aragon</li>
            <li> This is my go to for exfoliating my skin. I love how well it works at removing everything. I have used for years but found in the mall kiosks for twice the cost....this price keeps me coming back for more, thanks to the seller on Amazon! Update...12/7/16...the price is now over double! Will not be purchasing again!</li>
            <li> Great product! Well worth the money...</li>
            <li> I have tried Avani(4 STAR), Vivo per lei (4star), Attitude(3Stars and over priced ), And Seacret Minerals from Dead Sea-All New Mineral Rich Peeling Gel(5 star) I Do not WORK FOR THESE COMPANYS BUT, HAVE TRIED OTHERS ( THEY WERE JUST LISTED) But if YOU have SENSITIVE SKIN rethink this before trying a peeling gel due to getting used to them and if that your case try Attitudes Line or another then build up to this one .This goes for ALOT OF $$$ IN MALL KIOSKS so.. I like that I can order online and shipped to my door , plus I save a few $$ too. I was my face with something Very gentle ( Cliniques skin cleanser is my current one bur you can use Neutrogena or something cheaper and non drying , then I apply The Facial Peel and use my finger tips and palms for areas where dead skin is sometimes left over ( If that occurs from time to time then I just add a little more on my neck/face and Wow! Skin looks better ( You&#x27;ll notice a difference within 1-2 uses and After 6 Months You&#x27;ll notice ALOT ( I&#x27;m 30 and look 20 so... Yep it worked and I&#x27;m a model so hardly any photoshop/airbrushing is even needed ... ) Hope my review helps -Jen &amp;#34; I will let you know as the months go by .</li>
            <li> I paid $70 for this product for this product else where! When I bought I did not realize it was the same product. I thought I was buying a knock off! It works to keep your skin smooth and diminishes wrinkles by literally peeling off dead skin. I have never used anything that works so well other than lazer treatments in the doctors office. Take care to put the lid on right away after taking what you need from the jar. I dries quickly and will leave little &amp;#34;rubber like&amp;#34; balls similiar to rubber cement on the inside of the lid. This is the nature of the product. I hope Amazon carries this forever ... at this price!</li>
            <li> I love this product! It gently exfoliates skin on the face without tearing at the skin or leaving a rash.</li>
            <li> I have tried a lot of products over the years and this one is by far the best, every Seacret Product I have tried is amazing and leaves my skin feeling moisturized all day long, I live in the AZ which is dry and hot. I would recommend this to every one.</li>
            <li> Love this product at this price. You will see the difference immediately. Be prepared to be amazed. Use in tandem with Moisture Cream.</li>
            <li> I was talked into Seacret at the mall.  I am a true believer these products, I am a 50 year old woman who has struggled with acne all my life.  Since going to these products my face has cleared up.  I would suggest these products to anyone and everyone no matter your age, they are definitely worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The products on Amazon are much cheaper than the mall or their website.  I did see some posts about the expiration date, but I have not seen any difference between the products was not noticeable.</li>
            <li> I mistakenly thought this would be more like a &amp;#34;paint it on, peel it off&amp;#34; type peeling gel. But it&#x27;s not. Basically it&#x27;s a mild scrub that when you work it over kind of looks like your skin is peeling. Again, just okay. Don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll order again.</li>
