            <li>I have used this microwaveable no strip wax for over two years now and liked the product.</li>

            <li>This wax is so smooth and easy to peel off!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s microwavable, easy to use, no hassle of messing with strips.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy, it&#x27;s convenient, and best of all its mess free.</li>
            <li>Everything worked great, pain level wasn&#x27;t that bad...if you&#x27;ve ever gotten waxed, it&#x27;s the same pain level, but you&#x27;re doing it</li>
            <li>/&gt;It worked pretty well and easy to use!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a couple of different types of wax and this is the best one so far.</li>
            <li>and it gets all over my fingers and does not come off cleanly.</li>
            <li>overall good product-will continue experimenting</li>
            <li>Also, you can kind of see/feel the way the professional does</li>
            <li>product.&lt;br /&gt;You need to try a couple of time for find out the right amount of product that you need, but after the first time will be easy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had to return the last two wax treatments I purchased because it seems like the kind that requires strips even though the container says \\&quot;strip free\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just glad that I didn&#x27;t waste more than $20 on this product.</li>
            <li>I got this kit from Sally&#x27;s and just had to advise if it&#x27;s your first time purchasing this don&#x27;t do it.    </li>
            <li>you can remove it easily, or hot water always works.</li>
            <li>Went under the hot shower, it didn&#x27;t work.</li>

            <li>I&#x27;ve tried several and this is my favorite and the cost is reasonable.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t leave my skin as irritated as most wax does, definitely is a lot better than other brands I&#x27;ve tried!</li>
            <li>It does hurt, but all intimate waxing does.</li>
            <li>Hurt so much</li>
            <li>Even with following each step to the letter the wax wasn&#x27;t very effective, in fact it barely got half of the hairs in any area along my bikini line where the wax was applied.</li>
            <li>There is no indication on the package that there&#x27;s a new formula, so I&#x27;m not sure what the problem is, but it&#x27;s a shame because I really liked not having to buy strips.</li>
            <li>However if you leave it until it is no longer sticky and slightly warm but still hard it comes off well.</li>
            <li>This is the first wax I have ever used that removes all the hair and leaves bare skin.</li>

            <li>Normally I have it done professionally.</li>
            <li>It cooled too quickly and got really sticky and messy</li>
            <li>, I would highly recommend getting the kit first and then going back and getting the individual items as needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I just started getting Brazilian waxes done and went about five times to a professional.</li>
            <li>The reason being that the hair starts to grow back in much finer and makes it easier to do yourself.</li>
            <li>first experiment with waxing- can be a bit messy so make sure to put some paper towels down</li>
            <li>I was WAY less sensitive and did not get nearly as much post-waxing irritation as I did at the salon.</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;ve been waxed professionally for 5 years and did it myself for the last 2 years to save myself $, I made the mistake of trying something different when I got this)  </li>
            <li>Next time I&#x27;ll simply have it done professionally.</li>
            <li>When I apply the wax to my skin (even if I wait a long time for it to harden), the wax is still too soft to peel off the skin</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Great product! I&#x27;ve tried a couple of different types of wax and this is the best one so far. It doesn&#x27;t stick to your skin, which hurts less, and it gets all the hair.</li>
            <li> first experiment with waxing- can be a bit messy so make sure to put some paper towels down where u&#x27;re working- can be a bit painful on the bikini area so make sure to take a couple painkillers before- had to apply about twice or 3 times to get all of the hair- I think that could be cuz Im a novice- overall good product-will continue experimenting</li>
            <li> I got this kit from Sally&#x27;s and just had to advise if it&#x27;s your first time purchasing this don&#x27;t do it.    Pros:  -Not bad for underarm &amp; all areas except the Brazilian wax!  -Cheaper than the Pro  -Kit has all the necessities    Cons:  -Wax cools down quick  -Very messy (Goodluck if it gets on carpet; my husband was pissed when some got onto his leg hair! It&#x27;s like bubble gum stuck on there!)  -WAX OFF DOESN&#x27;T WORK (I had to peel each one off! Gaah it&#x27;s under my nails as I type and I keep finding pieces of wax in my hom)  -Torturous! (I&#x27;ve been waxed professionally for 5 years and did it myself for the last 2 years to save myself $, I made the mistake of trying something different when I got this)  -No strips so you peel the wax as if it were the actual strips. So I did a small straight line and when it came time to peel that sucker kept breaking and omg! It hurt like hell when I started to pull and repull when it broke. (I have a high pain tolerance, this was just absurd when I did my Brazilian! Couldn&#x27;t leave the job half way done so I bared through it!)😭😣😖</li>
            <li> I just started getting Brazilian waxes done and went about five times to a professional. I would recommend doing this before waxing yourself. The reason being that the hair starts to grow back in much finer and makes it easier to do yourself. Also, you can kind of see/feel the way the professional does it first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was totally blown away by how well the GiGi stuff worked. I was WAY less sensitive and did not get nearly as much post-waxing irritation as I did at the salon. I didn&#x27;t find it to be all that messy (I sat on a bunch of paper towels which worked well) and kept the wax on a candle warmer during the process. Incredibly impressed with the results and can&#x27;t believe how much money I am now saving by doing it myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I would highly recommend getting the kit first and then going back and getting the individual items as needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, I would also recommend getting the [[ASIN:B001DLAXAW PFB Vanish Ingrown Hair Treatment Roll On Gel - 4 oz]] if you have trouble with bumps after waxing, as I did. Works great!</li>
            <li> I love this kit. It comes with everything you need. It&#x27;s easy, it&#x27;s convenient, and best of all its mess free.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. I have been waxing for years (both at the salon and at home) and decided to try to do this myself again. This is the first wax I have ever used that removes all the hair and leaves bare skin. It does hurt, but all intimate waxing does.</li>
            <li> Even with following each step to the letter the wax wasn&#x27;t very effective, in fact it barely got half of the hairs in any area along my bikini line where the wax was applied. The wax was incredibly messy, constantly getting very stringy, and it kept solidifying in minutes, requiring me to microwave it several times. Either it was false advertising that it &amp;#34;removes course and stubborn hair from even the most sensitive of areas&amp;#34; or I have some incredibly tough and stubborn hairs. Next time I&#x27;ll simply have it done professionally. I&#x27;m just glad that I didn&#x27;t waste more than $20 on this product.</li>
            <li> This wax is so smooth and easy to peel off! It doesn&#x27;t leave my skin as irritated as most wax does, definitely is a lot better than other brands I&#x27;ve tried! I love that this wax you peel off and don&#x27;t need to go through the hassle of working with strips! GREAT BUY!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been waxing for about 10 years. Normally I have it done professionally. I had a few moments in the past when I decided to wax myself using strips method. It was messy but I could do that with no problem.&lt;br /&gt;After reading good reviews I ordered GiGi wax. If you want to use it on legs or arms it probably works ok. I needed Brazilian. It was incredibly messy. I managed to do only quarter. Little bit of thin wax always gets around, sticks on other hair, hands...with strips you can remove it easily, or hot water always works. This one was impossible to remove. It was just tiny bit of wax here and there. So I tried to use their wax remover, which didn&#x27;t work. Went under the hot shower, it didn&#x27;t work. So had to just scrape those bits with my nails. Slowly a bit by bit. Because it was a bikini area it was quite tricky. My skin completely red. Still have wax under my nails.&lt;br /&gt;So no, I would not recommend it at all.</li>
            <li> Everything worked great, pain level wasn&#x27;t that bad...if you&#x27;ve ever gotten waxed, it&#x27;s the same pain level, but you&#x27;re doing it so you know when to expect the pain so it isn&#x27;t as shocking! I will probably buy the warmer that they offer, because I had to reheat the wax once. It&#x27;s probably because I was taking longer than you should once you know how to do it. Anyway, I anticipate that this will save me a lot of money!</li>
            <li> I have used this microwaveable no strip wax for over two years now and liked the product. However, it appears that they have either recently changed their formula, or poured the wrong formula into the wrong containers. I&#x27;ve had to return the last two wax treatments I purchased because it seems like the kind that requires strips even though the container says \\&quot;strip free\\&quot;. When I apply the wax to my skin (even if I wait a long time for it to harden), the wax is still too soft to peel off the skin and it gets all over my fingers and does not come off cleanly. It&#x27;s almost impossible to remove - what a mess! There is no indication on the package that there&#x27;s a new formula, so I&#x27;m not sure what the problem is, but it&#x27;s a shame because I really liked not having to buy strips.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like that the instructions page doesn&#x27;t actually tell me how long to heat the wax. Overall I like the use of the wax. Note: If you leave the wax on too long where it is completely hard it will break into pieces when removing hair and leave wax residue or not completely come off as needed. However if you leave it until it is no longer sticky and slightly warm but still hard it comes off well. Does not get all the tiny hairs but does get most.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, is a very good product.&lt;br /&gt;You need to try a couple of time for find out the right amount of product that you need, but after the first time will be easy.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  It&#x27;s microwavable, easy to use, no hassle of messing with strips.  For me, this is the ideal wax.  I&#x27;ve tried several and this is my favorite and the cost is reasonable.</li>
            <li> this product is great</li>
            <li> Works great. Painful to do it myself but after a glass of wine, it was much easier to handle. The kit is awesome and easy to use.</li>

            <li> I never used wax product. and this is my first time to try brazilian waxing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It worked pretty well and easy to use! Love it and will buy it again once i am done with this oen.</li>
            <li> DIdn&#x27;t work for me &#x3D;( Hurt so much</li>
