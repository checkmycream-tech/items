            <li>THEY ARE MUCH QUICKER.SHIPPING TIME WAS GREAT.</li>
            <li>but i dont know what else to say too many words.</li>
            <li>ok ok ok ok..</li>
            <li>The best personal bath wipes.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more like a premoistened washcloth.</li>
            <li>You probably wont be able to heat them in a microwave unless you have a 12 volt microwave in your cab</li>
            <li>After using them, I felt that they did a much better job.</li>
            <li>Next best thing to a shower!</li>
            <li>Would I rather be able to take a shower?</li>
            <li>I am so glad I found these bath wipes.</li>
            <li>I prefer the &amp;#34;no rinse&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;Brand much better.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice to wash off the dirt and scrub the important bits with a couple of these.  </li>
            <li>Love &#x27;em, Amazon, and</li>
            <li>and find them really much better than the baby wipes I was using.</li>
            <li>In our opinions, they were the next best thing to a shower until he could take one.</li>
            <li>luck to everyone :)</li>
            <li>Once you are finished washing the fragrance fades, and you can perfume yourself with the smells you love.  </li>
            <li>Great product, fast delivery.</li>
            <li>Glad to have at Home.</li>
            <li>May work better if you use a sprinkling of powder after.</li>
            <li>They work okay</li>
            <li>Refreshing without leaving a sticky feeling.</li>
            <li>I also love that they are disposable, just use and throw away.  </li>
            <li>so I was happy to find them at Amazon at a ver reasonable price.</li>
            <li>They feel better on my skin also.</li>
            <li>They did smell better than another brand of antibacterial cloths, and cleaned well.  </li>
            <li>Satisfied with product and service.  </li>
            <li>Refreshing; these leave me feeling very clean and much better smelling&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li>It makes you feel better when you feel nice and clean.</li>
            <li>I love everything about this item; it&#x27;s efficient, clean, ability to warm in microwave and hold the warmth, disposable...</li>
            <li>The cloths do a great job of removing dirt and oils leaving you fresh and clean feeling.</li>
            <li>they&#x27;re think, make him feel nice &amp; clean.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never had an issue with them drying out, and IF they ever did, I&#x27;m sure a quick spritz with warm water would freshen them</li>
            <li>I felt very clean and moisturized.</li>
            <li>Even though my shower is complete (and beautiful), I will continue to keep these around for when I don&#x27;t have time to take a shower.</li>
            <li>Theses packages are great for personal hygiene, these packages can be placed in a microwave so that the moist towels are warm and refreshing.</li>
            <li>Great for whole body washing or quick cleanups!</li>
            <li>nice think wipes great for camping where showers not best option very nice quality!</li>
            <li>The wipes are very moist and have a pleasant smell.</li>

            <li>Washing with these is so easy and enjoyable.  </li>

            <li>Felt refreshed and clean!</li>
            <li>They leave his skin clean and moisturized - and it makes everything easier for me as well!</li>
            <li>The product is a easy quick way to clean up a bedridden person up when needed, not as good a bath/shower</li>
            <li>Most importantly, after surgeries when you are limited to showers/bathes they are the perfect way to take care of your hygiene.  </li>
            <li>Very good for  the skin integrity when used prior to applying bandages with tape.</li>
            <li>You can even microwave them to make it more comfortable to use.</li>
            <li>I love having these clothes available to freshen up when I want too.  </li>
            <li>They do the job really well, surprisingly.</li>
            <li>good product, they cleanse gently.  </li>
            <li>Just as good as Ready Bath which are way over priced.</li>
            <li>Can use right out of the package or microwave to warm it.</li>
            <li>These are awesome for people who are recovering from surgery, or can not shower/bathe for other reasons.  </li>
            <li>Very good quality -- better than I expected.</li>
            <li>skin dries out very quickly if i shower every day...</li>
            <li>They were easy to store in our camping supplies as well.</li>
            <li>Then they&#x27;re almost okay, except that I don&#x27;t feel clean.  </li>
            <li>it would not take that many to do a head to toe clean up on a child</li>
            <li>worked a lot better than the washcloth/water in a sink to make him feel clean without compromising the area of surgery.</li>
            <li>I think he felt a lot better in the hospital when he could clean up.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use and best part is the cloths can be warmed.&lt;br /&gt;much better for an invalid then messy water and wash ccloths.</li>
            <li>Delivery is always very&lt;br /&gt;prompt,  they are easy to order and</li>

            <li>The fragrance is a nice fresh scent hat the patient will enjoy.</li>
            <li>The scent is too strong for my tastes.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy to be ordering it online now for a friend about to go through major surgery.</li>
            <li>Was very glad to see that they are now sold on Amazon, much cheaper than elsewhere.</li>
            <li>, there is a foam insolation liner in the package to keep the cloths warm while you are using the first one,</li>
            <li>The product worked just fine and it achieved the reasons it was purchased.  </li>
            <li>Love these for bed baths or just a quick cleanup.  </li>

            <li>I was happy to find the same brand available on Amazon.</li>

            <li>Helps keep some one comfortable while they heal.</li>
            <li>These are fantastic and I can&#x27;t imagine not having them.</li>
            <li>But I liked them so much that now I use them sometimes after exercise</li>
            <li>This outfit also makes a waterless hair cleaning system, also available here a at Amazon</li>
            <li>They are great to take along in the RV in case you are short on water or lack of.  </li>
            <li>These are great for my elderly mom to use on a daily basis between showers.</li>
            <li>I found ideal for camping and although you couldn&#x27;t microwave them, I found you can warm them up with warm water either in a closed package or individually.</li>
            <li>They are fantastic.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re fabulous if you can&#x27;t get in a shower or bath for whatever reason.</li>

            <li>Thanks!!!</li>
            <li>They are a great way to clean up in the moring before starting your day and without using a lot of water taking a shower.</li>
            <li>Make sure you heat them up a little for a much more pleasant experience.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ll continue to use them until I can get better, hopefully, and be able to resume my normal shower routine.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>These disposable washcloths are soft, lightly scented, and very refreshing.</li>
            <li>The cloths are so soft and they clean exceptionally well.  </li>
            <li>and I was very satisfied with the complete process</li>
            <li>/&gt;Followup i am so impressed with the thickness of these bathing cloths and with how long they stay wet, so much more than any others that we&#x27;ve used!</li>
            <li>product works well for when you need to get clean and you can&#x27;t shower or bathe</li>
            <li>They make you feel really clean and refreshed.  </li>
            <li>Kept me clean for 4 day hike.  </li>
            <li>I have used them to keep clean in a semi, but I&#x27;m about to have a surgery, and I know they will be helpful to me now.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is not overpowering, you feel clean.</li>
            <li>These were so helpful to keep clean.</li>
            <li>I was a clean freak all my life.</li>
            <li>But I am one clean person.</li>
            <li>so we don&#x27;t have to clean out the stuff we store in the shower every day when we are on the road.  </li>
            <li>so you have a clean body to put in clean cloths.  </li>
            <li>but youll be clean and a lot happier and healthier than if you dont use them.</li>
            <li>and she&#x27;s clean.</li>
            <li>We are one week into the remodeling, and I feel and smell clean.</li>
            <li>I felt refeshed and clean.  </li>
            <li>and I have to clean up in a hurry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t have to rinse, and leave the skin feeling clean and moisturized.</li>
            <li>They clean off the skin without leaving a sticky or soapy type residue.</li>
            <li>All I can say is they make me feel clean.  </li>
            <li>If you have to clean up and can&#x27;t get to a sink or shower, these towelettes will serve you well.  </li>
            <li>Mom says they clean her well and do not cause her to itch.  </li>
            <li>These towelettes are strong and useful.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m disabled and this is one good way to stay clean between showers!!</li>
            <li>these are very nice to use  and don&#x27;t dry out my &amp;#34;OLD&amp;#34; skin.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is fresh, clean and light.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;These would be great for a parent on the road with small children, motion sickness, &amp;quot;accidents&amp;quot;, ice cream stickies, all of these things could be quickly dealt with, these are much, much better then a baby wipe, and you have the option of full head to toe clean up without water</li>
            <li>, Shields still have their place, when I need a bit more skin lubrication, but Comfort Bath towels are great for everyday use!  </li>
            <li>I use it on my boat when I don&#x27;t want to bother with a full shower and it works.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve recommended it to friends in the same situation and they have also loved it.  </li>
            <li>My mother-in-law started using them in the hospital and loved them, especially warmed.</li>
            <li>Much thicker than most.  </li>
            <li>I also bought some for myself as I wanted to try them for quick clean ups when I don&#x27;t have time for a shower.</li>
            <li>/&gt;They can&#x27;t be beat for quick clean ups while travelling or camping.  </li>
            <li>I keep a supply on hand at all times to be used for a quick clean and just incase the water supply is stops.  </li>
            <li>EASY CLEAN UP AND REFRESHING WITH NO MESS.</li>
            <li>I used one &amp;#34;set,&amp;#34; for partial washups, and I can see that they would work very nicely for the full bedside bath they&#x27;re designed to provide.  </li>
            <li>These adult washcloths really do the trick - I feel completely clean after using them &amp; buying them in this value size made them fairly cost-efficient.  </li>
            <li>and it leaves me clean and with a fresh aroma.</li>
            <li>and you do feel fresh and clean.  </li>
            <li>I felt fresh and clean.  </li>

            <li>Gets very hot</li>
            <li>The cloths are also great for older seniors who have physical restrictions.</li>
            <li>are soft and comfortable easy to use, and are great for when someone can&#x27;t get in the bath or shower due to injury or illness.  </li>

            <li>These are great for people who can&#x27;t shower everyday, or if you just went to the gym and want to freshen up.</li>
            <li>My grandma can&#x27;t bath everyday, so these have been a great help.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny.  </li>
            <li>, if you use 2, that&#x27;s 4 days worth.  </li>
            <li>Same used in hospitals &amp; nice warmed in microwave.</li>
            <li>but it is not necessary for them to be effective for a thoroughly cleaned experience.&lt;br /&gt;Sage</li>
            <li>She has been using them cool because it has been hot here, but she was so thankful for them.  </li>
            <li>They left a film or residue on the skin that was kind of tacky.  </li>
            <li>Baby wipes are $2 a pack, and you get $2 of worth of service.</li>
            <li>Well worth it.</li>
            <li>Just microwave for short time to warm up towelettes.  </li>
            <li>Worth every penny</li>

            <li>These cloths can be used right out of the package or heated in the microwave.</li>

            <li>Fantastic product highly recommend these. .</li>
            <li>that the instructions say the eight cloths in a pack equal one \\&quot;bath\\&quot;, but I find four more than adequately cleans me up</li>
            <li>The scent was not overwhelming either, which made this a great camping product.</li>
            <li>These are great - my husband is disabled from a stroke &amp; has had many medical issues since.  </li>

            <li>The price was very reasonable.</li>

            <li>They kept me clean and fresh for several days where and when access to clean running water was unavailable.  </li>
            <li>Although these washcloths are intended for bed baths, they are also a quick and convenient way to clean up quickly after a workout, especially if you don&#x27;t have time for a shower.</li>
            <li>She loves the product which leaves her feeling fresh and with soft clean skin.</li>
            <li>They clean well but kind of leave a sticky feeling on the skin even after dried.</li>

            <li>In emergencies, car breakdowns, or more  medical independency everyone should have a suppy.</li>
            <li>Very valuable to me!</li>
            <li>I first used it while in hospital.</li>
            <li>I was first introduced to this while in a hospital, they sent one pack home with me</li>
            <li>OK if you don&#x27;t mind smelling l like &amp;#34;eau de hospital corridor&amp;#34; I bought two units of this to &amp;#34;fight back&amp;#34; against our Water District&#x27;s punitive two month water conservation program, wherein if I don&#x27;t conserve water, my sewer bill will go up for an entire year.</li>
            <li>I think the average user would be very satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li>They are really nice to use if you pre-heat for 20 sec.</li>
            <li>These work pretty well.</li>
            <li>I am taking care of an elderly aunt who is no longer able to get into the shower and she loves to bathe with the personal cleansing pads.</li>
            <li>I use them in our First Aide Kit, put some in our guest bath, our bath and in my tote..  </li>
            <li>They are exactly like the ones that the hospital uses.</li>
            <li>I like the fact that they can be used at room temperature or can be warmed in the microwave for a hot bath.</li>
            <li>Exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>I first saw these for use in the hospital.  </li>
            <li>;) trust.</li>
            <li>PRODUCT WAS EXACTLY AS DESCRIBED.WOULD PURCHASE AGAIN.</li>
            <li>They came promptly and are just like the ones used in the hospital where I first saw them.  </li>
            <li>and I was only able to take 3 showers.  </li>
            <li>I \\&quot;discovered\\&quot; these bath cloths during a recent hospitalization and was pleased to find them on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is the first time I ordered these wash cloths.</li>
            <li>These wipes are great for people with limited ability to use tub or shower, especially when warmed.</li>
            <li>And you really feel clean after using it to take a \\&quot;bath.\\&quot;  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>They are handy for use while traveling and for those who cannot bathe or shower due to illness or disability.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Large, Strong, soft, very moist wipes.  </li>
            <li>These are great disposable wash cloths--nice and thick with plenty of bathing solution--great for older people and care givers!</li>
            <li>But just enough to clean!</li>
            <li>:  They are thick, washcloth type disposable cloths.  Microwaving them for several seconds make them nice and warm.</li>
            <li>Not only does it clean very well but imagine how much money u will save on ur water bill!!</li>
            <li>These are perfect for keeping clean when unable to properly shower or take a bath while recovering from surgery.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re thick, have a pleasant fragrance and get the dirt off my elbows.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll certainly buy then again if/when the need arises and recommend them to anyone who&#x27;s prepping for post-op care.  </li>
            <li>the only thing I strongly recommend is that you warm the little cloths before you use them,</li>
            <li>These wipes are the same wipes the nurses used in the hospital and really make it easy for him to see to his hygiene while I&#x27;m at work.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and leaves the skin soft and smooth,wonderful for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>They are used on an elderly disabled individual in between baths and work great.</li>
            <li>You really feel like you&#x27;ve just bathed or showered.</li>
            <li>and they work really well..</li>
            <li>Need to improve the smell, smells to much like medicine.</li>
            <li>Its much easier for my caregiver.</li>
            <li>They worked very well.</li>
            <li>My mom is using them thanks</li>
            <li>They’re wonderful for emergency cleanups and days when a shower is inconvenient.</li>
            <li>I  have also used comfort bath, &amp; it seems to work very well.</li>
            <li>My husband used these when he couldn&#x27;t get in or out of the tub very well any longer.</li>
            <li>so I have to be there if he wants a real shower for safety.</li>
            <li>My husband did not care for them as much</li>
            <li>She really likes the fact that they can be heated in the microwave.</li>
            <li>The cloths make a bed bath much easier.</li>
            <li>Usually I&#x27;m in a much hotter year-round climate where I always have a package</li>
            <li>These very substantial but disposable washcloths were just what we needed when my sister was recovering from hip replacement surgery.</li>
            <li>This is a quality X10 product, NOT NO cheapo baby wipes which leave a whole lot to be desired.</li>
            <li>This is like a wash cloth and NOT a thin baby wipe.</li>
            <li>SOOOOOOO much easier that dragging out soap, water, washcloth, towel... etc.</li>
            <li>We also use these when we go camping, and they work very well for that.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend these!</li>
            <li>He said they really did the job.</li>
            <li>You feel just as if you had a real bath.  </li>
            <li>, I thought I&#x27;d try these bath wipes, not expecting as much as the Shields.  </li>
            <li>When you have a need for these you really need them.  </li>
            <li>Cloths\\&quot; really came to my rescue.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it unreasonable to expect these people to be trustworthy, ethical.</li>
            <li>Thanks to who ever made this product</li>
            <li>Moistened and ready to use.</li>
            <li>Cleans very well and removes odors.</li>
            <li>For my money, I really like the No Rinse wipes, as they don&#x27;t have the two downsides that I mentioned.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>and she really likes them.  </li>
            <li>This cleans very well.  </li>
            <li>I just keep a few boxes of these wipes handy at all times -</li>
            <li>especially his bottom always gets a yeast infection-so I need disposable soft wash cloths and these are at the top of my list.</li>
            <li>/&gt;+ Thick; holds up well, even with a good amount of scrubbing</li>
            <li>Baby wipes are great for little ones, but they&#x27;re harder to use on an adult with special needs.</li>
            <li>so they don;t fall apart in use and are large enough to clean all the body.  </li>
            <li>Kept me sweet and clean ... and far less drying than soap and hot water!  </li>
            <li>I have tried other brands of the same thing and know good when I have it</li>
            <li>They are also moist enough to clean your whole body with 1 cloth.  </li>
            <li>These can be used several times for that and then clean up the whole bathroom sink area</li>
            <li>They re-seal and keep their moistness even in a hot cabinet, in a hot truck with no air when it sits in the hot sun when we are at home in central Texas.</li>
            <li>they are useful for removing whatever you need to remove and are gentle on the skin.the size is okay for small jobs</li>
            <li>Between a wheelchair 99% of the time and not at all able to shower other than 1% of the time.</li>
            <li>or if I&#x27;m feeling really lazy and don&#x27;t want to shower one day :)!  </li>
            <li>I have used other products that are much better.</li>
            <li>understand why it&#x27;s better to not use alcohol or some other drying agent in the liquid cleaner but</li>
            <li>Better than any other brand I have tried.</li>
            <li>They were essential during my husband&#x27;s recent illness, but also handy for when normal bathing isn&#x27;t practical.</li>
            <li>So much better than normal wet wipes.</li>
            <li>You can even clean them and use them several times if you want because of the quality.</li>
            <li>They are large, thick, easy to use and leave you feeling clean.  </li>
            <li>You warm them in the microwave first which is very comforting for an elderly person who gets cold easily.  </li>
            <li>not only very convenient , but soft on the skin and order free.  </li>
            <li>My skin feels great after I use them, much less dry and very soft.  </li>
            <li>One wipe down and I feel 1000% better.  </li>
            <li>I liked this slightly better for general all over bathing because they seemed to be slightly more moist but preferred the other brand for the private parts because they left less moisture in that area.  </li>
            <li>This is a wonderful product for those of us who are unable to bathe or shower in the traditional ways (catheters, &amp;#34;pjc&amp;#34; lines, etc.).</li>
            <li>Plenty of towelettes in each pack to adequately lather up the entire body.  </li>
            <li>I could have ordered a similar product from a more reliable company and had them three weeks ago and the product I actually received would have been of some use to me.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, and what, in the current state of disgust, is most probable, I will just throw them away to keep from being constantly reminded of how I allowed myself to trust, spend,</li>
            <li>The reason that I only gave it four stars is because when you put it in the microwave to heat it is very hot and a quick minute later it cools off.</li>
            <li>They ship fast, are good quality, and one wipe usually does the trick, as opposed to upwards of 20 baby wipes for the same cleaning.</li>
            <li>Will continue to buy this product and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend shopping with this seller.</li>

            <li>Wipes are of high quality</li>
            <li>Highly recommend these.</li>
            <li>I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THESE.</li>
            <li>I can see where these will be handy for lot of other things, once my incision has healed and I&#x27;m back on my feet.  </li>
            <li>They are thick and super wet, plus they smell good.</li>
            <li>These wipes are great to have handy away from home on a hot day or if you work hard and get dirty.  </li>
            <li>Tonight I opened up a package that was four years old and they are still very moist and comforting.  </li>
            <li>But they cost far too much.</li>
            <li>I use these everyday and love them.  </li>
            <li>&amp; I&#x27;ve had increasing trouble getting into it as my rheumatoid arthritis has gotten progressively more disabling.  </li>
            <li>is when I have an open package that wasn&#x27;t correctly resealed and had been sitting over a long period of time (2 weeks or more).  </li>
            <li>These wipes are a nice size, sufficiently moist, and thick, what I thought I&#x27;d like.  </li>
            <li>These cloths are thick and warm in the microwave for patient comfort.</li>
            <li>These are nice and thick.  </li>
            <li>what good is a thin cloth when trying to bathe an elderly person?  </li>
            <li>nice and thick  will purchase agein</li>
            <li>They are nice and thick, and can heat in the microwave.</li>
            <li>I use these for my mother--they are nice and thick.  </li>
            <li>These are super soft, and can be used multiple times</li>
            <li>I bought these right after I had back surgery.</li>
            <li>The Simply Right are 12\\&quot;X8\\&quot;, so they&#x27;re slightly larger than these Comfort 8\\&quot;X8\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>Each towelette will give you plenty of usage compared to other brands that are Mae cheap.</li>
            <li>Wash cloths are thick and stay hot in the insulated bag they are warmed in, staying warm until the entire bath is completed.</li>
            <li>The quality of the cloths is pretty good - they are thick, durable, and aren&#x27;t too rough on the skin.</li>
            <li>The bath wash clothes are very good and help me when I am unable to take a regular shower.</li>
            <li>Stay clean even when Bandages prevent wet bathing.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and had no problem using.  </li>
            <li>But I tried them out of necessity, and I was very surprised and pleased!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t need them to replace a bath but use them between daily baths to  keep sensitive areas as clean as is possible to keep human skin with its own natural flora and constant exposure to possible pathogens.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re also quite thick, so they&#x27;re pretty easy to use.</li>
            <li>They are pretty thick and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>A boon for an old lady with balance problems!</li>
            <li>I love my showers usually twice a day</li>
            <li>I tried many disposable cleaning cloths in the past.  </li>
            <li>My bathroom is so small I can&#x27;t safely give myself a sponge bath there</li>
            <li>This is exactly what I was looking for and my medical supply company no longer carries these.</li>
            <li>Recently, I used a cloth and was surprised at how nice and thick the pad really was.</li>
            <li>We us several of these daily to care for my sensitive skin areas and to clean up a couple of wound beds twice each day.  </li>
            <li>These thick clothes (when heated for a few seconds in the microwave) create a warm comforting bath and leave you feeling clean and refreshed.</li>
            <li>These are a quick, convenient way to bathe with minimal to no water.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Secondly, each cloth is just moist enough - neither too dry, nor too wet.&lt;br /&gt;Thirdly, the cleansing fluid in the product has a very light, clean fragrance - not sweet or flowery, and I was grateful for that.</li>
            <li>My husband graciously helps me bathe since my mobility is so limited right now</li>
            <li>I can sit or lie down and clean my body with no problem.  </li>
            <li>Pop them in the microwave and wipe down to get truly clean without stripping your skin.</li>
            <li>Does the job in getting you clean, but I experienced two problems:  (1)  actually made my skin feel too sticky, grippy and tacky.  </li>
            <li>They left me feeling a little sticky, but were better than using water.</li>
            <li>This product was a great disappointment.</li>
            <li>These washcloths are really hefty and soft at the same time.  </li>
            <li>(pardon me) because I&#x27;m old old old now, poop and pee on myself from time to time.</li>
            <li>my experience with them does not speak well for them, their practice is as far from ethical as it is possible to devolve.</li>
            <li>These are great for those who are unable to bathe on a regular basis.  </li>
            <li>I have used them in caring for my family and professionally.</li>
            <li>They are big, and holds a lot of soap, it&#x27;s not too much where it will be dripping all over.</li>
            <li>Leaves the skin soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li>Was pleasantly surprised that it cleanses well.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used a product similar to this before on hunting trips,&amp; really appreciated it.</li>
            <li>Add a teaspoon of water and pop in the microwave for a much more comfortable bathing experience for your ill relative.</li>
            <li>My skin feels soft and refreshed.  </li>
            <li>so I was pleasantly surprised that these do the job.</li>
            <li>WOW...</li>
            <li>This feels really soft against the body.  </li>
            <li>Having automatically discarded the shipping materials when they arrived I can&#x27;t return them and am left with towelettes I might be able to wet and use for the dog if adding water will actually soften them.</li>
            <li>You have to be careful not to overheat them in the microwave because you could burn yourself and also make sure the are opened enough to stay open when heating or soap and moisture will bubble up out into your oven.  </li>
            <li>They really are quite thick and filled with a soothing cleanser.  </li>
            <li>THe size is easy to use, the cloths are thick and don&#x27;t shred, they warm up in the microwave, and they are small enough to carry along in a purse/tote.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>We read a small study in which high school wrestlers did this, and the group that used these had significantly fewer skin infections.</li>
            <li>These large, thick and moist wipes leave you feeling clean and refreshed.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t get around easily and my bathroom is too small for walkers or wheel chairs.</li>
            <li>I ordered these due to having foot surgery and not being able to get the dressings wet.</li>
            <li>so a quick wipe down</li>
            <li>No mess and work well</li>
            <li>No mess, I bath her once or twice a day  with them</li>
            <li>No fuss, no mess, just heat in microwave and use to give myself a sponge bath.</li>
            <li>My only wish is that each cloth was a bit larger, but that is just a personal preference because the size is adequate.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Having recently gone through a total knee replacement, I stocked up on these to get through the first couple of weeks while my mobility was questionable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend this to anyone that could use some extra help with bathing.  </li>
            <li>Both are great products and saved the day for me during this very difficult time.</li>
            <li>The towels are thick and soft, the scent is kind of odd though, not really fresh or clean smelling.</li>
            <li>These large thick disposable washcloths are so useful to have on hand.  </li>
            <li>I can only surmise that, as other customers have experienced, these are outdated items.  </li>
            <li>They are thick and treated with aloe and other non-irritating ingredients to help you clean quickly and leave you feeling refreshed.  </li>
            <li>Great item especially because it can be heated in the microwave, so it wont be cold.</li>
            <li>They also wash and dry very we;; and can be used over and over.</li>
            <li>Comfort Bath personal cleansing is very convenient for a frail person like me with the relative ease of scrubbing with the cloths.</li>
            <li>I purchased this Comfort Bath Personal Cleaning Ultra thick wash cloths  for a dear friend whose husband has Dementia and has to be taken care of,cleaned up many times a day.</li>
            <li>This were so strong and thick.</li>
            <li>Simply Right brand, which arrived more dry than wet and weren&#x27;t as thick.  </li>
            <li>this product keeps me clean with very little hassle.  </li>
            <li>These cloths are nice and thick they do not tear as you wipe them over your skin which has been my experience with other brands of disposable washcloths.  </li>
            <li>My disabled wife uses them to keep clean on the days when it is not possible to shower do to spikes in pain.</li>
            <li>I am unable to take showers and this product leaves me feeling as clean and fresh as if I&#x27;ve showered.  </li>
            <li>However, they are smaller (albeit thicker) than Simply Right Adult Washcloths and seem to leave a slight residue.</li>
            <li>these are thick and large and really get the job done!  </li>
            <li>Perfect for my 90 year old Mom during the cold winter months!!</li>
            <li>They work well and they are soft and last.</li>
            <li>Totally made the days post surgery where showering and baths weren&#x27;t an option far easier to tolerate when I could get someone to help me use these cloths to cleanse myself.  </li>
            <li>Bare foot gal.</li>
            <li>She won&#x27;t tolerate coarse materials on her sensitive areas either.  </li>
            <li>The cloths are moist with no rinse soap solution and thick, not thin like the cloth wet wipes ubiquitously available in stores.</li>
            <li>The bath washcloths are nice but, just too expensive.  </li>
            <li>Nurse tells me these are so much better than the paper thin &amp;#</li>
            <li>They do dry my skin out a little bit but that is a minor issue compared to not being able to shower.  </li>
            <li>Just okay..not as thick as I expected and went through them pretty quickly .</li>
            <li>I wish they were a little thinner but a little bigger and packed in individual wrappers, but they will do nicely.</li>
            <li>My only complaint about this product is that it cools off very quickly.  </li>
            <li>No, you don&#x27;t feel as clean as you do with a shower, but you will feel cleaner than with any other rinseless wipe (can&#x27;t remember all the brands I have tried as I&#x27;ve been using the Comfort Bath wipes for a number of years).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the only time I have found wipes dry in the package</li>
            <li>my daughter who gets her feet really dirty playing outside can use these quickly and easily instead of taking a shower.</li>
            <li>They have a very faint, pleasant scent, and leave no residue on the skin.</li>
            <li>Soft, fluffy, large.</li>
            <li>Could be a little moister but nice and thick and can be heated in microwave before use.</li>
            <li>With my extra sensitive skin it is absolutely necessary to get all residue from both medicine and adhesive off, and these do without having to scrub.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>These are very nice to have when you have a sick person at home.  </li>
            <li>Following major surgery, I used these disposable cleansing cloths in the hospital.</li>
            <li>This is my first purchase from Amazon; I previously purchased them at a local drugstore.  </li>
            <li>I first used this product as a hospital patient a few yeas ago.</li>
            <li>My adult some who has sever disabilities and is total care is difficult to bathe more than once a week in the bath tub.  </li>
            <li>These are the ones that are thick, durable, and full of suds.  </li>
            <li>If I just plan to use one or two towels only I remove one towel at a time and run a little hot water on it.</li>
            <li>Dispose of in Trash NOT Toilet!</li>
            <li>Subtle clean fragrance.  </li>
            <li>The wipes are really thick, so you go through them quite quickly.  </li>
            <li>I find these very convenient for a quick way to refresh when unable to use a regular shower.</li>

            <li> I love them.  </li>
            <li> and he agrees that the product is much better than what he was planning on doing to help me bathe - a damp washcloth and sudsy water in the sink.  </li>
            <li> Great product for cleaning fast</li>
            <li> Not being able to shower for 2 mos ..</li>

            <li> refreshing .</li>
            <li> Love this product and its quality.</li>
            <li> Neither brand will exfoliate old skin and residue and they&#x27;re no substitute for a good shower, but good to have for simple/small clean-ups.  </li>
            <li> LOVE this item...</li>
            <li> I am mostly bald</li>

            <li> ok ok ok ok..</li>
            <li> The best personal bath wipes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more like a premoistened washcloth.</li>
            <li> You probably wont be able to heat them in a microwave unless you have a 12 volt microwave in your cab</li>
            <li> After using them, I felt that they did a much better job.</li>
            <li> Next best thing to a shower!</li>
            <li> Would I rather be able to take a shower?</li>
            <li> I am so glad I found these bath wipes.</li>
            <li> I prefer the &amp;#34;no rinse&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;Brand much better.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice to wash off the dirt and scrub the important bits with a couple of these.  </li>
            <li> Love &#x27;em, Amazon, and</li>
            <li> and find them really much better than the baby wipes I was using.</li>
            <li> In our opinions, they were the next best thing to a shower until he could take one.</li>
            <li> luck to everyone :)</li>
            <li> Once you are finished washing the fragrance fades, and you can perfume yourself with the smells you love.  </li>
            <li> Great product, fast delivery.</li>
            <li> Glad to have at Home.</li>
            <li> May work better if you use a sprinkling of powder after.</li>
            <li> They work okay</li>
            <li> Refreshing without leaving a sticky feeling.</li>
            <li> I also love that they are disposable, just use and throw away.  </li>
            <li> so I was happy to find them at Amazon at a ver reasonable price.</li>
            <li> They feel better on my skin also.</li>
            <li> They did smell better than another brand of antibacterial cloths, and cleaned well.  </li>
            <li> Satisfied with product and service.  </li>
            <li> Refreshing; these leave me feeling very clean and much better smelling&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li> It makes you feel better when you feel nice and clean.</li>
            <li> I love everything about this item; it&#x27;s efficient, clean, ability to warm in microwave and hold the warmth, disposable...</li>
            <li> The cloths do a great job of removing dirt and oils leaving you fresh and clean feeling.</li>
            <li> they&#x27;re think, make him feel nice &amp; clean.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had an issue with them drying out, and IF they ever did, I&#x27;m sure a quick spritz with warm water would freshen them</li>
            <li> I felt very clean and moisturized.</li>
            <li> Even though my shower is complete (and beautiful), I will continue to keep these around for when I don&#x27;t have time to take a shower.</li>
            <li> Theses packages are great for personal hygiene, these packages can be placed in a microwave so that the moist towels are warm and refreshing.</li>
            <li> Great for whole body washing or quick cleanups!</li>
            <li> nice think wipes great for camping where showers not best option very nice quality!</li>
            <li> The wipes are very moist and have a pleasant smell.</li>
            <li> I like these because they are handy and quick to use.</li>
            <li> Quick and effective.  </li>

            <li> Washing with these is so easy and enjoyable.  </li>
            <li> It was a nice feature that you could warm them up really helped my husband feel refreshed and</li>
            <li> Felt refreshed and clean!</li>
            <li> They leave his skin clean and moisturized - and it makes everything easier for me as well!</li>
            <li> The product is a easy quick way to clean up a bedridden person up when needed, not as good a bath/shower</li>
            <li> Most importantly, after surgeries when you are limited to showers/bathes they are the perfect way to take care of your hygiene.  </li>
            <li> Very good for  the skin integrity when used prior to applying bandages with tape.</li>
            <li> You can even microwave them to make it more comfortable to use.</li>
            <li> I love having these clothes available to freshen up when I want too.  </li>
            <li> They do the job really well, surprisingly.</li>
            <li> good product, they cleanse gently.  </li>
            <li> Just as good as Ready Bath which are way over priced.</li>
            <li> Can use right out of the package or microwave to warm it.</li>
            <li> These are awesome for people who are recovering from surgery, or can not shower/bathe for other reasons.  </li>
            <li> Very good quality -- better than I expected.</li>
            <li> skin dries out very quickly if i shower every day...</li>
            <li> They were easy to store in our camping supplies as well.</li>
            <li> Then they&#x27;re almost okay, except that I don&#x27;t feel clean.  </li>
            <li> it would not take that many to do a head to toe clean up on a child</li>
            <li> worked a lot better than the washcloth/water in a sink to make him feel clean without compromising the area of surgery.</li>
            <li> I think he felt a lot better in the hospital when he could clean up.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use and best part is the cloths can be warmed.&lt;br /&gt;much better for an invalid then messy water and wash ccloths.</li>
            <li> Delivery is always very&lt;br /&gt;prompt,  they are easy to order and</li>
            <li> She is able to clean herself well with these wipes.  </li>
            <li> These disposable washcloths are dependable and strong.</li>
            <li> I had a strong allergic reaction to the use of this product.  </li>
            <li> Arrived quickly; nice feel and good for personal cleansing</li>
            <li> The fragrance is a nice fresh scent hat the patient will enjoy.</li>
            <li> The scent is too strong for my tastes.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy to be ordering it online now for a friend about to go through major surgery.</li>
            <li> Was very glad to see that they are now sold on Amazon, much cheaper than elsewhere.</li>
            <li> , there is a foam insolation liner in the package to keep the cloths warm while you are using the first one,</li>
            <li> The product worked just fine and it achieved the reasons it was purchased.  </li>
            <li> Love these for bed baths or just a quick cleanup.  </li>
            <li> Love this for a comfort, quick cleansing.</li>
            <li> Described accurately, delivered quickly, AAA+++ Dealer, Thank You!</li>
            <li> I was happy to find the same brand available on Amazon.</li>

            <li> These are fantastic and I can&#x27;t imagine not having them.</li>
            <li> But I liked them so much that now I use them sometimes after exercise</li>
            <li> This outfit also makes a waterless hair cleaning system, also available here a at Amazon</li>
            <li> They are great to take along in the RV in case you are short on water or lack of.  </li>
            <li> These are great for my elderly mom to use on a daily basis between showers.</li>
            <li> I found ideal for camping and although you couldn&#x27;t microwave them, I found you can warm them up with warm water either in a closed package or individually.</li>
            <li> They are fantastic.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re fabulous if you can&#x27;t get in a shower or bath for whatever reason.</li>

            <li> Thanks!!!</li>
            <li> They are a great way to clean up in the moring before starting your day and without using a lot of water taking a shower.</li>
            <li> Make sure you heat them up a little for a much more pleasant experience.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ll continue to use them until I can get better, hopefully, and be able to resume my normal shower routine.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> These disposable washcloths are soft, lightly scented, and very refreshing.</li>
            <li> The cloths are so soft and they clean exceptionally well.  </li>
            <li> and I was very satisfied with the complete process</li>
            <li> /&gt;Followup i am so impressed with the thickness of these bathing cloths and with how long they stay wet, so much more than any others that we&#x27;ve used!</li>
            <li> product works well for when you need to get clean and you can&#x27;t shower or bathe</li>
            <li> They make you feel really clean and refreshed.  </li>
            <li> Kept me clean for 4 day hike.  </li>
            <li> I have used them to keep clean in a semi, but I&#x27;m about to have a surgery, and I know they will be helpful to me now.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is not overpowering, you feel clean.</li>
            <li> These were so helpful to keep clean.</li>
            <li> I was a clean freak all my life.</li>
            <li> But I am one clean person.</li>
            <li> so we don&#x27;t have to clean out the stuff we store in the shower every day when we are on the road.  </li>
            <li> so you have a clean body to put in clean cloths.  </li>
            <li> but youll be clean and a lot happier and healthier than if you dont use them.</li>
            <li> and she&#x27;s clean.</li>
            <li> We are one week into the remodeling, and I feel and smell clean.</li>
            <li> I felt refeshed and clean.  </li>
            <li> and I have to clean up in a hurry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t have to rinse, and leave the skin feeling clean and moisturized.</li>
            <li> They clean off the skin without leaving a sticky or soapy type residue.</li>
            <li> All I can say is they make me feel clean.  </li>
            <li> If you have to clean up and can&#x27;t get to a sink or shower, these towelettes will serve you well.  </li>
            <li> Mom says they clean her well and do not cause her to itch.  </li>
            <li> These towelettes are strong and useful.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disabled and this is one good way to stay clean between showers!!</li>
            <li> these are very nice to use  and don&#x27;t dry out my &amp;#34;OLD&amp;#34; skin.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is fresh, clean and light.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;These would be great for a parent on the road with small children, motion sickness, &amp;quot;accidents&amp;quot;, ice cream stickies, all of these things could be quickly dealt with, these are much, much better then a baby wipe, and you have the option of full head to toe clean up without water</li>
            <li> , Shields still have their place, when I need a bit more skin lubrication, but Comfort Bath towels are great for everyday use!  </li>
            <li> I use it on my boat when I don&#x27;t want to bother with a full shower and it works.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve recommended it to friends in the same situation and they have also loved it.  </li>
            <li> My mother-in-law started using them in the hospital and loved them, especially warmed.</li>
            <li> Much thicker than most.  </li>
            <li> I also bought some for myself as I wanted to try them for quick clean ups when I don&#x27;t have time for a shower.</li>
            <li> /&gt;They can&#x27;t be beat for quick clean ups while travelling or camping.  </li>
            <li> I keep a supply on hand at all times to be used for a quick clean and just incase the water supply is stops.  </li>
            <li> EASY CLEAN UP AND REFRESHING WITH NO MESS.</li>
            <li> I used one &amp;#34;set,&amp;#34; for partial washups, and I can see that they would work very nicely for the full bedside bath they&#x27;re designed to provide.  </li>
            <li> These adult washcloths really do the trick - I feel completely clean after using them &amp; buying them in this value size made them fairly cost-efficient.  </li>
            <li> and it leaves me clean and with a fresh aroma.</li>
            <li> and you do feel fresh and clean.  </li>

            <li> are soft and comfortable easy to use, and are great for when someone can&#x27;t get in the bath or shower due to injury or illness.  </li>

            <li> These are great for people who can&#x27;t shower everyday, or if you just went to the gym and want to freshen up.</li>
            <li> My grandma can&#x27;t bath everyday, so these have been a great help.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny.  </li>
            <li> , if you use 2, that&#x27;s 4 days worth.  </li>
            <li> Same used in hospitals &amp; nice warmed in microwave.</li>
            <li> but it is not necessary for them to be effective for a thoroughly cleaned experience.&lt;br /&gt;Sage</li>
            <li> She has been using them cool because it has been hot here, but she was so thankful for them.  </li>
            <li> They left a film or residue on the skin that was kind of tacky.  </li>
            <li> Baby wipes are $2 a pack, and you get $2 of worth of service.</li>

            <li> These cloths can be used right out of the package or heated in the microwave.</li>

            <li> Fantastic product highly recommend these. .</li>
            <li> that the instructions say the eight cloths in a pack equal one \\&quot;bath\\&quot;, but I find four more than adequately cleans me up</li>

            <li> I first used it while in hospital.</li>
            <li> I was first introduced to this while in a hospital, they sent one pack home with me</li>
            <li> OK if you don&#x27;t mind smelling l like &amp;#34;eau de hospital corridor&amp;#34; I bought two units of this to &amp;#34;fight back&amp;#34; against our Water District&#x27;s punitive two month water conservation program, wherein if I don&#x27;t conserve water, my sewer bill will go up for an entire year.</li>
            <li> I think the average user would be very satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> They are really nice to use if you pre-heat for 20 sec.</li>
            <li> These work pretty well.</li>
            <li> I am taking care of an elderly aunt who is no longer able to get into the shower and she loves to bathe with the personal cleansing pads.</li>
            <li> I use them in our First Aide Kit, put some in our guest bath, our bath and in my tote..  </li>
            <li> They are exactly like the ones that the hospital uses.</li>
            <li> I like the fact that they can be used at room temperature or can be warmed in the microwave for a hot bath.</li>
            <li> Exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> I first saw these for use in the hospital.  </li>
            <li> ;) trust.</li>
            <li> PRODUCT WAS EXACTLY AS DESCRIBED.WOULD PURCHASE AGAIN.</li>
            <li> They came promptly and are just like the ones used in the hospital where I first saw them.  </li>
            <li> and I was only able to take 3 showers.  </li>
            <li> I \\&quot;discovered\\&quot; these bath cloths during a recent hospitalization and was pleased to find them on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is the first time I ordered these wash cloths.</li>
            <li> These wipes are great for people with limited ability to use tub or shower, especially when warmed.</li>
            <li> And you really feel clean after using it to take a \\&quot;bath.\\&quot;  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> They are handy for use while traveling and for those who cannot bathe or shower due to illness or disability.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Large, Strong, soft, very moist wipes.  </li>
            <li> These are great disposable wash cloths--nice and thick with plenty of bathing solution--great for older people and care givers!</li>
            <li> But just enough to clean!</li>
            <li> :  They are thick, washcloth type disposable cloths.  Microwaving them for several seconds make them nice and warm.</li>
            <li> Not only does it clean very well but imagine how much money u will save on ur water bill!!</li>
            <li> These are perfect for keeping clean when unable to properly shower or take a bath while recovering from surgery.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re thick, have a pleasant fragrance and get the dirt off my elbows.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll certainly buy then again if/when the need arises and recommend them to anyone who&#x27;s prepping for post-op care.  </li>
            <li> the only thing I strongly recommend is that you warm the little cloths before you use them,</li>
            <li> These wipes are the same wipes the nurses used in the hospital and really make it easy for him to see to his hygiene while I&#x27;m at work.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and leaves the skin soft and smooth,wonderful for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> They are used on an elderly disabled individual in between baths and work great.</li>
            <li> You really feel like you&#x27;ve just bathed or showered.</li>
            <li> and they work really well..</li>
            <li> Need to improve the smell, smells to much like medicine.</li>
            <li> Its much easier for my caregiver.</li>
            <li> They worked very well.</li>
            <li> My mom is using them thanks</li>
            <li> They’re wonderful for emergency cleanups and days when a shower is inconvenient.</li>
            <li> I  have also used comfort bath, &amp; it seems to work very well.</li>
            <li> My husband used these when he couldn&#x27;t get in or out of the tub very well any longer.</li>
            <li> so I have to be there if he wants a real shower for safety.</li>
            <li> My husband did not care for them as much</li>
            <li> She really likes the fact that they can be heated in the microwave.</li>
            <li> The cloths make a bed bath much easier.</li>
            <li> Usually I&#x27;m in a much hotter year-round climate where I always have a package</li>
            <li> These very substantial but disposable washcloths were just what we needed when my sister was recovering from hip replacement surgery.</li>
            <li> This is a quality X10 product, NOT NO cheapo baby wipes which leave a whole lot to be desired.</li>
            <li> This is like a wash cloth and NOT a thin baby wipe.</li>
            <li> SOOOOOOO much easier that dragging out soap, water, washcloth, towel... etc.</li>
            <li> We also use these when we go camping, and they work very well for that.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend these!</li>
            <li> He said they really did the job.</li>
            <li> You feel just as if you had a real bath.  </li>
            <li> , I thought I&#x27;d try these bath wipes, not expecting as much as the Shields.  </li>
            <li> When you have a need for these you really need them.  </li>
            <li> Cloths\\&quot; really came to my rescue.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it unreasonable to expect these people to be trustworthy, ethical.</li>
            <li> Thanks to who ever made this product</li>
            <li> Moistened and ready to use.</li>
            <li> Cleans very well and removes odors.</li>
            <li> For my money, I really like the No Rinse wipes, as they don&#x27;t have the two downsides that I mentioned.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> and she really likes them.  </li>
            <li> This cleans very well.  </li>
            <li> I just keep a few boxes of these wipes handy at all times -</li>
            <li> especially his bottom always gets a yeast infection-so I need disposable soft wash cloths and these are at the top of my list.</li>
            <li> /&gt;+ Thick; holds up well, even with a good amount of scrubbing</li>
            <li> Baby wipes are great for little ones, but they&#x27;re harder to use on an adult with special needs.</li>
            <li> so they don;t fall apart in use and are large enough to clean all the body.  </li>
            <li> Kept me sweet and clean ... and far less drying than soap and hot water!  </li>
            <li> I have tried other brands of the same thing and know good when I have it</li>
            <li> They are also moist enough to clean your whole body with 1 cloth.  </li>
            <li> These can be used several times for that and then clean up the whole bathroom sink area</li>
            <li> They re-seal and keep their moistness even in a hot cabinet, in a hot truck with no air when it sits in the hot sun when we are at home in central Texas.</li>
            <li> they are useful for removing whatever you need to remove and are gentle on the skin.the size is okay for small jobs</li>
            <li> Between a wheelchair 99% of the time and not at all able to shower other than 1% of the time.</li>
            <li> or if I&#x27;m feeling really lazy and don&#x27;t want to shower one day :)!  </li>
            <li> I have used other products that are much better.</li>
            <li> understand why it&#x27;s better to not use alcohol or some other drying agent in the liquid cleaner but</li>
            <li> Better than any other brand I have tried.</li>
            <li> They were essential during my husband&#x27;s recent illness, but also handy for when normal bathing isn&#x27;t practical.</li>
            <li> So much better than normal wet wipes.</li>
            <li> You can even clean them and use them several times if you want because of the quality.</li>
            <li> They are large, thick, easy to use and leave you feeling clean.  </li>
            <li> You warm them in the microwave first which is very comforting for an elderly person who gets cold easily.  </li>
            <li> not only very convenient , but soft on the skin and order free.  </li>
            <li> My skin feels great after I use them, much less dry and very soft.  </li>
            <li> One wipe down and I feel 1000% better.  </li>
            <li> I liked this slightly better for general all over bathing because they seemed to be slightly more moist but preferred the other brand for the private parts because they left less moisture in that area.  </li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product for those of us who are unable to bathe or shower in the traditional ways (catheters, &amp;#34;pjc&amp;#34; lines, etc.).</li>
            <li> Plenty of towelettes in each pack to adequately lather up the entire body.  </li>
            <li> I could have ordered a similar product from a more reliable company and had them three weeks ago and the product I actually received would have been of some use to me.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, and what, in the current state of disgust, is most probable, I will just throw them away to keep from being constantly reminded of how I allowed myself to trust, spend,</li>
            <li> The reason that I only gave it four stars is because when you put it in the microwave to heat it is very hot and a quick minute later it cools off.</li>
            <li> They ship fast, are good quality, and one wipe usually does the trick, as opposed to upwards of 20 baby wipes for the same cleaning.</li>
            <li> Will continue to buy this product and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend shopping with this seller.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend.</li>

            <li> I highly recommended them.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend them for gym and travel.</li>
            <li> Wipes are of high quality</li>
            <li> Highly recommend these.</li>
            <li> I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THESE.</li>
            <li> I can see where these will be handy for lot of other things, once my incision has healed and I&#x27;m back on my feet.  </li>
            <li> They are thick and super wet, plus they smell good.</li>
            <li> These wipes are great to have handy away from home on a hot day or if you work hard and get dirty.  </li>
            <li> Tonight I opened up a package that was four years old and they are still very moist and comforting.  </li>
            <li> But they cost far too much.</li>
            <li> I use these everyday and love them.  </li>
            <li> &amp; I&#x27;ve had increasing trouble getting into it as my rheumatoid arthritis has gotten progressively more disabling.  </li>
            <li> is when I have an open package that wasn&#x27;t correctly resealed and had been sitting over a long period of time (2 weeks or more).  </li>
            <li> These wipes are a nice size, sufficiently moist, and thick, what I thought I&#x27;d like.  </li>
            <li> These cloths are thick and warm in the microwave for patient comfort.</li>
            <li> These are nice and thick.  </li>
            <li> what good is a thin cloth when trying to bathe an elderly person?  </li>
            <li> nice and thick  will purchase agein</li>
            <li> They are nice and thick, and can heat in the microwave.</li>
            <li> I use these for my mother--they are nice and thick.  </li>
            <li> These are super soft, and can be used multiple times</li>
            <li> I bought these right after I had back surgery.</li>
            <li> The Simply Right are 12\\&quot;X8\\&quot;, so they&#x27;re slightly larger than these Comfort 8\\&quot;X8\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> Each towelette will give you plenty of usage compared to other brands that are Mae cheap.</li>
            <li> Wash cloths are thick and stay hot in the insulated bag they are warmed in, staying warm until the entire bath is completed.</li>
            <li> The quality of the cloths is pretty good - they are thick, durable, and aren&#x27;t too rough on the skin.</li>
            <li> The bath wash clothes are very good and help me when I am unable to take a regular shower.</li>
            <li> Stay clean even when Bandages prevent wet bathing.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and had no problem using.  </li>
            <li> But I tried them out of necessity, and I was very surprised and pleased!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t need them to replace a bath but use them between daily baths to  keep sensitive areas as clean as is possible to keep human skin with its own natural flora and constant exposure to possible pathogens.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re also quite thick, so they&#x27;re pretty easy to use.</li>
            <li> They are pretty thick and easy to use.  </li>
            <li> A boon for an old lady with balance problems!</li>
            <li> I love my showers usually twice a day</li>
            <li> I tried many disposable cleaning cloths in the past.  </li>
            <li> My bathroom is so small I can&#x27;t safely give myself a sponge bath there</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I was looking for and my medical supply company no longer carries these.</li>
            <li> Recently, I used a cloth and was surprised at how nice and thick the pad really was.</li>
            <li> We us several of these daily to care for my sensitive skin areas and to clean up a couple of wound beds twice each day.  </li>
            <li> These thick clothes (when heated for a few seconds in the microwave) create a warm comforting bath and leave you feeling clean and refreshed.</li>
            <li> These are a quick, convenient way to bathe with minimal to no water.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Secondly, each cloth is just moist enough - neither too dry, nor too wet.&lt;br /&gt;Thirdly, the cleansing fluid in the product has a very light, clean fragrance - not sweet or flowery, and I was grateful for that.</li>
            <li> My husband graciously helps me bathe since my mobility is so limited right now</li>
            <li> I can sit or lie down and clean my body with no problem.  </li>
            <li> Pop them in the microwave and wipe down to get truly clean without stripping your skin.</li>
            <li> Does the job in getting you clean, but I experienced two problems:  (1)  actually made my skin feel too sticky, grippy and tacky.  </li>
            <li> They left me feeling a little sticky, but were better than using water.</li>
            <li> This product was a great disappointment.</li>
            <li> These washcloths are really hefty and soft at the same time.  </li>
            <li> (pardon me) because I&#x27;m old old old now, poop and pee on myself from time to time.</li>
            <li> my experience with them does not speak well for them, their practice is as far from ethical as it is possible to devolve.</li>
            <li> These are great for those who are unable to bathe on a regular basis.  </li>
            <li> I have used them in caring for my family and professionally.</li>
            <li> They are big, and holds a lot of soap, it&#x27;s not too much where it will be dripping all over.</li>
            <li> Leaves the skin soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li> Was pleasantly surprised that it cleanses well.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a product similar to this before on hunting trips,&amp; really appreciated it.</li>
            <li> Add a teaspoon of water and pop in the microwave for a much more comfortable bathing experience for your ill relative.</li>
            <li> My skin feels soft and refreshed.  </li>
            <li> so I was pleasantly surprised that these do the job.</li>
            <li> WOW...</li>
            <li> This feels really soft against the body.  </li>
            <li> Having automatically discarded the shipping materials when they arrived I can&#x27;t return them and am left with towelettes I might be able to wet and use for the dog if adding water will actually soften them.</li>
            <li> You have to be careful not to overheat them in the microwave because you could burn yourself and also make sure the are opened enough to stay open when heating or soap and moisture will bubble up out into your oven.  </li>
            <li> They really are quite thick and filled with a soothing cleanser.  </li>
            <li> THe size is easy to use, the cloths are thick and don&#x27;t shred, they warm up in the microwave, and they are small enough to carry along in a purse/tote.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> We read a small study in which high school wrestlers did this, and the group that used these had significantly fewer skin infections.</li>
            <li> These large, thick and moist wipes leave you feeling clean and refreshed.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t get around easily and my bathroom is too small for walkers or wheel chairs.</li>
            <li> I ordered these due to having foot surgery and not being able to get the dressings wet.</li>
            <li> so a quick wipe down</li>
            <li> No mess and work well</li>
            <li> No mess, I bath her once or twice a day  with them</li>
            <li> No fuss, no mess, just heat in microwave and use to give myself a sponge bath.</li>
            <li> My only wish is that each cloth was a bit larger, but that is just a personal preference because the size is adequate.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Having recently gone through a total knee replacement, I stocked up on these to get through the first couple of weeks while my mobility was questionable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend this to anyone that could use some extra help with bathing.  </li>
            <li> Both are great products and saved the day for me during this very difficult time.</li>
            <li> The towels are thick and soft, the scent is kind of odd though, not really fresh or clean smelling.</li>
            <li> These large thick disposable washcloths are so useful to have on hand.  </li>
            <li> I can only surmise that, as other customers have experienced, these are outdated items.  </li>
            <li> They are thick and treated with aloe and other non-irritating ingredients to help you clean quickly and leave you feeling refreshed.  </li>
            <li> Great item especially because it can be heated in the microwave, so it wont be cold.</li>
            <li> They also wash and dry very we;; and can be used over and over.</li>
            <li> Comfort Bath personal cleansing is very convenient for a frail person like me with the relative ease of scrubbing with the cloths.</li>
            <li> I purchased this Comfort Bath Personal Cleaning Ultra thick wash cloths  for a dear friend whose husband has Dementia and has to be taken care of,cleaned up many times a day.</li>
            <li> This were so strong and thick.</li>
            <li> Simply Right brand, which arrived more dry than wet and weren&#x27;t as thick.  </li>
            <li> this product keeps me clean with very little hassle.  </li>
            <li> These cloths are nice and thick they do not tear as you wipe them over your skin which has been my experience with other brands of disposable washcloths.  </li>
            <li> My disabled wife uses them to keep clean on the days when it is not possible to shower do to spikes in pain.</li>
            <li> I am unable to take showers and this product leaves me feeling as clean and fresh as if I&#x27;ve showered.  </li>
            <li> However, they are smaller (albeit thicker) than Simply Right Adult Washcloths and seem to leave a slight residue.</li>
            <li> these are thick and large and really get the job done!  </li>
            <li> Perfect for my 90 year old Mom during the cold winter months!!</li>
            <li> They work well and they are soft and last.</li>
            <li> Totally made the days post surgery where showering and baths weren&#x27;t an option far easier to tolerate when I could get someone to help me use these cloths to cleanse myself.  </li>
            <li> Bare foot gal.</li>
            <li> She won&#x27;t tolerate coarse materials on her sensitive areas either.  </li>
            <li> The cloths are moist with no rinse soap solution and thick, not thin like the cloth wet wipes ubiquitously available in stores.</li>
            <li> The bath washcloths are nice but, just too expensive.  </li>
            <li> Nurse tells me these are so much better than the paper thin &amp;#</li>
            <li> They do dry my skin out a little bit but that is a minor issue compared to not being able to shower.  </li>
            <li> Just okay..not as thick as I expected and went through them pretty quickly .</li>
            <li> I wish they were a little thinner but a little bigger and packed in individual wrappers, but they will do nicely.</li>
            <li> My only complaint about this product is that it cools off very quickly.  </li>
            <li> No, you don&#x27;t feel as clean as you do with a shower, but you will feel cleaner than with any other rinseless wipe (can&#x27;t remember all the brands I have tried as I&#x27;ve been using the Comfort Bath wipes for a number of years).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the only time I have found wipes dry in the package</li>
            <li> my daughter who gets her feet really dirty playing outside can use these quickly and easily instead of taking a shower.</li>
            <li> They have a very faint, pleasant scent, and leave no residue on the skin.</li>
            <li> Soft, fluffy, large.</li>
            <li> Could be a little moister but nice and thick and can be heated in microwave before use.</li>
            <li> With my extra sensitive skin it is absolutely necessary to get all residue from both medicine and adhesive off, and these do without having to scrub.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> These are very nice to have when you have a sick person at home.  </li>
            <li> Following major surgery, I used these disposable cleansing cloths in the hospital.</li>
            <li> This is my first purchase from Amazon; I previously purchased them at a local drugstore.  </li>
            <li> I first used this product as a hospital patient a few yeas ago.</li>
            <li> My adult some who has sever disabilities and is total care is difficult to bathe more than once a week in the bath tub.  </li>
            <li> These are the ones that are thick, durable, and full of suds.  </li>
            <li> If I just plan to use one or two towels only I remove one towel at a time and run a little hot water on it.</li>
            <li> Dispose of in Trash NOT Toilet!</li>
            <li> Subtle clean fragrance.  </li>
            <li> The wipes are really thick, so you go through them quite quickly.  </li>
            <li> I find these very convenient for a quick way to refresh when unable to use a regular shower.</li>
            <li> These are a Godsend on days when I am too stiff or in too much pain to move.</li>
            <li> These are like a thick cotton wash cloths that are very large.</li>
            <li> The cost is a little on the high side</li>
            <li> Price a little high</li>
            <li> These are SUPER thick and really work well to allow you to SCRUB yourself hard and get out that dug in dust.</li>
            <li> /&gt;These work very well and go a long way to making a sick or convalescing person feel much more human.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you or a family member are pretty much bed bound or unable to get into a bath or shower.  </li>
            <li> I purchased the personal cleansing cloths because my husband had just had minor back surgery.</li>
            <li> Got these for my wife following her surgery and long recovery.</li>
            <li> Toooo expensive, too few in the package,  and leave a kind of sticky feeling on your skin.</li>
            <li> No residue left on the skin, no oiliness, doesn&#x27;t dry out the skin.  </li>
            <li> Half of them were completely dried-out</li>
            <li> They are so similar to what I used at the hospital that it would have been crazy to pay more.</li>
            <li> when I have trouble on bad days, low oxygen, I am on oxygen 24/7, and with these I can still clean up nicely, feeling clean and refreshed when I could not bathe otherwise on bad days,</li>
            <li> /&gt;They may be more expensive than some of the other brands, but for my money, these are the best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have tested this brand and the No Rinse brand of body cleansing pads for the last 3 months due to an inability to take showers due to major reconstructive foot surgery.</li>
            <li> I have a very rare genetic disorder that has worsened, leaving me homebound and very weak.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t know why they aren&#x27;t commonly found in drug stores.</li>
            <li> We use these when camping or travelling in one of our campers when we are not near a shower.  </li>
            <li> They do leave a bit of sticky residue in places like my armpit and elbow joint, so I rinse with a regular wet wash cloth.</li>
            <li> They have a long shelf life, too.  </li>
            <li> Have used this product for a long time and it works well.  </li>
            <li> No you don&#x27;t get a long relaxing bath</li>
            <li> Now if youre driving long hauls and you dont want to go days without a shower or bath here is your solution.</li>
            <li> One cloth will go a long way.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this product for my travels in the remote villages of rural Ethiopia.  </li>
            <li> I have pretty sensitive skin and some irritation issues, so I was a bit skeptical.  </li>
            <li> They are thick and wet--and don&#x27;t really need to be followed with a rinse.</li>
            <li> These cloths were very plush and thick.</li>
            <li> I guess that I&#x27;m not large enough to use 8 sheets as 3-4</li>
            <li> wait, only to have to subject myself to the same process all over again with another</li>
            <li> I had bought some at the drug store but those was very thin and cheap, got these</li>
            <li> They are expensive, but after a long hike or fishing trip where there are no shower facilities, I feel clean when I get into the sleeping bag.</li>
            <li> Due to a recent surgery, my husband is not allowed to shower.</li>
            <li> She is familiar with hospital stays, unfortunately.  </li>
            <li> Though the product page indicates they are for people who have difficulty bathing due to illness or injury, they can be used by anybody any time you need to freshen up but taking a bath or shower just isn&#x27;t possible.</li>
            <li> Due to disabilities I can only use the shower when thoroughly rested, so have to depend on wipes between times.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m debating trying them again from a different merchant or buying the other brand.  </li>
            <li> trying other brands that cost far less.</li>
            <li> It has taken a very long time to recover from the itching.</li>
            <li> I had a buddy who used to be in the Army and he told.me they used these things down range when they can be out there a week or so and workin pretty hard.</li>
            <li> These were too dry...</li>
            <li> Others can be too dry or smell medicinal.</li>
            <li> these are  a dry wipes</li>
            <li> For any situation that requires being as clean as a shower while unable to shower these are the answer.  </li>
            <li> not leave your skin dry</li>
            <li> clean.&lt;br /&gt;Often when we dry camp in our motorhome we have used diaper wipes for washing up between showers.</li>
            <li> Had a multiple fracture, dislocation of my wrist, and extensive surgery putting me in a heavy cast/sling.  </li>
            <li> If I were aged, infirm and had lost my olfactory sense, I might think differently - - as it is I am only aged.</li>
            <li> I ordered them for my up coming surgery, a weekend trip to an island off the coast of NH where showering is limited.  </li>
            <li> and so I&#x27;ve got limited mobility for a while.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s difficult for me to take a full shower, so I use these to take a sponge bath on the days in between.  </li>
            <li> I use one for my face, one for my upper body and one for the lower half.</li>
            <li> Even if you only use half per bath</li>
            <li> These are not frivolous purchases or items for the lazy or slothful, these are medical supplies produced by companies whose business is the production of medical devices and supplies.</li>
            <li> Tough to bathe everynight, so every other night I just do a quick wipe down.  </li>
            <li> Very soft and thick.</li>
            <li> They can be heated in the microwave, and my husband reports that they are very thick and large (unlike Baby Wipes).</li>
            <li> My grandson requested baby wipes to be sent for his deployment to Afghanistan, and was looking for something a little bigger for him.  </li>
            <li> Warm in the microwave or use cold if you are tough enough.  </li>
            <li> I was shocked to discover gray spots on the surface of the top cloth, even though it was stored in an air conditioned room.  </li>
            <li> We still have quite a few left as well...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used these for over 16 years since I am disabled &amp; sometimes not well enough to take a shower.  </li>
            <li> I could not get wet...</li>
            <li> I put them in the microwave for 30 sec</li>
            <li> After a total joint replacement, I had difficulty showering everyday.  </li>
            <li> I expected to have to dampen them a bit, but there was no mosture loss.  </li>
            <li> I received, September 6, a box of dried out, coarse paper towels.</li>
            <li> it is what I expected</li>
            <li> The cloths are thick and soft.  </li>
            <li> I only use one thick cloth over my entire body; I don&#x27;t use separate cloths for every body part -</li>
            <li> There are are eight thick washcloths in each packet intended to do one adult</li>
            <li> Wipes are thick and soft.</li>
            <li> The cloths are moist, thick and soft; they worked well on cleaning me up and leaving me refreshed.  </li>
            <li> They are thick and soft and durable.</li>
            <li> i could not fine the bath cloths at my local pharmacey so ordered them from amazon, they smelled terrable.</li>
            <li> After I got out I tried a few other types, but came back to these.</li>
            <li> you are definitely clean after using this stuff, just check out the dirty wipes after you&#x27;re done.</li>
            <li> but if you only need them for a little while I say get them!</li>
            <li> But other then that I will continue to buy just for the convience.</li>
            <li> These make you feel cleaner than using the baby wipes and the other over the counter wipes.</li>
            <li> We first got the idea of using these when my Mother-In-Law was ill and bed-ridden.</li>
            <li> But were thicker then some of the other ones i purchased  from other places.</li>
            <li> For the times you can&#x27;t get the person into a bath due to surgery or for the times of upset tummy.</li>
            <li> Every other brand are just flimsy wipes masquerading as disposable washclothes.  </li>
            <li> with my wife&#x27;s hip replacement we found at first it was difficult to get in our bath tub/shower, so</li>
            <li> Probably some other instances that I can&#x27;t think of too.</li>
            <li> If I was traveling with small children I would definitely have a supply of these on hand.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m recommending these to other friends getting surgery.</li>
            <li> Use routinely at home every other day.&lt;br /&gt;Saves water in drought stricken California.</li>
            <li> I first discovered them while caring for my Mother and bathing was extremely difficult.  </li>
            <li> this product allowed me to cleanse the other areas of my body without getting my legs wet or cleansing with wet and messy sponge baths.</li>
            <li> Comfort Personal Cleansing Shield Incontinence Care Washcloths 32 ea]] to protect \\&quot;delicate</li>
            <li> Rite aid no longers carries this style of personal thick disposable wash clothes.  </li>
            <li> The only complaint is the cleaning agent leaves a slight &amp;#34;film&amp;#34; on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Our sons use these to wipe down after every wrestling match when they go to tournaments.</li>
            <li> these in the hospital, bought&lt;br /&gt;these to wash down while recovering</li>
            <li> They made such a difference as she wasn&#x27;t ab;e to take her usual bath for weeks!</li>
            <li> will keep a box with me though, for when I visit relatives that only have one bathroom and lots of family staying there - no more waiting hours to shower!</li>
            <li> After a bad fall and hospitalization, this helped me feel fresh when I couldn&#x27;t shower every single day.</li>
            <li> is so important for someone like me who is too sick now to shower or take a bath, but needs the dignity of not having to be bathed by someone else.&lt;br /&gt;As</li>
            <li> The past few packs that I have opened, the seal doesnt open properly which makes them difficult to open and heat up.</li>
            <li> My husband has COPD &amp; emphysema, he has had 2 collapsed lungs this year and was in the hospital for a month and a half.</li>
            <li> I was given these personal cleansing cloths during a recent hospitalization, since I was too ill to shower.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The package wasn&#x27;t but about half used</li>
            <li> I wish the manufacturer&#x27;s of these wipes would come up with something that smelled less like a powder room or medicine.  </li>
            <li> Sometimes I cut them in half so as not to waste.</li>
            <li> Despite the fact that the Sam&#x27;s Club brand is dry and not as thick as Comfort Bath, I prefer the Sam&#x27;s Club.  </li>
            <li> I have tried a number of different rinseless wipes in the past, but none have ever been either as moist or as thick as the Comfort Bath wipes.  </li>
            <li> but after sweat, you might feel a little sticky... that will subside.</li>
            <li> so the bath system does the job, but for the little girl in a, brother dumped an ice cream cone on the head disaster</li>
            <li> These aren&#x27;t the little wipes like you buy at the grocery.</li>
            <li> These are ok...seem a little sticky on the skin.</li>
            <li> I am elderly and became wheel chair bound and a daily shower is too tough</li>
            <li> I use these for my autistic son who had a phobia of water.</li>
            <li> I spent a few weeks with open wounds on my legs and was unable to shower or bathe...</li>
            <li> Heavy duty</li>
            <li> We left no trash behind.</li>
            <li> Gift for my sister who has broken her leg in several places and is not mobile.</li>
            <li> Use this product everyday with my mother who is 84 years.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used them a few times since for traveling and camping and fieldwork.  </li>
            <li> it is a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I regret the time wasted.</li>
            <li> and although I shower every day, I have trouble reaching and washing my feet.  </li>
            <li> They are heavy duty</li>
            <li> ordered these wipes for my father, But they are useless, these are dry dry wipes</li>
            <li> It is hard for him to shower due to the moisture in the air making it hard to breathe.</li>
            <li> A must for bathing those who are unable to tolerate a regular bath/shower.</li>
            <li> I guess I hit something wrong, purchased recently,</li>
            <li> Everyone needs to keep a few of these on hand!  </li>
            <li> Because they are thick and moist you didn&#x27;t have to worry about missing anything.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m recovering from back surgery, so showers are difficult.  </li>
            <li> I recently had knee surgery and was unable to shower for a couple of weeks.  </li>
            <li> I have in the past.</li>
            <li> I was unable to shower for several weeks after surgery.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;You definitely shouldn&#x27;t go wrong with the Comfort Bath wipes.  </li>
            <li> have used other brands (teeny and thin) and the liquid no-rinse soaps, but am sold on Comfort Bath.  </li>
            <li> these were a big disappointment and waste of money.  </li>
            <li> I am recovering from major surgery and desperately needed an atternative to bathing for an extended time.</li>
            <li> Sadly, after trying one, I need a long shower to get rid of  the medicinal smell.</li>
            <li> They have a slight smell, not to bad, it doesn&#x27;t last.</li>
            <li> I have purchased this product before for  my mother who had a stroke and has a hard time in the shower.</li>
            <li> I could not set foot in a shower for at least 3 weeks.  </li>
            <li> They are thick.</li>
            <li> The cloths are thick and hold up well.</li>
            <li> These wipes are thick</li>
            <li> Thick</li>
            <li> They were moist and thick.  </li>
            <li> My father is unable to ambulate due to lung cancer which has spread to the hip.</li>
            <li> There is not even a whiff of bad orders left after you wash.  </li>
            <li> surgery and bathing would be difficult for a few days.  </li>
            <li> Not a good situation.  </li>
            <li> We utilize these on our truck when we don&#x27;t have a chance to take a shower and we are feeling pretty nasty!</li>
            <li> My mom is elderly and bathing is a tough area she doesnt like.</li>
            <li> They work well and are very thick.</li>
            <li> that is unnecessary and wasteful in my opinion.</li>
            <li> mom is over ninety, I use them for her when she is to tired to shower.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got MS and it is exhausting and difficult to get in the shower.  </li>
            <li> I did not detect any bad or &#x27;medicinal&#x27; odor, which others complained of.</li>
            <li> When our father broke his foot and was unable to take a shower, we heated one of these cloths in the mircowave for about 40 secs.</li>
            <li> However they are expensive for the amount supplied.</li>
            <li> I knew what these were like as the hospital gave us some when my husband was too ill to take showers.  </li>
            <li> Just too expensive  </li>
            <li> They are quite expensive though.</li>
            <li> I was unable to walk and needed a way to freshen up in between sponge baths.</li>
            <li> I used these washcloths after spine surgery four years ago as I was in a body cast and unable to shower for three months.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong (2 weeks in and still 2 weeks to go)</li>
            <li> It is of my opinion that you can&#x27;t go wrong with this product..</li>
            <li> I am unable to bath myself.</li>
            <li> Sister uses this product when my elderly mom is unable to take a shower.</li>
            <li> and it will be a cold recovery in the winter in CA.</li>
            <li> it is dangerous for me to enter and exit the tub.</li>
            <li> My biggest disappointment is the size.</li>
            <li> boy was I wrong!</li>
            <li> /&gt;A must have for the sick patient - the time when a bath or shower is either impossible or too tiring.</li>
            <li> Microwaving provides soothing and comforting warmth to sore feet and painful joints.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for a sick friend who praises this product and looks forward to buying some for himself.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t hate it.</li>
            <li> Purchased for a friend going through chemo and having some very bad days.</li>
            <li> (I guess I could&#x27;ve added water to use them, but the fragrance was horrible....).</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is a wonderful product for those of us who are unable to bathe or shower in the traditional ways (catheters, &amp;#34;pjc&amp;#34; lines, etc.). I&#x27;ve used this product *many* times in the hospital and it leaves me clean and with a fresh aroma.</li>
            <li> My disabled wife uses them to keep clean on the days when it is not possible to shower do to spikes in pain. Excellent product.</li>
            <li> They are a life saver if you cannot shower after surgery. They do the job really well, surprisingly.</li>
            <li> We needed this product when my husband couldn&#x27;t get into the shower after surgery. It is something that we will definitely recommend to others.</li>
            <li> These are so helpful..for a handicapped person like myself..&lt;br /&gt;My skin dries out very quickly if i shower every day...these are very nice to use  and don&#x27;t dry out my &amp;#34;OLD&amp;#34; skin.</li>
            <li> Following major surgery, I used these disposable cleansing cloths in the hospital. I was happy to find the same brand available on Amazon. When you hurt too much to get in the tub or shower, these are a nice alternative. They do a good job and don&#x27;t leave any soapy residue on your skin. It makes you feel better when you feel nice and clean. Great product!</li>
            <li> These are excellent cleansing washcloths for use on those who can&#x27;t take care of themselves. The cloths are moist with no rinse soap solution and thick, not thin like the cloth wet wipes ubiquitously available in stores. The thickness is the key-- holds the soap solution and doesn&#x27;t bunch up while in use. This item is available at Walmart when they have it in stock ( Comfort Bath by Sage Products) but I&#x27;ve experienced problems getting them to keep them in stock.I purchased this item here on Amazon for basically the same price I paid at Walmart except this was delivered to my door.</li>
            <li> These are a quick, convenient way to bathe with minimal to no water. Cleans every part of your body as well as a bubble bath. In emergencies, car breakdowns, or more  medical independency everyone should have a suppy. Also a must have in your car&#x27;s emergency kit!</li>
            <li> I have been purchasing these for my invalid mother. They are great because I can give her a warm quick wash up when needed. The past few packs that I have opened, the seal doesnt open properly which makes them difficult to open and heat up. But other then that I will continue to buy just for the convience.</li>
            <li> I first used this product as a hospital patient a few yeas ago. I was very pleased to be able to purchase it now for home use. I find these very convenient for a quick way to refresh when unable to use a regular shower. It has been hot and humid here this summer, and these wipes have been very handy. I&#x27;ve also purchased them for my elderly mother who has difficulty getting into and out of the tub. They allow her to freshen up safely.</li>
            <li> A must for bathing those who are unable to tolerate a regular bath/shower. I have used them in caring for my family and professionally.</li>
            <li> I am having surgery, and will not be able to take a shower for 6 weeks,  I have used these in the past, and they are great, They are not sticky, and leave the skin smooth and fresh.</li>
            <li> Excellent product and excellent price</li>
            <li> Although these washcloths are intended for bed baths, they are also a quick and convenient way to clean up quickly after a workout, especially if you don&#x27;t have time for a shower.</li>
            <li> It says I can&#x27;t leave feedback I guess I hit something wrong, purchased recently, and I am very pleased with this product. It is a great help to me when I have trouble on bad days, low oxygen, I am on oxygen 24/7, and with these I can still clean up nicely, feeling clean and refreshed when I could not bathe otherwise on bad days, has helped me out greatly. A great product. They use the rinseless soaps in the hospital now so I am very comfortable using them since I discovered them during my last hospital stay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Followup i am so impressed with the thickness of these bathing cloths and with how long they stay wet, so much more than any others that we&#x27;ve used! Very high quality item Thank You!</li>
            <li> These were too dry...</li>
            <li> I use these for my autistic son who had a phobia of water. They are wonderful have a great smell and I doo recommend them to everyone.</li>
            <li> Everyone needs to keep a few of these on hand!  Traveling can take the energy out of anyone and these jewels are great if you don&#x27;t feel like taking a shower/bath.  They are great for disabled folks when traveling where there aren&#x27;t bars or a roll in shower.  They are great for older folks who worry about losing their balance!  They are also great if you are at home and lose power!  So many uses :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m hooked and will probably be ordering more!</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  Nice large size, moist, and pleasant but not strong fragrance.  I always keep it on hand.</li>
            <li> I purchased these to get me through not being able to shower after surgery.  I love them.  The wipes stay warm, they are are soft, the scent is very pleasant.  They do dry my skin out a little bit but that is a minor issue compared to not being able to shower.  My husband graciously helps me bathe since my mobility is so limited right now and he agrees that the product is much better than what he was planning on doing to help me bathe - a damp washcloth and sudsy water in the sink.  Please give them a try if you are recuperating.  They are very pleasant!</li>
            <li> Very valuable to me! I&#x27;m disabled and this is one good way to stay clean between showers!!</li>
            <li> They come in handy when your out an about and need to refresh</li>
            <li> They left me feeling a little sticky, but were better than using water. I did however wipe off with a damp washcloth after using them.</li>
            <li> Great product for cleaning fast and it removes underarm oder as well. I use it on my boat when I don&#x27;t want to bother with a full shower and it works. I first used it while in hospital.</li>
            <li> This product warms up nice in a microwave and provides a great bath for my bed-bound mother. Wash cloths are thick and stay hot in the insulated bag they are warmed in, staying warm until the entire bath is completed. Will continue to buy this product and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> A godsend.  Had a multiple fracture, dislocation of my wrist, and extensive surgery putting me in a heavy cast/sling.  They use these in the hospital.  Not being able to shower for 2 mos .. they are a delight.  Subtle clean fragrance.  I was so happy to find them in multiple packaging on AMAZON!!  Saved the day!  Kept me sweet and clean ... and far less drying than soap and hot water!  Worth every penny.  8 per pack, if you use 2, that&#x27;s 4 days worth.  Heat them up in microwave, then toss in garbage after use.</li>
            <li> These washcloths are really hefty and soft at the same time.  They are used on an elderly disabled individual in between baths and work great.</li>
            <li> These disposable washcloths are dependable and strong. When our father broke his foot and was unable to take a shower, we heated one of these cloths in the mircowave for about 40 secs. to wash his back and arms.  The cost is a little on the high side but they are easy to use and are made of very good quality. The cloths are also great for older seniors who have physical restrictions.</li>
            <li> I was first introduced to this while in a hospital, they sent one pack home with me and I remember being thankful for it. When you&#x27;re not feeling well, it beats sitting by the sink or tub with a semi-cold damp wash cloth and bar of soap. I love everything about this item; it&#x27;s efficient, clean, ability to warm in microwave and hold the warmth, disposable... I&#x27;m happy to be ordering it online now for a friend about to go through major surgery.</li>
            <li> I had a strong allergic reaction to the use of this product.  Maybe it wouldn&#x27;t affect everyone this way, but I suggest being cautious about purchasing these \\&quot;cloths\\&quot; for bathing.  The cost to return them is prohibitive because they weigh a lot, so I&#x27;ll be throwing them away.  It has taken a very long time to recover from the itching.</li>
            <li> product works well for when you need to get clean and you can&#x27;t shower or bathe, I is good that you don&#x27;t have to rinse.</li>
            <li> These are the largest and thickest clothes of this kind!  I used these in the hospital as a nurse and used them last year when I had to wear an orthopedic boot on my ankle for 6 weeks.  We also use them with my Mother for incontinence care.  Now I sometimes use them if I don&#x27;t feel like taking a shower in the morning.  They make you feel really clean and refreshed.  And they are excellent to take camping! You really feel like you&#x27;ve just bathed or showered.</li>
            <li> We utilize these on our truck when we don&#x27;t have a chance to take a shower and we are feeling pretty nasty! They work well and are very thick. They re-seal and keep their moistness even in a hot cabinet, in a hot truck with no air when it sits in the hot sun when we are at home in central Texas. These wipes can also be heated up in the microwave so you can have a warm cleansing feeling if you want. I got the case so I wouldn&#x27;t have to purchase them so often, and so I can have some on hand at home for that just in case moment when you want to conserve water, but you want to feel clean, this is a great alternative. These make you feel cleaner than using the baby wipes and the other over the counter wipes. We first got the idea of using these when my Mother-In-Law was ill and bed-ridden. A wonderful item all around!</li>
            <li> Great stuff for the in firmed or temporarily out of it as I was during a shoulder replacement. These came in very very handy...no puns!</li>
            <li> These cloths are perfect for cleansing any time you don&#x27;t have access to a bath or shower, not just for the bedridden. I have friends who like to go for a run during lunch hour and use these clothes to freshen up. I have used them to cleanse my  husband&lt;br /&gt;after surgery, before showers are permitted and to the my totally bedridden grandmother. I really don&#x27;t know why they aren&#x27;t commonly found in drug stores.</li>
            <li> A boon for an old lady with balance problems! I do have a CNA who helps me shower, but in between I keep clean and nice smelling on my own with these bath wipes.  I&#x27;ve used them now for ten years.</li>
            <li> Easy and effective. Great product</li>
            <li> These are perfect for keeping clean when unable to properly shower or take a bath while recovering from surgery. Here are my observations:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;+ Thick; holds up well, even with a good amount of scrubbing&lt;br /&gt;+ Microwavable; adds to comfort&lt;br /&gt;+ Refreshing; these leave me feeling very clean and much better smelling&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note that the instructions say the eight cloths in a pack equal one \\&quot;bath\\&quot;, but I find four more than adequately cleans me up nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These work very well and go a long way to making a sick or convalescing person feel much more human.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly Recommended! I also recommended [[ASIN:B000NNJUNW Comfort Personal Cleansing Shield Incontinence Care Washcloths 32 ea]] to protect \\&quot;delicate areas\\&quot; of those who are bedridden.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CFH</li>
            <li> Kept me clean for 4 day hike.  Wipe and toss.  Simple.... but after sweat, you might feel a little sticky... that will subside.</li>
            <li> Product is just what my husband was looking for. Very happy and they work really well..</li>
            <li> Delivery was great! Love the product and recommend it to all who need them. Very happy with this purchase!</li>
            <li> I love these bath cloths. I used them after surgery to stay freshened up. They are thick. Sometimes I cut them in half so as not to waste. I didn&#x27;t have to warm them. I just used right from the pack. This 4 pack last 1 week through daily baths and toileting.  Very good buy</li>
            <li> Soft, fluffy, large. Use at pool sometimes</li>
            <li> My mother was given some of these during a recent stint in a rehab facility. When she came home she was hooked on them. The only thing that could be improved on is if they were flushable. All in all though my sister and I are happy with the size, thickness and ease of cleaning her up with these rinse free wipes.</li>
            <li> I get them for my elderly aunt. She loves them. It is her preferred way to bathe.</li>
            <li> My mom loves these!! They are big, and holds a lot of soap, it&#x27;s not too much where it will be dripping all over. But just enough to clean! They have a slight smell, not to bad, it doesn&#x27;t last. These are great for people who can&#x27;t shower everyday, or if you just went to the gym and want to freshen up. Packs are pretty small you could slide in your purse.</li>
            <li> I use these everyday and love them.  I have tried many but none compare to the quality of these.  They also wash and dry very we;; and can be used over and over.</li>
            <li> OK if you don&#x27;t mind smelling l like &amp;#34;eau de hospital corridor&amp;#34; I bought two units of this to &amp;#34;fight back&amp;#34; against our Water District&#x27;s punitive two month water conservation program, wherein if I don&#x27;t conserve water, my sewer bill will go up for an entire year. I envisioned using these as an occasional freshener. Sadly, after trying one, I need a long shower to get rid of  the medicinal smell. If I were aged, infirm and had lost my olfactory sense, I might think differently - - as it is I am only aged.</li>
            <li> Fabulous and excellent pricing.....especially helpful after surgery when bathing is not an option.  I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Great product to do personal cleaning.  Can use right out of the package or microwave to warm it.</li>
            <li> Best body cleansing product ever. Leaves the skin soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li> Just okay..not as thick as I expected and went through them pretty quickly . Probably will not purchase these again</li>
            <li> Good product easy to use, have used them before and been happy with them.</li>
            <li> Lightly scented, not overpowering.  Was pleasantly surprised that it cleanses well.  Cloths are sized generously.</li>
            <li> My father is unable to ambulate due to lung cancer which has spread to the hip. He has always been incredibly neat and dignified, so going without bathing is hard for him. My mother says these are making him feel more like himself.</li>
            <li> This is a great product, and the seller was very good too. I have used them to keep clean in a semi, but I&#x27;m about to have a surgery, and I know they will be helpful to me now. Thank you !</li>
            <li> This is a very good product.  I have tried other brands of the same thing and know good when I have it and this is it! The wipes are very moist and have a pleasant smell. Others can be too dry or smell medicinal. Not so with these.  I think the average user would be very satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> The bath wash clothes are very good and help me when I am unable to take a regular shower. I was happy that the product was as advertised and came in a timely manner.</li>
            <li> Same used in hospitals &amp; nice warmed in microwave. However they are expensive for the amount supplied. Worked for me.</li>
            <li> Due to a recent surgery, my husband is not allowed to shower. These wipes are wonderful !!  Just warm in the microwave, no rinsing needed, you feel GREAT. !!</li>
            <li> Toooo expensive, too few in the package,  and leave a kind of sticky feeling on your skin. Better to use a washcloth, warm water and soap.</li>
            <li> I spent a few weeks with open wounds on my legs and was unable to shower or bathe...this product allowed me to cleanse the other areas of my body without getting my legs wet or cleansing with wet and messy sponge baths. Works perfectly! Felt refreshed and clean!</li>
            <li> I purchased the personal cleansing cloths because my husband had just had minor back surgery. I used the cloths to wash his back and they worked well.  Since then, I have taken packages of the cloths on trips and found them to be a great way to wash while traveling.  Also, they are really handy when I am at home, in a hurry and want to freshen up fast.  All in all, a very handy item to have at home and away.  They are really nice to use if you pre-heat for 20 sec. in the microwave.  My only wish is that each cloth was a bit larger, but that is just a personal preference because the size is adequate.</li>
            <li> These wipes are great to have handy away from home on a hot day or if you work hard and get dirty.  They&#x27;re thick, have a pleasant fragrance and get the dirt off my elbows.</li>
            <li> Great works well,cleans and freshens nicely.</li>
            <li> This product is like what I used in the hospital, I believe the same brand. I cannot always take a regular shower and these allow me to freshen up. I warm them up in a 1200 watt microwave for 50 seconds.</li>
            <li> i could not fine the bath cloths at my local pharmacey so ordered them from amazon, they smelled terrable. But were thicker then some of the other ones i purchased  from other places. Need to improve the smell, smells to much like medicine.</li>
            <li> Great item especially because it can be heated in the microwave, so it wont be cold. Pleasent smelling  also nice!</li>
            <li> Soooooooooo perfect disposal washcloth. The thickness and softness of the bath cloth leaves you feeling euphoric, like you were bathed with cashmere.</li>
            <li> Thought this would be better for an elder person that has mobility issues.  Decided they&#x27;d prefer the thinner material.  If you want a thicker cloth, this works.</li>
            <li> I used these for camping in the desert and they were great. I felt refreshed and clean after a morning \\&quot;bath\\&quot; and they were great for taking the dust off at the end of the day. The cloths are sturdy and moist.</li>
            <li> These are the best personal towelett&#x27;s I&#x27;ve found</li>
            <li> These pads have worked great with no problems.I am handicapped and at times I have to be bathed in bed.Its much easier for my caregiver.I will continue purchasing them.</li>
            <li> These work pretty well. Heavy duty and are a nice option if you can&#x27;t bath or shower. They worked very well.</li>
            <li> The wipes are really thick, so you go through them quite quickly.  It does do it&#x27;s job, however so I don&#x27;t hate it.</li>
            <li> I knew what these were like as the hospital gave us some when my husband was too ill to take showers.  Microwave and they are great.  Now my mother-in-law and I were using them when our local water was under a boil alert with warnings not to use the water for bathing.  They are a great little pkg of cleaning cloths for emergencies.</li>
            <li> these are  a dry wipes&lt;br /&gt;I ordered these wipes for my father, But they are useless, these are dry dry wipes</li>
            <li> My mom is using them thanks</li>
            <li> Good product. It&#x27;s a big help to anyone post-surgery or having mobility problems.&lt;br /&gt;Have used this off and on since 2008 surgery.</li>
            <li> For the times you can&#x27;t get the person into a bath due to surgery or for the times of upset tummy. Does not cause a rash</li>
            <li> I am unable to take showers and this product leaves me feeling as clean and fresh as if I&#x27;ve showered.  I can sit or lie down and clean my body with no problem.  They are great and I will be ordering more.</li>
            <li> The bath washcloths are nice but, just too expensive.  Directions say to use a separate washcloth for each body part.  That&#x27;s eight washcloths per day--an entire package.  Just too expensive  trying other brands that cost far less.</li>
            <li> I used the Comfort Bath cloths when I took care of my husband after his illness. The store that supplied them began to stock a thinner type of wipe which was unsatisfactory. I’m recovering from surgery and found that I could purchase the Comfort baths online. They’re wonderful for emergency cleanups and days when a shower is inconvenient. I will always keep a supply on  hand. They can even be heated in the microwave for an even more soothing experience.</li>
            <li> Great works good for bed baths</li>
            <li> I am taking care of an elderly aunt who is no longer able to get into the shower and she loves to bathe with the personal cleansing pads. It also makes it easier for the care giver.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a product similar to this before on hunting trips,&amp; really appreciated it. Some of us don&#x27;t like to go 7 days without bathing. I  have also used comfort bath, &amp; it seems to work very well. I guess that I&#x27;m not large enough to use 8 sheets as 3-4 do me quite well. you are definitely clean after using this stuff, just check out the dirty wipes after you&#x27;re done.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product highly recommend these. .</li>
            <li> My grandma can&#x27;t bath everyday, so these have been a great help. She raves at the quality and softness of the cloths. These have been a life saver for her. Anyone who has difficulty bathing on a regular basis will greatly benefit from these.</li>
            <li> A bit of warm water while trekking and it made a sponge bath.  Used several time before going into the carry out bag.  We left no trash behind.</li>
            <li> We used these for bathing whilst on the road for a camping trip. The quality of the cloths is pretty good - they are thick, durable, and aren&#x27;t too rough on the skin. The scent was not overwhelming either, which made this a great camping product. We still have quite a few left as well...they appear to have 8 cloths per pack and I believe we had 4-5 packs within the box (don&#x27;t quote me on those numbers). They were easy to store in our camping supplies as well. Just take the packages out of the box. Each package is self-sealed and resealable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Satisfied, overall. Would recommend for camping.</li>
            <li> Product identical to what was listed and arrived on schedule.  We were introduced to the cloths during hospitalization and were glad to be able to find them for home use.</li>
            <li> My husband used these when he couldn&#x27;t get in or out of the tub very well any longer. The fragrance is not overpowering, you feel clean. Wipes are a good size and the fact that you can heat them in the microwave is great! Definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> these are amazing! they are useful for removing whatever you need to remove and are gentle on the skin.the size is okay for small jobs</li>
            <li> I bought these to use during a shower renovation.  My skin feels great after I use them, much less dry and very soft.  Even though my shower is complete (and beautiful), I will continue to keep these around for when I don&#x27;t have time to take a shower.</li>
            <li> These cloths are nice and thick they do not tear as you wipe them over your skin which has been my experience with other brands of disposable washcloths.  They are also moist enough to clean your whole body with 1 cloth.  They do not have a strong scent to them which is nice they just leave me feeling refreshed since I use them after working out. I would buy them again</li>
            <li> After a bad fall and hospitalization, this helped me feel fresh when I couldn&#x27;t shower every single day. I am alright now, but keep these on hand JUST IN CASE and also a good thing to take on vacation with you!</li>
            <li> I like these because they are handy and quick to use. The package lets you take one at a time and then is resealable. You can heat the towels in a microwave oven. If I just plan to use one or two towels only I remove one towel at a time and run a little hot water on it. That saves going into the kitchen. The package seal is excellent so you don&#x27;t have to worry about revealing it.</li>
            <li> I had decided I should have sickroom supplies on hand just in case a visiting family member (or I, myself) should need such things.  I used one &amp;#34;set,&amp;#34; for partial washups, and I can see that they would work very nicely for the full bedside bath they&#x27;re designed to provide.  I like the packaging, and my order arrived speedily.</li>
            <li> If you or a family member are pretty much bed bound or unable to get into a bath or shower.  This is the way to go for effecftive cleansing.  As a registered nurse I have worked in hospitals that use this for their patients baths.  We would call it &amp;#34;bath in a bag&amp;#34;  You can heat the package up in the microwave, use what you need, and reseal it for another time.  The cloths are thick and soft.  The beauty of it is you don&#x27;t have to do any rinsing. No residue left on the skin, no oiliness, doesn&#x27;t dry out the skin.  Quick and effective.  I don&#x27;t know if they have it, but check if they have the no-rinse shampoo caps.  Those are excellent too.</li>
            <li> These are the ones that are thick, durable, and full of suds.  Just excellent.  Every other brand are just flimsy wipes masquerading as disposable washclothes.  Add a teaspoon of water and pop in the microwave for a much more comfortable bathing experience for your ill relative.</li>
            <li> While recovering from surgery, not allowed to bath until stitches removed and these were life savers.  I have very sensitive skin and had no problem using.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> I discovered these when I was recently hospitalized and couldn&#x27;t use a shower.  The are really wonderful when you can&#x27;t shower and clean very well.  Just like a nice washcloth with some soap.</li>
            <li> My second order of these.  I use them in our First Aide Kit, put some in our guest bath, our bath and in my tote..  Doesn&#x27;t have a flowery smell and you do feel fresh and clean.  Great for using on the dog too.</li>
            <li> These disposable bath washcloths are truly a God send.  They have a wonderful clean scent which is not perfumy.  They are saoft against the skin while thoroughly cleansing.  For any situation that requires being as clean as a shower while unable to shower these are the answer.  I&#x27;d use these for camping now, not just for post op or health related issues now that i have found them.  Microwaving them briefly does add that extra comfort but it is not necessary for them to be effective for a thoroughly cleaned experience.&lt;br /&gt;Sage products got them to me on time and were packaged well.</li>
            <li> with my wife&#x27;s hip replacement we found at first it was difficult to get in our bath tub/shower, so being this is what the hospital used for bathing, I purchased these.  I had bought some at the drug store but those was very thin and cheap, got these and they are a nice thickness and can be warmed in the microwave, there is a foam insolation liner in the package to keep the cloths warm while you are using the first one, Nice!</li>
            <li> Used these in the hospital great a a sponge bath, you feel really refreshed.</li>
            <li> These are great disposable wash cloths--nice and thick with plenty of bathing solution--great for older people and care givers!</li>
            <li> Found out about these pads after I had a medical procedure.  I couldn&#x27;t bathe or take a shower, so these cleaning cloths were the next best thing.  I recommend having a pack or two around just in case you can&#x27;t get into the shower.</li>
            <li> These cloths are being used for an elderly man who has mobility issues and occasional bowel incontinence.  They work well to get cleaned up when a shower or bath is not feasible.  I like the fact that they can also be heated.  I would recommend them for occasional use.  It would be nicer if they were a bit larger.  I would buy them again.</li>
            <li> these were a big disappointment and waste of money.  Half of them were completely dried-out (I guess I could&#x27;ve added water to use them, but the fragrance was horrible....). I threw them away (along with my money)</li>
            <li> I was looking for the same washcloths as the hospital. They are exactly like the ones that the hospital uses. They are great for washing up kids before school. My son uses them all the time. They work well and they are soft and last. I like that you can even warm them up before you use them too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used these for over 16 years since I am disabled &amp; sometimes not well enough to take a shower.  Also, ordered some for my mom who is a stroke survivor.  The cloths are so soft and they clean exceptionally well.  After use I put lotion on.  My skin feels soft and refreshed.  Would highly recommend this to anyone that could use some extra help with bathing.  Will continue to order from Amazon since my local store no longer carries these.</li>
            <li> These are terrific for a recuperating patient who can&#x27;t manage a tub or shower. Contents are &amp;#34;just right&amp;#34; for a largish man. Helps keep some one comfortable while they heal.</li>
            <li> Baby wipes are great for little ones, but they&#x27;re harder to use on an adult with special needs. These personal cleansing wipes are definitely a must for any caregiver. They ship fast, are good quality, and one wipe usually does the trick, as opposed to upwards of 20 baby wipes for the same cleaning. I highly recommend shopping with this seller.</li>
            <li> These wipes are very good for quick clean-ups.  Very good for traveling.  These Ultra-Thick Disposals are a good quality cloth.</li>
            <li> I bought these right after I had back surgery. You know, that time when your not supposed to twist and turn? These were so helpful to keep clean. Because they are thick and moist you didn&#x27;t have to worry about missing anything. Loaned some out to a friend who had knee surgery after she fell in the bathroom! A must have for anyone having surgery with weight limitations on a leg or back surgery. Probably some other instances that I can&#x27;t think of too.</li>
            <li> I broke my leg 14 weeks ago and am just now toe touch weight bearing. I can&#x27;t get around easily and my bathroom is too small for walkers or wheel chairs. These are fantastic and I can&#x27;t imagine not having them. They are quite expensive though. 4 packs of 8 clothes plus shipping $17.00. I would buy a lot more if they were cheaper but if you only need them for a little while I say get them!</li>
            <li> This was a good purchase.  The product worked just fine and it achieved the reasons it was purchased.  Works great.</li>
            <li> I bought these cloths for a friend who just had surgery.  She is familiar with hospital stays, unfortunately.  When I saw the reviews on this product, I just had to send them to her.  I visited her last week and she just raved about them!  She has been using them cool because it has been hot here, but she was so thankful for them.  I have made a believer out of her and plan to buy these again as she needs them.</li>
            <li> Met my expectations , substantial paper cloth, pleasant aroma</li>
            <li> These cloths can be used right out of the package or heated in the microwave. I used them after having ankle surgery. I was unable to walk and needed a way to freshen up in between sponge baths. This product is also good for someone who is in a hospital or nursing home. I would recommend.</li>
            <li> My husband has COPD &amp; emphysema, he has had 2 collapsed lungs this year and was in the hospital for a month and a half. During his hospital stay the nurses used these wipes to give him a bath. It is hard for him to shower due to the moisture in the air making it hard to breathe. There is also the worry that if he gets short of breath he could pass out in the shower so I have to be there if he wants a real shower for safety. These wipes are the same wipes the nurses used in the hospital and really make it easy for him to see to his hygiene while I&#x27;m at work. The price was very reasonable.</li>
            <li> Got these for my wife following her surgery and long recovery. They made such a difference as she wasn&#x27;t ab;e to take her usual bath for weeks! She gave the five stars!!!</li>
            <li> I love Comfort Bath.  I&#x27;ve used it when I&#x27;ve had surgery and bathing would be difficult for a few days.  I&#x27;ve recommended it to friends in the same situation and they have also loved it.  And you really feel clean after using it to take a \\&quot;bath.\\&quot;  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> My mother-in-law started using them in the hospital and loved them, especially warmed.</li>
            <li> I have been purchasing this product for years and will continue to use it.  Cleans very well and smells clean.</li>
            <li> excellent for cleaning bodies</li>
            <li> Ordered too many but with all the athletes in my family I am sure they will get used.  I ordered them for my up coming surgery, a weekend trip to an island off the coast of NH where showering is limited.  I&#x27;m sure they will get used and come in real handy.</li>
            <li> Perfect cleaning cloths if you are a caregiver for an elderly person.  With MRSA infections so prevalent, these disposable cloths are a reality.  You warm them in the microwave first which is very comforting for an elderly person who gets cold easily.  Good cloths, good product and great value priced.  Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> These were just OK in my opinion.  They left a film or residue on the skin that was kind of tacky.  My husband did not care for them as much</li>
            <li> Comfort Bath is a great product&lt;br /&gt;Very refreshing . Cleans well.&lt;br /&gt;Does not leave your skin dry</li>
            <li> Gift for my sister who has broken her leg in several places and is not mobile. She loves them. She really likes the fact that they can be heated in the microwave.</li>
            <li> I learned about these when my husband was in the hospital, and have continued using them since he came home. The cloths make a bed bath much easier.</li>
            <li> These worked great when my son was in a hip cast/brace for six weeks and was not allowed to bathe. They can be used as is or heated up.</li>
            <li> This product can be warmed in the microwave and stays warm for awhile in the package. The cloths are thick and hold up well. They are hypoallergenic, so they don&#x27;t bother me. I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> These are perfect.  No odor - so my husband uses them when he goes hunting for a quick cleanup.  I keep them stashed in the car for quick clean-ups and we have a box in our emergency packs as well.</li>
            <li> These are very nice to have when you have a sick person at home.  The cloths are substantial, work well and do a good job.  I like the fact that they can be used at room temperature or can be warmed in the microwave for a hot bath.</li>
            <li> Totally made the days post surgery where showering and baths weren&#x27;t an option far easier to tolerate when I could get someone to help me use these cloths to cleanse myself.  I&#x27;ll certainly buy then again if/when the need arises and recommend them to anyone who&#x27;s prepping for post-op care.  My sensitive skin was not irritated by them either which is a huge plus.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping,  great product I&#x27;ve ordered several times.</li>
            <li> The product is a easy quick way to clean up a bedridden person up when needed, not as good a bath/shower but when that&#x27;s not a option these will do.</li>
            <li> Love this product and its quality. Easy to use and leaves the skin soft and smooth,wonderful for sensitive skin.My husband smells great!</li>
            <li> Comfort Bath personal cleansing is very convenient for a frail person like me with the relative ease of scrubbing with the cloths.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly; nice feel and good for personal cleansing</li>
            <li> This product is excellent</li>
            <li> These wipes are a nice size, sufficiently moist, and thick, what I thought I&#x27;d like.  Although I like the thickness, they leave me sticky until the residue finally dries on the skin.  Then they&#x27;re almost okay, except that I don&#x27;t feel clean.  I bought them to replace Sam&#x27;s Club, Simply Right brand, which arrived more dry than wet and weren&#x27;t as thick.  The Simply Right are 12\\&quot;X8\\&quot;, so they&#x27;re slightly larger than these Comfort 8\\&quot;X8\\&quot;.  Neither brand will exfoliate old skin and residue and they&#x27;re no substitute for a good shower, but good to have for simple/small clean-ups.  Despite the fact that the Sam&#x27;s Club brand is dry and not as thick as Comfort Bath, I prefer the Sam&#x27;s Club.  I simply rinse them for added moisture and to eliminate some of the chemicals, especially the fragrance and carcinogens, which both brands have.</li>
            <li> Just like the hospital uses.  Great for touch ups between showers or bathes.  Antibacterial, moisturizing, pH neutral, deodorizing.  No drying necessary.  Good for the skin</li>
            <li> Perfect for post surgery hygiene when you can&#x27;t shower right away</li>
            <li> After surgery: a must have.&lt;br /&gt;On a hot day, getting sweat off after doing a bit of housework, or for washing off dusty feet or even mud on arms, perfect. It&#x27;s not a shower, but sometimes this is the quickest and quite good enough.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve never heated them, but I may be this winter as am having another surgery and it will be a cold recovery in the winter in CA. Usually I&#x27;m in a much hotter year-round climate where I always have a package going.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I buy them in bulk, so that rates 5 stars.</li>
            <li> My husband likes them, so I buy! Could be a little moister but nice and thick and can be heated in microwave before use.</li>
            <li> These very substantial but disposable washcloths were just what we needed when my sister was recovering from hip replacement surgery. Great product!</li>
            <li> I am in FUBAR condition. Between a wheelchair 99% of the time and not at all able to shower other than 1% of the time. I take the equivilant of an acceptable shower or spunge bath if you will, twice a day. At night before sleep and in the morning when I wake. I was a clean freak all my life. This GETS THE JOB DONE and way to my satisfaction. I both (pardon me) because I&#x27;m old old old now, poop and pee on myself from time to time. NO problem ever. This is a quality X10 product, NOT NO cheapo baby wipes which leave a whole lot to be desired. Baby wipes are $2 a pack, and you get $2 of worth of service. Try these one time, and I&#x27;ll give you your money back. I have no one to assist me, I&#x27;m on my own. But I am one clean person. This is like a wash cloth and NOT a thin baby wipe.</li>
            <li> ....so that says it all!  Actually started using them on RV trips so we don&#x27;t have to clean out the stuff we store in the shower every day when we are on the road.  I have pretty sensitive skin and some irritation issues, so I was a bit skeptical.  But I liked them so much that now I use them sometimes after exercise or if I&#x27;m feeling really lazy and don&#x27;t want to shower one day :)!  They work perfectly to eliminate odor and prevent irritation; I basically feel like I have showered after I use them.  I only use one thick cloth over my entire body; I don&#x27;t use separate cloths for every body part - that is unnecessary and wasteful in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I like  it a lot great job.</li>
            <li> Good product. Exactly as advertised. Well packed and promptly shipped. A+</li>
            <li> I keep these on hand for emergency situations. They are great to give a grandchild a quick wipe!!</li>
            <li> We use these when camping or travelling in one of our campers when we are not near a shower.  These are not baby wipes, but pre loaded wash cloths.  I first saw these for use in the hospital.  They are expensive, but after a long hike or fishing trip where there are no shower facilities, I feel clean when I get into the sleeping bag.</li>
            <li> These are great size for adults and a good price.</li>
            <li> LOVE this item...my mom...</li>
            <li> Wonderful!  I had foot surgery with a up to the knee dressing which I could not get wet...period  I could not set foot in a shower for at least 3 weeks.  I was turned on to this cleaning product while I was in the VA Hospital in Cheyenne.  They gave me enough to tide me over until my order came from Amazon. What a great product I was able to keep clean, and sweet smelling for all of those weeks, even though I am once again able to shower I am going to keep a supply of these around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These would be great for a parent on the road with small children, motion sickness, &amp;quot;accidents&amp;quot;, ice cream stickies, all of these things could be quickly dealt with, these are much, much better then a baby wipe, and you have the option of full head to toe clean up without water so you have a clean body to put in clean cloths.  There are are eight thick washcloths in each packet intended to do one adult it would not take that many to do a head to toe clean up on a child so you could keep the  unused portion sealed up in a zip-lock bag. This outfit also makes a waterless hair cleaning system, also available here a at Amazon I have a couple here that I have not used the cleaning system is all incorporated into a show cap.  I am mostly bald so the bath system does the job, but for the little girl in a, brother dumped an ice cream cone on the head disaster it might just do the trick.  If I was traveling with small children I would definitely have a supply of these on hand.</li>
            <li> This is a great product!  I will be reordering!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 62 and have severe osteoarthritis and diabetic neuropathy. These are a Godsend on days when I am too stiff or in too much pain to move. I regularly use them to freshen up during the day. Microwaving provides soothing and comforting warmth to sore feet and painful joints.</li>
            <li> These are great - my husband is disabled from a stroke &amp; has had many medical issues since.  I just keep a few boxes of these wipes handy at all times - they&#x27;re think, make him feel nice &amp; clean.  SOOOOOOO much easier that dragging out soap, water, washcloth, towel... etc.</li>
            <li> I just got my hip replaced and so I&#x27;ve got limited mobility for a while. It&#x27;s difficult for me to take a full shower, so I use these to take a sponge bath on the days in between.  These are the same clothes that they used on me in the hospital.  I put them in the microwave for 30 sec and I have a nice soapy wash cloth. I use one for my face, one for my upper body and one for the lower half. They do leave a bit of sticky residue in places like my armpit and elbow joint, so I rinse with a regular wet wash cloth. I&#x27;m recommending these to other friends getting surgery. Plus, I&#x27;m thinking these will be great to take camping as they are better than baby wipes.</li>
            <li> These are SUPER thick and really work well to allow you to SCRUB yourself hard and get out that dug in dust. ;) trust.</li>
            <li> Thank you. Every now and then, it acts temporarily to replace the shower</li>
            <li> I have tested this brand and the No Rinse brand of body cleansing pads for the last 3 months due to an inability to take showers due to major reconstructive foot surgery. I liked this slightly better for general all over bathing because they seemed to be slightly more moist but preferred the other brand for the private parts because they left less moisture in that area.  Both are great products and saved the day for me during this very difficult time. These felt so great when warmed, especially when my husband got the privilege of washing my back</li>
            <li> These Comfort Bath Disposable Washclothes are great!  They are great to take along in the RV in case you are short on water or lack of.  Most importantly, after surgeries when you are limited to showers/bathes they are the perfect way to take care of your hygiene.  Heat up in the microwave and toss away - no rinse necessary.  Everyone should have them on hand!!</li>
            <li> Wipes are thick and soft. Perfect for cleansing. Wish there were more in each pack but live this.</li>
            <li> Item as advertised.  Prompt shipping.</li>
            <li> I recently had surgery and couldn&#x27;t shower for three weeks.  This product smells good, is nice and leaves no film.  I felt fresh and clean.  I would buy again.  Superior product.</li>
            <li> They could smell better.  Does the job though.</li>
            <li> My only complaint about this product is that it cools off very quickly.  Gets very hot so you have to wait a minute so as not to burn the skin.  Cleans well and treats the skin but you have to be quick.</li>
            <li> Ok for a refresher. Has no antibacterial in it so if bed bound your not cleaning germs. Thickness is great and can microwave. Price a little high</li>
            <li> We &amp;#34;dry camp&amp;#34; / boondock a lot with our Airstream.  We use these to help conserve water in these &amp;#34;non-hookup&amp;#34; situations. They are a great way to clean up in the moring before starting your day and without using a lot of water taking a shower.</li>
            <li> These do an excellent job of personal hygene care for my invalid relative. Never any sores or rashes</li>
            <li> the perfect solution for bathing when you cannot get into a shower or bathtub for whatever reason.  great for the elderly, someone confined to bed or after surgery.&lt;br /&gt;doesn&#x27;t dry out the skin, has a pleasant smell and it&#x27;s nice and warm out of the microwave.</li>
            <li> Probably the best cleansing cloths I have ever used.  Delivery was super quick.</li>
            <li> I used these washcloths after spine surgery four years ago as I was in a body cast and unable to shower for three months. I had shoulder surgery this week and will need to sponge bathe for six weeks.  These are awesome for people who are recovering from surgery, or can not shower/bathe for other reasons.  This is my first purchase from Amazon; I previously purchased them at a local drugstore.  They have a long shelf life, too.  Tonight I opened up a package that was four years old and they are still very moist and comforting.  Great, clean fragrance that is not over-powering.</li>
            <li> These wipes are thick so they don;t fall apart in use and are large enough to clean all the body.  They are handy for use while traveling and for those who cannot bathe or shower due to illness or disability.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> Our sons use these to wipe down after every wrestling match when they go to tournaments. We read a small study in which high school wrestlers did this, and the group that used these had significantly fewer skin infections. One of our sons has eczema, and these wipes don&#x27;t appear to irritate his skin at all. They&#x27;re also quite thick, so they&#x27;re pretty easy to use. We also use these when we go camping, and they work very well for that.</li>
            <li> These cloths are thick and warm in the microwave for patient comfort.</li>
            <li> These are just like the ones the hospital uses and when you microwave them like package describes they are wonderful!</li>
            <li> Great product! I use it for when I oversleep and have to skip the shower and I throw a pack in my luggage when I travel, just in case. Always delivered promptly.</li>
            <li> Great item.I Will definitely buy again. In a time of rush &amp; a quick cleanup tjis is what you need  .</li>
            <li> I bought these for my husband, who had used a similar item while in the hospital. He liked them, so I searched, and found, these on Amazon. He is totally satisfied with the product, and I am pleased with the timeliness of the delivery!</li>
            <li> Theses packages are great for personal hygiene, these packages can be placed in a microwave so that the moist towels are warm and refreshing. Each towelette will give you plenty of usage compared to other brands that are Mae cheap. The fragrance is a nice fresh scent hat the patient will enjoy. I highly recommend these!</li>
            <li> Have used this product for a long time and it works well.  It has very good cleansing properties and smells very good.</li>
            <li> These are great for quick baths or if need to help someone bathe.  No mess and work well</li>
            <li> My grandson requested baby wipes to be sent for his deployment to Afghanistan, and was looking for something a little bigger for him.  So I have sent these to him and hope they work well for him.</li>
            <li> I have been buying this comfort bath product for some time now and am very happy with it.  Would recommend to anyone who is a caregiver for a loved one.</li>
            <li> I REALLY ENJOY THE FRESHNEESS OF THE COMFORT BATH PERSONAL CLEANSING CLOTHS.THEY ARE THICK AND FEEL GREAT AFTER,THEY ARE WARMED IN MICROWAVE.GREAT WHEN YOU WANT A LIGHT WASH RATHER THAN A BATH.AND THEY ARE MUCH QUICKER.SHIPPING TIME WAS GREAT. PRODUCT WAS EXACTLY AS DESCRIBED.WOULD PURCHASE AGAIN.</li>
            <li> Love this product! Perfect for my 90 year old Mom during the cold winter months!!</li>
            <li> These large thick disposable washcloths are so useful to have on hand.  They can be rinsed out and used over and over.  I don&#x27;t like to remove makeup with my good terrycloth washcloths, it stains them.  These can be used several times for that and then clean up the whole bathroom sink area and whatever else needs it.  They came promptly and are just like the ones used in the hospital where I first saw them.  Great produict. Great service from the dealer.</li>
            <li> thx for this its great but i dont know what else to say too many words. ok ok ok ok..</li>
            <li> They are just perfect for my Grandfather.&lt;br /&gt;I will be ordering more.</li>
            <li> Good to have on hand. These are super soft, and can be used multiple times</li>
            <li> The best personal bath wipes. Use these for giving a bedridden or immobile family member a bath. Could be used to wash up when traveling. These aren&#x27;t the little wipes like you buy at the grocery. It&#x27;s more like a premoistened washcloth. Highly recommend. You can even microwave them to make it more comfortable to use.</li>
            <li> good product, they cleanse gently.  I use them even without heating in microwave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;quick shipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;used these in the hospital, bought&lt;br /&gt;these to wash down while recovering&lt;br /&gt;because it is dangerous for me to enter and exit the tub.</li>
            <li> I ordered these due to having foot surgery and not being able to get the dressings wet. I love my showers usually twice a day so I was pleasantly surprised that these do the job. No you don&#x27;t get a long relaxing bath but they get the job done. Pop them in the microwave and wipe down to get truly clean without stripping your skin. Don&#x27;t get me wrong (2 weeks in and still 2 weeks to go) I miss my showers and baths.</li>
            <li> I had a buddy who used to be in the Army and he told.me they used these things down range when they can be out there a week or so and workin pretty hard. He said they really did the job. Now if youre driving long hauls and you dont want to go days without a shower or bath here is your solution. You probably wont be able to heat them in a microwave unless you have a 12 volt microwave in your cab but youll be clean and a lot happier and healthier than if you dont use them.</li>
            <li> These are amazing and do a better than expected job of cleaning you without the need for rinsing. Just warm them and you have a bath in a pouch. The cloths do a great job of removing dirt and oils leaving you fresh and clean feeling. They smell nice too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m recovering from back surgery, so showers are difficult.  this product keeps me clean with very little hassle.  the only thing I strongly recommend is that you warm the little cloths before you use them, otherwise it&#x27;s like running an ice cube over your body.  I can see where these will be handy for lot of other things, once my incision has healed and I&#x27;m back on my feet.  Well worth it.</li>
            <li> After a total joint replacement, I had difficulty showering everyday.  These are nice and thick.  One cloth will go a long way.  I only needed two head to toe.  The price is very reasonable for the value.</li>
            <li> My husband hunts and these are great if you do not have a shower in the woods. He used these and really liked them.</li>
            <li> these are great for anyone recuperating from surgery or traveling or camping.</li>
            <li> I tried many disposable cleaning cloths in the past.  This product was effective, and the scent not is antiseptic.  After using them, I felt that they did a much better job.</li>
            <li> item was as described</li>
            <li> I recently had knee surgery and was unable to shower for a couple of weeks.  Not a good situation.  So, I planned ahead and bought these cleansing pads.  They really are quite thick and filled with a soothing cleanser.  Plenty of towelettes in each pack to adequately lather up the entire body.  After a good scrub, the cleanser dries without any residue or &amp;#34;stickiness&amp;#34;.  You really will feel clean.  Next best thing to a shower!</li>
            <li> Much thicker than most.  Can be used for an entire bed bath.</li>
            <li> Best bath cloths ever! I was in the hospital for 6 weeks and the nurses used these on me. After I got out I tried a few other types, but came back to these. Large size is great, pleasant smelling, leaves no residue. Wonderful product!</li>
            <li> Use this product everyday with my mother who is 84 years. No mess, I bath her once or twice a day  with them and she&#x27;s clean.</li>
            <li> Though I haven&#x27;t used yet (having knee surgery Monday) I have in the past. They came in time and the package was all good. Thanks!!!</li>
            <li> This product was a great disappointment. I have used other products that are much better. My biggest disappointment is the size.</li>
            <li> My elderly mom uses these all the time.  You can&#x27;t buy them in the store anymore.  They are great to freshen up also - very thick and leaves you feeling fresh and clean.  Great for someone who has had surgery and can&#x27;t get in the tub or shower.</li>
            <li> These bath wipes are amazing. I cannot get into a bathtub and we are remodeling our shower, so I can&#x27;t bathe for two weeks. We are one week into the remodeling, and I feel and smell clean. Would I rather be able to take a shower? Of course, I would. But for the next week, that&#x27;s not in the cards. I am so glad I found these bath wipes. They are thick and super wet, plus they smell good. I would highly recommend them to anyone for any reason.</li>
            <li> My husband has mobility issues and cannot get into a bath or shower.  I bathe him using these cloths and he loves them.  They leave his skin clean and moisturized - and it makes everything easier for me as well!</li>
            <li> These are ok...seem a little sticky on the skin. I prefer the &amp;#34;no rinse&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;Brand much better. They are smaller than no rinse and don&#x27;t smell&lt;br /&gt;as good either.</li>
            <li> We did some field exercises in the army over 21 days and I was only able to take 3 showers.  I was recommended these by another soldier and they came in handy.  It&#x27;s nice to wash off the dirt and scrub the important bits with a couple of these.  I felt refeshed and clean.  I&#x27;ve used them a few times since for traveling and camping and fieldwork.  They are meant to be a waterless bath for people who are wheelchair or bed bound but they worked great for my uses.&lt;br /&gt;If you would like to know something specific about this item just ask and I&#x27;ll try to respond within a day or so.</li>
            <li> You feel just as if you had a real bath.  Since I have recovered from surgery, I use now and then when something comes up and I have to clean up in a hurry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A must have for the sick patient - the time when a bath or shower is either impossible or too tiring.</li>
            <li> For several years, I purchased &amp;quot;Comfort Shields&amp;quot; wipes by this same manufacturer, at Drugstore.com. When they suddenly doubled in price, Drugstore stopped carrying them! I frantically looked around for another source, and paid the price here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then, I thought I&#x27;d try these bath wipes, not expecting as much as the Shields.  BUT, they are terrific!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, Shields still have their place, when I need a bit more skin lubrication, but Comfort Bath towels are great for everyday use!  Love &#x27;em, Amazon, and I hope that YOU don&#x27;t drop them...</li>
            <li> I use it personally.  Don&#x27;t care for the fragrance, but if it cleans, I won&#x27;t argue.  Tough to bathe everynight, so every other night I just do a quick wipe down.  Just microwave for short time to warm up towelettes.  They are pretty thick and easy to use.  Just need to pick up the no rinse shampoo now.</li>
            <li> Washing with these is so easy and enjoyable.  Smell is nice, too.  They are thick and wet--and don&#x27;t really need to be followed with a rinse.</li>
            <li> Product arrived as promised . I saw these wipes at the hospital when my husband was hospitalized. and find them really much better than the baby wipes I was using. The resealable packaging keeps unused wipes from drying out .</li>
            <li> They were comparable but not the brand I selected or thought I was getting</li>
            <li> My husband had his knee replaced, and was given these in the hospital to wash up with. They can be heated in the microwave, and my husband reports that they are very thick and large (unlike Baby Wipes). We were pleased to find them here at Amazon as he will not be able to shower for the next couple of weeks. The price was very good and they were delivered to us very quickly. We intend to keep them on hand for camping and extended Jeep trips.</li>
            <li> Rite aid no longers carries this style of personal thick disposable wash clothes.  In doing a search on Amazon we located this brand.  It will be a good replacement for the ones no longer carried at rite aid.</li>
            <li> My elderly mother prefers these and she can do it herself</li>
            <li> Excellent service &amp; great product!</li>
            <li> These are value priced and a quality product.  If you are looking for a deal - here it is!  I highly recommended them.</li>
            <li> These are terrific, good for my sensitive skin, &amp; they really clean. But they cost far too much. Make them affordable again, &amp; you&#x27;ve got a regular customer!</li>
            <li> Large, Strong, soft, very moist wipes.  not only very convenient , but soft on the skin and order free.  Warm in the microwave or use cold if you are tough enough.  1/23/14 update:  While I did not see a mention of SCENT in product description....  according to my wife these smell like lemon bathroom cleaner.  One in the hospital had no scent.  So she only uses these if she can rinse...which is a bit defeating.</li>
            <li> These cloths were very plush and thick. I used them for my husband after his hip replacement surgery before he could have a shower. It was a nice feature that you could warm them up really helped my husband feel refreshed and clean.&lt;br /&gt;Often when we dry camp in our motorhome we have used diaper wipes for washing up between showers. These are like a thick cotton wash cloths that are very large. They have a nice scent. I am sure these will be put to good use on future camping trips.</li>
            <li> Arrived boxed in a different box, but appear sealed and work well for those touch ups.</li>
            <li> I have a very rare genetic disorder that has worsened, leaving me homebound and very weak. I was given these personal cleansing cloths during a recent hospitalization, since I was too ill to shower.&lt;br /&gt;I wasn&#x27;t confident about the product because I have very sensitive skin. But I tried them out of necessity, and I was very surprised and pleased!&lt;br /&gt;First, each cloth is substantial, it&#x27;s not like using a damp paper towel. It feels like a woven cloth.&lt;br /&gt;Secondly, each cloth is just moist enough - neither too dry, nor too wet.&lt;br /&gt;Thirdly, the cleansing fluid in the product has a very light, clean fragrance - not sweet or flowery, and I was grateful for that. I didn&#x27;t want to continue to feel nauseated because of my illness, and have to smell like cheap perfume as well. I didn&#x27;t, I felt and smelled clean.&lt;br /&gt;The cleansing cloths not only freshened me up, I was able to get REALLY clean all over.&lt;br /&gt;This is so important for someone like me who is too sick now to shower or take a bath, but needs the dignity of not having to be bathed by someone else.&lt;br /&gt;As soon as I got home from the hospital I went online and happily ordered more of these &amp;#34;Comfort Bath Cloths&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll continue to use them until I can get better, hopefully, and be able to resume my normal shower routine.&lt;br /&gt;I will keep a box with me though, for when I visit relatives that only have one bathroom and lots of family staying there - no more waiting hours to shower!</li>
            <li> When you have a need for these you really need them.  I did after my operation.</li>
            <li> I use these after my husbands comes home from the hospital-I can always depend on them not taking good care of him-especially his bottom always gets a yeast infection-so I need disposable soft wash cloths and these are at the top of my list.</li>
            <li> My husband had surgery.  These cloths- which the hospital staff will warm for you in the microwave- worked a lot better than the washcloth/water in a sink to make him feel clean without compromising the area of surgery. They ones that were still in the package stayed warm until they were used.  I think he felt a lot better in the hospital when he could clean up.  In our opinions, they were the next best thing to a shower until he could take one.</li>
            <li> Now I had my doubts about this product..boy was I wrong! lol..I am handicapped or disabled and i never thought I could find something like this that would really work..WOW...Nice and thick washcloths that really do clean very well and leave my skin nice and soft...Worth every penny and then some..Not only does it clean very well but imagine how much money u will save on ur water bill!! As we all know you and every one else is trying to save money these days while and where they can..It is of my opinion that you can&#x27;t go wrong with this product..I am buying some more right now!!Good luck to everyone :)</li>
            <li> I had to go to the doctor and my bath nurse never came.  These \\&quot;Comfort Bath Cloths\\&quot; really came to my rescue.  They are an inch or two larger than a regular sized wash cloth.  They are the thickness of felt.  This feels really soft against the body.  The fragrance is fresh, clean and light.  Once you are finished washing the fragrance fades, and you can perfume yourself with the smells you love.  There is not even a whiff of bad orders left after you wash.  \\&quot;Comfort Bath Cloths\\&quot; were a delightful surprise that really does what they claim to do.  You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> nice think wipes great for camping where showers not best option very nice quality!</li>
            <li> I met this product in hospital following surgery. Use routinely at home every other day.&lt;br /&gt;Saves water in drought stricken California.</li>
            <li> Purchased for a camping trip.  I put one of the packages of wipes in the sleeping bag with me to warm it up for morning use.  The cloths are moist, thick and soft; they worked well on cleaning me up and leaving me refreshed.  The only complaint is the cleaning agent leaves a slight &amp;#34;film&amp;#34; on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;I understand why it&#x27;s better to not use alcohol or some other drying agent in the liquid cleaner but ......&lt;br /&gt;I will however, continue to use these because they work and I do not regret buying them.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and best part is the cloths can be warmed.&lt;br /&gt;much better for an invalid then messy water and wash ccloths.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, this is the third order and will be ordering more in the near  future.  The disposable washcloths are a  must  to have at home.</li>
            <li> I have been keeping these on hand for years...and will NEVER be without them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having recently gone through a total knee replacement, I stocked up on these to get through the first couple of weeks while my mobility was questionable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used other brands (teeny and thin) and the liquid no-rinse soaps, but am sold on Comfort Bath.  THe size is easy to use, the cloths are thick and don&#x27;t shred, they warm up in the microwave, and they are small enough to carry along in a purse/tote.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve opened a pack that was sitting around for a couple of years, and they were perfect. I expected to have to dampen them a bit, but there was no mosture loss.  I&#x27;ve never had an issue with them drying out, and IF they ever did, I&#x27;m sure a quick spritz with warm water would freshen them up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They may be more expensive than some of the other brands, but for my money, these are the best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve never seen them stocked in stores, so using Amazon is the BEST way to get them (and everything else, for that matter)</li>
            <li> One packet of wipes is for ONE bath! It only has 4 baths per box. Even if you only use half per bath it is a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Great product, fast delivery. This product is perfect for my son to use after PE since his high school does not have showers.</li>
            <li> I was unable to shower for several weeks after surgery.  These things were up for the challenge.  Great way to stay clean.</li>
            <li> best washcloths i have found.  what good is a thin cloth when trying to bathe an elderly person?  these are thick and large and really get the job done!  don&#x27;t have to rinse, and leave the skin feeling clean and moisturized.</li>
            <li> I am. Bare foot gal. These are great hurry up cleaner. I use them when I come in from the garden.&lt;br /&gt;My mom is over ninety, I use them for her when she is to tired to shower.</li>
            <li> These are great for my elderly mom to use on a daily basis between showers.</li>
            <li> Found while in Hospital. Glad to have at Home. Stay clean even when Bandages prevent wet bathing. Dispose of in Trash NOT Toilet!</li>
            <li> nice and thick  will purchase agein</li>
            <li> I just recently had foot surgery and cannot get in my tub. My bathroom is so small I can&#x27;t safely give myself a sponge bath there so I ordered these. No fuss, no mess, just heat in microwave and use to give myself a sponge bath. I had used this at the hospital but got these instead of the ones I used at the hospital because they were cheaper. They are so similar to what I used at the hospital that it would have been crazy to pay more.</li>
            <li> They clean well but kind of leave a sticky feeling on the skin even after dried. May work better if you use a sprinkling of powder after.</li>
            <li> These towelettes are strong and useful. They would be good for traveling although now I am using them as I have an arm in a sling and the right side of my body cannot be washed. I wish they were a little thinner but a little bigger and packed in individual wrappers, but they will do nicely.</li>
            <li> I purchased for my elderly mom. Just as good as Ready Bath which are way over priced. If the price remains low, I will purchase again.</li>
            <li> I bought these for a friend who had surgery and couldn&#x27;t bathe. I also bought some for myself as I wanted to try them for quick clean ups when I don&#x27;t have time for a shower. I do shower daily but wanted to try these after taking a walk, or cleaning the house and then need to make a trip to the store. The towels are thick and soft, the scent is kind of odd though, not really fresh or clean smelling. They work okay but are not the best ones on the market.</li>
            <li> We have a clawfoot tub in the home we rent &amp; I&#x27;ve had increasing trouble getting into it as my rheumatoid arthritis has gotten progressively more disabling.  These adult washcloths really do the trick - I feel completely clean after using them &amp; buying them in this value size made them fairly cost-efficient.  I swear by these!</li>
            <li> Though the product page indicates they are for people who have difficulty bathing due to illness or injury, they can be used by anybody any time you need to freshen up but taking a bath or shower just isn&#x27;t possible. They would be handy for teachers or office workers who like to take a walk during their lunch break. They&#x27;re also handy for cleaning up mud splashed legs after walking through a puddle, wiping off sand after a trip to the beach, or any other times when part of your body needs a clean up. They are thicker than the hand wipes or baby wipes that come in pop up canisters. They clean off the skin without leaving a sticky or soapy type residue. They can be used at room temperature or warmed in the microwave. They could also probably be kept in the refrigerator to help cool off on a hot day.</li>
            <li> I put these in my gym bag and use them after working out.  They don&#x27;t feel soapy and I don&#x27;t feel the need to rinse off after using them. I would highly recommend them for gym and travel.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product, guided by customer reviews and company promises, on August 18,2012. I received, September 6, a box of dried out, coarse paper towels. I can only surmise that, as other customers have experienced, these are outdated items.  If this is not the case then the bath towels and their packaging are simply inferior. I regret the time wasted. I could have ordered a similar product from a more reliable company and had them three weeks ago and the product I actually received would have been of some use to me. Having automatically discarded the shipping materials when they arrived I can&#x27;t return them and am left with towelettes I might be able to wet and use for the dog if adding water will actually soften them. She won&#x27;t tolerate coarse materials on her sensitive areas either.  Otherwise, and what, in the current state of disgust, is most probable, I will just throw them away to keep from being constantly reminded of how I allowed myself to trust, spend, wait, only to have to subject myself to the same process all over again with another supplier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most of  us who purchase these towelettes first experienced their use in hospital. I don&#x27;t need them to replace a bath but use them between daily baths to  keep sensitive areas as clean as is possible to keep human skin with its own natural flora and constant exposure to possible pathogens. These are not frivolous purchases or items for the lazy or slothful, these are medical supplies produced by companies whose business is the production of medical devices and supplies. I don&#x27;t think it unreasonable to expect these people to be trustworthy, ethical. But-  my experience with them does not speak well for them, their practice is as far from ethical as it is possible to devolve.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product for my travels in the remote villages of rural Ethiopia.  They kept me clean and fresh for several days where and when access to clean running water was unavailable.  A must have for these conditions.</li>
            <li> I \\&quot;discovered\\&quot; these bath cloths during a recent hospitalization and was pleased to find them on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They can&#x27;t be beat for quick clean ups while travelling or camping.  So much better than normal wet wipes.</li>
            <li> Great for elder care for in between baths.  Also great to have in the car for &amp;#34;accidents&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I have used these for years.  I first discovered them while caring for my Mother and bathing was extremely difficult.  These are as they say &amp;#34;Complete&amp;#34; care.  My Mother&#x27;s skin was clean, soft and smelled like she had freshly bathed. I keep a supply on hand at all times to be used for a quick clean and just incase the water supply is stops.  Always prepared with a GREAT produce that does as they say.  I would recommend these to anyone with a health issue or a water issue OR just to have on hand.  Thank You for a product that made my Mother&#x27;s last year dignified.</li>
            <li> These great product, an essential item for those time a shower isn&#x27;t possible. They are nice and thick, and can heat in the microwave.</li>
            <li> This was a gift to a home-bound friend.  She has already used the product and loves it.</li>
            <li> These waterless bath cloths are great.  They are similar to baby wipes, but the cloth is much larger and thicker.  They smell good and you feel clean after using them.</li>
            <li> I use these for my mother--they are nice and thick.  We love that they can be heated in the microwave!!</li>
            <li> I purchased this Comfort Bath Personal Cleaning Ultra thick wash cloths  for a dear friend whose husband has Dementia and has to be taken care of,cleaned up many times a day. He is under Hospice care ,in a hospital bed .She is trying to take care of him at home instead of putting him in nursing home. She says these are wonderful and appreciated me getting them for her to use to keep her husband clean. Thanks to who ever made this product it is great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got MS and it is exhausting and difficult to get in the shower.  I shower once or twice a week and use disposable towels for cleansing in between.  I&#x27;ve tried them all and have even made my own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These towels make me feel like I have taken a shower.  The cloths are substantial and moist.  All I can say is they make me feel clean.  What a Godsend!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are on the fence... TRY THESE!!!</li>
            <li> I was given these one time when I was in the hospital, remembered them and now i keep them on-hand for home use.  They really do clean you up,  have a pleasant smell, are soft and comfortable easy to use, and are great for when someone can&#x27;t get in the bath or shower due to injury or illness.  I found ideal for camping and although you couldn&#x27;t microwave them, I found you can warm them up with warm water either in a closed package or individually.</li>
            <li> Got them for my mom (96).  She&#x27;s happy to have them.</li>
            <li> my daughter who gets her feet really dirty playing outside can use these quickly and easily instead of taking a shower.</li>
            <li> My husband and I are over-the-road truck drivers.  We use these on the road between showers.  Refreshing without leaving a sticky feeling.</li>
            <li> This were so strong and thick. You got a lot of use from just one. I&#x27;ll keep this on hand.</li>
            <li> I have tried a number of different rinseless wipes in the past, but none have ever been either as moist or as thick as the Comfort Bath wipes.  Due to disabilities I can only use the shower when thoroughly rested, so have to depend on wipes between times.  These not only get me clean, they don&#x27;t leave the often sticky (soap-like) residue that so many rinseless wipes do.  No, you don&#x27;t feel as clean as you do with a shower, but you will feel cleaner than with any other rinseless wipe (can&#x27;t remember all the brands I have tried as I&#x27;ve been using the Comfort Bath wipes for a number of years).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the only time I have found wipes dry in the package is when I have an open package that wasn&#x27;t correctly resealed and had been sitting over a long period of time (2 weeks or more).  I also use these when cleaning my skin after removing medicinal patches.  With my extra sensitive skin it is absolutely necessary to get all residue from both medicine and adhesive off, and these do without having to scrub.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You definitely shouldn&#x27;t go wrong with the Comfort Bath wipes.  Was very glad to see that they are now sold on Amazon, much cheaper than elsewhere.</li>
            <li> Wipes are of high quality and I would recommend them.  Scent is pleasant and product is good to use when needed.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I was looking for and my medical supply company no longer carries these. They are thick and soft and durable. You can even clean them and use them several times if you want because of the quality.</li>
            <li> I love these and will continue to order more!</li>
            <li> Very good price and a great product shipped on time and I was very satisfied with the complete process&lt;br /&gt;Of this order</li>
            <li> Love these for bed baths or just a quick cleanup.  Patients love them too as you warm them up for them.</li>
            <li> These large, thick and moist wipes leave you feeling clean and refreshed. The resealable package makes it great for people on the go. I&#x27;ll keep one in my gym bag for those days when I don&#x27;t have time to take a full-on shower, and one in the car making cleanups a breeze. I will definitely be repurchasing!</li>
            <li> Great value....I&#x27;m a wildland firefighter and spend 12 to 14 hours out on the line before we get back to camp after dinner and debrief there isn&#x27;t always time to get a shower so a quick wipe down and I&#x27;m clean and feel ready to get some shut eye.  These work great.  One wipe down and I feel 1000% better.  No fuzz left over on my face stubble.  Thick and they don&#x27;t fall apart.  Plenty of liquid on the sheet.  The re-seal works great.</li>
            <li> Bought these after seeing them used in a hospital.  They are great washing up when a shower is not an option.  Whether it&#x27;s a health issue or just a camping trip, these are great.  They are large, thick, easy to use and leave you feeling clean.  The packages have a resealable sticker so no worries about carrying a zip-lock around.  Highly recommend these.</li>
            <li> Described accurately, delivered quickly, AAA+++ Dealer, Thank You!</li>
            <li> Handy and very sturdy yet soft.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, arrived on time, packaged correctly and arrive in perfect condition.  This is my 3rd order for this product.  I love having these clothes available to freshen up when I want too.  I also love that they are disposable, just use and throw away.  Will definitely reorder again.</li>
            <li> Very good quality -- better than I expected.</li>
            <li> They were perfect! Would buy again!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my 80&#x27;s and although I shower every day, I have trouble reaching and washing my feet.  after&lt;br /&gt;I get out of the shower, I use these disposables and they do the trick.  Delivery is always very&lt;br /&gt;prompt,  they are easy to order and occasionally o n sale..  A great help to senior citizens at home&lt;br /&gt;as well as a staple in hospitals. And better and cleaner than a basin!</li>
            <li> We us several of these daily to care for my sensitive skin areas and to clean up a couple of wound beds twice each day.  Very good for  the skin integrity when used prior to applying bandages with tape.</li>
            <li> These wipes are great for people with limited ability to use tub or shower, especially when warmed. They have a very faint, pleasant scent, and leave no residue on the skin. Great for whole body washing or quick cleanups!</li>
            <li> Found out about these when in the hospital 11 years ago and was given them daily to use while there.  I am elderly and became wheel chair bound and a daily shower is too tough so I searched the internet to find these.  They are not paper but cotton that has been treated and are wonderful to use when sitting down or in bed for ones personal care.  You have to be careful not to overheat them in the microwave because you could burn yourself and also make sure the are opened enough to stay open when heating or soap and moisture will bubble up out into your oven.  They are also good unheated for a quick wash  up.</li>
            <li> There is only 1 store in town that carries these and it&#x27;s not close to me at all so I was happy to find them at Amazon at a ver reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Great product, great price. Cartridges worked perfectly</li>
            <li> These things are great. Can take bath using only two wipes.</li>
            <li> EXCELLENT PRODUCT. BEEN USING IT FOR SOMETIME.  LEARNED ABOUT IT WHEN I WAS IN THE HOSPITAL. THEY HAVE BEEN USING THE SAME PRODUCT EVERYTIME I&#x27;M IN.</li>
            <li> Truly an excellent product. I am recovering from major surgery and desperately needed an atternative to bathing for an extended time. This product proved to be the best.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I ordered these wash cloths. They are fantastic.  Very soft and thick. Moistened and ready to use. I definitely will order them again.</li>
            <li> I am unable to bath myself. Nurse tells me these are so much better than the paper thin &amp;#34;wash cloths&amp;#34; that are sold for bathing. They feel better on my skin also.</li>
            <li> Absolutely one of the best products in the market.  It can be used as is or warmed up in the microwave.  Cleans very well and removes odors.</li>
            <li> thank you  just right</li>
            <li> these were great while hospiltalized.....great at home !</li>
            <li> my dad in a wheelchair and my mom uses them a lot on him</li>
            <li> Very handy while recuperating from ankle surgery.</li>
            <li> it is what I expected</li>
            <li> Very nice for cleaning. My mom is elderly and bathing is a tough area she doesnt like. Good product!</li>
            <li> Fast delivery, great product, happy with purchase!</li>
            <li> Perfect. Gf just had cancer surgery and tgis is what hopkins used.</li>
            <li> If you are disabled, then being clean is even more important.  These thick clothes (when heated for a few seconds in the microwave) create a warm comforting bath and leave you feeling clean and refreshed.</li>
            <li> Does the job in getting you clean, but I experienced two problems:  (1)  actually made my skin feel too sticky, grippy and tacky.  This is something that I totally did not expect, though it beats feeling oily.  (2)  The scent is too strong for my tastes.  Kind of medicinal.  For my money, I really like the No Rinse wipes, as they don&#x27;t have the two downsides that I mentioned.</li>
            <li> Work well, but a bit pricey</li>
            <li> I used these while in the hospital and then at home and they are nice and thick and fairly damp (though not wet). I did not detect any bad or &#x27;medicinal&#x27; odor, which others complained of. However, they are smaller (albeit thicker) than Simply Right Adult Washcloths and seem to leave a slight residue. I still use these for more thorough cleaning, and the Simply Right ones for daily use. They both have their advantages and alternating helps cut the costs since these are pricier.</li>
            <li> Sister uses this product when my elderly mom is unable to take a shower. Good for camping trips too.</li>
            <li> Love this for a comfort, quick cleansing. Purchased for a friend going through chemo and having some very bad days. These disposable washcloths are soft, lightly scented, and very refreshing.</li>
            <li> I bought these for $7 from Preferred Mart, thinking I was getting a good deal.  They did smell better than another brand of antibacterial cloths, and cleaned well.  They were moist and thick.  However, within weeks they became moldy!  I was shocked to discover gray spots on the surface of the top cloth, even though it was stored in an air conditioned room.  The package wasn&#x27;t but about half used and I had to throw it away.  I&#x27;m debating trying them again from a different merchant or buying the other brand.  I wish the manufacturer&#x27;s of these wipes would come up with something that smelled less like a powder room or medicine.  Something herbal or woodsy might be nice.</li>
            <li> I cannot get into our bathtub, so Comfort Bath is a wonderful product for me. Heats up 1 minute and you have eight wash cloths with no rinsing needed. They&#x27;re fabulous if you can&#x27;t get in a shower or bath for whatever reason. Better than any other brand I have tried.</li>
            <li> I have purchased this product before for  my mother who had a stroke and has a hard time in the shower. She loves the product which leaves her feeling fresh and with soft clean skin. Recently, I used a cloth and was surprised at how nice and thick the pad really was. I felt very clean and moisturized.</li>
            <li> Satisfied with product and service.  Thanks.</li>
            <li> EXCELLENT TO USE WHEN SHOWERING IS NOT CONVENIENT.  EASY CLEAN UP AND REFRESHING WITH NO MESS. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THESE.</li>
            <li> If you have to clean up and can&#x27;t get to a sink or shower, these towelettes will serve you well.  I&#x27;m mobility impaired and use these cloths on the no shower days and they are great.</li>
            <li> Awesome!  Make sure you heat them up a little for a much more pleasant experience.  Saved after getting home post surgery. ..........must have!</li>
            <li> Great for my husband who could not shower for 2 weeks following hip surgery.</li>
            <li> I am happy with this product. The reason that I only gave it four stars is because when you put it in the microwave to heat it is very hot and a quick minute later it cools off. That aside, this product works very well, smells wonderful and makes a person feel clean. I would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> .These are just like the ones they give you in the hospital for taking a waterless bath.  They are thick and treated with aloe and other non-irritating ingredients to help you clean quickly and leave you feeling refreshed.  They were essential during my husband&#x27;s recent illness, but also handy for when normal bathing isn&#x27;t practical.</li>
            <li> The wipes came and was ordered for my mom and I think one of the packages leaked a little.&lt;br /&gt;My father wanted to find one like the hospital to help him. Read good reviews about it.</li>
            <li> I take care of my mom sometime who is 84 and she really likes them.  There great for for any kind of clean up.  They are heavy duty and you can use them over and over.</li>
            <li> I had to buy this on the recommendation of my doctor because I could not shower after my surgery for one month.  This cleans very well.  I was not embarrassed to go to my doctors appointments knowing I had not showered.</li>
            <li> These are great for those who are unable to bathe on a regular basis.  My adult some who has sever disabilities and is total care is difficult to bathe more than once a week in the bath tub.  I use these several times a week to keep up with his hygiene needs.  They aren&#x27;t comparable to &amp;#34;wet wipes.:  They are thick, washcloth type disposable cloths.  Microwaving them for several seconds make them nice and warm.</li>
            <li> Purchased for mother.  She is able to clean herself well with these wipes.  Likes them microwaved.  Mom says they clean her well and do not cause her to itch.  Product arrived quickly and is as described</li>
            <li> This was a gift for a sick friend who praises this product and looks forward to buying some for himself.</li>
