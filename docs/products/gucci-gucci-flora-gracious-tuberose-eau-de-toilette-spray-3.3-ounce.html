            <li>Light perfume for a summer day!  </li>
            <li>However,  this is more of a light smell</li>
            <li>This scent is not that strong and stays longer.</li>
            <li>Light and airy.</li>
            <li>It is perfect for everyday.</li>
            <li>Great deal overall!</li>
            <li>Nice smell,  more of a fresh smell, compared to the pink Gardenia one, which is more perfumey, floral...stronger scent (but not over-powering) Which I love more.</li>
            <li>It has a very fresh, floral and feminine fragrance.</li>
            <li>Came in original package, smells great, and didn&#x27;t take long.</li>
            <li>I was so excited when I received it as a gift.</li>
            <li>Most young (at heart) women are probably going to love it.</li>
            <li>It still smells good, but it doesn&#x27;t seem the same.</li>
            <li>Not strong scent that would push people away from you or make everybody twist their forehead, LOL</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend to anyone :)</li>
            <li>I really like this line of fragrances.</li>
            <li>and I have been given this product by the company to review this product and give an honest  opinion based on my everyday experience.</li>
            <li>This way interested buyers can have a  detailed description of its long term use.</li>
            <li>I purchased several of the other scrents as well and all have a light, sweet lasting fragrance.</li>
            <li>Not long lasting though</li>

            <li> My favorite of the floral collection is tuberose. It is perfect for everyday. I love putting it in my hair. I use EO rose and chamomile shampoo and this is a perfect compliment to give my hair a  fragrance  boost. It is not overwhelming and the fragrance is familiar but subtle. I can wear this around other people with out worrying that I am causing harsh allergic reactions in them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: I am a bzzagent and I have been given this product by the company to review this product and give an honest  opinion based on my everyday experience.

            <li> Great deal overall! Came in original package, smells great, and didn&#x27;t take long. I would definitely recommend to anyone :)</li>
            <li> This smelled nothing like the Gucci flora that my friend owns. It smells like roses. I do not like it. Fake!</li>
            <li> Nice smell,  more of a fresh smell, compared to the pink Gardenia one, which is more perfumey, floral...stronger scent (but not over-powering) Which I love more. However,  this is more of a light smell and I like it as well.</li>
            <li> This scent is not that strong and stays longer. My sense of smell get along with this scent. I got a lot of compliments from my co-workers and stated that I always smell good. I will definitely buy this spray again.</li>
            <li> I simply LOVE this perfume! I was so excited when I received it as a gift. It has a very fresh, floral and feminine fragrance. It is best suited for spring and early summer. Most young (at heart) women are probably going to love it.</li>
            <li> I really like this line of fragrances. I purchased several of the other scrents as well and all have a light, sweet lasting fragrance. I can smell it all day. Very pleased.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this is a knock off....To me, it has a powdery smell that the Gracious Tuberose in the store didn&#x27;t have.  It still smells good, but it doesn&#x27;t seem the same.</li>
            <li> Light perfume for a summer day!  Not long lasting though</li>
            <li> nice smell and my gf loved it so cool</li>
