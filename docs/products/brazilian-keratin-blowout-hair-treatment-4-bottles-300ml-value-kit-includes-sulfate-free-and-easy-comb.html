            <li>Now I have my hair nice for weeks</li>
            <li>Love this product,  i never thought it was going to be this good</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own.  </li>
            <li>Best keratin treatment I have tried so far.</li>
            <li>honestly, it comes out better when I do it myself.</li>
            <li>I liked most about this product</li>
            <li>Just buy some good sulfate free shampoo</li>

            <li>She is in love with her products and telling everyone she knows about it.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve already used it twice and still have plenty more product.</li>
            <li>My stylist decided not to do ant more keratin and so I ordered this in hopes of repairing the damage.  </li>
            <li>The results were fantastic!</li>
            <li>They had an overwhelming chemical smell.</li>
            <li>have to say that I really love it, it may have been better in a salon, I can&#x27;t say cause I&#x27;ve never gotten it done at a salon, but it costs $80 with shipping and everything</li>
            <li>Recently I used this treatment and it was awesome!!!!</li>
            <li>When I bought this product I wasn&#x27;t sure about now</li>
            <li>It was so easy.  </li>
            <li>It is so easy to style my hair now, and it doesn&#x27;t frizz out in the rain or humidity.  </li>
            <li>Everything was fine.</li>
            <li>and it came out fine.  </li>
            <li>and my hair still looks great 7 weeks later.</li>
            <li>I want smooth hair.  </li>
            <li>My hair became so shine and smooth &amp;</li>
            <li>This is a fantastic product.  </li>
            <li>My frizz is gone, hair is smooth and silky and I saved over $400 by doing it myself instead of going to salon.  </li>
            <li>and I did not use the high heat recommended and my hair is still nice.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Have fun!</li>
            <li>at the beginning I was scared ( specially that my hair is dyed blond)</li>
            <li>Over all I am very satisfied, it has made my life so much easier not messing with the doo so much.  </li>
            <li>my drying time is much better and my hair much shinier.  </li>
            <li>I was spending so much money on these treatments because my hair looked so much better</li>
            <li>and I really recommend it :)</li>
            <li>have had the treatment in my hair for a full 4 weeks.  </li>
            <li>The smell was not bad.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m white and have fine blond hair, but this is area that has a mind of its own...</li>
            <li>A month later, if I sleep in a braid I have nice wavy, fizz free hair all day.</li>
            <li>My hair&#x27;s been silky smooth, easy to blow dry and straighten, and I just love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>love it so far!</li>
            <li>Overall, fast delivery and good experience.</li>
            <li>So...you have to decide if it&#x27;s worth using.</li>
            <li>The positive reviews are TRUE.</li>
            <li>The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it a perfect score was because one of the bottles slightly leaked in the package.</li>
            <li>I will tell you that the entire process takes around 3 hours but the time saved every morning with having smooth hair is worth it!</li>
            <li>It is super, super soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>My most recent treatment smelled like rotten.eggs</li>
            <li>With this product it has been soft, smooth, and manageable.</li>
            <li>now I&#x27;ve noticed that lately I haven&#x27;t been getting great results.</li>
            <li>Haha!</li>
            <li>I only used 350 degrees per someone else&#x27;s recommendation for people with fine hair and that worked super well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my first time getting a keratin done, I did it myself</li>
            <li>Definitely will use again:)</li>
            <li>The first week it was great, very straight and little curls when drying natural.  </li>
            <li>We tried this on her, and right after she went on vacation, so her hair have been exposed to salt water, and pool water, and still a month  a half later it still looks and feels great.</li>
            <li>Keratin product is expensive, but more importantly, the more product you put in your hair the more times you have to run through your hair with a flat iron.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Another positive thing, my hair wasn&#x27;t super greasy like I&#x27;ve seen other people&#x27;s hair while the have the keratin in their hairs and that I loved, that&#x27;s one of the reasons I left it for 3 days, I had no reason to wash it because it looked just fine&lt;</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s a pretty good offer and that it does work as it says, or at least that&#x27;s my experience, AND I&#x27;M NOT BEING PAID TO SAY THAT.</li>
            <li>The bottle with keratin itself is good enough for 3-4 times to use even with my long hair.</li>
            <li>have fine, blonde, curly/wavy hair.</li>
            <li>Really works</li>
            <li>and afterwards my hair was very damaged</li>
            <li>Still use a lot of argan oil but thanks to this product</li>
            <li>I have had keratin treatments at the salon on this spot of hair and my hair comes out beautifully straight.  </li>
            <li>The whole process is timely.</li>
            <li>I use the shampoo and condition which I really like as well.</li>
            <li>was that it didn&#x27;t leave my hair stick straight.</li>
            <li>read the instructions very well..</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t Do That Much Difference</li>
            <li>This product was better then I expected.  </li>
            <li>I now have to iron my hair after blow drying it when it&#x27;s very humid.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;You need to be in a very highly ventilated area, I had the exhaust fan on, a window open and another fan blowing directly on me pushing the fumes towards the window and exhaust  Strong smell when applying the solution.  </li>
            <li>My hair honestly feels like a little kids!  </li>
            <li>My hair still has a wave, but its less curly and very very smooth.</li>
            <li>The treatments never lasted as long and my hair was never as smooth as before.</li>
            <li>I was worried that I was going to suffer breakage because my hair is so fine and dry.</li>
            <li>I was a little reluctant about using an in-home product but found it pretty easy to use.  </li>
            <li>I did tear up just a little but make sure your area is well ventilated.</li>
            <li>Awesome for ugly hair.  </li>
            <li>A few tips,  wear gloves,  open a window,  once you blowdry your hair the second time you can really smell the fumes but when your done straightening your hair it has a pleasant coconut smell.</li>
            <li>I live in 105ยบ+ no matter what you do,  5 minutes out</li>
            <li>Looks very natural.</li>
            <li>I decided to try this because I got very lazy with making sure my hair would be straight according to my definition.</li>
            <li>Feels soft and normal.</li>
            <li>I have straight hair that gets a little wavy on the back of my head and had it professionally straightened many times before.</li>
            <li>My hair is also extremely soft, I&#x27;ve never had hair this soft ib my life!</li>
            <li>I did my long hair, and my daughter&#x27;s mid length hair, and still have enough for a couple more applications.  </li>
            <li>I have unruly natural curly hair keratin cuts my drying time from 20 minutes to 5 and hair</li>
            <li>While the product did relax it a bit, it is definitely not anywhere close to being straight.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been getting professional Keratin treatments and Brazilian blowouts for about 3 years</li>
            <li>All the frizz is gone and my hair feels soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>i followed the instructions on the bottle and so far my hair has been frizz free and way straighter than usual.</li>
            <li>24 hours later I rinsed my hair and it looked and felt exactly the same as before, no difference whatsoever.</li>
            <li>My hair is past my shoulders and I have 5 more applications left.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended for curly, problem non African</li>
            <li>hair is very very curly and thick and fine when dry.  </li>
            <li>It used to take me an hour or more to blow dry my hair from wet to \\&quot;straight\\&quot; and it would be puffy and frizzy and I would have to use the flat iron in my roots..</li>
            <li>This one is very good,lasted three months on my long hair,together with shampoo and conditioner from the set.</li>
            <li>(Like not using too much product or it will dry out</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t work quite as well on my hair as previous in-salon experiences I have had, but it is worth it compared to paying $200-$300 a pop each time</li>
            <li>I have very long thick frizzy curly hair, so I didnt really get my hopes up for huge results.</li>
            <li>It now takes about 10 minutes to get it very straight, and I can often just leave it down with no hair product in it at all after the shower.</li>
            <li>I still have enough product left to treat my hair at least 4 more times.</li>
            <li>much coloring ad bleaching), and extremely frizzy...</li>
            <li>followed the instructions very carefully, the whole process took about 4 or 5 hours.</li>
            <li>It left enough volume in my hair to where it isn&#x27;t sticking flat to my head, but i could make it pin straight with one pass of the flat iron.</li>
            <li>and my gosh, it dried totally straight!  </li>
            <li>But no problem because it stays straight and gets a slight wave afterward ironing.  </li>
            <li>So far I haven&#x27;t used the flat iron at all, i just blow dry and comb it</li>

            <li> It didn&#x27;t work quite as well on my hair as previous in-salon experiences I have had, but it is worth it compared to paying $200-$300 a pop each time</li>

            <li> followed the instructions very carefully, the whole process took about 4 or 5 hours.</li>
            <li> It left enough volume in my hair to where it isn&#x27;t sticking flat to my head, but i could make it pin straight with one pass of the flat iron.</li>
            <li> and my gosh, it dried totally straight!  </li>
            <li> But no problem because it stays straight and gets a slight wave afterward ironing.  </li>
            <li> So far I haven&#x27;t used the flat iron at all, i just blow dry and comb it</li>
            <li> The entire procedure took about 3-4 hours (the flat ironing takes the longest to do it correctly).  </li>

            <li> I could never just let it dry and leave it.</li>
            <li> so my hair has changed texture to where the ends are always dry</li>
            <li> I read every single review.</li>
            <li> and I do not straighten it in small pieces with the circular brush unless I want the ends to look curvy and natural..</li>
            <li> The initial treatment helped but I also continued to put a small amount on it before styling for the next couple of weeks which also helped.  </li>
            <li> I was terrified at the results letting it dry on it&#x27;s own because usually I look very scary when I do this</li>
            <li> As soon as she got them, which by the way was faster than expected, she had to try them.</li>
            <li> This product is a friend and asked me what I expected</li>
            <li> my hair is just wavy not really curly.</li>
            <li> I would suggest being careful with your eyes while applying this product and also blowdrying.</li>
            <li> READ READ the advice other people write in these reviews.</li>
            <li> , I recommend JUST buying the treatment, not all the other bottles.</li>
            <li> Extremely curly and puffy when getting out of the pool and not blowing it out.  </li>
            <li> so I needed to find a different salon to do my treatments, and ever since I moved I have tried 5 or 6 different salons and the results were never great.</li>
            <li> My natural hair is thin and POOFY, kinky, unmanageable, etc.</li>
            <li> Curls are slowly coming back.  </li>
            <li> I use ethnic hair oils to keep the frizz down  and get a comb through it also.  </li>
            <li> I used to get brazilion blowouts which are so expensive and it would only last about 6wks before it stated to frizz and curl.</li>
            <li> Will try it again, but first treatment was quite disappointing.</li>
            <li> A little background about my hair...</li>
            <li> still haven&#x27;t let my hair dry by itself without using the blow dryer, but I blow dry my hair in 20 minutes and it&#x27;s  straight without looking flat and boring!</li>
            <li> I had to evacuate the shower coughing and crying and threw them out immediately.</li>
            <li> what a waste of money!</li>
            <li> This product reduce the frizz i would usually get after washing my hair, reduce blowdrying time and gave me the results I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had hair disasters in the past and am SOOOOO hesitant to do any at home hair treatment.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s EASIER to blowdry and straighten and frizz is a thing of the past, but I still have volume.</li>
            <li> Before this, I always had to straighten my hair for at least an hour, and then touch it up midway through the day.</li>
            <li> At your neck and around your face go over hair at least 10 times!  </li>
            <li> i did everything the directions said step by step and the product did as advertised for approximately 3-4 days.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> After using the hair treatment from Portier, I decided to give a try to this product. In summary, it is just a waist of time, and didn&#x27;t work at all. I like the shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> These products I bought were for my mother. As soon as she got them, which by the way was faster than expected, she had to try them. She said that just the shampoo and rinse alone are like getting the keratin treatment done. She is in love with her products and telling everyone she knows about it. She is happy !</li>
            <li> Love it. Really works</li>
            <li> This product is a friend and asked me what I expected</li>
            <li> Great product and amazing results. Best keratin treatment I have tried so far. The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it a perfect score was because one of the bottles slightly leaked in the package.</li>
            <li> I love this! I would spend $160 + tip to get my hair done and honestly, it comes out better when I do it myself. I&#x27;ve already used it twice and still have plenty more product. What a great value!</li>
            <li> Very impressed.  I had had several keratin treatments at salons and this one was comparable to the others.  My most recent treatment smelled like rotten.eggs and afterwards my hair was very damaged and I had a lot of breakage.  My stylist decided not to do ant more keratin and so I ordered this in hopes of repairing the damage.  The initial treatment helped but I also continued to put a small amount on it before styling for the next couple of weeks which also helped.  Still use a lot of argan oil but thanks to this product my drying time is much better and my hair much shinier.  I have unruly natural curly hair keratin cuts my drying time from 20 minutes to 5 and hair doesn&#x27;t frizz on humid days.  I don&#x27;t see myself without keratin treatments and I will definitely  buy this product  again.</li>
            <li> I have very long thick frizzy curly hair, so I didnt really get my hopes up for huge results. Before this, I always had to straighten my hair for at least an hour, and then touch it up midway through the day. I could never just let it dry and leave it. This product DOES sting and burn your eyes and throat if you dont have enough ventilation, but it worked!! My hair still has a wave, but its less curly and very very smooth. It now takes about 10 minutes to get it very straight, and I can often just leave it down with no hair product in it at all after the shower. Its smoother and shinier than its ever been.  I will definitely be using this again.</li>
            <li> i did everything the directions said step by step and the product did as advertised for approximately 3-4 days. my hair is just wavy not really curly. what a waste of money!</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product! I have long hair and it gives me about four treatments. I used to get brazilion blowouts which are so expensive and it would only last about 6wks before it stated to frizz and curl. With this it last twice as long! It has never been more shiny and healthy and beautiful! I have biracial hair. Works on all hair types.  Will continue to buy. Cheaper and better! Win win.</li>
            <li> love it so far! i followed the instructions on the bottle and so far my hair has been frizz free and way straighter than usual. My natural hair is thin and POOFY, kinky, unmanageable, etc. With this product it has been soft, smooth, and manageable. It left enough volume in my hair to where it isn&#x27;t sticking flat to my head, but i could make it pin straight with one pass of the flat iron. So far I haven&#x27;t used the flat iron at all, i just blow dry and comb it and it&#x27;s perfect in my opinion. Looks very natural. It has only been two days since i washed out the formula, though. Will update my review in a month, or whenever the magic starts to fade.. hopefully it will be a while!</li>
            <li> It worked well, my hair turned out mote managable after the treatment.</li>
            <li> I bought this product to straighten a patch of hair that I have that is exceptionally curly.  I&#x27;m white and have fine blond hair, but this is area that has a mind of its own... presumably a birth mark of sorts. While the product did relax it a bit, it is definitely not anywhere close to being straight.  I have had keratin treatments at the salon on this spot of hair and my hair comes out beautifully straight.  I followed the same procedures and didn&#x27;t wash my hair for over 48 hours, so this is not operator error.  Will try it again, but first treatment was quite disappointing.</li>
            <li> I decided to try this because I got very lazy with making sure my hair would be straight according to my definition. This product reduce the frizz i would usually get after washing my hair, reduce blowdrying time and gave me the results I was looking for. I would suggest being careful with your eyes while applying this product and also blowdrying. I did tear up just a little but make sure your area is well ventilated.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy with results that this product gave me. I&#x27;ve been getting professional Keratin treatments and Brazilian blowouts for about 3 years now I&#x27;ve noticed that lately I haven&#x27;t been getting great results. I moved about two years ago so I needed to find a different salon to do my treatments, and ever since I moved I have tried 5 or 6 different salons and the results were never great. The treatments never lasted as long and my hair was never as smooth as before. I came to the conclusion that is because salons were trying to save product by only putting a sparse amount of product in my hair. Keratin product is expensive, but more importantly, the more product you put in your hair the more times you have to run through your hair with a flat iron. The whole process is timely. Of course you don&#x27;t want to saturate your hair with product either. I was spending so much money on these treatments because my hair looked so much better after is was done, and I was chasing the results that I had prior to my move. Anyway, I decided to buy this and do it on myself. The results were fantastic! I added enough product without saturating it and the results are like what I had before I moved. I even went on vacation to Thailand and was in pool water and ocean water for 3 weeks and my hair still looks great 7 weeks later. I use the shampoo and condition which I really like as well. I still have enough product left to treat my hair at least 4 more times. I need to reorder the shampoo and conditioner. I will tell you that the entire process takes around 3 hours but the time saved every morning with having smooth hair is worth it! I do recommend buying a dye brush to apply the product.</li>
            <li> OMG, just buy it already! Haha! BEST thing I&#x27;ve done for my hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did hours of research on this product. I read every single review. I&#x27;ve had hair disasters in the past and am SOOOOO hesitant to do any at home hair treatment. But keratin treatments at the salon are so expensive!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did the treatment 3 months ago and am still loving it! My hair&#x27;s been silky smooth, easy to blow dry and straighten, and I just love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have fine, blonde, curly/wavy hair. I was worried that I was going to suffer breakage because my hair is so fine and dry. But nope! Everything was fine. I only used 350 degrees per someone else&#x27;s recommendation for people with fine hair and that worked super well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m toxinphobic so I was worried about the chemical smell everyone talked about. I did this by an open door with a fan on me and couldn&#x27;t smell anything. Yay!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I liked most about this product was that it didn&#x27;t leave my hair stick straight. It&#x27;s EASIER to blowdry and straighten and frizz is a thing of the past, but I still have volume. A month later, if I sleep in a braid I have nice wavy, fizz free hair all day. Ideal!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;READ READ READ the advice other people write in these reviews. GREAT advice on applying the product. (Like not using too much product or it will dry out your hair).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I recommend JUST buying the treatment, not all the other bottles. They had an overwhelming chemical smell. I had to evacuate the shower coughing and crying and threw them out immediately. Just buy some good sulfate free shampoo and you&#x27;re good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have fun!</li>
            <li> A little background about my hair... It&#x27;s curly and dry(too much coloring ad bleaching), and extremely frizzy... And I&#x27;ve never gotten a keratin treatment done before, either at home or in the salon...&lt;br /&gt;I loved the product.. It&#x27;s my first time getting a keratin done, I did it myself and I left it for 3 days even though you can wash it the next morning, I just wanna be sure it would be nice...&lt;br /&gt;I still haven&#x27;t let my hair dry by itself without using the blow dryer, but I blow dry my hair in 20 minutes and it&#x27;s  straight without looking flat and boring! It used to take me an hour or more to blow dry my hair from wet to \\&quot;straight\\&quot; and it would be puffy and frizzy and I would have to use the flat iron in my roots.. My hair is also extremely soft, I&#x27;ve never had hair this soft ib my life! I&#x27;m using the shampoo and conditioner that comes with the keratin and I bought the Moroccan oil, those are the things that I apply in my hair and I do not straighten it in small pieces with the circular brush unless I want the ends to look curvy and natural..&lt;br /&gt;I have to say that I really love it, it may have been better in a salon, I can&#x27;t say cause I&#x27;ve never gotten it done at a salon, but it costs $80 with shipping and everything and it brings the shampoo and conditioner and it has enough treatment to get it done twice I think it&#x27;s a pretty good offer and that it does work as it says, or at least that&#x27;s my experience, AND I&#x27;M NOT BEING PAID TO SAY THAT. Lol that&#x27;s my real review I&#x27;ve not been paid or hired in any way to say that I&#x27;m just a happy costumer.. And remember it also varies in the way you do it... Of ur gonna get it done read the instructions very well..&lt;br /&gt;Another positive thing, my hair wasn&#x27;t super greasy like I&#x27;ve seen other people&#x27;s hair while the have the keratin in their hairs and that I loved, that&#x27;s one of the reasons I left it for 3 days, I had no reason to wash it because it looked just fine&lt;br /&gt;I hope it helps and I really recommend it :)</li>
            <li> I was a little reluctant about using an in-home product but found it pretty easy to use.  It didn&#x27;t work quite as well on my hair as previous in-salon experiences I have had, but it is worth it compared to paying $200-$300 a pop each time I want smooth hair.  Overall, fast delivery and good experience.</li>
            <li> I love the results! A few tips,  wear gloves,  open a window,  once you blowdry your hair the second time you can really smell the fumes but when your done straightening your hair it has a pleasant coconut smell. At your neck and around your face go over hair at least 10 times!  I live in 105ยบ+ no matter what you do,  5 minutes out side &amp; you&#x27;re sweating,  I haven&#x27;t had a problem with my hair going curly in these areas!  When I would straighten my hair before the treatment it would always go curly in the heat.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t Do That Much Difference On Ur hair</li>
            <li> Awesome for ugly hair.  I did a sloppy job and it came out fine.  Feels soft and normal.</li>
            <li> Recently I used this treatment and it was awesome!!!! My hair became so shine and smooth &amp;#60;3 I am definitely going to buy it again!!!</li>
            <li> This product was better then I expected.  It was so easy.  I followed the directions and got excellent results and I did not use the high heat recommended and my hair is still nice.</li>
            <li> Have done blowout several times befote.This one is very good,lasted three months on my long hair,together with shampoo and conditioner from the set.The bottle with keratin itself is good enough for 3-4 times to use even with my long hair.It was done to me by my friend so you will need help.Definitely will use again:)</li>
            <li> I have straight hair that gets a little wavy on the back of my head and had it professionally straightened many times before. I decided to give this product a try after reading that you can rinse your hair the very next day instead of waiting for three days.&lt;br /&gt;I followed the instructions very carefully, the whole process took about 4 or 5 hours. 24 hours later I rinsed my hair and it looked and felt exactly the same as before, no difference whatsoever.</li>
            <li> This product is definitely effective.  However, what I didn&#x27;t realize until I was already using the product is that it contains formaldehyde.  So...you have to decide if it&#x27;s worth using.</li>
            <li> I have never had a Keratin treatment before but a friend of mine has and she spends a LOT of money on them. I am 46 so my hair has changed texture to where the ends are always dry no matter what I use.  Trust me, I have tried everything!! The entire procedure took about 3-4 hours (the flat ironing takes the longest to do it correctly).  My hair honestly feels like a little kids!  It is super, super soft and shiny. I was terrified at the results letting it dry on it&#x27;s own because usually I look very scary when I do this and my gosh, it dried totally straight!  LOVE, LOVE this product!!!</li>
            <li> Now I have my hair nice for weeks</li>
            <li> toook 3 hours. FOllow directions ad ans read thouroughly.</li>
            <li> My mom had her hair done in a salon, and it did not have good results at all. We tried this on her, and right after she went on vacation, so her hair have been exposed to salt water, and pool water, and still a month  a half later it still looks and feels great.</li>
            <li> Love this product,  i never thought it was going to be this good</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic product.  My frizz is gone, hair is smooth and silky and I saved over $400 by doing it myself instead of going to salon.  The smell was not bad.  It is so easy to style my hair now, and it doesn&#x27;t frizz out in the rain or humidity.  I did my long hair, and my daughter&#x27;s mid length hair, and still have enough for a couple more applications.  Very happy!</li>
            <li> It is great, easily applied on hair with awesome results :)</li>
            <li> Highly recommended for curly, problem non African hair.&lt;br /&gt;My hair is very very curly and thick and fine when dry.  I use ethnic hair oils to keep the frizz down  and get a comb through it also.  Extremely curly and puffy when getting out of the pool and not blowing it out.  have had the treatment in my hair for a full 4 weeks.  The first week it was great, very straight and little curls when drying natural.  Curls are slowly coming back.  I now have to iron my hair after blow drying it when it&#x27;s very humid.  Because my hair is nuts, like it has a brain of it&#x27;s own.  But no problem because it stays straight and gets a slight wave afterward ironing.  I will have to reapply in about 2 weeks, but that&#x27;s what it says, 4 -6 weeks.  Over all I am very satisfied, it has made my life so much easier not messing with the doo so much.  I also wash my hair every day, but do not make a big lather, just enough to refresh my scalp.  My hair is past my shoulders and I have 5 more applications left.  I have used brazil blowout before it was banned and this works just as great. Next time though, I will start with the front.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You need to be in a very highly ventilated area, I had the exhaust fan on, a window open and another fan blowing directly on me pushing the fumes towards the window and exhaust  Strong smell when applying the solution.  But no problems when ironing because the smoke from ironing went upwards into the exhaust.  And the gloves are necessity.  Try to keep the solution off your skin as much as possible.  The positive reviews are TRUE.</li>
            <li> Love this product!! Wont lie to you.....at the beginning I was scared ( specially that my hair is dyed blond) but I tried it , and I love it!! Definitively, would recommend this Brazilian Keratin Hair Treatment!! It&#x27;s worthy to spend the money!!!</li>
            <li> When I bought this product I wasn&#x27;t sure about now I am glad that I did because I had amazing results.&lt;br /&gt;Katia</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product. All the frizz is gone and my hair feels soft and shiny.</li>
