            <li>They are not just for bald heads, they would work as well, and be handy for sun protection on any exposed skin.</li>
            <li>I love these handy packets.  </li>
            <li>I love the idea of these.  </li>
            <li>ordered 3 boxes by accident and am glad I did.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;There was a mistake in the first shipping, but the company had prompt, courteous &amp; satisfactory customer service!</li>

            <li>Thanks for a good product</li>
            <li>I like it because it is easy to carry.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>Easy to carry.</li>
            <li>easy to stash everywhere:</li>
            <li>We LOVED the old SunX towelettes!</li>
            <li>Besides being very effective, it is very easy to apply, is not greasy, is absorbed by your skin, dries in a very short period of time and does not attract dirt while you work.  </li>
            <li>And good and safe enough for kids with out any reaction since one of my kids</li>
            <li>We loved the older SunX wipes, as they had the sunscreen right on the wipes -- it was easy and convenient to apply.</li>
            <li>I was already familiar with this product and Amazon</li>
            <li>Even if you only use it on your face you are doing yourself a world of good.  </li>
            <li>I have ordered these before for our young kids, were super easy to use.  </li>
            <li>These are just the right size, with just the right amount of suncreen for a day.</li>
            <li>sure enough here it is!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>These towelettes are a MUCH easier way to get sunscreen on my toddler!</li>
            <li>, I was glad to find these individual towelettes with 30 spf protection.</li>
            <li>Maybe make a separate line for those who might be interested?</li>
            <li>These are handy to use, lotion in one packet and towelette in the other.  </li>
            <li>These are ok, but we prefer the single pack towelette vs having to put the lotion on (pack #1) and then spread with the wipe (pack #2).</li>
            <li>/&gt;Might as well just buy sun screen in a bottle and apply it by hand, it would be much cheaper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I highly recommend them!</li>
            <li>The lotion and the Towel are separated so I don&#x27;t see the whole purposes&lt;</li>
            <li>They should go back to the original towellette design that had sunscreen in the towelette instead of separate.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Bring back the original product.</li>
            <li>have super sensitive skin!thanks for this great product worth every penny!with out the crazy prices for sensitive skin!</li>
            <li>If the company decides to go back to the original design, a towelette saturated with sunscreen for easy application to children and especially to your facial area, let us know</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it</li>
            <li>Work very well and easy to pack a few in the car, boat, rv, backpack, etc</li>
            <li>and I found it to much more effective than several other sunscreen products of different manufacturer that had been provided previously.</li>
            <li>My husband is outside a lot in hot SC, so he needs sun protection on his bald head.  </li>
            <li>How is this any more convenient than carrying a small bottle of lotion?</li>
            <li>The sun only ruins your skin in so many ways.  </li>
            <li>Each one of these is large enough to do face, neck, arms, legs and still have some for the rest.  </li>
            <li>Living in a very sunny part of Southern California, sunscreen is a must.</li>

            <li> only reason I didn&#x27;t give them 5 stars was that my new shipment (box of 50) comes with a double pack - one half is the sunscreen, one half is a &amp;#34;utility towelette&amp;#34; (see the picture on this listing and you can see this).</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I did not read the fine print...</li>
            <li> Instead I was sent a two packet system, one containing lotion and another containing a dry towelette  serving no purpose.</li>
            <li> These are just packets of sunscreen cream with a dry towelette attached in a separate packet.  </li>
            <li> Either way, doesn&#x27;t seem necessary for me, and I don&#x27;t like the waste of having these that I&#x27;ll likely just throw away.</li>
            <li> I thought I was ordering single dose moist towelettes.  </li>
            <li> Come to find out the industry is no longer allowed to make the single dose premoistened product due to government regulation.</li>
            <li> We ran out for a few days, and had to use regular sunscreen and was reminded of what a pain it is.</li>
            <li> Not at all what I expected.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re a dual pack of sunscreen lotion and a wet wipe.</li>
            <li> They are not what I expected.  </li>
            <li> This newer version gives you a packet of sunscreen and a separate &amp;#34;utility towel.&amp;#34; It&#x27;s a lot less convenient, and it eliminates SunX&#x27;s big advantage over everyday sunscreen in a bottle.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if the new sunscreen laws mean they can&#x27;t sell the sunscreen wipes anymore or if the company just wasn&#x27;t making money on them, but I&#x27;ve searched and can no longer find them.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a dry towelette - I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s to wipe sweat and dirt off before you sunscreen (it says &amp;#34;prepare yourself&amp;#34; on it) or to wipe sunscreen off fingers where you&#x27;re done.</li>
            <li> This is NOT sunscreen in a towelette form, instead it is a small packet of liquid sunscreen and a seperate DRY towelette</li>
            <li> My previous brand appears to be off the market, and I don&#x27;t like having to rub in lotions or creams.&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you need color go get a spray on tan or use a little makeup.  </li>
            <li> these little guys are with me all the time.  </li>
            <li> SunX Sunscreen was provided to me by a past employer</li>
            <li> Convenient to say the least.</li>
            <li> Surprisingly not oily gives a dewy complexion.</li>
            <li> When people ask for my secret I always tell them sun block</li>
            <li> We believe it is an absurd product!  </li>
            <li> the separate packs are terrible.  </li>
            <li> Why, why, why, WHY would they change them to this terrible format?</li>

            <li> My husband works outdoors and had been warned to wear sunscreen daily by his dermatologist.&lt;br /&gt;These towelettes are not messy and they have a slight aroma of the beach.  Also, we have four&lt;br /&gt;young grandsons that swim in our pool almost daily that we use these on.  Thanks for a good product&lt;br /&gt;that removes my fear of skin damage.</li>
            <li> I like it because it is easy to carry. Surprisingly not oily gives a dewy complexion. I highly recommend it</li>
            <li> Great!handy!great! Handy! And good and safe enough for kids with out any reaction since one of my kids have super sensitive skin!thanks for this great product worth every penny!with out the crazy prices for sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> So handy to have around. I passed these out to my family to keep in their golf bags and purses. I even keep it in my car.</li>
            <li> I love these Sunscreen Towelettes!  Very convenient, good price, and no nasty chemicals.  Work very well and easy to pack a few in the car, boat, rv, backpack, etc</li>
            <li> Easy to use. Easy to carry. Great for things like skiing. I will always have these around the house for now on.</li>
            <li> I love the idea of these.  I was chatting with no how we wish we could invent a product like this and I said &amp;#34;I bet amazon has one already&amp;#34; sure enough here it is!&lt;br /&gt;I ordered 3 boxes by accident and am glad I did.  These are so handy.  I can&#x27;t even explain how great these are to travel with.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with service and product. These towelettes are a perfect addition to my convertible for those spontaneous days that beckon a top-down experience and a little sun block protection!</li>
            <li> I have ordered these before for our young kids, were super easy to use.  For some reason they no longer ship pre-treated towelettes.  Now you get the towelettes and a packet of sun screen that you have to apply to the towelettes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Might as well just buy sun screen in a bottle and apply it by hand, it would be much cheaper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would NOT recommend.</li>
            <li> These towelettes are a MUCH easier way to get sunscreen on my toddler! We ran out for a few days, and had to use regular sunscreen and was reminded of what a pain it is. Effective, non-greasy, non-smelly, all good.&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I didn&#x27;t give them 5 stars was that my new shipment (box of 50) comes with a double pack - one half is the sunscreen, one half is a &amp;#34;utility towelette&amp;#34; (see the picture on this listing and you can see this). It&#x27;s a dry towelette - I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s to wipe sweat and dirt off before you sunscreen (it says &amp;#34;prepare yourself&amp;#34; on it) or to wipe sunscreen off fingers where you&#x27;re done. Either way, doesn&#x27;t seem necessary for me, and I don&#x27;t like the waste of having these that I&#x27;ll likely just throw away.</li>
            <li> My husband is outside a lot in hot SC, so he needs sun protection on his bald head.  These are handy to use, lotion in one packet and towelette in the other.  He keeps them in the fridge so they are cooling as well.  They are not just for bald heads, they would work as well, and be handy for sun protection on any exposed skin.</li>
            <li> the separate packs are terrible.  They should go back to the original towellette design that had sunscreen in the towelette instead of separate.</li>
            <li> This product is misrepresented. Do not be fooled! This is NOT sunscreen in a towelette form, instead it is a small packet of liquid sunscreen and a seperate DRY towelette</li>
            <li> We purchased these to put in our care packages that my son makes for the homeless. Living in a very sunny part of Southern California, sunscreen is a must. These are just the right size, with just the right amount of suncreen for a day. I highly recommend them!</li>
            <li> SunX Sunscreen was provided to me by a past employer and I found it to much more effective than several other sunscreen products of different manufacturer that had been provided previously. Besides being very effective, it is very easy to apply, is not greasy, is absorbed by your skin, dries in a very short period of time and does not attract dirt while you work.  One towel contains enough product to apply to your face, neck, ears and arms and will last for several hours.  I was already familiar with this product and Amazon had the best price.</li>
            <li> I have had skin cancer on both sides of my face, so I apply a 50 spf on my face. But I like a 30 spf for my arms &amp; chest.&lt;br /&gt;Thus, I was glad to find these individual towelettes with 30 spf protection. My previous brand appears to be off the market, and I don&#x27;t like having to rub in lotions or creams.&lt;br /&gt;There was a mistake in the first shipping, but the company had prompt, courteous &amp; satisfactory customer service!</li>
            <li> I felt that these wipes were inadequate for good application.  I wished that they were more saturated so that I could get more surface area covered.  I used 2-3 just to apply to my arms, neck, and chest area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, they were fairly odorless, non-greasy, and seemed effective - I didn&#x27;t get any burns.</li>
            <li> Not at all what I expected.  I wanted one towelette to use for each application.  These are a towelette plus a separate cream pack.  It is not an all in one product.</li>
            <li> Beware: The sunscreen is separate from the wipes. It is not &amp;#34;all-in-one&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I did not read the fine print...I thought I was buying towelettes with the sunscreen already on them--These are ok, but we prefer the single pack towelette vs having to put the lotion on (pack #1) and then spread with the wipe (pack #2).</li>
            <li> I recommend these towelettes.  I use them 24/7 rain or shine.  They go on light, they are never greasy and at my age I still get compliments for having nice skin.  When people ask for my secret I always tell them sun block and they think that I am joking.  If you need color go get a spray on tan or use a little makeup.  The sun only ruins your skin in so many ways.  Even if you only use it on your face you are doing yourself a world of good.  I love these handy packets.  I never leave home without one or two stashed in my bag.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s where I keep them.  Living in the sun and enjoying the outdoors these little guys are with me all the time.  Convenient to say the least.</li>
            <li> Each one of these is large enough to do face, neck, arms, legs and still have some for the rest.  Amazing!  No one had any reactions to them at all.</li>
            <li> I thought I was ordering single dose moist towelettes.  Instead I was sent a two packet system, one containing lotion and another containing a dry towelette  serving no purpose. I loved the premoistened towelettes but do not like the two packet system.  Come to find out the industry is no longer allowed to make the single dose premoistened product due to government regulation.</li>
            <li> We believe it is an absurd product!  We returned our purchase and would never consider buying it again!  If the company decides to go back to the original design, a towelette saturated with sunscreen for easy application to children and especially to your facial area, let us know cause we&#x27;d buy it in a heartbeat!</li>
            <li> non-greasy&lt;br /&gt;doesn&#x27;t stink&lt;br /&gt;portable- easy to stash everywhere: at desk, in purses/backpacks, in travel gear, in hiking shorts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find one towel is good for hands, face, neck, arms.  Maybe open a second one for legs too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You won&#x27;t regret this purchase, and you&#x27;ll have enough to supply your friends too.</li>
            <li> We loved the older SunX wipes, as they had the sunscreen right on the wipes -- it was easy and convenient to apply. This newer version gives you a packet of sunscreen and a separate &amp;#34;utility towel.&amp;#34; It&#x27;s a lot less convenient, and it eliminates SunX&#x27;s big advantage over everyday sunscreen in a bottle.</li>
            <li> The lotion and the Towel are separated so I don&#x27;t see the whole purposes&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No different than using a paper towel and a bottle of lotion</li>
            <li> These are not sunscreen towelettes... They&#x27;re a dual pack of sunscreen lotion and a wet wipe. I&#x27;m not sure if the new sunscreen laws mean they can&#x27;t sell the sunscreen wipes anymore or if the company just wasn&#x27;t making money on them, but I&#x27;ve searched and can no longer find them.</li>
            <li> They are not what I expected.  I was trying to reorder the pre-moistened sunscreen towelettes I had ordered before.  These are just packets of sunscreen cream with a dry towelette attached in a separate packet.  I only intend to use them in an emergency when nothing else is available.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My fault for not reading the description thoroughly before ordering.</li>
            <li> We LOVED the old SunX towelettes! Why, why, why, WHY would they change them to this terrible format? How is this any more convenient than carrying a small bottle of lotion? It isn&#x27;t. Maybe make a separate line for those who might be interested? Sure, why not. Except it sucks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bring back the original product.</li>
