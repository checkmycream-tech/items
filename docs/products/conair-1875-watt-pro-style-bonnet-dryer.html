            <li>I am totally pleased with the Conair HH400 Collapsable Bonnet Hair Dryer!!  </li>
            <li>We love them!!</li>
            <li>Very, very nice product.</li>
            <li>but it dries evenly and was told it was very effective.  </li>
            <li>TO BE REAL CREATIVE)</li>
            <li>Wonderful dryer, works perfectly fine.</li>
            <li>I feel the Conair HH400 Bonnet Hair Dryer is a good buy for the price, works well.  </li>
            <li>Therefore it&#x27;s a good value</li>
            <li>This is a good price hair dryer.</li>
            <li>and i loved it.</li>
            <li>For me, I can shout it to the world, this dryer is a good dryer</li>
            <li>I was unsure when I bought this hair dryer because of the price, I had been looking for a good hair dryer and came upon this one, I bought it</li>
            <li>my mother loved her Christmas gift</li>
            <li>Good price.</li>
            <li>Good purchase.</li>
            <li>Good purchase.</li>
            <li>Good heat.  </li>
            <li>Of all the hood dryers available for sale here, this seems to be the best.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Opening and closing the dryer takes a minute to learn then you are good to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>It does a fair job</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t understand conair is a good brand.</li>
            <li>And it didn&#x27;t feel particularly good to have the dryer then collapse on my head, after the latch wouldn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>The adjustable height made it so I have a perfect fit</li>
            <li>A good dryer.</li>
            <li>Have not figured  out to close.dries your hair really good.</li>
            <li>guess that can be a good thing though..</li>
            <li>Good dryer.</li>
            <li>and I still use it because I&#x27;m still searching for a good hair dryer.</li>
            <li>I suspect a good machine would cost $100 at a minimum.</li>
            <li>I know a lot of people will probably think this isn&#x27;t a good idea because it is still heat</li>
            <li>Good dryer</li>
            <li>Had many hair dryer before but this is the best ,easy to handle ,easy to closed,easy to storage, I&#x27;M so happy with this item best purchase !</li>
            <li>item is great, works beautifully its so easy to stored away ...</li>
            <li>and I also like the fact that it is compact so its really easy to store away when not in use,like under my bed!!</li>
            <li>Its great for getting the most outta looking good.  </li>
            <li>I Love Love Love this dryer!!!!!!</li>
            <li>This product works fine and the price is very good.</li>
            <li>but I am very glad I did.  </li>
            <li>I am very satisfied with this dryer (&amp; the price)and would recommend it to anyone looking for one.</li>
            <li>So very glad Amazon had this product.</li>
            <li>I am very satisfied with this dryer.</li>
            <li>This product arrived in great condition and I am pleased to say it lives up to my expectations.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very glad</li>
            <li>that if it had stayed on it would have FRIED the hair on the very top of my head while leaving the rest of my hair wet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am very satisfied with my purchase.  </li>
            <li>I was very pleased to get my hair dryer; it does a great job; I wish it had more settings.</li>
            <li>VERY SATISFIED.</li>
            <li>The height is just right when it is setting on a table, and she is very happy with it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very compact, has ideal temperature settings, easy to store and great to use!</li>
            <li>It creates a great volume of warm air that surrounds the head from top to bottom.  </li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s the best one available unless you want one that stands on a pedistal and occupies more storage space.</li>
            <li>I love this dryer!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I got it!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>but it works better than mine!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I took a chance on this!</li>
            <li>iI LOVE MY HAIR DRYER!  </li>
            <li>Love it!  </li>
            <li>LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>I read all the reviews first and determined that it would give me the best bang for my buck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>- WOULD RECOMMEND LOOKING FOR A BETTER DRYER!</li>
            <li>keep your ends healthy!</li>
            <li>i loved how easy it was to set up and use this dryer!</li>
            <li>The price was amazing.  </li>
            <li>It gives out great heat and so light weight.</li>
            <li>The power of this item, for it&#x27;s price and size, is amazing.</li>
            <li>Thanks for the prompt receipt and great customer service!</li>
            <li>But, the fact that this bonnet collapses, and still does an effective job of drying my hair</li>
            <li>I had to create my own &amp;#34;salon&amp;#34; at home.</li>
            <li>The Conaire HH400 folds up nicely for storage.</li>
            <li>Once I looked at the instruction, it fell into place quite nicely.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t say thrilled or overjoyed.</li>
            <li>Folds up nicely.</li>
            <li>it gets the job done, I&#x27;ve had it for three years without any mechanical problems, an iPod solves the noise issue, and honestly four hours at home doing my hair...for FREE..beats all day at the salon.</li>
            <li>This Conair HH400 has a nice design and it generates sufficient heat and air needed to activate my non-oxidant hair color.  </li>
            <li>Kind of disapppinting.</li>
            <li>this was a nice upgrade/ replacement.  </li>
            <li>Although it was probably effective, I&#x27;d gotten it for my octogenarian mother.  </li>
            <li>I had to get my own.  </li>
            <li>This bonnet is perfect, the storage is so much easier</li>
            <li>Not so thrilled that it&#x27;s now a $50 dryer.</li>
            <li>I guess I will have to send my nurse to get me a bonnet at the beauty supply place kind of inconvient</li>
            <li>My daughter was drying her hair, and I honestly thought I&#x27;d be deaf after she finished using it.</li>
            <li>but in the comfort of your own home</li>
            <li>Pricing is good and Amazon.com ships it free, so I am very satisfied with the purchase.  </li>
            <li>I had to settle for slightly higher than ideal.</li>
            <li>the size is great for the large size rollers and the two settings gives you good options</li>
            <li>This new one will be staying at my house, lol!</li>
            <li>I wanted a dryer that was compact, easy to store, do a good job drying my hair and this dryer does all that.</li>
            <li>The PRICE is great  and the SHIPPING was quick.</li>
            <li>works well easy to assemble and disassemble and good price</li>
            <li>Heat settings and air flow are good also easy to fold and store.</li>
            <li>Great price and quick shipping.</li>
            <li>The hair dryer is very easy to assemble and disassemble.  </li>
            <li>Collapses very easily.  </li>
            <li>This dryer is very easy to transport and store.</li>
            <li>But it doesn&#x27;t really do so very easily.</li>
            <li>Conair is offering a great product at a very reasonable price!</li>
            <li>My Mom is 96 years old and her hairdresser has started coming to the house to fix her hair and this dryer has worked wonderfully.  </li>
            <li>As far as drying your hair it does a great job!</li>
            <li>but I must be able to save some kind of money .So</li>
            <li>The two settings are great and it is a powerful dryer.  </li>
            <li>sure would be nice to get what I paided for</li>
            <li>but, my hair has never been better to be honest.</li>
            <li>that would make this hair dryer perfect .. butit gives good heat and seems to dry quicker than when im at the shop</li>
            <li>Construction of dryer isn&#x27;t nearly as good as the ones made 30 years ago, but this is true with all products.  </li>
            <li>It is also very cheaply made.  </li>
            <li>i gave it a 100% rating because it&#x27;s very comfortable</li>
            <li>and it is very light.  </li>
            <li>Very light weight</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so in love with this dryer, I could cry tears of joy  -- with the full confidence that this product could dry them up beautifully!  </li>
            <li>Love the power and heat of the item and it&#x27;s very light weight.</li>
            <li>Plus the fact that it folds up and fits in my bathroom closet is a huge plus!      </li>
            <li>The hood is huge!</li>
            <li>Therefore I chose the portable folding Conair Bonnet dryer and was almost completely pleased.</li>
            <li>I sure do like this dryer -</li>
            <li>I love this dryer.</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>And I love that i can fold the dryer up and store it under my bed</li>
            <li>cuz hey, its free shipping!</li>
            <li>but I absolutely love it</li>
            <li>I got the dryer in 2 days and was able to do my hair for a friend&#x27;s birthday party that night.  </li>
            <li>b - I&#x27;m glad I purchased it - I was on the edge to purchase a salon dryer for about $199</li>
            <li>I absolutely love the design of this dryer.</li>
            <li>Love the Conair collapsible bonnet hair dryer.  </li>
            <li>Next best thing to going to the hair dresser.</li>
            <li>and I am glad I bought it</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t really satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li>And while many people have commented about the stand itself, we have had no issues in setting this unit up.  </li>
            <li>I love this dryer</li>
            <li>If my hair was shorter this would be okay</li>
            <li>The product more than meets my expectations in performance.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m totally satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li>ok.</li>
            <li>As is-it&#x27;s just ok.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product three times and I am in love.</li>
            <li>and I use mostly the Jumbo sized rollers on my hair.</li>
            <li>To top it off, it&#x27;s flimsy.</li>
            <li>When I received the product, I was well pleased.  </li>
            <li>When I&#x27;m done there&#x27;s no frizz, love it.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>and most of all i love the price.</li>
            <li>Does it come with all the features your favorite dryer had..</li>
            <li>The air does blow from the top of the dryer.</li>
            <li>I am very proud to have owned this dryer, it has worked well for the last 12+ years</li>
            <li>I had no problem fitting it over my rollers.  </li>
            <li>I have used this type of dryer for many years, and like this one as well or better than any</li>
            <li>So I decided to purchase this, &amp;#34;I&#x27;m glad I did!&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li>Better for my curly hair than a blow dryer which even with a diffuser messes up my curls.</li>
            <li>The reason I gave it four stars is because its perfect for deep conditioning, tho</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an okay purchase</li>
            <li>But if you be patient, it gets warmer and the blower seems to get more forceful.</li>
            <li>I love this hair dryer.</li>
            <li>I love this hairdryer.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I purchased</li>
            <li>So does most vacuums and blow dryer.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I turn on my dryer to let it heat up, go wash my hair real quick, then get under.</li>
            <li>I love when boxes are waiting for me when I get home from work.</li>
            <li>Well, I am glad I didn&#x27;t miss out on this deal.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this hair dryer.</li>
            <li>and i love jow</li>
            <li>its ok not what I thought it would be.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m not always cooking the top.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not horribly noisy (IMO).</li>
            <li>never thought to purchase one online via amazon.com, glad I did.</li>
            <li>However, it has been a great product to use and I am happy with it for the money spent on it.</li>
            <li>for sure i will keep looking for more items here.</li>
            <li>Im not in love with it</li>
            <li>so I shall seer what more this thing has to offer.</li>
            <li>Because of compact design, all the holes blowing the air are on the top of the hood and there are none on the side.      </li>
            <li>I do like the design and judging by the way it dries the top of my head</li>
            <li>I love my hairdresser</li>
            <li>I am so glad I brought it.</li>
            <li>will be on the look out for more items from this seller.</li>
            <li>I rather enjoyed my dryer.</li>
            <li>Many adjustable heights.</li>
            <li>The 3 height positions need the hair dryer to be on top of either a table, a desk or something like to work.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t have got a better one then this</li>
            <li>Love it, and would recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li>and I could have bought something better.</li>
            <li>I tried blow drying with a diffuser, which does OK.  </li>
            <li>so I can wash my hair more often and forego the air drying.  </li>
            <li>I love how compact the design is as well for storage purposes.</li>
            <li>it  is ok does the job i realy cannot say much more about it.</li>
            <li>love it for the price</li>
            <li>I love this dryer.</li>
            <li>so it just bothers others around me :).</li>
            <li>I love and use it when putting my hair in curlers while trying to multi-task.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Wonderful home hair Dryer can&#x27;t say enough about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;W</li>
            <li>After reading some of the reviews, wasn&#x27;t sure</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I don&#x27;t use it with rollers.</li>
            <li>but I LOVE me some amazon</li>
            <li>I would recommended this ConairHH400 hair dryer for sure.</li>
            <li>BUILT CHEAPLY AND WOULD NOT RECOMMEND!  </li>
            <li>Did you expect to listen to the Bible on tape as you sat under it or be able to hear the tv?</li>
            <li>I love that it doesn&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s blowing out fire onto my head, burning my scalp and forehead</li>
            <li>ENJOY THIS PRODUCT!</li>
            <li>but it works ok.</li>
            <li>and I sure wouldn&#x27;t recommend buying it.</li>
            <li>But for the price, I am satisfied.</li>
            <li>We bought a standing version instead and it&#x27;s much better.</li>
            <li>You have to stick your head all the way to the top</li>
            <li>I fell in love with it.</li>
            <li>I can put this on the table while I work on my laptop, i can put it on a stool while I play my video games, and i am glad that i got it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you have short hair (say shoulder length and up) this is PERFECT.</li>
            <li>im ok,</li>
            <li>Great with fast drying time.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>but it seems to be OK now.</li>
            <li>love the way it folds up for storage.&lt;br /&gt;PeterB</li>
            <li>But it is a very powerful hair dryer and very easy to carry.</li>
            <li>Pretty good.</li>
            <li>This dryer is really hot and it works really good.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this order and felt that the product was well worth my money.</li>
            <li>and it is worth the buy!!</li>
            <li>and I love the easy store option.  </li>
            <li>I like the most that it is easy to store.  </li>
            <li>I love that it easily folds up and stores in my bathroom closet on the shelf.</li>
            <li>Love this dryer , very efficient  at a good price</li>
            <li>(sure it will cost more but it won&#x27;t break in 4 months of light use).  </li>
            <li>does a good job of drying my hair on large rollers.</li>
            <li>This dryer is ideal for the very short crop cuts.</li>
            <li>Works great, but loud</li>
            <li>have had it for 4 months and it seems to be becoming noisier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It works great, it&#x27;s just really loud &amp; has a ringing noise while running.</li>
            <li>Great product thus far.</li>
            <li>I would recemond this hair dryer to any one that wants a compact, good hair dryer..</li>
            <li>Dry&#x27;s hair without drying it out, light weight, works great!</li>
            <li>I did... fits perfect with big rollers, dries hair evenly and quick.</li>
            <li>The bonnet is a good size to fit large rollers</li>
            <li>But other than that it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li>Broke too easily.</li>
            <li>Its compact easy to store.  </li>
            <li>My wife loves this hair dryer compact, easy to store and use</li>
            <li>but it is well packed and can transport easy.</li>
            <li>It seems as if it could easily break.</li>
            <li>It collapses neatly and is easily stored.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s conveniently compact and easy to assemble.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s great for rollers if you have short hair.</li>
            <li>Easy to operate.  </li>
            <li>And to be honest, I am glad she has it now because this is much easier than me standing and curling her hair with a curling iron.  </li>
            <li>Also its easy to pack away.</li>
            <li>Opened easily.</li>
            <li>Easy to operate, easy to carry.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s height adjustable and easy to store.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s lightweight, portable and easy to assemble.  </li>
            <li>Folds easily and stores easy.</li>
            <li>Easy storage .</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to adjust according to your height, it drys all parts of your hair, and it easy to store away.  </li>
            <li>The materials seemed flimsy and easily breakable.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to move around.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s convenient and easy to set up.</li>
            <li>Bought it for a friend, it wasn&#x27;t as strong as she wanted, but others could use it.</li>
            <li>There should be more settings, as well as a cool setting.</li>
            <li>It works just fine.</li>
            <li>It is light weight and compact, easy to use</li>
            <li>It is slim and light and easy to carry.</li>
            <li>The replacement works fine.</li>
            <li>It works fine</li>
            <li>I got the dryer; it was working fine.</li>
            <li>, I think if I had rollers on or shorter hair this would be fine.  </li>
            <li>Bought a replacement whig worked out fine.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li>This one works fine.</li>
            <li>Which would have been fine for a $30 dryer.</li>
            <li>she has fine hair and hair get</li>
            <li>The dryer works fine &amp; the heat is descent.</li>
            <li>but if you don&#x27;t have nothing to do within your day then you&#x27;re fine.</li>
            <li>This one works fine.</li>
            <li>This dryer held up through it all, and dries your hair quickly in magnetic rollers, giving you a sleek, bouncy look!  </li>
            <li>The dryer gets very hot which I love because I don&#x27;t have to spend an eternity under it.</li>
            <li>Very powerful drying and easy to set up</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s comfortable and light  and easy to store.</li>
            <li>Even her hairdresser was impressed and when we told her how little it cost she was blown away.</li>
            <li>This has got to be the best little hair dryer I have ever seen for the non-professional hair stylist.  </li>
            <li>This product is compact and powerful, and is adjustable to quite a good height level; but if you have longer hair and need to sit under this with large (or maybe even medium) rollers this is NOT the dryer for you.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a hair dresser and this was extremely useful for my home projects :)</li>
            <li>style is important to my job, my image.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I did the free shipping option.  </li>
            <li>I am happy with it and would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li>This one would fit in a suitcase.</li>
            <li>This hair dryer is great for deep conditioning and coloring.</li>
            <li>Cheaply made and it shows when you try to use it</li>
            <li>Yes, it&#x27;s made mostly of cheap plastic, but what do you expect for this price?</li>
            <li>So we instead purchased smooth rollers and a hair dryer for her to sit under.  </li>
            <li>I was looking for a dryer to help with my deep conditioning process for my hair and im happy</li>
            <li>and I can sit under this comfortably.</li>
            <li>, IT DID NOT SHUT OFF AT ALL &amp; DRIED MY SET HAIR PERFECTLY..</li>
            <li>Is comfortable to use.</li>
            <li>It fit on a shelf in my bathroom.  </li>
            <li>You do have 2 find a comfortable way</li>
            <li>What is with making these things so cheap and flimsy?</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s well made and the price is fantastic.</li>
            <li>so I recieved free shipping.</li>
            <li>My wife truly enjoy the dryer.</li>
            <li>dryer does not only have two great heat settings</li>
            <li>I bought this hair dryer because it was the cheapest (with the highest star reviews for the price) and has the option for free shipping.  </li>
            <li>this dryer is fabulous.  </li>
            <li>This dryer was more than moneys worth.</li>
            <li>I use those big rolos (Dominican) and it dries them great.</li>
            <li>This is a cheap item.</li>
            <li>I like the size &amp; fit of this hair dryer.</li>
            <li>My 90 year old mother used it and loved it.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t mind shelling out more cash, you can find what you&#x27;re looking for pretty easily.</li>
            <li>This sits right on the kitchen table or any table top and extends to the height you need it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!!!!</li>
            <li>Absolutely!!!</li>
            <li>Very effective, even at the low setting.</li>
            <li>It is also very economical.</li>
            <li>The two heat settings are the perfect options -- I use the HIGH to get everything started and then switch to LOW to avoid overdrying.  </li>
            <li>Not too hot and very comfortable.</li>
            <li>Easy to use, easy to put away, nice hot air, dries my hair fast.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t ask for more, I am very pleased and I would definitely recommend to others.</li>
            <li>I loved that it collapses for easy storage and travel if necessary.</li>
            <li>Conair hair dryer is efficient, gets warm and does dry hair nicely.  </li>
            <li>Nice and compact and dries hair super fast and</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quiet, fits on any table &amp; the results are amazing!</li>
            <li>1875 watts was the highest dryer I could find and at first I wasn&#x27;t really sure about Conair.</li>
            <li>I purchased this dryer because my original one broke.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure this will die in about a year, maybe two.</li>
            <li>First of all, I absolutely love this product.  </li>
            <li>Well, However the Bonnet will not fully deploy without first raising the top adjuster fully.</li>
            <li>I ordered it and have used it a couple of times so far, and I absolutely love it!</li>
            <li>A great low budget find, but I am challenged every time I try to close this particular dryer down, LOL!!!  </li>
            <li>Your hair will be dried rather quickly and it will look great :)</li>
            <li>The best part about this dryer is that your hair looks fantastic after you use it to do a \\&quot;wet set\\&quot; with velcro (or probably any other kind) of rollers.  </li>
            <li>After trying full hood dryers, I returned to the one I have been using.  </li>
            <li>If I had to pay full price, I would have rated this a lot lower.</li>
            <li>I have been doing my own hair since my beautician retired unexpectedly.</li>
            <li>No problem of any kind so far.</li>
            <li>The unit is also has the feature where the bottom ring of the hair dryer bonnet (the part with the CONAIR logo) can be removed to provide a more gentle hair drying.  </li>
            <li>this dryer serves its purpose, I&#x27;ve used it twice,and I am pleased, It is fast</li>
            <li>This is good if you have short hair</li>
            <li>I roll only part of my hair, then grab a good book and sit and read til&#x27;</li>
            <li>That is true.  </li>
            <li>so thats good enough for me</li>
            <li>The bonnet has good heat,but only 2 settings.</li>
            <li>This product is ok for the price we paid, but it is very noisy.</li>
            <li>I was lucky enough to have a regular sized head, so it&#x27;s a perfect fit for me.</li>
            <li>this is a very powerful dryer and it is worth every penny</li>
            <li>Not crazy about how the cord winds up - gets in the way, but dryer works great - runs 30 minutes a night to dry kids hair before bed.</li>
            <li>those that are very concerned about making this purchase, the hair dryer has some very unique advantages.  </li>
            <li>As someone said in another review, it mostly heats at the top, but overall, for what you spend, its what you get.  </li>
            <li>The salon dryer also has a &#x27;blow torch&#x27; setting which can quickly take care of all hair types.</li>
            <li>Dries my hair quickly.</li>
            <li>Love being able to sit under hooded dryer to deep condition.</li>
            <li>Broke way too quick, The bonnet part won&#x27;t stay up anymore.</li>
            <li>This one dries my hair quickly and it is not too hot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It was delivered so quickly after I purchased it that I could not believe it.  </li>
            <li>I quickly unpacked it and tried out</li>
            <li>but luckily the dryer has proved me</li>
            <li>I love that it collapses for better storage and there are several height adjustments.</li>
            <li>That smell quickly went away after about 3 minutes of having it on.</li>
            <li>This dryer came fairly quickly</li>
            <li>I can fit a head full of curlers under it and the hi heat is pretty</li>
            <li>If you need one, it is adequate.</li>
            <li>Easy to set up and easy to take down, heated nice and evenly.    </li>
            <li>The fact that it is converts in a flat box like thing is great because it does not require much space.</li>
            <li>it does exactly what I needed it to do, it&#x27;s compact and light weight.</li>
            <li>Good , gives you good heat that covers all your head, when I saw the negative reviews I was worried but I really like lit</li>
            <li>If I could get it to fold down the way it was supposed to, it would be great.</li>
            <li>if you wear your hair very short because most of the heat blow right on top of your head.</li>
            <li>This is a great dryer with low and high settings.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used a hooded dryer (at home) in many years and didn&#x27;t know what to expect from the new models.</li>
            <li>the hair dryer was exactly what i expected, it was a great size and puts out alot of heat.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s portable, easy to use, convenient, and very affordable.</li>
            <li>It works very well, is easily stored and doesn&#x27;t bother her to use as the  salon dryer does.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use and folds up compactly so it doesn&#x27;t take too much storage space.</li>
            <li>dryer is easy to set up, and heats very well.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to use and dries fast.</li>
            <li>Very convenient and easy to store.</li>
            <li>It drys my hair fast and It is easy to pack away when finished.</li>
            <li>She has long, thick hair and finds this kind of dryer works best for her hair.</li>
            <li>It only dries the top of your head!</li>
            <li>When placed on a sturdy surface such as my dinner table with a chair in front (which is how I use mine), I found the height to be perfect and the ability to adjust a little higher should accommodate most.</li>
            <li>It DOES have holes on the side, and was the right temp on high, not too hot but warm hot.  </li>
            <li>Im loving my new dryer although its not as big as it looks on the top part.</li>
            <li>&quot; said it was probably a manufacturer&#x27;s defect and didn&#x27;t sound like it was at all unusual.  </li>
            <li>it comfortably fits my whole head.</li>
            <li>It is light weight and really dries the hair.</li>
            <li>I got it on sale (it was about $28), so it was worth the value.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s comfortable, not too loud, and gives good heat even on the low setting.  </li>
            <li>The dryer is powerful.   </li>
            <li>makes this purchase well worth it.    </li>
            <li>This dryer is able to fit a big roller set underneath as well.</li>
            <li>So far, I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
            <li>hair dryer is quite powerful.  </li>
            <li>And again, the unit is quite powerful.  </li>
            <li>Would have liked it have different heat levels.</li>
            <li>This is a nice dryer to have IF you have short hair</li>
            <li>I think you will fully get your money&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li>This is a nice hair Dyer the only thing I do not like about</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m satisfied so far with it.......</li>
            <li>features are even better than my old one</li>
            <li>everything about this product is worth the price</li>
            <li>I am not crazy about the cord storage area.  </li>
            <li>One use in, and I am pleased with the product thus far.</li>
            <li>This really helped my hair look better than air-drying, and it was really inexpensive.</li>
            <li>so it was worth it for that price</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad my old one stopped working.</li>
            <li>This hair dryer replaced my old one of five years or more.</li>
            <li>Not a heavy duty unit but great for occasional use</li>
            <li>Well worth the money.</li>
            <li>But be careful, the bonnett tends to not latch good and will fall on your head.</li>
            <li>It is a pain to set up and use, it is not even worth it.  </li>
            <li>It is just like the regular dryers at the salon but more comfortable because you&#x27;re at home.</li>
            <li>Worth the money</li>
            <li>And it folds down really nicely, and could even be tucked up under your bed!</li>
            <li>I could assemble it and disassemble it pretty easy, but it was too much for her.  </li>
            <li>I love to wrap my hair and seat under the dryer my hair dry&#x27;s quickly and it good for doing deep conditioning</li>
            <li>It stores nicely and is easy to put up and down.</li>
            <li>Gets hot quickly.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t get super hot like salon</li>
            <li>Gets hot and dries hair quickly.</li>
            <li>and it dries my hair pretty quick.</li>
            <li>I am sitting under it right now.  </li>
            <li>Shipping was right on time.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t see right now anything I would not like of this product.</li>
            <li>right watt</li>
            <li>If you have short/medium length hair like mine, it might just be right for you.</li>
            <li>There is a huge gap because the 2 side of the bonnet do not lock together; therefore, much of the hot hair escape.</li>
            <li>Best $20 I&#x27;ve spent in a long time.</li>
            <li>If you have a sensitive scalp and most dryers are too hot for you, give this one a try.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not that good for long hair and it uses too much space.&lt;br</li>
            <li>the bonnet has an extension that flips down and makes a great cover for the rolled hair and dries it so fast.  </li>
            <li>Also, instead of having to stand there with a blow dryer and diffuser, you now can sit comfortably in a chair and surf the Internet while your hair is drying, so I&#x27;d highly recommend this for multi-taskers.  </li>
            <li>Finally, it is quite light weight and can easily be carried about from place to place.</li>
            <li>It has only two settings but they are more than adequate for drying the hair.  </li>
            <li>Through my college years, I really enjoyed the way it folds somewhat flat, for easy loading when moving; it doesn&#x27;t take up much space.  </li>
            <li>Given that this dryer only cost about $35 to purchase and I got free shipping through Amazon Prime, this didn&#x27;t seem like a good use of my time and money, especially since I strongly expect the replacement item to be just as cheaply made and just as likely to break o.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I noticed a distinct odor blowing at first</li>
            <li>The top gets very, very hot and the distribution of heat throughout the entire hood is uneven.&lt;br /&gt;2.  </li>
            <li>Hair drys quick, and it&#x27;s a nice consistent blow with a high and low setting.</li>
            <li>New product was in fabulous condition.</li>
            <li>I found the product to be convenient, the price is right and it fits exactly up under my bed.</li>
            <li>and you dont feel like your head has a large helmet on it!.....</li>
            <li>It heats up fast and drys your hair quickly.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this once to deep condition my hair and all i can say is so far, so good.</li>
            <li>It accomodates my large rollers and dries pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t take too much space and has very hot air.</li>
            <li>, it dries my hair very fast and it is so convenient to store and travel with.</li>
            <li>I have natural wavy fine hair.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m use to a lot better hair dryers for about the same price.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a dryer that would be adequately hot.</li>
            <li>I love it, and will definitely recommend it to my friends.</li>
            <li>Overall, we&#x27;re quite pleased with this purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Hood is not too deep so top of my head was overdried while ends were still damp.</li>
            <li>, it can get a bit hot on the forehead and eyes so try and use a cover.</li>
            <li>, it can get a bit hot on the forehead and eyes so try and use a cover.</li>
            <li>This hair dryer does what I need it to do, but I think the loud sound it makes when running is damaging to my hearing.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it, my ears were ringing for hours afterward.</li>
            <li>When you try to extend it to be higher, it tends to collapse.  </li>
            <li>Is it as hot as a salon..</li>
            <li>, I have curly fine hair and it dries it in no less than 45 minutes.</li>
            <li>but there&#x27;s isn&#x27;t really a good air flow to the sides, and tilting my head in different angles every 15 mins gets old fast.</li>
            <li>However, the blow-holes are only at the top and there are none on the sides.</li>
            <li>The first unit delivered was defective.</li>
            <li>It took a minute to figure out how the hood works, but once I got it running, it worked pretty well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s having to use a fan and convert room temp air into hot air.</li>
            <li>There are only holes in the top of the dryer, but there is a piece that completes the dome and directs heat around the rest of your head.</li>
            <li>- Gets pretty hot.</li>
            <li>Heats pretty quickly.&lt;br</li>
            <li>First of all, the unit is tippy.</li>
            <li>However, it is very noisy!</li>
            <li>:) ive only used it once</li>
            <li>it is exactly what she wanted.  </li>
            <li>This Dryer does get just as hot as one might hope..</li>
            <li>It gives out hot air to set my curls.</li>
            <li>this is the first hair dryer I&#x27;ve ever purchased online.</li>
            <li>I will opt for a better shape next time.     </li>
            <li>Now the neighbor comes over to use it and now I have two HOT HEADED women in the house.</li>
            <li>This unit is so well designed and packs away so well for transport or storage, I find it truly refreshing to buy such a well engineered product.  </li>
            <li>so i guess i wanted it more for deep condtion</li>
            <li>and it did have a funny smell at first</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad to finally have one and for a reasonable price!</li>
            <li>but i don&#x27;t like that the vent holes are only on top.</li>
            <li>No matter what I do, the hairdo doesn&#x27;t last more than a day.</li>
            <li>But glad Amazon took it back w/o any hassle.</li>
            <li>it can stretch out pretty tall.  </li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t need it that hot anyway.</li>
            <li>Makes my life so much easier with three daughters!</li>
            <li>I only use low setting because it gets pretty warm!</li>
            <li>it does work the dryer gets really hot</li>
            <li>First off this is the loudest dryer I&#x27;ve ever encountered.</li>
            <li>hi - unfortunately it is not compatible with our power source and will need a convertor-stepdown transformer for it to work -which</li>
            <li>/&gt;This may be a downside for some, the holes from which the air comes are only on the top, not the sides.</li>
            <li>Otherwise it works pretty well.</li>
            <li>Low power is much better.</li>
            <li>and I would then put on hot rollers).</li>
            <li>The heat is evenly distributed and it is not overly hot in my opinion.</li>
            <li>No complaints, very sturdy, worth the money.  </li>
            <li>I use it pretty often during my wash days now.</li>
            <li>Others who had a previous dryer they loved, or who really want to reproduce salon results may want to go with a higher end dryer.</li>
            <li>I find that setting the dryer on a average height dining room table (don&#x27;t have the tall kind) or a computer desk allows for the right height to sit underneath with a dining or office chair.</li>
            <li>DO NOT ATTEMPT TO USE PROUCT TO DRY TEARS OF JOY; USE A FACIAL TISSUE AND SEE YOUR PSYCHIATRIST.</li>
            <li>this is a great hair dryer for the price, my hair is short and my hair is dry within 20 to 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Directions are easily followed.&lt;br /&gt;Drying time is much quicker than our old one.  </li>
            <li>It is very compact and delivers just the right amount of heat.</li>
            <li>Very pleased with it light weight but only has 2 speeds high and low.  </li>
            <li>But other than it&#x27;s really nice because it&#x27;s a space saver</li>
            <li>HOWEVER, the vents are only in the top of the dryer, so it feels like it is burning the top of your head, but doesn&#x27;t dry the sides and bottom portion of hair.</li>
            <li>It is an OK dryer, but must put it on high for a quick dry.</li>
            <li>Also, the sound is very loud at the high setting.</li>
            <li>It gets plenty hot and very versitile.</li>
            <li>This hairdryer is a bit weaker (not as hot and not as much power) as my hand held, but I like that</li>
            <li>It is very loud (especially on high) and the neck could be a tad longer.</li>
            <li>It dries hair pretty fast, but the noise deafening.  </li>
            <li>The only thing about it that makes it unlike a salon dryer is that you have to kind of move your head around for a few minutes before you finish to make sure each part dries evenly.</li>
            <li>For the price, it does a good job if you are willing to move your head around to get the back of your hair dry.  </li>
            <li>a bit *too* high and low setting is more like medium.</li>
            <li>So, i have to stay under the dryer longer to make sure that the hair in rollers at the bottom also get dry.  </li>
            <li>this model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The dryer is very compact, about the size of a shoebox that a pair of boots come in, and it gets hot fast and dries your hair</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so easy to fold back up and store this dryer as well, which keeps it out of the way when I am not using it.</li>
            <li>I took my chances on buying the dryer even though the reviews were less than kind to the product.</li>
            <li>Most of the time I air dry my hair.  </li>
            <li>It is compact enough to store easily.  </li>
            <li>I still just wiped it down for own peace of mind, but I really did not have to.</li>
            <li>I use large to jumbo size rollers and it fits well under the width of the dryer bonnet.  </li>
            <li>As far as the circumference of the bonnet - I think I have a fairly large head (like Elaine from Seinfeld - haha!), especially with velcro rollers in, and I have no problem fitting my head under the bonnet.  </li>
            <li>Liked this dryer, only problem is low setting is too hot, otherwise I would give it five stars.  </li>
            <li>While it does the top of my head nicely, the bottom half stays wet, even after 45 minutes.</li>
            <li>Only the top portion of my head fit underneath so the majority of my hair would not get dry if I were to use this dryer.  </li>
            <li>I have fine hair, and bend my neck to reach the back and then move my head side to side.  </li>
            <li>Its condition is good, and very helpful when I use it daily to dry my hair .  </li>
            <li>On top of it all, the product was very cleverly designed in that it collapses into a small carry-on (a bit smaller than the size on your grocery store baskets) which makes it very easy to store.   </li>
            <li>I really try to avoid heat but to deep conditioner I figure this is fine.</li>
            <li>It collapses flat for easy storage and travel (via car).  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyway, as a few others stated, the bonnet doesnt line up for a secure snap on fit.</li>
            <li>It saves me time and money, which I really appreciate.</li>
            <li>I feel the air drying my whole head.  </li>
            <li>Cheaply made but does put out enough heat and air.</li>
            <li>Doubt if it will get much use.</li>
            <li>I really like this dryer.</li>
            <li>I hear about this dryer so much from people who have used it over the years and it does the job.  </li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t to put too much heat on your hair</li>
            <li>Its very portable.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Finally, the transaction went very well.  </li>
            <li>The delivery time fast.  </li>
            <li>I really like this product</li>
            <li>All this, coupled with the free shipping (qualified for order above $25 free shipping) and on time delivery, I would definitely recommend this item to a friend!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;March 22nd 2017:</li>
            <li>It is also adjustable and it wide so you can sit comfortably under it with rollers!</li>
            <li>it shipped fast and it was a reasonable price</li>
            <li>One Blue plastic knob on side of bonnet broke after light use but beyond the 30 day amazon return window.  </li>
            <li>I will write a follow up review letting everyone know how the replacement item holds up (not expecting much).ement item holds up (not expecting much).</li>
            <li>Its a $30 dryer, so how much can you expect.</li>
            <li>The dryer works very well for me.</li>
            <li>Purchased this for my aunt, and she really likes it.  </li>
            <li>Dries my hair fast - but hood needs to be deeper.  </li>
            <li>Works very well...lots of power.  </li>
            <li>Dries fast.  </li>
            <li>It works really well</li>
            <li>The dryer heats very well</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon.</li>
            <li>and my hair is ready to go.  </li>
            <li>I have had my dryer for a whole now.</li>
            <li>and I really wanted this type of dryer</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t recommend it at all.</li>
            <li>It dries my hair fast, fyi</li>
            <li>I will be ordering another one just in case this one blows out as much as i use it.</li>
            <li>Not used very often</li>
            <li>It works very well</li>
            <li>thanks Michelle</li>
            <li>I dont really have a place I can put this.  </li>
            <li>It really evenly distributes the heat onto your whole head unless you have a dino megahead.</li>
            <li>but this is very roomy and spacious.</li>
            <li>I have very curly hair</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s no way around it, really.</li>
            <li>fact that big rollers don&#x27;t quite fit.</li>
            <li>I put on coconut oil (or almond oil...or grape seed oil, depends on my mood haha)</li>
            <li>Your hair really absorbs the product so</li>
            <li>This dryer works very well</li>
            <li>That said, I consider $30ish to be a reasonable annual purchase</li>
            <li>It dries the hair with rollers very well.</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>I actually felt it was better than the salon dryers because when i put in my pearl bud ear phones, the noise was cut off almost completely</li>
            <li>It has at least three (probably more like five) distinct levels at which a person can position it which I think is good enough for a portable collapsible standing dryer such as this one.</li>
            <li>This dryer would work well if you have a perfect table behind your chair and don&#x27;t have a lot of hair at the back of your neck.</li>
            <li>(I havent had issues with it folding back, but I wouldve liked the extra measure to ensure it wouldnt).</li>
            <li>On low, the sound of the dryer is bearable, but the entire dryer doesn&#x27;t get warm enough to really get the heat going.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Nice hair dryer that I only use when I deep conditioner my daughter and my hair.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t find it particularly noisy and since I have fairly short hair, it all dries easily by just tilting my head a bit from side to side or forward during the 5 minutes</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like that the little air vents are just right at the top of the dryer.</li>
            <li>It just blew hot hair, didn&#x27;t really provide a smooth, heated dry, which is what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>For starters it&#x27;s LOUD!!!</li>
            <li>WASN&#x27;T SATISFIED WITH MY OTHER ONE.  </li>
            <li>It might be too hot for really delicate hair but overall works great for the price.</li>
            <li>i love it even thou other</li>
            <li>I have spent a lot more on dryers trying to find a replacement for my Lady Schick that I received as a high school graduation gift in 1976 (held together with duct tape and bungee cords), and this dryer comes closest in power and drying capacity.</li>
            <li>This product folds and stores nicely and is the right size for jumbo curlers, heats evenly and high heat dries my thick hair under 25 minutes.</li>
            <li>I have older bonnet style models that are much quieter.</li>
            <li>The dryer gets it dry, very quickly she says.</li>
            <li>Love that it folds down to a reasonable height.</li>
            <li>It was just the right temperature on high--not too hot that my ears burned, and not too low that I didn&#x27;t feel any heat.  </li>
            <li>The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because the side knobs came off easily and one completely broke off</li>
            <li>I was looking for a bonnet dryer for a while, hoping it would free me up to multi-task while my velcro rollers set my long hair.  </li>
            <li>I would say the average woman with shoulder length hair will be satisfied with this dryer.</li>
            <li>The dryer heats hot like a professional hair dryer.  </li>
            <li>Kind of awkward to close but overall a good hairdryer.</li>
            <li>Will use for five to ten minutes, let it cool off then start again.</li>
            <li>Yes it&#x27;s true, it doesn&#x27;t cover the very back of your head (by your neck)</li>
            <li>As others have said, while I used to dread the time wasted while drying my hair with a normal hair dryer, now I can get out of bed, jump in the shower, and then spend the time while my hair is drying catching up on everything on my phone that I would normally have before getting out of bed.  </li>
            <li>I love that you can have the hood up or down.</li>
            <li>I would imagine the high setting would be as hot if not hotter than the professional dryers in the salon.</li>
            <li>I also LOVE the fact that this dryer folds up, I can store it underneath my guest bed with a typical metal frame.</li>
            <li>This is fabulous, as I paid triple the price for another hooded dryer that took 1 and 1/2 hours to dry my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>(my main reason for choosing this product)  </li>
            <li>For the price it is a decent dryer-just be prepared for uneveness of drying on head of hair.</li>
            <li>This is a decent dryer.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this particular dryer to anyone.</li>
            <li>This particular one required muscles of steel to try to yank it upward.</li>
            <li>Id suggest to turn the hooded dryer on low for 30min for the first run just to get rid of the hot plastic smell, before using it.</li>
            <li>Not that noisy, heats quickly, the size of the hood is big.</li>
            <li>I was a little weary at first knowing that heat only comes from the top and not the sides, but if you let the dryer heat up for about 15 prior to use, it will work just fine.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m amazed that this reasonably priced, relatively lightweight dryer has the look, feel and function of something right out of a salon.  </li>
            <li>sure is better than a normal blow dryer because you do not have to keep holding it, but next time I&#x27;ll get the real thing, that stands on its on and actually dries all of the hair without you having to lower your head to dry it at the back.</li>
            <li>The high setting is</li>
            <li>I just can imagine what the high would feel like.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend the Conair HH400 Hair Dryer.</li>
            <li>Product works, but highly recommend ear protection.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I would recommend it highly.</li>
            <li>Some of the reviews gave it high marks which I cannot understand.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>And this was on high speed and high heat.</li>
            <li>Heats up fast, easy to set up and take down.</li>
            <li>This hair dryer does a good job at getting your entire head dry in a short time.  </li>
            <li>Get another model, spend a little more money</li>
            <li>The sides and very back of my hair dry last while the top of my head gets pretty hot.</li>
            <li>I can live with that, most dryers will not dry long curly hair.</li>
            <li>Kind of hard to maneuver.</li>
            <li>Works pretty good but, because of all the weight on the front, makes the neck very weak.</li>
            <li>This model is flimsy and sounds very high pitched compared to my old model.</li>
            <li>As soon as we reached the top steps to her house, the bottom portion fell out and ROLLED DOWN THE STAIRS!</li>
            <li>It did the job very well although as some users say it is a bit loud.</li>
            <li>Works really well for setting my 84 yr old Mom&#x27;s hair, (</li>
            <li>I really like this product so far.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great idea gone wrong</li>
            <li>I was able to do a flexi rod set and it dried my hair in about 50 - 55 minutes.</li>
            <li>The noise was not even as loud as the regular salon dryers or at most the same.</li>
            <li>A knob on the hood broke off within 1 week under normal use.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s normal or not.</li>
            <li>but I normally listen music or watch a movie while I&#x27;m drying my hair</li>
            <li>it is very loud on the high fan speed/heat setting, 2.)</li>
            <li>If I am able to use two outlets at the same time, I can use both dryers to get completely dry in the 10-15 minutes.</li>
            <li>I love this hair dryer because it can actually dry a short woman&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li>It would have been a 5 star had the shape been more of a cube to dry the back.</li>
            <li>It only dry the top of head.</li>
            <li>The low setting for heat is just right.  </li>
            <li>actually using it right now as I write this review.</li>
            <li>It does not dry as well or get as hot, but does get the job done, eventually.</li>
            <li>As others stated it is roomy enough for very large rollers.</li>
            <li>It was easy to set up and put down to store under my bed.</li>
            <li>it is so easy to set up and take down and store.  </li>
            <li>On the other hand it is stores compactly and is huge.</li>
            <li>Brand new out the box.  </li>
            <li>but it is because its new so its burnig it out</li>
            <li>it is good for when you need to use those hard rollers for the different look that you need, it feels like the ones at the salon.</li>
            <li>Amazon was happy to take back the broken item (they paid for shipping) and immediately shipped out a new</li>
            <li>Ok on my short hair but does not dry lower back of hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely no where near salon quality and not always worth the hassle of pulling it out to use it.</li>
            <li>The instructions helped but I didn&#x27;t think they were very clear.  </li>
            <li>The Conair heats up but is very loud.  </li>
            <li>Bought this for my grandmother who had a very old school version of this</li>
            <li>but it very loud.</li>
            <li>But be warned this dryer is extremely loud and high pitched.  </li>
            <li>Both high and low fan speeds are hot, there is no cool setting available.</li>
            <li>Also, this dryer is sooooo loud!</li>
            <li>As for the arm, I was pleasantly surprised by the adjustments!</li>
            <li>The only issue i had was when I set it up the first time.</li>
            <li>, you will not be able to have it drape past your shoulder.</li>
            <li>I used it on the low setting, and it got really hot.</li>
            <li>Also it is pretty quiet.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never owned one before but it seems like it gets hot enough like the salon dryers.</li>
            <li>I didnt purchase this item from Amazon, but the one I have is the exact same hooded dryer.</li>
            <li>The dryer dries my entire head and doesn&#x27;t get too hot to the point that it would burn.</li>
            <li>old style curlers and the works!)  </li>
            <li>The only thing I didn&#x27;t like about it was that when I first turned it on, there was a burning-like odor that emitted from it.</li>
            <li>However, this dryer is LOUD!  </li>
            <li>Not worth buying cant get the flip to fit correctly so it has a gap in it.</li>
            <li>The heat is strong enough to dry the hair on rollers at the neckline, even though the dryer does not cover the lower part of the head.    </li>
            <li>If you have long hair or just enjoy using larger rollers for a fuller look, please select another dryer.</li>
            <li>It does not dry as fast</li>
            <li>and I like to do frequent deep conditioners and hot oils.</li>
            <li>I bought this new conair HH400 for replacement old conair HH400, this is a good product, but you should be very gentle when you close the cover, I broke hooks when I closed a little harder</li>
            <li>It only covers down to about the top of your ears.</li>
            <li>The old one quit working, so we looked for a new one which resembled the old one.</li>
            <li>Also, the dryer only has heat coming from the top of the bonnet and not the sides and bottom half.</li>
            <li>It is big, easy to put together and not much noisier than any salon types.</li>
            <li>The one thing I don&#x27;t like about this dryer is the holes because they are only located in the top half of the hood.</li>
            <li>I have locs so getting them all dry, especially in the winter, is important.</li>
            <li>Wish someone would design a hard hat bonnet style dryer that collapses but drys the entire head, not just the top!</li>
            <li>To clarify even further it only has that smell the very FIRST time its used.</li>
            <li>As for it drying only on the top of your head, that&#x27;s not true.</li>
            <li>the dryer gets hot enough so that it isn&#x27;t really an issue if you wrap your hair and sit all the way under the dryer.&lt;br /&gt;Burnt Smell - I noticed the slight burnt smell when first turning on the dryer.</li>
            <li>awsome for my new short cut dries in 30 min folds down to almost nothing great if you have small storage space</li>
            <li>I have never had a hair dryer this loud.</li>
            <li>Really loud.</li>
            <li>Next, the airflow on this dryer leaves much to be desired.</li>
            <li>I use this dryer for my naturally curly hair, after I use my Ouidad products (which takes me about 20-30min)</li>
            <li>Being naturally curly, I will also say that this dryer is safer than using a diffuser to prevent fly-aways and frizzing.</li>
            <li>but that could be because i was turning my head alot to tend to my 1 year old</li>
            <li>and I was pleasantly surprised</li>
            <li>And oh, yeah, you may want to throw in some old issues of PEOPLE and COSMO . . .</li>
            <li>The reason I bought this is that I have naturally curly hair that tends to frizz if I don&#x27;t get a professional blow-dry; on a whim, I had my stylist gel me up and stick me under the dryer and was amazed at how I ended up with even curls and no frizz.  </li>
            <li>There is no forgiveness in the hood height and no air circulating near your nape.</li>
            <li>and so far so good!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and i had no trouble drying my hair.</li>
            <li>This dryer meets my natural 4B hair needs.  </li>
            <li>I had an old hooded type and it was lost in a fire.</li>
            <li>The fold-away feature is a life saver for those with young children and for space proposes</li>
            <li>I bought this for my naturally curly hair as a way to beat my curly hair frizz.</li>
            <li>It is loud but it&#x27;s not unbearable</li>
            <li>I purchased this dryer for me and my two young daughters ( I do their hair myself).</li>
            <li>If you are a natural hair girl, then you will understand where I am coming from.  </li>
            <li>Professional results.</li>
            <li>just said it gets a lot hotter than her old one...</li>
            <li>and I cant hear the TV, its that loud.  </li>
            <li>I am naturally curly so on days when I don&#x27;t want to &amp;#34;wash-n-go&amp;#34; I use this or a handheld with diffuser.</li>
            <li>My Mom is 90 and her old bonnet dryer didn&#x27;t work</li>
            <li>I seems to me as though the entire unit itself is very flimsily made.</li>
            <li>I since my  lupus is in my joints so it is not heavy on my hand.</li>
            <li>After contorting myself to get as much of my hair inside the hood as possible</li>
            <li>However, it is not as loud if you are the person under it.</li>
            <li>The bottom &amp;#34;band&amp;#34; part of the dryer that flips around when you set it up doesn&#x27;t have any holes for air to reach the bottom of your hair near your neck.</li>
            <li>its also kinda loud.</li>
            <li>and I get professional results every time I use it.</li>
            <li>plus these dryer is extremely LOUD</li>
            <li>it is worth the price (~$37) and gets the job done with minimal discomfort.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m tired of wasting my money on a company that won&#x27;t stand by its own products and doesn&#x27;t act surprised when they break.  </li>
            <li>I mainly wanted a hooded dryer for deep conditioning my natural hair (3c/4a), but large enough to accommadate rollers if I chose to utilize it for drying.</li>
            <li>The dryer is &#x27;hot enough&#x27; to dry my hair in a reasonable amount of time.</li>
            <li>So sit under it for about 10 minutes, read a book and let it dry the top rollers and then the heat will work its way down to the lower part of your head.</li>
            <li>Sometimes it has a gap in the back because of how dryer folds down to close, but it&#x27;s an easy fix.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been able to work around this by a. moving my head (of course) and lowering the hood and holding my head down to dry the back.&lt;br</li>
            <li>its lightweight, folds up to a small package and can be stored easily  </li>
            <li>This dryer does exactly what it is supposed to do, which is to dry your hair.</li>
            <li>Too much heat on your hair is not a good thing though, so I think the dryer&#x27;s heat settings are fine as is.</li>
            <li>I was looking for something that would dry my hair quickly and this definitely does the job.</li>
            <li>It wouldn&#x27;t budge, then, reluctantly, edged up a little, then, pull, a little more, and, pull, a little more.</li>
            <li>This dryer is only deep enough to dry the top of your hair.  </li>
            <li>Naturally, the salon dryer is huge and extends down a lot further.</li>
            <li>but you get used to it and it has just two settings (High or Low).</li>
            <li>It comes in low and high settings.</li>
            <li>Low and high setting.</li>
            <li>Dries hair in 25 minutes on low no need to use high setting.  </li>
            <li>so air can reach the rest of your hair; but then all you can see is the inside of the dryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dryer has two heat settings-low and high, no timer, no as noisy as other hood dryers and a very adjustable height.</li>
            <li>My hair is about shoulder length and the dryer gets most of if, but the part past my chin doesn&#x27;t get as much air so doesn&#x27;t dry at the same rate os the rest of my hair.      </li>
            <li>Will be too small for huge rollers.</li>
            <li>I can never get the whole cord inside and it takes to long to accomplish the amount I do get inside.</li>
            <li>love how this dryer collapses flat and can be stored under the bed or easily in a small closet.  </li>
            <li>There doesn&#x27;t seem to be enough air circulating around to dry the hair appropriately, so even though my hair is short, it takes forever to dry.</li>
            <li>RIght now I am deep conditioning my hair under the dryer for 30 minutes, then I&#x27;ll dry it for 45m to an hour</li>
            <li>However, I couple negatives of this product are: it is not deep enough if you use large rollers.  </li>
            <li>The bonnet is also definitely big enough to use with my large rollers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>You will literally have to turn your head several different ways just to get a full dry.</li>
            <li>but I am definitely looking into purchasing a new one</li>
            <li>I purchased this dryer in July 2012 and now, three months later, I have to purchase a new dryer.  </li>
            <li>it did get my whole head dry</li>
            <li>It seems to dry at a fast rate.</li>
            <li>dry fast</li>
            <li>Great for me because it takes soooo long to dry my thick long hair with a hand held blow dryer.</li>
            <li>Works very well on my relaxed African American shoulder length hair.</li>
            <li>It is like a constant shrill scream, soccer match whistle kind of noise.</li>
            <li>I hate that people think they should only have to pay like $5 to get the perfect machine.</li>
            <li>The heat is even and hot enough to dry my medium length hair, without burning my hair or scalp.  </li>
            <li>its very loud sounds like a vacuum</li>
            <li>Aside from the hood being too short, the dryer being too loud and the limited heat settings (high and low),this dryer has been overheating and the plug is almost completely melted.</li>
            <li>I live in a small NYC apartment and love that it folds down for storage.  </li>
            <li>The bonnet doesn&#x27;t come down far enough to reach the nape area of my head without the roof of the bonnet touching the top of my head, so that was disappointing.</li>
            <li>All in all I am happy with my purchase so long as itll last at least a year and a half</li>
            <li>The other reviews about not drying the sides and back is right on target</li>
            <li>It has two heat settings: I use the LOW for deep conditioning, and the HIGH for drying the hair after shampoos.</li>
            <li>I wish I would&#x27;ve spent a little more money and bought a different dryer.</li>
            <li>I tried the large hard hood dryers but the air holes were only in the top half.  </li>
            <li>After being unsuccessful at taming my very frizzy hair (I am african american) with regular hair dryers, I thought that maybe a bonnet hair dryer would be the solution to help me achieve salon result (frizz-free hair) at home.</li>
            <li>I only used this dryer once so far.</li>
            <li>you can barely hear your surroundings.</li>
            <li>Even hand-held blow dryers are loud.</li>
            <li>I would say the watts are normal, my hair dried in a reasonable amount of time.</li>
            <li>Works well, a bit awkward, but considering the task it has to perform a good buy for the price.  </li>
            <li>Although it doesn&#x27;t dry the back very well.</li>
            <li>Just be careful w/ the way you handle it, it seems a little flimsy but it dryes my hair just fine.</li>
            <li>I dont know what the other reviews are talking about but the back of my head did get hot.</li>
            <li>few reviews complained about the back and sides of their hair not drying as fast as the top.</li>
            <li>Never adept at styling my short, fine hair with a blow dryer, I needed to use a curling iron as well.</li>
            <li>But other than that I would prefer a straight forward table dryer.</li>
            <li>than any other one that I have found, and it is very sturdy</li>
            <li>The dryer head is a little top heavy but workable.</li>
            <li>and I could hear the program I was watching on my laptop clearly without increasing the volume higher than usual.</li>
            <li>As such I do have to move my head around a bit to distribute the heat/air evenly, but it is much less work than my old hand dryer and dries much faster.  </li>
            <li>It is more difficult than her old Gold-N-Hot</li>
            <li>I am a natural African-American woman and I have been looking for a dryer for the sole purpose of deep conditioning my hair.</li>
            <li>I do not dry my hair with curlers in it, but the interior of this dryer seems plenty spacious to me.</li>
            <li>The only thing I found funny is that it looks like a dryer once it is let out, but once it is let down it looks like a space ship.</li>
            <li>maybe a little to hot on the hottest setting for some.</li>
            <li>I can tell when it&#x27;s going to happen now because it starts to smell a little bit funny</li>
            <li>Major complaints by OTHER reviewers include noisy/loud; bonnet too small for large rollers/big head; heating part located at the top so sides don&#x27;t get dried and sometimes, the arm not long enough.</li>
            <li>I havent used it with rollers yet, but I believe it is spacious enough to fit at least medium sized rollers (I have a big head).</li>
            <li>I ordered it because I have to use a dryer like this for my hair (I use very big rollers due to very curly hair...</li>
            <li>Apparently this item was a product from 2007 that amazon had in stock and sold to me; Conair wanted me to prove it was actually purchased in 2013.  </li>
            <li>And it is not a long hair dryer, maybe medium length to shorter.</li>
            <li>These are becoming extinct.</li>
            <li>I was very skeptical when I purchased the dryer because not all the reviews were good.  </li>
            <li>A little loud on high</li>
            <li>I really like it because my hair did not take very long to dry</li>
            <li>I am willing to live with the design since it takes up a lot less room to store compared to a conventional hooded dryer.</li>
            <li>It failed that test, but it did dry the rest of my hair very well on the high setting, which was very hot, and had to be turned back to low after about 10 minutes.  </li>
            <li>With this dryer it took about 2 hour for my apl natural 4a hair to dry.</li>
            <li>My problem with this product is that it did not dry the back of my hair....</li>
            <li>The dryer was very loud but it did dry my hair faster than my previous (and much older)  dryer.</li>
            <li>It does everything that it&#x27;s supposed to do, I guess the only thing I&#x27;m kind of down about is that the shape is awkward enough so that sitting is also an endeavor at first.</li>
            <li>no... it is set with heavy gel to lay it down , wrap with tissue wrapped stripped to hold my hair in place for drying and then sit under the dry for a grand total of 20 minutes tops.</li>
            <li>Maybe if you had small rollers, you could fit, but definitely not large rollers.&lt;br /&gt;Heat</li>
            <li>a small propelled airplane is right next to you.</li>
            <li>But, I can touch-up that section with my hand-held in under 5 minutes for a complete dry.</li>
            <li>and I was able to dry my hair on the low setting, and I have very thick hair.</li>
            <li>so Im sure if someone isnt careful it could crack/break easily, and the portion that connects the hood to the base doesnt snap to hold it in place</li>
            <li>Dries my hair fast and takes up  little space.</li>
            <li>The dryer on high is really loud, I usually watch TV while sitting under the dryer</li>
            <li>Every one&#x27;s experience will not be the same, some will be good and some bad, it also depends on our preferences and what we are looking for.</li>

            <li> I am totally pleased with the Conair HH400 Collapsable Bonnet Hair Dryer!!  </li>
            <li> We love them!!</li>
            <li> Very, very nice product.</li>
            <li> but it dries evenly and was told it was very effective.  </li>
            <li> TO BE REAL CREATIVE)</li>
            <li> Wonderful dryer, works perfectly fine.</li>
            <li> I feel the Conair HH400 Bonnet Hair Dryer is a good buy for the price, works well.  </li>
            <li> Therefore it&#x27;s a good value</li>
            <li> This is a good price hair dryer.</li>
            <li> and i loved it.</li>
            <li> For me, I can shout it to the world, this dryer is a good dryer</li>
            <li> I was unsure when I bought this hair dryer because of the price, I had been looking for a good hair dryer and came upon this one, I bought it</li>
            <li> my mother loved her Christmas gift</li>
            <li> Good price.</li>
            <li> Good purchase.</li>
            <li> Good purchase.</li>
            <li> Good heat.  </li>
            <li> Of all the hood dryers available for sale here, this seems to be the best.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Opening and closing the dryer takes a minute to learn then you are good to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Good product.</li>
            <li> It does a fair job</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t understand conair is a good brand.</li>
            <li> And it didn&#x27;t feel particularly good to have the dryer then collapse on my head, after the latch wouldn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> The adjustable height made it so I have a perfect fit</li>
            <li> A good dryer.</li>
            <li> Have not figured  out to close.dries your hair really good.</li>
            <li> guess that can be a good thing though..</li>
            <li> Good dryer.</li>
            <li> and I still use it because I&#x27;m still searching for a good hair dryer.</li>
            <li> I suspect a good machine would cost $100 at a minimum.</li>
            <li> I know a lot of people will probably think this isn&#x27;t a good idea because it is still heat</li>
            <li> Good dryer</li>
            <li> Had many hair dryer before but this is the best ,easy to handle ,easy to closed,easy to storage, I&#x27;M so happy with this item best purchase !</li>
            <li> item is great, works beautifully its so easy to stored away ...</li>
            <li> and I also like the fact that it is compact so its really easy to store away when not in use,like under my bed!!</li>
            <li> Its great for getting the most outta looking good.  </li>
            <li> I Love Love Love this dryer!!!!!!</li>
            <li> This product works fine and the price is very good.</li>
            <li> but I am very glad I did.  </li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with this dryer (&amp; the price)and would recommend it to anyone looking for one.</li>
            <li> So very glad Amazon had this product.</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with this dryer.</li>
            <li> This product arrived in great condition and I am pleased to say it lives up to my expectations.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very glad</li>
            <li> that if it had stayed on it would have FRIED the hair on the very top of my head while leaving the rest of my hair wet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with my purchase.  </li>
            <li> I was very pleased to get my hair dryer; it does a great job; I wish it had more settings.</li>
            <li> VERY SATISFIED.</li>
            <li> The height is just right when it is setting on a table, and she is very happy with it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very compact, has ideal temperature settings, easy to store and great to use!</li>
            <li> It creates a great volume of warm air that surrounds the head from top to bottom.  </li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s the best one available unless you want one that stands on a pedistal and occupies more storage space.</li>
            <li> I love this dryer!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad I got it!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> but it works better than mine!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I took a chance on this!</li>
            <li> iI LOVE MY HAIR DRYER!  </li>
            <li> Love it!  </li>
            <li> LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> I read all the reviews first and determined that it would give me the best bang for my buck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> - WOULD RECOMMEND LOOKING FOR A BETTER DRYER!</li>
            <li> keep your ends healthy!</li>
            <li> i loved how easy it was to set up and use this dryer!</li>
            <li> The price was amazing.  </li>
            <li> It gives out great heat and so light weight.</li>
            <li> The power of this item, for it&#x27;s price and size, is amazing.</li>
            <li> Thanks for the prompt receipt and great customer service!</li>
            <li> But, the fact that this bonnet collapses, and still does an effective job of drying my hair</li>
            <li> I had to create my own &amp;#34;salon&amp;#34; at home.</li>
            <li> The Conaire HH400 folds up nicely for storage.</li>
            <li> Once I looked at the instruction, it fell into place quite nicely.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t say thrilled or overjoyed.</li>
            <li> Folds up nicely.</li>
            <li> it gets the job done, I&#x27;ve had it for three years without any mechanical problems, an iPod solves the noise issue, and honestly four hours at home doing my hair...for FREE..beats all day at the salon.</li>
            <li> This Conair HH400 has a nice design and it generates sufficient heat and air needed to activate my non-oxidant hair color.  </li>
            <li> Kind of disapppinting.</li>
            <li> this was a nice upgrade/ replacement.  </li>
            <li> Although it was probably effective, I&#x27;d gotten it for my octogenarian mother.  </li>
            <li> I had to get my own.  </li>
            <li> This bonnet is perfect, the storage is so much easier</li>
            <li> Not so thrilled that it&#x27;s now a $50 dryer.</li>
            <li> I guess I will have to send my nurse to get me a bonnet at the beauty supply place kind of inconvient</li>
            <li> My daughter was drying her hair, and I honestly thought I&#x27;d be deaf after she finished using it.</li>
            <li> but in the comfort of your own home</li>
            <li> Pricing is good and Amazon.com ships it free, so I am very satisfied with the purchase.  </li>
            <li> I had to settle for slightly higher than ideal.</li>
            <li> the size is great for the large size rollers and the two settings gives you good options</li>
            <li> This new one will be staying at my house, lol!</li>
            <li> I wanted a dryer that was compact, easy to store, do a good job drying my hair and this dryer does all that.</li>
            <li> The PRICE is great  and the SHIPPING was quick.</li>
            <li> works well easy to assemble and disassemble and good price</li>
            <li> Heat settings and air flow are good also easy to fold and store.</li>
            <li> Great price and quick shipping.</li>
            <li> The hair dryer is very easy to assemble and disassemble.  </li>
            <li> Collapses very easily.  </li>
            <li> This dryer is very easy to transport and store.</li>
            <li> But it doesn&#x27;t really do so very easily.</li>
            <li> Conair is offering a great product at a very reasonable price!</li>
            <li> My Mom is 96 years old and her hairdresser has started coming to the house to fix her hair and this dryer has worked wonderfully.  </li>
            <li> As far as drying your hair it does a great job!</li>
            <li> but I must be able to save some kind of money .So</li>
            <li> The two settings are great and it is a powerful dryer.  </li>
            <li> sure would be nice to get what I paided for</li>
            <li> but, my hair has never been better to be honest.</li>
            <li> that would make this hair dryer perfect .. butit gives good heat and seems to dry quicker than when im at the shop</li>
            <li> Construction of dryer isn&#x27;t nearly as good as the ones made 30 years ago, but this is true with all products.  </li>
            <li> It is also very cheaply made.  </li>
            <li> i gave it a 100% rating because it&#x27;s very comfortable</li>
            <li> and it is very light.  </li>
            <li> Very light weight</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so in love with this dryer, I could cry tears of joy  -- with the full confidence that this product could dry them up beautifully!  </li>
            <li> Love the power and heat of the item and it&#x27;s very light weight.</li>
            <li> Plus the fact that it folds up and fits in my bathroom closet is a huge plus!      </li>
            <li> The hood is huge!</li>
            <li> Therefore I chose the portable folding Conair Bonnet dryer and was almost completely pleased.</li>
            <li> I sure do like this dryer -</li>
            <li> I love this dryer.</li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> And I love that i can fold the dryer up and store it under my bed</li>
            <li> cuz hey, its free shipping!</li>
            <li> but I absolutely love it</li>
            <li> I got the dryer in 2 days and was able to do my hair for a friend&#x27;s birthday party that night.  </li>
            <li> b - I&#x27;m glad I purchased it - I was on the edge to purchase a salon dryer for about $199</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the design of this dryer.</li>
            <li> Love the Conair collapsible bonnet hair dryer.  </li>
            <li> Next best thing to going to the hair dresser.</li>
            <li> and I am glad I bought it</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t really satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> And while many people have commented about the stand itself, we have had no issues in setting this unit up.  </li>
            <li> I love this dryer</li>
            <li> If my hair was shorter this would be okay</li>
            <li> The product more than meets my expectations in performance.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m totally satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li> ok.</li>
            <li> As is-it&#x27;s just ok.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product three times and I am in love.</li>
            <li> and I use mostly the Jumbo sized rollers on my hair.</li>
            <li> To top it off, it&#x27;s flimsy.</li>
            <li> When I received the product, I was well pleased.  </li>
            <li> When I&#x27;m done there&#x27;s no frizz, love it.</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> and most of all i love the price.</li>
            <li> Does it come with all the features your favorite dryer had..</li>
            <li> The air does blow from the top of the dryer.</li>
            <li> I am very proud to have owned this dryer, it has worked well for the last 12+ years</li>
            <li> I had no problem fitting it over my rollers.  </li>
            <li> I have used this type of dryer for many years, and like this one as well or better than any</li>
            <li> So I decided to purchase this, &amp;#34;I&#x27;m glad I did!&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li> Better for my curly hair than a blow dryer which even with a diffuser messes up my curls.</li>
            <li> The reason I gave it four stars is because its perfect for deep conditioning, tho</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an okay purchase</li>
            <li> But if you be patient, it gets warmer and the blower seems to get more forceful.</li>
            <li> I love this hair dryer.</li>
            <li> I love this hairdryer.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad I purchased</li>
            <li> So does most vacuums and blow dryer.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I turn on my dryer to let it heat up, go wash my hair real quick, then get under.</li>
            <li> I love when boxes are waiting for me when I get home from work.</li>
            <li> Well, I am glad I didn&#x27;t miss out on this deal.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this hair dryer.</li>
            <li> and i love jow</li>
            <li> its ok not what I thought it would be.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not always cooking the top.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not horribly noisy (IMO).</li>
            <li> never thought to purchase one online via amazon.com, glad I did.</li>
            <li> However, it has been a great product to use and I am happy with it for the money spent on it.</li>
            <li> for sure i will keep looking for more items here.</li>
            <li> Im not in love with it</li>
            <li> so I shall seer what more this thing has to offer.</li>
            <li> Because of compact design, all the holes blowing the air are on the top of the hood and there are none on the side.      </li>
            <li> I do like the design and judging by the way it dries the top of my head</li>
            <li> I love my hairdresser</li>
            <li> I am so glad I brought it.</li>
            <li> will be on the look out for more items from this seller.</li>
            <li> I rather enjoyed my dryer.</li>
            <li> Many adjustable heights.</li>
            <li> The 3 height positions need the hair dryer to be on top of either a table, a desk or something like to work.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t have got a better one then this</li>
            <li> Love it, and would recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> and I could have bought something better.</li>
            <li> I tried blow drying with a diffuser, which does OK.  </li>
            <li> so I can wash my hair more often and forego the air drying.  </li>
            <li> I love how compact the design is as well for storage purposes.</li>
            <li> it  is ok does the job i realy cannot say much more about it.</li>
            <li> love it for the price</li>
            <li> I love this dryer.</li>
            <li> so it just bothers others around me :).</li>
            <li> I love and use it when putting my hair in curlers while trying to multi-task.  </li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Wonderful home hair Dryer can&#x27;t say enough about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;W</li>
            <li> After reading some of the reviews, wasn&#x27;t sure</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I don&#x27;t use it with rollers.</li>
            <li> but I LOVE me some amazon</li>
            <li> I would recommended this ConairHH400 hair dryer for sure.</li>
            <li> BUILT CHEAPLY AND WOULD NOT RECOMMEND!  </li>
            <li> Did you expect to listen to the Bible on tape as you sat under it or be able to hear the tv?</li>
            <li> I love that it doesn&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s blowing out fire onto my head, burning my scalp and forehead</li>
            <li> ENJOY THIS PRODUCT!</li>
            <li> but it works ok.</li>
            <li> and I sure wouldn&#x27;t recommend buying it.</li>
            <li> But for the price, I am satisfied.</li>
            <li> We bought a standing version instead and it&#x27;s much better.</li>
            <li> You have to stick your head all the way to the top</li>
            <li> I fell in love with it.</li>
            <li> I can put this on the table while I work on my laptop, i can put it on a stool while I play my video games, and i am glad that i got it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you have short hair (say shoulder length and up) this is PERFECT.</li>
            <li> im ok,</li>
            <li> Great with fast drying time.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> but it seems to be OK now.</li>
            <li> love the way it folds up for storage.&lt;br /&gt;PeterB</li>
            <li> But it is a very powerful hair dryer and very easy to carry.</li>
            <li> Pretty good.</li>
            <li> This dryer is really hot and it works really good.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this order and felt that the product was well worth my money.</li>
            <li> and it is worth the buy!!</li>
            <li> and I love the easy store option.  </li>
            <li> I like the most that it is easy to store.  </li>
            <li> I love that it easily folds up and stores in my bathroom closet on the shelf.</li>
            <li> Love this dryer , very efficient  at a good price</li>
            <li> (sure it will cost more but it won&#x27;t break in 4 months of light use).  </li>
            <li> does a good job of drying my hair on large rollers.</li>
            <li> This dryer is ideal for the very short crop cuts.</li>
            <li> Works great, but loud</li>
            <li> have had it for 4 months and it seems to be becoming noisier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It works great, it&#x27;s just really loud &amp; has a ringing noise while running.</li>
            <li> Great product thus far.</li>
            <li> I would recemond this hair dryer to any one that wants a compact, good hair dryer..</li>
            <li> Dry&#x27;s hair without drying it out, light weight, works great!</li>
            <li> I did... fits perfect with big rollers, dries hair evenly and quick.</li>
            <li> The bonnet is a good size to fit large rollers</li>
            <li> But other than that it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> Broke too easily.</li>
            <li> Its compact easy to store.  </li>
            <li> My wife loves this hair dryer compact, easy to store and use</li>
            <li> but it is well packed and can transport easy.</li>
            <li> It seems as if it could easily break.</li>
            <li> It collapses neatly and is easily stored.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s conveniently compact and easy to assemble.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s great for rollers if you have short hair.</li>
            <li> Easy to operate.  </li>
            <li> And to be honest, I am glad she has it now because this is much easier than me standing and curling her hair with a curling iron.  </li>
            <li> Also its easy to pack away.</li>
            <li> Opened easily.</li>
            <li> Easy to operate, easy to carry.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s height adjustable and easy to store.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s lightweight, portable and easy to assemble.  </li>
            <li> Folds easily and stores easy.</li>
            <li> Easy storage .</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to adjust according to your height, it drys all parts of your hair, and it easy to store away.  </li>
            <li> The materials seemed flimsy and easily breakable.  </li>
            <li> It is easy to move around.</li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s convenient and easy to set up.</li>
            <li> Bought it for a friend, it wasn&#x27;t as strong as she wanted, but others could use it.</li>
            <li> There should be more settings, as well as a cool setting.</li>
            <li> It works just fine.</li>
            <li> It is light weight and compact, easy to use</li>
            <li> It is slim and light and easy to carry.</li>
            <li> The replacement works fine.</li>
            <li> It works fine</li>
            <li> I got the dryer; it was working fine.</li>
            <li> , I think if I had rollers on or shorter hair this would be fine.  </li>
            <li> Bought a replacement whig worked out fine.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li> This one works fine.</li>
            <li> Which would have been fine for a $30 dryer.</li>
            <li> she has fine hair and hair get</li>
            <li> The dryer works fine &amp; the heat is descent.</li>
            <li> but if you don&#x27;t have nothing to do within your day then you&#x27;re fine.</li>
            <li> This one works fine.</li>
            <li> This dryer held up through it all, and dries your hair quickly in magnetic rollers, giving you a sleek, bouncy look!  </li>
            <li> The dryer gets very hot which I love because I don&#x27;t have to spend an eternity under it.</li>
            <li> Very powerful drying and easy to set up</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s comfortable and light  and easy to store.</li>
            <li> Even her hairdresser was impressed and when we told her how little it cost she was blown away.</li>
            <li> This has got to be the best little hair dryer I have ever seen for the non-professional hair stylist.  </li>
            <li> This product is compact and powerful, and is adjustable to quite a good height level; but if you have longer hair and need to sit under this with large (or maybe even medium) rollers this is NOT the dryer for you.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a hair dresser and this was extremely useful for my home projects :)</li>
            <li> style is important to my job, my image.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I did the free shipping option.  </li>
            <li> I am happy with it and would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> This one would fit in a suitcase.</li>
            <li> This hair dryer is great for deep conditioning and coloring.</li>
            <li> Cheaply made and it shows when you try to use it</li>
            <li> Yes, it&#x27;s made mostly of cheap plastic, but what do you expect for this price?</li>
            <li> So we instead purchased smooth rollers and a hair dryer for her to sit under.  </li>
            <li> I was looking for a dryer to help with my deep conditioning process for my hair and im happy</li>
            <li> and I can sit under this comfortably.</li>
            <li> , IT DID NOT SHUT OFF AT ALL &amp; DRIED MY SET HAIR PERFECTLY..</li>
            <li> Is comfortable to use.</li>
            <li> It fit on a shelf in my bathroom.  </li>
            <li> You do have 2 find a comfortable way</li>
            <li> What is with making these things so cheap and flimsy?</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s well made and the price is fantastic.</li>
            <li> so I recieved free shipping.</li>
            <li> My wife truly enjoy the dryer.</li>
            <li> dryer does not only have two great heat settings</li>
            <li> I bought this hair dryer because it was the cheapest (with the highest star reviews for the price) and has the option for free shipping.  </li>
            <li> this dryer is fabulous.  </li>
            <li> This dryer was more than moneys worth.</li>
            <li> I use those big rolos (Dominican) and it dries them great.</li>
            <li> This is a cheap item.</li>
            <li> I like the size &amp; fit of this hair dryer.</li>
            <li> My 90 year old mother used it and loved it.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t mind shelling out more cash, you can find what you&#x27;re looking for pretty easily.</li>
            <li> This sits right on the kitchen table or any table top and extends to the height you need it.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!!!!</li>
            <li> Absolutely!!!</li>
            <li> Very effective, even at the low setting.</li>
            <li> It is also very economical.</li>
            <li> The two heat settings are the perfect options -- I use the HIGH to get everything started and then switch to LOW to avoid overdrying.  </li>
            <li> Not too hot and very comfortable.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, easy to put away, nice hot air, dries my hair fast.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t ask for more, I am very pleased and I would definitely recommend to others.</li>
            <li> I loved that it collapses for easy storage and travel if necessary.</li>
            <li> Conair hair dryer is efficient, gets warm and does dry hair nicely.  </li>
            <li> Nice and compact and dries hair super fast and</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quiet, fits on any table &amp; the results are amazing!</li>
            <li> 1875 watts was the highest dryer I could find and at first I wasn&#x27;t really sure about Conair.</li>
            <li> I purchased this dryer because my original one broke.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure this will die in about a year, maybe two.</li>
            <li> First of all, I absolutely love this product.  </li>
            <li> Well, However the Bonnet will not fully deploy without first raising the top adjuster fully.</li>
            <li> I ordered it and have used it a couple of times so far, and I absolutely love it!</li>
            <li> A great low budget find, but I am challenged every time I try to close this particular dryer down, LOL!!!  </li>
            <li> Your hair will be dried rather quickly and it will look great :)</li>
            <li> The best part about this dryer is that your hair looks fantastic after you use it to do a \\&quot;wet set\\&quot; with velcro (or probably any other kind) of rollers.  </li>
            <li> After trying full hood dryers, I returned to the one I have been using.  </li>
            <li> If I had to pay full price, I would have rated this a lot lower.</li>
            <li> I have been doing my own hair since my beautician retired unexpectedly.</li>
            <li> No problem of any kind so far.</li>
            <li> The unit is also has the feature where the bottom ring of the hair dryer bonnet (the part with the CONAIR logo) can be removed to provide a more gentle hair drying.  </li>
            <li> this dryer serves its purpose, I&#x27;ve used it twice,and I am pleased, It is fast</li>
            <li> This is good if you have short hair</li>
            <li> I roll only part of my hair, then grab a good book and sit and read til&#x27;</li>
            <li> That is true.  </li>
            <li> so thats good enough for me</li>
            <li> The bonnet has good heat,but only 2 settings.</li>
            <li> This product is ok for the price we paid, but it is very noisy.</li>
            <li> I was lucky enough to have a regular sized head, so it&#x27;s a perfect fit for me.</li>
            <li> this is a very powerful dryer and it is worth every penny</li>
            <li> Not crazy about how the cord winds up - gets in the way, but dryer works great - runs 30 minutes a night to dry kids hair before bed.</li>
            <li> those that are very concerned about making this purchase, the hair dryer has some very unique advantages.  </li>
            <li> As someone said in another review, it mostly heats at the top, but overall, for what you spend, its what you get.  </li>
            <li> The salon dryer also has a &#x27;blow torch&#x27; setting which can quickly take care of all hair types.</li>
            <li> Dries my hair quickly.</li>
            <li> Love being able to sit under hooded dryer to deep condition.</li>
            <li> Broke way too quick, The bonnet part won&#x27;t stay up anymore.</li>
            <li> This one dries my hair quickly and it is not too hot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It was delivered so quickly after I purchased it that I could not believe it.  </li>
            <li> I quickly unpacked it and tried out</li>
            <li> but luckily the dryer has proved me</li>
            <li> I love that it collapses for better storage and there are several height adjustments.</li>
            <li> That smell quickly went away after about 3 minutes of having it on.</li>
            <li> This dryer came fairly quickly</li>
            <li> I can fit a head full of curlers under it and the hi heat is pretty</li>
            <li> If you need one, it is adequate.</li>
            <li> Easy to set up and easy to take down, heated nice and evenly.    </li>
            <li> The fact that it is converts in a flat box like thing is great because it does not require much space.</li>
            <li> it does exactly what I needed it to do, it&#x27;s compact and light weight.</li>
            <li> Good , gives you good heat that covers all your head, when I saw the negative reviews I was worried but I really like lit</li>
            <li> If I could get it to fold down the way it was supposed to, it would be great.</li>
            <li> if you wear your hair very short because most of the heat blow right on top of your head.</li>
            <li> This is a great dryer with low and high settings.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used a hooded dryer (at home) in many years and didn&#x27;t know what to expect from the new models.</li>
            <li> the hair dryer was exactly what i expected, it was a great size and puts out alot of heat.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s portable, easy to use, convenient, and very affordable.</li>
            <li> It works very well, is easily stored and doesn&#x27;t bother her to use as the  salon dryer does.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use and folds up compactly so it doesn&#x27;t take too much storage space.</li>
            <li> dryer is easy to set up, and heats very well.  </li>
            <li> It is easy to use and dries fast.</li>
            <li> Very convenient and easy to store.</li>
            <li> It drys my hair fast and It is easy to pack away when finished.</li>
            <li> She has long, thick hair and finds this kind of dryer works best for her hair.</li>
            <li> It only dries the top of your head!</li>
            <li> When placed on a sturdy surface such as my dinner table with a chair in front (which is how I use mine), I found the height to be perfect and the ability to adjust a little higher should accommodate most.</li>
            <li> It DOES have holes on the side, and was the right temp on high, not too hot but warm hot.  </li>
            <li> Im loving my new dryer although its not as big as it looks on the top part.</li>
            <li> &quot; said it was probably a manufacturer&#x27;s defect and didn&#x27;t sound like it was at all unusual.  </li>
            <li> it comfortably fits my whole head.</li>
            <li> It is light weight and really dries the hair.</li>
            <li> I got it on sale (it was about $28), so it was worth the value.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s comfortable, not too loud, and gives good heat even on the low setting.  </li>
            <li> The dryer is powerful.   </li>
            <li> makes this purchase well worth it.    </li>
            <li> This dryer is able to fit a big roller set underneath as well.</li>
            <li> So far, I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
            <li> hair dryer is quite powerful.  </li>
            <li> And again, the unit is quite powerful.  </li>
            <li> Would have liked it have different heat levels.</li>
            <li> This is a nice dryer to have IF you have short hair</li>
            <li> I think you will fully get your money&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li> This is a nice hair Dyer the only thing I do not like about</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m satisfied so far with it.......</li>
            <li> features are even better than my old one</li>
            <li> everything about this product is worth the price</li>
            <li> I am not crazy about the cord storage area.  </li>
            <li> One use in, and I am pleased with the product thus far.</li>
            <li> This really helped my hair look better than air-drying, and it was really inexpensive.</li>
            <li> so it was worth it for that price</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad my old one stopped working.</li>
            <li> This hair dryer replaced my old one of five years or more.</li>
            <li> Not a heavy duty unit but great for occasional use</li>
            <li> Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> But be careful, the bonnett tends to not latch good and will fall on your head.</li>
            <li> It is a pain to set up and use, it is not even worth it.  </li>
            <li> It is just like the regular dryers at the salon but more comfortable because you&#x27;re at home.</li>
            <li> Worth the money</li>
            <li> And it folds down really nicely, and could even be tucked up under your bed!</li>
            <li> I could assemble it and disassemble it pretty easy, but it was too much for her.  </li>
            <li> I love to wrap my hair and seat under the dryer my hair dry&#x27;s quickly and it good for doing deep conditioning</li>
            <li> It stores nicely and is easy to put up and down.</li>
            <li> Gets hot quickly.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t get super hot like salon</li>
            <li> Gets hot and dries hair quickly.</li>
            <li> and it dries my hair pretty quick.</li>
            <li> I am sitting under it right now.  </li>
            <li> Shipping was right on time.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t see right now anything I would not like of this product.</li>
            <li> right watt</li>
            <li> If you have short/medium length hair like mine, it might just be right for you.</li>
            <li> There is a huge gap because the 2 side of the bonnet do not lock together; therefore, much of the hot hair escape.</li>
            <li> Best $20 I&#x27;ve spent in a long time.</li>
            <li> If you have a sensitive scalp and most dryers are too hot for you, give this one a try.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not that good for long hair and it uses too much space.&lt;br</li>
            <li> the bonnet has an extension that flips down and makes a great cover for the rolled hair and dries it so fast.  </li>
            <li> Also, instead of having to stand there with a blow dryer and diffuser, you now can sit comfortably in a chair and surf the Internet while your hair is drying, so I&#x27;d highly recommend this for multi-taskers.  </li>
            <li> Finally, it is quite light weight and can easily be carried about from place to place.</li>
            <li> It has only two settings but they are more than adequate for drying the hair.  </li>
            <li> Through my college years, I really enjoyed the way it folds somewhat flat, for easy loading when moving; it doesn&#x27;t take up much space.  </li>
            <li> Given that this dryer only cost about $35 to purchase and I got free shipping through Amazon Prime, this didn&#x27;t seem like a good use of my time and money, especially since I strongly expect the replacement item to be just as cheaply made and just as likely to break o.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I noticed a distinct odor blowing at first</li>
            <li> The top gets very, very hot and the distribution of heat throughout the entire hood is uneven.&lt;br /&gt;2.  </li>
            <li> Hair drys quick, and it&#x27;s a nice consistent blow with a high and low setting.</li>
            <li> New product was in fabulous condition.</li>
            <li> I found the product to be convenient, the price is right and it fits exactly up under my bed.</li>
            <li> and you dont feel like your head has a large helmet on it!.....</li>
            <li> It heats up fast and drys your hair quickly.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this once to deep condition my hair and all i can say is so far, so good.</li>
            <li> It accomodates my large rollers and dries pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t take too much space and has very hot air.</li>
            <li> , it dries my hair very fast and it is so convenient to store and travel with.</li>
            <li> I have natural wavy fine hair.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m use to a lot better hair dryers for about the same price.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a dryer that would be adequately hot.</li>
            <li> I love it, and will definitely recommend it to my friends.</li>
            <li> Overall, we&#x27;re quite pleased with this purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Hood is not too deep so top of my head was overdried while ends were still damp.</li>
            <li> , it can get a bit hot on the forehead and eyes so try and use a cover.</li>
            <li> , it can get a bit hot on the forehead and eyes so try and use a cover.</li>
            <li> This hair dryer does what I need it to do, but I think the loud sound it makes when running is damaging to my hearing.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it, my ears were ringing for hours afterward.</li>
            <li> When you try to extend it to be higher, it tends to collapse.  </li>
            <li> Is it as hot as a salon..</li>
            <li> , I have curly fine hair and it dries it in no less than 45 minutes.</li>
            <li> but there&#x27;s isn&#x27;t really a good air flow to the sides, and tilting my head in different angles every 15 mins gets old fast.</li>
            <li> However, the blow-holes are only at the top and there are none on the sides.</li>
            <li> The first unit delivered was defective.</li>
            <li> It took a minute to figure out how the hood works, but once I got it running, it worked pretty well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s having to use a fan and convert room temp air into hot air.</li>
            <li> There are only holes in the top of the dryer, but there is a piece that completes the dome and directs heat around the rest of your head.</li>
            <li> - Gets pretty hot.</li>
            <li> Heats pretty quickly.&lt;br</li>
            <li> First of all, the unit is tippy.</li>
            <li> However, it is very noisy!</li>
            <li> :) ive only used it once</li>
            <li> it is exactly what she wanted.  </li>
            <li> This Dryer does get just as hot as one might hope..</li>
            <li> It gives out hot air to set my curls.</li>
            <li> this is the first hair dryer I&#x27;ve ever purchased online.</li>
            <li> I will opt for a better shape next time.     </li>
            <li> Now the neighbor comes over to use it and now I have two HOT HEADED women in the house.</li>
            <li> This unit is so well designed and packs away so well for transport or storage, I find it truly refreshing to buy such a well engineered product.  </li>
            <li> so i guess i wanted it more for deep condtion</li>
            <li> and it did have a funny smell at first</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad to finally have one and for a reasonable price!</li>
            <li> but i don&#x27;t like that the vent holes are only on top.</li>
            <li> No matter what I do, the hairdo doesn&#x27;t last more than a day.</li>
            <li> But glad Amazon took it back w/o any hassle.</li>
            <li> it can stretch out pretty tall.  </li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t need it that hot anyway.</li>
            <li> Makes my life so much easier with three daughters!</li>
            <li> I only use low setting because it gets pretty warm!</li>
            <li> it does work the dryer gets really hot</li>
            <li> First off this is the loudest dryer I&#x27;ve ever encountered.</li>
            <li> hi - unfortunately it is not compatible with our power source and will need a convertor-stepdown transformer for it to work -which</li>
            <li> /&gt;This may be a downside for some, the holes from which the air comes are only on the top, not the sides.</li>
            <li> Otherwise it works pretty well.</li>
            <li> Low power is much better.</li>
            <li> and I would then put on hot rollers).</li>
            <li> The heat is evenly distributed and it is not overly hot in my opinion.</li>
            <li> No complaints, very sturdy, worth the money.  </li>
            <li> I use it pretty often during my wash days now.</li>
            <li> Others who had a previous dryer they loved, or who really want to reproduce salon results may want to go with a higher end dryer.</li>
            <li> I find that setting the dryer on a average height dining room table (don&#x27;t have the tall kind) or a computer desk allows for the right height to sit underneath with a dining or office chair.</li>
            <li> DO NOT ATTEMPT TO USE PROUCT TO DRY TEARS OF JOY; USE A FACIAL TISSUE AND SEE YOUR PSYCHIATRIST.</li>
            <li> this is a great hair dryer for the price, my hair is short and my hair is dry within 20 to 30 minutes.</li>
            <li> Directions are easily followed.&lt;br /&gt;Drying time is much quicker than our old one.  </li>
            <li> It is very compact and delivers just the right amount of heat.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with it light weight but only has 2 speeds high and low.  </li>
            <li> But other than it&#x27;s really nice because it&#x27;s a space saver</li>
            <li> HOWEVER, the vents are only in the top of the dryer, so it feels like it is burning the top of your head, but doesn&#x27;t dry the sides and bottom portion of hair.</li>
            <li> It is an OK dryer, but must put it on high for a quick dry.</li>
            <li> Also, the sound is very loud at the high setting.</li>
            <li> It gets plenty hot and very versitile.</li>
            <li> This hairdryer is a bit weaker (not as hot and not as much power) as my hand held, but I like that</li>
            <li> It is very loud (especially on high) and the neck could be a tad longer.</li>
            <li> It dries hair pretty fast, but the noise deafening.  </li>
            <li> The only thing about it that makes it unlike a salon dryer is that you have to kind of move your head around for a few minutes before you finish to make sure each part dries evenly.</li>
            <li> For the price, it does a good job if you are willing to move your head around to get the back of your hair dry.  </li>
            <li> a bit *too* high and low setting is more like medium.</li>
            <li> So, i have to stay under the dryer longer to make sure that the hair in rollers at the bottom also get dry.  </li>
            <li> this model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The dryer is very compact, about the size of a shoebox that a pair of boots come in, and it gets hot fast and dries your hair</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so easy to fold back up and store this dryer as well, which keeps it out of the way when I am not using it.</li>
            <li> I took my chances on buying the dryer even though the reviews were less than kind to the product.</li>
            <li> Most of the time I air dry my hair.  </li>
            <li> It is compact enough to store easily.  </li>
            <li> I still just wiped it down for own peace of mind, but I really did not have to.</li>
            <li> I use large to jumbo size rollers and it fits well under the width of the dryer bonnet.  </li>
            <li> As far as the circumference of the bonnet - I think I have a fairly large head (like Elaine from Seinfeld - haha!), especially with velcro rollers in, and I have no problem fitting my head under the bonnet.  </li>
            <li> Liked this dryer, only problem is low setting is too hot, otherwise I would give it five stars.  </li>
            <li> While it does the top of my head nicely, the bottom half stays wet, even after 45 minutes.</li>
            <li> Only the top portion of my head fit underneath so the majority of my hair would not get dry if I were to use this dryer.  </li>
            <li> I have fine hair, and bend my neck to reach the back and then move my head side to side.  </li>
            <li> Its condition is good, and very helpful when I use it daily to dry my hair .  </li>
            <li> On top of it all, the product was very cleverly designed in that it collapses into a small carry-on (a bit smaller than the size on your grocery store baskets) which makes it very easy to store.   </li>
            <li> I really try to avoid heat but to deep conditioner I figure this is fine.</li>
            <li> It collapses flat for easy storage and travel (via car).  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyway, as a few others stated, the bonnet doesnt line up for a secure snap on fit.</li>
            <li> It saves me time and money, which I really appreciate.</li>
            <li> I feel the air drying my whole head.  </li>
            <li> Cheaply made but does put out enough heat and air.</li>
            <li> Doubt if it will get much use.</li>
            <li> I really like this dryer.</li>
            <li> I hear about this dryer so much from people who have used it over the years and it does the job.  </li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t to put too much heat on your hair</li>
            <li> Its very portable.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Finally, the transaction went very well.  </li>
            <li> The delivery time fast.  </li>
            <li> I really like this product</li>
            <li> All this, coupled with the free shipping (qualified for order above $25 free shipping) and on time delivery, I would definitely recommend this item to a friend!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;March 22nd 2017:</li>
            <li> It is also adjustable and it wide so you can sit comfortably under it with rollers!</li>
            <li> it shipped fast and it was a reasonable price</li>
            <li> One Blue plastic knob on side of bonnet broke after light use but beyond the 30 day amazon return window.  </li>
            <li> I will write a follow up review letting everyone know how the replacement item holds up (not expecting much).ement item holds up (not expecting much).</li>
            <li> Its a $30 dryer, so how much can you expect.</li>
            <li> The dryer works very well for me.</li>
            <li> Purchased this for my aunt, and she really likes it.  </li>
            <li> Dries my hair fast - but hood needs to be deeper.  </li>
            <li> Works very well...lots of power.  </li>
            <li> Dries fast.  </li>
            <li> It works really well</li>
            <li> The dryer heats very well</li>
            <li> Thanks Amazon.</li>
            <li> and my hair is ready to go.  </li>
            <li> I have had my dryer for a whole now.</li>
            <li> and I really wanted this type of dryer</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t recommend it at all.</li>
            <li> It dries my hair fast, fyi</li>
            <li> I will be ordering another one just in case this one blows out as much as i use it.</li>
            <li> Not used very often</li>
            <li> It works very well</li>
            <li> thanks Michelle</li>
            <li> I dont really have a place I can put this.  </li>
            <li> It really evenly distributes the heat onto your whole head unless you have a dino megahead.</li>
            <li> but this is very roomy and spacious.</li>
            <li> I have very curly hair</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no way around it, really.</li>
            <li> fact that big rollers don&#x27;t quite fit.</li>
            <li> I put on coconut oil (or almond oil...or grape seed oil, depends on my mood haha)</li>
            <li> Your hair really absorbs the product so</li>
            <li> This dryer works very well</li>
            <li> That said, I consider $30ish to be a reasonable annual purchase</li>
            <li> It dries the hair with rollers very well.</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> I actually felt it was better than the salon dryers because when i put in my pearl bud ear phones, the noise was cut off almost completely</li>
            <li> It has at least three (probably more like five) distinct levels at which a person can position it which I think is good enough for a portable collapsible standing dryer such as this one.</li>
            <li> This dryer would work well if you have a perfect table behind your chair and don&#x27;t have a lot of hair at the back of your neck.</li>
            <li> (I havent had issues with it folding back, but I wouldve liked the extra measure to ensure it wouldnt).</li>
            <li> On low, the sound of the dryer is bearable, but the entire dryer doesn&#x27;t get warm enough to really get the heat going.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Nice hair dryer that I only use when I deep conditioner my daughter and my hair.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t find it particularly noisy and since I have fairly short hair, it all dries easily by just tilting my head a bit from side to side or forward during the 5 minutes</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like that the little air vents are just right at the top of the dryer.</li>
            <li> It just blew hot hair, didn&#x27;t really provide a smooth, heated dry, which is what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> For starters it&#x27;s LOUD!!!</li>
            <li> WASN&#x27;T SATISFIED WITH MY OTHER ONE.  </li>
            <li> It might be too hot for really delicate hair but overall works great for the price.</li>
            <li> i love it even thou other</li>
            <li> I have spent a lot more on dryers trying to find a replacement for my Lady Schick that I received as a high school graduation gift in 1976 (held together with duct tape and bungee cords), and this dryer comes closest in power and drying capacity.</li>
            <li> This product folds and stores nicely and is the right size for jumbo curlers, heats evenly and high heat dries my thick hair under 25 minutes.</li>
            <li> I have older bonnet style models that are much quieter.</li>
            <li> The dryer gets it dry, very quickly she says.</li>
            <li> Love that it folds down to a reasonable height.</li>
            <li> It was just the right temperature on high--not too hot that my ears burned, and not too low that I didn&#x27;t feel any heat.  </li>
            <li> The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because the side knobs came off easily and one completely broke off</li>
            <li> I was looking for a bonnet dryer for a while, hoping it would free me up to multi-task while my velcro rollers set my long hair.  </li>
            <li> I would say the average woman with shoulder length hair will be satisfied with this dryer.</li>
            <li> The dryer heats hot like a professional hair dryer.  </li>
            <li> Kind of awkward to close but overall a good hairdryer.</li>
            <li> Will use for five to ten minutes, let it cool off then start again.</li>
            <li> Yes it&#x27;s true, it doesn&#x27;t cover the very back of your head (by your neck)</li>
            <li> As others have said, while I used to dread the time wasted while drying my hair with a normal hair dryer, now I can get out of bed, jump in the shower, and then spend the time while my hair is drying catching up on everything on my phone that I would normally have before getting out of bed.  </li>
            <li> I love that you can have the hood up or down.</li>
            <li> I would imagine the high setting would be as hot if not hotter than the professional dryers in the salon.</li>
            <li> I also LOVE the fact that this dryer folds up, I can store it underneath my guest bed with a typical metal frame.</li>
            <li> This is fabulous, as I paid triple the price for another hooded dryer that took 1 and 1/2 hours to dry my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> (my main reason for choosing this product)  </li>
            <li> For the price it is a decent dryer-just be prepared for uneveness of drying on head of hair.</li>
            <li> This is a decent dryer.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this particular dryer to anyone.</li>
            <li> This particular one required muscles of steel to try to yank it upward.</li>
            <li> Id suggest to turn the hooded dryer on low for 30min for the first run just to get rid of the hot plastic smell, before using it.</li>
            <li> Not that noisy, heats quickly, the size of the hood is big.</li>
            <li> I was a little weary at first knowing that heat only comes from the top and not the sides, but if you let the dryer heat up for about 15 prior to use, it will work just fine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m amazed that this reasonably priced, relatively lightweight dryer has the look, feel and function of something right out of a salon.  </li>
            <li> sure is better than a normal blow dryer because you do not have to keep holding it, but next time I&#x27;ll get the real thing, that stands on its on and actually dries all of the hair without you having to lower your head to dry it at the back.</li>
            <li> The high setting is</li>
            <li> I just can imagine what the high would feel like.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend the Conair HH400 Hair Dryer.</li>
            <li> Product works, but highly recommend ear protection.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I would recommend it highly.</li>
            <li> Some of the reviews gave it high marks which I cannot understand.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> And this was on high speed and high heat.</li>
            <li> Heats up fast, easy to set up and take down.</li>
            <li> This hair dryer does a good job at getting your entire head dry in a short time.  </li>
            <li> Get another model, spend a little more money</li>
            <li> The sides and very back of my hair dry last while the top of my head gets pretty hot.</li>
            <li> I can live with that, most dryers will not dry long curly hair.</li>
            <li> Kind of hard to maneuver.</li>
            <li> Works pretty good but, because of all the weight on the front, makes the neck very weak.</li>
            <li> This model is flimsy and sounds very high pitched compared to my old model.</li>
            <li> As soon as we reached the top steps to her house, the bottom portion fell out and ROLLED DOWN THE STAIRS!</li>
            <li> It did the job very well although as some users say it is a bit loud.</li>
            <li> Works really well for setting my 84 yr old Mom&#x27;s hair, (</li>
            <li> I really like this product so far.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great idea gone wrong</li>
            <li> I was able to do a flexi rod set and it dried my hair in about 50 - 55 minutes.</li>
            <li> The noise was not even as loud as the regular salon dryers or at most the same.</li>
            <li> A knob on the hood broke off within 1 week under normal use.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s normal or not.</li>
            <li> but I normally listen music or watch a movie while I&#x27;m drying my hair</li>
            <li> it is very loud on the high fan speed/heat setting, 2.)</li>
            <li> If I am able to use two outlets at the same time, I can use both dryers to get completely dry in the 10-15 minutes.</li>
            <li> I love this hair dryer because it can actually dry a short woman&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li> It would have been a 5 star had the shape been more of a cube to dry the back.</li>
            <li> It only dry the top of head.</li>
            <li> The low setting for heat is just right.  </li>
            <li> actually using it right now as I write this review.</li>
            <li> It does not dry as well or get as hot, but does get the job done, eventually.</li>
            <li> As others stated it is roomy enough for very large rollers.</li>
            <li> It was easy to set up and put down to store under my bed.</li>
            <li> it is so easy to set up and take down and store.  </li>
            <li> On the other hand it is stores compactly and is huge.</li>
            <li> Brand new out the box.  </li>
            <li> but it is because its new so its burnig it out</li>
            <li> it is good for when you need to use those hard rollers for the different look that you need, it feels like the ones at the salon.</li>
            <li> Amazon was happy to take back the broken item (they paid for shipping) and immediately shipped out a new</li>
            <li> Ok on my short hair but does not dry lower back of hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely no where near salon quality and not always worth the hassle of pulling it out to use it.</li>
            <li> The instructions helped but I didn&#x27;t think they were very clear.  </li>
            <li> The Conair heats up but is very loud.  </li>
            <li> Bought this for my grandmother who had a very old school version of this</li>
            <li> but it very loud.</li>
            <li> But be warned this dryer is extremely loud and high pitched.  </li>
            <li> Both high and low fan speeds are hot, there is no cool setting available.</li>
            <li> Also, this dryer is sooooo loud!</li>
            <li> As for the arm, I was pleasantly surprised by the adjustments!</li>
            <li> The only issue i had was when I set it up the first time.</li>
            <li> , you will not be able to have it drape past your shoulder.</li>
            <li> I used it on the low setting, and it got really hot.</li>
            <li> Also it is pretty quiet.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never owned one before but it seems like it gets hot enough like the salon dryers.</li>
            <li> I didnt purchase this item from Amazon, but the one I have is the exact same hooded dryer.</li>
            <li> The dryer dries my entire head and doesn&#x27;t get too hot to the point that it would burn.</li>
            <li> old style curlers and the works!)  </li>
            <li> The only thing I didn&#x27;t like about it was that when I first turned it on, there was a burning-like odor that emitted from it.</li>
            <li> However, this dryer is LOUD!  </li>
            <li> Not worth buying cant get the flip to fit correctly so it has a gap in it.</li>
            <li> The heat is strong enough to dry the hair on rollers at the neckline, even though the dryer does not cover the lower part of the head.    </li>
            <li> If you have long hair or just enjoy using larger rollers for a fuller look, please select another dryer.</li>
            <li> It does not dry as fast</li>
            <li> and I like to do frequent deep conditioners and hot oils.</li>
            <li> I bought this new conair HH400 for replacement old conair HH400, this is a good product, but you should be very gentle when you close the cover, I broke hooks when I closed a little harder</li>
            <li> It only covers down to about the top of your ears.</li>
            <li> The old one quit working, so we looked for a new one which resembled the old one.</li>
            <li> Also, the dryer only has heat coming from the top of the bonnet and not the sides and bottom half.</li>
            <li> It is big, easy to put together and not much noisier than any salon types.</li>
            <li> The one thing I don&#x27;t like about this dryer is the holes because they are only located in the top half of the hood.</li>
            <li> I have locs so getting them all dry, especially in the winter, is important.</li>
            <li> Wish someone would design a hard hat bonnet style dryer that collapses but drys the entire head, not just the top!</li>
            <li> To clarify even further it only has that smell the very FIRST time its used.</li>
            <li> As for it drying only on the top of your head, that&#x27;s not true.</li>
            <li> the dryer gets hot enough so that it isn&#x27;t really an issue if you wrap your hair and sit all the way under the dryer.&lt;br /&gt;Burnt Smell - I noticed the slight burnt smell when first turning on the dryer.</li>
            <li> awsome for my new short cut dries in 30 min folds down to almost nothing great if you have small storage space</li>
            <li> I have never had a hair dryer this loud.</li>
            <li> Really loud.</li>
            <li> Next, the airflow on this dryer leaves much to be desired.</li>
            <li> I use this dryer for my naturally curly hair, after I use my Ouidad products (which takes me about 20-30min)</li>
            <li> Being naturally curly, I will also say that this dryer is safer than using a diffuser to prevent fly-aways and frizzing.</li>
            <li> but that could be because i was turning my head alot to tend to my 1 year old</li>
            <li> and I was pleasantly surprised</li>
            <li> And oh, yeah, you may want to throw in some old issues of PEOPLE and COSMO . . .</li>
            <li> The reason I bought this is that I have naturally curly hair that tends to frizz if I don&#x27;t get a professional blow-dry; on a whim, I had my stylist gel me up and stick me under the dryer and was amazed at how I ended up with even curls and no frizz.  </li>
            <li> There is no forgiveness in the hood height and no air circulating near your nape.</li>
            <li> and so far so good!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and i had no trouble drying my hair.</li>
            <li> This dryer meets my natural 4B hair needs.  </li>
            <li> I had an old hooded type and it was lost in a fire.</li>
            <li> The fold-away feature is a life saver for those with young children and for space proposes</li>
            <li> I bought this for my naturally curly hair as a way to beat my curly hair frizz.</li>
            <li> It is loud but it&#x27;s not unbearable</li>
            <li> I purchased this dryer for me and my two young daughters ( I do their hair myself).</li>
            <li> If you are a natural hair girl, then you will understand where I am coming from.  </li>
            <li> Professional results.</li>
            <li> just said it gets a lot hotter than her old one...</li>
            <li> and I cant hear the TV, its that loud.  </li>
            <li> I am naturally curly so on days when I don&#x27;t want to &amp;#34;wash-n-go&amp;#34; I use this or a handheld with diffuser.</li>
            <li> My Mom is 90 and her old bonnet dryer didn&#x27;t work</li>
            <li> I seems to me as though the entire unit itself is very flimsily made.</li>
            <li> I since my  lupus is in my joints so it is not heavy on my hand.</li>
            <li> After contorting myself to get as much of my hair inside the hood as possible</li>
            <li> However, it is not as loud if you are the person under it.</li>
            <li> The bottom &amp;#34;band&amp;#34; part of the dryer that flips around when you set it up doesn&#x27;t have any holes for air to reach the bottom of your hair near your neck.</li>
            <li> its also kinda loud.</li>
            <li> and I get professional results every time I use it.</li>
            <li> plus these dryer is extremely LOUD</li>
            <li> it is worth the price (~$37) and gets the job done with minimal discomfort.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m tired of wasting my money on a company that won&#x27;t stand by its own products and doesn&#x27;t act surprised when they break.  </li>
            <li> I mainly wanted a hooded dryer for deep conditioning my natural hair (3c/4a), but large enough to accommadate rollers if I chose to utilize it for drying.</li>
            <li> The dryer is &#x27;hot enough&#x27; to dry my hair in a reasonable amount of time.</li>
            <li> So sit under it for about 10 minutes, read a book and let it dry the top rollers and then the heat will work its way down to the lower part of your head.</li>
            <li> Sometimes it has a gap in the back because of how dryer folds down to close, but it&#x27;s an easy fix.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been able to work around this by a. moving my head (of course) and lowering the hood and holding my head down to dry the back.&lt;br</li>
            <li> its lightweight, folds up to a small package and can be stored easily  </li>
            <li> This dryer does exactly what it is supposed to do, which is to dry your hair.</li>
            <li> Too much heat on your hair is not a good thing though, so I think the dryer&#x27;s heat settings are fine as is.</li>
            <li> I was looking for something that would dry my hair quickly and this definitely does the job.</li>
            <li> It wouldn&#x27;t budge, then, reluctantly, edged up a little, then, pull, a little more, and, pull, a little more.</li>
            <li> This dryer is only deep enough to dry the top of your hair.  </li>
            <li> Naturally, the salon dryer is huge and extends down a lot further.</li>
            <li> but you get used to it and it has just two settings (High or Low).</li>
            <li> It comes in low and high settings.</li>
            <li> Low and high setting.</li>
            <li> Dries hair in 25 minutes on low no need to use high setting.  </li>
            <li> so air can reach the rest of your hair; but then all you can see is the inside of the dryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dryer has two heat settings-low and high, no timer, no as noisy as other hood dryers and a very adjustable height.</li>
            <li> My hair is about shoulder length and the dryer gets most of if, but the part past my chin doesn&#x27;t get as much air so doesn&#x27;t dry at the same rate os the rest of my hair.      </li>
            <li> Will be too small for huge rollers.</li>
            <li> I can never get the whole cord inside and it takes to long to accomplish the amount I do get inside.</li>
            <li> love how this dryer collapses flat and can be stored under the bed or easily in a small closet.  </li>
            <li> There doesn&#x27;t seem to be enough air circulating around to dry the hair appropriately, so even though my hair is short, it takes forever to dry.</li>
            <li> RIght now I am deep conditioning my hair under the dryer for 30 minutes, then I&#x27;ll dry it for 45m to an hour</li>
            <li> However, I couple negatives of this product are: it is not deep enough if you use large rollers.  </li>
            <li> The bonnet is also definitely big enough to use with my large rollers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> You will literally have to turn your head several different ways just to get a full dry.</li>
            <li> but I am definitely looking into purchasing a new one</li>
            <li> I purchased this dryer in July 2012 and now, three months later, I have to purchase a new dryer.  </li>
            <li> it did get my whole head dry</li>
            <li> It seems to dry at a fast rate.</li>
            <li> dry fast</li>
            <li> Great for me because it takes soooo long to dry my thick long hair with a hand held blow dryer.</li>
            <li> Works very well on my relaxed African American shoulder length hair.</li>
            <li> It is like a constant shrill scream, soccer match whistle kind of noise.</li>
            <li> I hate that people think they should only have to pay like $5 to get the perfect machine.</li>
            <li> The heat is even and hot enough to dry my medium length hair, without burning my hair or scalp.  </li>
            <li> its very loud sounds like a vacuum</li>
            <li> Aside from the hood being too short, the dryer being too loud and the limited heat settings (high and low),this dryer has been overheating and the plug is almost completely melted.</li>
            <li> I live in a small NYC apartment and love that it folds down for storage.  </li>
            <li> The bonnet doesn&#x27;t come down far enough to reach the nape area of my head without the roof of the bonnet touching the top of my head, so that was disappointing.</li>
            <li> All in all I am happy with my purchase so long as itll last at least a year and a half</li>
            <li> The other reviews about not drying the sides and back is right on target</li>
            <li> It has two heat settings: I use the LOW for deep conditioning, and the HIGH for drying the hair after shampoos.</li>
            <li> I wish I would&#x27;ve spent a little more money and bought a different dryer.</li>
            <li> I tried the large hard hood dryers but the air holes were only in the top half.  </li>
            <li> After being unsuccessful at taming my very frizzy hair (I am african american) with regular hair dryers, I thought that maybe a bonnet hair dryer would be the solution to help me achieve salon result (frizz-free hair) at home.</li>
            <li> I only used this dryer once so far.</li>
            <li> you can barely hear your surroundings.</li>
            <li> Even hand-held blow dryers are loud.</li>
            <li> I would say the watts are normal, my hair dried in a reasonable amount of time.</li>
            <li> Works well, a bit awkward, but considering the task it has to perform a good buy for the price.  </li>
            <li> Although it doesn&#x27;t dry the back very well.</li>
            <li> Just be careful w/ the way you handle it, it seems a little flimsy but it dryes my hair just fine.</li>
            <li> I dont know what the other reviews are talking about but the back of my head did get hot.</li>
            <li> few reviews complained about the back and sides of their hair not drying as fast as the top.</li>
            <li> Never adept at styling my short, fine hair with a blow dryer, I needed to use a curling iron as well.</li>
            <li> But other than that I would prefer a straight forward table dryer.</li>
            <li> than any other one that I have found, and it is very sturdy</li>
            <li> The dryer head is a little top heavy but workable.</li>
            <li> and I could hear the program I was watching on my laptop clearly without increasing the volume higher than usual.</li>
            <li> As such I do have to move my head around a bit to distribute the heat/air evenly, but it is much less work than my old hand dryer and dries much faster.  </li>
            <li> It is more difficult than her old Gold-N-Hot</li>
            <li> I am a natural African-American woman and I have been looking for a dryer for the sole purpose of deep conditioning my hair.</li>
            <li> I do not dry my hair with curlers in it, but the interior of this dryer seems plenty spacious to me.</li>
            <li> The only thing I found funny is that it looks like a dryer once it is let out, but once it is let down it looks like a space ship.</li>
            <li> maybe a little to hot on the hottest setting for some.</li>
            <li> I can tell when it&#x27;s going to happen now because it starts to smell a little bit funny</li>
            <li> Major complaints by OTHER reviewers include noisy/loud; bonnet too small for large rollers/big head; heating part located at the top so sides don&#x27;t get dried and sometimes, the arm not long enough.</li>
            <li> I havent used it with rollers yet, but I believe it is spacious enough to fit at least medium sized rollers (I have a big head).</li>
            <li> I ordered it because I have to use a dryer like this for my hair (I use very big rollers due to very curly hair...</li>
            <li> Apparently this item was a product from 2007 that amazon had in stock and sold to me; Conair wanted me to prove it was actually purchased in 2013.  </li>
            <li> And it is not a long hair dryer, maybe medium length to shorter.</li>
            <li> These are becoming extinct.</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical when I purchased the dryer because not all the reviews were good.  </li>
            <li> A little loud on high</li>
            <li> I really like it because my hair did not take very long to dry</li>
            <li> I am willing to live with the design since it takes up a lot less room to store compared to a conventional hooded dryer.</li>
            <li> It failed that test, but it did dry the rest of my hair very well on the high setting, which was very hot, and had to be turned back to low after about 10 minutes.  </li>
            <li> With this dryer it took about 2 hour for my apl natural 4a hair to dry.</li>
            <li> My problem with this product is that it did not dry the back of my hair....</li>
            <li> The dryer was very loud but it did dry my hair faster than my previous (and much older)  dryer.</li>
            <li> It does everything that it&#x27;s supposed to do, I guess the only thing I&#x27;m kind of down about is that the shape is awkward enough so that sitting is also an endeavor at first.</li>
            <li> no... it is set with heavy gel to lay it down , wrap with tissue wrapped stripped to hold my hair in place for drying and then sit under the dry for a grand total of 20 minutes tops.</li>
            <li> Maybe if you had small rollers, you could fit, but definitely not large rollers.&lt;br /&gt;Heat</li>
            <li> a small propelled airplane is right next to you.</li>
            <li> But, I can touch-up that section with my hand-held in under 5 minutes for a complete dry.</li>
            <li> and I was able to dry my hair on the low setting, and I have very thick hair.</li>
            <li> so Im sure if someone isnt careful it could crack/break easily, and the portion that connects the hood to the base doesnt snap to hold it in place</li>
            <li> Dries my hair fast and takes up  little space.</li>
            <li> The dryer on high is really loud, I usually watch TV while sitting under the dryer</li>
            <li> Every one&#x27;s experience will not be the same, some will be good and some bad, it also depends on our preferences and what we are looking for.</li>
            <li> Although I am afraid to use the high setting as I don&#x27;t want to burn out the motor, the low setting works fine for me.</li>
            <li> I must admit I was a little hesitant about purchasing this Conair model after reading some of the reviews on Amazon about the bonnet being too small to fit your head under (especially with curlers), or not drying the back of your head, etc.  </li>
            <li> The so-called adjustable height only goes up (a little), and it&#x27;s too high to begin with.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The heat of the dyer is enough to dry your hair but not hot enough to burn the skin on the back of your neck (like professional salon</li>
            <li> It does not have air flow holes low enough in the bonnet to dry the lower third of your hair....</li>
            <li> I came across this product on Amazon, and was a bit skeptical at first because it was so reasonably priced</li>
            <li> I am 5 feet and had a different hair dryer that didn&#x27;t go low enough for shorter individuals; my hair would barely dry</li>
            <li> It is poorly constructed and the air vents only cover the top half of your head.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It also tripped my circuit breaker after only 5 minutes on the LOW setting, so I can only assume it&#x27;s so powerful and yet so poorly designed at the same time</li>
            <li> i have a pretty big head and thick hair</li>
            <li> I use very large rollers and this bonnet was way too small!  </li>
            <li> I only use the low heat setting (quieter than expected) which is sufficient enough for deep conditioning (in my opinion), and doesnt scold your skin.</li>
            <li> Only issue is that it don&#x27;t dry the back to well.</li>
            <li> I bought the Conair HH400 Hair Dryer, was not thrilled with it at first,  </li>
            <li> I usually just listen to some music because the noise really annoys me, but it&#x27;s bearable...</li>
            <li> The bonnet was wide enough and deep enough to accommodate my head with rollers.</li>
            <li> I am writing this review because it took me a long time to purchase the dryer based on the mixed reviews.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> This dryer is compact and easy to store -- it folds to about 2-3 inches in height and the cord folds right into the side of the base.  </li>
            <li> It is loud and lifting it up and down can be akward.</li>
            <li> She can no longer hold a hair dryer for long periods of time or lift her arms past a certain height.</li>
            <li> I wondered if it would adequately dry the back and sides of my head.  </li>
            <li> It also folds compactly and takes up less space than my old dryer.  </li>
            <li> Some reviews say It can&#x27;t dry back of hair because of lack of depth, but the width makes up for that, so that the heat covers all hair.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry the back bottom part of my hair as well (I have shoulder-length hair).</li>
            <li> You have to tilt your head from side to side and forward to get you entire head dry.</li>
            <li> I read reviews that said that this dryer didn&#x27;t dry the sides and back of your head, but this was not a problem for me.  </li>
            <li> I also agree with review number one, it does not have enough hair hole to dry the front or \\&quot;edges\\&quot; of my head.</li>
            <li> I did not have to turn around in my chair to dry the sides or the back and the design makes its neck adjustable</li>
            <li> The only fault I find is the bottom of my hair does not get dry.  </li>
            <li> I am a black woman with medium length natural hair.</li>
            <li> But just to dry my 3c, but short, hair.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t really dry the back of my head</li>
            <li> I purchased this dryer to test whether it would distribute heat evenly to dry the back of my head.  </li>
            <li> And therein lies the problem --nit takes forEVER to dry my very short hair.</li>
            <li> and the only time it actually closed properly was when it fell off the table and snapped itself shut.</li>
            <li> It may work fine but was too difficult for an 88 year old grandma to set up and take down.  </li>
            <li> Like other reviewers have said, the dryer only dries the top of your hair, which makes the drying process exceedingly long and tedious.  </li>
            <li> I read a lot of bad reviews about this particular dryer , but it works fine for me.</li>
            <li> He was carrying it from the top handle and not supporting the bottom unfortunately.</li>
            <li> Decided to but this dryer after my other dryer finally  said it had enough.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s possible but, your hair will obviously be still wet in some spots so be patient!</li>
            <li> I also bought it for my little girl, who is also natural.</li>
            <li> It is a little loud</li>
            <li> It functions well, but its a little loud and</li>
            <li> If you have really long hair</li>
            <li> While I didn&#x27;t buy my unit from Amazon, I wish I had because their price is the same as the discount storefront I went to, but I spent time and money getting there to pick it up.  </li>
            <li> (That&#x27;s about how long I sit under at the hair dresser</li>
            <li> The dryers alo arrived two days earlier than expected.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t let them go outside with wet</li>
            <li> and you don&#x27;t have to sit under it too long .</li>
            <li> My hair is long now and I still use the dryer.</li>
            <li> My hair is not very damaged but this has definitely made a difference.</li>
            <li> As an African American woman with thick, natural hair...it was up to the job.  </li>
            <li> Unless you only have hair at the very top of your head, it&#x27;s crap.</li>
            <li> Sides - I have short hair, and therefore I wrap my hair around my head and use the thin paper wrap for the first part of drying.</li>
            <li> The noise brought it down a couple of stars but then it lost the final star when the mechanism on the hood broke after only 2 months of weekly use.</li>
            <li> We haven&#x27;t had this very long, just a few weeks, but so far me and my daughter like it.</li>
            <li> Even though the bonnet doesn&#x27;t come down all the way to the nape of your neck, if you tilt your head slightly forward, as you would anyway if you were reading/checking email, etc., it completely dries your entire head.     </li>
            <li> I had a hair bonnet the would dry my long hair in 45 mins.</li>
            <li> This dryer takes too long to dry my hair.</li>
            <li> I have been using Conair for a very long time.  </li>
            <li> My hair(medium/thick shoulder length hair) takes about an hour to dry.</li>
            <li> You may need to allow 15- 20 minutes rather than 5-10 minutes to dry.</li>
            <li> with this dryer my hair was dry in 45 minutes.</li>
            <li> and you would like all of it dry</li>
            <li> reviewers report having to turn from side to side to dry your head</li>
            <li> I sat under the dryer for 45-50 minutes and my hair was thoroughly dry.</li>
            <li> I would give it 5 stars but it takes over an hour for my hair to be completely dry with rollers.</li>
            <li> Now I have to hold it up while I dry my hair.</li>
            <li> are hair it not just water and air to dry.</li>
            <li> I got this hair dryer to dry my hair and it works and does what is it suppose to do-- dry my hair.  </li>
            <li> and I have to say that it will dry your hair evenly.  </li>
            <li> I have curly Hispanic hair and it takes about 35-40 minutes to dry.</li>
            <li> with this is; it does NOT have drying vents on the drying stand to dry the hair curlers around your neck.</li>
            <li> If you have a lot of hair, this might take awhile to dry your hair, so plan your day ahead of time.</li>
            <li> Even after I think it&#x27;s dry, once it cools off</li>
            <li> wrap my hair and am completely dry in 1 hour.</li>
            <li> It does dry the sides of the hair as well.</li>
            <li> I did think it take a while for your hair to dry</li>
            <li> I purchased this because I wanted to stop using &amp;#34;direct&amp;#34; heat on my hair (I didn&#x27;t blow dry, but I let my hair dry</li>
            <li> Took a few frustrating minutes to understand the setup...but my biggest complaint is the continuous ear piercing sound when it&#x27;s running on high.</li>
            <li> Very hard to find especially for the older gals.  </li>
            <li> The compact size is also a plus if you have limited space.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll update the review when I see how Conair does in honoring the (1 year limited) warranty.</li>
            <li> if Im using my computer chair, and I have no problems getting air flow to all of my hair if I lean my head down slightly (which was natural for me since I use my phone or read a book during this time).</li>
            <li> Difficult to extend hood to full height.</li>
            <li> so it takes a long time to dry...plus putting up when it&#x27;s wet also delays it)</li>
            <li> Why would Conair think that i would only want to dry half my hair?</li>
            <li> When that happens I&#x27;ll go down to my local beauty supply store and get one there.</li>
            <li> if only I could get my hair pinning technique down...</li>
            <li> Dryer does not extend heat down to the back of the head.</li>
            <li> Granted the sides dried last but all I did was to occasionally tilt my head slightly to different sides and all dried.</li>
            <li> the truth is you get what you pay for its not high end</li>
            <li> It has great heat cutting drying time down for her thick hair!</li>
            <li> It took me roughly about an hour fifteen minutes to get my rolled hair dry.</li>
            <li> I can sit there for 10-15 minutes instead of having to hold my hand-held blow dryer (with diffuser), which obviously only drys a small area at a time.</li>
            <li> I have had similar experiences with previous Conair hand held dryers but never tried getting Conair to replace.  </li>
            <li> I only use it 2 deep condition my hair( usually $10 in salon).  </li>
            <li> so I&#x27;ve always needed a little extra time for my hair to dry.</li>
            <li> The bonnet is small beyond comprehension, it would work only if you had a flat head.</li>
            <li> My hair reaches a little above my waist.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;However, I am on my third one of these in a little over 2 years.  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no easy way to dry the hair at the back of my neck.</li>
            <li> but I have thin hair which means my hair dries fast.</li>
            <li> The bottom of your hair will remain wet.  </li>
            <li> Dryer is somewhat flimsy so be careful in retracting hood and setting up height.</li>
            <li> The one thing I do like about this dryer is how it takes up minimal space after closing</li>
            <li> I expected it to look used, but to my amazement it was spotless.</li>
            <li> It was just as i expected it to be for my usage.</li>
            <li> dryer is a total waste of money.  </li>
            <li> The product arrived on time and functioned as expected.  </li>
            <li> I bought thus dryer because the space saver design and it it were not because the noisy drive my husband nuts and let me partially deaf, I would give a 5 star.</li>
            <li> Money well spent nonetheless.</li>
            <li> it wasnt what I expected</li>
            <li> I wet</li>
            <li> and yes if you use the big rollers on your hair, the bottom of your hair will not get dried, I use the medium sized ones</li>
            <li> i am an african american woman with really thick relaxed shoulder length hair.</li>
            <li> It seems to take about 1hr to dry hair in rollers, but I&#x27;m usually reading, doing homework, or my nails while I wait so not a big deal.</li>
            <li> If your head with double parked jumbo rollers does not fit you have bigger problems than a too small dryer.</li>
            <li> I have very thick, natural hair (black American) and needed a hooded dryer to avoid waiting 24 hours for my hair to airdry.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the first one fell on the floor and broke.  </li>
            <li> I do not have to lean to one side or the other.  </li>
            <li> I use every other day.&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li> I wish I had gotten one of the other bonnet dryers.</li>
            <li> Other than that performance has not diminished.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> Other than that performance has not diminished.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> I have to say that I have not had those problems cited by other reviewers.  </li>
            <li> To address some of the concerns of other reviews:&lt;br /&gt;Loud</li>
            <li> One for me and the other for my daughter.  </li>
            <li> It was a tad difficult to set up at first.  </li>
            <li> Once I ordered my other items they totaled $25</li>
            <li> I decided to purchase the Conair HH400 due to the price, and lack of other options, as a replacement for a hair dryer that I have had for years.  </li>
            <li> The many comments about the location of the air holes are irrelevant in my opinion, as my thick hair is evenly dried without issue or excess time.  </li>
            <li> While this unit will serve my purpose, I agree with some of the other reviewers that it could stand some improvement.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as noisy like the other reviewers said.</li>
            <li> So it takes my hair a little longer to dry.</li>
            <li> Our hair tends to take forever to dry and with this little dryer, it makes the process 10x faster.  </li>
            <li> No real support, and have to have a brick to hold it down, or it would fall over.</li>
            <li> It is hard to set up and it does not come down enough to dry all of your hair.would not recommend.</li>
            <li> It should be noted that I&#x27;m African American and I have very thick hair.</li>
            <li> This only makes 1) above a worse problem.</li>
            <li> Not worth the trouble each time, and I was afraid to argue with it, as it&#x27;s cheaply made and might break.</li>
            <li> When set for &amp;#34;hot&amp;#34; the cord gets very hot and am afraid it will start an electrical fire.</li>
            <li> I almost chose another more expensive option because of the negative reviews about the hood being too small for your head and rollers.</li>
            <li> I can dry my long, curly, thick hair in about 20 minutes.  </li>
            <li> You have to sit over an hour to dry long thick hair</li>
            <li> It is quieter than all the other bonnet hair dryers I previously had.</li>
            <li> too big and  hard to use and store</li>
            <li> HARD TO OPEN AND FOLD UP!  </li>
            <li> It smelled a little weird the first time we used it</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s no better or worse, really)</li>
            <li> It was too much to handle and too complicated to fold up and put away.  </li>
            <li> My daughters use to hate sitting under the dryer but they love to sit under this dryer.</li>
            <li> The shape and depth of the &amp;#34;bonnet&amp;#34; is not very comfortable to sit under and it is a bit noisy.</li>
            <li> The dryer shape and the blower power will send the heat down and around the sides of your hair.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t sit under it with rollers or anything, just with my hair down after washing it.  </li>
            <li> it folds down and has a place to tuck the cord in.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t lock in place and sometimes the neck of the dryer slides down as well.</li>
            <li> so now it won&#x27;t lock completely down for storage.</li>
            <li> The angle that it comes down could be improved.</li>
            <li> It comes down to this:</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t like to hold my head down cuz</li>
            <li> A little louder than expected, but It gets the job done for the price!</li>
            <li> So far, one of the worst $50 I&#x27;ve spent (original cost plus shipping cost to Conair for repair.</li>
            <li> In the salon, it usually takes an hour and 20mins to dry.</li>
            <li> I usually twist my hair and let it air dry</li>
            <li> I usually put it up in a bun when it&#x27;s damp/wet and let it dry for about 2 hours</li>
            <li> buy this if you want a high quality dryer, if you&#x27;re a hair dresser (or aspiring to be, if you plan to use a hooded dryer on a daily basis - you&#x27;ll get frustrated trying to dry your hair evenly everyday.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s compact, space-saving base and the way it was designed to be a self-contained storage storage unit small enough to fit under my cabinet.</li>
            <li> Not as heavy as other hair dryers</li>
            <li> that said, there are a few issues which other reviewers have addressed:&lt;br /&gt;1.  </li>
            <li> One and a half years.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s almost too shallow for my short hair cut.</li>
            <li> Over time, I felt the skin on my forehead was getting slightly burnt.</li>
            <li> Over time, I felt the skin on my forehead was getting slightly burnt.</li>
            <li> I checked Amazon and for $5 less, I could get it with prime in 2 days.  </li>
            <li> Seriously I would definitely recommend this item.</li>
            <li> My drying time takes less than 30 minutes.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d return it, but a previous review leads me to believe a refund will not be forthcoming.</li>
            <li> I usually have to use the lowest temp on any hair dryer but it takes forever to dry my long, thick, curly hair.  </li>
            <li> Even when you adjust the hood to the lowest possible height, you will walk away with parts of your hair sloppy wet.  </li>
            <li> : 1) provided a receipt proving I bought it in 2013 and 2) paid to ship the broken item back to them (likely costing at least half the purchase price).</li>
            <li> I usually wash and style wet.</li>
            <li> My hair is long &amp; thick.</li>
            <li> but I have long, thick, curly hair and it made it frizzy.</li>
            <li> But the worst is the fact that the actual drying area is so shallow that I can&#x27;t even dry the bottom of my hair; if you use large curlers for long hair, you simply can&#x27;t get them all into the bonnet.  </li>
            <li> The height of the dryer is also adjustable, so it can go down a few inches from it&#x27;s tallest height.</li>
            <li> And with my hair, at least five inches in length, in twists, I can get my hair dry in under an hour.</li>
            <li> So, I just played with it for a little while until I figured it out.  </li>
            <li> I buy through amazon for the speed and convenience, two words with which Conair is obviously not familiar.</li>
            <li> , just a little piece broke off in the area where it holds it to not collapse, (don&#x27;t know if that makes sense).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little noisy also</li>
            <li> I rolled my head around a little bit to let the heat off my ears and neck.</li>
            <li> Believe me when I say I do not have a little head</li>
            <li> I just tilted my head a little to get the air on my sides.  </li>
            <li> I just wish the cord was a little longer.  </li>
            <li> it is just a little tricky opening and closing.  </li>
            <li> I will spray a little silicon on the slide and get it to move easier.</li>
            <li> I wish that the hood  was a little thicker, but I suppose that dryers aren&#x27;t made as heavy as they used to be.  </li>
            <li> And because I don&#x27;t trust the construction, I&#x27;m afraid to fiddle with it too much.</li>
            <li> A waste of money, save your money and buy another hood hair dryer.</li>
            <li> It is a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had any trouble with the bonnet staying up on the height adjustment that I use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for a few weeks now</li>
            <li> No shipping charges and it arrive in just a few days.</li>
            <li> Does not fit over jumbo rollers.</li>
            <li> I took a star away because the plastic that creates the actual hood is quite thin</li>
            <li> waste of money</li>
            <li> my head would not fit under it.</li>
            <li> I think that I wasted my money on this product</li>
            <li> Once I adjusted the height and my sitting position, it completely dried my hair in 20 minutes.  </li>
            <li> my hair with my fingers while it dried.</li>
            <li> It is also unusually heavy.</li>
            <li> My mom loves it, she says it&#x27;s just like getting your hair dried at a salon</li>
            <li> This might work for someone with short, thin hair</li>
            <li> with any other dryer including at the hair salon i am usually under it at least 1 and a half hours.</li>
            <li> Other reviewers have complained about Instability, this has not been a problem for me at all.</li>
            <li> This dryer does heat up very well, however, the hood of the dryer seems very complicated.</li>
            <li> At least until I break down and purchase a steamer.</li>
            <li> it was super annoying.</li>
            <li> Got it for my wife, she tried it and it gives off very little heat.</li>
            <li> Dryer had to be returned because the hood is too small to go over the head when you have rollers in.</li>
            <li> Dries my curly hair completely on low in about 10 minutes and all I have to do is sit and read a magazine or play some Angry Birds.</li>
            <li> I put my products in my hair, and a few clips, and sit under this dryer while reading or answering emails (or playing games on my phone!).</li>
            <li> I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> I had an expensive one that I loaned out and never got it back.  </li>
            <li> but I was anxious to see the size of the hood.</li>
            <li> Using a 2500watt transformer; now it just dont work no more.</li>
            <li> my not i love it</li>
            <li> But that is a small inconvienence to get a dryer that works well.  </li>
            <li> No more time consuming, by blow drying my hair and holding a curling iron.</li>
            <li> It dries quickly &amp; isn&#x27;t excessively noisy.</li>
            <li> I found it impossible to watch TV or listen to music on the high setting.</li>
            <li> the bonnet is a little too shallow.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not like the traditional hood dryers; it has a sleeker design for the hood, that actually fits over the base when it is collapsed.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My thick, kinky hair, still got dried!</li>
            <li> I have long hair and after few uses came the disappointment.</li>
            <li> I think if someone had arthritis it would be near impossible to do.</li>
            <li> The negative reviews almost deterred me from buying it</li>
            <li> At least for me it was.</li>
            <li> i followed my gut into buying this insted of listening to the negative.</li>
            <li> At least for me anyway.  </li>
            <li> I have had it for almost a year now (writing the review late).</li>
            <li> So yes, if you have really thick hair it is going to take longer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a women of color with thick, relaxed hair, below the shoulder blades.</li>
            <li> Also, I have thick hair</li>
            <li> I have really thick long-ish hair (about 4 or 5 inches below my bra strap)</li>
            <li> She has surprisingly thick hair for an octogenarian.</li>
            <li> I mean you get what you paid for.</li>
            <li> but I am not satisfied with it at all.&lt;br /&gt;Sorry!  </li>
            <li> The only thing is, it has the collapsible hood an I am having a difficult time making it NOT collapse!</li>
            <li> I also found the bonnet to be very small.  </li>
            <li> Very difficult to assemble -- finally gave up.  </li>
            <li> Just a really weird part of the dryer to break down</li>
            <li> I also find it difficult to fold down.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d gone to several local stores and the prices were just insane.</li>
            <li> The noise when it&#x27;s on high power is very shrill and unpleasant.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s the only bad report for this dryer.</li>
            <li> whatever out in the cold with wet hair at your neck, forget this product.</li>
            <li> I wish I could send this back, I absolutely hate it and cannot believe that it is 1875 watts, since the drying process is so slow and inefficient.    </li>
            <li> I had to send it back :(</li>
            <li> I was disappointed when I received the dryer because the bonnet is not very deep.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Please don&#x27;t be dettered by the negative reviews, try for yourself!  </li>
            <li> I bought this to use to dry mom&#x27;s hair when the weather is too bad to take her to the salon.  </li>
            <li> With winter I wasn&#x27;t crazy about leaving the house half diffused.</li>
            <li> (my hair is very thick</li>
            <li> Conair is not a company I will be purchasing from again after speaking to them about the problem and trying to get them to stand behind their product.  </li>
            <li> Conair won&#x27;t stand behind their products...</li>
            <li> Received this item approximately 5-6 business days after ordering.</li>
            <li> On one side the knob has broken off</li>
            <li> However, it came with one of the clasp broken.  </li>
            <li> (burning) and you can see some of the plastic on the dryer base starting to bulge (I&#x27;m guessing from heat expansion of the wires).  </li>
            <li> Like a lot of other reviews I ignored before buying this, I was a bit disappointed.</li>
            <li> Not ideal but gets the job done.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately the quality was not great.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it is broken or if I am doing it wrong.</li>
            <li> Product arrived broken and the quality of the material it was made out of was very poor.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see from the comments here that this is a common problem, so perhaps just my bad luck.</li>
            <li> It is difficult to engage the bonnet and set it at a correct height.</li>
            <li> Sorry, it was a gift for my grandaughter.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this crap.</li>
            <li> I think if it was hotter though, I would find it uncomfortable to sit under.</li>
            <li> Ill have no qualms.&lt;br</li>
            <li> just sorry I threw all the packaging out</li>
            <li> The difficulty is that it&#x27;s difficult for an elderly person to fold up and store.  </li>
            <li> and it wasn&#x27;t that expensive.</li>
            <li> I am not impressed.</li>
            <li> Also, it&#x27;s difficult to adjust the the height.</li>
            <li> Product works but the amount of noise emanating from the motor gave indication that something might be wrong with it.</li>
            <li> UNCOMFORTABLE TO SIT UNDER</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s quite difficult for me to get it all in...</li>
            <li> The cap part is attached wrong and won&#x27;t set up for use.</li>
            <li> Though she just might not complain about anything wrong with it to her grandson.</li>
            <li> Dryer heats well, just not to crazy about the way you have to set it up.</li>
            <li> so I was initially afraid it was faulty.</li>
            <li> This one is so awkward setting up.</li>
            <li> It takes about 15 minutes under this dryer rather than an hour of&lt;br /&gt;air drying, and haphazard results with the diffuser.</li>
            <li> When I received the hair dryer, the part that you flip underneath was broken!!</li>
            <li> I was very wrong.  </li>
            <li> is very expensive-</li>
            <li> Bad design: &lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand the bad reviews regarding this product.  </li>
            <li> and it wasn&#x27;t too bad.</li>
            <li> Disappointing!</li>
            <li> This dryer is worthless.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed once I received the item.  </li>
            <li> I was very disappointed with the quality.</li>
            <li> Absolutely horrible design.</li>
            <li> This dryer is CRAP!!!</li>
            <li> I really hate this dryer!  </li>
            <li> But 1st time using it was horrible.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s awful!  </li>
            <li> but I find it very annoying to adjust the head.  </li>
            <li> Terrible experience.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> After trying full hood dryers, I returned to the one I have been using.  Unfortunately, the first one fell on the floor and broke.  I tried the large hard hood dryers but the air holes were only in the top half.  Therefore I chose the portable folding Conair Bonnet dryer and was almost completely pleased.</li>
            <li> Broke too easily. Kind of hard to maneuver. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend</li>
            <li> It works just fine. Gets hot quickly. The high setting is a bit *too* high and low setting is more like medium. There should be more settings, as well as a cool setting. I got it on sale (it was about $28), so it was worth the value. If I had to pay full price, I would have rated this a lot lower. It gets the job done, though.</li>
            <li> I bought this hair dryer so that I could do rollers for my daughter. It does it&#x27;s job. I loved that it collapses for easy storage and travel if necessary.</li>
            <li> I sure do like this dryer - it&#x27;s portable, easy to use, convenient, and very affordable. Definitely recommend to my friends.</li>
            <li> Great product and it does the job</li>
            <li> I love this dryer. It saves me time and money, which I really appreciate. The only thing about it that makes it unlike a salon dryer is that you have to kind of move your head around for a few minutes before you finish to make sure each part dries evenly. But other than that it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> I just received my hair dryer.  I am sitting under it right now.  It is quieter than all the other bonnet hair dryers I previously had. The negative reviews almost deterred me from buying it but I am very glad I did.  I feel the air drying my whole head.  I do not have to lean to one side or the other.  The low setting for heat is just right.  I just can imagine what the high would feel like.  I give this dryer 5 stars for the price as well as how well it works.  I am very impressed.</li>
            <li> I guess you get what you pay for. It is difficult to engage the bonnet and set it at a correct height. Not like the ones I had 40 years ago. Why did I ever get rid of it? Cheaply made but does put out enough heat and air. Doubt if it will get much use. Too bothersome. Oh well, yard sale material I guess.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a hair dresser and this was extremely useful for my home projects :) It gets plenty hot and very versitile.</li>
            <li> I love this dryer! I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s up with the mixed reviews, but this dryer is one hunk of amazingness that can travel ANYWHERE. Hair drys quick, and it&#x27;s a nice consistent blow with a high and low setting.</li>
            <li> I use every other day.&lt;br /&gt;Love it.&lt;br /&gt;Hair style is important to my job, my image.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll recommend to all.</li>
            <li> This was just what I needed as a gift and it was the easiest gift to buy.</li>
            <li> I just got my dryer in the mail yesterday and decided to give it a whirl and it was great.  It&#x27;s comfortable, not too loud, and gives good heat even on the low setting.  As an African American woman with thick, natural hair...it was up to the job.  My hair was \\&quot;set\\&quot; after about an hour.</li>
            <li> I really like this dryer. It&#x27;s very compact, has ideal temperature settings, easy to store and great to use! Thanks for the prompt receipt and great customer service!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s o.k. I wish I had gotten one of the other bonnet dryers. I don&#x27;t like that the little air vents are just right at the top of the dryer. It&#x27;s o.k. if you wear your hair very short because most of the heat blow right on top of your head. I&#x27;m use to a lot better hair dryers for about the same price. It will do though. Put it like this-it does well enough to keep me from having to send it back.</li>
            <li> I have used the dryer for about one month.  I love it.  Its compact easy to store.  The dryer is powerful.   And its not too noisy.  Just what I was looking for.  I recommend it.</li>
            <li> Dry&#x27;s hair without drying it out, light weight, works great!</li>
            <li> I was looking for a dryer that would be adequately hot. 1875 watts was the highest dryer I could find and at first I wasn&#x27;t really sure about Conair. But I have to say, I was impressed with it&#x27;s compact, space-saving base and the way it was designed to be a self-contained storage storage unit small enough to fit under my cabinet. Easy to set up and easy to take down, heated nice and evenly.    I would recommend to friends.</li>
            <li> This product is as advertised!  Directions are easily followed.&lt;br /&gt;Drying time is much quicker than our old one.  We recommend it&lt;br /&gt;without reservation.  Shipping was right on time.</li>
            <li> I have been using this hair dryer for almost 2 months.    it took me a while to get the hang of setting it up.  The instructions helped but I didn&#x27;t think they were very clear.  So, I just played with it for a little while until I figured it out.  I use large to jumbo size rollers and it fits well under the width of the dryer bonnet.  And I love that i can fold the dryer up and store it under my bed (my main reason for choosing this product)  However, I couple negatives of this product are: it is not deep enough if you use large rollers.  the bottom rollers on the side and back of my head only partly make it inside of the hood.  So, I try to tilt my head so that all of the rollers are inside the hood.  Also, the dryer only has heat coming from the top of the bonnet and not the sides and bottom half. only some of the heat gets to the hair on the bottom and sides.  So, i have to stay under the dryer longer to make sure that the hair in rollers at the bottom also get dry.  I prefer hair dryers that provide heat all around the bonnet so that the hair dries thoroughly all at once. But, the fact that this bonnet collapses, and still does an effective job of drying my hair makes this purchase well worth it.    I think its a great value for the price. I did the free shipping option.  got it in the mail after a week. didn&#x27;t mind the wait cuz hey, its free shipping! I am happy with it and would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> I was contemplating getting this after reading the reviews but I absolutely love it and I&#x27;m glad I got it! I got the dryer in 2 days and was able to do my hair for a friend&#x27;s birthday party that night.  I was able to do a flexi rod set and it dried my hair in about 50 - 55 minutes. It was easy to set up and put down to store under my bed. This dryer is able to fit a big roller set underneath as well. I hear about this dryer so much from people who have used it over the years and it does the job.  I&#x27;m African American and my hair is type 3a/b - I&#x27;m glad I purchased it - I was on the edge to purchase a salon dryer for about $199 and I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t! I save over $150 with this one! YAY!</li>
            <li> I feel the Conair HH400 Bonnet Hair Dryer is a good buy for the price, works well.  I wanted a dryer that was compact, easy to store, do a good job drying my hair and this dryer does all that.</li>
            <li> Bad design: &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;1) Unless you only have hair at the very top of your head, it&#x27;s crap. It does not have air flow holes low enough in the bonnet to dry the lower third of your hair.... So, unles you like to head off to work or whatever out in the cold with wet hair at your neck, forget this product. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;2) The so-called adjustable height only goes up (a little), and it&#x27;s too high to begin with.  This only makes 1) above a worse problem.</li>
            <li> too cumbersone.  too big and  hard to use and store</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the design of this dryer. I ordered it because I have to use a dryer like this for my hair (I use very big rollers due to very curly hair...it straightens and smooths without frying it) and when I travel, I have to lug it with me. This one would fit in a suitcase. HOWEVER, the vents are only in the top of the dryer, so it feels like it is burning the top of your head, but doesn&#x27;t dry the sides and bottom portion of hair. Also, this dryer is sooooo loud! I have older bonnet style models that are much quieter. Wish someone would design a hard hat bonnet style dryer that collapses but drys the entire head, not just the top! Just didn&#x27;t work for me...I had to send it back :(</li>
            <li> My wife loves this hair dryer compact, easy to store and use</li>
            <li> Love the Conair collapsible bonnet hair dryer.  It works great. Dries my hair fast and takes up  little space.</li>
            <li> This product works fine and the price is very good. Therefore it&#x27;s a good value however I believe you get what you pay for. The other reviews about not drying the sides and back is right on target but I have thin hair which means my hair dries fast. Also I supplement drying with hair dryer. Not ideal but gets the job done.</li>
            <li> Well, I was pleasantly surprised when the dryer came sooner that I had expected it. It is light weight and compact, easy to use and store.(I keep mine under my bed) It&#x27;s not like the traditional hood dryers; it has a sleeker design for the hood, that actually fits over the base when it is collapsed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a bit noisy but you get used to it and it has just two settings (High or Low). It accomodates my large rollers and dries pretty quickly. My hair(medium/thick shoulder length hair) takes about an hour to dry. I am very satisfied with this dryer (&amp; the price)and would recommend it to anyone looking for one.</li>
            <li> Have not used it yet but it is well packed and can transport easy. Can&#x27;t see right now anything I would not like of this product.</li>
            <li> I have been doing my own hair since my beautician retired unexpectedly. I had to create my own &amp;#34;salon&amp;#34; at home. This hair dryer is great for deep conditioning and coloring. Although I am afraid to use the high setting as I don&#x27;t want to burn out the motor, the low setting works fine for me. The compact size is also a plus if you have limited space.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t to put too much heat on your hair this will work. Only issue is that it don&#x27;t dry the back to well.</li>
            <li> This product works great. It is cheaper than beauty supply stores and it works great. You can put it almost anywhere in the house and use it. You can store it perfectly</li>
            <li> I use very large rollers and this bonnet was way too small!  Also the settings will not allow me to condition my hair. I was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> My wife has used this product for quite some time, and when her last one finally wore out I ordered another one as a replacement. She has long, thick hair and finds this kind of dryer works best for her hair. She sets the dryer on her bathroom countertop, sits under it on her dressing chair, and reads her Kindle while her hair dries. Next best thing to going to the hair dresser.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical when I set up the hair dryer because all the airholes are in the top.  I wondered if it would adequately dry the back and sides of my head.  To my surprise, it did.  It also folds compactly and takes up less space than my old dryer.  So far, I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
            <li> too shallow to adequately cover the head and tooooo darned noisy.  Cheaply made and it shows when you try to use it</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my daughters and they told me that it has been working perfectly for them. No problem of any kind so far.</li>
            <li> Conair hair dryer is efficient, gets warm and does dry hair nicely.  The big drawback is the noise!  I have never had a hair dryer this loud. The Conaire HH400 folds up nicely for storage.</li>
            <li> Dryer had to be returned because the hood is too small to go over the head when you have rollers in. Which is basically the point of this type of dryer. At least for me it was. The bottom of your hair will remain wet.  If you have long hair or just enjoy using larger rollers for a fuller look, please select another dryer.</li>
            <li> I love it! its lightweight, folds up to a small package and can be stored easily  It works great and I am glad I bought it</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t really satisfied with this product. The hood is too flimsy. Dryer heats well, just not to crazy about the way you have to set it up.</li>
            <li> After being unsuccessful at taming my very frizzy hair (I am african american) with regular hair dryers, I thought that maybe a bonnet hair dryer would be the solution to help me achieve salon result (frizz-free hair) at home. I came across this product on Amazon, and was a bit skeptical at first because it was so reasonably priced, I didn&#x27;t think that it would do the trick. I ordered it and have used it a couple of times so far, and I absolutely love it! It has two heat settings: I use the LOW for deep conditioning, and the HIGH for drying the hair after shampoos. The height is adjustable so i have the latitude to use it anywhere in the house. On top of it all, the product was very cleverly designed in that it collapses into a small carry-on (a bit smaller than the size on your grocery store baskets) which makes it very easy to store.   I love it, and will definitely recommend it to my friends.</li>
            <li> Replaced a 20 year old dryer and expected to upgrade. This model is flimsy and sounds very high pitched compared to my old model. It does not dry as well or get as hot, but does get the job done, eventually. I found it impossible to watch TV or listen to music on the high setting. On the other hand it is stores compactly and is huge. If your head with double parked jumbo rollers does not fit you have bigger problems than a too small dryer.</li>
            <li> Sorry, it was a gift for my grandaughter.  She is dabbling in hair industry.  I gave it to her she grateful for it.  That&#x27;s all I know.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using mine for a couple of months now, it&#x27;s a great deal for the price. Other reviewers have complained about Instability, this has not been a problem for me at all. Yes, it&#x27;s made mostly of cheap plastic, but what do you expect for this price? It is obviously not for use in a salon but it&#x27;s a great at home version. Dries my curly hair completely on low in about 10 minutes and all I have to do is sit and read a magazine or play some Angry Birds.</li>
            <li> We bought the Conair HH400 for my mother who is suffering with Alzheimer&#x27;s disease.  We needed an alternative to using a curling iron on her hair for creating curls.  So we instead purchased smooth rollers and a hair dryer for her to sit under.  This has worked perfectly (for us).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hair dryer is quite powerful.  It creates a great volume of warm air that surrounds the head from top to bottom.  The unit is very quiet (surprisingly quiet).  And while many people have commented about the stand itself, we have had no issues in setting this unit up.  Overall, we&#x27;re quite pleased with this purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those that are very concerned about making this purchase, the hair dryer has some very unique advantages.  Its very portable.  The entire unit folds into itself and is no bigger then a cake box when collapsed.  The unit is also has the feature where the bottom ring of the hair dryer bonnet (the part with the CONAIR logo) can be removed to provide a more gentle hair drying.  And again, the unit is quite powerful.  My wife use to work in a hair salon, and she feels that the unit is &#x27;salon quality&#x27; which means its works as well as you can expect a portable bonnet hair dryer to work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, the transaction went very well.  The hair dryer arrived on time in perfect condition.  We had no issues with this purchase.  I highly recommend the Conair HH400 Hair Dryer.</li>
            <li> I love this dryer it&#x27;s an awesome buy ,a must have for any hair care diva!</li>
            <li> Had many hair dryer before but this is the best ,easy to handle ,easy to closed,easy to storage, I&#x27;M so happy with this item best purchase !</li>
            <li> Works well. Would have liked it have different heat levels. But other than it&#x27;s really nice because it&#x27;s a space saver</li>
            <li> I was looking for a dryer to help with my deep conditioning process for my hair and im happy I brought this one The PRICE is great  and the SHIPPING was quick.I dont know what the other reviews are talking about but the back of my head did get hot. Im glade i followed my gut into buying this insted of listening to the negative. If you want a affordale hood dryer buy it</li>
            <li> Order arrived on time. Dryer is somewhat flimsy so be careful in retracting hood and setting up height. It seems as if it could easily break. Hood is not too deep so top of my head was overdried while ends were still damp. For the price it is a decent dryer-just be prepared for uneveness of drying on head of hair.</li>
            <li> I have used it about 3-4 times. It works great \\&quot;so far\\&quot;. Just be careful w/ the way you handle it, it seems a little flimsy but it dryes my hair just fine. I would buy it again...</li>
            <li> I was disappointed when I received the dryer because the bonnet is not very deep.  Only the top portion of my head fit underneath so the majority of my hair would not get dry if I were to use this dryer.  If my hair was shorter this would be okay but since I wrap my hair before drying, this dryer was not practical for me.  I did not use it so I do not know how well it heats.</li>
            <li> I bought this dryer about 1 1/2 years ago.  It has now died because the bonnet is falling apart piece by piece.  The adjustable part is also the locking mechanism when you close it.  That is the part that is falling apart.  As someone said in another review, it mostly heats at the top, but overall, for what you spend, its what you get.  One and a half years.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased a Conair HH400 collapsable hair dryer.  The delivery time fast.  The product more than meets my expectations in performance.  It collapses neatly and is easily stored. I&#x27;m totally satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li> This is a nice dryer to have IF you have short hair AND you do not want to set your hair with rollers. The bonnet just isn&#x27;t deep enough. It&#x27;s almost too shallow for my short hair cut. I have to move my head around to get heat on all parts of my hair.    That said it suits its at home purpose ok. If Conair would design one with a deeper hood bonnet (even if it cost more)this product would be excellent! As is-it&#x27;s just ok.</li>
            <li> this dryer serves its purpose, I&#x27;ve used it twice,and I am pleased, It is fast and I also like the fact that it is compact so its really easy to store away when not in use,like under my bed!!</li>
            <li> This is a good price hair dryer. Don&#x27;t know about how it will last, because I only have been using it for 1 week. Noise is acceptable. The stand is fixes so can&#x27;t adjust back or forth. I would it give it 5 stars if I can move it back or forth. I like it.</li>
            <li> I have very thick, natural hair (black American) and needed a hooded dryer to avoid waiting 24 hours for my hair to airdry. I also bought it for my little girl, who is also natural. I&#x27;ve used this product three times and I am in love. I haven&#x27;t used a hooded dryer (at home) in many years and didn&#x27;t know what to expect from the new models. I like the way this folds up for storage. I&#x27;m tall and I can sit under this comfortably. And with my hair, at least five inches in length, in twists, I can get my hair dry in under an hour. It comes in low and high settings. I couldn&#x27;t ask for more, I am very pleased and I would definitely recommend to others. I don&#x27;t have anything I would change about this product.</li>
            <li> I bought this new conair HH400 for replacement old conair HH400, this is a good product, but you should be very gentle when you close the cover, I broke hooks when I closed a little harder</li>
            <li> Great!! This gave me an all around drying. It stores nicely and is easy to put up and down. I really like this product and it is worth the buy!!</li>
            <li> I read quite a number of reviews before deciding to buy this dryer. Major complaints by OTHER reviewers include noisy/loud; bonnet too small for large rollers/big head; heating part located at the top so sides don&#x27;t get dried and sometimes, the arm not long enough. Having just bought  this a couple of days ago, i have only used it once but this is my assessment- it is worth the price (~$37) and gets the job done with minimal discomfort. The noise was not even as loud as the regular salon dryers or at most the same. I actually felt it was better than the salon dryers because when i put in my pearl bud ear phones, the noise was cut off almost completely and I could hear the program I was watching on my laptop clearly without increasing the volume higher than usual. I am African with moderate volume relaxed hair that gets just below my shoulders. I have a relatively big head with an oval face and I use mostly the Jumbo sized rollers on my hair. It took me roughly about an hour fifteen minutes to get my rolled hair dry. Granted the sides dried last but all I did was to occasionally tilt my head slightly to different sides and all dried. Again, this is about the same tilting I do with some salon hair dryers. The bonnet was wide enough and deep enough to accommodate my head with rollers. As for the arm, I was pleasantly surprised by the adjustments! It has at least three (probably more like five) distinct levels at which a person can position it which I think is good enough for a portable collapsible standing dryer such as this one. Finally, it is quite light weight and can easily be carried about from place to place. The only issue i had was when I set it up the first time. I did not read the  brief instruction on how to pull it into the standing position so I was initially afraid it was faulty. Once I looked at the instruction, it fell into place quite nicely. All this, coupled with the free shipping (qualified for order above $25 free shipping) and on time delivery, I would definitely recommend this item to a friend!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;March 22nd 2017: Update&lt;br /&gt;I have used this item for a number of years now and it is still working. One of the side knobs broke a couple of years ago so sometimes the hood comes off from its mount on that side but I just slip it back in. Other than that performance has not diminished.&lt;br /&gt;Also, it can get a bit hot on the forehead and eyes so try and use a cover. Over time, I felt the skin on my forehead was getting slightly burnt. I use a scarf and a face cap to shade my forehead and eyes from the heat when using it. Problem solved.would definitely recommend this item to a friend!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;March 22nd 2017: Update&lt;br /&gt;I have used this item for a number of years now and it is still working.

            <li> Absolutely horrible design. Like other reviewers have said, the dryer only dries the top of your hair, which makes the drying process exceedingly long and tedious.  I wish I could send this back, I absolutely hate it and cannot believe that it is 1875 watts, since the drying process is so slow and inefficient.    A waste of money, save your money and buy another hood hair dryer.</li>
            <li> I purchased this dryer from Walmart after the hooded hair dryer that I had died on me. This dryer is CRAP!!! For starters it&#x27;s LOUD!!! Really loud. Next, the airflow on this dryer leaves much to be desired. It only dries the top of your head! You will literally have to turn your head several different ways just to get a full dry. To top it off, it&#x27;s flimsy. A knob on the hood broke off within 1 week under normal use. Don&#x27;t waste your money on this crap. Keep looking.</li>
            <li> Well I was a bit nervous considering some of the reviews this product had received, but  the discription fitted what I wanted, and the price, so I ordered it anyway.  When I received the product, I was well pleased.  Some reviews say It can&#x27;t dry back of hair because of lack of depth, but the width makes up for that, so that the heat covers all hair.  It DOES have holes on the side, and was the right temp on high, not too hot but warm hot.  You may need to allow 15- 20 minutes rather than 5-10 minutes to dry.</li>
            <li> I bought this to use to dry mom&#x27;s hair when the weather is too bad to take her to the salon.  It works very well, is easily stored and doesn&#x27;t bother her to use as the  salon dryer does.  Good buy!</li>
            <li> Works great for my curly, frizzy hair!  I put my products in my hair, and a few clips, and sit under this dryer while reading or answering emails (or playing games on my phone!). When I&#x27;m done there&#x27;s no frizz, love it.</li>
            <li> I got this dryer for my daughter for Christmas cause I wanted her to stop using mine but it works better than mine! :) It has great heat cutting drying time down for her thick hair! It is also adjustable and it wide so you can sit comfortably under it with rollers!</li>
            <li> This hair dryer does what I need it to do, but I think the loud sound it makes when running is damaging to my hearing. The first time I used it, my ears were ringing for hours afterward. Product works, but highly recommend ear protection.</li>
            <li> The fact that it is converts in a flat box like thing is great because it does not require much space. I would say the watts are normal, my hair dried in a reasonable amount of time.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a bonnet dryer for a while, hoping it would free me up to multi-task while my velcro rollers set my long hair.  After reading reviews for multiple bonnet style dryers, I decided on this one.  I must admit I was a little hesitant about purchasing this Conair model after reading some of the reviews on Amazon about the bonnet being too small to fit your head under (especially with curlers), or not drying the back of your head, etc.  But I decided to take a chance and buy it anyway.      I have to say that I have not had those problems cited by other reviewers.  As far as the circumference of the bonnet - I think I have a fairly large head (like Elaine from Seinfeld - haha!), especially with velcro rollers in, and I have no problem fitting my head under the bonnet.  And after sitting under the dryer for 20 minutes, I have not had any issues with it not drying the back of my hair.  Even though the bonnet doesn&#x27;t come down all the way to the nape of your neck, if you tilt your head slightly forward, as you would anyway if you were reading/checking email, etc., it completely dries your entire head.     The best part about this dryer is that your hair looks fantastic after you use it to do a \\&quot;wet set\\&quot; with velcro (or probably any other kind) of rollers.  And the curls stay in all day since the heat \\&quot;sets\\&quot; the curl.  Plus the fact that it folds up and fits in my bathroom closet is a huge plus!      This has been a great purchase for me and I know I will use it all the time.</li>
            <li> I RECENTLY TRYED A CONAIR PRODUCT AGAIN, WASN&#x27;T SATISFIED WITH MY OTHER ONE.  I AM SO SATIFIED WITH THE PURFORMANCE OF THE CONAIR HH400, IT DID NOT SHUT OFF AT ALL &amp; DRIED MY SET HAIR PERFECTLY..STORAGE IS GREAT...</li>
            <li> Unfortunately the quality was not great. The dryer was very loud but it did dry my hair faster than my previous (and much older)  dryer. The noise brought it down a couple of stars but then it lost the final star when the mechanism on the hood broke after only 2 months of weekly use.</li>
            <li> (Note: review written by wife) I use this dryer for my naturally curly hair, after I use my Ouidad products (which takes me about 20-30min) I like to sit under this dryer to multi-task on my laptop or smartphone. This hairdryer is a bit weaker (not as hot and not as much power) as my hand held, but I like that I can sit there for 10-15 minutes instead of having to hold my hand-held blow dryer (with diffuser), which obviously only drys a small area at a time. I think if it was hotter though, I would find it uncomfortable to sit under. It doesn&#x27;t dry the back bottom part of my hair as well (I have shoulder-length hair). But, I can touch-up that section with my hand-held in under 5 minutes for a complete dry. If I am able to use two outlets at the same time, I can use both dryers to get completely dry in the 10-15 minutes. Being naturally curly, I will also say that this dryer is safer than using a diffuser to prevent fly-aways and frizzing. I also LOVE the fact that this dryer folds up, I can store it underneath my guest bed with a typical metal frame. I find that setting the dryer on a average height dining room table (don&#x27;t have the tall kind) or a computer desk allows for the right height to sit underneath with a dining or office chair. The height of the dryer is also adjustable, so it can go down a few inches from it&#x27;s tallest height.</li>
            <li> My wife loves it, she doesn&#x27;t have to make appointments/trips to salons every week anymore.</li>
            <li> This hair dryer does a good job at getting your entire head dry in a short time.  I&#x27;m glad I took a chance on this!</li>
            <li> i just got my dryer today and i loved it. i am an african american woman with really thick relaxed shoulder length hair. with any other dryer including at the hair salon i am usually under it at least 1 and a half hours. with this dryer my hair was dry in 45 minutes. it did get my whole head dry but that could be because i was turning my head alot to tend to my 1 year old so it had a chance to get every section of my hair. i loved how easy it was to set up and use this dryer! and most of all i love the price. this is a very powerful dryer and it is worth every penny</li>
            <li> It is inexpensive and does what it is supposed to do! I am very happy with the Conair bonnet hair drier.</li>
            <li> My 90 year old mother used it and loved it.</li>
            <li> Love this dryer , very efficient  at a good price</li>
            <li> I have owned Conair products before and thought I could trust in them.  I was very wrong.  I really hate this dryer!  When you try to extend it to be higher, it tends to collapse.  But the worst is the fact that the actual drying area is so shallow that I can&#x27;t even dry the bottom of my hair; if you use large curlers for long hair, you simply can&#x27;t get them all into the bonnet.  In addition, the space to store the cord is tiny and you have to crush the cord into it.  It is a waste of money.</li>
            <li> the hair dryer was exactly what i expected, it was a great size and puts out alot of heat.  it shipped fast and it was a reasonable price</li>
            <li> I like it since it does the job well.</li>
            <li> I purchased this dryer when my last dryer bit the dust. Is this the &#x27;best&#x27; dryer..no. Is it as hot as a salon..no. Does it come with all the features your favorite dryer had..probably not. For the price however, you can&#x27;t beat this dryer. I think you will fully get your money&#x27;s worth. I am writing this review because it took me a long time to purchase the dryer based on the mixed reviews. I decided to give it a try and as I mentioned I think I got what I paid for. The dryer is &#x27;hot enough&#x27; to dry my hair in a reasonable amount of time. When placed on a sturdy surface such as my dinner table with a chair in front (which is how I use mine), I found the height to be perfect and the ability to adjust a little higher should accommodate most. The air does blow from the top of the dryer. There are holes around the sides but only in the very upper portion. The dryer shape and the blower power will send the heat down and around the sides of your hair. Naturally, the salon dryer is huge and extends down a lot further. The salon dryer also has a &#x27;blow torch&#x27; setting which can quickly take care of all hair types. Too much heat on your hair is not a good thing though, so I think the dryer&#x27;s heat settings are fine as is. So yes, if you have really thick hair it is going to take longer. If you have really long hair and you would like all of it dry, you will not be able to have it drape past your shoulder. So, if you don&#x27;t want to pin it up this might not be the dryer for you. I do not dry my hair with curlers in it, but the interior of this dryer seems plenty spacious to me. I would say the average woman with shoulder length hair will be satisfied with this dryer. Notice I didn&#x27;t say thrilled or overjoyed. Others who had a previous dryer they loved, or who really want to reproduce salon results may want to go with a higher end dryer. If you don&#x27;t mind shelling out more cash, you can find what you&#x27;re looking for pretty easily. Or if you have the space, you could just buy the actualsalon chair/dryer used from Craigslist. They sell them all the time for under $100 bucks.</li>
            <li> For the price, it does a good job if you are willing to move your head around to get the back of your hair dry.  I have fine hair, and bend my neck to reach the back and then move my head side to side.  If you don&#x27;t mind doing stretching exercises while drying, it works.!</li>
            <li> This dryer lasted me about eight years until my sister broke it.  It&#x27;s been through the storm, I.e. Being stuffed in my trunk on top of suitcases while moving from dorm to dorm semester after semester in college; being borrowed by careless friends and family members, etc.  This dryer held up through it all, and dries your hair quickly in magnetic rollers, giving you a sleek, bouncy look!  I am African-American, with relaxed hair.  Through my college years, I really enjoyed the way it folds somewhat flat, for easy loading when moving; it doesn&#x27;t take up much space.  Wish I&#x27;d looked on Amazon for this dryer before buying another brand.</li>
            <li> Conair is not a company I will be purchasing from again after speaking to them about the problem and trying to get them to stand behind their product.  One Blue plastic knob on side of bonnet broke after light use but beyond the 30 day amazon return window.  Conair Customer service manager \\&quot;May\\&quot; said it was probably a manufacturer&#x27;s defect and didn&#x27;t sound like it was at all unusual.  However, she refused to replace it until I: 1) provided a receipt proving I bought it in 2013 and 2) paid to ship the broken item back to them (likely costing at least half the purchase price). Apparently this item was a product from 2007 that amazon had in stock and sold to me; Conair wanted me to prove it was actually purchased in 2013.  Makes perfect sense except I am the customer, I bought a product with their name on it and it broke. I buy through amazon for the speed and convenience, two words with which Conair is obviously not familiar. Given that this dryer only cost about $35 to purchase and I got free shipping through Amazon Prime, this didn&#x27;t seem like a good use of my time and money, especially since I strongly expect the replacement item to be just as cheaply made and just as likely to break o.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BRIGHT NOTE:  Amazon was happy to take back the broken item (they paid for shipping) and immediately shipped out a new one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BOTTOM LINE:  Conair won&#x27;t stand behind their products...my guess is because they&#x27;re made of cheap plastic and don&#x27;t last because of poor manufacturing quality control.  Save yourself the headache and buy something else. I&#x27;m planning on buying a salon-quality hood dryer (sure it will cost more but it won&#x27;t break in 4 months of light use).  I have had similar experiences with previous Conair hand held dryers but never tried getting Conair to replace.  I&#x27;m tired of wasting my money on a company that won&#x27;t stand by its own products and doesn&#x27;t act surprised when they break.  I will write a follow up review letting everyone know how the replacement item holds up (not expecting much).ement item holds up (not expecting much).</li>
            <li> I have had this dryer since before my son was born and he is now 12 and the dryer broke this morning, just a little piece broke off in the area where it holds it to not collapse, (don&#x27;t know if that makes sense). I am very proud to have owned this dryer, it has worked well for the last 12+ years and it is still going except for the issue this morning. Every one&#x27;s experience will not be the same, some will be good and some bad, it also depends on our preferences and what we are looking for. For me, I can shout it to the world, this dryer is a good dryer and I am actually on here to buy another one.</li>
            <li> This is a solid dryer. Its a $30 dryer, so how much can you expect. I used it once a week for my wash and sets. I would definitely recommend it as I&#x27;m about to buy another one. I bought it for myself but all the ladies in my family like it as well so it was constantly in motion from house to house. Christmas morning (today), my boyfriend and I were walking to my grandmother&#x27;s house with it. He was carrying it from the top handle and not supporting the bottom unfortunately. As soon as we reached the top steps to her house, the bottom portion fell out and ROLLED DOWN THE STAIRS! I should have told him to hold the bottom like I always do. This new one will be staying at my house, lol!</li>
            <li> I am totally pleased with the Conair HH400 Collapsable Bonnet Hair Dryer!!  The dryer heats hot like a professional hair dryer.  I don&#x27;t understand the bad reviews regarding this product.  I suggest you read the directions before using the dryer.  I did not encounter any problems when using the dryer.  Great product!</li>
            <li> This is a nice hair Dyer the only thing I do not like about it is,  that the heat does reach the back and the sides of your head.  You have to tilt your head from side to side and forward to get you entire head dry.</li>
            <li> Took a few frustrating minutes to understand the setup...but my biggest complaint is the continuous ear piercing sound when it&#x27;s running on high. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s normal or not.</li>
            <li> It did the job very well although as some users say it is a bit loud. I had no problem fitting it over my rollers.  Definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li> I was unsure when I bought this hair dryer because of the price, I had been looking for a good hair dryer and came upon this one, I bought it and I was pleasantly surprised, I have curly fine hair and it dries it in no less than 45 minutes. Then all I do it close it and store it under my bed, no muss no fuss.</li>
            <li> It may work fine but was too difficult for an 88 year old grandma to set up and take down.  It is more difficult than her old Gold-N-Hot she had had for years..</li>
            <li> does a good job of drying my hair on large rollers. was a bit noisy, but i put a towel under the unit and that deadened the noise.</li>
            <li> The dryer works very well for me. The heat is even and hot enough to dry my medium length hair, without burning my hair or scalp.  The heat is strong enough to dry the hair on rollers at the neckline, even though the dryer does not cover the lower part of the head.    I have used this type of dryer for many years, and like this one as well or better than any I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> Wonderful dryer, works perfectly fine. Dries my hair quickly. I would recommend it to all ladies. Its going to be my backup dryer in my salon.</li>
            <li> iI LOVE MY HAIR DRYER!  It heats up fast and drys your hair quickly.  I had an expensive one that I loaned out and never got it back.  So I decided to purchase this, &amp;#34;I&#x27;m glad I did!&amp;#34;  The hair dryer is very easy to assemble and disassemble.  I&#x27;m so happy that I made this purchase.  I recommend this product to others.</li>
            <li> Purchased this for my aunt, and she really likes it.  Works well for her situation.</li>
            <li> this item was compact and perfect. my mother loved her Christmas gift she was so suprised to pull this out of the box it was shipped in. she  had no clue what was inside .</li>
            <li> I use this for my deep conditioning treatments.  A little louder than expected, but It gets the job done for the price!</li>
            <li> This is the perfect hairdryer for traveling.  It is slim and light and easy to carry.</li>
            <li> And oh, yeah, you may want to throw in some old issues of PEOPLE and COSMO . . . I&#x27;m amazed that this reasonably priced, relatively lightweight dryer has the look, feel and function of something right out of a salon.  The two heat settings are the perfect options -- I use the HIGH to get everything started and then switch to LOW to avoid overdrying.  The reason I bought this is that I have naturally curly hair that tends to frizz if I don&#x27;t get a professional blow-dry; on a whim, I had my stylist gel me up and stick me under the dryer and was amazed at how I ended up with even curls and no frizz.  Well now I can get these same results at home!  Also, instead of having to stand there with a blow dryer and diffuser, you now can sit comfortably in a chair and surf the Internet while your hair is drying, so I&#x27;d highly recommend this for multi-taskers.  While I didn&#x27;t buy my unit from Amazon, I wish I had because their price is the same as the discount storefront I went to, but I spent time and money getting there to pick it up.  I&#x27;m so in love with this dryer, I could cry tears of joy  -- with the full confidence that this product could dry them up beautifully!  NOTE: DO NOT ATTEMPT TO USE PROUCT TO DRY TEARS OF JOY; USE A FACIAL TISSUE AND SEE YOUR PSYCHIATRIST.</li>
            <li> Works well. Is comfortable to use. Folds up nicely. Good price. Better for my curly hair than a blow dryer which even with a diffuser messes up my curls.</li>
            <li> Product works very good.  The dryer head is a little top heavy but workable. I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> It is a perfect size. It fit on a shelf in my bathroom.  I only used it once last week and my hair has been thanking me ever since.  It was just the right temperature on high--not too hot that my ears burned, and not too low that I didn&#x27;t feel any heat.  Highly recommended!!!!</li>
            <li> Dries my hair fast - but hood needs to be deeper.  Ok on my short hair but does not dry lower back of hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a women of color with thick, relaxed hair, below the shoulder blades. In the salon, it usually takes an hour and 20mins to dry. With this product it&#x27;s over two. The bonnet is a good size to fit large rollers but there&#x27;s isn&#x27;t really a good air flow to the sides, and tilting my head in different angles every 15 mins gets old fast. It is very loud (especially on high) and the neck could be a tad longer. The reason I gave it four stars is because its perfect for deep conditioning, tho it might take a while it gets the job done, I&#x27;ve had it for three years without any mechanical problems, an iPod solves the noise issue, and honestly four hours at home doing my hair...for FREE..beats all day at the salon.</li>
            <li> It works. That&#x27;s all I&#x27;m saying. I&#x27;ll let you know if I find any troubles with it. I&#x27;ve used it a bunch of times, and it works. My thick, kinky hair, still got dried!</li>
            <li> I mean you get what you paid for. This is a great dryer with low and high settings. However, the blow-holes are only at the top and there are none on the sides. So it takes my hair a little longer to dry. It&#x27;s an okay purchase but I am definitely looking into purchasing a new one</li>
            <li> There were some complaints about this product about the shallowness of the hood and it does have that problem. It only covers down to about the top of your ears. But if you be patient, it gets warmer and the blower seems to get more forceful. So sit under it for about 10 minutes, read a book and let it dry the top rollers and then the heat will work its way down to the lower part of your head. I&#x27;m happy with it and the price.</li>
            <li> Meets my expectation................similar to what I had..................so I&#x27;m satisfied so far with it.......just received it.........&lt;br /&gt;two features are even better than my old one</li>
            <li> Works very well...lots of power.  Heat output is also very good.  Love that it folds down to a reasonable height.</li>
            <li> I found the product to be convenient, the price is right and it fits exactly up under my bed. Good purchase.</li>
            <li> item is great, works beautifully its so easy to stored away ...everything about this product is worth the price it;s just perfect</li>
            <li> works well easy to assemble and disassemble and good price&lt;br /&gt;recomend for use as similar to a beauty shop article</li>
            <li> The 2 stars are for the price. But other than that I would prefer a straight forward table dryer. This one is so awkward setting up. It is compact for storing though.</li>
            <li> I love this hair dryer. .. So very glad Amazon had this product. Heats up fast, easy to set up and take down. Love being able to sit under hooded dryer to deep condition.</li>
            <li> The first unit delivered was defective. I was impressed with the simplicity of your return policy. The replacement works fine.</li>
            <li> Liked this dryer, only problem is low setting is too hot, otherwise I would give it five stars.  Good purchase.</li>
            <li> This dryer is only deep enough to dry the top of your hair.  There are no side vents.</li>
            <li> I needed a hair dryer for those days when going to the hairdresser just isn&#x27;t possible.  Love it!  It&#x27;s conveniently compact and easy to assemble.</li>
            <li> Good heat.  Dries fast.  Folds up into a compact case.</li>
            <li> This product is compact and powerful, and is adjustable to quite a good height level; but if you have longer hair and need to sit under this with large (or maybe even medium) rollers this is NOT the dryer for you.</li>
            <li> This dryer would work well if you have a perfect table behind your chair and don&#x27;t have a lot of hair at the back of your neck. There is no forgiveness in the hood height and no air circulating near your nape. I&#x27;ve had this dryer and am giving up and getting a bonnet style.</li>
            <li> I love this hairdryer. It is very compact and delivers just the right amount of heat.This hairdryer is comparable to the dryers used in beauty salons. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I prefer a bonnet hair dryer, so this product is great.  It works fine and I like the way it folds up.  I am not crazy about the cord storage area.  I can never get the whole cord inside and it takes to long to accomplish the amount I do get inside.</li>
            <li> I bought the Conair HH400 Hair Dryer, was not thrilled with it at first,  so I ordered another hood dryer, Vidal Sasson.  Turns out Vidal was worse/weaker and noisier, so I returned it and kept the Conair HH400 Hair Dryer.      This Conair HH400 has a nice design and it generates sufficient heat and air needed to activate my non-oxidant hair color.  Pricing is good and Amazon.com ships it free, so I am very satisfied with the purchase.  Of all the hood dryers available for sale here, this seems to be the best.</li>
            <li> This is good if you have short hair and you don&#x27;t have to hold a dryer.&lt;br /&gt;But I have long hair and after few uses came the disappointment. It&#x27;s not that good for long hair and it uses too much space.&lt;br /&gt;If you have short hair, have storage space and don&#x27;t want to have to hold a dryer it may be a product you&#x27;ll like. It&#x27;s a little noisy also but this was not an issue for me.&lt;br /&gt;End of story I sold on the garage sale.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and folds up compactly so it doesn&#x27;t take too much storage space. I haven&#x27;t had any trouble with the bonnet staying up on the height adjustment that I use.</li>
            <li> It collapses to 5 1/2 inches. Fits in linen closet. I have not tried it w/rollers. I only use it 2 deep condition my hair( usually $10 in salon).  You do have 2 find a comfortable way 2 set it up on table-took about 5 minutes. It doesn&#x27;t get super hot like salon but def does the job. I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s great for rollers if you have short hair.</li>
            <li> My wife says it is efficient and works great..</li>
            <li> It works really well but I had difficulty setting it up.</li>
            <li> Received this item approximately 5-6 business days after ordering. It took a minute to figure out how the hood works, but once I got it running, it worked pretty well. I used it on the low setting, and it got really hot. I would imagine the high setting would be as hot if not hotter than the professional dryers in the salon. One use in, and I am pleased with the product thus far.</li>
            <li> I read a lot of reviews for this product and others like it before purchasing and I&#x27;m glad I purchased this model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The dryer is very compact, about the size of a shoebox that a pair of boots come in, and it gets hot fast and dries your hair easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Opening and closing the dryer takes a minute to learn then you are good to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some reviewers report having to turn from side to side to dry your head but I did not have to do that. However that alone would not have prevented me from buying this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good product. I&#x27;d recommend.</li>
            <li> This is a decent dryer. It is loud and lifting it up and down can be akward.</li>
            <li> Not very well constructed and extremely loud</li>
            <li> Pretty good. Although it doesn&#x27;t dry the back very well.</li>
            <li> The Conair heats up but is very loud.  It is also very cheaply made.  I will keep it and use it for a time but I am not satisfied with it at all.&lt;br /&gt;Sorry!  I had purchased one from a supply house and it was the same thing.  What is with making these things so cheap and flimsy?</li>
            <li> it is good for when you need to use those hard rollers for the different look that you need, it feels like the ones at the salon.</li>
            <li> For the price it is one of the best dryer you can have.  My Mom is 96 years old and her hairdresser has started coming to the house to fix her hair and this dryer has worked wonderfully.  Even her hairdresser was impressed and when we told her how little it cost she was blown away.</li>
            <li> Magnificent product.  I used it a couple of times already and it dries my hair perfectly.  I am very satisfied with this dryer.</li>
            <li> I only used this dryer once so far. Good product. I wish that the hood  was a little thicker, but I suppose that dryers aren&#x27;t made as heavy as they used to be.  But it works well.  Gets hot and dries hair quickly.</li>
            <li> A bit cumbersome. It does a fair job</li>
            <li> To address some of the concerns of other reviews:&lt;br /&gt;Loud Noise - It&#x27;s a hair dryer. It&#x27;s having to use a fan and convert room temp air into hot air. It makes noise. So does most vacuums and blow dryer.&lt;br /&gt;Dry Sides - I have short hair, and therefore I wrap my hair around my head and use the thin paper wrap for the first part of drying. Since I don&#x27;t use rollers (which the dome isn&#x27;t big enough for anyway) it comfortably fits my whole head. There are only holes in the top of the dryer, but there is a piece that completes the dome and directs heat around the rest of your head. the dryer gets hot enough so that it isn&#x27;t really an issue if you wrap your hair and sit all the way under the dryer.&lt;br /&gt;Burnt Smell - I noticed the slight burnt smell when first turning on the dryer. Didn&#x27;t last long. I turn on my dryer to let it heat up, go wash my hair real quick, then get under. I don&#x27;t smell the smell any time after that.&lt;br /&gt;Size - As mentioned before, this is seemingly made for your head only. Maybe if you had small rollers, you could fit, but definitely not large rollers.&lt;br /&gt;Heat - Gets pretty hot. I rolled my head around a little bit to let the heat off my ears and neck. I sat under the dryer for 45-50 minutes and my hair was thoroughly dry. (That&#x27;s about how long I sit under at the hair dresser so it&#x27;s no better or worse, really)</li>
            <li> I just received my hairdryer! I love when boxes are waiting for me when I get home from work. Anywhos, I haven&#x27;t used it yet but I was anxious to see the size of the hood. I almost chose another more expensive option because of the negative reviews about the hood being too small for your head and rollers. Well, I am glad I didn&#x27;t miss out on this deal. The hood is huge! It is plenty the size of one you would find in a salon. Believe me when I say I do not have a little head and I will have plenty of space for rollers and all my hair. Don&#x27;t believe the watermelon head haters!!! I will update with performance after my next wash day.</li>
            <li> I purchased two dryers at the same time.  One for me and the other for my daughter.  We love them!! The dryer heats very well and I love the easy store option.  I keep mine under the bed.  The dryers alo arrived two days earlier than expected. I recommend!!!</li>
            <li> I purchased this after my handheld hair dryer broke.  I&#x27;ve used it for a few weeks now and so far so good!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The dryer is easy to set up, and heats very well.  I don&#x27;t sit under it with rollers or anything, just with my hair down after washing it.  As such I do have to move my head around a bit to distribute the heat/air evenly, but it is much less work than my old hand dryer and dries much faster.  I can dry my long, curly, thick hair in about 20 minutes.  It&#x27;s so easy to fold back up and store this dryer as well, which keeps it out of the way when I am not using it.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this hair dryer. It was bigger than some reviews said. i have a pretty big head and thick hair and i had no trouble drying my hair. its durable and i love jow it folds down and has a place to tuck the cord in.</li>
            <li> My wife loves it at says that it works perfectly!</li>
            <li> I would give it 5 stars but it takes over an hour for my hair to be completely dry with rollers. My hair reaches a little above my waist.  But it is a very powerful hair dryer and very easy to carry. Doesn&#x27;t take too much space and has very hot air.</li>
            <li> I got the dryer; it was working fine. Using a 2500watt transformer; now it just dont work no more. what should i do.</li>
            <li> I purchased this dryer because my original one broke. I&#x27;d gone to several local stores and the prices were just insane. They were trying to charge upwards of $60+. I took a chance and purchased this through Amazon warehouse deal for $20. Best $20 I&#x27;ve spent in a long time. The dryer gets very hot which I love because I don&#x27;t have to spend an eternity under it. It should be noted that I&#x27;m African American and I have very thick hair. I was looking for something that would dry my hair quickly and this definitely does the job.</li>
            <li> Its great for getting the most outta looking good.  I roll only part of my hair, then grab a good book and sit and read til&#x27; I feel the heat.  I get two things done at one time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Works Excellent!  I use it every 3 days or so!</li>
            <li> Great heat!!!  Bought it for my hairstylist to use at home and it is just perfect.  It helps my hair color work faster than at the salon!</li>
            <li> its ok not what I thought it would be.</li>
            <li> I use this dryer for all of my hairstyles except my wash n gos. My daughters use to hate sitting under the dryer but they love to sit under this dryer.</li>
            <li> Love the power and heat of the item and it&#x27;s very light weight. Couldn&#x27;t have been happier with the item</li>
            <li> Broke way too quick, The bonnet part won&#x27;t stay up anymore. Just a really weird part of the dryer to break down</li>
            <li> For the price this can&#x27;t be beat. With winter I wasn&#x27;t crazy about leaving the house half diffused. If I have the time, I like to diffuse the ends of my hair to bump up the wave and then sit under this with my coffee and read the internet. I&#x27;ve discovered I can also prop the bottom of the extension a tad and get it to blow on the back of my head so I&#x27;m not always cooking the top. I love that you can have the hood up or down. It&#x27;s not horribly noisy (IMO). The two heat settings aren&#x27;t terribly different. It might be too hot for really delicate hair but overall works great for the price.</li>
            <li> My hair dryer was shipped in no time.  Brand new out the box.  Easy to operate.  Heats pretty quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this one. My local beauty supply stores didn&#x27;t have any dryers priced within my budget.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I never thought to purchase one online via amazon.com, glad I did.</li>
            <li> I read reviews that said that this dryer didn&#x27;t dry the sides and back of your head, but this was not a problem for me.  I just tilted my head a little to get the air on my sides.  I live in a small NYC apartment and love that it folds down for storage.  I had a hooded dryer before that was not collapsible and found that this one works just as well.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve never ordered this type of dryer before..and I thought the collapsible was a great idea. But 1st time using it was horrible.  I noticed a distinct odor blowing at first it smelled like it was burning....but then something else no idea what it was it wasn&#x27;t 2 minutes when I had problems breathing, chest pain when attempted to breathe and burning eyes. Once I turned it off and the air cleared the problem stopped. I don&#x27;t know what that problem was all about but it should be on recall. I ended up having to return it. I couldn&#x27;t understand conair is a good brand. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this particular dryer to anyone.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, easy to put away, nice hot air, dries my hair fast.It&#x27;s well made and the price is fantastic. I have always had a bonnet hair dryer and I feel this one will last for the next 10 to 15 years. I recommment it. No shipping charges and it arrive in just a few days. Thanks Amazon. Ms. XM Tampa FL</li>
            <li> First of all, the unit is tippy. If you can open it at all. This particular one required muscles of steel to try to yank it upward. It wouldn&#x27;t budge, then, reluctantly, edged up a little, then, pull, a little more, and, pull, a little more. Not worth the trouble each time, and I was afraid to argue with it, as it&#x27;s cheaply made and might break. And it didn&#x27;t feel particularly good to have the dryer then collapse on my head, after the latch wouldn&#x27;t work. Well, it is called a &amp;#34;Collapsible Dryer&amp;#34;! Oh, and it blew a fuse. &#x27;Nuf said. I sent it back.</li>
            <li> I can read, do my nails, etc. and my hair is ready to go.  It&#x27;s comfortable and light  and easy to store.</li>
            <li> This dryer does heat up very well, however, the hood of the dryer seems very complicated. It doesn&#x27;t lock in place and sometimes the neck of the dryer slides down as well. I wish I would&#x27;ve spent a little more money and bought a different dryer.</li>
            <li> This conair HH400 collapsable bonnet 1875-watt hair dryer is great i gave it a 100% rating because it&#x27;s very comfortable and i will be purchasing another for my neighbor.</li>
            <li> This bonnet hair dryer is great. It is light weight and really dries the hair. I would recommend it highly.</li>
            <li> I am happy with my purchase and feel that it is a great product for the money. The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because the side knobs came off easily and one completely broke off so now it won&#x27;t lock completely down for storage. However, it has been a great product to use and I am happy with it for the money spent on it.</li>
            <li> This product arrived in great condition and I am pleased to say it lives up to my expectations. The only thing is, it has the collapsible hood an I am having a difficult time making it NOT collapse! But all in all, I think it is just an adjustment period between me an the dryer an I have to get used to it.</li>
            <li> I like the most that it is easy to store.  Also it is pretty quiet.  Not as heavy as other hair dryers</li>
            <li> This hair dryer does the job, it dries my hair all around. However, it is very noisy! you can barely hear your surroundings. The motor needs to be reconstructed. As far as drying your hair it does a great job!</li>
            <li> It is hard to set up and it does not come down enough to dry all of your hair.would not recommend.</li>
            <li> Does not fit over jumbo rollers. Difficult to extend hood to full height.</li>
            <li> i was looking for this for my girlfriend, and i found, it was the perfect gift. for sure i will keep looking for more items here.</li>
            <li> Collapses very easily.  Shipped it back the very next day.</li>
            <li> its very loud sounds like a vacuum</li>
            <li> Im not in love with it but it works alright. :) ive only used it once so I shall seer what more this thing has to offer.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for one of my elderly friends.  She just loves it!  Just roll your hair and sit under the helmet while working puzzles or reading!  It was a tad difficult to set up at first.  The instructions are pretty small in type.  After figuring it all out it is exactly what she wanted.  And to be honest, I am glad she has it now because this is much easier than me standing and curling her hair with a curling iron.  I would recommend this product again in a heartbeat.</li>
            <li> If you have a sensitive scalp and most dryers are too hot for you, give this one a try.  I usually have to use the lowest temp on any hair dryer but it takes forever to dry my long, thick, curly hair.  This one dries my hair quickly and it is not too hot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside would be the side clips that hold it in place- they don&#x27;t stay put but for this price and the results, I would recommend it and buy it again.</li>
            <li> This Dryer does get just as hot as one might hope.. maybe a little to hot on the hottest setting for some. I have had my dryer for a whole now. On one side the knob has broken off I had to glue it back. Sometimes it has a gap in the back because of how dryer folds down to close, but it&#x27;s an easy fix.  The one thing I do like about this dryer is how it takes up minimal space after closing</li>
            <li> This dryer meets my natural 4B hair needs.  It gives out hot air to set my curls. Also its easy to pack away.</li>
            <li> This product folds and stores nicely and is the right size for jumbo curlers, heats evenly and high heat dries my thick hair under 25 minutes.</li>
            <li> This dryer isn&#x27;t great but it gets the job done.  Because of compact design, all the holes blowing the air are on the top of the hood and there are none on the side.      My hair is about shoulder length and the dryer gets most of if, but the part past my chin doesn&#x27;t get as much air so doesn&#x27;t dry at the same rate os the rest of my hair.      I do like the design and judging by the way it dries the top of my head, I think if I had rollers on or shorter hair this would be fine.  I am willing to live with the design since it takes up a lot less room to store compared to a conventional hooded dryer.</li>
            <li> I am african american and I use this dryer once a week for my wraps and roller sets. It doesn&#x27;t have the holes on the sides but it&#x27;s not a big deal. It is a little loud but I check email and study while I&#x27;m under the dryer, so it blocks out any household noise enabling me to concentrate without interruptions. I&#x27;ve never owned one before but it seems like it gets hot enough like the salon dryers. Ive had it for probably about a year and it&#x27;s holding up well. I love that it easily folds up and stores in my bathroom closet on the shelf. Excellent product!</li>
            <li> I didnt purchase this item from Amazon, but the one I have is the exact same hooded dryer. This product is perfect for my needs. I mainly wanted a hooded dryer for deep conditioning my natural hair (3c/4a), but large enough to accommadate rollers if I chose to utilize it for drying. I havent used it with rollers yet, but I believe it is spacious enough to fit at least medium sized rollers (I have a big head). The adjustable height made it so I have a perfect fit if Im using my computer chair, and I have no problems getting air flow to all of my hair if I lean my head down slightly (which was natural for me since I use my phone or read a book during this time). I only use the low heat setting (quieter than expected) which is sufficient enough for deep conditioning (in my opinion), and doesnt scold your skin. I took a star away because the plastic that creates the actual hood is quite thin so Im sure if someone isnt careful it could crack/break easily, and the portion that connects the hood to the base doesnt snap to hold it in place (I havent had issues with it folding back, but I wouldve liked the extra measure to ensure it wouldnt). All in all I am happy with my purchase so long as itll last at least a year and a half Ill have no qualms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. Id suggest to turn the hooded dryer on low for 30min for the first run just to get rid of the hot plastic smell, before using it. Just so its out of the way and you dont have to endure it. To clarify even further it only has that smell the very FIRST time its used.</li>
            <li> Works pretty good but, because of all the weight on the front, makes the neck very weak. Now I have to hold it up while I dry my hair. Next time I will get a bonnet head dryer.</li>
            <li> This dryer is ideal for the very short crop cuts. I just got my hair cut very short . A african american hair wash and set would coast me 50 dollar every time I went to the salon. I love my hairdresser but I must be able to save some kind of money .So I took my chances on buying the dryer even though the reviews were less than kind to the product. I am so glad I brought it. It dryers the entire dome of my head and mind you when we set are hair it not just water and air to dry.No no no... it is set with heavy gel to lay it down , wrap with tissue wrapped stripped to hold my hair in place for drying and then sit under the dry for a grand total of 20 minutes tops. LOVE IT! So ladies please keep in mine all reviews do not apply to all. If you have short hair and your looking for a dryer that distributes an even flow of air.This is the best dryer around.</li>
            <li> this is the first hair dryer I&#x27;ve ever purchased online. I must say it works perfectly and was a great gift. will be on the look out for more items from this seller.</li>
            <li> This hair dryer bonnet is a joke. It does not look like the one on the box nor the picture.  There is a huge gap because the 2 side of the bonnet do not lock together; therefore, much of the hot hair escape. waste of money</li>
            <li> Works great, but loud</li>
            <li> this hair dryer is great.  I had an old hooded type and it was lost in a fire. I ordered this one after reaading alot of reviews. Couldn&#x27;t be happier. Not that noisy, heats quickly, the size of the hood is big. I would recemond this hair dryer to any one that wants a compact, good hair dryer..</li>
            <li> I plugged it in and it wont come on at all. Not working and I really wanted this type of dryer</li>
            <li> I rather enjoyed my dryer. It is big, easy to put together and not much noisier than any salon types. The fold-away feature is a life saver for those with young children and for space proposes</li>
            <li> I got this hair dryer to dry my hair and it works and does what is it suppose to do-- dry my hair.  I agree with some of the comments about the dryer not drying the back of a person&#x27;s head.  That is true.  I also found the bonnet to be very small.  It I had rollers in my hair my head would not fit under it.</li>
            <li> After looking for months online and in store, my search was finally over.  This was a great buy. The price was amazing.  The dryer dries my entire head and doesn&#x27;t get too hot to the point that it would burn. I just wish the cord was a little longer.  It works great and I would definitely recommend to anyone who is looking for a hair dryer.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my naturally curly hair as a way to beat my curly hair frizz. While it does the top of my head nicely, the bottom half stays wet, even after 45 minutes. I have shoulder length hair, so it is not super-long. Kind of disapppinting. I will opt for a better shape next time.     I imagine this is a great drier for someone using curlers, though</li>
            <li> I bought this hair dryer for my wife because she was always borrowing our neighbors. Well since she started using it, she&#x27;s very happy that it works so well. It has plenty of blowing power, heat for drying, and height adjustments. Now the neighbor comes over to use it and now I have two HOT HEADED women in the house. SHE LOVES IT!     http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E8VI9U/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_rev_prod_title[[ASIN:B000E8VI9U   Conair HH400 Collapsable Bonnet 1875-Watt Hair Dryer, White]]</li>
            <li> I love to wrap my hair and seat under the dryer my hair dry&#x27;s quickly and it good for doing deep conditioning</li>
            <li> A good dryer. Have not figured  out to close.dries your hair really good. Opened easily. Would recommend to any one.</li>
            <li> This really helped my hair look better than air-drying, and it was really inexpensive. Everyone need to get one of these if they are putting rollers in their hair.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed once I received the item.  Some of the reviews gave it high marks which I cannot understand.  It is poorly constructed and the air vents only cover the top half of your head.  I used it once and it was hurting my hearing so I couldn&#x27;t finish using it.  It truly sounds like a small propelled airplane is right next to you.</li>
            <li> Very, very nice product. This unit is so well designed and packs away so well for transport or storage, I find it truly refreshing to buy such a well engineered product.  Works really well for setting my 84 yr old Mom&#x27;s hair, (old style curlers and the works!)  Only two issues I can find that I would change, given the option; 1.) it is very loud on the high fan speed/heat setting, 2.) Both high and low fan speeds are hot, there is no cool setting available.</li>
            <li> i love it even thou other my not i love it it work just perfect for me i dont do roller so i guess i wanted it more for deep condtion and it did have a funny smell at first but it is because its new so its burnig it out but it it works great for me and the truth is you get what you pay for its not high end but it dose the job i only paid 30 bucks so it was worth it for that price</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t even know they still sold these, so I started on ebay.  Prices started at around $30 and would take 7-10 days to get to us.  I checked Amazon and for $5 less, I could get it with prime in 2 days.  Won on both counts!  Not crazy about how the cord winds up - gets in the way, but dryer works great - runs 30 minutes a night to dry kids hair before bed.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews before purchasing this item. I&#x27;m very glad I did... fits perfect with big rollers, dries hair evenly and quick. Not too hot and very comfortable. I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Loved it! I bought this item used, it was regularly $29, I got it on Amazon for $14. Once I ordered my other items they totaled $25 so I recieved free shipping. I expected it to look used, but to my amazement it was spotless. I still just wiped it down for own peace of mind, but I really did not have to. Turned it on, it worked like a champ. I have had it almost a month now, no problems. I read a lot of bad reviews about this particular dryer , but it works fine for me. I really like it because my hair did not take very long to dry and I was able to dry my hair on the low setting, and I have very thick hair. The only thing I found funny is that it looks like a dryer once it is let out, but once it is let down it looks like a space ship. Ha ha! Seriously I would definitely recommend this item.</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical when I purchased the dryer because not all the reviews were good.  It was delivered so quickly after I purchased it that I could not believe it.  I quickly unpacked it and tried out and I have to say that it will dry your hair evenly.  The two settings are great and it is a powerful dryer.  I love it!</li>
            <li> Easy to operate, easy to carry. Many adjustable heights. Low and high setting. I&#x27;m glad to finally have one and for a reasonable price!</li>
            <li> The dryer works perfectly it does exactly what I needed it to do, it&#x27;s compact and light weight. It is loud but it&#x27;s not unbearable</li>
            <li> My wife truly enjoy the dryer.</li>
            <li> The dryer works well,  it is just a little tricky opening and closing.  Otherwise it gets the job done!</li>
            <li> Bonnet handles broke within 2 months of hvn</li>
            <li> It may work well if you have short hair. The 3 height positions need the hair dryer to be on top of either a table, a desk or something like to work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had it for 4 months and it seems to be becoming noisier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It sure is better than a normal blow dryer because you do not have to keep holding it, but next time I&#x27;ll get the real thing, that stands on its on and actually dries all of the hair without you having to lower your head to dry it at the back.</li>
            <li> Bought it for a friend, it wasn&#x27;t as strong as she wanted, but others could use it. Bought a replacement whig worked out fine.</li>
            <li> It is niot that great</li>
            <li> Decided to but this dryer after my other dryer finally  said it had enough. I like the fact that it is collapsable because it fits over the bed and out the way but i don&#x27;t like that the vent holes are only on top. You will have to move your head around to get the sides and back. With this dryer it took about 2 hour for my apl natural 4a hair to dry. Guess you can&#x27;t beat it for the price.</li>
            <li> I purchased this dryer for me and my two young daughters ( I do their hair myself). I usually wash and style wet. Needed this dryer for the approaching winter weather. Can&#x27;t let them go outside with wet hair.&lt;br /&gt;This dryer does not only have two great heat settings but it&#x27;s height adjustable and easy to store. Great purchase</li>
            <li> Worked great! Wife is very happy with it</li>
            <li> It was just as i expected it to be for my usage. I couldn&#x27;t have got a better one then this</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand why anyone would like this product. It&#x27;s awful!  The bonnet is small beyond comprehension, it would work only if you had a flat head. NOTHING fits under this dryer, it&#x27;s so shallow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also tripped my circuit breaker after only 5 minutes on the LOW setting, so I can only assume it&#x27;s so powerful and yet so poorly designed at the same time that if it had stayed on it would have FRIED the hair on the very top of my head while leaving the rest of my hair wet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m just sorry I threw all the packaging out (I got it delivered to my office ad didn&#x27;t want to carry the big box home) because I would definitely have returned it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This dryer is a total waste of money.  DO NOT BUY IT!!!!!</li>
            <li> Every woman on the go needs to have this dryer.  For me, it worked out great.  If you are a natural hair girl, then you will understand where I am coming from.  Our hair tends to take forever to dry and with this little dryer, it makes the process 10x faster.  Will I buy this again?  Absolutely!!!</li>
            <li> This is one of the BEST dryers I&#x27;ve had.  It does not take up a lot of room and it&#x27;s quiet.  Love it, and would recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> When I received the hair dryer, the part that you flip underneath was broken!! I knew that it could not have been my fault because as soon as I took it out of the box, a plastic piece fell and I saw the damage. I think that I wasted my money on this product and I could have bought something better. I also agree with review number one, it does not have enough hair hole to dry the front or \\&quot;edges\\&quot; of my head. Overall this is a satisfactory product but I would not recommend this to everyone.</li>
            <li> I have natural wavy fine hair.  No matter what I do, the hairdo doesn&#x27;t last more than a day. I tried blow drying with a diffuser, which does OK.  Most of the time I air dry my hair.  I bought this dryer so I can wash my hair more often and forego the air drying.  It takes about 15 minutes under this dryer rather than an hour of&lt;br /&gt;air drying, and haphazard results with the diffuser.</li>
            <li> I ended up returning this product. My problem with this product is that it did not dry the back of my hair....it was super annoying. But glad Amazon took it back w/o any hassle. I really don&#x27;t recommend it at all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this hair bonnet once since purchasing it.  I am very satisfied with my purchase.  It dries my hair fast, fyi I did not have to turn around in my chair to dry the sides or the back and the design makes its neck adjustable it can stretch out pretty tall.  I love how compact the design is as well for storage purposes. I have no complaints yet.</li>
            <li> it  is ok does the job i realy cannot say much more about it. The angle that it comes down could be improved. making it more&lt;br /&gt;comfortable</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s lightweight, portable and easy to assemble.  Works like a charm.  Professional results. I love it! I definitely reccomend it.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my grandmother who had a very old school version of this and it had finally torn up... this was a nice upgrade/ replacement.  She likes it - just said it gets a lot hotter than her old one... guess that can be a good thing though..</li>
            <li> Great for me because it takes soooo long to dry my thick long hair with a hand held blow dryer. This sits right on the kitchen table or any table top and extends to the height you need it. Folds easily and stores easy. love it for the price</li>
            <li> It is easy to use and dries fast. I love this dryer. I&#x27;m glad my old one stopped working. Great price.</li>
            <li> This hair dryer replaced my old one of five years or more. It will not disappoint for the price and it dries my hair within an hour.</li>
            <li> This hair dryer works as well as any in a salon! The best part is its used in the privacy of your home! It&#x27;s quiet, fits on any table &amp; the results are amazing!</li>
            <li> I decided to purchase the Conair HH400 due to the price, and lack of other options, as a replacement for a hair dryer that I have had for years.  Aside from the hood being too short, the dryer being too loud and the limited heat settings (high and low),this dryer has been overheating and the plug is almost completely melted. Since I used a different dryer with the same wattage for years without a problem, I have to believe that the dryer is the issue.  I purchased this dryer in July 2012 and now, three months later, I have to purchase a new dryer.  Apparently, I only had a month to return this dryer to Amazon, according to their return policy for this item.  I DO NOT recommend this item.</li>
            <li> Kind of awkward to close but overall a good hairdryer.</li>
            <li> This product is great.  However, it came with one of the clasp broken.  Still usable and does just want i need.</li>
            <li> Like this alot. As others stated it is roomy enough for very large rollers. Heat settings and air flow are good also easy to fold and store.</li>
            <li> It works great, it&#x27;s just really loud &amp; has a ringing noise while running. If you can tune out the noise it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li> Had to return this-Amazon return process is EZ!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, as a few others stated, the bonnet doesnt line up for a secure snap on fit. Get another model, spend a little more money</li>
            <li> It functions well, but its a little loud and the bonnet is a little too shallow. But it&#x27;s the best one available unless you want one that stands on a pedistal and occupies more storage space. This dryer is very easy to transport and store.</li>
            <li> I bought this hair dryer because it was the cheapest (with the highest star reviews for the price) and has the option for free shipping.  I read all the reviews first and determined that it would give me the best bang for my buck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With that said, there are a few issues which other reviewers have addressed:&lt;br /&gt;1.  The top gets very, very hot and the distribution of heat throughout the entire hood is uneven.&lt;br /&gt;2.  Included in #1, the back and sides do not have sufficient holes for the heat to escape the dryer.&lt;br /&gt;3.  The dryer on high is really loud, I usually watch TV while sitting under the dryer and I cant hear the TV, its that loud.  On low, the sound of the dryer is bearable, but the entire dryer doesn&#x27;t get warm enough to really get the heat going.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it does the job it supposed to.  It comes down to this: Buy this if you are on a budget, if you are NOT a hair dresser, and you plan to use this once a week for simple deep conditioning with a shower cap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t buy this if you want a high quality dryer, if you&#x27;re a hair dresser (or aspiring to be, if you plan to use a hooded dryer on a daily basis - you&#x27;ll get frustrated trying to dry your hair evenly everyday.</li>
            <li> The conair hair dryer met my needs for a portable hair dryer.  The only feature that could be improved is the noise that comes from the motor while the dryer is running.</li>
            <li> Purchased for my daughter.  She uses it on her clients and herself.  Loves it because its portable and she can carry it wherever she goes.  If she&#x27;s happy then I&#x27;m happy.</li>
            <li> i know that some do offer that option . that would make this hair dryer perfect .. butit gives good heat and seems to dry quicker than when im at the shop so thats good enough for me</li>
            <li> Although it was probably effective, I&#x27;d gotten it for my octogenarian mother.  It was too much to handle and too complicated to fold up and put away.  I returned it.</li>
            <li> this dryer is fabulous.  it is so easy to set up and take down and store.  the bonnet has an extension that flips down and makes a great cover for the rolled hair and dries it so fast.  i am done in about 15-20 minutes with medium length hair.  great value.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased to get my hair dryer; it does a great job; I wish it had more settings.</li>
            <li> this is a great hair dryer for the price, my hair is short and my hair is dry within 20 to 30 minutes. I will be ordering another one just in case this one blows out as much as i use it. Great product.</li>
            <li> Wife says it works great and when Momma is happy all in the home is happy including the doggie, and hubby too !</li>
            <li> Not used very often but it dries evenly and was told it was very effective.  Bought this for step-mom and she uses it every month.  Not a heavy duty unit but great for occasional use or if you do not convert the unit everytime back to mobile condition. Recommended.</li>
            <li> Great price sturdy product.</li>
            <li> This dryer works great.  I borrowed one from my mom, who borrowed it from my aunt.  After using it just once on my daughter I had to get my own.  I&#x27;ve since used it on myself and it works like it should.  At least for me anyway.  I am naturally curly so on days when I don&#x27;t want to &amp;#34;wash-n-go&amp;#34; I use this or a handheld with diffuser.</li>
            <li> I had a hair bonnet the would dry my long hair in 45 mins. I used this one for two hours and my hair close to my neck was still humid. It does not circulate as well as I would like.</li>
            <li> I have been using Conair for a very long time.  This bonnet is perfect, the storage is so much easier and it is very light.  The only fault I find is the bottom of my hair does not get dry.  I can live with that, most dryers will not dry long curly hair.</li>
            <li> Works great!!! It&#x27;s noisy though but I normally listen music or watch a movie while I&#x27;m drying my hair so it just bothers others around me :).</li>
            <li> It does the job.  I love and use it when putting my hair in curlers while trying to multi-task.  I would recommend</li>
            <li> Good dryer. Easy storage .</li>
            <li> Works great. Very effective, even at the low setting. Sturdy on any surface. Love it. A little loud on high but I don&#x27;t need it that hot anyway.</li>
            <li> I am using my hood dryer for the 3rd time as I&#x27;m writing this review and I have to say this is one of the best purchases I&#x27;ve made for my hair in awhile. I am a black woman with medium length natural hair. My hair is on the medium-thin side. I usually twist my hair and let it air dry but this dryer has allowed me to diversify my style arsenal. Currently, I am doing two-strand twists with flexirods. The dryer has reduced drying time from all day (with air drying) to about 1 - 1hr depending on the size of the twists. I could not be happier!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was a bit underwhelmed when I opened the box but luckily the dryer has proved me wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The heat of the dyer is enough to dry your hair but not hot enough to burn the skin on the back of your neck (like professional salon dryers)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The design of the dryer is compact and collapsible which is great for storage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The adjustable height has lot of different settings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few reviews complained about the back and sides of their hair not drying as fast as the top. I&#x27;ve been able to work around this by a. moving my head (of course) and lowering the hood and holding my head down to dry the back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, this is a fantasic dryer at this price point.</li>
            <li> It dries hair pretty fast, but the noise deafening.  It is like a constant shrill scream, soccer match whistle kind of noise. Wear ear plugs!</li>
            <li> The hair dryer was a great price. However, the fumes that came from it when I attempted to use it almost knocked me out. I never could use this product. I will not purchase another one</li>
            <li> It is an OK dryer, but must put it on high for a quick dry. Will be too small for huge rollers.</li>
            <li> I have mine for 3 years and it does the job but it very loud. It also broke but it still works and I still use it because I&#x27;m still searching for a good hair dryer.</li>
            <li> When set for &amp;#34;hot&amp;#34; the cord gets very hot and am afraid it will start an electrical fire. Will use for five to ten minutes, let it cool off then start again.</li>
            <li> I use it to heat up curlers on damp hair and I use it to develop foil highlights at home! Makes my life so much easier with three daughters!</li>
            <li> The product arrived on time and functioned as expected.  The difficulty is that it&#x27;s difficult for an elderly person to fold up and store.  My Mom is 90 and her old bonnet dryer didn&#x27;t work so I purchased this one.  I could assemble it and disassemble it pretty easy, but it was too much for her.  So what I decided to do was find a location and leave it set up so all she needed to do was put her head under it and turn it on.</li>
            <li> I use with rollers and I use for deep conditioning my hair. It gets the job done. I only use low setting because it gets pretty warm! It seems to take about 1hr to dry hair in rollers, but I&#x27;m usually reading, doing homework, or my nails while I wait so not a big deal.</li>
            <li> The second time I turned it on, it fizzled off after about 5 minutes, on the low setting. I returned it to Conair ($20 for shipping) for repair. I don&#x27;t see from the comments here that this is a common problem, so perhaps just my bad luck. I&#x27;ll update the review when I see how Conair does in honoring the (1 year limited) warranty. So far, one of the worst $50 I&#x27;ve spent (original cost plus shipping cost to Conair for repair. Yet another reminder just to go for quality, next time. You end up spending the same amount in the end--might as well get something reliable that lasts. Sigh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I got a replacement (or repaired) dryer back in the mail. This one works fine. The sides and very back of my hair dry last while the top of my head gets pretty hot. Which would have been fine for a $30 dryer. Not so thrilled that it&#x27;s now a $50 dryer. Hope this one doesn&#x27;t break! But adding back a star for restored functionality.</li>
            <li> I love that it collapses for better storage and there are several height adjustments. Only problem is I haven&#x27;t figured out how to wind the cord into the bottom. I don&#x27;t know if it is broken or if I am doing it wrong.</li>
            <li> I am a natural African-American woman and I have been looking for a dryer for the sole purpose of deep conditioning my hair. This is a perfect affordable dryer for this. It&#x27;s easy to adjust according to your height, it drys all parts of your hair, and it easy to store away.  I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I love this hair dryer because it can actually dry a short woman&#x27;s hair. I am 5 feet and had a different hair dryer that didn&#x27;t go low enough for shorter individuals; my hair would barely dry so i decided to get this dryer. This dryer actually goes lower than i thought and it dries my hair pretty quick. I have curly Hispanic hair and it takes about 35-40 minutes to dry.</li>
            <li> This is the best home hair dryer I&#x27;ve ever used. I use it every week or as often as I do my hair.  Wonderful home hair Dryer can&#x27;t say enough about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;W</li>
            <li> Well worth the money. VERY SATISFIED. After reading some of the reviews, wasn&#x27;t sure but so very happy with the product.</li>
            <li> it does work the dryer gets really hot and you don&#x27;t have to sit under it too long .</li>
            <li> Takes awhile to get the hang of it.  Once I adjusted the height and my sitting position, it completely dried my hair in 20 minutes.  I use a bonnet dryer instead of air drying or diffusing my curly hair.  But be warned this dryer is extremely loud and high pitched.  But that is a small inconvienence to get a dryer that works well.  It collapses flat for easy storage and travel (via car).  I have spent a lot more on dryers trying to find a replacement for my Lady Schick that I received as a high school graduation gift in 1976 (held together with duct tape and bungee cords), and this dryer comes closest in power and drying capacity.</li>
            <li> Great appliance and it works well!</li>
            <li> This has allowed me to both deep condition and style my hair at home.  This has helped me save time and money</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this once to deep condition my hair and all i can say is so far, so good. 5 stars.</li>
            <li> Nice hair dryer that I only use when I deep conditioner my daughter and my hair. I really try to avoid heat but to deep conditioner I figure this is fine. At least until I break down and purchase a steamer. I say it serves the purpose I purchased it for and it wasn&#x27;t that expensive.</li>
            <li> I bought thus dryer because the space saver design and it it were not because the noisy drive my husband nuts and let me partially deaf, I would give a 5 star.</li>
            <li> I am not impressed. First off this is the loudest dryer I&#x27;ve ever encountered. There doesn&#x27;t seem to be enough air circulating around to dry the hair appropriately, so even though my hair is short, it takes forever to dry. I seems to me as though the entire unit itself is very flimsily made. I also find it difficult to fold down. If I could get it to fold down the way it was supposed to, it would be great. But it doesn&#x27;t really do so very easily. And because I don&#x27;t trust the construction, I&#x27;m afraid to fiddle with it too much. Also, it&#x27;s difficult to adjust the the height. I had to settle for slightly higher than ideal. I&#x27;m glad I don&#x27;t use it with rollers. But just to dry my 3c, but short, hair. I&#x27;m pretty sure this will die in about a year, maybe two. When that happens I&#x27;ll go down to my local beauty supply store and get one there. Disappointing!</li>
            <li> than any other one that I have found, and it is very sturdy so I liked that about it the best.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely no where near salon quality and not always worth the hassle of pulling it out to use it. It does help save time when I don&#x27;t have time to go make an appointment for deep conditioning.</li>
            <li> ....but I LOVE me some amazon so I&#x27;m gonna review it here. It seems to dry at a fast rate. It doesn&#x27;t really dry the back of my head but I don&#x27;t like to hold my head down cuz it&#x27;s murder on my neck. Money well spent nonetheless. Quality dryer (if cared for properly) and affordable price!</li>
            <li> The Conair HH400 Collapsable Bonnet 1875-Watt Hair Dryer  is great!  Its condition is good, and very helpful when I use it daily to dry my hair .  Thank you.</li>
            <li> Product works but the amount of noise emanating from the motor gave indication that something might be wrong with it. Could be a factory fault.</li>
            <li> It gets the job done. I was a little weary at first knowing that heat only comes from the top and not the sides, but if you let the dryer heat up for about 15 prior to use, it will work just fine. Very convenient and easy to store.</li>
            <li> I wish I purchased this ages ago. I get up, take my shower, velcro roller my hair, and sit under the dryer while checking my email and sipping my coffee. Before ya know it, I&#x27;m out the door and off to work. No more time consuming, by blow drying my hair and holding a curling iron.</li>
            <li> I bought for my stepmother and she told me its work ex. cellent.the right watt she has fine hair and hair get dry fast</li>
            <li> This dryer was more than moneys worth. It works very well, it dries my hair very fast and it is so convenient to store and travel with. It is also very economical.</li>
            <li> This dryer is really hot and it works really good. I have to use a deep conditioner on my hair because my lupus is pulling it out. My sister has used it already. It gives out great heat and so light weight. I since my  lupus is in my joints so it is not heavy on my hand. I would recommended this ConairHH400 hair dryer for sure.</li>
            <li> Got this for my mother, she is still using it.  But be careful, the bonnett tends to not latch good and will fall on your head.</li>
            <li> I Love Love Love this dryer!!!!!! Very light weight and you dont feel like your head has a large helmet on it!.....lol</li>
            <li> I purchased this dryer to test whether it would distribute heat evenly to dry the back of my head.  It failed that test, but it did dry the rest of my hair very well on the high setting, which was very hot, and had to be turned back to low after about 10 minutes.  Also, the sound is very loud at the high setting.</li>
            <li> hi - unfortunately it is not compatible with our power source and will need a convertor-stepdown transformer for it to work -which is very expensive- so Im wondering why you send them to australia if this is the case-was going to send back but it was going to cost $100 Aust. Dont know if you have any thoughts on how to solve this problem??- thanks Michelle</li>
            <li> These are becoming extinct. Very hard to find especially for the older gals.  Since I cannot stand for hours blow drying I needed&lt;br /&gt;a bonnet hairdryer and found one at Amazon.  Very pleased with it light weight but only has 2 speeds high and low.  My only&lt;br /&gt;problem with this is; it does NOT have drying vents on the drying stand to dry the hair curlers around your neck. You have to&lt;br /&gt;keep turning your head and stretching up to reach the bottom curlers.</li>
            <li> I dont really have a place I can put this.  It is a pain to set up and use, it is not even worth it.  So I dont even know if this works properly because I have nowhere to put it and use it</li>
            <li> BUILT CHEAPLY AND WOULD NOT RECOMMEND!  HARD TO OPEN AND FOLD UP!  UNCOMFORTABLE TO SIT UNDER BECAUSE OF IT&#x27;S SIZE(HAVE TO BE REAL CREATIVE) - WOULD RECOMMEND LOOKING FOR A BETTER DRYER!</li>
            <li> I really like this product so far. The only thing I didn&#x27;t like about it was that when I first turned it on, there was a burning-like odor that emitted from it. That smell quickly went away after about 3 minutes of having it on. I was scared that it was going to catch on fire. . . .I&#x27;m actually using it right now as I write this review. I think people are being overly picky about this product. It&#x27;s no louder than the dryers that you would sit under if you went into a salon. It&#x27;s a dryer, people! Even hand-held blow dryers are loud. Did you expect to listen to the Bible on tape as you sat under it or be able to hear the tv? That&#x27;s what earphones are for. As for it drying only on the top of your head, that&#x27;s not true. It really evenly distributes the heat onto your whole head unless you have a dino megahead. I was lucky enough to have a regular sized head, so it&#x27;s a perfect fit for me. I paid $27 for it, so I&#x27;m over here smiling from ear to ear. I hate that people think they should only have to pay like $5 to get the perfect machine. Even the most expensive machines don&#x27;t get the job done. If you have a lot of hair, this might take awhile to dry your hair, so plan your day ahead of time. If you have short/medium length hair like mine, it might just be right for you. Also, I have thick hair so I&#x27;ve always needed a little extra time for my hair to dry. RIght now I am deep conditioning my hair under the dryer for 30 minutes, then I&#x27;ll dry it for 45m to an hour after I wash the conditioner out. I love that it doesn&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s blowing out fire onto my head, burning my scalp and forehead like some salons&#x27; dryers feel like. ENJOY THIS PRODUCT!</li>
            <li> This dryer came fairly quickly it wasnt what I expected but it works ok. It does what it needs to do.</li>
            <li> Have not used it yet,but turned it on to check it out,seems to heat up quickly.&lt;br /&gt;And I have couple of Conair products ,so I trust the brand.</li>
            <li> I feel the product is inferior. No real support, and have to have a brick to hold it down, or it would fall over.</li>
            <li> I like this. I can fit a head full of curlers under it and the hi heat is pretty decent.&lt;br /&gt;Now if only I could get my hair pinning technique down...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This may be a downside for some, the holes from which the air comes are only on the top, not the sides.</li>
            <li> Very powerful drying and easy to set up</li>
            <li> Never adept at styling my short, fine hair with a blow dryer, I needed to use a curling iron as well. Whilendoing battle with cancer I simply didn&#x27;t have the stamina to hold my arms up. I thought sitting under this hood would be the perfect solution since there was ample room to &amp;#34;fluff &amp;#34; my hair with my fingers while it dried. And therein lies the problem --nit takes forEVER to dry my very short hair. Even after I think it&#x27;s dry, once it cools off it&#x27;s  still damp. There&#x27;s no easy way to dry the hair at the back of my neck. After contorting myself to get as much of my hair inside the hood as possible I found myself sitting backwards and looking at the floor. And this was on high speed and high heat. It is also unusually heavy. Has to be stored on a low shelf. and the only time it actually closed properly was when it fell off the table and snapped itself shut. Even then it was a struggle to stuff the cord inside. It&#x27;s a great idea gone wrong and I sure wouldn&#x27;t recommend buying it.</li>
            <li> Works very well on my relaxed African American shoulder length hair. I wet wrap my hair and am completely dry in 1 hour. This is fabulous, as I paid triple the price for another hooded dryer that took 1 and 1/2 hours to dry my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please don&#x27;t be dettered by the negative reviews, try for yourself!  The many comments about the location of the air holes are irrelevant in my opinion, as my thick hair is evenly dried without issue or excess time.  The bonnet is also definitely big enough to use with my large rollers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also love how this dryer collapses flat and can be stored under the bed or easily in a small closet.  Conair is offering a great product at a very reasonable price!</li>
            <li> Yes it&#x27;s true, it doesn&#x27;t cover the very back of your head (by your neck) but this is very roomy and spacious. I use those big rolos (Dominican) and it dries them great. It&#x27;s noisy, but sturdy and does the job. It would have been a 5 star had the shape been more of a cube to dry the back. Great price and quick shipping.</li>
            <li> The bonnet has good heat,but only 2 settings. The bonnet doesn&#x27;t come down far enough to reach the nape area of my head without the roof of the bonnet touching the top of my head, so that was disappointing. But for the price, I am satisfied.</li>
            <li> Very difficult to assemble -- finally gave up.  The materials seemed flimsy and easily breakable.  I was very disappointed with the quality.</li>
            <li> This item was ordered to replace another brand that I had used for well over 30 years.  While this unit will serve my purpose, I agree with some of the other reviewers that it could stand some improvement.  The shape and depth of the &amp;#34;bonnet&amp;#34; is not very comfortable to sit under and it is a bit noisy.</li>
            <li> This is a cheap item. But it does the job, as in it will heat up the hair to the point of dripping and you sweating. And that&#x27;s what counts.</li>
            <li> This product doesn&#x27;t work in that a person can&#x27;t get their head inside the unit where the heat comes out...very cumbersome. We bought a standing version instead and it&#x27;s much better.</li>
            <li> This has got to be the best little hair dryer I have ever seen for the non-professional hair stylist.  It is perfect for those in-between/emergency hair fixes that need to be done when you can&#x27;t make your hair salon appointment.  It has only two settings but they are more than adequate for drying the hair.  I have short hair so I don&#x27;t use any rollers, only mousse.  My drying time takes less than 30 minutes.  This dryer is compact and easy to store -- it folds to about 2-3 inches in height and the cord folds right into the side of the base.  For the price, I found it to be one of my best online purchases.</li>
            <li> I purchased this dryer at a great price on amazon. I have had it for almost a year now (writing the review late). I initially got it because I had a short hair cut and needed to set my hair. My hair is long now and I still use the dryer. I have no complaints whatsoever. I think buying this dryer was a great investment.</li>
            <li> Works well, a bit awkward, but considering the task it has to perform a good buy for the price.  If you need one, it is adequate.</li>
            <li> when it said bonnet I thought it came with a bonnet not so or atleast I didn&#x27;t get one maybe it was a mistake sure would be nice to get what I paided for I guess I will have to send my nurse to get me a bonnet at the beauty supply place kind of inconvient it does state bonnet but there is no bonnet</li>
            <li> This dryer does exactly what it is supposed to do, which is to dry your hair. It does dry the sides of the hair as well. However, this dryer is LOUD!  My daughter was drying her hair, and I honestly thought I&#x27;d be deaf after she finished using it. However, it is not as loud if you are the person under it. That&#x27;s the only bad report for this dryer. Otherwise it works pretty well. And it folds down really nicely, and could even be tucked up under your bed!</li>
            <li> The one thing I don&#x27;t like about this dryer is the holes because they are only located in the top half of the hood. The bottom &amp;#34;band&amp;#34; part of the dryer that flips around when you set it up doesn&#x27;t have any holes for air to reach the bottom of your hair near your neck. I have locs so getting them all dry, especially in the winter, is important. You have to stick your head all the way to the top so air can reach the rest of your hair; but then all you can see is the inside of the dryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dryer has two heat settings-low and high, no timer, no as noisy as other hood dryers and a very adjustable height.</li>
            <li> Like a lot of other reviews I ignored before buying this, I was a bit disappointed. The dryer works fine &amp; the heat is descent. It&#x27;s the design of the product &amp; the placement of the heat holes i don&#x27;t understand! Why would Conair think that i would only want to dry half my hair?</li>
            <li> Got it for my wife, she tried it and it gives off very little heat. I suspect a good machine would cost $100 at a minimum. Threw this one out.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend bought the dryer for my birthday last week. I did a deep conditioning for 30 mins on low heat but next time I might keep it under for an hour. I fell in love with it. It is just like the regular dryers at the salon but more comfortable because you&#x27;re at home. It&#x27;s not as noisy like the other reviewers said. I did think it take a while for your hair to dry but if you don&#x27;t have nothing to do within your day then you&#x27;re fine. I moved around in different positions while it was drying and it wasn&#x27;t too bad. Thank you sweetie for getting this for me!</li>
            <li> It is compact enough to store easily.  The noise when it&#x27;s on high power is very shrill and unpleasant.  Low power is much better.</li>
            <li> Im loving my new dryer although its not as big as it looks on the top part. I think it will get the job done for now and again for the price you cant beat it...its also kinda loud.</li>
            <li> I have very curly hair and I like to do frequent deep conditioners and hot oils. The power of this item, for it&#x27;s price and size, is amazing. It is easy to move around. I can put this on the table while I work on my laptop, i can put it on a stool while I play my video games, and i am glad that i got it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did a foam roller wrap and that worked as well. Im happy with this.</li>
            <li> I purchased this because I wanted to stop using &amp;#34;direct&amp;#34; heat on my hair (I didn&#x27;t blow dry, but I let my hair dry and I would then put on hot rollers). My hair is not very damaged but this has definitely made a difference. I usually put it up in a bun when it&#x27;s damp/wet and let it dry for about 2 hours (my hair is very thick so it takes a long time to dry...plus putting up when it&#x27;s wet also delays it) and then I go on this machine for about an hour. I know a lot of people will probably think this isn&#x27;t a good idea because it is still heat but, my hair has never been better to be honest. The heat is evenly distributed and it is not overly hot in my opinion. I have to problems with this product though (nothing really big but I still think I should mention them):&lt;br /&gt;-The noise. There&#x27;s no way around it, really. I usually just listen to some music because the noise really annoys me, but it&#x27;s bearable...just incredibly annoying.&lt;br /&gt;-The fact that big rollers don&#x27;t quite fit. I have really thick long-ish hair (about 4 or 5 inches below my bra strap) so it&#x27;s quite difficult for me to get it all in...it&#x27;s possible but, your hair will obviously be still wet in some spots so be patient! If you have short hair (say shoulder length and up) this is PERFECT. Your hair will be dried rather quickly and it will look great :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ALSO, I do hair treatments with this prior to showering. For the girls trying to grow out their hair, this is great keep your ends healthy! I put on coconut oil (or almond oil...or grape seed oil, depends on my mood haha), I coat my hair with it then I put it up and sit under this thing for about 15 minutes. I swear, it makes the difference! Your hair really absorbs the product so, this is also a great investment if you want to FULLY penetrate your hair&#x27;s cuticle.</li>
            <li> Dryer does not extend heat down to the back of the head. After heating, the side knob broke off hindges.</li>
            <li> This product is ok for the price we paid, but it is very noisy. and yes if you use the big rollers on your hair, the bottom of your hair will not get dried, I use the medium sized ones so im ok,</li>
            <li> I like the size &amp; fit of this hair dryer. It dries quickly &amp; isn&#x27;t excessively noisy. I would recommend it to any one who is looking for this style dryer.</li>
            <li> Great with fast drying time.</li>
            <li> It does everything that it&#x27;s supposed to do, I guess the only thing I&#x27;m kind of down about is that the shape is awkward enough so that sitting is also an endeavor at first.</li>
            <li> This dryer works very well and I get professional results every time I use it. It drys my hair fast and It is easy to pack away when finished.</li>
            <li> It works well for me because I am short.  If you are taller you might have to stack it on book when you put it on the table.</li>
            <li> A great low budget find, but I am challenged every time I try to close this particular dryer down, LOL!!!  And it is not a long hair dryer, maybe medium length to shorter.</li>
            <li> The hood didn&#x27;t cover and I had to slouch to sit under the dryer.</li>
            <li> Good dryer but I find it very annoying to adjust the head.  Would not recommend.</li>
            <li> Easy to use. Love it.</li>
            <li> This dryer is worthless. The cap part is attached wrong and won&#x27;t set up for use. I&#x27;d return it, but a previous review leads me to believe a refund will not be forthcoming.</li>
            <li> some concern about sturdiness</li>
            <li> Not worth buying cant get the flip to fit correctly so it has a gap in it.</li>
            <li> First of all, I absolutely love this product.  As others have said, while I used to dread the time wasted while drying my hair with a normal hair dryer, now I can get out of bed, jump in the shower, and then spend the time while my hair is drying catching up on everything on my phone that I would normally have before getting out of bed.  I don&#x27;t find it particularly noisy and since I have fairly short hair, it all dries easily by just tilting my head a bit from side to side or forward during the 5 minutes or so it takes to dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I am on my third one of these in a little over 2 years.  It seems like they last about a year before they burn out.  I can tell when it&#x27;s going to happen now because it starts to smell a little bit funny (burning) and you can see some of the plastic on the dryer base starting to bulge (I&#x27;m guessing from heat expansion of the wires).  That said, I consider $30ish to be a reasonable annual purchase but I do have a bit of a fear of fire from the dryer.</li>
            <li> I have used this hair dryer about 4 times so far and each time the sides and the hair on the nape of my neck is not just damp, but soaking wet.  Even when you adjust the hood to the lowest possible height, you will walk away with parts of your hair sloppy wet.  Pleeeeaaasse done purchase this...............</li>
            <li> The old one quit working, so we looked for a new one which resembled the old one. This one works fine.</li>
            <li> It dries the hair with rollers very well. Construction of dryer isn&#x27;t nearly as good as the ones made 30 years ago, but this is true with all products.  I like that it folds up to a smaller size so it is easier to store.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife, and we just tried it out this morning. The height is just right when it is setting on a table, and she is very happy with it.</li>
            <li> It only dry the top of head.</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast. Product was properly wrapped and delivered. New product was in fabulous condition. I am very pleased with this order and felt that the product was well worth my money.</li>
            <li> My mom loves it, she says it&#x27;s just like getting your hair dried at a salon but in the comfort of your own home</li>
            <li> We haven&#x27;t had this very long, just a few weeks, but so far me and my daughter like it. It smelled a little weird the first time we used it but it seems to be OK now.</li>
            <li> Best item to purchase if you want to save money.  Dries hair in 25 minutes on low no need to use high setting.  Worth the money</li>
            <li> Good , gives you good heat that covers all your head, when I saw the negative reviews I was worried but I really like lit and it does the purpose</li>
            <li> Works Well, However the Bonnet will not fully deploy without first raising the top adjuster fully. I think if someone had arthritis it would be near impossible to do. I will spray a little silicon on the slide and get it to move easier.Everything else on this product is excellent.</li>
            <li> It does not dry as fast</li>
            <li> Terrible experience. Product arrived broken and the quality of the material it was made out of was very poor. I will not recommended.</li>
            <li> Its a wonderful dryer.  No complaints, very sturdy, worth the money.  It has a lot of neat features involving the cord and the head piece actually swivels.</li>
            <li> awsome for my new short cut dries in 30 min folds down to almost nothing great if you have small storage space</li>
            <li> She can no longer hold a hair dryer for long periods of time or lift her arms past a certain height. She has surprisingly thick hair for an octogenarian. The dryer gets it dry, very quickly she says. She seems really happy with it. Though she just might not complain about anything wrong with it to her grandson.</li>
            <li> You have to sit over an hour to dry long thick hair but it&#x27;s convenient and easy to set up. It&#x27;s also noisy but tolerable.</li>
            <li> Nice and compact and dries hair super fast and the size is great for the large size rollers and the two settings gives you good options</li>
            <li> This dryer takes too long to dry my hair. My hair is long &amp; thick. plus these dryer is extremely LOUD</li>
            <li> Just got this today and have already used it.  Great product thus far.</li>
            <li> my wife loves it and use it 2-3 times a week.&lt;br /&gt;We love the way it folds up for storage.&lt;br /&gt;PeterB</li>
            <li> excellent article, very satisfied with the purchase and supplier Thanks</li>
            <li> Nothing fancy here but great for ladies on a budget! I use it pretty often during my wash days now.</li>
            <li> This might work for someone with short, thin hair but I have long, thick, curly hair and it made it frizzy. And it took forever. It just blew hot hair, didn&#x27;t really provide a smooth, heated dry, which is what I was looking for.</li>
