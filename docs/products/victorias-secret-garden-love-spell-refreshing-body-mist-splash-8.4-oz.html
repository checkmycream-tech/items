            <li>and it smells wonderful as long as you don&#x27;t douse yourself in it.</li>
            <li>This product is worth the money!!</li>
            <li>And this arrived pretty quickly and the price is great.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a huge van of love spell.</li>

            <li>(if you want a blossom smell, its very minute, but if you love fruity smells, you have it with this!)</li>
            <li>By far, this has been the most sexy smell ever!</li>
            <li>I think this is some kind of knock-off or fragrance imposter because it certainly doesn&#x27;t smell like the stuff they sell at the store.</li>
            <li>Still enjoy it.</li>
            <li>The price was amazing, thank you so much.</li>
            <li>The moment you drench yourself in this, you&#x27;ll smell like a really cheap bouquet.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;There is a problem with such a great scent...and it is by no means the product&#x27;s fault...</li>
            <li>nothing so fantastic.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m overall happy with the scent.</li>
            <li>I think it smells cheap and tacky.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>it came fast and it smells delightfully delicious and its big</li>
            <li>I have always loved love spell, and Im so excited that I ordered it as a Christmas present for myself</li>
            <li>Wish I could win more gift cards so I can buy other things.</li>
            <li>It has me feeling so clean, fresh, and sexy.</li>
            <li>It smells clean, and is lightly scented.&lt;br /&gt;jackie</li>

            <li>;)</li>
            <li>It is very fruity, and smells pretty fresh...</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Its exactly what it says it is.</li>
            <li>Guys compliment me on it all the time (as long as I don&#x27;t spray it on them) :]</li>
            <li>I ran out as fast as I got it because I used it so much!</li>
            <li>It was a HUGE bottle, and I&#x27;m still using it daily</li>
            <li>Only God knows how it received such an amazing review.</li>
            <li>It is a light fragrance that works well with different body lotions and soaps.  </li>
            <li>Probably not the real deal.</li>
            <li>the price is reasonable.</li>
            <li>plus it is very affordable.</li>
            <li>It has a light kinda fruity scent to it, but I would recommend it to someone younger which is probably why the woman who gave it one star gave it one star!</li>
            <li>Ok, I&#x27;m a guy, and I must say, I smelled this scent on a woman at the office whom I never really spoke to, and it made me notice her.  </li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t really see why.  </li>
            <li>I tell my wife your my secret place, you smell great.</li>
            <li>and it was shipped fast.</li>
            <li>I really like the fragrance of this body mist.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>responsible.</li>
            <li>EXCELENTE PERFE CTO FAST  </li>
            <li>It really seems to be the scent that the teens go for.</li>
            <li>I was ecstatic to find it on Amazon for so much cheaper.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>A smell of cheap plastic flowers mixed with a lot of alcohol.</li>
            <li>It smells very good, but as I seen on some other comments the sent does not last long.  </li>
            <li>looked brand new off the shelf!</li>
            <li>But honestly it&#x27;s just a really bad smell that doesn&#x27;t even mimic any kind of scent.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I used to use this in high school</li>
            <li>Seriously, I do not know a pretty girl who does not own a bottle of love spell.</li>
            <li>just be careful - be familiar with your seller.</li>
            <li>smells exactly like lovespell, only difference is that it&#x27;s in the discontinued packaging, but do not let that deter you!</li>
            <li>/&gt;This costs a little more (I think I only paid $9)</li>
            <li>when i saw it on amazon for #10 i quickly ordered it, i was excited to find that in 2 days it arrived, when i got it, the picture it has online here is not the same, the smell is the same but was surprised that it does not stay on as much as when i used to have it, but i do have to say that i am quite satisfied with the purchase, too bad</li>
            <li>I tried to give it to my young adult daughter, but she didn&#x27;t like it either.  </li>
            <li>The bottle is a different shape than the picture, but I don&#x27;t really care.</li>
            <li>It came early and lasted quite awhile.</li>
            <li>IT IS VEEEERY SOFTLY.</li>
            <li>it came different bottle but was same sent and everythng i cant complain aslong as i got the right product</li>
            <li>I actually received the newer bottle, instead of the older one pictured.</li>
            <li>The last time I smelled this scent was a few years ago and fell in love, but I had forgotten where it was from, until recently.</li>
            <li>This is by far my favorite scent from the Victoria&#x27;s Secret perfume collection.</li>
            <li>Definitely my second favorite of the &#x27;Secret Garden&#x27; line (Pure Seduction is my personal fav.)</li>
            <li>it smells so good like all the other victoria&#x27;s secret products.</li>
            <li>It came when I expected, and shipped fast.</li>
            <li>Love Spell is VS&#x27;s hottest Secret Garden product.</li>
            <li>I love Victoria Secret products but this one is just Ok.</li>
            <li>It has a fresh peachy scent that is not overwhelming.  </li>

            <li> By far, this has been the most sexy smell ever!</li>
            <li> I think this is some kind of knock-off or fragrance imposter because it certainly doesn&#x27;t smell like the stuff they sell at the store.</li>

            <li> nothing so fantastic.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m overall happy with the scent.</li>
            <li> I think it smells cheap and tacky.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> it came fast and it smells delightfully delicious and its big</li>

            <li> It is very fruity, and smells pretty fresh...</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> Its exactly what it says it is.</li>
            <li> Guys compliment me on it all the time (as long as I don&#x27;t spray it on them) :]</li>
            <li> I ran out as fast as I got it because I used it so much!</li>
            <li> It was a HUGE bottle, and I&#x27;m still using it daily</li>
            <li> Only God knows how it received such an amazing review.</li>
            <li> It is a light fragrance that works well with different body lotions and soaps.  </li>
            <li> Probably not the real deal.</li>
            <li> the price is reasonable.</li>
            <li> plus it is very affordable.</li>
            <li> It has a light kinda fruity scent to it, but I would recommend it to someone younger which is probably why the woman who gave it one star gave it one star!</li>
            <li> Ok, I&#x27;m a guy, and I must say, I smelled this scent on a woman at the office whom I never really spoke to, and it made me notice her.  </li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t really see why.  </li>
            <li> I tell my wife your my secret place, you smell great.</li>
            <li> and it was shipped fast.</li>
            <li> I really like the fragrance of this body mist.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> responsible.</li>
            <li> EXCELENTE PERFE CTO FAST  </li>
            <li> It really seems to be the scent that the teens go for.</li>
            <li> I was ecstatic to find it on Amazon for so much cheaper.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> A smell of cheap plastic flowers mixed with a lot of alcohol.</li>
            <li> It smells very good, but as I seen on some other comments the sent does not last long.  </li>
            <li> looked brand new off the shelf!</li>
            <li> But honestly it&#x27;s just a really bad smell that doesn&#x27;t even mimic any kind of scent.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I used to use this in high school</li>
            <li> Seriously, I do not know a pretty girl who does not own a bottle of love spell.</li>
            <li> just be careful - be familiar with your seller.</li>
            <li> smells exactly like lovespell, only difference is that it&#x27;s in the discontinued packaging, but do not let that deter you!</li>
            <li> /&gt;This costs a little more (I think I only paid $9)</li>
            <li> when i saw it on amazon for #10 i quickly ordered it, i was excited to find that in 2 days it arrived, when i got it, the picture it has online here is not the same, the smell is the same but was surprised that it does not stay on as much as when i used to have it, but i do have to say that i am quite satisfied with the purchase, too bad</li>
            <li> I tried to give it to my young adult daughter, but she didn&#x27;t like it either.  </li>
            <li> The bottle is a different shape than the picture, but I don&#x27;t really care.</li>
            <li> It came early and lasted quite awhile.</li>
            <li> IT IS VEEEERY SOFTLY.</li>
            <li> it came different bottle but was same sent and everythng i cant complain aslong as i got the right product</li>
            <li> I actually received the newer bottle, instead of the older one pictured.</li>
            <li> The last time I smelled this scent was a few years ago and fell in love, but I had forgotten where it was from, until recently.</li>
            <li> This is by far my favorite scent from the Victoria&#x27;s Secret perfume collection.</li>
            <li> Definitely my second favorite of the &#x27;Secret Garden&#x27; line (Pure Seduction is my personal fav.)</li>
            <li> it smells so good like all the other victoria&#x27;s secret products.</li>
            <li> It came when I expected, and shipped fast.</li>
            <li> Love Spell is VS&#x27;s hottest Secret Garden product.</li>
            <li> I love Victoria Secret products but this one is just Ok.</li>
            <li> It has a fresh peachy scent that is not overwhelming.  </li>
            <li> Their other scents are either sickly sweet (the word is saccharin I believe) like Pure Seduction, or hecka serious like something your hot 3rd grade teacher would wear, like secret charm.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not too strong, and not too weak!</li>
            <li> but the smell doesnt last long at all.</li>
            <li> Lasts a long time when worn with lotion or cream.</li>
            <li> ,  I HAVE A LONG TIME USING IT</li>
            <li> I have really dry, curly hair</li>
            <li> Not worth sending back for a refund-</li>
            <li> the bottle is pretty plus it is from Victoria&#x27;s Secret</li>
            <li> For the price I think the bottle could have been a little bit larger.  </li>
            <li> I got this body mist DAYS before I expected to.</li>
            <li> Product was as expected</li>
            <li> ENCHANTED KISS INTIMATE SECRET HAS THE IDENTICAL STUFF INSIDE</li>
            <li> I RECOMMEND THE PINK BOTTLE SEDUCTION..</li>
            <li> To the point I asked her what she was wearing a few days later</li>
            <li> I will purchase it directly in Victoria&#x27;s Secret in the future.</li>
            <li> I fell in love with VS &#x27;Secret Garden&#x27; line when I was thirteen and have never loved them any less since.    </li>
            <li> I thought it would be small but its very big for the price.</li>
            <li> have no problems with amazon, this is a review given due to the repulsive nature of the smell.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> It is kinda unique and when you use it, it seems you used a very expensive perfume.</li>
            <li> Pair it with the lotion and the scent will last half a day...and usually fragrances, even perfumes, have zero staying power on my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The product was a watered down version and due to being watered down, the scent lasts for about 5 minutes.  </li>
            <li> I believe the product now has less personality.</li>
            <li> I spray a little of this in my hair</li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t wash it everyday (</li>
            <li> or it gets dried out).</li>
            <li> My Daughter introduced me to this item back when Victorias secret sold it in their stores.</li>
            <li> Am I missing something?</li>
            <li> Its not a strong scent.</li>
            <li> AND IS DEFINATELY NOT REFRESHING</li>
            <li> i thought for the price it was going to be small because sum sellers on amazon are lying deceitful lil monkeys</li>
            <li> This perfume has powers over my weak male mind and by merely smelling of this stuff your attractiveness will increase.</li>
            <li> It was a little overpowering for a body spray!!</li>
            <li> What I did like is that I ordered it Tuesday late at night and received it Friday by noon.  </li>
            <li> You know what I mean?</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s bad it own little nasty way.</li>
            <li> I stay away from the ridiculously priced items.</li>
            <li> Seriously.</li>
            <li> I suggested she \\&quot;re-gift\\&quot; it to a co-worker, but she SERIOUSLY didn&#x27;t like the idea.  </li>
            <li> and it smells somewhat fruity, I would recommend it to anyone who likes a subtle scent.</li>
            <li> Granted, it is difficult to get sick or annoyed by this fragrance, but due to it&#x27;s immense popularity</li>
            <li> Smell reminds me of alcohol, maybe I am just sick of it after wearing it for a while and need something different.</li>
            <li> do not recommend buying Victorias secret body care online.</li>
            <li> I would suggest secret garden to my friends.</li>
            <li> cuz it really does smell horrible.</li>
            <li> I have used this perfume before from Victoria Secret.  </li>
            <li> A bottle of lotion or spray lasts a long time, and you don&#x27;t want to be stuck with some annoying scent.</li>
            <li> You cannot go wrong with this product from Victoria&#x27;s Secret.</li>
            <li> I get random whiffs of this at the mall, at restaurants, movie theaters, wherever.</li>
            <li> Sorry it did not work out.</li>
            <li> It is impossible to make a scent \\&quot;yours\\&quot; when everyone and their mom wears it.</li>
            <li> a wear it every once in awhile because I get sick of it.  </li>
            <li> Drives him crazy!!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed and will not purchase from this seller again.  </li>
            <li> Horrible.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Bought this because i remember loving the scent as a kid. Still enjoy it.Didn&#x27;t realize it would be so big though</li>
            <li> Very good attention I get the product on time, in perfect condition, very good quality is much charm I recommend them 100% on the entire community of amazon ....</li>
            <li> I got this body mist DAYS before I expected to. It was packaged in bubble wrap and was sealed with no damages to the bottle. The smell is great, and everything is in working order. I will be purchasing from this seller in the future.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love Victoria&#x27;s Secret Love Spell Refreshing Body Mist Splash. It has me feeling so clean, fresh, and sexy. It has a long-lasting fragrance too. You should try it!</li>
            <li> Such a great scent that is so sweet and everyone loves. Some of my friends actually even noticed it!</li>
            <li> Liked this very much.</li>
            <li> I have been very pleased with the bottle of Love Spell Body Mist purchased from Amazon.com.  It is a light fragrance that works well with different body lotions and soaps.  It is not too overpowering.  Very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I got this as a present and I absolutely love it! It smells great and lasts well for a body spray.  I will certainly be getting more of this for as long as it is available. This is my new favorite scent!!!</li>
            <li> Product was as expected</li>
            <li> Everyone and their grandpas know about this one.My ex boyfriend use to call this one the stripper purfume.Its sorta overrated to me and I dont want to smell like everyone else.ENCHANTED KISS INTIMATE SECRET HAS THE IDENTICAL STUFF INSIDE</li>
            <li> Came in great shape, one of my very favorite scents.</li>
            <li> Great buy!!! I love the spray. The price was amazing, thank you so much. Very satisfied with this product. Thanks!</li>
            <li> I ADDMIT I USE TO WEAR THIS IN MIDDLE SCHOOL BUT ITS ONE OF THOSE SMELLS THAT YOU GET TIERD OF . IT HAS A MUST TO IT AND IS DEFINATELY NOT REFRESHING AT ALL. SOMETIMES ALSO GAVE ME A HEAD ACE/ I RECOMMEND THE PINK BOTTLE SEDUCTION.. ITS A SWEET ROMANIC SMELL/</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this scent!  It has a fresh peachy scent that is not overwhelming.  I like to spray it on me, my pillows, my couch, etc.</li>
            <li> I love this scent. Been using it for years, since I was 14. I always get compliments on how good I smell when using I wear it.</li>
            <li> This perfume is simply unique and amazing.&lt;br /&gt;My highschool sweetheart wore this, about 4 years ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So when i found it again, I bought it for my clothes and bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You wont be dissapointed.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised when my order arrived faster than expected and the bottles were a lot bigger than the photos implies. This smell makes me so incredibly happy!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a weird scent, and smells okay when spritzed sparingly. The moment you drench yourself in this, you&#x27;ll smell like a really cheap bouquet. Just bleh. I&#x27;m happy that it was a gift and that I didn&#x27;t waste my money on it.</li>
            <li> This product is very nice! A perfect combination! Not too strong, and not too weak! I love this on my girl! can&#x27;t wait to give it to her for Christmas! Good price as well! I will buy again!</li>
            <li> I always buy this body splash, I love its smell. It is kinda unique and when you use it, it seems you used a very expensive perfume.</li>
            <li> I think this is some kind of knock-off or fragrance imposter because it certainly doesn&#x27;t smell like the stuff they sell at the store. Horrible.</li>
            <li> Love Spell is VS&#x27;s hottest Secret Garden product. It is great to get a deal on it here or other on line shopping venues just be careful - be familiar with your seller. There are a lot of fakes around. I stay away from the ridiculously priced items. I worked for this brand for several years and they do not support or allow independent sellers who sell at below wholesale pricing. Probably not the real deal. Just so you know.&lt;br /&gt;Outside of that - lovely scent. perfect for day or night.</li>
            <li> Coming from a 23 year old male let me tell you: this is the best smelling perfume on the planet. Sure lots of ladies wear this but there&#x27;s a very good reason for that. This perfume has powers over my weak male mind and by merely smelling of this stuff your attractiveness will increase. Seriously.</li>
            <li> i love love love this body spray from VS! not too strong of a scent. the price is reasonable. i was kind of sceptic of having this sent out to where i am, no leaking or any cracks. very satisfied with the seller.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this! It&#x27;s light and airy and fresh and natural and eve the bottle is pretty plus it is from Victoria&#x27;s Secret and I love that company plus it is very affordable. Very pleased with this product!:)</li>
            <li> I love Victoria Secret products but this one is just Ok. It smells pretty coming out of the bottle but the smell doesnt last long at all. Maybe I&#x27;ll try another scent.</li>
            <li> I have been using this stuff for years. It smells great but not too strong or perfumy. It makes any odors disappear. I have really dry, curly hair and I can&#x27;t wash it everyday (or it gets dried out). I spray a little of this in my hair and I have no dirty hair smell. Yay! It removes odors from clothes and wherever else. It&#x27;s a miracle product. I always keep some on hand.</li>
            <li> Love this scent.  If this doesn&#x27;t put you in the sweet mood, I don&#x27;t know what to tell you.  By far, this has been the most sexy smell ever! (to me!)  My husband loves it too! Drives him crazy!!</li>
            <li> This product came to me in a timely fashion with no issues.  It smells great and I love the price!</li>
            <li> My Daughter introduced me to this item back when Victorias secret sold it in their stores. Now, This is by far my favorite body spray, it lasts a long time &amp; smells fantastic! I also purchase the perfume, lotion &amp; body butter in this scent &amp; love them all! It is the perfect scent for the teens to the older ladies (Im 45) and makes a great gift as a set. A great item at a great price.</li>
            <li> My hubby says he wishes that there was a real fruit that smells like this! That should give you an idea of how great love spell is. It is sweet, tart, and refreshing. I feel happy when I wear this to sleep and wake up smelling it on my skin. Pair it with the lotion and the scent will last half a day...and usually fragrances, even perfumes, have zero staying power on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro:&lt;br /&gt;Hands down the sweetest yet most refreshing scent of all time! Lasts a long time when worn with lotion or cream. Very wearable and fit for all ocassions. Their other scents are either sickly sweet (the word is saccharin I believe) like Pure Seduction, or hecka serious like something your hot 3rd grade teacher would wear, like secret charm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;There is a problem with such a great scent...and it is by no means the product&#x27;s fault...which is....EVERYONE wears this!!! Seriously, I do not know a pretty girl who does not own a bottle of love spell. I get random whiffs of this at the mall, at restaurants, movie theaters, wherever. Then I come home and smell more of it on myself. Granted, it is difficult to get sick or annoyed by this fragrance, but due to it&#x27;s immense popularity I believe the product now has less personality. You know what I mean? It is impossible to make a scent \\&quot;yours\\&quot; when everyone and their mom wears it. Of course, I cannot take a star away from a product just because it is popular. But if you want something of your own, better look for another scent. They actually have lots of great scents for different personalities. Go to the store and try all of it. That was what I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another thing...&lt;br /&gt;I do not recommend buying Victorias secret body care online. You need to smell it to make sure you love it. A bottle of lotion or spray lasts a long time, and you don&#x27;t want to be stuck with some annoying scent. Also, they always, always have sales in store. You are likely to get this a lot cheaper. Last time I checked it was 7 for 40 bucks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over all, great scent, hubby loved it, and that&#x27;s all it matters :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for reading and hope this helped!bby loved it, and that&#x27;s all it matters :)    Thanks for reading and hope this helped!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed and will not purchase from this seller again.  The product was a watered down version and due to being watered down, the scent lasts for about 5 minutes.  Total rip off.  I will purchase it directly in Victoria&#x27;s Secret in the future.</li>
            <li> This was another wonderful transaction.  It was purchased with another item and I was extremely thrilled at how easy it was.  Trustworthy and received exactly what I wanted!  Couldn&#x27;t ask for better~</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the smell. It&#x27;s pretty long-lasting if you apply it correctly and it smells wonderful as long as you don&#x27;t douse yourself in it. Guys compliment me on it all the time (as long as I don&#x27;t spray it on them) :]</li>
            <li> WHAT are you all talking about?!  I ordered Lovespell based on the positive reviews-- Mistake!! It gave me an instant migraine, ugh.  I tried to give it to my young adult daughter, but she didn&#x27;t like it either.  I suggested she \\&quot;re-gift\\&quot; it to a co-worker, but she SERIOUSLY didn&#x27;t like the idea.  I couldn&#x27;t do that to my co-workers, either.  Not worth sending back for a refund- that&#x27;s why this fragrance is now casting it&#x27;s spell at the local landfill.</li>
            <li> Great fragrance, victoria´s secret garden love spell are soft and sexy, suitable for every day, very refreshing body mist splash, you will love it.</li>
            <li> wow this stuff is amazing!!! it smells so good like all the other victoria&#x27;s secret products. It has a light kinda fruity scent to it, but I would recommend it to someone younger which is probably why the woman who gave it one star gave it one star!</li>
            <li> very good. excellent.</li>
            <li> Smell reminds me of alcohol, maybe I am just sick of it after wearing it for a while and need something different.</li>
            <li> Ok, I&#x27;m a guy, and I must say, I smelled this scent on a woman at the office whom I never really spoke to, and it made me notice her.  To the point I asked her what she was wearing a few days later so I could buy it for my wife.  Now I&#x27;m here on amazon ordering it.  So it works.  I&#x27;m just sayin&#x27;...</li>
            <li> This scent has been popular since high school.  Everyone from all ages raves about it but I don&#x27;t really see why.  It&#x27;s a nice scent but nothing so fantastic.  a wear it every once in awhile because I get sick of it.  It&#x27;s very light and I feel like you have to spray it on all throughout the day if you want it to last.</li>
            <li> This is by far my favorite scent from the Victoria&#x27;s Secret perfume collection. And this arrived pretty quickly and the price is great. I love it.</li>
            <li> This perfume makes my chest swell up and my heart hurt. I gave it away to someone who did not have that problem. I wanted to like it-it smells like bath and body works grape... something. Sorry it did not work out.</li>
            <li> The scent is not for me personally. Had I known it smelled like fruit I would have not purchased it.</li>
            <li> I bought this cell because I like samsung despite its size because it works for me is so practical and buy him</li>
            <li> it smells great I thought it would be small but its very big for the price. it was wrapped up so nice so it wouldn&#x27;t spill it was a perfect buy.</li>
            <li> It was an excellent purchase!! I recommend this item. The seller is great. It&#x27;s a gift and I think was the best choice.</li>
            <li> Great Price and this is my very favorite fragrance, Will be buying more when needed and this is one of the best product I have gotten from Amazon</li>
            <li> This is such a delightful scent.  I get a lot of compliments when I &amp;#34;wear&amp;#34; it.  It&#x27;s definitely a scent I&#x27;m sticking with!  I recommend this product to any woman who wants compliments!</li>
            <li> This body mist has a great smell, and my wife absolutely loves it.  It is understated and very much fresh.  You cannot go wrong with this product from Victoria&#x27;s Secret.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m overall happy with the scent. I bought it without ever smelling it, just because I had heard good things. Smells kind of fruity, Not to costly, and doesn&#x27;t smell cheap. The bottle is a different shape than the picture, but I don&#x27;t really care. I would suggest secret garden to my friends.</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance and I am very happy how fast my order arrived at my house after I submitted my order!</li>
            <li> If you like the smell of peaches, cherry blossom, and jasmine, you will love this. Its not a strong scent. I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Gave as gift for my wife.  She wears it almost daily so I figure I must of done something good.</li>
            <li> This body spray smells so good I use this when I shower in the morning and at night. It does not have a strong scent but people will notice it on you. I bought this for my mom and for my friends and they love it so pick up a bottle or two you will love it</li>
            <li> Everyone loves how this smells! compliments constantly!</li>
            <li> I tell my wife your my secret place, you smell great. I love been around a woman that smell sexy</li>
            <li> I am satisfied with this purchase because it is what I really needed and it came right on time and with all specifications.</li>
            <li> great price......love this.</li>
            <li> I fell in love with VS &#x27;Secret Garden&#x27; line when I was thirteen and have never loved them any less since.    &#x27;Love Spell&#x27; is the perfect name for this scent; it&#x27;s alluring and mysterious yet fresh and sweet, long lasting and not overpowering.   Definitely my second favorite of the &#x27;Secret Garden&#x27; line (Pure Seduction is my personal fav.)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a huge van of love spell. This was cheaper than buying it in the store and it arrived sooner than I thought.</li>
            <li> Buy it all the time. Smells great. A friend I have HATES ANY KIND of perfume or body spray. Get this! He actually said I SMELL GOOD! This one doesn&#x27;t have an overbearing perfume smell, it is mostly citrusy and I&#x27;ve walked into rooms and people ask why it smells like a basket of fruit was delivered.</li>
            <li> smells exactly like lovespell, only difference is that it&#x27;s in the discontinued packaging, but do not let that deter you!</li>
            <li> My hubby loves this smell and I like it too. I was glad to get it at a decent price and it was shipped fast.</li>
            <li> My Mon love the perfume it have. It was the perfect combination, this splash and the body cream, the ones she ask for,</li>
            <li> I really like the fragrance of this body mist. It&#x27;s very fresh and clean. I like the mist because it last long and was a great buy.</li>
            <li> I love Victoria Secrets  But I love your prices they can&#x27;t be beat  Thank you Amazon,you are great  very prompt about sending package.  Thank you Bonnie smith</li>
            <li> This perfume is great for people who like fruity scents. It smells a lot like peaches. My boyfriend likes it, so it&#x27;s a keeper.</li>
            <li> I always loved this body spray so when i saw it on amazon for #10 i quickly ordered it, i was excited to find that in 2 days it arrived, when i got it, the picture it has online here is not the same, the smell is the same but was surprised that it does not stay on as much as when i used to have it, but i do have to say that i am quite satisfied with the purchase, too bad there weren&#x27;t more reviews on this product, people think that their review won&#x27;t matter but it makes a very big difference, PEOPLE PLEASE GIVE A REVIEW FOR EACH PRODUCT YOU PURCHASE FROM AMAZON IT WILL MAKE ALL THE DIFFERENCE. Thank you have a great day all! :)</li>
            <li> AWSOME....LOVE.... THIS STUFF......IT SMELLS SOOOO, SOOO GOOD.</li>
            <li> It smells like flowery sweet peaches! I It&#x27;s light and delicate and a great mist to layer as often as you like. I&#x27;m quite happy how peachy it smells (if you want a blossom smell, its very minute, but if you love fruity smells, you have it with this!)</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s what I say when people say they like this scent. At best it smells like a car freshener. But honestly it&#x27;s just a really bad smell that doesn&#x27;t even mimic any kind of scent. It&#x27;s bad it own little nasty way. I just don&#x27;t get how many people say this is their favorite. Am I missing something? I don&#x27;t care though I&#x27;m still hatin&#x27; on this cuz it really does smell horrible.</li>
            <li> The last time I smelled this scent was a few years ago and fell in love, but I had forgotten where it was from, until recently. The package arrived pretty quickly and with no damage. The scent is heavenly and just how I remember it, fresh and fruity. I love it so much. I&#x27;d definitely recommend it to others. :)</li>
            <li> such a beautiful scent and came very nicely wrapped. looked brand new off the shelf! very impressed with this product</li>
            <li> For the price I think the bottle could have been a little bit larger.  The fragrance was nice and the sprayer was in great shape.</li>
            <li> This was an accidental purchase. It has a really good scent to it. I gave it to my cousin. .</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like the scent!! It was a little overpowering for a body spray!! Plus, I constantly sneezed after I used it!!</li>
            <li> My favorite scent. It came early and lasted quite awhile.</li>
            <li> I have always loved love spell, and Im so excited that I ordered it as a Christmas present for myself ;) It came when I expected, and shipped fast. Thanks.</li>

            <li> I really love this smell it screams summer and it smells somewhat fruity, I would recommend it to anyone who likes a subtle scent.</li>
            <li> This is a favorite scent of my granddaughter. It really seems to be the scent that the teens go for. It smells clean, and is lightly scented.&lt;br /&gt;jackie</li>
            <li> One of my favorite scents of all time. Been using it for years! It really smells like love.</li>
            <li> This perfume smells great I love it. it is girly and fruity I had to order to</li>
            <li> Y BOUGHT THIS PRODUCT FOR MY WIFE AND SHE LOVE IT. SHE FEELS VERY HAPPY WHIT THIS SPLAHS IT IS VEEEERY SOFTLY. I RECOMEND THIS ITEM IT CAME TO MY HOUSE ON TIME.</li>
            <li> I have used this perfume before from Victoria Secret.  It smells very good, but as I seen on some other comments the sent does not last long.  It is obviously not Amazons fault for that.  What I did like is that I ordered it Tuesday late at night and received it Friday by noon.  Very fast delivery.  The smell is also great too.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> I love It. Wish I could win more gift cards so I can buy other things. Amozon you all rock</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife for a stocking stuffer. When she opened it up and saw the bottle, i could tell she would enjoy the mist greatly! the sent is pleasant and the 8.4 oz bottle is just the right size! I would suggest you buy some for your lady!</li>
            <li> this goes so well with another spray I have,&lt;br /&gt;love it, I have used for years and it is light and enjoyable.</li>
            <li> Smells good! Very crisp w/a citrus  smell. Would be great for the summer and spring not too heavy nor light and last w/you all day. Leaves a nice light yet memorable lingering fragrance behind.</li>
            <li> the problem when i buy on line is that i don&#x60;t know how this stuff smell i just guess so it&#x60;s ok but i won buy again because there are better ones very mild good for those that like mild scent  i use it after a bought it every morning after my shower .</li>
            <li> Love Spell is my favorite scent. I was ecstatic to find it on Amazon for so much cheaper.&lt;br /&gt;I love it. It was a HUGE bottle, and I&#x27;m still using it daily ( I bought it before Christmas).&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend. ;)</li>
            <li> Buying various scents online is always hard since we aren&#x27;t able to smell them, but it smelled awesome, and I wear it often!</li>
            <li> I always order from hubbys account. Great smell i love it came different bottle but was same sent and everythng i cant complain aslong as i got the right product</li>
            <li> SMELL GOOD,  I HAVE A LONG TIME USING IT AND I LOVE IT.  WHEN I USE IT I FEEL FRESH AND GIRLY</li>
            <li> I love this it came fast and it smells delightfully delicious and its big i thought for the price it was going to be small because sum sellers on amazon are lying deceitful lil monkeys xD but i loved this it WAS the bomb it made my nose have a party.. you need this in yo life!:D i give this two toes up :D</li>
            <li> Only God knows how it received such an amazing review. .. I bought it after going through the amazing reviews on amazon. .. n when it arrived was super excited to try it on. .. Probably does not work the same way on every skin... didnt work for me.</li>
            <li> Hi,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This costs a little more (I think I only paid $9) then sprays you can get at the drugstore, but it smells really good. It has a sweet fuity smell. I liked the smell, but for me lavender scents seem to last longer. This smells really, really good for a short time. That may be OK though, as it won&#x27;t be over powering like too much perfume can be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d buy it again, it&#x27;s very nice scent if you (or someone close to you) likes you smelling sweet.</li>
            <li> i love it!  i&#x27;ve been getting this one for year&#x27;s and everyone compliments on it.  it smells really great!  would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> Yuck!!! A smell of cheap plastic flowers mixed with a lot of alcohol. I think it smells cheap and tacky.&lt;br /&gt;I have no problems with amazon, this is a review given due to the repulsive nature of the smell.&lt;br /&gt;This is just my opinion. Thanks!</li>
            <li> Smells great! Gave it away as a gift and they loved it. I recommend this body splash. They will love it!</li>
            <li> great smeell of the splash smeell better than i thought hmmm and the its not expensive at all easy to carry on my bag</li>
            <li> I loved it! I ran out as fast as I got it because I used it so much! It smells so fresh, clean, sexy, calm and just so me!!! I plan to purchase more just as soon as I can!</li>
            <li> I actually received the newer bottle, instead of the older one pictured. Same lovely scent!</li>
            <li> It is a great product and very good quality. I am very satisfied with this purchase. Thank you.</li>
            <li> You will get more than your paying for with this product. Its exactly what it says it is. LOVE IT</li>
            <li> I ALWAYS PURCHASE THIS FRAGRANCE AND WILL CONTINUE TO DO SO, MY SONS AND DAUGHTER IN LAWS KNOW IT AND ALWAYS BUY THIS FOR ME AND I TOLD THEM TO GET THEM A AMAZON.COM, IT&#x27;S CHEAPER AND SAVES THEM GAS.</li>
            <li> i would buy gallons of this stuff at a time if i could! love spell is a fruity/fresh smell, not floral. Makes you smell crisp and clean. I actually think it smells a bit like fruit loops.</li>
