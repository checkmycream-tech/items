            <li>I was so thrilled, then, to receive a really nice quality wig!  </li>

            <li>that finds the wig attractive by the pic alone will love this product.</li>
            <li>i am very pleased with the product quailty with the price I paid for.</li>
            <li>I believe i would be really happy with this wig had it come as many of the others described theirs.</li>
            <li>I believe this may just be a fluke since so many others have had great experiences with theirs.</li>
            <li>Very pleased with this product.</li>

            <li>I am very pleased.  </li>
            <li>it isn&#x27;t that good for it, so I use my own brush.</li>
            <li>Honestly,  I am a stylist and have no problem giving it a trim, but for the price you pay this wig is a good deal.</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t get knotted up easy to brush just all around beautiful</li>
            <li>Fits perfectly well and there is even a strap to adjust the wig to fit your head better.</li>
            <li>the fit is perfect, the look is even better.</li>
            <li>It would be awesome if it had clips to make it more secure</li>
            <li>Also it tangles very easily and sheds a good bit as well.  </li>
            <li>The clip is nice and right and the bangs are the perfect length.</li>

            <li>, I got it how I liked it.</li>
            <li>2 get looking nice</li>
            <li>I am so thrilled with this purchase that 3 family members have already purchased it as well</li>
            <li>I did not expect a wig this nice for this price...</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s as nice as it is for the price.</li>
            <li>it nice but</li>
            <li>I wanted a wig, a nice wig</li>
            <li>when I sent the wig back I experienced some of the best customer service I&#x27;ve ever gotten.</li>
            <li>The length is a really nice length, too.  </li>
            <li>Looks awesome everyone thinks its my real hair.</li>
            <li>but my own fault for not washing beforehand.</li>
            <li>and I got say it again that it really could be the best one for this price!!!The color</li>
            <li>The hair itself is nice.</li>
            <li>It comes with it&#x27;s own brush</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s own mesh skull cap</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own.  </li>
            <li>I have felt nice synthetic hair</li>
            <li>Nice curl to the ends</li>
            <li>so I really liked it in the beginning</li>
            <li>It was well packed when I got it, with its own box in the outer box.</li>
            <li>Almost all of our friends think it looks like my girlfriend&#x27;s own hair when she wearing it.  </li>
            <li>It has a couple bald patches around the crown area, and the bangs don&#x27;t seem to be in any kind of shape.</li>
            <li>are nice</li>
            <li>So I started using my own softening shampoos/conditioners and it kind of help.</li>
            <li>Really nice wig for the price.</li>
            <li>The color and feeling of the wig are nice.</li>
            <li>Bought this for my roommate, she liked it a lot.</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast too, very happy with my purchase!!</li>
            <li>My brother walked in and asked if I went and got my hair done because it looked so nice.</li>
            <li>The bangs were kind of tricky to fix.</li>
            <li>Nice product although wish it was fuller.</li>
            <li>, it fits perfectly, and looks/feels incredibly real.</li>
            <li>Color is really nice</li>
            <li>nice look</li>
            <li>The hair seems like nice quality but the bangs look like someone just chopped away at them.</li>
            <li>It looks nice, but the length makes it so that it just looks unnatural.</li>
            <li>Also to note that it includes a fish-net cap to hold your own hair into the wig.</li>
            <li>The hair itself was nice hoowever this wig looks nothing like the picture</li>
            <li>its a nice wig for Halloween</li>
            <li>The color is a nice chocolate brown and you can style and cut it if you need to.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad they included the comb I never would have bought one this good.</li>
            <li>Nice packaging - thankful to have the comb, cap, and care instructions in a nice box to keep it all together.</li>
            <li>Thrilled with this purchase.  </li>
            <li>Loving it.</li>

            <li>I like to keep my hair pixie-short and wanted to be able to play with longer styles without having to grow out my hair.</li>
            <li>Wig is okay, basically you get like one wear out of it.</li>
            <li>I bought this wig and I love it</li>
            <li>Looks really cute with a beanie, and hides some of the over puffiness of the bangs.</li>
            <li>Fabulous!</li>

            <li>This wig feels sOO nice, comfortable and shiny love it</li>
            <li>Love this wig.</li>
            <li>Okay,i&#x27;d have to say i love this wig.</li>
            <li>Since it was cheaper than most wigs, I was expecting this.</li>
            <li>i LOVE it.</li>
            <li>You can wear it just like the model is or style it differently its great!</li>
            <li>This wig is the best quality I have found yet, especially for the price.  </li>
            <li>And about the cover of the inner side, it&#x27;s quite exquisite in every detail.</li>
            <li>This Halloween, I got the red one, very impressed with the package.</li>
            <li>is more realstic. :)</li>
            <li>and I still take pics in it :)</li>
            <li>In my opinion, the tangles kind of make it look more like real hair, so that&#x27;s a good thing.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Looks believable if you get it on your head</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s more of a medium/dark)&lt;br /&gt;Easy</li>
            <li>I have no hair and it still felt so much better with</li>
            <li>See how the pics don&#x27;t show the top part ?</li>
            <li>Hair is not too plastic-looking, I don&#x27;t think most people know it&#x27;s a wig.</li>
            <li>My wife wore the wig to a costume party and received many compliments.</li>
            <li>Its more like a grayish-brown color.</li>
            <li>wig is ok, you get what you pay for.  </li>
            <li>I love the price and the fact that the wigs come with a comb.</li>
            <li>The quality of this wig is amazing, it looks good, and feels like real hair also</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s stunning.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad that i got it</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments.</li>
            <li>I definitely recommend this wig and the price is great!!!</li>
            <li>Will do OK for costume</li>
            <li>I should hv known better.</li>
            <li>i cant stand this on my head for more than an hour, which is kinda pointelss.</li>
            <li>I trimmed it as needed, and just love this one.</li>
            <li>Got so many compliments on it, too.</li>
            <li>Love wearing this wig.</li>
            <li>Really love this wig I wish I knew how to put up a pic ...</li>
            <li>I received many compliments.</li>
            <li>It did come in a nice box, with a wig comb and a cheap fishnet cap.</li>
            <li>for the wig, it is absolutely stunning.</li>
            <li>love love love this item.</li>
            <li>I love this wig.</li>
            <li>I really love this wig, but for some reason, i cannot get it to stay on, and it may be my head shape or something</li>
            <li>I get so many compliments when I wear it.</li>
            <li>It was everything the reviews said it was and more.</li>
            <li>It provided more then what I asked, including a wig cap and comb.</li>
            <li>came across this wig at such an excellent price and figured I would try it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and I can do so many things with it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but the wig is more sereal than anything...&lt;br /&gt;dawn</li>
            <li>Id love to return</li>
            <li>The more I wear this the more I love it.</li>
            <li>but it works for my purpose, and i&#x27;m really glad i bought it:)</li>
            <li>However, I think if someone was 40 feet away from me - or if you have a hat on top of it - they wouldn&#x27;t be able to tell that it is a wig.</li>
            <li>So many compliments on this wig</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an okay wig I guess.</li>
            <li>Very  sexy and full wig.  </li>
            <li>But if that is what your looking for then I recommend you buy it now. :)</li>
            <li>My husbad loves and and asked when I can buy more of them.</li>
            <li>and I love that it came so lond.</li>
            <li>It could be ok for a costume</li>

            <li>Buy something better.</li>
            <li>I love the comb it came with</li>
            <li>and I love how it came with a wig cap also.</li>
            <li>You can even brush the top where the bang area is to get the bangs how you want them.</li>
            <li>I will deffinately buy more.</li>
            <li>Love the length &amp; curl.</li>
            <li>Cute but brown was not my color and also it felt plastic like which I don&#x27;t like</li>
            <li>I will do some research and invest in a wig that can be worn more then a couple of times before it has to be thrown away.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t wait to buy more.</li>
            <li>And I have to say I love it.</li>
            <li>Just got it in the mail today and love it...</li>
            <li>and i think this ones better then</li>
            <li>It is a lovely wig for things like cosplay/modelling but out in the world, girls might call you out on it.</li>
            <li>i will b ordering 5 maybe 6 more</li>
            <li>Looks much better on than in the stock photos, but was everything I wanted all together.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in love with it :)</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe the price was so low for this great wig!</li>
            <li>eventually(which would cause more damage)</li>
            <li>I wish they had more lighter colors.</li>
            <li>I got so many compliments when I was wearing it.</li>
            <li>, they never considered it might be a wig. &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>I am going through chemo &amp; like this wig better than the $300 one that I bought.</li>
            <li>I ordered 3 more as backups :-)</li>
            <li>i was glad that i found this wig</li>
            <li>Love it...</li>
            <li>to style the top so no one can see the cap</li>
            <li>Will be buying more wigs from this vendor.</li>
            <li>But it served me when I need it most</li>
            <li>IT fits her well:) for $15 dollars its a steal.</li>
            <li>I had a great laugh when i originally got it/</li>
            <li>I love this wig and it&#x27;s very good quality, barely any strands have fallen out in almost two months!</li>
            <li>Nice wig has been easy to work with and restyling has been easy.</li>
            <li>Shipped fast, fits perfect and its adjustable and it feels real!</li>
            <li>it looks very realistic and nice!</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly and I&#x27;m glad it did!</li>
            <li>I found it very comfortable and easy to wear.</li>
            <li>But for about $15 it&#x27;s a pretty good deal.</li>
            <li>It was soft and beautiful.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gorgeous and looks real!</li>
            <li>I am going to have so much fun with this!!</li>
            <li>and he thought it was real at first!</li>
            <li>wig is very long, and beautiful!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great fit and looks real.</li>
            <li>I sprayed it with dry shampoo to get rid of the shine, and it was perfect.</li>
            <li>Good for the price, but far from amazing.</li>
            <li>I also have a bigger head, and it fit perfectly, so that was a relief</li>
            <li>when opening i saw the items in the package and was very surprised and happy.</li>
            <li>Great product for the price and so natural looking!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just fun to change yourself every once in awhile, I wish more people would wear wigs!..</li>
            <li>The quality of the wig is beautiful -- with one major flaw.  </li>
            <li>It is however, a very good quality wig, especially for the price.</li>
            <li>real,,and is very full.</li>
            <li>Amazing, worth every penny.</li>
            <li>Pros: cute, cheap and affordable&lt;br /&gt;Cons:</li>
            <li>However, I feel like shorter hair would be able to fit.</li>
            <li>Make sure if you brush, brush your wig lightly and try to reform the curls it came with.</li>
            <li>It looks natural and even though it&#x27;s synthetic it feels great.</li>
            <li>I love the color and the fit</li>
            <li>Plus, it&#x27;s a great natural color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very cute on the first day then it got matted...</li>
            <li>Cute &amp; comfortable wig</li>
            <li>It is comfortable to wear and I love the style, everyone just assumed I had gotten extensions when they saw it</li>
            <li>Let me say this it would be great for a one time use like Halloween but not everyday.</li>
            <li>Great natural looking wig (unplastic looking).</li>
            <li>absolutely freaking loved this wig.</li>
            <li>Everyone keeps saying how good my hair looks, some people still think this is my real hair!&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Packaging:&lt;br /&gt;It came packaged nicely with a complimentary comb and wig cap.</li>
            <li>It looks real and fits good.</li>
            <li>: Do remember that it is a wig and that it does require special care, so take care of it well!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m gonna love wearing this in front of my whole school!!!</li>
            <li>This is a great first wig but there was a cap end hanging out right at the part</li>
            <li>curls were perfect but be careful taking it out because It does tangle easily, and the comb they provide doesn&#x27;t help.</li>
            <li>But other wise this products looks so real and feels amazing!&lt;br /&gt;Great product for this great a price!</li>
            <li>I am fully satisfied with this purchase and of course my girlfriend love it very much, thank you Melodysusie!</li>
            <li>It came in very nice, professional packaging.</li>
            <li>This is a very nice wig with flattering bangs and natural color.</li>
            <li>Other than my laziness to comb it after every use, it&#x27;s awesome!</li>
            <li>so I had to trim them a bit, but other than that the cap fits perfectly and the wig is straigtenable.</li>
            <li>Sometimes I have to comb the bangs just so, so the cap doesn&#x27;t show underneath, but it&#x27;s been easy to fix.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to take care if though it tangles easily.</li>
            <li>It does tangle easily though.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also really easy to style.</li>
            <li>and it was easy to manage and put on.</li>
            <li>Seems like an easy return.</li>
            <li>The package came to my house very quickly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 5&#x27;7&amp;#34; and it touched my butt and did tangle easily.</li>
            <li>But it does get tangled kinda easily, but please believe me, every wig gets tangled and maintenance is important!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It tangled easily.  </li>
            <li>Best wig I have ever bought so far it feels and looks real</li>
            <li>I recieved it very quickly, maybe 3 days after I ordered it.</li>
            <li>if I have to it looks like an easy fix.</li>
            <li>i think that it gets tangled way too easy...</li>
            <li>I am extremely pleased with this wig, it looks so gorgeous and natural.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so easy to style</li>
            <li>I can where this anywhere face and easy to maintain</li>
            <li>Once you put the wig, it is easy to swipe the bangs to the side or pin them up to the side which is what I did.</li>
            <li>, it doesn&#x27;t seem to tangle too easily either.</li>
            <li>October 6th item arrived October 11th was not tangled but tangles EASILY</li>
            <li>it arrived very quick to so yea.</li>
            <li>Would recommend to anybody and everbody, whether you wear wigs often or not since it&#x27;s such a nice, easy way to change your look and feel good about yourself.</li>
            <li>Youre better off buying real hair wefts and making your own wig.</li>
            <li>I was worried because I have a pretty big head, but it fit great! :)</li>

            <li>it was nice the first day i got it but quickly fell apart and got all ratted.</li>
            <li>even my mom who isnt a fan of wigs and such said it looked gorgeous and realistic, and for only like 17$, very happy with my purchase :3</li>
            <li>You&#x27;d have to have a very small head to get this to fit you perfectly without poofing up from the top</li>
            <li>Very nice looking Enough hair to trim up to fit your style.</li>
            <li>Make sure you&#x27;re buying it from the right seller.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 5&#x27;4\\&quot; in height and the hair falls right on top of my bum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Beautiful... VERY, very long.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t get over how excited I am to find a cheap wig that&#x27;s fantastic quality</li>
            <li>and everyone thinks it&#x27;s my REAL HAIR!!!</li>
            <li>I love it, its a little shiny but wig shampoo takes that away and its wonderful for a first time wig wearer.</li>
            <li>Fit great and looks very real and classy.</li>
            <li>Overall I am very happy with this wig and it looks so realistic on.</li>
            <li>this is beautiful, and soft, and very realistic...</li>
            <li>This might not be something you would want to wear every day, but for a special occasion, it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li>High quality and very beautiful and deep color.</li>
            <li>I love the high quality this wig gives you for such a good price!</li>
            <li>This wig looks amazing and and incredibly realistic.</li>
            <li>but then again this is my first wig and loved it so much that I ordered others and have been doing research.</li>
            <li>All in all, for the $18 I spent on my first wig, this was a great deal!</li>
            <li>Melody was a nice wig the style was really nice, but the only thing is that it shed a lot and it matte up quickly.</li>
            <li>It does get super tangled easy</li>
            <li>tangles easily and is VERY hot to wear.</li>
            <li>I just gave it alittle hair cut and a real good deep conditioner to make the hair look brand new again.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s totally worth the money!</li>
            <li>The wig was okay at first but after having it on once it became tangled and unmanageable.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t speak to the issue of styling it as I plan to use it as it is, but it is exactly what I wanted for a better price than I could have imagined.</li>
            <li>Totally worth the buy!</li>
            <li>Love it looks like real hair and feels like it to!</li>
            <li>I originally bought this for myself, but ended up giving it to my sister because it made her feel like Miss America.</li>
            <li>This wig also is for small head shapes and that they provide an awesome comb and wig cap.  </li>
            <li>Really worth the money!</li>
            <li>Buy this wig you will love it as much as I do!</li>
            <li>Definitely worth buying!</li>
            <li>Well worth the money!</li>
            <li>Cool and comfortable.</li>
            <li>My friends always get excited when they see me wearing this wig and they all want to wear it.</li>
            <li>and once I opened the box I was so excited.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, definitely worth the price!</li>
            <li>We all think it looks beautiful, natural and realistic.</li>
            <li>Very thick, soft, natural feeling hair at a great great great price.</li>
            <li>I am loving my new wig.</li>
            <li>I would recommend if you are looking for a nice wig to wear every now and again:) or if you are like me and have a short pixie cut that you like to change up every now and again.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s more of a southern belle, kind of look.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t as curly as I thought it would be, but I think it still looks amazing since I mostly ordered it for the volume and length not necessarily for the curls.</li>
            <li>everyone thinks its my hair!!!greqt price..and super comfortable.  </li>
            <li>Super cheap.</li>
            <li>Many people thought I actually dyed my own hair.</li>
            <li>Totally unexpected, but I&#x27;m not complaining; I loved it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, considering the price, it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>With those adjustments done, this wig looks very natural and the waves are nice.</li>
            <li>And it will defiantly last a long time, make sure you take good care of it! :)</li>
            <li>This wig was super great, it is really long</li>
            <li>This is one of the most natural looking wigs available, and at such a great price.</li>
            <li>So I have a teal Mohawk which isn&#x27;t a great hairstyle for a professional career, so I decide to try out wigs to see if it was a worthy investment to get a real hair wig.</li>
            <li>It came with a wig cap and a special comb.  </li>
            <li>THE PRICE IS RIGHT!</li>
            <li>and I got it right on time !</li>
            <li>I will say the curls make it a little hard to comb out at the ends, but for the most part it&#x27;s the best wig I&#x27;ve ever own!</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this wig it takes heat not to high frm cheap ceramic curlers  </li>
            <li>I do recommend buying this beautiful wig especially at this price, girls Halloween is coming!!!like much cuter.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s far from perfect; it&#x27;s way too long for example.</li>
            <li>Surprised how nice this is at such a good price!I have paid over 100 dollars before and it wasnt near as nice as this.</li>
            <li>Lol its the same colir as my real hair just longer and with bangs.!</li>
            <li>It makes me confident and feel very feminine.</li>
            <li>You could probably just throw something on it to make it more matte if you really wanted to wear it out.</li>
            <li>I have a full head of hair</li>
            <li>but the color is nice and the texture soft and silky.</li>
            <li>You definitely get a good deal for the price.</li>
            <li>While the color is true in the picture the style is not.  </li>
            <li>so I just pinned it back and it looked good that way</li>
            <li>but if you pin them back you can make them look really good.</li>
            <li>This wig is cute for dress up but does not look as real as I thought it would.</li>
            <li>I love this wig and the color matches my real hair.</li>
            <li>Like I said I like the style, but to keep this style a whole year and buy 6 more of them</li>
            <li>I love the feel of the hair, but it came tangled, and I am trying to figure out a gentle way of fixing that as well.</li>
            <li>True color&lt;br</li>
            <li>But I keep it moisturized with argan oil and keep it washed, brushed, and curled/straightened with heat protector to take good care of it and keep it from getting too tangled and matted.</li>
            <li>Overall good product.</li>
            <li>Talk about a good find at such an affordable price!LOVE,LOVE,LOVE!</li>
            <li>Overall good product.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s comfortable and fun.</li>
            <li>The wig wasn&#x27;t that full.</li>
            <li>The wig is a lot longer than it appears in the picture and not as full.</li>
            <li>this wig will definitely make you look good.  </li>
            <li>its not as full as in the picture</li>
            <li>Such a good unit for the price.</li>
            <li>it wasn&#x27;t as full as I thought it would be.</li>
            <li>I love it so much I bought it two times.</li>
            <li>But I love it so much that I bought it again</li>
            <li>Thick and Beautiful and just as described!</li>
            <li>It is a very flirty, sexy style.</li>
            <li>The service was good, so the company is not to blame, but I warn girls with larger heads that this will not work for you.</li>
            <li>, no wig is going to stay perfect, it&#x27;s just common sense.</li>
            <li>so that&#x27;s good enough for me.</li>
            <li>I took 6-7 inches off and gave it full bangs.</li>
            <li>Not bad for the price.</li>
            <li>not a bad purchase, descent quality.</li>
            <li>Very pleased, better than I expected.</li>
            <li>For the price, really Not bad at all.  </li>
            <li>It arrived QUICKLY, which is awesome, I was a bit surprised at how long the wig was on me, but nonetheless, I like it.</li>
            <li>Oh and it seems to tangle pretty easily, but when it does, it gives it that, &amp;#34;carefree, undone&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I feel that this is a bonus because it&#x27;s easy to cut it shorter, but you can&#x27;t exactly grow a wig out if you want it longer.</li>
            <li>Was pretty, tangled easily though.</li>
            <li>Really pretty fits well tangles a lil easy</li>
            <li>She has many wigs in different color and length but this one is the best ever, with its natural color and soft feeling.</li>
            <li>The wig I bought looks just like my natural hair, and looked great and natural even after trimming and gently combing (be sure to start combing from the bottom of the wig and work your way up towards the roots to avoid excess tangles.)</li>
            <li>Very realistic, I was thrilled when someone thought it was my real hair</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this to anyone who wants a cheap but nice wig!</li>
            <li>A very good product, complete with hair net.</li>
            <li>But once I trimmed it, it looks much more realistic and is easier to manage.</li>
            <li>Pretty sweet deal for being that cheap, though.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve purchased more realistic looking wigs at Halloween express.</li>
            <li>The top layers are very short, around shoulder length, which gives the hair a lot of texture, which is favorable to many.</li>
            <li>It arrived quickly and neatly packaged.</li>
            <li>shipping quick</li>
            <li>return was quick and easy.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li>for a quick selfie.</li>
            <li>It&#x27; really amazing to me that the seller sent these for free as my girlfriend always needs to buy the extra the wig cap since these no cap of the wig she bought before.</li>
            <li>However, based on the reviews I was expecting something with a more realistic feel.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really cute in a low pony tail, and the length was not outrageous</li>
            <li>but it gets tangled way to quickly</li>
            <li>This is a great product, the feel of the hair is soft and natural.</li>
            <li>she said it looks real and feels real just like her own hair.</li>
            <li>Luckily I ordered it through Amazon</li>
            <li>so i recently cut 15 inches off of my hair into a very short bob and decided it would the perfect time to play with wigs.  </li>
            <li>It fits great and the hair is soft and natural looking.</li>
            <li>My friends gave it a 3 out of 10, with 1 being the most realistic, in looks.</li>
            <li>it got super tangled and looked like a birds nest.</li>
            <li>Shipping was quick.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>This wig is good for the money I would have to say when know it looks nice and feels pretty soft its only my third favorite  wig would buy again :)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I made this purchase and highly recommend that you try one out.</li>
            <li>And the little box for the wig was high quality and nice, I love the cute light purple</li>
            <li>There is even a piece of flesh-tone flexible material at the very top of the wig in the middle, where the part can be seen, that makes it appear like hair is literally growing out of your head.</li>
            <li>and it touches the very top of my pants in back.</li>
            <li>Looks very real!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very pretty.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty comfortable.</li>
            <li>Cheap and good enough to look real.</li>
            <li>Very pretty</li>
            <li>This was my very first wig.</li>
            <li>It is very cute on even though I haven&#x27;t figured out how to wear it properly.  </li>
            <li>This was also my very first wig</li>
            <li>I put the wig on top of my normal hair</li>
            <li>Way long, and gorgeous.</li>
            <li>(From Cool 2 day-think that&#x27;s the name) and this wig was worth the purchase of both on</li>
            <li>I bought it for $18.88 which was well worth it, but I would not pay the full $39.99.</li>
            <li>this is a  gorgeous long hair to have.</li>
            <li>Pretty nice my only complaints are it tangles easily</li>
            <li>The wigs from the wig store shed so fast and tangle really easily.</li>
            <li>Much longer than I expected, and a beautiful shade of brown.</li>
            <li>looks real and easy to put on.</li>
            <li>No one can believe the transformation from my natural blonde to this beautiful brunette.  </li>
            <li>The only thing I didn&#x27;t care for was that it is so long, but that is easy to fix with a good pair of shears :)</li>
            <li>First off, I use this wig for daily use and I take extremely good care of my wigs.</li>
            <li>you get what u pay for , its pretty cute but it looks very wig like &amp; tangles &amp; losses</li>
            <li>Great price to get for a costume and high enough quality to wear out for fun.</li>
            <li>This wig is by far the BEST for the price hands down.</li>
            <li>Also a big plus are the curls, I&#x27;m in love!</li>
            <li>So pretty!</li>
            <li>I cut my hair short some months ago and while I love the convince (as a mama to three boys!)</li>
            <li>WASH FIRST!</li>
            <li>I bought one similar to this before and paid a lot more for it!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m definitely buying more wigs from this vendor!</li>
            <li>I wear this wig out in public, and love having it!</li>
            <li>I just wish they had this in a blonde or light brown, too!!</li>
            <li>Other then that, I can&#x27;t complain because it&#x27;s so nice &amp; affordable!</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this wig, its a nice long length and looks real.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a pretty rich medium brown.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m pretty excited.</li>
            <li>My first two friends couldn&#x27;t even tell I was wearing it!  </li>
            <li>This item was exactly how it was pictured!</li>
            <li>Quality is pretty good, and the wig actually looks and feels almost natural on me :)</li>
            <li>I have a slightly large head for a girl, and this doesn&#x27;t really fit.  </li>
            <li>If i ever buy another fun wig I will look here first!</li>
            <li>This wig is do fun and pretty!  </li>
            <li>The hair on this wig looks MORE realistic than wigs that cost five times as much!</li>
            <li>Thick and VERY good quality for synthetic hair.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t extremely perfect and shiny like you commonly see with synthetic hair wigs, the color has golden undertones, making it very realistic looking.</li>
            <li>Wow this Wig was so realistic and long and beautiful and flowy for just $20 !!</li>
            <li>Amazing, especially considering the price.</li>
            <li>, I wore it over a week straight just to ensure an accurate review.</li>
            <li>It is an amazing wig and is low price.</li>
            <li>Like really, it will tangle and if you try fixing it like brushing it with the plastic cheap brush it came with</li>
            <li>good quality, doesn&#x27;t shed, but the waves will get knotty easily so be careful...</li>
            <li>For the price this wig is amazingly worth it.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth it.</li>
            <li>Quality is as good or even better than much more expensive wigs that I bought online.</li>
            <li>worth every penny.</li>
            <li>couldn&#x27;t help but laugh and blurt out the fact that it was a wig.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Easily worth the $20.</li>
            <li>A fun wig</li>
            <li>At the very top, it has strange baby hairs, and I&#x27;m not about that either.</li>
            <li>It was definitely worth the price I paid for it</li>
            <li>and I think I will wear it more than just for Halloween since it really does look like real hair.  </li>
            <li>Lovely and natural looking</li>
            <li>Came in a nicely designed box, hair net and a wig comb</li>
            <li>I bought this wig just for fun.</li>
            <li>But it is definitely worth it.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth  </li>
            <li>The only thing that it&#x27;s nice is the color</li>
            <li>This wig is worth every penny.</li>
            <li>I love this wig, looks like natural hair.</li>
            <li>So worth the money.</li>
            <li>Worth the money</li>
            <li>Fun to dress up.</li>
            <li>Worth the money though</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s much darker and looks more real, but it could be shiny under the sun.</li>
            <li>all, it&#x27;s a wig worth</li>
            <li>But it will be worth it!l</li>
            <li>, I bleached it to death and just decided to shave it all off in an attempt to regrow my natural hair and have it be healthy again.</li>
            <li>It was way too long to look good on me at first, so I trimmed up the length a bit, and had to trim the bangs, too.</li>
            <li>Overall, it&#x27;s still nice.</li>
            <li>Bought for fun.</li>
            <li>Came in it&#x27;s own box in a ziplock back in a hair net&lt;br /&gt;Silky</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s so much fun</li>
            <li>and  is worth the price.</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t expecting such a nice wig for the price.  </li>
            <li>they hair was long and beautiful but It didn&#x27;t look natural on me.</li>
            <li>I tried it out in public and they thought I&#x27;d cut heavier bangs and colored my own hair.</li>
            <li>but if u can manage it totally worth the money brush</li>
            <li>It spent Memorial weekend on a boat with multiple people wearing it &amp; it still looks great!</li>
            <li>Even though the color was a little lighter than I thought, this wig is gorgeous and is definitely worth the price!</li>
            <li>Whatever, looks real, stays in place, easy to comb, curls are staying strong thus far.</li>
            <li>I received the wig in 4 days which was pretty quick.  </li>
            <li>I took a couple cute picks but more than anything it left me wanting to buy a high quality wig.</li>
            <li>One critique I do have is that to me it looked more like a chocolate brown shade in person, not really a dark brown.</li>
            <li>I figured if I get a wig, it should be as close to my natural hair as possible and this wig seemed to good to be true</li>
            <li>However, the hair looks pretty natural and is great for low pony tails and hairdos.</li>
            <li>Right now it looks like the cat had kittens in it.</li>
            <li>Right out of the box</li>
            <li>I bought this and got it right away.</li>
            <li>When I got it I put it on right away.  </li>
            <li>It was packaged and shipped right after I ordered</li>
            <li>Right out of the box</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m just going to stop right here and make a pros/cons list to save us both some</li>
            <li>just right</li>
            <li>and Talk about on time , they were right on.</li>
            <li>I ordered this wig thinking that the price was just right, and I could get a feel for if I wanted to try growing my hair out again (plus I would have something for Halloween).</li>
            <li>The color was also just the right shade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>And the price was right.</li>
            <li>you get the right products to work with it.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s right.  </li>
            <li>I got it in the mail right away</li>
            <li>My only problem is that I am new to the wig world and sure wish it came with better instructions.</li>
            <li>Great for everyday natural look although it gets tangled easily</li>
            <li>The only reason it isnt a 1 star is because it was actually really nice to the touch (at first...) and was packaged well.</li>
            <li>The wig is kind of small though for most people I think.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s pretty nice especially for the money.</li>
            <li>First time wig users will love the natural feel and easiness of this out-on-the-night wig.</li>
            <li>We brushed it out, but it gets knotted very easily.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is really a great wig, the texture of the synthetic hair seems so realistic compared to other cheaper wigs I&#x27;ve gotten.  </li>
            <li>I bought this for a halloween costume and it was actually really nice, perfectly matched my actual hair and felt less cheap than typical wigs.</li>
            <li>It lasts just as long as well--and at an amazing price.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I got this just for fun to see if I (natural strawberry blonde) would look good if I went brunette.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m getting another for fun;)</li>
            <li>So fun to wear and looks like real hair!</li>
            <li>It is really long and flows nicely.</li>
            <li>The hair is really long and sits nicely.</li>
            <li>Like most people, I assumed that high price equals high quality.</li>
            <li>I loved the color and fit enough, and for the price I think I would buy it again just to see if mine was just a fluke in getting so ratty and dry so quickly and give it another chance.</li>
            <li>The part was kinda eh, so I moved a little more hair to the bangs and it looks way better.</li>
            <li>Its worth the money if you have a big event to go to, but make sure you don&#x27;t wear it till said event.</li>
            <li>It was soft, but it tangled up very quickly.</li>
            <li>I just got it today, super fast shipping</li>
            <li>and it came super fast</li>
            <li>feel happy enough that if I can make it last a month I would buy another one to keep replacing it with.</li>
            <li>You can just follow the tips on the box to take care of your wig, which is professional and easy.  </li>
            <li>Pros: Super fast shipping...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice and long - has a pretty in-style look too.  </li>
            <li>Product arrived quickly and packaged very neatly.</li>
            <li>2 stars for quick shipping but the hair tangles so ridiculously much.</li>
            <li>I got my wig super fast</li>
            <li>It was better than wigs I&#x27;ve paid 90+ dollars for, I got it and was quite happy, I&#x27;ve never worn the wigs out of my house because they just looked fake.</li>
            <li>It tangles easily and the front edge doesn&#x27;t look natural on me.</li>
            <li>Also because its so full and real looking it gets HOT very fast.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so realistic that it looks the same as before, but healthy!</li>
            <li>I had the same one previously and I loved it, this time the one that came was frizzy at the top of the lining right when I pilurchashed it.</li>
            <li>It also comes with a special comb and skull cap to keep your own hair hidden underneath.  </li>
            <li>Looks very nice but tangles very easily and is hard to get back the curls once they&#x27;re lost.</li>
            <li>I love long hair so this fit very well.</li>
            <li>Wore for a Halloween costume as &amp;#34;Kim Kardashian.&amp;#34; It is very real looking.</li>
            <li>but all in all very real looking.</li>
            <li>It seems very real.</li>
            <li>looks and feels very real, I get tons of compliments with this hair.</li>
            <li>I love the way the bangs as they are easily combed down to cover an eye</li>
            <li>Not only is it incredibly affordable, but it looked beautiful and realistic (definitely not overly-shiny or dull)!</li>
            <li>The inside of the wig is much more comfortable than the other two I bought as well.</li>
            <li>It was so long, and tangles very easy.</li>
            <li>It is as thick as natural hair, styled beautifully, the bangs easily can be flipped toward wither side and the bang section comes straight forward in design.</li>
            <li>wig came very quickly and I couldn&#x27;t get it out of the package quick enough.  </li>
            <li>Do not brush hard and the wig looks great afterwards.</li>
            <li>and it actually looks much better.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my first wig, and everyone I&#x27;ve talked to thinks I got my hair colored / extensions.</li>
            <li>So they are all wigs ;-)</li>
            <li>exactly as pictured.</li>
            <li>The curls fell the first day i had it.</li>
            <li>I look so pretty now</li>
            <li>and i rather pay more for human hair then to wear this again!</li>
            <li>this was the first wig i bought on amazon after buying two at a wig shop in a city by me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I got my money back.</li>
            <li>and it even has tonal dimension that you see in real hair!</li>
            <li>just got this in the mail and it pretty and wavy</li>
            <li>it looks like real hair!</li>
            <li>First and foremost.</li>
            <li>so it looks better in a braid or low ponytail.</li>
            <li>but it looks like the real thing!</li>
            <li>Thank you so much!</li>
            <li>I have naturally straight hair, so having a bit of curls and length rocks!  </li>
            <li>and the curl fell out the first time I wore it.</li>
            <li>It is gorgeous and curly for the first few hours of wear, but I never wore it again after...</li>
            <li>This is a higher quality wig than what you&#x27;d find at a Halloween shop.  </li>
            <li>Only the roots not the top area,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Because it does look pretty and real-ish.</li>
            <li>Thanks again MelodySusie and Amazon!</li>
            <li>WASH FIRST.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the first wig I&#x27;ve ever got</li>
            <li>Best wig I have gotten so far it was thick and everyone throught it was real.</li>
            <li>But otherwise it&#x27;s pretty</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t wear it daily but more take pictures with it on.</li>
            <li>My only issue is wearing it so it looks ok.</li>
            <li>I can brush it and style it exactly the way I want.</li>
            <li>I purchased it for my Halloween costume and people thought it was my real hair!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really pretty hair, it looks real!</li>
            <li>is the first wig I have ever bought.</li>
            <li>Which I thought was pretty neat</li>
            <li>This is my first wig because my hair is rapidly falling out.</li>
            <li>This is my first time ever buying a wig.</li>
            <li>hair tangles pretty fast&lt;</li>
            <li>This wig is a lot of fun...leave everyone guessing if it&#x27;s real or not!  </li>
            <li>who dresser thought it was my real hair!</li>
            <li>I WOULD RATE MORE THAN 5 STARS IF POSSIBLE.</li>
            <li>Will definitely be purchasing more.</li>
            <li>When I first got the wig in the mail and put it on.</li>
            <li>I love this wig, I have never been a wig wearer but love the clips in back that you can adjust it to size it smaller.  </li>
            <li>It looks real to anyone who doesn&#x27;t know me without it!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fun &amp; glamorous, and looks real.</li>
            <li>Let me start by saying that, this is my first time ever buying or putting on a wig in my life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>color was pretty</li>
            <li>bit hot (USE THE CAP)</li>
            <li>A bit hot (USE THE CAP)</li>
            <li>I like the product, but it tooks like a real wig!</li>
            <li>Is comfortable and soft</li>
            <li>Be sure to only purchase from MelodySusieDirect.</li>
            <li>They are the only authorized sellers of Melody Susie wigs (which are of fantastic quality for the price!)</li>
            <li>First wig ever bought.</li>
            <li>This is the first wig I have ever bought</li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t itch nor feel hot under it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>this was first one ever..</li>
            <li>It was my first one.</li>
            <li>she can&#x27;t stop looking ing the mirrors I am definitely going to get her more</li>
            <li>Thanks a lot!</li>
            <li>so be aware that I am 5,7 and it almost went to my butt.</li>
            <li>This was my first wig &amp; I didn&#x27;t know what to expect.</li>
            <li>The volume can make it look a bit big, so a headband or one of those hipster beanies would make it look even better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve worn many different wigs of many different qualities throughout the years.</li>
            <li>The hair is extremely soft and the cap is really comfortable.</li>
            <li>but overall I love it</li>
            <li>This is the first wig that I&#x27;ve bought online and the first non-costume wig I have purchased.  </li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t have paid 17 bucks for it if I could have seen it first though.</li>
            <li>Looks soooo real!</li>
            <li>It was my first time purchasing a wig</li>
            <li>I have bleached hair and generally I love being blonde no matter how damaging it is.</li>
            <li>The only thing I didn&#x27;t like was it didn&#x27;t have any pins in it to make sure it doesn&#x27;t slip off my hair but overall satisfied.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Pretty color.</li>
            <li>The hair was stringy at first</li>
            <li>, it brushes out without too much of a headache!</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t expecting so much from this wig!</li>
            <li>This was her first wig.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good for a synthetic wig to be used a few times</li>
            <li>The wig itself was in really good condition, except for a few stray hairs, but nothing the comb couldn&#x27;t fix.</li>
            <li>She has no hair and we got her a locks of love wig and it was to tight and made her head hot this one is great no hot head</li>
            <li>Sure it tangles a little easy</li>
            <li>Great wig for costume or everyday use!!  </li>
            <li>I used the wig cap with the wig but really didn&#x27;t need it as the wig fits very snugly and comfortably but the wig cap can only fortify the fit, if indeed it is used.</li>
            <li>The length does not get in the way and the curls look very natural and full.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s why there&#x27;s wide toothed combs &lt;3 I would recommend this wig for anyone like me who just needed a wig for my job, i normally have pink hair</li>
            <li>in all, for the $18 I spent on my first wig, this was a great deal!e above:</li>
            <li>The part is a bit hard to design around but otherwise a great purchase and fast shipping</li>
            <li>I was really excited to open the box though when I received it today and nearly tore it apart and let me tell you I was not disappointed!</li>
            <li>It does tangle up a bit if you&#x27;re not careful but other than that a very nice wig.</li>
            <li>This is a great quality wig, I have had a ridiculous amount of compliments.</li>
            <li>and im loving it..its really soft..softer than i expected for the price.</li>
            <li>I was very worried to buy a wig online, but I needed a quick and cheap one for a sudden convention.</li>
            <li>Wig is great!I have had MANY compliments on it, the only downfall is that it snarls easily, but its no big deal!</li>
            <li>I always get told it looks very realistic and pretty.</li>
            <li>If you have a ton of hair, it will seem like there isn&#x27;t much on this, but I think that anyone who was actually losing their hair would LOVE this wig.  </li>
            <li>it tangles kinda easy though, only complaint, otherwise very nice wig</li>
            <li>For me, given the price, the extra wig cap and comb are like little gifts, and I thought that was really nice :)</li>
            <li>Pretty wig Bought for my sister and she really likes it</li>
            <li>It was very valumized stays on pretty well.  </li>
            <li>Used both long and styled in elaborate 1900&#x27;s up dos.  </li>
            <li>I do miss my lovely, long locks.  </li>
            <li>I cannot wait to go out on the town with my husband and my sexy, long hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is pretty much the bang for your buck wig.</li>
            <li>Fell in love with the long hair.</li>
            <li>this wig makes me feel really comfident and pretty.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping just as described thanks!</li>
            <li>Looks pretty much as pictured.</li>
            <li>Was very iffy at first, because of the price.</li>
            <li>Love the long side bang.</li>
            <li>This is the first wig I&#x27;ve bought, so I was really nervous.</li>
            <li>I was at first very iffy on buying this product.</li>
            <li>I usually don&#x27;t expect this quality from a synthetic wig, but this one is surprisingly natural-looking.</li>
            <li>Really surprised I liked this wig so much, because my hopes were low at this price!</li>
            <li>Purchased to dress up someone in the family for Halloween, we have found this to be of good quality for the small price we paid.</li>
            <li>It was soft and full.</li>
            <li>However, when left down, it looks pretty great.</li>
            <li>I was the maid of honor in my best friend&#x27;s wedding this past weekend, and I really wanted an affordable wig that would look realistic enough to help me blend in with the rest of the bridal party</li>
            <li>I think if you take good care of it, it can last at least a few months, which is very good for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was very surprised how real this looks!!</li>
            <li>I almost always wear it under a hat or something as it doesn&#x27;t look very realistic at the part.</li>
            <li>It was very realistic looking and not at all shiny.</li>
            <li>Easy to open</li>
            <li>I had my doubts, especially with a lot of reviews, but it&#x27;s quite covering and mostly easy to keep untangled if you follow the instructions and take care of it, even when storing.</li>
            <li>I must have a rather large head I guess (?)</li>
            <li>you have a large head, you may have to clip it on.</li>
            <li>Really like this wig,  looks real and you can pretty much part it wherever you&#x27;d like.</li>
            <li>If you take good care of it, it will last a long time!</li>
            <li>My wig came in the mail a few days ago and I absolutely love it!</li>
            <li>Only con was the color seemed a bit more dark than the picture, but that is ok.</li>
            <li>The only thing is, and the very bottom of the hair, it gets fuzzy and tangled really easy.  </li>
            <li>ditto for this wig as the short one I purchased so managable doesnt get tangly and dreaded easy to pick out gently</li>
            <li>It rarely tangles and it is very soft like real hair.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t even brushed it yet and it looks so natural! :)</li>
            <li>the only issues with it are typical of ALL synthetic wigs, and still much better than most</li>
            <li>I have recently purchased another wig in the same price category and it was so much better than this one!</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast and returning, I was a little concerned with, but they were so good about taking it back and money was refunded super fast.</li>
            <li>but it doesn&#x27;t really feel like human hair, which is fine by me..</li>
            <li>The box is pretty and high</li>
            <li>You certainly have to be careful with it; you won&#x27;t really be able to pull it up without the wefts showing.</li>
            <li>and it also gets tangled fairly easily, but both of these obstacles are easily overcome with proper maintenance.</li>
            <li>The down side is that it tangles very easily though.</li>
            <li>This wig was pretty long and fabulous.</li>
            <li>It was really really shiny and didn&#x27;t really look real to me.</li>
            <li>On another note, I was very upset at the fact that it does not seem to fit my head properly, and It wont allow me to return it, so I&#x27;m basically stuck with a wig</li>
            <li>but so does my real hair</li>
            <li>It looks so real</li>
            <li>It looks so amazingly real</li>
            <li>It was very trashy and looks like it was already worn a lot.</li>
            <li>Also, the hair looks so real.</li>
            <li>way better than i expected it to be.</li>
            <li>And washing it with wig shampoo made it really tangled.</li>
            <li>its very confortable and not at all shiny.</li>
            <li>or you can whisk them straight across the brow.</li>
            <li>It looks so real</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>Got knotty really fast.</li>
            <li>I had to trim the bottom of the wig cause it had to much curl to it</li>
            <li>I dont get that much shedding from it.</li>
            <li>and I am now getting ready to cut six inches from the ends</li>
            <li>too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t gotten a chance to wear it a whole day yet, so</li>
            <li>It looks like the one in the photo and lays very well.</li>
            <li>Very comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say much because of Amazon&#x27;s review policy, but I was infuriated..</li>
            <li>looks real</li>
            <li>Feels like real hair.</li>
            <li>I really like the color too.</li>
            <li>The wig isn&#x27;t too shiny and fits really well.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery.</li>
            <li>It looks like real hair</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s a real head-turner.</li>
            <li>This one looks real and lies close to my head.</li>
            <li>As the tips go on the box, the wig doesn&#x27;t need too much washing, and the any gel water or Vaseline should not be done to wig.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>As the tips go on the box, the wig doesn&#x27;t need too much washing, and the any gel water or Vaseline should not be done to wig.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s very quality for the price.</li>
            <li>Absolutely fantastic wig, especially for the price</li>
            <li>it just like real hair</li>
            <li>haha.</li>
            <li>The care instructions are also very helpful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I put this on and my friends thought  it was real.</li>

            <li>The wig feels so real</li>
            <li>Like this wig so much it doesn&#x27;t feel wiggy like some synthetic wigs.</li>
            <li>It looks and feel like real hair.</li>
            <li>I took it straight out the bag and put it on.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Looks and feels real.</li>
            <li>I wore it for 10 hours straight</li>
            <li>so will get another very soon. .</li>
            <li>curlys fast</li>
            <li>the clips in the back are supposed to make the wig fit snug on your head</li>
            <li>It looks like real hair, my boyfriend and his sisters both agreed.</li>
            <li>Way too much hair</li>
            <li>but this is my first wig, maybe that&#x27;s normal?</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s her daily wear piece, she said it&#x27;s comfortable</li>
            <li>this picture is very flattering, and perhaps i would benefit from learning to style wigs..</li>
            <li>Looks real, but I had ti trim the bangs a bit.</li>
            <li>and I have to say it really is all everyone is saying.</li>
            <li>While I doubt you&#x27;d fool anyone into thinking it is your real hair, it is a very high-quality costume wig.</li>
            <li>everyone thought it was my real hair.</li>
            <li>The curls were also very untamed.</li>
            <li>Who ever wants to buy this, do it.</li>
            <li>Way better then expected.</li>
            <li>Looks so real,</li>
            <li>It could pass for real.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>Wig came in fast, ordered April 12th, came on April 15th.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>wigs looks real, I like the color</li>
            <li>I recommend this to people who wants this wig.</li>
            <li>However, it was it much better condition than I expected.</li>
            <li>Absolutely haited it.</li>
            <li>it is WAY darker in real life than in this picture.</li>
            <li>in real life it is WAY darker..</li>
            <li>I was very hesitant on even trying to put my strightener to it because of the price I paid for this wig.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve worn both real and synthetic and paid close to $1000 dollars for a wig.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I was hesitant to purchase a wig online because I&#x27;m really picky and what a wig looks like on a stand isn&#x27;t always what it looks like on your head.</li>
            <li>Because this wig is so reasonably priced (and I can return it to Amazon if I don&#x27;t like it)</li>
            <li>It is so much like real hair .</li>
            <li>but it looks real a lot of people were asking me if I got extensions.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Looks and feels so real.</li>
            <li>This looks so real</li>
            <li>, our looks so real.</li>
            <li>The wig comb that comes with it, is very flimsy and does not work with the wig.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>I would suggest to put the wig on someone else&#x27;s head and light brush the wig starting at the ends.</li>
            <li>All my friends say it looks real.</li>
            <li>so I didn&#x27;t  really expect much from this synthetic hair...</li>
            <li>Plus shipping was surprisingly fast considering it came from across the globe.</li>
            <li>The wig is much better than I expected for the price.</li>
            <li>Very noticeable in front.  </li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>the wig looks and feel real</li>
            <li>it looks real</li>
            <li>I just cut it to a reasonable length.</li>
            <li>Plus the wefts are very visible if if you try to pull up sides or bangs.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t as much as wear it again after a month of buying it.</li>
            <li>The bangs were funky and didn&#x27;t look real.</li>
            <li>I own several pairs of hair extensions both human and synthetic.  </li>
            <li>I am currently hanging the wig to see if the curls will relax and hang more naturally.</li>
            <li>After a few wears I had used it for all it was worth -- then I cut it to a more manageable length</li>
            <li>The hair is beautiful, the only problem I had was it was too small for my head...</li>
            <li>I am a first time wig buyer and was scared to buy a new item I have no experience with.</li>
            <li>I had to trim it up a bit to make it look right but other than these few flaws, its a good wig to wear on a date/job interview/to school and is worth its price.</li>
            <li>pay.it was way to long and tangled way to easy and wig</li>
            <li>After reading different reviews I settled on this wig due to price and having good reviews.  </li>
            <li>Very soft, looks real!</li>
            <li>but otherwise it is more than I expected!</li>
            <li>Too volumnious and long and looks very unnatural, but would probably work for more dressy occasions but not everyday type wear.</li>
            <li>For the price this wig is better than the one I spent $200 on!</li>
            <li>part is a little funny, but nothing a cute head band or some distraction/styling can&#x27;t fix..</li>
            <li>Looks real, no fake shiny look, but the clips broke the second i snapped them together.</li>
            <li>Other than that I was pleased.</li>
            <li>Other than that I love it</li>
            <li>This was actually really cool, good quality, the only complaint is that is was way longer than I thought and</li>
            <li>I was really surprised with this wig, i wasnt expecting much, but i really love it, i had to cut it because it was very very long</li>
            <li>The hair is soft and pretty and depending on the lighting looks totally real.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have a realistic part, its very voluminous which adds a cartoony look to it, and its shiny.</li>
            <li>but the fiber irritates me because it needs serious maintenance for it to look good</li>
            <li>only drawback is that, like with any long hairpiece, it gets tangled quickly and easily.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s too long and too big to wear everyday &amp; tangles easily but will be a good costume addition.</li>
            <li>and it looked so beautiful just like in the picture and not like fake looking as i was expecting it to be.</li>
            <li>I got the curly dark brown and totally satisfied.</li>
            <li>Looks so natural on me and it looks exactly like the picture.</li>
            <li>Its more of an auburn vs. dark brown.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately I&#x27;m more of a dark blonde.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not a bad low price wig to try if you just looking for cosplay.</li>
            <li>Though it does tangle pretty easy but less now that I trimmed it.</li>
            <li>as described took a little while in the mail but nicer quality for a cheaper wig if you&#x27;re looking to start off with different with this is a good one</li>
            <li>However, I washed it and put four plastic hair curlers in it for a day and it is just like new!</li>
            <li>You can style it with loose clips, wear a hat or headband with it just fine.</li>
            <li>Hopefully the black one will be better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought better wigs for half the price.</li>
            <li>Definitely went above my expectations for a wig. :)</li>
            <li>Still fairly decent quality.</li>
            <li>My hair is short and blonde, and I love changing things up.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s better that I expected the hair is so soft</li>
            <li>This is a decent product for the price.</li>
            <li>Decent quality for the price.</li>
            <li>It also doesn&#x27;t look realistic.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s because the wig is super volumous and make your head big!</li>
            <li>On top of that, apparently this item is not eligible for returns (something that was not clear to me at the time of purchase).  </li>
            <li>One caveat: If you wear wigs daily, be warned: it dries it up quickly.</li>
            <li>But they only last for two months at most.</li>
            <li>I have very short hair because I love having short hair.</li>
            <li>With mine, it did not have the fake shine to it that most wigs have, and it has been able to keep</li>
            <li>Decent for the price.</li>
            <li>am no longer ashamed, and afraid that people can tell that my hair is not my own, and I even feel sexy.</li>
            <li>If it&#x27;s cut it to realistic length and the bangs are shaped up.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a decent wig.</li>
            <li>it got here quick enough</li>
            <li>When I wore it, everyone said I looked hot ^_^ it does tangle a little, but for me, it was easy to untangle.</li>
            <li>Pretty wig, shipped fast with prime, really long and pretty, gets lots of compliments.</li>
            <li>I was really excited about getting a wig with long hair.</li>
            <li>The only thing I am not used to is the bangs, but they are very pretty.  </li>
            <li>It took a bit of brushing to get the curls right, and it shed a bit initially, but I think any wig would, and it doesn&#x27;t shed so much anymore.</li>
            <li>Granted the part is a little bit of a give away if you&#x27;re up super close, but nonetheless very realistic :) The bangs were on the opposite side of mine naturally</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this brand</li>
            <li>Discription said high quality.</li>
            <li>High quality, plus extras ...wig cap and wig comb.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>would highly recommend this wig.</li>
            <li>You would never know the difference in price between a high end wig?</li>
            <li>This is a fairly high quality costume wig.  </li>
            <li>This wig looks so much more professional than some of the other wigs I have.</li>
            <li>I bought this originally for a cosplay but it is SO natural looking that I might end up wearing it occasionally!</li>
            <li>Wow!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments on this wig and people have been stunned by how little I paid for it.</li>
            <li>I would recommend it to anyone who loves the cute little girly look.</li>
            <li>I bought this wig with one that cost a little more</li>
            <li>so natural!!</li>
            <li>Looks even greater if you add a little tease for volume.</li>
            <li>i love the little face</li>
            <li>There was some light shedding and tangles (nothing a comb can&#x27;t fix), but my only MAJOR critique is about the bangs.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kind of hard for me to review this product.</li>
            <li>not too shiny not too dull nice color.</li>
            <li>Its a beautiful color, the only reason she gave it a 4 is it was a little long and had to trim it, but</li>
            <li>Just be very very careful with it because it tangles easily</li>
            <li>I do mean curls, the picture shows more gentle waves but large ringlets</li>
            <li>I was surprised at how real this wig looks.</li>
            <li>It looked real and it was soft.</li>
            <li>The shipping and everything was great, but this wig looked too fake on.  </li>
            <li>so this wig makes me look normal</li>
            <li>JUST A FEW IS OK</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not as full as it looks and it has some pieces that are way too long.</li>
            <li>all buzzed except for the top which is only about 5 inches long)</li>
            <li>I love this wig I wear it everyday</li>
            <li>I bought this wig b/c I thought it would be fun to wear occasionally.  </li>
            <li>Overall it&#x27;s a fun piece for the price.</li>
            <li>It states on the box that you shouldn&#x27;t use the comb for the wig as it isn&#x27;t a professional wig comb :/ nice gesture though.</li>
            <li>Although it could not be worn as one&#x27;s natural hair, it was longer and more natural than I expected.</li>
            <li>so it doesn&#x27;t look like a fake one, you can feel how soft and smooth it is when you touch it, just like my own</li>
            <li>For the ridiculously low price, it is extremely lifelike.</li>
            <li>amd wore it a few more times.</li>
            <li>It is a good wig for being silly at home, but I would not feel comfortable wearing it out in public.</li>
            <li>but that is not a complaint for me.</li>
            <li>The natural part of the hair is on a skin-colored piece rather than the mesh-looking lace, so even that looks pretty natural.</li>
            <li>so I just cut it to look like my normal hair.</li>
            <li>I like that it is nice and thick.</li>
            <li>The length is a little too much and the ends get tangled easily.</li>
            <li>Not even close to plastic looking, not much of a shine, large curls, avg fit nicely, waist length, and thick!  </li>
            <li>it is by far better quality than the synthetic wig i bought at the wig shop and the synthetic-human blend i bought at the wig shop and was $60 less.</li>
            <li>Only qualm, hair falls out easily when brushed</li>
            <li>My hair is dyed blonde right now and my hair doesn&#x27;t show through.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s long and curly, and looks super</li>
            <li>I t was super long when it came</li>
            <li>it is super long....</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s also really long too, very pretty.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t going to buy it at first because the low price made me skeptical but seeing all the great reviews and photos convinced me to get it</li>
            <li>The little cap can help collect her own hair and make it easier to wear the wig since she has a short hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s become my new go-to hair whenever I get done up.</li>
            <li>Through a bandanna or hat on or a bow and bam new look.</li>
            <li>so I could compare as I&#x27;m new to wigs.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new to wigs and I can&#x27;t figure out the parting</li>
            <li>I posted a picture on fb where a friend thought I was showing off the headband I was wearing not realizing I was talking about my new wig.. Just not liking the bang area yet.</li>
            <li>being said, my wig doesn&#x27;t look like the one pictured (the one that is pictured now is a new version).</li>
            <li>; Wont even give me a refund or resend me a new wig.</li>
            <li>Brand new.</li>
            <li>and I had to cut a few inches off because of the tangling and also cut the bangs for a more natural look</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s extremely soft, flexible and realistic looking!I waltzed into my living room to show my brother</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t worry about done because it&#x27;s definitely not aproblem, if it is for you just simply powder it or use dry shampoo, just as effective for me.</li>
            <li>I was very surprised when I got</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s very soft...</li>
            <li>Looks very natural.</li>
            <li>They both look very natural.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very soft and not too shiny</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice and long and has a natural shine as opposed to that weird look many synthetic wigs have.</li>
            <li>That being said, I also love long hair, and I&#x27;ve had my pixie-cut for a very long time.</li>
            <li>It is so soft and super long.</li>
            <li>The manufacturing of this product far exceeded my expectations!</li>
            <li>the only downside is that its parted funny</li>
            <li>Cheers to playing dress up as an adult!</li>
            <li>I used this wig for my first ever cross dress.</li>
            <li>I love it, I&#x27;ve never had hair past my armpit.</li>
            <li>next (: first wig I&#x27;ve ever owned ♡</li>
            <li>For a \\&quot;dark brown,\\&quot; it looks toooo light to me...especially in the light/sun.</li>
            <li>I guess it&#x27;s worth a shot, but I cut mine because it was so long</li>
            <li>The brown is too light for me as I have really dark brown skin.</li>
            <li>But I finally got one since it was so hot.</li>
            <li>All I can say is wow!</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised by this wig!</li>
            <li>If my friends didn&#x27;t already know that I have a bleach blonde pixie cut they would think it was real!</li>
            <li>Purchased to wear as part of a Halloween costume and people actually thought it was my real hair!</li>
            <li>I ordered dark brown and it came is light golden/caramel drown.</li>
            <li>This wig looks so natural!</li>
            <li>The wig is pretty but you will need to wash and comb it regularly to avoid rats and tangles.</li>
            <li>Only get this if you plan to wear it exactly as it looks</li>
            <li>so it looks like I have professionally dyed hair!</li>
            <li>I was worried about buying this, I buzzed off my long gorgeous blonde hair in a pregnancy break down moment</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments on it, and plan on ordering the long straight black one</li>
            <li>and I really think it&#x27;s a wig with high quality, because I found no stitches or lines in the root that obviously showed from the wig design.</li>
            <li>Other than that I would totally recommend this for first time users then try some extensions and full lace/front lace.</li>
            <li>it gets messy kinda easily</li>
            <li>Since this is my first purchase with MelodySusie, I may follow up in the near future for an update.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the exact same Colorado as my natural hair colour.  </li>
            <li>I had to wear my naturally long hair down with it to make it look more realistic.</li>
            <li>This wig looks and feels natural, and it&#x27;s so soft!</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to anyone who just wants long hair for fun, or for every day use for people like me with medical problems.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soft, flexible, the style is good but the bangs are a little mixed up with the long hair</li>
            <li>Very light weight but thick hair feel...</li>
            <li>Mine got so snarly and tangled at the ends and so dry after just one time of wearing it that I had to trim it right away.  </li>
            <li>anyway~ there is a comb and a cap in it, which may be the free gifts from the seller (and you&#x27;ll see that these little tools are so</li>
            <li>It was a little to light</li>
            <li>and I cut it a little to fit the frame if my face</li>
            <li>Wig also has an elastic closure at nape of neck against scalp that you can slip the little hook to customize tightness of fit if desired.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend, but I am a bit hard on my wigs and it lost most of its curl in the longer pieces.</li>
            <li>So I bought this wig cause my hair is super short and some days I get super lazy.</li>
            <li>Very high quality, especially for the price.</li>
            <li>If you want a natural, real looking wig, I&#x27;d definitely recommend this one.</li>
            <li>I was surprised at the quality of the wig.</li>
            <li>IT&#x27;S NOT SO NATURAL LOOKING WIG</li>
            <li>Delivery was also prompt.did not have to wait 4-5 weeks like some product wigs that are shipped directly from China.</li>
            <li>but that is some thing that can easily be fixed.</li>
            <li>The bangs are pretty long</li>
            <li>Wow.</li>
            <li>it was so soft and lasted longer than both wigs i bought at the shop.</li>
            <li>Color is natural.</li>
            <li>It made me completely self conscious.</li>
            <li>Will take some adjusting to make it look natural.</li>
            <li>looks natural</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s so soft</li>
            <li>WOW...</li>
            <li>so I wasn&#x27;t surprised.</li>
            <li>I just cut off 18 inches of my hair and really don&#x27;t like my short hair.</li>
            <li>I bought this wig for a Halloween costume, and was pleasantly surprised in the quality of the wig for the price.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Now my only real beef is with the color.</li>
            <li>Looks so real that my husband stopped mid sentence.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s natural and it could be quite well to wear it every</li>
            <li>It could be much longer than it looks like in the picture, I&#x27;m 5&#x27;5\\&quot; and it even goes to the bottom of my back.</li>
            <li>This is a great wig for occasional use, this wig needs a lot of care and the quality gets poor later on</li>
            <li>Received product midday a day early.</li>
            <li>Looks really natural.</li>
            <li>It was really soft too.</li>
            <li>He couldn&#x27;t even tell he said it completely changed how I looked!&lt;br</li>
            <li>After a few wears it does start to get a bit frizzy but some light combing does the trick.</li>
            <li>far exceeded my expectations for the price.</li>
            <li>Ive never worn one before, and I have ALOT of natural hair that has to be held beneath it.</li>
            <li>Most people seemed to think I dyed my hair, no one seemed to notice it grew at least a foot.</li>
            <li>I know this is really a problem for all of the wigs, especially the curly one and if not properly taken care of, it&#x27;ll tangle fast.  </li>
            <li>About cleaning and maintenance, I suggest that cleaning could be done about every 15-30 days, which is helpful to keep your wig glossy and soft, but not too often.</li>
            <li>And you know sunlight is kinda harmful to wigs, it need to be away from direct sunlight if you are not wearing it.</li>
            <li>And if you are a girl in the market of long curly wig, I really recommend this one for you!  </li>
            <li>The hair is soft...</li>
            <li>It is NOT as pictured and needs some finesse with the wig comb to make things look natural there.</li>
            <li>I may buy another one for when this one gets old.</li>
            <li>The only drawback is the front of it isn&#x27;t really what is pictured.</li>
            <li>Wow what a bargan for the money.</li>
            <li>and it looks really natural.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised when I received this wig.  </li>
            <li>Overall I really like it</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not for me but for a young girl..  </li>
            <li>It looks and feels so natural.</li>
            <li>I just received this yesterday, a day early.</li>
            <li>Hair extensions &amp; dye ruined my natural hair.</li>
            <li>This product is lightweight, not itchy, looks natural, and is adjustable to fit!&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li>ONLY concern is that it will wear out fast.</li>
            <li>It looks natural.</li>
            <li>So I completely re-styled and cut it</li>
            <li>It actually feels like real hair to me.</li>
            <li>I have had no issues with tangles so far.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>If it wasn&#x27;t so big it does look real.</li>
            <li>(One day I will go gray or be old</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s looks and feels natural.</li>
            <li>Soft, silky, lengthy hair.</li>
            <li>Looks and feels like natural hair.  </li>
            <li>but I was really surprised.</li>
            <li>feeling not heavy</li>
            <li>The hair is soft and does not tangle or get frizzy.</li>
            <li>If you wanna make it everyday wear, then I properly recommend a hat or some hair accessories to make it more realstic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>after letting it sit a few days to fall into shape, i was able to finally see the wig as it was meant to be.</li>
            <li>There are a few issues with it, but overall I really love it.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s thick at the top.</li>
            <li>The hair isn&#x27;t a shiny or fake looking so this would make a good every day wig.</li>
            <li>My hair is naturally long and blonde and I wanted to have some fun with something new.</li>
            <li>It had instructions for styling and washing, and it came with a black wig cap and a special wig comb.</li>
            <li>It seems to get knotted a bit easy, but with long curls it is to be expected.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a tiny bit darker than pictured, but that&#x27;s most likely due to lighting.</li>
            <li>It looks quite like human hair and feels soft as lots of review said, not like other cheap wigs I bought before,</li>
            <li>I have yet to wear it for a long period of time but was very surprised when my item arrived how real it looks.  </li>
            <li>Only downside is the shine which can easily be powedered down</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t seem to tangle easily, though it does come with a small comb.</li>
            <li>A bit shiny, not super full.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a cute wig; but is a little too long.</li>
            <li>The bangs are a little long but nothing a Bobby pin can&#x27;t fix. :)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d actually wear a wig that cost less than $20 in public, but when I put it on, I was stunned to see how convincing it looks!&lt;br</li>
            <li>The wig looks very realistic, it&#x27;s a bit long, but I&#x27;m having it trimmed.</li>
            <li>Usually, the wigs from the stores run me $40-$100, sometimes more depending if I want one made of human hair.</li>
            <li>Its so realistic looking there are even low lights and color to it.</li>
            <li>I have no previous wigs, hairpieces, extensions etc.</li>
            <li>but after cutting into a bob, it&#x27;s pretty nice.</li>
            <li>to my review: If you&#x27;re looking for an affordable and realistic looking wig I definitely recommend this one!</li>
            <li>A little full at the crown</li>
            <li>I agree with other purchasers that it does tangle easily but with gentle combing (it comes with a little, metal comb)</li>
            <li>i am a teen and in high school.</li>
            <li>While the actual hair feels real enough, the fit is akward and makes my head look and feel way bigger than it actually is.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend for those ladies who simply want to wear for a one night out with their friends...</li>
            <li>bangs can mess up quickly, so you have to adjust them..</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my personal preference, but I loved the length in the front (halfway down my chest) but the back was almost down to my butt.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit long, but it looks so real, that doesn&#x27;t even matter.</li>
            <li>The hair isn&#x27;t quite as long or curly, and the bangs are much longer.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this wig to anyone who wants long wavy hair.  </li>
            <li>I recently cut my hair short and miss long hair so much some days, I&#x27;ve worn this more than a few times out</li>
            <li>first off the wig was jammed into the box and when i took it out, i had to untangle it.  </li>
            <li>I wear this to work every day because I can&#x27;t walk around here with my pink hair (it&#x27;s too &amp;#34;extreme&amp;#34;).</li>
            <li>but I wanted a dark wig for fun.</li>
            <li>I thought it might be a little on the thinner side as you would see at regular party stores, and another reason was because of the cheap price.</li>
            <li>but it does knot easily and hard to brush or comb through...</li>
            <li>Even with little movement and a good combing through it would be tangled moments late.</li>
            <li>Dark brown doesn&#x27;t look right on me</li>
            <li>My biggest complaint is that it tangles so easily</li>
            <li>Still have the long hair, but just thinning on top, not a cute look.  </li>
            <li>I actually bought two of them, one curly, one straight, and I&#x27;m thinking about buying a 3rd one to cut shorter!</li>
            <li>I finally came back and read the reviews on it, and I figured for $18, it wasn&#x27;t too much of a risk to check it out.</li>
            <li>i LOOKED EXACTLY how my hair did when i was younger long and curly.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The pieces that are missing aren&#x27;t super noticable</li>
            <li>I love the wig it looks real c: although i hide the part with a beanie because it looks weird</li>
            <li>I liked the color (a dark cherry brown) and the texture (not cheap feeling!).</li>
            <li>However, I HAVE to wear it now because i have no other one...</li>
            <li>The color does NOT look fake, and I love it!</li>
            <li>It itches a little bit, but still is much better than other wigs I have tried</li>
            <li>I am a first time wig buyer and was surprised to see that it came three days earlier than expected</li>
            <li>It is very long (longer then normal natural hair)</li>
            <li>It was fun to do something a little different, and the wig looks realistic enough.  </li>
            <li>The curls are lovely, and it is very thick.</li>
            <li>I mean I look gay wearing it.</li>
            <li>feels realistic, and its very long.</li>
            <li>I even posted a pic on here on how it looks on me in general.</li>
            <li>I have a lot to say so bare with me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Came much faster than I expected.</li>
            <li>This wig has made me feel like I can be in public again without being self conscious.  </li>
            <li>felt very well made for the price and was money well spent.</li>
            <li>Having recently shaved my head for cancer support, I decided to go brunette (I am a natural redhead).</li>
            <li>first thing was how heavy the package was, but it&#x27;s not heavy on my head.</li>
            <li>The bangs are the most frustrating thing to work with.</li>
            <li>I initially didn&#x27;t like the wig because of this and because of how tightly curled it was, however, after trimming up the bottom layer and brushing it out, I ended up liking it very, very much!</li>
            <li>Please be aware that it is much longer than it looks like in the picture, in hits past my bellybutton!</li>
            <li>The whole wig is very long in the back</li>
            <li>my only complaint with it is that it tangles easily and the curls tend to fall out when you comb it.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s was fake, once you start brushing it gets ruined, &amp; it tangled way too fast an easily.</li>
            <li>I mean, it was a cheap wig</li>
            <li>Product is much to long and is far more curly then picture, and the lack of combs makes it very hard to keep on.</li>
            <li>I ordered this for a Halloween costume with pretty low expectations due to the price.  </li>
            <li>It is just as thick as pictured, and the curls are very pretty and natural looking.</li>
            <li>but no matter how loose it keeps sliding off the back exposing the real hair line.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this for post-chemo baldness and likely I will wear it on special occasions only, or braid it and wear it with a hat for everyday use.</li>
            <li>This wig laid flat and the bangs molded to her face naturally.  </li>
            <li>I was NOT disappointed in the least.</li>
            <li>I did have to cut the bangs shorter, and after wearing it long a few times I cut the back a bit shorter to fit my style.</li>
            <li>The shipping was fast for it being on the other side of the world and all, so no complaints on the wait here.</li>
            <li>I spent over an hour on amazon looking for a decent wig to go on a night out with my man</li>
            <li>but I thought it was a bit too long &amp; not very thick.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Quite possibly the only true complaint I have with this wig is that near the front of the hairline, you can see that it&#x27;s a wig.</li>
            <li>like it better with a beanie on to cover the hairline because I&#x27;m a little self-conscious but it might be different after a few cleanings too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I really like the color of the wig, which is really a dark brown, but I think it&#x27;s not that shiny as the pic</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s long and natural looking.  </li>
            <li>I love the color and everyone thinks it is my natural hair because it is so close in cold and texture to my natural hair.</li>
            <li>it is what I excepted long and soft...</li>
            <li>Not sure if I would buy again but absolutely worth the try.</li>
            <li>I have a full head of thick curly hair</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soft, super thick, heat resistant, super long, and looks SO real, little to no plastic shine.</li>
            <li>The wig comes just a little bit curlier than the picture, but the color and style otherwise is the exact same.</li>
            <li>I had to cut a lot of the hair to look normal, the front is hard to style and figure out how to hide the lining, and it gets very tangled.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s very long and soft.</li>
            <li>Very long, the look is natural, the feel is sub-par</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very long and looks natural.</li>
            <li>but I used some dry spay shampoo to dull it down and it looks much more natural now.</li>
            <li>I recommend this product to anyone just experimenting with wigs, it will last you a long time too if you follow the care instructions, but its nothing professional.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s thin and tangles easily, though.</li>
            <li>Not happy with this - has a strong chemical smell and NO clips/combs affix this to any hair on your head.</li>
            <li>Its true, it does get a little bit tangled, but use common sense and be gentle with it.</li>
            <li>in real life it looks almost black and with a hint of red in it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad the reviewer didn&#x27;t have any negative effects but typically heat melts synthetic hair.</li>
            <li>but it was unopened so no major complaints the part is a little funny</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very glamorous; long, long curly locks and very long bangs.</li>
            <li>The wig doesn&#x27;t have a funny smell to it at all, and it even comes with a little wig comb and a wig cap!</li>
            <li>and I just cut it for a little, and it looks like much cuter.</li>
            <li>I read a lot of bad reviews beforehand, and now that I&#x27;ve received this wig, I realize many of the negative reviews are from people who bought cheap knockoffs from unauthorized sellers!</li>
    </ol>

            <li> i am very pleased with the product quailty with the price I paid for.</li>
            <li> I believe i would be really happy with this wig had it come as many of the others described theirs.</li>
            <li> I believe this may just be a fluke since so many others have had great experiences with theirs.</li>

            <li> Very pleased.  </li>
            <li> I am very pleased.  </li>
            <li> it isn&#x27;t that good for it, so I use my own brush.</li>
            <li> Honestly,  I am a stylist and have no problem giving it a trim, but for the price you pay this wig is a good deal.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t get knotted up easy to brush just all around beautiful</li>
            <li> Fits perfectly well and there is even a strap to adjust the wig to fit your head better.</li>
            <li> the fit is perfect, the look is even better.</li>
            <li> It would be awesome if it had clips to make it more secure</li>
            <li> Also it tangles very easily and sheds a good bit as well.  </li>
            <li> The clip is nice and right and the bangs are the perfect length.</li>

            <li> Color is really nice too.</li>
            <li> Not itchy at all out of all the wigs I own thi s</li>
            <li> , I got it how I liked it.</li>
            <li> 2 get looking nice</li>
            <li> I am so thrilled with this purchase that 3 family members have already purchased it as well</li>
            <li> I did not expect a wig this nice for this price...</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s as nice as it is for the price.</li>
            <li> it nice but</li>
            <li> I wanted a wig, a nice wig</li>
            <li> when I sent the wig back I experienced some of the best customer service I&#x27;ve ever gotten.</li>
            <li> The length is a really nice length, too.  </li>
            <li> Looks awesome everyone thinks its my real hair.</li>
            <li> but my own fault for not washing beforehand.</li>
            <li> and I got say it again that it really could be the best one for this price!!!The color</li>
            <li> The hair itself is nice.</li>
            <li> It comes with it&#x27;s own brush</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s own mesh skull cap</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s own.  </li>
            <li> I have felt nice synthetic hair</li>
            <li> Nice curl to the ends</li>
            <li> so I really liked it in the beginning</li>
            <li> It was well packed when I got it, with its own box in the outer box.</li>
            <li> Almost all of our friends think it looks like my girlfriend&#x27;s own hair when she wearing it.  </li>
            <li> It has a couple bald patches around the crown area, and the bangs don&#x27;t seem to be in any kind of shape.</li>
            <li> are nice</li>
            <li> So I started using my own softening shampoos/conditioners and it kind of help.</li>
            <li> Really nice wig for the price.</li>
            <li> The color and feeling of the wig are nice.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my roommate, she liked it a lot.</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast too, very happy with my purchase!!</li>
            <li> My brother walked in and asked if I went and got my hair done because it looked so nice.</li>
            <li> The bangs were kind of tricky to fix.</li>
            <li> Nice product although wish it was fuller.</li>
            <li> , it fits perfectly, and looks/feels incredibly real.</li>
            <li> Color is really nice</li>
            <li> nice look</li>
            <li> The hair seems like nice quality but the bangs look like someone just chopped away at them.</li>
            <li> It looks nice, but the length makes it so that it just looks unnatural.</li>
            <li> Also to note that it includes a fish-net cap to hold your own hair into the wig.</li>
            <li> The hair itself was nice hoowever this wig looks nothing like the picture</li>
            <li> its a nice wig for Halloween</li>
            <li> The color is a nice chocolate brown and you can style and cut it if you need to.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad they included the comb I never would have bought one this good.</li>
            <li> Nice packaging - thankful to have the comb, cap, and care instructions in a nice box to keep it all together.</li>
            <li> Thrilled with this purchase.  </li>
            <li> Loving it.</li>

            <li> but it works for my purpose, and i&#x27;m really glad i bought it:)</li>
            <li> However, I think if someone was 40 feet away from me - or if you have a hat on top of it - they wouldn&#x27;t be able to tell that it is a wig.</li>
            <li> So many compliments on this wig</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an okay wig I guess.</li>
            <li> Very  sexy and full wig.  </li>
            <li> But if that is what your looking for then I recommend you buy it now. :)</li>
            <li> My husbad loves and and asked when I can buy more of them.</li>
            <li> and I love that it came so lond.</li>
            <li> It could be ok for a costume</li>
            <li> I would recomend this wig :)</li>
            <li> I love the wig</li>
            <li> I love this wig.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS WIG.</li>
            <li> Buy something better.</li>
            <li> I love the comb it came with</li>
            <li> and I love how it came with a wig cap also.</li>
            <li> You can even brush the top where the bang area is to get the bangs how you want them.</li>
            <li> I will deffinately buy more.</li>
            <li> Love the length &amp; curl.</li>
            <li> Cute but brown was not my color and also it felt plastic like which I don&#x27;t like</li>
            <li> I will do some research and invest in a wig that can be worn more then a couple of times before it has to be thrown away.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to buy more.</li>
            <li> And I have to say I love it.</li>
            <li> Just got it in the mail today and love it...</li>
            <li> and i think this ones better then</li>
            <li> It is a lovely wig for things like cosplay/modelling but out in the world, girls might call you out on it.</li>
            <li> i will b ordering 5 maybe 6 more</li>
            <li> Looks much better on than in the stock photos, but was everything I wanted all together.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with it :)</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe the price was so low for this great wig!</li>
            <li> eventually(which would cause more damage)</li>
            <li> I wish they had more lighter colors.</li>
            <li> I got so many compliments when I was wearing it.</li>
            <li> , they never considered it might be a wig. &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> I am going through chemo &amp; like this wig better than the $300 one that I bought.</li>
            <li> I ordered 3 more as backups :-)</li>
            <li> i was glad that i found this wig</li>
            <li> Love it...</li>
            <li> to style the top so no one can see the cap</li>
            <li> Will be buying more wigs from this vendor.</li>
            <li> But it served me when I need it most</li>
            <li> IT fits her well:) for $15 dollars its a steal.</li>
            <li> I had a great laugh when i originally got it/</li>
            <li> I love this wig and it&#x27;s very good quality, barely any strands have fallen out in almost two months!</li>
            <li> Nice wig has been easy to work with and restyling has been easy.</li>
            <li> Shipped fast, fits perfect and its adjustable and it feels real!</li>
            <li> it looks very realistic and nice!</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and I&#x27;m glad it did!</li>
            <li> I found it very comfortable and easy to wear.</li>
            <li> But for about $15 it&#x27;s a pretty good deal.</li>
            <li> It was soft and beautiful.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gorgeous and looks real!</li>
            <li> I am going to have so much fun with this!!</li>
            <li> and he thought it was real at first!</li>
            <li> wig is very long, and beautiful!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great fit and looks real.</li>
            <li> I sprayed it with dry shampoo to get rid of the shine, and it was perfect.</li>
            <li> Good for the price, but far from amazing.</li>
            <li> I also have a bigger head, and it fit perfectly, so that was a relief</li>
            <li> when opening i saw the items in the package and was very surprised and happy.</li>
            <li> Great product for the price and so natural looking!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just fun to change yourself every once in awhile, I wish more people would wear wigs!..</li>
            <li> The quality of the wig is beautiful -- with one major flaw.  </li>
            <li> It is however, a very good quality wig, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> real,,and is very full.</li>
            <li> Amazing, worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Pros: cute, cheap and affordable&lt;br /&gt;Cons:</li>
            <li> However, I feel like shorter hair would be able to fit.</li>
            <li> Make sure if you brush, brush your wig lightly and try to reform the curls it came with.</li>
            <li> It looks natural and even though it&#x27;s synthetic it feels great.</li>
            <li> I love the color and the fit</li>
            <li> Plus, it&#x27;s a great natural color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very cute on the first day then it got matted...</li>
            <li> Cute &amp; comfortable wig</li>
            <li> It is comfortable to wear and I love the style, everyone just assumed I had gotten extensions when they saw it</li>
            <li> Let me say this it would be great for a one time use like Halloween but not everyday.</li>
            <li> Great natural looking wig (unplastic looking).</li>
            <li> absolutely freaking loved this wig.</li>
            <li> Everyone keeps saying how good my hair looks, some people still think this is my real hair!&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Packaging:&lt;br /&gt;It came packaged nicely with a complimentary comb and wig cap.</li>
            <li> It looks real and fits good.</li>
            <li> : Do remember that it is a wig and that it does require special care, so take care of it well!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m gonna love wearing this in front of my whole school!!!</li>
            <li> This is a great first wig but there was a cap end hanging out right at the part</li>
            <li> curls were perfect but be careful taking it out because It does tangle easily, and the comb they provide doesn&#x27;t help.</li>
            <li> But other wise this products looks so real and feels amazing!&lt;br /&gt;Great product for this great a price!</li>
            <li> I am fully satisfied with this purchase and of course my girlfriend love it very much, thank you Melodysusie!</li>
            <li> It came in very nice, professional packaging.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice wig with flattering bangs and natural color.</li>
            <li> Other than my laziness to comb it after every use, it&#x27;s awesome!</li>
            <li> so I had to trim them a bit, but other than that the cap fits perfectly and the wig is straigtenable.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I have to comb the bangs just so, so the cap doesn&#x27;t show underneath, but it&#x27;s been easy to fix.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to take care if though it tangles easily.</li>
            <li> It does tangle easily though.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also really easy to style.</li>
            <li> and it was easy to manage and put on.</li>
            <li> Seems like an easy return.</li>
            <li> The package came to my house very quickly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 5&#x27;7&amp;#34; and it touched my butt and did tangle easily.</li>
            <li> But it does get tangled kinda easily, but please believe me, every wig gets tangled and maintenance is important!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It tangled easily.  </li>
            <li> Best wig I have ever bought so far it feels and looks real</li>
            <li> I recieved it very quickly, maybe 3 days after I ordered it.</li>
            <li> if I have to it looks like an easy fix.</li>
            <li> i think that it gets tangled way too easy...</li>
            <li> I am extremely pleased with this wig, it looks so gorgeous and natural.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so easy to style</li>
            <li> I can where this anywhere face and easy to maintain</li>
            <li> Once you put the wig, it is easy to swipe the bangs to the side or pin them up to the side which is what I did.</li>
            <li> , it doesn&#x27;t seem to tangle too easily either.</li>
            <li> October 6th item arrived October 11th was not tangled but tangles EASILY</li>
            <li> it arrived very quick to so yea.</li>
            <li> Would recommend to anybody and everbody, whether you wear wigs often or not since it&#x27;s such a nice, easy way to change your look and feel good about yourself.</li>
            <li> Youre better off buying real hair wefts and making your own wig.</li>
            <li> I was worried because I have a pretty big head, but it fit great! :)</li>
            <li> Valentine&#x27;s Day Best Offer - MelodySusie New Women&#x27;s Long Full Curly is nice wig, good looking and not expensive.</li>

            <li> This is the first time I have ever bought a wig, and so I was kind of iffy of it.</li>
            <li> I hung it upside down for a couple days and when I put it on it was perfect!</li>
            <li> However if I am going have to buy a new one every month or 2 is it good quality?</li>

            <li> and it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li> Even though it&#x27;s synthetic it doesn&#x27;t have that super wig shine like most.</li>

            <li> I loved the sexy waves but cut it to the middle of my back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very voluptuous but cute for the price :)</li>
            <li> if your looking for an everyday kind of wig get this one or Halloween its a great wig.</li>
            <li> It was super long - like to the top of my butt, but the great part is that you can trim it to whatever length you want.  </li>
            <li> The wig is indeed really pretty, but for starters, it does indeed tangle easily, so handle with care!</li>
            <li> it was nice the first day i got it but quickly fell apart and got all ratted.</li>
            <li> even my mom who isnt a fan of wigs and such said it looked gorgeous and realistic, and for only like 17$, very happy with my purchase :3</li>
            <li> You&#x27;d have to have a very small head to get this to fit you perfectly without poofing up from the top</li>
            <li> Very nice looking Enough hair to trim up to fit your style.</li>
            <li> Make sure you&#x27;re buying it from the right seller.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 5&#x27;4\\&quot; in height and the hair falls right on top of my bum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Beautiful... VERY, very long.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t get over how excited I am to find a cheap wig that&#x27;s fantastic quality</li>
            <li> and everyone thinks it&#x27;s my REAL HAIR!!!</li>
            <li> I love it, its a little shiny but wig shampoo takes that away and its wonderful for a first time wig wearer.</li>
            <li> Fit great and looks very real and classy.</li>
            <li> Overall I am very happy with this wig and it looks so realistic on.</li>
            <li> this is beautiful, and soft, and very realistic...</li>
            <li> This might not be something you would want to wear every day, but for a special occasion, it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li> High quality and very beautiful and deep color.</li>
            <li> I love the high quality this wig gives you for such a good price!</li>
            <li> This wig looks amazing and and incredibly realistic.</li>
            <li> but then again this is my first wig and loved it so much that I ordered others and have been doing research.</li>
            <li> All in all, for the $18 I spent on my first wig, this was a great deal!</li>
            <li> Melody was a nice wig the style was really nice, but the only thing is that it shed a lot and it matte up quickly.</li>
            <li> It does get super tangled easy</li>
            <li> tangles easily and is VERY hot to wear.</li>
            <li> I just gave it alittle hair cut and a real good deep conditioner to make the hair look brand new again.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s totally worth the money!</li>
            <li> The wig was okay at first but after having it on once it became tangled and unmanageable.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t speak to the issue of styling it as I plan to use it as it is, but it is exactly what I wanted for a better price than I could have imagined.</li>
            <li> Totally worth the buy!</li>
            <li> Love it looks like real hair and feels like it to!</li>
            <li> I originally bought this for myself, but ended up giving it to my sister because it made her feel like Miss America.</li>
            <li> This wig also is for small head shapes and that they provide an awesome comb and wig cap.  </li>
            <li> Really worth the money!</li>
            <li> Buy this wig you will love it as much as I do!</li>
            <li> Definitely worth buying!</li>
            <li> Well worth the money!</li>
            <li> Cool and comfortable.</li>
            <li> My friends always get excited when they see me wearing this wig and they all want to wear it.</li>
            <li> and once I opened the box I was so excited.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, definitely worth the price!</li>
            <li> We all think it looks beautiful, natural and realistic.</li>
            <li> Very thick, soft, natural feeling hair at a great great great price.</li>
            <li> I am loving my new wig.</li>
            <li> I would recommend if you are looking for a nice wig to wear every now and again:) or if you are like me and have a short pixie cut that you like to change up every now and again.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s more of a southern belle, kind of look.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t as curly as I thought it would be, but I think it still looks amazing since I mostly ordered it for the volume and length not necessarily for the curls.</li>
            <li> everyone thinks its my hair!!!greqt price..and super comfortable.  </li>
            <li> Super cheap.</li>
            <li> Many people thought I actually dyed my own hair.</li>
            <li> Totally unexpected, but I&#x27;m not complaining; I loved it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, considering the price, it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> With those adjustments done, this wig looks very natural and the waves are nice.</li>
            <li> And it will defiantly last a long time, make sure you take good care of it! :)</li>
            <li> This wig was super great, it is really long</li>
            <li> This is one of the most natural looking wigs available, and at such a great price.</li>
            <li> So I have a teal Mohawk which isn&#x27;t a great hairstyle for a professional career, so I decide to try out wigs to see if it was a worthy investment to get a real hair wig.</li>
            <li> It came with a wig cap and a special comb.  </li>
            <li> THE PRICE IS RIGHT!</li>
            <li> and I got it right on time !</li>
            <li> I will say the curls make it a little hard to comb out at the ends, but for the most part it&#x27;s the best wig I&#x27;ve ever own!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this wig it takes heat not to high frm cheap ceramic curlers  </li>
            <li> I do recommend buying this beautiful wig especially at this price, girls Halloween is coming!!!like much cuter.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s far from perfect; it&#x27;s way too long for example.</li>
            <li> Surprised how nice this is at such a good price!I have paid over 100 dollars before and it wasnt near as nice as this.</li>
            <li> Lol its the same colir as my real hair just longer and with bangs.!</li>
            <li> It makes me confident and feel very feminine.</li>
            <li> You could probably just throw something on it to make it more matte if you really wanted to wear it out.</li>
            <li> I have a full head of hair</li>
            <li> but the color is nice and the texture soft and silky.</li>
            <li> You definitely get a good deal for the price.</li>
            <li> While the color is true in the picture the style is not.  </li>
            <li> so I just pinned it back and it looked good that way</li>
            <li> but if you pin them back you can make them look really good.</li>
            <li> This wig is cute for dress up but does not look as real as I thought it would.</li>
            <li> I love this wig and the color matches my real hair.</li>
            <li> Like I said I like the style, but to keep this style a whole year and buy 6 more of them</li>
            <li> I love the feel of the hair, but it came tangled, and I am trying to figure out a gentle way of fixing that as well.</li>
            <li> True color&lt;br</li>
            <li> But I keep it moisturized with argan oil and keep it washed, brushed, and curled/straightened with heat protector to take good care of it and keep it from getting too tangled and matted.</li>
            <li> Overall good product.</li>
            <li> Talk about a good find at such an affordable price!LOVE,LOVE,LOVE!</li>
            <li> Overall good product.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s comfortable and fun.</li>
            <li> The wig wasn&#x27;t that full.</li>
            <li> The wig is a lot longer than it appears in the picture and not as full.</li>
            <li> this wig will definitely make you look good.  </li>
            <li> its not as full as in the picture</li>
            <li> Such a good unit for the price.</li>
            <li> it wasn&#x27;t as full as I thought it would be.</li>
            <li> I love it so much I bought it two times.</li>
            <li> But I love it so much that I bought it again</li>
            <li> Thick and Beautiful and just as described!</li>
            <li> It is a very flirty, sexy style.</li>
            <li> The service was good, so the company is not to blame, but I warn girls with larger heads that this will not work for you.</li>
            <li> , no wig is going to stay perfect, it&#x27;s just common sense.</li>
            <li> so that&#x27;s good enough for me.</li>
            <li> I took 6-7 inches off and gave it full bangs.</li>
            <li> Not bad for the price.</li>
            <li> not a bad purchase, descent quality.</li>
            <li> Very pleased, better than I expected.</li>
            <li> For the price, really Not bad at all.  </li>
            <li> It arrived QUICKLY, which is awesome, I was a bit surprised at how long the wig was on me, but nonetheless, I like it.</li>
            <li> Oh and it seems to tangle pretty easily, but when it does, it gives it that, &amp;#34;carefree, undone&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I feel that this is a bonus because it&#x27;s easy to cut it shorter, but you can&#x27;t exactly grow a wig out if you want it longer.</li>
            <li> Was pretty, tangled easily though.</li>
            <li> Really pretty fits well tangles a lil easy</li>
            <li> She has many wigs in different color and length but this one is the best ever, with its natural color and soft feeling.</li>
            <li> The wig I bought looks just like my natural hair, and looked great and natural even after trimming and gently combing (be sure to start combing from the bottom of the wig and work your way up towards the roots to avoid excess tangles.)</li>
            <li> Very realistic, I was thrilled when someone thought it was my real hair</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this to anyone who wants a cheap but nice wig!</li>
            <li> A very good product, complete with hair net.</li>
            <li> But once I trimmed it, it looks much more realistic and is easier to manage.</li>
            <li> Pretty sweet deal for being that cheap, though.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased more realistic looking wigs at Halloween express.</li>
            <li> The top layers are very short, around shoulder length, which gives the hair a lot of texture, which is favorable to many.</li>
            <li> It arrived quickly and neatly packaged.</li>
            <li> shipping quick</li>
            <li> return was quick and easy.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li> for a quick selfie.</li>
            <li> It&#x27; really amazing to me that the seller sent these for free as my girlfriend always needs to buy the extra the wig cap since these no cap of the wig she bought before.</li>
            <li> However, based on the reviews I was expecting something with a more realistic feel.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really cute in a low pony tail, and the length was not outrageous</li>
            <li> but it gets tangled way to quickly</li>
            <li> This is a great product, the feel of the hair is soft and natural.</li>
            <li> she said it looks real and feels real just like her own hair.</li>
            <li> Luckily I ordered it through Amazon</li>
            <li> so i recently cut 15 inches off of my hair into a very short bob and decided it would the perfect time to play with wigs.  </li>
            <li> It fits great and the hair is soft and natural looking.</li>
            <li> My friends gave it a 3 out of 10, with 1 being the most realistic, in looks.</li>
            <li> it got super tangled and looked like a birds nest.</li>
            <li> Shipping was quick.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> This wig is good for the money I would have to say when know it looks nice and feels pretty soft its only my third favorite  wig would buy again :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I made this purchase and highly recommend that you try one out.</li>
            <li> And the little box for the wig was high quality and nice, I love the cute light purple</li>
            <li> There is even a piece of flesh-tone flexible material at the very top of the wig in the middle, where the part can be seen, that makes it appear like hair is literally growing out of your head.</li>
            <li> and it touches the very top of my pants in back.</li>
            <li> Looks very real!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very pretty.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty comfortable.</li>
            <li> Cheap and good enough to look real.</li>
            <li> Very pretty</li>
            <li> This was my very first wig.</li>
            <li> It is very cute on even though I haven&#x27;t figured out how to wear it properly.  </li>
            <li> This was also my very first wig</li>
            <li> I put the wig on top of my normal hair</li>
            <li> Way long, and gorgeous.</li>
            <li> (From Cool 2 day-think that&#x27;s the name) and this wig was worth the purchase of both on</li>
            <li> I bought it for $18.88 which was well worth it, but I would not pay the full $39.99.</li>
            <li> this is a  gorgeous long hair to have.</li>
            <li> Pretty nice my only complaints are it tangles easily</li>
            <li> The wigs from the wig store shed so fast and tangle really easily.</li>
            <li> Much longer than I expected, and a beautiful shade of brown.</li>
            <li> looks real and easy to put on.</li>
            <li> No one can believe the transformation from my natural blonde to this beautiful brunette.  </li>
            <li> The only thing I didn&#x27;t care for was that it is so long, but that is easy to fix with a good pair of shears :)</li>
            <li> First off, I use this wig for daily use and I take extremely good care of my wigs.</li>
            <li> you get what u pay for , its pretty cute but it looks very wig like &amp; tangles &amp; losses</li>
            <li> Great price to get for a costume and high enough quality to wear out for fun.</li>
            <li> This wig is by far the BEST for the price hands down.</li>
            <li> Also a big plus are the curls, I&#x27;m in love!</li>
            <li> So pretty!</li>
            <li> I cut my hair short some months ago and while I love the convince (as a mama to three boys!)</li>
            <li> WASH FIRST!</li>
            <li> I bought one similar to this before and paid a lot more for it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m definitely buying more wigs from this vendor!</li>
            <li> I wear this wig out in public, and love having it!</li>
            <li> I just wish they had this in a blonde or light brown, too!!</li>
            <li> Other then that, I can&#x27;t complain because it&#x27;s so nice &amp; affordable!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this wig, its a nice long length and looks real.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a pretty rich medium brown.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m pretty excited.</li>
            <li> My first two friends couldn&#x27;t even tell I was wearing it!  </li>
            <li> This item was exactly how it was pictured!</li>
            <li> Quality is pretty good, and the wig actually looks and feels almost natural on me :)</li>
            <li> I have a slightly large head for a girl, and this doesn&#x27;t really fit.  </li>
            <li> If i ever buy another fun wig I will look here first!</li>
            <li> This wig is do fun and pretty!  </li>
            <li> The hair on this wig looks MORE realistic than wigs that cost five times as much!</li>
            <li> Thick and VERY good quality for synthetic hair.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t extremely perfect and shiny like you commonly see with synthetic hair wigs, the color has golden undertones, making it very realistic looking.</li>
            <li> Wow this Wig was so realistic and long and beautiful and flowy for just $20 !!</li>
            <li> Amazing, especially considering the price.</li>
            <li> , I wore it over a week straight just to ensure an accurate review.</li>
            <li> It is an amazing wig and is low price.</li>
            <li> Like really, it will tangle and if you try fixing it like brushing it with the plastic cheap brush it came with</li>
            <li> good quality, doesn&#x27;t shed, but the waves will get knotty easily so be careful...</li>
            <li> For the price this wig is amazingly worth it.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> Quality is as good or even better than much more expensive wigs that I bought online.</li>
            <li> worth every penny.</li>
            <li> couldn&#x27;t help but laugh and blurt out the fact that it was a wig.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Easily worth the $20.</li>
            <li> A fun wig</li>
            <li> At the very top, it has strange baby hairs, and I&#x27;m not about that either.</li>
            <li> It was definitely worth the price I paid for it</li>
            <li> and I think I will wear it more than just for Halloween since it really does look like real hair.  </li>
            <li> Lovely and natural looking</li>
            <li> Came in a nicely designed box, hair net and a wig comb</li>
            <li> I bought this wig just for fun.</li>
            <li> But it is definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth  </li>
            <li> The only thing that it&#x27;s nice is the color</li>
            <li> This wig is worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I love this wig, looks like natural hair.</li>
            <li> So worth the money.</li>
            <li> Worth the money</li>
            <li> Fun to dress up.</li>
            <li> Worth the money though</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s much darker and looks more real, but it could be shiny under the sun.</li>
            <li> all, it&#x27;s a wig worth</li>
            <li> But it will be worth it!l</li>
            <li> , I bleached it to death and just decided to shave it all off in an attempt to regrow my natural hair and have it be healthy again.</li>
            <li> It was way too long to look good on me at first, so I trimmed up the length a bit, and had to trim the bangs, too.</li>
            <li> Overall, it&#x27;s still nice.</li>
            <li> Bought for fun.</li>
            <li> Came in it&#x27;s own box in a ziplock back in a hair net&lt;br /&gt;Silky</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s so much fun</li>
            <li> and  is worth the price.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t expecting such a nice wig for the price.  </li>
            <li> they hair was long and beautiful but It didn&#x27;t look natural on me.</li>
            <li> I tried it out in public and they thought I&#x27;d cut heavier bangs and colored my own hair.</li>
            <li> but if u can manage it totally worth the money brush</li>
            <li> It spent Memorial weekend on a boat with multiple people wearing it &amp; it still looks great!</li>
            <li> Even though the color was a little lighter than I thought, this wig is gorgeous and is definitely worth the price!</li>
            <li> Whatever, looks real, stays in place, easy to comb, curls are staying strong thus far.</li>
            <li> I received the wig in 4 days which was pretty quick.  </li>
            <li> I took a couple cute picks but more than anything it left me wanting to buy a high quality wig.</li>
            <li> One critique I do have is that to me it looked more like a chocolate brown shade in person, not really a dark brown.</li>
            <li> I figured if I get a wig, it should be as close to my natural hair as possible and this wig seemed to good to be true</li>
            <li> However, the hair looks pretty natural and is great for low pony tails and hairdos.</li>
            <li> Right now it looks like the cat had kittens in it.</li>
            <li> Right out of the box</li>
            <li> I bought this and got it right away.</li>
            <li> When I got it I put it on right away.  </li>
            <li> It was packaged and shipped right after I ordered</li>
            <li> Right out of the box</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m just going to stop right here and make a pros/cons list to save us both some</li>
            <li> just right</li>
            <li> and Talk about on time , they were right on.</li>
            <li> I ordered this wig thinking that the price was just right, and I could get a feel for if I wanted to try growing my hair out again (plus I would have something for Halloween).</li>
            <li> The color was also just the right shade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And the price was right.</li>
            <li> you get the right products to work with it.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s right.  </li>
            <li> I got it in the mail right away</li>
            <li> My only problem is that I am new to the wig world and sure wish it came with better instructions.</li>
            <li> Great for everyday natural look although it gets tangled easily</li>
            <li> The only reason it isnt a 1 star is because it was actually really nice to the touch (at first...) and was packaged well.</li>
            <li> The wig is kind of small though for most people I think.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s pretty nice especially for the money.</li>
            <li> First time wig users will love the natural feel and easiness of this out-on-the-night wig.</li>
            <li> We brushed it out, but it gets knotted very easily.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is really a great wig, the texture of the synthetic hair seems so realistic compared to other cheaper wigs I&#x27;ve gotten.  </li>
            <li> I bought this for a halloween costume and it was actually really nice, perfectly matched my actual hair and felt less cheap than typical wigs.</li>
            <li> It lasts just as long as well--and at an amazing price.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I got this just for fun to see if I (natural strawberry blonde) would look good if I went brunette.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m getting another for fun;)</li>
            <li> So fun to wear and looks like real hair!</li>
            <li> It is really long and flows nicely.</li>
            <li> The hair is really long and sits nicely.</li>
            <li> Like most people, I assumed that high price equals high quality.</li>
            <li> I loved the color and fit enough, and for the price I think I would buy it again just to see if mine was just a fluke in getting so ratty and dry so quickly and give it another chance.</li>
            <li> The part was kinda eh, so I moved a little more hair to the bangs and it looks way better.</li>
            <li> Its worth the money if you have a big event to go to, but make sure you don&#x27;t wear it till said event.</li>
            <li> It was soft, but it tangled up very quickly.</li>
            <li> I just got it today, super fast shipping</li>
            <li> and it came super fast</li>
            <li> feel happy enough that if I can make it last a month I would buy another one to keep replacing it with.</li>
            <li> You can just follow the tips on the box to take care of your wig, which is professional and easy.  </li>
            <li> Pros: Super fast shipping...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice and long - has a pretty in-style look too.  </li>
            <li> Product arrived quickly and packaged very neatly.</li>
            <li> 2 stars for quick shipping but the hair tangles so ridiculously much.</li>
            <li> I got my wig super fast</li>
            <li> It was better than wigs I&#x27;ve paid 90+ dollars for, I got it and was quite happy, I&#x27;ve never worn the wigs out of my house because they just looked fake.</li>
            <li> It tangles easily and the front edge doesn&#x27;t look natural on me.</li>
            <li> Also because its so full and real looking it gets HOT very fast.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so realistic that it looks the same as before, but healthy!</li>
            <li> I had the same one previously and I loved it, this time the one that came was frizzy at the top of the lining right when I pilurchashed it.</li>
            <li> It also comes with a special comb and skull cap to keep your own hair hidden underneath.  </li>
            <li> Looks very nice but tangles very easily and is hard to get back the curls once they&#x27;re lost.</li>
            <li> I love long hair so this fit very well.</li>
            <li> Wore for a Halloween costume as &amp;#34;Kim Kardashian.&amp;#34; It is very real looking.</li>
            <li> but all in all very real looking.</li>
            <li> It seems very real.</li>
            <li> looks and feels very real, I get tons of compliments with this hair.</li>
            <li> I love the way the bangs as they are easily combed down to cover an eye</li>
            <li> Not only is it incredibly affordable, but it looked beautiful and realistic (definitely not overly-shiny or dull)!</li>
            <li> The inside of the wig is much more comfortable than the other two I bought as well.</li>
            <li> It was so long, and tangles very easy.</li>
            <li> It is as thick as natural hair, styled beautifully, the bangs easily can be flipped toward wither side and the bang section comes straight forward in design.</li>
            <li> wig came very quickly and I couldn&#x27;t get it out of the package quick enough.  </li>
            <li> Do not brush hard and the wig looks great afterwards.</li>
            <li> and it actually looks much better.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my first wig, and everyone I&#x27;ve talked to thinks I got my hair colored / extensions.</li>
            <li> So they are all wigs ;-)</li>
            <li> exactly as pictured.</li>
            <li> The curls fell the first day i had it.</li>
            <li> I look so pretty now</li>
            <li> and i rather pay more for human hair then to wear this again!</li>
            <li> this was the first wig i bought on amazon after buying two at a wig shop in a city by me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I got my money back.</li>
            <li> and it even has tonal dimension that you see in real hair!</li>
            <li> just got this in the mail and it pretty and wavy</li>
            <li> it looks like real hair!</li>
            <li> First and foremost.</li>
            <li> so it looks better in a braid or low ponytail.</li>
            <li> but it looks like the real thing!</li>
            <li> Thank you so much!</li>
            <li> I have naturally straight hair, so having a bit of curls and length rocks!  </li>
            <li> and the curl fell out the first time I wore it.</li>
            <li> It is gorgeous and curly for the first few hours of wear, but I never wore it again after...</li>
            <li> This is a higher quality wig than what you&#x27;d find at a Halloween shop.  </li>
            <li> Only the roots not the top area,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Because it does look pretty and real-ish.</li>
            <li> Thanks again MelodySusie and Amazon!</li>
            <li> WASH FIRST.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the first wig I&#x27;ve ever got</li>
            <li> Best wig I have gotten so far it was thick and everyone throught it was real.</li>
            <li> But otherwise it&#x27;s pretty</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wear it daily but more take pictures with it on.</li>
            <li> My only issue is wearing it so it looks ok.</li>
            <li> I can brush it and style it exactly the way I want.</li>
            <li> I purchased it for my Halloween costume and people thought it was my real hair!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really pretty hair, it looks real!</li>
            <li> is the first wig I have ever bought.</li>
            <li> Which I thought was pretty neat</li>
            <li> This is my first wig because my hair is rapidly falling out.</li>
            <li> This is my first time ever buying a wig.</li>
            <li> hair tangles pretty fast&lt;</li>
            <li> This wig is a lot of fun...leave everyone guessing if it&#x27;s real or not!  </li>
            <li> who dresser thought it was my real hair!</li>
            <li> I WOULD RATE MORE THAN 5 STARS IF POSSIBLE.</li>
            <li> Will definitely be purchasing more.</li>
            <li> When I first got the wig in the mail and put it on.</li>
            <li> I love this wig, I have never been a wig wearer but love the clips in back that you can adjust it to size it smaller.  </li>
            <li> It looks real to anyone who doesn&#x27;t know me without it!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fun &amp; glamorous, and looks real.</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying that, this is my first time ever buying or putting on a wig in my life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> color was pretty</li>
            <li> bit hot (USE THE CAP)</li>
            <li> A bit hot (USE THE CAP)</li>
            <li> I like the product, but it tooks like a real wig!</li>
            <li> Is comfortable and soft</li>
            <li> Be sure to only purchase from MelodySusieDirect.</li>
            <li> They are the only authorized sellers of Melody Susie wigs (which are of fantastic quality for the price!)</li>
            <li> First wig ever bought.</li>
            <li> This is the first wig I have ever bought</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t itch nor feel hot under it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> this was first one ever..</li>
            <li> It was my first one.</li>
            <li> she can&#x27;t stop looking ing the mirrors I am definitely going to get her more</li>
            <li> Thanks a lot!</li>
            <li> so be aware that I am 5,7 and it almost went to my butt.</li>
            <li> This was my first wig &amp; I didn&#x27;t know what to expect.</li>
            <li> The volume can make it look a bit big, so a headband or one of those hipster beanies would make it look even better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve worn many different wigs of many different qualities throughout the years.</li>
            <li> The hair is extremely soft and the cap is really comfortable.</li>
            <li> but overall I love it</li>
            <li> This is the first wig that I&#x27;ve bought online and the first non-costume wig I have purchased.  </li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t have paid 17 bucks for it if I could have seen it first though.</li>
            <li> Looks soooo real!</li>
            <li> It was my first time purchasing a wig</li>
            <li> I have bleached hair and generally I love being blonde no matter how damaging it is.</li>
            <li> The only thing I didn&#x27;t like was it didn&#x27;t have any pins in it to make sure it doesn&#x27;t slip off my hair but overall satisfied.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> Pretty color.</li>
            <li> The hair was stringy at first</li>
            <li> , it brushes out without too much of a headache!</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting so much from this wig!</li>
            <li> This was her first wig.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good for a synthetic wig to be used a few times</li>
            <li> The wig itself was in really good condition, except for a few stray hairs, but nothing the comb couldn&#x27;t fix.</li>
            <li> She has no hair and we got her a locks of love wig and it was to tight and made her head hot this one is great no hot head</li>
            <li> Sure it tangles a little easy</li>
            <li> Great wig for costume or everyday use!!  </li>
            <li> I used the wig cap with the wig but really didn&#x27;t need it as the wig fits very snugly and comfortably but the wig cap can only fortify the fit, if indeed it is used.</li>
            <li> The length does not get in the way and the curls look very natural and full.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s why there&#x27;s wide toothed combs &lt;3 I would recommend this wig for anyone like me who just needed a wig for my job, i normally have pink hair</li>
            <li> in all, for the $18 I spent on my first wig, this was a great deal!e above:</li>
            <li> The part is a bit hard to design around but otherwise a great purchase and fast shipping</li>
            <li> I was really excited to open the box though when I received it today and nearly tore it apart and let me tell you I was not disappointed!</li>
            <li> It does tangle up a bit if you&#x27;re not careful but other than that a very nice wig.</li>
            <li> This is a great quality wig, I have had a ridiculous amount of compliments.</li>
            <li> and im loving it..its really soft..softer than i expected for the price.</li>
            <li> I was very worried to buy a wig online, but I needed a quick and cheap one for a sudden convention.</li>
            <li> Wig is great!I have had MANY compliments on it, the only downfall is that it snarls easily, but its no big deal!</li>
            <li> I always get told it looks very realistic and pretty.</li>
            <li> If you have a ton of hair, it will seem like there isn&#x27;t much on this, but I think that anyone who was actually losing their hair would LOVE this wig.  </li>
            <li> it tangles kinda easy though, only complaint, otherwise very nice wig</li>
            <li> For me, given the price, the extra wig cap and comb are like little gifts, and I thought that was really nice :)</li>
            <li> Pretty wig Bought for my sister and she really likes it</li>
            <li> It was very valumized stays on pretty well.  </li>
            <li> Used both long and styled in elaborate 1900&#x27;s up dos.  </li>
            <li> I do miss my lovely, long locks.  </li>
            <li> I cannot wait to go out on the town with my husband and my sexy, long hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is pretty much the bang for your buck wig.</li>
            <li> Fell in love with the long hair.</li>
            <li> this wig makes me feel really comfident and pretty.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping just as described thanks!</li>
            <li> Looks pretty much as pictured.</li>
            <li> Was very iffy at first, because of the price.</li>
            <li> Love the long side bang.</li>
            <li> This is the first wig I&#x27;ve bought, so I was really nervous.</li>
            <li> I was at first very iffy on buying this product.</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t expect this quality from a synthetic wig, but this one is surprisingly natural-looking.</li>
            <li> Really surprised I liked this wig so much, because my hopes were low at this price!</li>
            <li> Purchased to dress up someone in the family for Halloween, we have found this to be of good quality for the small price we paid.</li>
            <li> It was soft and full.</li>
            <li> However, when left down, it looks pretty great.</li>
            <li> I was the maid of honor in my best friend&#x27;s wedding this past weekend, and I really wanted an affordable wig that would look realistic enough to help me blend in with the rest of the bridal party</li>
            <li> I think if you take good care of it, it can last at least a few months, which is very good for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was very surprised how real this looks!!</li>
            <li> I almost always wear it under a hat or something as it doesn&#x27;t look very realistic at the part.</li>
            <li> It was very realistic looking and not at all shiny.</li>
            <li> Easy to open</li>
            <li> I had my doubts, especially with a lot of reviews, but it&#x27;s quite covering and mostly easy to keep untangled if you follow the instructions and take care of it, even when storing.</li>
            <li> I must have a rather large head I guess (?)</li>
            <li> you have a large head, you may have to clip it on.</li>
            <li> Really like this wig,  looks real and you can pretty much part it wherever you&#x27;d like.</li>
            <li> If you take good care of it, it will last a long time!</li>
            <li> My wig came in the mail a few days ago and I absolutely love it!</li>
            <li> Only con was the color seemed a bit more dark than the picture, but that is ok.</li>
            <li> The only thing is, and the very bottom of the hair, it gets fuzzy and tangled really easy.  </li>
            <li> ditto for this wig as the short one I purchased so managable doesnt get tangly and dreaded easy to pick out gently</li>
            <li> It rarely tangles and it is very soft like real hair.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t even brushed it yet and it looks so natural! :)</li>
            <li> the only issues with it are typical of ALL synthetic wigs, and still much better than most</li>
            <li> I have recently purchased another wig in the same price category and it was so much better than this one!</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast and returning, I was a little concerned with, but they were so good about taking it back and money was refunded super fast.</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t really feel like human hair, which is fine by me..</li>
            <li> The box is pretty and high</li>
            <li> You certainly have to be careful with it; you won&#x27;t really be able to pull it up without the wefts showing.</li>
            <li> and it also gets tangled fairly easily, but both of these obstacles are easily overcome with proper maintenance.</li>
            <li> The down side is that it tangles very easily though.</li>
            <li> This wig was pretty long and fabulous.</li>
            <li> It was really really shiny and didn&#x27;t really look real to me.</li>
            <li> On another note, I was very upset at the fact that it does not seem to fit my head properly, and It wont allow me to return it, so I&#x27;m basically stuck with a wig</li>
            <li> but so does my real hair</li>
            <li> It looks so real</li>
            <li> It looks so amazingly real</li>
            <li> It was very trashy and looks like it was already worn a lot.</li>
            <li> Also, the hair looks so real.</li>
            <li> way better than i expected it to be.</li>
            <li> And washing it with wig shampoo made it really tangled.</li>
            <li> its very confortable and not at all shiny.</li>
            <li> or you can whisk them straight across the brow.</li>
            <li> It looks so real</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Got knotty really fast.</li>
            <li> I had to trim the bottom of the wig cause it had to much curl to it</li>
            <li> I dont get that much shedding from it.</li>
            <li> and I am now getting ready to cut six inches from the ends</li>
            <li> too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t gotten a chance to wear it a whole day yet, so</li>
            <li> It looks like the one in the photo and lays very well.</li>
            <li> Very comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say much because of Amazon&#x27;s review policy, but I was infuriated..</li>
            <li> looks real</li>
            <li> Feels like real hair.</li>
            <li> I really like the color too.</li>
            <li> The wig isn&#x27;t too shiny and fits really well.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> It looks like real hair</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s a real head-turner.</li>
            <li> This one looks real and lies close to my head.</li>
            <li> As the tips go on the box, the wig doesn&#x27;t need too much washing, and the any gel water or Vaseline should not be done to wig.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> As the tips go on the box, the wig doesn&#x27;t need too much washing, and the any gel water or Vaseline should not be done to wig.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s very quality for the price.</li>
            <li> Absolutely fantastic wig, especially for the price</li>
            <li> it just like real hair</li>
            <li> haha.</li>
            <li> The care instructions are also very helpful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I put this on and my friends thought  it was real.</li>
            <li> so it arrived lighting fast, which is an added star to this review.</li>
            <li> Very prompt.</li>
            <li> bangs and absoutely  stye keep your $10 add $70 and get a real wig.</li>
            <li> It is soft,comfy,and looks real.</li>
            <li> haha.</li>
            <li> I also had to clip off some really frizzed ends of the hair.</li>
            <li> Thats how much I like the style.</li>
            <li> makes me look like a real long-haired lady.</li>
            <li> I never bought a wig online because I really worry about the quality and the color and something like this.</li>
            <li> It does really look and feel like real hair.</li>
            <li> Very shiny .</li>
            <li> haha.</li>

            <li> The wig feels so real</li>
            <li> Like this wig so much it doesn&#x27;t feel wiggy like some synthetic wigs.</li>
            <li> It looks and feel like real hair.</li>
            <li> I took it straight out the bag and put it on.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Looks and feels real.</li>
            <li> I wore it for 10 hours straight</li>
            <li> so will get another very soon. .</li>
            <li> curlys fast</li>
            <li> the clips in the back are supposed to make the wig fit snug on your head</li>
            <li> It looks like real hair, my boyfriend and his sisters both agreed.</li>
            <li> Way too much hair</li>
            <li> but this is my first wig, maybe that&#x27;s normal?</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s her daily wear piece, she said it&#x27;s comfortable</li>
            <li> this picture is very flattering, and perhaps i would benefit from learning to style wigs..</li>
            <li> Looks real, but I had ti trim the bangs a bit.</li>
            <li> and I have to say it really is all everyone is saying.</li>
            <li> While I doubt you&#x27;d fool anyone into thinking it is your real hair, it is a very high-quality costume wig.</li>
            <li> everyone thought it was my real hair.</li>
            <li> The curls were also very untamed.</li>
            <li> Who ever wants to buy this, do it.</li>
            <li> Way better then expected.</li>
            <li> Looks so real,</li>
            <li> It could pass for real.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Wig came in fast, ordered April 12th, came on April 15th.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> wigs looks real, I like the color</li>
            <li> I recommend this to people who wants this wig.</li>
            <li> However, it was it much better condition than I expected.</li>
            <li> Absolutely haited it.</li>
            <li> it is WAY darker in real life than in this picture.</li>
            <li> in real life it is WAY darker..</li>
            <li> I was very hesitant on even trying to put my strightener to it because of the price I paid for this wig.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve worn both real and synthetic and paid close to $1000 dollars for a wig.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was hesitant to purchase a wig online because I&#x27;m really picky and what a wig looks like on a stand isn&#x27;t always what it looks like on your head.</li>
            <li> Because this wig is so reasonably priced (and I can return it to Amazon if I don&#x27;t like it)</li>
            <li> It is so much like real hair .</li>
            <li> but it looks real a lot of people were asking me if I got extensions.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Looks and feels so real.</li>
            <li> This looks so real</li>
            <li> , our looks so real.</li>
            <li> The wig comb that comes with it, is very flimsy and does not work with the wig.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I would suggest to put the wig on someone else&#x27;s head and light brush the wig starting at the ends.</li>
            <li> All my friends say it looks real.</li>
            <li> so I didn&#x27;t  really expect much from this synthetic hair...</li>
            <li> Plus shipping was surprisingly fast considering it came from across the globe.</li>
            <li> The wig is much better than I expected for the price.</li>
            <li> Very noticeable in front.  </li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> the wig looks and feel real</li>
            <li> it looks real</li>
            <li> I just cut it to a reasonable length.</li>
            <li> Plus the wefts are very visible if if you try to pull up sides or bangs.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t as much as wear it again after a month of buying it.</li>
            <li> The bangs were funky and didn&#x27;t look real.</li>
            <li> I own several pairs of hair extensions both human and synthetic.  </li>
            <li> I am currently hanging the wig to see if the curls will relax and hang more naturally.</li>
            <li> After a few wears I had used it for all it was worth -- then I cut it to a more manageable length</li>
            <li> The hair is beautiful, the only problem I had was it was too small for my head...</li>
            <li> I am a first time wig buyer and was scared to buy a new item I have no experience with.</li>
            <li> I had to trim it up a bit to make it look right but other than these few flaws, its a good wig to wear on a date/job interview/to school and is worth its price.</li>
            <li> pay.it was way to long and tangled way to easy and wig</li>
            <li> After reading different reviews I settled on this wig due to price and having good reviews.  </li>
            <li> Very soft, looks real!</li>
            <li> but otherwise it is more than I expected!</li>
            <li> Too volumnious and long and looks very unnatural, but would probably work for more dressy occasions but not everyday type wear.</li>
            <li> For the price this wig is better than the one I spent $200 on!</li>
            <li> part is a little funny, but nothing a cute head band or some distraction/styling can&#x27;t fix..</li>
            <li> Looks real, no fake shiny look, but the clips broke the second i snapped them together.</li>
            <li> Other than that I was pleased.</li>
            <li> Other than that I love it</li>
            <li> This was actually really cool, good quality, the only complaint is that is was way longer than I thought and</li>
            <li> I was really surprised with this wig, i wasnt expecting much, but i really love it, i had to cut it because it was very very long</li>
            <li> The hair is soft and pretty and depending on the lighting looks totally real.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have a realistic part, its very voluminous which adds a cartoony look to it, and its shiny.</li>
            <li> but the fiber irritates me because it needs serious maintenance for it to look good</li>
            <li> only drawback is that, like with any long hairpiece, it gets tangled quickly and easily.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too long and too big to wear everyday &amp; tangles easily but will be a good costume addition.</li>
            <li> and it looked so beautiful just like in the picture and not like fake looking as i was expecting it to be.</li>
            <li> I got the curly dark brown and totally satisfied.</li>
            <li> Looks so natural on me and it looks exactly like the picture.</li>
            <li> Its more of an auburn vs. dark brown.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I&#x27;m more of a dark blonde.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not a bad low price wig to try if you just looking for cosplay.</li>
            <li> Though it does tangle pretty easy but less now that I trimmed it.</li>
            <li> as described took a little while in the mail but nicer quality for a cheaper wig if you&#x27;re looking to start off with different with this is a good one</li>
            <li> However, I washed it and put four plastic hair curlers in it for a day and it is just like new!</li>
            <li> You can style it with loose clips, wear a hat or headband with it just fine.</li>
            <li> Hopefully the black one will be better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought better wigs for half the price.</li>
            <li> Definitely went above my expectations for a wig. :)</li>
            <li> Still fairly decent quality.</li>
            <li> My hair is short and blonde, and I love changing things up.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s better that I expected the hair is so soft</li>
            <li> This is a decent product for the price.</li>
            <li> Decent quality for the price.</li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t look realistic.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s because the wig is super volumous and make your head big!</li>
            <li> On top of that, apparently this item is not eligible for returns (something that was not clear to me at the time of purchase).  </li>
            <li> One caveat: If you wear wigs daily, be warned: it dries it up quickly.</li>
            <li> But they only last for two months at most.</li>
            <li> I have very short hair because I love having short hair.</li>
            <li> With mine, it did not have the fake shine to it that most wigs have, and it has been able to keep</li>
            <li> Decent for the price.</li>
            <li> am no longer ashamed, and afraid that people can tell that my hair is not my own, and I even feel sexy.</li>
            <li> If it&#x27;s cut it to realistic length and the bangs are shaped up.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a decent wig.</li>
            <li> it got here quick enough</li>
            <li> When I wore it, everyone said I looked hot ^_^ it does tangle a little, but for me, it was easy to untangle.</li>
            <li> Pretty wig, shipped fast with prime, really long and pretty, gets lots of compliments.</li>
            <li> I was really excited about getting a wig with long hair.</li>
            <li> The only thing I am not used to is the bangs, but they are very pretty.  </li>
            <li> It took a bit of brushing to get the curls right, and it shed a bit initially, but I think any wig would, and it doesn&#x27;t shed so much anymore.</li>
            <li> Granted the part is a little bit of a give away if you&#x27;re up super close, but nonetheless very realistic :) The bangs were on the opposite side of mine naturally</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this brand</li>
            <li> Discription said high quality.</li>
            <li> High quality, plus extras ...wig cap and wig comb.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> would highly recommend this wig.</li>
            <li> You would never know the difference in price between a high end wig?</li>
            <li> This is a fairly high quality costume wig.  </li>
            <li> This wig looks so much more professional than some of the other wigs I have.</li>
            <li> I bought this originally for a cosplay but it is SO natural looking that I might end up wearing it occasionally!</li>
            <li> Wow!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments on this wig and people have been stunned by how little I paid for it.</li>
            <li> I would recommend it to anyone who loves the cute little girly look.</li>
            <li> I bought this wig with one that cost a little more</li>
            <li> so natural!!</li>
            <li> Looks even greater if you add a little tease for volume.</li>
            <li> i love the little face</li>
            <li> There was some light shedding and tangles (nothing a comb can&#x27;t fix), but my only MAJOR critique is about the bangs.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kind of hard for me to review this product.</li>
            <li> not too shiny not too dull nice color.</li>
            <li> Its a beautiful color, the only reason she gave it a 4 is it was a little long and had to trim it, but</li>
            <li> Just be very very careful with it because it tangles easily</li>
            <li> I do mean curls, the picture shows more gentle waves but large ringlets</li>
            <li> I was surprised at how real this wig looks.</li>
            <li> It looked real and it was soft.</li>
            <li> The shipping and everything was great, but this wig looked too fake on.  </li>
            <li> so this wig makes me look normal</li>
            <li> JUST A FEW IS OK</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as full as it looks and it has some pieces that are way too long.</li>
            <li> all buzzed except for the top which is only about 5 inches long)</li>
            <li> I love this wig I wear it everyday</li>
            <li> I bought this wig b/c I thought it would be fun to wear occasionally.  </li>
            <li> Overall it&#x27;s a fun piece for the price.</li>
            <li> It states on the box that you shouldn&#x27;t use the comb for the wig as it isn&#x27;t a professional wig comb :/ nice gesture though.</li>
            <li> Although it could not be worn as one&#x27;s natural hair, it was longer and more natural than I expected.</li>
            <li> so it doesn&#x27;t look like a fake one, you can feel how soft and smooth it is when you touch it, just like my own</li>
            <li> For the ridiculously low price, it is extremely lifelike.</li>
            <li> amd wore it a few more times.</li>
            <li> It is a good wig for being silly at home, but I would not feel comfortable wearing it out in public.</li>
            <li> but that is not a complaint for me.</li>
            <li> The natural part of the hair is on a skin-colored piece rather than the mesh-looking lace, so even that looks pretty natural.</li>
            <li> so I just cut it to look like my normal hair.</li>
            <li> I like that it is nice and thick.</li>
            <li> The length is a little too much and the ends get tangled easily.</li>
            <li> Not even close to plastic looking, not much of a shine, large curls, avg fit nicely, waist length, and thick!  </li>
            <li> it is by far better quality than the synthetic wig i bought at the wig shop and the synthetic-human blend i bought at the wig shop and was $60 less.</li>
            <li> Only qualm, hair falls out easily when brushed</li>
            <li> My hair is dyed blonde right now and my hair doesn&#x27;t show through.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s long and curly, and looks super</li>
            <li> I t was super long when it came</li>
            <li> it is super long....</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s also really long too, very pretty.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t going to buy it at first because the low price made me skeptical but seeing all the great reviews and photos convinced me to get it</li>
            <li> The little cap can help collect her own hair and make it easier to wear the wig since she has a short hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s become my new go-to hair whenever I get done up.</li>
            <li> Through a bandanna or hat on or a bow and bam new look.</li>
            <li> so I could compare as I&#x27;m new to wigs.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to wigs and I can&#x27;t figure out the parting</li>
            <li> I posted a picture on fb where a friend thought I was showing off the headband I was wearing not realizing I was talking about my new wig.. Just not liking the bang area yet.</li>
            <li> being said, my wig doesn&#x27;t look like the one pictured (the one that is pictured now is a new version).</li>
            <li> ; Wont even give me a refund or resend me a new wig.</li>
            <li> Brand new.</li>
            <li> and I had to cut a few inches off because of the tangling and also cut the bangs for a more natural look</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s extremely soft, flexible and realistic looking!I waltzed into my living room to show my brother</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t worry about done because it&#x27;s definitely not aproblem, if it is for you just simply powder it or use dry shampoo, just as effective for me.</li>
            <li> I was very surprised when I got</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very soft...</li>
            <li> Looks very natural.</li>
            <li> They both look very natural.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very soft and not too shiny</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice and long and has a natural shine as opposed to that weird look many synthetic wigs have.</li>
            <li> That being said, I also love long hair, and I&#x27;ve had my pixie-cut for a very long time.</li>
            <li> It is so soft and super long.</li>
            <li> The manufacturing of this product far exceeded my expectations!</li>
            <li> the only downside is that its parted funny</li>
            <li> Cheers to playing dress up as an adult!</li>
            <li> I used this wig for my first ever cross dress.</li>
            <li> I love it, I&#x27;ve never had hair past my armpit.</li>
            <li> next (: first wig I&#x27;ve ever owned ♡</li>
            <li> For a \\&quot;dark brown,\\&quot; it looks toooo light to me...especially in the light/sun.</li>
            <li> I guess it&#x27;s worth a shot, but I cut mine because it was so long</li>
            <li> The brown is too light for me as I have really dark brown skin.</li>
            <li> But I finally got one since it was so hot.</li>
            <li> All I can say is wow!</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised by this wig!</li>
            <li> If my friends didn&#x27;t already know that I have a bleach blonde pixie cut they would think it was real!</li>
            <li> Purchased to wear as part of a Halloween costume and people actually thought it was my real hair!</li>
            <li> I ordered dark brown and it came is light golden/caramel drown.</li>
            <li> This wig looks so natural!</li>
            <li> The wig is pretty but you will need to wash and comb it regularly to avoid rats and tangles.</li>
            <li> Only get this if you plan to wear it exactly as it looks</li>
            <li> so it looks like I have professionally dyed hair!</li>
            <li> I was worried about buying this, I buzzed off my long gorgeous blonde hair in a pregnancy break down moment</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments on it, and plan on ordering the long straight black one</li>
            <li> and I really think it&#x27;s a wig with high quality, because I found no stitches or lines in the root that obviously showed from the wig design.</li>
            <li> Other than that I would totally recommend this for first time users then try some extensions and full lace/front lace.</li>
            <li> it gets messy kinda easily</li>
            <li> Since this is my first purchase with MelodySusie, I may follow up in the near future for an update.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the exact same Colorado as my natural hair colour.  </li>
            <li> I had to wear my naturally long hair down with it to make it look more realistic.</li>
            <li> This wig looks and feels natural, and it&#x27;s so soft!</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone who just wants long hair for fun, or for every day use for people like me with medical problems.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soft, flexible, the style is good but the bangs are a little mixed up with the long hair</li>
            <li> Very light weight but thick hair feel...</li>
            <li> Mine got so snarly and tangled at the ends and so dry after just one time of wearing it that I had to trim it right away.  </li>
            <li> anyway~ there is a comb and a cap in it, which may be the free gifts from the seller (and you&#x27;ll see that these little tools are so</li>
            <li> It was a little to light</li>
            <li> and I cut it a little to fit the frame if my face</li>
            <li> Wig also has an elastic closure at nape of neck against scalp that you can slip the little hook to customize tightness of fit if desired.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend, but I am a bit hard on my wigs and it lost most of its curl in the longer pieces.</li>
            <li> So I bought this wig cause my hair is super short and some days I get super lazy.</li>
            <li> Very high quality, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> If you want a natural, real looking wig, I&#x27;d definitely recommend this one.</li>
            <li> I was surprised at the quality of the wig.</li>
            <li> IT&#x27;S NOT SO NATURAL LOOKING WIG</li>
            <li> Delivery was also prompt.did not have to wait 4-5 weeks like some product wigs that are shipped directly from China.</li>
            <li> but that is some thing that can easily be fixed.</li>
            <li> The bangs are pretty long</li>
            <li> Wow.</li>
            <li> it was so soft and lasted longer than both wigs i bought at the shop.</li>
            <li> Color is natural.</li>
            <li> It made me completely self conscious.</li>
            <li> Will take some adjusting to make it look natural.</li>
            <li> looks natural</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s so soft</li>
            <li> WOW...</li>
            <li> so I wasn&#x27;t surprised.</li>
            <li> I just cut off 18 inches of my hair and really don&#x27;t like my short hair.</li>
            <li> I bought this wig for a Halloween costume, and was pleasantly surprised in the quality of the wig for the price.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Now my only real beef is with the color.</li>
            <li> Looks so real that my husband stopped mid sentence.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s natural and it could be quite well to wear it every</li>
            <li> It could be much longer than it looks like in the picture, I&#x27;m 5&#x27;5\\&quot; and it even goes to the bottom of my back.</li>
            <li> This is a great wig for occasional use, this wig needs a lot of care and the quality gets poor later on</li>
            <li> Received product midday a day early.</li>
            <li> Looks really natural.</li>
            <li> It was really soft too.</li>
            <li> He couldn&#x27;t even tell he said it completely changed how I looked!&lt;br</li>
            <li> After a few wears it does start to get a bit frizzy but some light combing does the trick.</li>
            <li> far exceeded my expectations for the price.</li>
            <li> Ive never worn one before, and I have ALOT of natural hair that has to be held beneath it.</li>
            <li> Most people seemed to think I dyed my hair, no one seemed to notice it grew at least a foot.</li>
            <li> I know this is really a problem for all of the wigs, especially the curly one and if not properly taken care of, it&#x27;ll tangle fast.  </li>
            <li> About cleaning and maintenance, I suggest that cleaning could be done about every 15-30 days, which is helpful to keep your wig glossy and soft, but not too often.</li>
            <li> And you know sunlight is kinda harmful to wigs, it need to be away from direct sunlight if you are not wearing it.</li>
            <li> And if you are a girl in the market of long curly wig, I really recommend this one for you!  </li>
            <li> The hair is soft...</li>
            <li> It is NOT as pictured and needs some finesse with the wig comb to make things look natural there.</li>
            <li> I may buy another one for when this one gets old.</li>
            <li> The only drawback is the front of it isn&#x27;t really what is pictured.</li>
            <li> Wow what a bargan for the money.</li>
            <li> and it looks really natural.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised when I received this wig.  </li>
            <li> Overall I really like it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not for me but for a young girl..  </li>
            <li> It looks and feels so natural.</li>
            <li> I just received this yesterday, a day early.</li>
            <li> Hair extensions &amp; dye ruined my natural hair.</li>
            <li> This product is lightweight, not itchy, looks natural, and is adjustable to fit!&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li> ONLY concern is that it will wear out fast.</li>
            <li> It looks natural.</li>
            <li> So I completely re-styled and cut it</li>
            <li> It actually feels like real hair to me.</li>
            <li> I have had no issues with tangles so far.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> If it wasn&#x27;t so big it does look real.</li>
            <li> (One day I will go gray or be old</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s looks and feels natural.</li>
            <li> Soft, silky, lengthy hair.</li>
            <li> Looks and feels like natural hair.  </li>
            <li> but I was really surprised.</li>
            <li> feeling not heavy</li>
            <li> The hair is soft and does not tangle or get frizzy.</li>
            <li> If you wanna make it everyday wear, then I properly recommend a hat or some hair accessories to make it more realstic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> after letting it sit a few days to fall into shape, i was able to finally see the wig as it was meant to be.</li>
            <li> There are a few issues with it, but overall I really love it.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s thick at the top.</li>
            <li> The hair isn&#x27;t a shiny or fake looking so this would make a good every day wig.</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally long and blonde and I wanted to have some fun with something new.</li>
            <li> It had instructions for styling and washing, and it came with a black wig cap and a special wig comb.</li>
            <li> It seems to get knotted a bit easy, but with long curls it is to be expected.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a tiny bit darker than pictured, but that&#x27;s most likely due to lighting.</li>
            <li> It looks quite like human hair and feels soft as lots of review said, not like other cheap wigs I bought before,</li>
            <li> I have yet to wear it for a long period of time but was very surprised when my item arrived how real it looks.  </li>
            <li> Only downside is the shine which can easily be powedered down</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem to tangle easily, though it does come with a small comb.</li>
            <li> A bit shiny, not super full.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a cute wig; but is a little too long.</li>
            <li> The bangs are a little long but nothing a Bobby pin can&#x27;t fix. :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d actually wear a wig that cost less than $20 in public, but when I put it on, I was stunned to see how convincing it looks!&lt;br</li>
            <li> The wig looks very realistic, it&#x27;s a bit long, but I&#x27;m having it trimmed.</li>
            <li> Usually, the wigs from the stores run me $40-$100, sometimes more depending if I want one made of human hair.</li>
            <li> Its so realistic looking there are even low lights and color to it.</li>
            <li> I have no previous wigs, hairpieces, extensions etc.</li>
            <li> but after cutting into a bob, it&#x27;s pretty nice.</li>
            <li> to my review: If you&#x27;re looking for an affordable and realistic looking wig I definitely recommend this one!</li>
            <li> A little full at the crown</li>
            <li> I agree with other purchasers that it does tangle easily but with gentle combing (it comes with a little, metal comb)</li>
            <li> i am a teen and in high school.</li>
            <li> While the actual hair feels real enough, the fit is akward and makes my head look and feel way bigger than it actually is.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend for those ladies who simply want to wear for a one night out with their friends...</li>
            <li> bangs can mess up quickly, so you have to adjust them..</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my personal preference, but I loved the length in the front (halfway down my chest) but the back was almost down to my butt.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit long, but it looks so real, that doesn&#x27;t even matter.</li>
            <li> The hair isn&#x27;t quite as long or curly, and the bangs are much longer.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this wig to anyone who wants long wavy hair.  </li>
            <li> I recently cut my hair short and miss long hair so much some days, I&#x27;ve worn this more than a few times out</li>
            <li> first off the wig was jammed into the box and when i took it out, i had to untangle it.  </li>
            <li> I wear this to work every day because I can&#x27;t walk around here with my pink hair (it&#x27;s too &amp;#34;extreme&amp;#34;).</li>
            <li> but I wanted a dark wig for fun.</li>
            <li> I thought it might be a little on the thinner side as you would see at regular party stores, and another reason was because of the cheap price.</li>
            <li> but it does knot easily and hard to brush or comb through...</li>
            <li> Even with little movement and a good combing through it would be tangled moments late.</li>
            <li> Dark brown doesn&#x27;t look right on me</li>
            <li> My biggest complaint is that it tangles so easily</li>
            <li> Still have the long hair, but just thinning on top, not a cute look.  </li>
            <li> I actually bought two of them, one curly, one straight, and I&#x27;m thinking about buying a 3rd one to cut shorter!</li>
            <li> I finally came back and read the reviews on it, and I figured for $18, it wasn&#x27;t too much of a risk to check it out.</li>
            <li> i LOOKED EXACTLY how my hair did when i was younger long and curly.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The pieces that are missing aren&#x27;t super noticable</li>
            <li> I love the wig it looks real c: although i hide the part with a beanie because it looks weird</li>
            <li> I liked the color (a dark cherry brown) and the texture (not cheap feeling!).</li>
            <li> However, I HAVE to wear it now because i have no other one...</li>
            <li> The color does NOT look fake, and I love it!</li>
            <li> It itches a little bit, but still is much better than other wigs I have tried</li>
            <li> I am a first time wig buyer and was surprised to see that it came three days earlier than expected</li>
            <li> It is very long (longer then normal natural hair)</li>
            <li> It was fun to do something a little different, and the wig looks realistic enough.  </li>
            <li> The curls are lovely, and it is very thick.</li>
            <li> I mean I look gay wearing it.</li>
            <li> feels realistic, and its very long.</li>
            <li> I even posted a pic on here on how it looks on me in general.</li>
            <li> I have a lot to say so bare with me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Came much faster than I expected.</li>
            <li> This wig has made me feel like I can be in public again without being self conscious.  </li>
            <li> felt very well made for the price and was money well spent.</li>
            <li> Having recently shaved my head for cancer support, I decided to go brunette (I am a natural redhead).</li>
            <li> first thing was how heavy the package was, but it&#x27;s not heavy on my head.</li>
            <li> The bangs are the most frustrating thing to work with.</li>
            <li> I initially didn&#x27;t like the wig because of this and because of how tightly curled it was, however, after trimming up the bottom layer and brushing it out, I ended up liking it very, very much!</li>
            <li> Please be aware that it is much longer than it looks like in the picture, in hits past my bellybutton!</li>
            <li> The whole wig is very long in the back</li>
            <li> my only complaint with it is that it tangles easily and the curls tend to fall out when you comb it.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s was fake, once you start brushing it gets ruined, &amp; it tangled way too fast an easily.</li>
            <li> I mean, it was a cheap wig</li>
            <li> Product is much to long and is far more curly then picture, and the lack of combs makes it very hard to keep on.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for a Halloween costume with pretty low expectations due to the price.  </li>
            <li> It is just as thick as pictured, and the curls are very pretty and natural looking.</li>
            <li> but no matter how loose it keeps sliding off the back exposing the real hair line.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this for post-chemo baldness and likely I will wear it on special occasions only, or braid it and wear it with a hat for everyday use.</li>
            <li> This wig laid flat and the bangs molded to her face naturally.  </li>
            <li> I was NOT disappointed in the least.</li>
            <li> I did have to cut the bangs shorter, and after wearing it long a few times I cut the back a bit shorter to fit my style.</li>
            <li> The shipping was fast for it being on the other side of the world and all, so no complaints on the wait here.</li>
            <li> I spent over an hour on amazon looking for a decent wig to go on a night out with my man</li>
            <li> but I thought it was a bit too long &amp; not very thick.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Quite possibly the only true complaint I have with this wig is that near the front of the hairline, you can see that it&#x27;s a wig.</li>
            <li> like it better with a beanie on to cover the hairline because I&#x27;m a little self-conscious but it might be different after a few cleanings too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I really like the color of the wig, which is really a dark brown, but I think it&#x27;s not that shiny as the pic</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s long and natural looking.  </li>
            <li> I love the color and everyone thinks it is my natural hair because it is so close in cold and texture to my natural hair.</li>
            <li> it is what I excepted long and soft...</li>
            <li> Not sure if I would buy again but absolutely worth the try.</li>
            <li> I have a full head of thick curly hair</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soft, super thick, heat resistant, super long, and looks SO real, little to no plastic shine.</li>
            <li> The wig comes just a little bit curlier than the picture, but the color and style otherwise is the exact same.</li>
            <li> I had to cut a lot of the hair to look normal, the front is hard to style and figure out how to hide the lining, and it gets very tangled.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very long and soft.</li>
            <li> Very long, the look is natural, the feel is sub-par</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very long and looks natural.</li>
            <li> but I used some dry spay shampoo to dull it down and it looks much more natural now.</li>
            <li> I recommend this product to anyone just experimenting with wigs, it will last you a long time too if you follow the care instructions, but its nothing professional.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thin and tangles easily, though.</li>
            <li> Not happy with this - has a strong chemical smell and NO clips/combs affix this to any hair on your head.</li>
            <li> Its true, it does get a little bit tangled, but use common sense and be gentle with it.</li>
            <li> in real life it looks almost black and with a hint of red in it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad the reviewer didn&#x27;t have any negative effects but typically heat melts synthetic hair.</li>
            <li> but it was unopened so no major complaints the part is a little funny</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very glamorous; long, long curly locks and very long bangs.</li>
            <li> The wig doesn&#x27;t have a funny smell to it at all, and it even comes with a little wig comb and a wig cap!</li>
            <li> and I just cut it for a little, and it looks like much cuter.</li>
            <li> I read a lot of bad reviews beforehand, and now that I&#x27;ve received this wig, I realize many of the negative reviews are from people who bought cheap knockoffs from unauthorized sellers!</li>
            <li> I have several large strands that are just long and black (frizzled)</li>
            <li> is kinda a natural black, not too shiny and looks like that black of real hair (but it could be a little bit shiny in the sunlight).It&#x27;s straight</li>
            <li> recommendation is, if you have a small head and want REALLY long hair and keep it from tangling then its right for you.</li>
            <li> My husband tried it on, too, and though the length is rather ridiculous, it really looked like his natural hair.  </li>
            <li> I still like it, but some of the hair in back is just not the same, How long should a wig last?</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m to lazy to style it because it&#x27;s really curly</li>
            <li> Looks natural, I am naturally a dark brown brunette with some medium brown at the ends.  </li>
            <li> It was somewhat small but I still rock it thanks</li>
            <li> I usually wash it in baby shampoo and conditioner in ice water for about three days for all my wigs really and</li>
            <li> Well the roots are crappy,nappy,and look weird but the length is great and its really thin but remember its not real human hair</li>
            <li> only problem I had with this wig is the fact that it was a bit too long for me, so I trimmed it.</li>
            <li> I used to have hair this long and just recently cut it off.</li>
            <li> Can u curl this wig with flat irons?</li>
            <li> Why not???&lt;br /&gt;I did cut about 4 inches off in the back, it was a bit long for me.</li>
            <li> so it didn&#x27;t last too long, although I just put it in a bun to the side</li>
            <li> Every couple days I&#x27;d comb through and flat iron it at 200 degrees</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t know how long lasting it is</li>
            <li> and straggy long in the back but tanged and matted&lt;</li>
            <li> Its really long at the back</li>
            <li> i used a flat iron just to run over it</li>
            <li> The picture does not show how long it is but is hits my lower back</li>
            <li> My only thought on improvement is that it is very long, so you may want to cut some length.</li>
            <li> However, maybe I just consider &amp;#34;dark brown&amp;#34; to be nearly black, which is what my natural hair color is.</li>
            <li> Only wore for a few hours so far &amp; have a detached track in it.</li>
            <li> Also, it doesn&#x27;t look like this picture, it&#x27;s really thick from above the shoulders  but gets really think after that, like long Cindy Brady pigtails.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;After the full month, the hair line started getting a bit unmanageable with frizz and the thick black lining of the cap on the hairline started showing every time i&#x27;d part the hair.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I just got a bad one- because other reviews said they loved theirs.  </li>
            <li> This thing stinks and is not a dark brown its a light brown.  </li>
            <li> However, I have been purchasing wigs for a very long time, and this one seems to dry and get tangled within the 3rd week of wearing this wig every day.  </li>
            <li> Two stars for the quality of the rest of the wig, but major thumbs down for the visible under-cap at the part line.</li>
            <li> The semi-bangs are a little difficult to manage, but overall ok product.</li>
            <li> I have no hair and it still felt so much better with the cap on&lt;br /&gt;Might have to trim&lt;br /&gt;Sheds a little (but I&#x27;m pretty rough, so it could just be me going barbarian on it with my brush)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> When I got this wig, I was skeptical because it was so cheap</li>
            <li> I did have to trim it a bit, because it was really long.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit on the long side</li>
            <li> The bangs aren&#x27;t nearly as long and swishy as in the pic, and with my fivehead I need the bangs...</li>
            <li> Now regretting the decision, this allows me to have long hair again.</li>
            <li> The longest hair version is really long.</li>
            <li> long then I thought</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t want it this long you&#x27;ll have to trim it up.</li>
            <li> I plan on growing my hair out again but that will take a LONG time so this will do until then.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is so, so long.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like freakishly long....</li>
            <li> For this MelodySusie wig, I don&#x27;t want this long</li>
            <li> The bangs are sooo long and when you push them aside, the wig separates and you can see the netting.</li>
            <li> so I can grow long hair.</li>
            <li> My son and husband did not even notice (I also have long hair)</li>
            <li> It was really long.  </li>
            <li> but it was a bit too long</li>
            <li> I wore it out a few times and it looks completely natural.  </li>
            <li> but I guess thats what long hair does?</li>
            <li> It was quite long though.</li>
            <li> To control that I just went ahead snipped it because it was extremely long</li>
            <li> It was a bit long</li>
            <li> Its definitely as long as it is in the picture, though the color is not as brown.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is a really long wig though.</li>
            <li> It is extremely long, I trimmed it a bit.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s long, curly, and multi functional.</li>
            <li> Oh I almost forgot, it is really long.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not soft at all</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really long</li>
            <li> long so if you want to cut it to style it to your taste you have the option to do so</li>
            <li> and i just couldn&#x27;t wait any longer to have long hair.</li>
            <li> This wig was so long it had to be cut.</li>
            <li> It tanges as any long hair does,</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really  long</li>
            <li> so I could have it long too.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, the part in the front leaves a strange separation on the wig where you can kinda see the wig material (I&#x27;ll add a photo).</li>
            <li> I have always wanted long hair</li>
            <li> The bangs are way long.</li>
            <li> Basically I could do  a long braid and that was it.</li>
            <li> ALL the time when i&#x27;m out and feel like wearing a wig(i&#x27;m strange).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quite long and the bangs really are as thick as in the picture.</li>
            <li> It was uneven at first but just cut off a few inches</li>
            <li> The hair really is surprisingly thick once you match the bottom layer to the rest, and after gently brushing it, it looks just like the preview pic.</li>
            <li> worth the money not happy</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t the same color as pics, but I&#x27;m sending back and getting the black.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The only little complaint I&#x27;ve got is about the hairline in the front part, it might be the only detail to find if it&#x27;s a wig or my real hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The only little complaint I&#x27;ve got is about the hairline in the front part, it might be the only detail to find if it&#x27;s a wig or my real hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a big wearer of wigs other than for Halloween</li>
            <li> unlike I had been reading in some of the other reviews prior to purchase.</li>
            <li> I like the curls, the bangs, and how long it is!</li>
            <li> It does shed a little bit but nothing major.</li>
            <li> so I will have to cut it off since it&#x27;s very long.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 5&#x27;2&amp;#34; and this is very long, it reaches my tail bone.</li>
            <li> Very long wig - so</li>
            <li> It is a very long wig (I am 5&#x27;3&#x27;&#x27; and it reached my waist)</li>
            <li> Very long</li>
            <li> It was very long</li>
            <li> This looks natural,beautiful curls,and very long so you can cut if you want shorter.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very long.</li>
            <li> the color is darker than in the picture and the wig is very long (I&#x27;m 5&#x27;2</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s however VERY long (I&#x27;m 5&#x27;1&#x27;&#x27;)</li>
            <li> VERY VERY LONG unnatural length.</li>
            <li> but the ends dry up almost immediately and need trimming.</li>
            <li> so it could dry.</li>
            <li> pat it dry.</li>
            <li> but I recently had to cut my hair really short which kinda killed my self esteem, and to help boost it</li>
            <li> Thin and very gaped (about 3/4 inch) between wefts in the back.</li>
            <li> The wig is very long and looks like real long curly brown hair.</li>
            <li> The waves are loose as stated and it is very long, approx.</li>
            <li> The only reason I didn&#x27;t keep the wig was because the color of the dark brown didn&#x27;t suit me as we&#x27;ll as I thought it would.</li>
            <li> It is dark enough took look like my hair, but has lots of brown tones to it.  </li>
            <li> The color was definitely lighter than dark brown and didn&#x27;t match my hair color</li>
            <li> will have to say if you are not used to wigs, or hair down to your back</li>
            <li> it came down to about an inch above my belly button)</li>
            <li> I received my hair today 5/2013 2 weeks earlier then expected!!  </li>
            <li> Not high quality at all.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s QUITE long and layered, which means that the bottom layer looks extremely wispy and thin at first.</li>
            <li> I m thinking about getting the same wig in black.</li>
            <li> The wig is pretty small and i have a small head</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure I personally would ever wear this in public, but you could probably pull it off.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m around 5&#x27;5&amp;#34; and 5&#x27;6&amp;#34; and it reaches the bottom half of my back.</li>
            <li> When you receive the wig wash it to fluff it up a bit, comb it out and let it dry.</li>
            <li> Its almost a bit too thick, doesn&#x27;t look very natural.</li>
            <li> Looked very natural even over my thick hair.</li>
            <li> decently thick, and very soft.</li>
            <li> The hair is thick and it looks very natural</li>
            <li> The only thing bad about it is it does get tangled and frizzy easily.</li>
            <li> It was fun to go from blond, to brown, and to black hair that always confused the costumers at my work.</li>
            <li> but this one feels like box colored coarse gray hair; it is very stiff and gritty.</li>
            <li> The wig is tight enough that it does not really need them and</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s brown with a little hint of red.</li>
            <li> Came dry and not as expected!</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical because this wig was so cheap.</li>
            <li> I have blonde hair, the hair is a very dark brown.</li>
            <li> I have blonde hair, the wig is very dark and didn&#x27;t show through.</li>
            <li> I gave up and did a big no no and brushed this sucker...</li>
            <li> Minimal shedding.</li>
            <li> I wear it in my every day outings now (when I get tired of my pixie cut, haha).</li>
            <li> It is a lot longer than I expected and sparser than I expected.  </li>
            <li> A bit longer than expected</li>
            <li> Let me start off by saying that I have absolutely NO experience in buying wigs, and this is just for Halloween.</li>
            <li> thats to be expected with the length.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not real hair</li>
            <li> so you do have to be careful not to brush it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had it for a few months</li>
            <li> FP718 Dark Brown Long Curly.</li>
            <li> Looks like a wig not real hair.</li>
            <li> Of course I checked with it carefully after I got this wig.</li>
            <li> but thats to be expected with all synthetic hair.</li>
            <li> Came sooner than expected.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also allot thinner than I expected.</li>
            <li> so the color aged me quite a bit</li>
            <li> I am going to be using the wig for drag</li>
            <li> or as I expected it to be</li>
            <li> It does shed a bit if you&#x27;re rough with it</li>
            <li> but the length is a bit longer than I expected.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve already had a few pieces of the hair fall out, but I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s a big deal.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The color that arrived does not match what is shown in the picture for Cark Brown, it is a lighter brown than what was expected.</li>
            <li> Also, I actually wear this almost everyday because everyone likes how it looks on me.</li>
            <li> Because the bangs were so heavy, I ended up cutting them shorter and it makes it look stunning.</li>
            <li> It was wicked long and looked fake after the first wear.</li>
            <li> This wig is sumptuously soft and gorgeously thick.</li>
            <li> The shine of the hair is quite natural and the hair is fairly thick.</li>
            <li> It made due for the reason it was purchased but It is defientley not high quality or made for continuous wear.</li>
            <li> However, over the long time I&#x27;ve been a customer, the quality has gone down.</li>
            <li> VERY long (down to my butt).</li>
            <li> I thought I could tightly braid my long hair against my head and wear this wig comfortabley...</li>
            <li> My moms only complaint was it&#x27;s too long</li>
            <li> I have short hair and always want a thick long hair.</li>
            <li> It does get a little tangly at the back of the neck like previous comments stated, but</li>
            <li> It is a little long for my taste, so I just trimmed the bottom up a bit</li>
            <li> Except the bangs are a little long.</li>
            <li> the wig was pretty limp and lacked some serious volume!</li>
            <li> I had some trouble figuring it out, but I&#x27;ve never had long hair before, and after about 30 minutes of working with it</li>
            <li> I was really skeptical about buying it at first</li>
            <li> Nothing a wide tooth comb can&#x27;t fix!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 5&#x27;8&amp;#34; and the longest tendrils fall to the small of my back.</li>
            <li> By the way, the hair is full, and there is room for cutting as the ends (some of them) reach my tail.</li>
            <li> But it IS extremely CUTE!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not sure the picture is the same wig even.</li>
            <li> 28-30 inches, which is 2-4 inches longer than my other wigs.  </li>
            <li> I will buy another MelodySusie wig due to the quality of this one.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait for my other orders to come in.</li>
            <li> I may need to trim the wig and bangs as they are a bit long for everyday use.</li>
            <li> and it isn&#x27;t scratchy like some other inexpensive synthetic wigs.</li>
            <li> Id rather go buy some other wig.</li>
            <li> Check out \\&quot;other customers</li>
            <li> other</li>
            <li> I got this wig with two other wigs off Amazon.</li>
            <li> The hair doesn&#x27;t have that superficial wig shine like a lot of other synthetics.</li>
            <li> There were a few minor tangles but that was from packaging.</li>
            <li> the other.</li>
            <li> I do have a small head, so you can&#x27;t have a big head for this.</li>
            <li> (looks like you have split ends)&lt;br /&gt;becomes tangled but not like other wigs where it is unbearable</li>
            <li> Spray a little dry shampoo on it then put it on and style it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m someone who loves to dye her hair ridiculous colors, and my work recently got a new boss who says no more colors!</li>
            <li> The instructions on the box are a little ambiguous and are written in poor English, which seems a little bit unprofessional to me; granted it&#x27;s a foreign company, but you&#x27;d think they&#x27;d hire someone that is proficient in English to write the instructions for their packaging if they are planning to sell to American consumers.</li>
            <li> Its a little different than the photo, but after straightening a few spots I made it work.</li>
            <li> The dark brown is not really that dark.  </li>
            <li> this is too small seems like it would be for a child instead of an adult, too small do not buy</li>
            <li> They do not stay together well anymore, you can see the netting no matter what, they shed like crazy, and the straps in the back stretch fast.</li>
            <li> Only thing is its a bit thin in the back.</li>
            <li> texture is a little thinner than I expected.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little darker than I wanted, but i should have expected that.</li>
            <li> I had to trim it a little because it was a little uneven in the back</li>
            <li> texture, unlike other synethic wigs that can often feel wiry.&lt;br /&gt;wig cap is black and isn&#x27;t visible around the wig&lt;br /&gt;Extra</li>
            <li> not too shiny the cap is a little small for my big head</li>
            <li> Bangs are wierd, does not stay on head correctly and hard to fasten in the back.</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying, as someone that suffers from Trichotillomania and has to wear a wig daily, high quality is of the utmost importance to me.</li>
            <li> Its down to my butt gets a little tangled  but not much.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that you CAN see the inside of the wig in some places.</li>
            <li> I like the dark drown color.</li>
            <li> This wig is the quality of a real wig(real hair, expensive wig).</li>
            <li> I posted a pic, this is fresh out the box without any cutting or treatments.</li>
            <li> Fits very well and doesn&#x27;t look fake.</li>
            <li> The color was not as dark as I thought it would be; however it compliments my complexion in a copper brown color.  </li>
            <li> ( I got dark brown</li>
            <li> The only negative was in the crown area</li>
            <li> but my sis order on that was to dark</li>
            <li> i dont recommend this wig unless you are going to a costume party or have dark eyebrows.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is there is no part in the wig.</li>
            <li> when you brush it (violently) it holds up okay</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s thick enough to hide the cap</li>
            <li> not what i expected.has a very fake look to it but not bad for cost.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 5&#x27;8 1/2 and the wig went down to my belly button</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s the other one I don&#x27;t like!</li>
            <li> One thing that I was disappointed with was that the hair falls out, not a lot though and the curls tangle easily.</li>
            <li> And about the bangs, like some reviews mention that it could be hard to style, and my advice is trim it if it get in the way of your sight of you just want a short bangs, or you just need a little hairpin or a hat to fix it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> Since I&#x27;m a short girl, it looked a bit ridiculous.</li>
            <li> I bought the black curly wig.</li>
            <li> It was brown instead of black.</li>
            <li> Only thing is the side line for the part has nappy hair making it look fake but overall</li>
            <li> The only thing that makes it alittle obvious that it&#x27;s fake is the length</li>
            <li> I ordered one black and on brown</li>
            <li> It arrived in less than two days.</li>
            <li> but I also couldn&#x27;t spend an hour and a half a day straighting it just to wash it again in a week.</li>
            <li> this one just I dont even have to pick it half the time..</li>
            <li> I learned, after spending thousands of dollars, that my previous statement is not the case.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;ll go for black</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I was very surprised!</li>
            <li> However, when I received it it was a mess of tangles and shedded everywhere while I combed it.</li>
            <li> The first time I wore it was a bit awkward, but I sworn it a lot now</li>
            <li> Not as expected and was not sure is I could return it.</li>
            <li> To your but long, and not that thick</li>
            <li> We did have the bangs trimmed by a hairstylist to frame the face because it&#x27;s a little odd looking out of the package.</li>
            <li> so I trimmed it down a few inches.</li>
            <li> The wig stays on tight, I just put a ponytail in my&lt;br /&gt;hair</li>
            <li> put it on your head and hold the hair in your hand, squeezing tight and then begin brushing the ends and work your way up to the nape of the neck.</li>
            <li> /&gt;First I just want to say that there&#x27;s a buckle inside the wigs inner cover if you find it hard to wear a wig or afraid of loosing, it can help fasten the wig to your head and make it steady.</li>

            <li> I like a less dramatic side part, so simply sectioned some over to the other side</li>
            <li> My wife has very thin hair due to heredity and she has been so self conscious about it.</li>
            <li> so I will be trimming the ends and adding a few slight layers before wearing it again</li>
            <li> the cap on  Might have to trim  Sheds a little (but I&#x27;m pretty rough, so it could just be me going barbarian on it with my brush)    </li>
            <li> but I took the bangs and moved them to the one side and teases a little.</li>
            <li> But that lasts for a little bit.</li>
            <li> the little hooks it has under the wig break</li>
            <li> 23&amp;#34; in circumference and 16&amp;#34; at the temples- the other wig was too small in the temple area.</li>
            <li> If you want a wig for little money that feels so life like this is it.  </li>
            <li> comes with a little comb</li>
            <li> the cap is a little too snug though.</li>
            <li> may need to cut a  little off, but otherwise-Nice</li>
            <li> so I was a little sceptical.</li>
            <li> but it can be a little fluffy</li>
            <li> down to my torso!</li>
            <li> The hair is silky; the color is very dark with a reddish tint.</li>
            <li> A little thin in the back</li>
            <li> FOR EVERYDAY USE.  </li>
            <li> I was very skeptical at first</li>
            <li> Totally addicted and I will definitely be buying</li>
            <li> I have really thin hair (and I&#x27;m in my 20&#x27;s, I suffer from Alopecia), and I usually go to a local wig store where I can try one on.</li>
            <li> After a few weeks this started looking like a greasy weave.</li>
            <li> I will be ordering another one because this is an everyday wig for me for school.</li>
            <li> Soft, not so shiny that it looks fake.</li>
            <li> Waste.</li>
            <li> Dont waste your time.&lt;br /&gt;thin</li>
            <li> I do not wear it everyday, but I have worn it often.</li>
            <li> I give this a 3-star rating for a few reasons:&lt;br /&gt;1</li>
            <li> Poor quality I received over a month open box look at it and push it in a corner to donate</li>
            <li> I also like that it&#x27;s not too heavy and for the price</li>
            <li> but it felt a bit on the heavy side..</li>
            <li> The cap itself is also high-quality and keeps your hair firmly against your head.</li>
            <li> It even came with a wig comb and saved me the trouble of getting a cap.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s poorly made doesn&#x27;t stay on properly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not cheap (like from a costume shoppe) at all.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> what  a waste of money and time...</li>
            <li> The picture isn&#x27;t the same what you get.&lt;br /&gt;Was not happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;Looked like a Halloween wig&lt;br /&gt;Came</li>
            <li> It does shed a bit and a little hard to manage due to its legnth.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s all the way down past my belly button</li>
            <li> At first I was so scared and doubtful about this product, since I am a strong believer in reviews and they ranged from bad to great.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t believe this wig was less than $20!</li>
            <li> I cut it to make it shorter and easier to tame.</li>
            <li> She was so surprised when she got this little gift since she is so crazy about wigs.</li>
            <li> Little do they know its a wig!</li>
            <li> My friends were so jealous of this wig and could not believe me when I told them how little I had paid for it!</li>
            <li> It requires very little upkeep and does not tangle.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m shocked how real this wig looks.</li>
            <li> and I was shocked about how real it looked an felt</li>
            <li> and I was not satisfied at all.</li>
            <li> so i ended up cutting some of the hair off to make it short and straighten it in a medium heat level slowly and carefully.</li>
            <li> The only weird part are the bangs</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re not sure just buy it.</li>
            <li> MI hair is really thin due to health issues. .but</li>
            <li> I am half black and was cursed with dry hair that was impossible to manage</li>
            <li> The bangs are really long and difficult to manage, so I&#x27;m going to trim them to keep them out of my eyes, you may also pin them in place with a bobby pin.</li>
            <li> and I found one ill be using for a long time!</li>
            <li> The only down side is it got kinda tangled after wearing times, but it&#x27;s not as bad though.</li>
            <li> I was super skeptical because of the bad reviews</li>
            <li> was hard</li>
            <li> I learned that the hard way.</li>
            <li> and it was hard to tuck under when I noticed it and wasn&#x27;t in my bathroom to fix.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s hard to comb out once it gets tangly.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a little thin at the ends</li>
            <li> A little thin and</li>
            <li> I expected it to have that shiny fake hair look</li>
            <li> After reading some of the negative reviews, I was put on guard, but ordered anyway, because I figured it had a return policy.</li>
            <li> ) wigs are (at least for me</li>
            <li> and he could not tell, he was shocked when I told him a few days later.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I combed it out (the comb sucks)</li>
            <li> so I just kept cutting the ends short</li>
            <li> As a hair stylist I was afraid of the quality with the price being so low</li>
            <li> (I thought it was going to be late)</li>
            <li> The texture was too thick and shiny.</li>
            <li> I believe I&#x27;ve washed it two times since I&#x27;v had it and the hair has gotten alittle thick towards the roots of wig and the bangs.</li>
            <li> I mean A LOT)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 5&#x27;0&amp;#34;, and it went past my rear!</li>
            <li> The color is pretty bad, and looks fake.</li>
            <li> I bought this wig for a cosplay I was doing, but unfortunately, it&#x27;s too dark for the character I&#x27;m cosplaying as.</li>
            <li> when i put it on, it looked REALLY fake because of how dark it was.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to tell which side they go on, and to get them to stay properly - any wrong styling and the bangs begin to look very poor and get in the way.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s ridiculous</li>
            <li> I bought before wigs that were 3-4 times more expensive with horrible quality.</li>
            <li> not super shiny like the fake ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The hair lining is ridiculous though.</li>
            <li> but seriously, the smell just makes you wonder how it was made.</li>
            <li> Also, the bangs are too long, so I tried to trim them but it makes your forehead look weird!</li>
            <li> /&gt;There is no problem with the quanlity of the hair, just the front part are a little fake, but I fix it with some hair accessories, it works greats.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Black</li>
            <li> My secret is to use baby or body powder to dull the shine</li>
            <li> I really regret buying this horrible wig not satisfied at all</li>
            <li> I was looking into extensions and wigs because I am trying to grow out my hair, but I always end up getting bored of my hairstyle and end up cutting it short.</li>
            <li> It is very hard to part.  </li>
            <li> It was very hard to style.</li>
            <li> I wore it one time, and was told due to parting and bangs on it, it looked very fake.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thick and heavy, like a bad shag faux fur coat from the 1975 film Dolemite.</li>
            <li> and once it&#x27;s been brushed a few times it gets snarly and terrible.</li>
            <li> It is on the thin side but for $17 bucks,  </li>
            <li> the tangles will get worse.</li>
            <li> Poor quality.</li>
            <li> I am thin and 5&#x27;7&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> and if it were real hair on someones head they would have the worst fried split ends I have ever seen.</li>
            <li> you can see the under part and it looks like broken hair or fuzz.</li>
            <li> Poorly made wig.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s alright, merely a day late.</li>
            <li> For the price I was expecting the wig to be of poor costume-y type quality...</li>
            <li> Was not happy with this wig at all.</li>
            <li> Also, it was a little matted at the part which makes it look a bit fake!</li>
            <li> I regret every single minute geez.....total crap</li>
            <li> It does tangle a little but not to bad.</li>
            <li> A little shinier than I prefer, but not too bad.</li>
            <li> yet I would not be the least bit afraid of it coming off.  </li>
            <li> Looked really fake and was thin.</li>
            <li> Just minutes after taking this off my hair started itching like crazy, progressively worse and worse...</li>
            <li> I am a little disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was kinda skeptical about buying a wig online.</li>
            <li> I was so wrong</li>
            <li> Not plastic-ky or fake.</li>
            <li> But at the price I figured I couldn&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> Not itchy or uncomfortable at all.</li>
            <li> You cannot part it without it looking absolutely fake.  </li>
            <li> I have never worn the wig because of how fake it looks.</li>
            <li> then it is a bit difficult to style and take care of.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t  look fake or plasticy</li>
            <li> Looks fake feels fake.</li>
            <li> So sorry my pix came out</li>
            <li> So I bought this to change my look whenever I get bored of my hair.</li>
            <li> every thing about this wig looks fake.</li>
            <li> The texture of the hair is all wrong.</li>
            <li> It looked fake, but as I got used to it and styled it around</li>
            <li> Not wonderful but not</li>
            <li> Not impressed</li>
            <li> Nothing wrong with the wigs.</li>
            <li> So when I got this one and put it on looked so fake.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t look so fake if you put hat on over it.</li>
            <li> Sorry</li>
            <li> but it looks fake</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s difficult to part the hair because you&#x27;ll see the netting of the wig..</li>
            <li> The curls on this do seem to get exaggerated a bit with wear.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not happy...!!!!</li>
            <li> also it just looked fake</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first,as soon as it came</li>
            <li> unable to even attempt a comb out...</li>
            <li> but you can tell that it&#x27;s fake.</li>
            <li> so I was nervous about the quality and if it&#x27;d look too fake</li>
            <li> Very poor quality, can&#x27;t even wear for Halloween.</li>
            <li> Even after cutting it, it still bounced in to a curl.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m planning on cutting it to alleviate some of the knots and tangles.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s so awkward and messed up.</li>
            <li> : the wig gives your head an awkward shape.&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I ended up cutting it to my collar bone.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> And the crazy part is.</li>
            <li> I just finished cutting it chin length.</li>
            <li> This wig turned out to be a disappointing purchases.</li>
            <li> This hair tangles like crazy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so mad</li>
            <li> People say they can&#x27;t even tell its fake!</li>
            <li> Wrong!</li>
            <li> I was very afraid it would be fake shiny</li>
            <li> It is very fake looking..</li>
            <li> it was impossible.</li>
            <li> : it&#x27;s almost virtually impossible to keep it untangled.&lt;br</li>
            <li> But it kept getting tangle and the ends started to go bad</li>
            <li> Just bad choosing on my part.</li>
            <li> I should post pics of how bad the bang job is.</li>
            <li> For the price I was shocked at the quality of this wig.</li>
            <li> but it would make it shed worse and make it look nasty</li>
            <li> The wig was poorly made and has an awful color.</li>
            <li> I am so disappointed in this item.</li>
            <li> I was extremely disappointed.  </li>
            <li> but it didn&#x27;t work :(</li>
            <li> :c</li>
            <li> Bummed:(</li>
            <li> It is annoying trying to maintain it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s crap.</li>
            <li> And the cap in the package can help to bundle your hair.&lt;br /&gt;Maintenance is an annoying part for me</li>
            <li> And the cap in the package can help to bundle your hair.&lt;br /&gt;Maintenance is an annoying part for me</li>
            <li> Highly disappointed and disgusted.</li>
            <li> and she hated it.</li>
            <li> This was the worst wig I have ever bought.</li>
            <li> Terrible buy</li>
            <li> It is horrible.</li>
            <li> I tried washing it but all that did was make it smell horrible.</li>
            <li> they are so awful</li>
            <li> The WORST part is the hair lining</li>
            <li> Bangs are horrible.</li>
            <li> Came on time horrible product</li>
            <li> Horrible product!</li>
            <li> This is absolutely horrible.</li>
            <li> I give it 4 stars instead of five because it tangles horribly</li>
            <li> Very unhappy!!!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s terrible</li>
            <li> and it tangles terribly</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> LOVE IT!!! I am going to have so much fun with this!!</li>
            <li> Great wig for the $$... Gets tangled very easily.</li>
            <li> I was surprised at the quality of the wig. It&#x27;s great! A little full at the crown but otherwise it is more than I expected!</li>
            <li> I had the same one previously and I loved it, this time the one that came was frizzy at the top of the lining right when I pilurchashed it. I haven&#x27;t had time to even look more closely to see if I can fix it but this is my second one. The first one my boyfriend purchased for me and it was great.</li>
            <li> excellent wig, looks real. curls were perfect but be careful taking it out because It does tangle easily, and the comb they provide doesn&#x27;t help. I have blonde hair, the hair is a very dark brown. I wound up straightening it and it actually looks much better. I have blonde hair, the wig is very dark and didn&#x27;t show through. good quality, doesn&#x27;t shed, but the waves will get knotty easily so be careful... it&#x27;s also really long too, very pretty.</li>
            <li> This wig was great, people thought it was my real hair.  It stayed on all night and was comfortable.  It didn&#x27;t get tangled and I can wear it next year.</li>
            <li> Pros: cute, cheap and affordable&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Constant shedding and tangling.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it! I got it in the mail today and decided to wear it as an &amp;#34;every day&amp;#34; wig. Couldn&#x27;t be more happy with the product, cap, comb, and way it fit. Because the bangs were so heavy, I ended up cutting them shorter and it makes it look stunning. Great product for the price and so natural looking! Also a big plus are the curls, I&#x27;m in love!</li>
            <li> Way more uh, &amp;#34;Beyonce&amp;#34; then I was anticipating.  Too volumnious and long and looks very unnatural, but would probably work for more dressy occasions but not everyday type wear.</li>
            <li> I am a first time wig buyer and was surprised to see that it came three days earlier than expected and it looked so beautiful just like in the picture and not like fake looking as i was expecting it to be. It also fits my head very good, it doesn&#x27;t itch like you&#x27;d think it would and the curls are perfect. I did however have to cut the bangs because i have a little forehead lol and the wig kind of tangles a bit but so does my real hair so what &#x27;ev that&#x27;s why there&#x27;s wide toothed combs &lt;3 I would recommend this wig for anyone like me who just needed a wig for my job, i normally have pink hair so this wig makes me look normal lol</li>
            <li> Received it today and I love it! Though it does tangle pretty easy but less now that I trimmed it. Great wig for the price!</li>
            <li> The wig is absolutely gorgeous! It&#x27;s a tiny bit darker than pictured, but that&#x27;s most likely due to lighting. I bought this wig for a cosplay I was doing, but unfortunately, it&#x27;s too dark for the character I&#x27;m cosplaying as. It is however, a very good quality wig, especially for the price. It&#x27;s nice and long and has a natural shine as opposed to that weird look many synthetic wigs have. If they had this wig in a lighter color, I&#x27;d definitely buy that one.</li>
            <li> Wow!! I am so impressed! Haven&#x27;t even brushed it yet and it looks so natural! :)</li>
            <li> Feels real great delivery time</li>
            <li> This looked so much better in person that I could have imagined!  It actually looks like real human hair.  Very high quality for a great price.</li>
            <li> I ACTUALLY CAN SEE...  AFTER ALL IT&#x27;S NOT SO NATURAL LOOKING WIG, DEFINITELY NO FOR EVERYDAY USE.  JUST FOR FUN / HALLOWEEN, IT&#x27;S A GOOD WIG.  MY ADVICE IS THAT IF YOU SEE MANY REVIEWS WITH PHOTO (JUST A FEW IS OK BUT IF &amp;#34;MANY&amp;#34;) THOSE ARE MOST PROBABLY PAID REVIEWS, SO BETTER NOT TO TRUST.</li>
            <li> I have alopecia, so I wear wigs on a daily basis. This was an impulse order to have a longer wig, but it is now my daily use wig! It looks so real,,and is very full. It feels just like real human hair! Sometimes I have to comb the bangs just so, so the cap doesn&#x27;t show underneath, but it&#x27;s been easy to fix. I love it!</li>
            <li> this wig is wonderful it&#x27;s very long and soft. it feels so natural I have to cut it a bit but for the most part it is wonderful.  if you have a bighead like me it would be perfect. It tangles a bit but beside that it wonderdful!</li>
            <li> Pretty wig Bought for my sister and she really likes it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a cute wig; but is a little too long. I am 5&#x27;7&amp;#34; and the longest piece of hair comes to my butt.</li>
            <li> This wig is really good! It DOES get tangled very easily though. It&#x27;s my first wig, and everyone I&#x27;ve talked to thinks I got my hair colored / extensions. My only complaint is that you CAN see the inside of the wig in some places. Minimal shedding. I love it :)</li>
            <li> as described took a little while in the mail but nicer quality for a cheaper wig if you&#x27;re looking to start off with different with this is a good one</li>
            <li> So pretty! It is on the thin side but for $17 bucks,  you can&#x27;t beat it. Love it.  Will buy again.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a lark thinking it would be &amp;#34;costumey&amp;#34;. It is not.  It looks so real, I cannot believe it. It also comes with a special comb and skull cap to keep your own hair hidden underneath.  I am totally impressed with the quality of the hair. It looks like human hair.</li>
            <li> Pieces of the wig appeared to be cut off but the color is nice.&lt;br /&gt;The pieces that are missing aren&#x27;t super noticable but they take a hit to the over all quality of the product itself and my expectations.</li>
            <li> It was very valumized stays on pretty well.  it gets messy kinda easily but it&#x27;s totally worth the money!</li>
            <li> Bought this wig for a costume party. It&#x27;s not as full as it looks and it has some pieces that are way too long. I had to wear my naturally long hair down with it to make it look more realistic.</li>
            <li> This is a very good wig for the money. I luv it. My hubby luvs it too when we cosplay but I have worn it out as well.&lt;br /&gt;I think it is well made. Delivery was also prompt.did not have to wait 4-5 weeks like some product wigs that are shipped directly from China.</li>
            <li> Its really good quality for what i paid. Only downside is the shine which can easily be powedered down</li>
            <li> Sooooo perfect. I was very skeptical at first but I love it!!! It looks so amazingly real it&#x27;s ridiculous</li>
            <li> The manufacturing of this product far exceeded my expectations!</li>
            <li> I was surprised at how real this wig looks. My husband tried it on, too, and though the length is rather ridiculous, it really looked like his natural hair.  Amazing, especially considering the price.</li>
            <li> I used this for a Belle costume, and it was perfect! I did have to trim it a bit, because it was really long. But it was really beautiful. Even after cutting it, it still bounced in to a curl. I sprayed it with dry shampoo to get rid of the shine, and it was perfect. I wear it in my every day outings now (when I get tired of my pixie cut, haha). It&#x27;s a great quality wig for the price.</li>
            <li> So I have a teal Mohawk which isn&#x27;t a great hairstyle for a professional career, so I decide to try out wigs to see if it was a worthy investment to get a real hair wig. What I didn&#x27;t expect was for me to be completely happy with the wig that I got as a trial wig. It&#x27;s the perfect hair color and style. It&#x27;s easy to take care if though it tangles easily. It&#x27;s a bit on the long side but that is some thing that can easily be fixed. Over all an excellent buy!</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure about it when it arrived. It took a bit of brushing to get it looking good and it shed a lot more than I would have liked, but now I LOVE it. Totally addicted and I will definitely be buying more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like it better with a beanie on to cover the hairline because I&#x27;m a little self-conscious but it might be different after a few cleanings too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also gave it a MASSIVE haircut in the back. It&#x27;s my personal preference, but I loved the length in the front (halfway down my chest) but the back was almost down to my butt. Since I&#x27;m a short girl, it looked a bit ridiculous. But once I trimmed it, it looks much more realistic and is easier to manage.</li>
            <li> I was kinda skeptical about buying a wig online. I have really thin hair (and I&#x27;m in my 20&#x27;s, I suffer from Alopecia), and I usually go to a local wig store where I can try one on. Usually, the wigs from the stores run me $40-$100, sometimes more depending if I want one made of human hair. The wigs from the wig store shed so fast and tangle really easily. This wig looks and feels natural, and it&#x27;s so soft! I love this wig! The wig doesn&#x27;t have a funny smell to it at all, and it even comes with a little wig comb and a wig cap! It arrived tangle-free and silky. I&#x27;ve been wearing it for one day and already I&#x27;m getting so many compliments on it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only problem I had with this wig is the fact that it was a bit too long for me, so I trimmed it. Also, I restyled it, because I like the &amp;#34;side-swept&amp;#34; bangs look. It&#x27;s so easy to style too! So I definitely recommend this wig for anybody who is looking to buy a wig! It would make a great cosplaying wig too! Seriously, it&#x27;s a great deal so go for it! Definitely went above my expectations for a wig. :)</li>
            <li> This wig is by far the BEST for the price hands down. It does tangle easily though. I cut the bangs because I didn&#x27;t like how side bangs made me look, I get so many compliments. Good amount of hair and looks very realistic!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments on this wig and people have been stunned by how little I paid for it. It&#x27;s become my new go-to hair whenever I get done up.</li>
            <li> This was the worst wig I have ever bought. It was very trashy and looks like it was already worn a lot. I would never buy from these people again. thank God Amazon refunded me because I could not be caught in or outside of my home in that wig.</li>
            <li> It is not like the picture</li>
            <li> Love this wig! I use it on my mannequin at my lingerie store. Its so realistic looking there are even low lights and color to it.</li>
            <li> I got the curly dark brown and totally satisfied. I have short hair and always want a thick long hair. It makes me confident and feel very feminine.I am 5 feet 2 so I will have to cut it off since it&#x27;s very long. I m thinking about getting the same wig in black. p.S: the second pic is the short wig. So they are all wigs ;-)</li>
            <li> The wig doesn&#x27;t come in as matte as it looks in the picture. Still fairly decent quality. You could probably just throw something on it to make it more matte if you really wanted to wear it out. It&#x27;s fine for costumes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m absolutely in love with this wig! I wasn&#x27;t going to buy it at first because the low price made me skeptical but seeing all the great reviews and photos convinced me to get it and I&#x27;m so happy! I have very short hair (an undercut, all buzzed except for the top which is only about 5 inches long) so this wig is great for those days I want to feel super girly. I honestly feel like a princess when I wear it, when I wear it I don&#x27;t want to take it off. I&#x27;m 5&#x27;2&amp;#34; and this is very long, it reaches my tail bone. Its true, it does get a little bit tangled, but use common sense and be gentle with it. Don&#x27;t rip and pull at the knots or else the tangles will get worse. I might trim it to help it not be so tangled and to make it more practical for going out. The bangs are pretty long but if you know how to cut hair you can trim them. Also, the hair looks so real. I expected it to have that shiny fake hair look but when I took it out of the box and put it on it didn&#x27;t look obnoxiously shiny at all, it just looked like real healthy hair. I definitely recommend it! Make sure you&#x27;re buying it from the right seller. You don&#x27;t want to get duped.</li>
            <li> Wow. For the price this wig is amazingly worth it. High quality and very beautiful and deep color. I love how it looks!</li>
            <li> I brushed it and the curl still has lots of bounce. The clip is nice and right and the bangs are the perfect length.</li>
            <li> way better than i expected it to be. beautiful color and length. exactly as pictured. the curls are beautiful as well. would defiantly buy again</li>
            <li> The color I purchased was not the color I ordered! It came multiple shades lighter than I put and I was not satisfied at all. I sold the wig to someone that liked the color. WIl not be purchasing from this company again</li>
            <li> Not bad for the price. Tangles very easily.</li>
            <li> I bought the black curly wig. BEST PURCHASE I EVER MADE FOR A WIG! It&#x27;s soft, super thick, heat resistant, super long, and looks SO real, little to no plastic shine. I&#x27;ve worn mine for months to school and everyone thinks it&#x27;s my REAL HAIR!!! LOVE THIS WIG! I&#x27;ve learned to never buy from anyone else.</li>
            <li> It sheds a lot. Poor quality. I do not recommend at all. The curls fell the first day i had it.</li>
            <li> The wig is very long and looks like real long curly brown hair. I recommend it!</li>
            <li> I love this wig I wear it everyday no one ever knows that it is a wig they won&#x27;t believe me unless I take it off! Great for everyday natural look although it gets tangled easily and I had to cut a few inches off because of the tangling and also cut the bangs for a more natural look</li>
            <li> Omg LOVE it! Looks so natural on me and it looks exactly like the picture. I look so pretty now lol</li>
            <li> It was so long, and tangles very easy. I cut it to fit, and used coconut oil in it, and it&#x27;s perfect now!!</li>
            <li> The best wig ever  I love it</li>
            <li> It looks nothing like the picture. It was brown instead of black. The texture was too thick and shiny. Not a repeat.</li>
            <li> Really good wig for the price! I&#x27;m happy with it. I&#x27;m no wig expert, but I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s a step up in quality from Halloween costume wigs.</li>
            <li> After a few weeks this started looking like a greasy weave. And washing it with wig shampoo made it really tangled.</li>
            <li> I like this wig but then i don&#x27;t like it, because you have to find the time to take care of it and i rather pay more for human hair then to wear this again!</li>
            <li> I was very worried to buy a wig online, but I needed a quick and cheap one for a sudden convention. its very confortable and not at all shiny. I would highly recommend this brand and I know I will be buying from them in the future!</li>
            <li> this was the first wig i bought on amazon after buying two at a wig shop in a city by me. it is by far better quality than the synthetic wig i bought at the wig shop and the synthetic-human blend i bought at the wig shop and was $60 less. it was so soft and lasted longer than both wigs i bought at the shop. I was so please with this wig that ive bought it twice! i intend to buy it again soon.</li>
            <li> I adore it. Sure it tangles a little easy but every woman has a purse keep the comb in there the only thing that was off was that the comb packaging looked like it been through he&#x27;ll and back but it was unopened so no major complaints the part is a little funny but I took the bangs and moved them to the one side and teases a little. Through a bandanna or hat on or a bow and bam new look. It&#x27;s also really easy to style. I will be ordering another one because this is an everyday wig for me for school. I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking to change up there look. I have a full head of hair but I&#x27;m to lazy to style it because it&#x27;s really curly this wig is perfect.  Love it.</li>
            <li> The wig was okay at first but after having it on once it became tangled and unmanageable. Plus if you tried to brush it the brush would bend or break. Terrible buy I&#x27;m glad I got my money back.</li>
            <li> The bangs aren&#x27;t nearly as long and swishy as in the pic, and with my fivehead I need the bangs... but the color is nice and the texture soft and silky. Just be very very careful with it because it tangles easily and once it&#x27;s been brushed a few times it gets snarly and terrible.</li>
            <li> Good price for a change in looks. I have no previous wigs, hairpieces, extensions etc. Nice wig has been easy to work with and restyling has been easy. I put it on and talked to my neighbors for over 30 minutes and they never noticed. I used to have hair this long and just recently cut it off. Now regretting the decision, this allows me to have long hair again.</li>
            <li> This wig fits like a dream! And it&#x27;s beautiful, looks real. Also, good price for the quality.</li>
            <li> LET ME TELL YOU ABOUT THIS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I absolutely freaking loved this wig. It&#x27;s long and curly, and looks super cute!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also came with a wig comb and a wig cap. Totally unexpected, but I&#x27;m not complaining; I loved it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, considering the price, it&#x27;s worth it. Definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheap,... but it is great quality!!!! love love love! Long beautiful length with curls and it even has tonal dimension that you see in real hair! Im a hairstylist and i wanted to play with wigs on my mother (and myself heheh) we love!</li>
            <li> Pretty wig, shipped fast with prime, really long and pretty, gets lots of compliments. Can&#x27;t beat the price! Color is really nice too.</li>
            <li> Good wig. I was wearinv it. Quality is good. Price is very good. Quality is as good or even better than much more expensive wigs that I bought online. I bought before wigs that were 3-4 times more expensive with horrible quality. Color is natural. Good thing to buy. Would buy it again.</li>
            <li> In a moment of insanity I bought this for our daughter. It is horrible. It stays tangled and unmanageable and I just don&#x27;t like it at all. Right now it looks like the cat had kittens in it. I would never purchase such an item again unless I am out of my mind.</li>
            <li> it was nice the first day i got it but quickly fell apart and got all ratted. I will never get another one. It was wicked long and looked fake after the first wear. It made me completely self conscious. It knotted thefirst time i wore it and i couldn&#x27;t get the knots out. I tried washing it but all that did was make it smell horrible.</li>
            <li> This wig looks amazing! I love the way the bangs as they are easily combed down to cover an eye or you can whisk them straight across the brow. I will be buying this wig again, guaranteed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Love this wig! It looks so real and it was easy to manage and put on. Fits perfectly well and there is even a strap to adjust the wig to fit your head better. The curls looked great and the color was perfect. Would definitely recommend this product and would buy it again.</li>
            <li> just got this in the mail and it pretty and wavy it looks like real hair! the only downside is that its parted funny</li>
            <li> Just like the picture and it is soooooo comfortably comfy!!!! Not itchy at all out of all the wigs I own thi s one is my fav</li>
            <li> For the price I was shocked at the quality of this wig.</li>
            <li> First and foremost. Not for big heads, or people with lots of hair already. I thought I could tightly braid my long hair against my head and wear this wig comfortabley...you cant. However, I feel like shorter hair would be able to fit. Otherwise, beautiful hair. Soft, not so shiny that it looks fake. Will take some adjusting to make it look natural. Pretty sweet deal for being that cheap, though.</li>
            <li> I bought this wig b/c I thought it would be fun to wear occasionally.  I just got it in the mail today and the quality is AWESOME!  I&#x27;m so ordering another one.  If you&#x27;re looking for good quality, and real looking... get this wig!!!</li>
            <li> not a bad purchase, descent quality. not what i expected.has a very fake look to it but not bad for cost.</li>
            <li> Can u curl this wig with flat irons?</li>
            <li> I love role-playing with this wig! It&#x27;s very glamorous; long, long curly locks and very long bangs. I had to trim them a bit, but who cares after I rip it off and it ends up on the floor anyway. Cheers to playing dress up as an adult!</li>
            <li> I just chopped all my hair off and decided to give a wig a try. I own several pairs of hair extensions both human and synthetic.  I have never tried a wig though. My hair is dyed blonde right now and my hair doesn&#x27;t show through.  This wig is cheap so I thought it would suck. I was so wrong, it&#x27;s amazing, super soft and really beautiful!  I ordered it and ups delivered it to my door three days later!! Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Love this wig! Great quality for a great price!</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t the same color as pics, but I&#x27;m sending back and getting the black. Seems like an easy return. Will post updates. Also, it was a little matted at the part which makes it look a bit fake! Hopefully the black one will be better.</li>
            <li> This is a great quality wig, I have had a ridiculous amount of compliments. Today I wore it to the grocery store and the cashier was like &amp;#34;Oh my god, your hair is so adorable. Who cuts it?&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I couldn&#x27;t help but laugh and blurt out the fact that it was a wig.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes with a wig cap and a cute brush, I will be buying from these sellers again!</li>
            <li> Not happy with this - has a strong chemical smell and NO clips/combs affix this to any hair on your head. Ridic!</li>
            <li> It was actually pretty damn amazing.. For the price I got it at comes with a cute comb and hairnet looks natural I love it.! Only thing is the side line for the part has nappy hair making it look fake but overall deff awesome</li>
            <li> I love this wig it is prob the best fitting wig n it&#x27;s so soft just luv it</li>
            <li> Great product, fast shipping. Definitely recommended.</li>
            <li> ffer from lupus and been thinking about wigs for a while. The wig is very pretty and good quality. There are a few drawbacks: it is VERY shiny, tangles, and too big for my head. I feel like it is going to fall off.  I will continue to play with it to see what I can work out.</li>
            <li> I used this wig for my first ever cross dress. I had some trouble figuring it out, but I&#x27;ve never had long hair before, and after about 30 minutes of working with it, I got it how I liked it. It is very beautiful, and I had a lot of fun with it. Easily worth the $20.</li>
            <li> Great wig!  No one ever questions its authenticity.  I have used it twice when going out and about town.  It does manage to get tangled, and I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s intended for long-term use.</li>
            <li> [...]  This wig looks fantastic! Not plastic-ky or fake. I will be ordering another one! I get a lot of complements on my \\&quot;hair\\&quot; when I go out :) 100% recommend!!!!!!</li>
            <li> The longest hair version is really long. To your but long, and not that thick so it looks better in a braid or low ponytail. I like the dark drown color. The semi-bangs are a little difficult to manage, but overall ok product.</li>
            <li> Got knotty really fast. It is annoying trying to maintain it. I t was super long when it came so I had to cut it but the fiber irritates me because it needs serious maintenance for it to look good</li>
            <li> This is actually one of my go to wigs!  I love it am buying another</li>
            <li> after washing, it smells good just like the shampoo used&lt;br /&gt;little longer than that looks in the picture&lt;br /&gt;How cheap! but soft and good.</li>
            <li> The wig comes just a little bit curlier than the picture, but the color and style otherwise is the exact same. It came in very nice, professional packaging. It had instructions for styling and washing, and it came with a black wig cap and a special wig comb. I would recommend, but I am a bit hard on my wigs and it lost most of its curl in the longer pieces. However, I washed it and put four plastic hair curlers in it for a day and it is just like new! There is even a piece of flesh-tone flexible material at the very top of the wig in the middle, where the part can be seen, that makes it appear like hair is literally growing out of your head.</li>
            <li> This was one of 3 wigs purchased - all worked out great - and were beautiful  through 2 months of dress rehearsals and performances.  Used both long and styled in elaborate 1900&#x27;s up dos.  Used argon oil to keep conditioned.  Recommend using a wig comb and brush for styling.  Did some trimming on ends for freighing.  Very long wig - so no problem - Still looks great.  THE PRICE IS RIGHT!</li>
            <li> I love my wig!!!! I was really skeptical about buying it at first but hey I could always return it if I don&#x27;t like it so I thought why not. I am so happy I did because I love the color, the length, everything!!! The only thing that makes it alittle obvious that it&#x27;s fake is the length.... It&#x27;s all the way down past my belly button but I like it anyway. The color looks nice and it feels real. It came with everything that it said it would and I couldn&#x27;t be happier. Ba da da da da I&#x27;m lovin&#x27; it. LOL</li>
            <li> didnt fit good was hard 2 get looking nice</li>
            <li> I had to trim the bottom of the wig cause it had to much curl to it but it looks like the real thing!</li>
            <li> GReat wig!  I bought this wig along with 2 human hair lace wigs for my mom who has cancer.  This wig laid flat and the bangs molded to her face naturally.  My moms only complaint was it&#x27;s too long and she wish it was human.  Thank you so much!</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to purchase this. But at the price I figured I couldn&#x27;t go wrong. It fits and feels very nice. Not itchy or uncomfortable at all. Even though it&#x27;s synthetic it doesn&#x27;t have that super wig shine like most. My friends and I did take turns trying it on so it tangled a bit. I&#x27;m planning on cutting it to alleviate some of the knots and tangles. Overall it&#x27;s a fun piece for the price. And I&#x27;m happy I tried it.</li>
            <li> This wig looks amazing and and incredibly realistic. This wig looks so much more professional than some of the other wigs I have.</li>
            <li> You definitely get a good deal for the price. With the length of it I could style it to my fitting, however its a lot curlier than depicted. I love it, its a little shiny but wig shampoo takes that away and its wonderful for a first time wig wearer. I recommend this product to anyone just experimenting with wigs, it will last you a long time too if you follow the care instructions, but its nothing professional. Here are a lot of pics (and I mean A LOT) so you can get a good look. You can style it with loose clips, wear a hat or headband with it just fine. I&#x27;ve had this wig for a while now, I wore it over a week straight just to ensure an accurate review. I hope this helps.</li>
            <li> I got this wig in today (at the exact est time of arrival) and I can&#x27;t believe how great it looks! I was very afraid it would be fake shiny but it isn&#x27;t at all! I am so thrilled with this purchase that 3 family members have already purchased it as well :) I couldn&#x27;t be happier :) (I have been wearing extentions and hairpieces for 10 years) and this is just beautiful.</li>
            <li> I am 50 years old (young) and color my gray roots every 2 weeks, a few days before I color I wear the wig to hide my grays. I just love the wig. I have naturally straight hair, so having a bit of curls and length rocks!  The wig stays on tight, I just put a ponytail in my&lt;br /&gt;hair and away I go. My boyfriend loves the look and I feel 20 years younger!  It&#x27;s just fun to change yourself every once in awhile, I wish more people would wear wigs!..Why not???&lt;br /&gt;I did cut about 4 inches off in the back, it was a bit long for me. I am thin and 5&#x27;7&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Very pleased, better than I expected. Great for the price</li>
            <li> Looked like what I ordered and the comb and hairnet came with it:) would order this again</li>
            <li> A fun wig but I couldn&#x27;t get the bangs to cooperate. Felt more like a hat to me but that&#x27;s just me. It&#x27;s now on display on one of my mannequins. Looks great on it.</li>
            <li> WOW... I did not expect a wig this nice for this price... this is beautiful, and soft, and very realistic... the only issues with it are typical of ALL synthetic wigs, and still much better than most ive had experience with.</li>
            <li> The hair on this wig looks MORE realistic than wigs that cost five times as much! Beautiful... VERY, very long. I&#x27;m 5&#x27;0&amp;#34;, and it went past my rear! Had to get it trimmed...</li>
            <li> While the color is true in the picture the style is not.  It is a lot longer than I expected and sparser than I expected.  Also it tangles very easily and sheds a good bit as well.  It is very hard to part.  You cannot part it without it looking absolutely fake.  I am not a fan of this at all.  I have recently purchased another wig in the same price category and it was so much better than this one!</li>
            <li> The package came to my house very quickly. The hair is beautiful. I dont get that much shedding from it. I have got alot of compliments from it. I believe I&#x27;ve washed it two times since I&#x27;v had it and the hair has gotten alittle thick towards the roots of wig and the bangs. I just gave it alittle hair cut and a real good deep conditioner to make the hair look brand new again.</li>
            <li> Right out of the box this had problems. I have had to make repairs to stitching coming undone three times since recieving this and I am now getting ready to cut six inches from the ends they are so awful and if it were real hair on someones head they would have the worst fried split ends I have ever seen. I am so disappointed in this item. I wish I had went with another one.</li>
            <li> Very happy. looks very good. A bit longer than expected but that&#x27;s good. I&#x27;m 6ft and it touches the very top of my pants in back. Can&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s as nice as it is for the price.</li>
            <li> it nice but long then I thought</li>
            <li> Bought this for work as I have pink/blue hair and would like to keep it that way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is really a great wig, the texture of the synthetic hair seems so realistic compared to other cheaper wigs I&#x27;ve gotten.  It&#x27;s soft, flexible, the style is good but the bangs are a little mixed up with the long hair so I just pinned it back and it looked good that way too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t gotten a chance to wear it a whole day yet, so I&#x27;ll update my review when that happens!</li>
            <li> I am loving my new wig. Took off some length and trimmed the bangs and it&#x27;s perfect.  I am a first time wig buyer and was scared to buy a new item I have no experience with. But I&#x27;m glad I chose this one</li>
            <li> I love it, I&#x27;ve never had hair past my armpit. I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments on it, and plan on ordering the long straight black one next (: first wig I&#x27;ve ever owned ♡</li>
            <li> Pretty nice my only complaints are it tangles easily and the curl fell out the first time I wore it.</li>
            <li> Looks very nice but tangles very easily and is hard to get back the curls once they&#x27;re lost. Not for every day wear. Good for a costume or to wear on occasion.</li>
            <li> The wig is very beautiful out of box. But that lasts for a little bit. I wore it one time, and was told due to parting and bangs on it, it looked very fake. It is gorgeous and curly for the first few hours of wear, but I never wore it again after...I mean, it was a cheap wig so I wasn&#x27;t surprised. Its worth the money if you have a big event to go to, but make sure you don&#x27;t wear it till said event.</li>
            <li> I did not like this wig at all.  I&#x27;ve purchased more realistic looking wigs at Halloween express. I was extremely disappointed.  I have never worn the wig because of how fake it looks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve received so many compliments from this wig! I wear it and feel more confident. It does tangle up a bit if you&#x27;re not careful but other than that a very nice wig. It looks like the one in the photo and lays very well.</li>
            <li> At first I was so scared and doubtful about this product, since I am a strong believer in reviews and they ranged from bad to great.&lt;br /&gt;But this product came in just in time and it&#x27;s just wonderful! Everyone keeps saying how good my hair looks, some people still think this is my real hair!&lt;br /&gt;I will have to say if you are not used to wigs, or hair down to your back then it is a bit difficult to style and take care of. But other wise this products looks so real and feels amazing!&lt;br /&gt;Great product for this great a price! Shipped in when it said it was going to as well!&lt;br /&gt;Will buy again!</li>
            <li> This wig is good for the money I would have to say when know it looks nice and feels pretty soft its only my third favorite  wig would buy again :)</li>
            <li> Let me start off by saying that I have absolutely NO experience in buying wigs, and this is just for Halloween. I was overall very impressed with the quality of it considering the price, and I think this is absolutely the BEST you can get for this price. I have a lot to say so bare with me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Packaging:&lt;br /&gt;It came packaged nicely with a complimentary comb and wig cap. It states on the box that you shouldn&#x27;t use the comb for the wig as it isn&#x27;t a professional wig comb :/ nice gesture though. The instructions on the box are a little ambiguous and are written in poor English, which seems a little bit unprofessional to me; granted it&#x27;s a foreign company, but you&#x27;d think they&#x27;d hire someone that is proficient in English to write the instructions for their packaging if they are planning to sell to American consumers. The box is pretty and high quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hair itself:&lt;br /&gt;WOW! Like I said earlier, this is, without a doubt the BEST you can get for this price. Please be aware that it is much longer than it looks like in the picture, in hits past my bellybutton! If you don&#x27;t want it this long you&#x27;ll have to trim it up. It is just as thick as pictured, and the curls are very pretty and natural looking. The top layers are very short, around shoulder length, which gives the hair a lot of texture, which is favorable to many. It isn&#x27;t extremely perfect and shiny like you commonly see with synthetic hair wigs, the color has golden undertones, making it very realistic looking. The bangs are really long and difficult to manage, so I&#x27;m going to trim them to keep them out of my eyes, you may also pin them in place with a bobby pin. Oh and it seems to tangle pretty easily, but when it does, it gives it that, &amp;#34;carefree, undone&amp;#34; look, which is pretty nice :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quite possibly the only true complaint I have with this wig is that near the front of the hairline, you can see that it&#x27;s a wig. I don&#x27;t know how to explain it much better than that, I might cut the bangs into a fringe style to cover it. I guess you can sort of see the fabric that the wig hair is connected too. It isn&#x27;t too noticeable but still drives me nuts! AH! If anyone knows how to accommodate for this problem please let me know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I might post photos later.t cut the bangs into a fringe style to cover it. I guess you can sort of see the fabric that the wig hair is connected too. It isn&#x27;t too noticeable but still drives me nuts! AH! If anyone knows how to accommodate for this problem please let me know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I might post photos later.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a teenager and I went through the stage of wanting my hair to be every color of the rainbow and did not take care of it, so I had to cut my hair very very short. I wanted a wig, a nice wig but I didn&#x27;t want to pay hundreads of dollars for it.. When I got this wig, I was skeptical because it was so cheap but i had hopes from reviews. I got the wig and it does take some getting used to if you&#x27;ve never worn wig, but VERY easy to get used to in my opinion. Very light weight but thick hair feel... It does tangles, but what hair doesn&#x27;t? Nothing a wide tooth comb can&#x27;t fix! I love this wig and it&#x27;s very good quality, barely any strands have fallen out in almost two months! Buy this NOW!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s crap. Discription said high quality. That&#x27;s joke. Didn&#x27;t use it. Take it back if u would. I&#x27;m not gonna ask money back</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this wig. You certainly have to be careful with it; you won&#x27;t really be able to pull it up without the wefts showing. However, when left down, it looks pretty great. I almost always wear it under a hat or something as it doesn&#x27;t look very realistic at the part. At the very top, it has strange baby hairs, and I&#x27;m not about that either. Still, if no one is expecting you to be wearing a wig, they probably won&#x27;t guess.</li>
            <li> This wig was pretty long and fabulous. I would recommend it to anyone who loves the cute little girly look. The only reason I didn&#x27;t keep the wig was because the color of the dark brown didn&#x27;t suit me as we&#x27;ll as I thought it would. However , it&#x27;s still a good wig. Very comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;Also when I sent the wig back I experienced some of the best customer service I&#x27;ve ever gotten. That was very refreshing&lt;br /&gt;Overall just great.</li>
            <li> Great quality for price</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t be purchasing this again. I can&#x27;t say much because of Amazon&#x27;s review policy, but I was infuriated..</li>
            <li> Wig is great!I have had MANY compliments on it, the only downfall is that it snarls easily, but its no big deal! Looks very real! Thank you for the great wig!</li>
            <li> This wig is soooo cute!  The hair feels real and the waves are gorgeous!  It is a little long for my taste, so I just trimmed the bottom up a bit and I love it.  It does get a little tangly at the back of the neck like previous comments stated, but thats to be expected with the length.  Shipping was faster than stated!  Would defiantely order from this company again!</li>
            <li> This wig is sumptuously soft and gorgeously thick. It&#x27;s quite long and the bangs really are as thick as in the picture. Love it!</li>
            <li> Then I&#x27;ll tell you that I bought this hairpiece, and it was ideal! After reading some of the negative reviews, I was put on guard, but ordered anyway, because I figured it had a return policy. When I got it out of the box, all my fears were put to rest. I have no complaints. The hair is entirely realistic, has no chemical smell, and lays perfectly as it does on the display picture. I love it!</li>
            <li> This wig came in about 3 days after I ordered it. I looks amazing and real. I get so many complements on it by girls and mostly guys. I take a lot of pictures in it also. It is an amazing wig and is low price. This wig is the quality of a real wig(real hair, expensive wig). It does tangle a little but not to bad. I would recommend this to anyone and everyone.</li>
            <li> This product was purchased as a costume piece.  Although it could not be worn as one&#x27;s natural hair, it was longer and more natural than I expected.</li>
            <li> This is as synthetic as hair can get! I also did not like the fit on my head and so I returned it. I would not recommend this but then again different strokes for different folks!</li>
            <li> Looked really fake and was thin. It was soft, but it tangled up very quickly.</li>
            <li> This is a higher quality wig than what you&#x27;d find at a Halloween shop.  It came with a wig cap and a special comb.  I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s comparable to the wigs I used to sell at the mall for $80+.  The length is a really nice length, too.  I&#x27;m 5&#x27;8&amp;#34; and the longest tendrils fall to the small of my back.</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;It looks real-ish.&lt;br /&gt;Its pretty.&lt;br /&gt;Its not super shiny like the fake ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;It saids its one size fits all but it does not. You&#x27;d have to have a very small head to get this to fit you perfectly without poofing up from the top part.&lt;br /&gt;Also the little hooks it has under the wig break easily.&lt;br /&gt;The hair net it came with does not stay in place.&lt;br /&gt;The curls tangle A LOT. Like really, it will tangle and if you try fixing it like brushing it with the plastic cheap brush it came with it will just tangle it more and make it freezy.&lt;br /&gt;The bangs can mess up quickly, so you have to adjust them..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other notes: i think you can straighten it. In the end i could not stand the curls being SO tangled it was impossible. so i ended up cutting some of the hair off to make it short and straighten it in a medium heat level slowly and carefully. Only the roots not the top area,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My recommendation is, if you have a small head and want REALLY long hair and keep it from tangling then its right for you. Because it does look pretty and real-ish.</li>
            <li> Way long, and gorgeous. Feels like real hair. Looks like it, too. I cut it to make it shorter and easier to tame. But still very very nice purchase.</li>
            <li> This wig died after two or three wears, I didn&#x27;t even do anything to it and now it&#x27;s all matted up. However, I HAVE to wear it now because i have no other one... and i&#x27;m blad so... yup. The only reason it isnt a 1 star is because it was actually really nice to the touch (at first...) and was packaged well.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing wig! BUY IT! You won&#x27;t regret it! It looks real and feels amazing!! No wirey cheap type of wig.</li>
            <li> I love this wig!!! Amazing wig!!! I just cut off 18 inches of my hair and really don&#x27;t like my short hair. I was kinda scared about buying a cheap wig on here. I thought it might look like a cheap Halloween wig but so doesn&#x27;t!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this wig to wear as part of my Halloween costume.  I have yet to wear it for a long period of time but was very surprised when my item arrived how real it looks.  It was definitely worth the price I paid for it and I think I will wear it more than just for Halloween since it really does look like real hair.  Great purchase.  Thanks again MelodySusie and Amazon!</li>
            <li> Great product! I&#x27;m used to being iffy on buying wigs online since you never know what you&#x27;re getting, but this wig looks and feels like actual hair! Love!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good for a synthetic wig to be used a few times</li>
            <li> I have never purchased a wig, but wanted to try something different. After reading several product reviews and viewing styles, I picked this one. I posted a pic, this is fresh out the box without any cutting or treatments. The color does NOT look fake, and I love it! I&#x27;m glad I made this purchase and highly recommend that you try one out. By the way, the hair is full, and there is room for cutting as the ends (some of them) reach my tail. I have posted a pic.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this wig.  I cut my hair short some months ago and while I love the convince (as a mama to three boys!) I do miss my lovely, long locks.  I plan on growing my hair out again but that will take a LONG time so this will do until then.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The wig came very quickly and I couldn&#x27;t get it out of the package quick enough.  The cap that comes with it isn&#x27;t fabulous but the wig is perfection.  It is so, so long.  The curls are dreamily romantic.  I agree with other purchasers that it does tangle easily but with gentle combing (it comes with a little, metal comb) it&#x27;s not so bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The wig fits snug on my head and while I have not worn it out yet I would not be the least bit afraid of it coming off.  I cannot wait to go out on the town with my husband and my sexy, long hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(I sent my attached picture to my sister and she promptly purchased three wigs: blond, red and brown.  Score one for Amazon!)</li>
            <li> Lovely and natural looking</li>
            <li> I bought this wig for a Halloween costume, and was pleasantly surprised in the quality of the wig for the price. Worked great!</li>
            <li> I bought this hair for my wife. And she looks amazing in it and she loves it. Will buy more for sure.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t fit on my head, therefore I didn&#x27;t get to wear it, is there a way I can return it? Please let me know.</li>
            <li> Looks awesome everyone thinks its my real hair. Only thing is that it tangles up alot and the comb that comes with it isn&#x27;t that good for it, so I use my own brush.</li>
            <li> This thing is loooonnnggggg!!!! This is my first wig, and well, I&#x27;m impressed for sure. Quality is pretty good, and the wig actually looks and feels almost natural on me :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bangs will need to be trimmed a bit, and I&#x27;m debating whether or not to trim the overall length. It&#x27;s like freakishly long....down to my torso! But it IS extremely CUTE!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now my only real beef is with the color. For a \\&quot;dark brown,\\&quot; it looks toooo light to me...especially in the light/sun. So...to exchange or not to exchange...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But soooo pretty!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-----------------------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: WASH FIRST. Just minutes after taking this off my hair started itching like crazy, progressively worse and worse... Bummer...but my own fault for not washing beforehand. WASH FIRST!</li>
            <li> Looks just like the picture but it&#x27;s thick at the top.</li>
            <li> Just got the wig today had to Fix the bangs but it&#x27;s perfect just what I wanted 😍😍😍</li>
            <li> Cute wig. I really like the color too. Its more of an auburn vs. dark brown. I&#x27;m only 5&#x27;1 so this wig was tailbone length so I had to cut it. I liked it although it tangled a great deal so it didn&#x27;t last too long, although I just put it in a bun to the side and it worked. Not sure if I would buy again but absolutely worth the try.</li>
            <li> Ive never had a wig before. I love this though. It doesn&#x27;t  look fake or plasticy</li>
            <li> This wig&#x27;s pretty great. I wore it for about a month straight, with heavy duty styling before I had to toss it. It IS synthetic so it needs refreshing. Every couple days I&#x27;d comb through and flat iron it at 200 degrees fahrenheit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the full month, the hair line started getting a bit unmanageable with frizz and the thick black lining of the cap on the hairline started showing every time i&#x27;d part the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s great for a few weeks and wonderful for the price.</li>
            <li> This is beautiful!  Looks so real that my husband stopped mid sentence. Came in a nicely designed box, hair net and a wig comb</li>
            <li> Very poor quality, can&#x27;t even wear for Halloween. Not enough &amp;#34; hair&amp;#34; and all frizzed out. Way way way longer than the picture depicts. Not sure the picture is the same wig even. I don&#x27;t recommend</li>
            <li> It arrived on time with no problems. The wig isn&#x27;t too shiny and fits really well. The quality is great compared to others on Amazon. It is pretty much the bang for your buck wig. I didn&#x27;t have a problem with it getting tangled or anything but I didn&#x27;t attempt a head bang so I might not be helpful for that part of the review.</li>
            <li> Great quality wig. Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> I love this wig! It&#x27;s the first wig I&#x27;ve ever got and I&#x27;m completely in love with it! It looks like real hair and it&#x27;s a real head-turner. My hair is short and blonde, and I love changing things up. So this wig is perfect!!! ❤️</li>
            <li> I love my wig.. delivered on time</li>
            <li> I bought this and got it right away. It was uneven at first but just cut off a few inches and it was perfect. Best wig I have gotten so far it was thick and everyone throught it was real. I Do recommend this wig to everyone who is looking for one.</li>
            <li> My wife bought this for our anniversary getaway this coming weekend.  It looks awesome!!!  The color is just like the picture!</li>
            <li> I bought this wig just for fun. It fooled my hair dresser when she saw a picture of me wearing it! It&#x27;s not real hair so you do have to be careful not to brush it. But otherwise it&#x27;s pretty and I love it! Worth the great price. Fits very well and doesn&#x27;t look fake.</li>
            <li> Looks fake feels fake. When you part the hair by&lt;br /&gt;The bangs you can see netting. After a couple times i wore it inside around the house testing it&lt;br /&gt;Out it started shedding and getting tangly I tried brushing it with the comb it comes with but it would make it shed worse and make it look nasty</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t give this 5 stars b/c it&#x27;s a bit itchy as I suspect most (if not all) wigs are (at least for me b/c I have sensory processing disorder). I was very surprised when I got it- first thing was how heavy the package was, but it&#x27;s not heavy on my head. I bought another wig that was twice the price to  be a back up in case I didn&#x27;t like this one- it&#x27;s the other one I don&#x27;t like! This one looks real and lies close to my head. I&#x27;m glad I got both so I could compare as I&#x27;m new to wigs. I cut about 5 inches off the bottom of this one. I&#x27;m 5&#x27;7&amp;#34; and it touched my butt and did tangle easily. I cut the bangs as well. I just got it yesterday so I haven&#x27;t worn it out yet, but I definitely will. I must have a rather large head I guess (?) 23&amp;#34; in circumference and 16&amp;#34; at the temples- the other wig was too small in the temple area. I do not need the elastic band adjustment on this wig, but it does fit and covers nicely. So sorry my pix came out sideways- I tried fixing but it didn&#x27;t work :(</li>
            <li> I just got it today, super fast shipping it&#x27;s better that I expected the hair is so soft not too shiny the cap is a little small for my big head but I can manage</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:mo2IFYD1TUCM8UX]]I got this wig as a Halloween gift from my friend and I thought it was just that wig for Halloween. But it did surprise me with the quality and it was much better than any wigs you get at Halloween store!! I&#x27;ll say it&#x27;s the best wig I have and especially for this price! It&#x27;s natural and it could be quite well to wear it every day!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About the Package:&lt;br /&gt;It was well protected in the outer box of Amazon and no damaging or scratching on it. And the little box for the wig was high quality and nice, I love the cute light purple anyway~ there is a comb and a cap in it, which may be the free gifts from the seller (and you&#x27;ll see that these little tools are so helpful!)The instruction on the box are detailed I think, it introduced the product&#x27;s feature, some maintenance tips and even the pictures of how to do it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About the Wig:&lt;br /&gt;I even browsed all of the reviews of this MelodySusie wig and it got lots of praise. It looks quite like human hair and feels soft as lots of review said, not like other cheap wigs I bought before, and I got say it again that it really could be the best one for this price!!!The color is kinda a natural black, not too shiny and looks like that black of real hair (but it could be a little bit shiny in the sunlight).It&#x27;s straight but it can be a little fluffy so it doesn&#x27;t look like a fake one, you can feel how soft and smooth it is when you touch it, just like my own hair~ It could be much longer than it looks like in the picture, I&#x27;m 5&#x27;5\\&quot; and it even goes to the bottom of my back. Anyway I think it was gorgeous and it fits me quite well. But it does get tangled kinda easily, but please believe me, every wig gets tangled and maintenance is important!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About the Trimming:&lt;br /&gt;You know not every wig fits perfectly when it first came, and I like to trim them if need and then they became \\&quot;my hair\\&quot;. For this MelodySusie wig, I don&#x27;t want this long and I just cut it for a little, and it looks like much cuter. And about the bangs, like some reviews mention that it could be hard to style, and my advice is trim it if it get in the way of your sight of you just want a short bangs, or you just need a little hairpin or a hat to fix it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some Tips:&lt;br /&gt;First I just want to say that there&#x27;s a buckle inside the wigs inner cover if you find it hard to wear a wig or afraid of loosing, it can help fasten the wig to your head and make it steady. And the cap in the package can help to bundle your hair.&lt;br /&gt;Maintenance is an annoying part for me but I do know how important to my wig. As the tips go on the box, the wig doesn&#x27;t need too much washing, and the any gel water or Vaseline should not be done to wig.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only little complaint I&#x27;ve got is about the hairline in the front part, it might be the only detail to find if it&#x27;s a wig or my real hair. It isn&#x27;t too obvious so I feel okay about this. I found a video on youtube of this wig and the beautiful girl might help~ I love my MelodySusie wig and I might buy another curly one!! I do recommend buying this beautiful wig especially at this price, girls Halloween is coming!!!like much cuter. And about the bangs, like some reviews mention that it could be hard to style, and my advice is trim it if it get in the way of your sight of you just want a short bangs, or you just need a little hairpin or a hat to fix it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some Tips:&lt;br /&gt;First I just want to say that there&#x27;s a buckle inside the wigs inner cover if you find it hard to wear a wig or afraid of loosing, it can help fasten the wig to your head and make it steady.

I do recommend buying this beautiful wig especially at this price, girls Halloween is coming!!!</li>
            <li> I love the length and curls of this wig but it gets nappy quick ...highly suggest spraying it with synthetic hair conditioning spray to untangle the curls and lessen the frizz</li>
            <li> I really enjoy this wig. I think it&#x27;s very quality for the price. The down side is that it tangles very easily though. I have cut mine to a more suitable and realistic length and now I love it. I always get told it looks very realistic and pretty. I don&#x27;t wear it daily but more take pictures with it on. I would recommend if you are looking for a nice wig to wear every now and again:) or if you are like me and have a short pixie cut that you like to change up every now and again.</li>
            <li> Absolutely fantastic wig, especially for the price</li>
            <li> I was the maid of honor in my best friend&#x27;s wedding this past weekend, and I really wanted an affordable wig that would look realistic enough to help me blend in with the rest of the bridal party (I recently shaved my head to support a friend going through chemotherapy). This wig was everything I could have asked for! Not only is it incredibly affordable, but it looked beautiful and realistic (definitely not overly-shiny or dull)! I actually received compliments on my hair from people who didn&#x27;t realize I was wearing a wig (and from people who did). It is a very long wig (I am 5&#x27;3&#x27;&#x27; and it reached my waist) so I had to trim it a bit and it also gets tangled fairly easily, but both of these obstacles are easily overcome with proper maintenance. One critique I do have is that to me it looked more like a chocolate brown shade in person, not really a dark brown. However, maybe I just consider &amp;#34;dark brown&amp;#34; to be nearly black, which is what my natural hair color is. Even though the color was a little lighter than I thought, this wig is gorgeous and is definitely worth the price!</li>
            <li> This wig is absolutely gorgeous I love how when I do cart wheels and stuff it does fall off I&#x27;ve had no troubles with the tangles it just like real hair it tangles. Very long but I am going to keep it that way too gorgeous to ruin I&#x27;m gonna love wearing this in front of my whole school!!!</li>
            <li> I absolutely loved this wig! It arrived quickly and neatly packaged. The quality of the wig is excelent and looks great! Everytime I wear it people can&#x27;t tell I have a wig on, girls rather ask where I got my &amp;#34;extensions&amp;#34; from. Little do they know its a wig! I&#x27;ve only had it for a few months so I don&#x27;t know how long lasting it is but if it ever gets ruined I will definitely re purchase it.</li>
            <li> This is a great wig for occasional use, this wig needs a lot of care and the quality gets poor later on</li>
            <li> This a wonderful change of pace. My hair is naturally long and blonde and I wanted to have some fun with something new. The hair is soft and pretty and depending on the lighting looks totally real. I am completely happy with it!</li>
            <li> Brush the wig before and after use. put it on your head and hold the hair in your hand, squeezing tight and then begin brushing the ends and work your way up to the nape of the neck. Take it off and brush the back and bangs. I would suggest a rubber bristled brush. Very long, the look is natural, the feel is sub-par but if you want a wig to wear around every once in a while, this is for you!</li>
            <li> Came much faster than I expected. It looks great and fits alright. My only issue is wearing it so it looks ok. I&#x27;m new to wigs and I can&#x27;t figure out the parting :c</li>
            <li> It looked real and it was soft. When I wore it, everyone said I looked hot ^_^ it does tangle a little, but for me, it was easy to untangle.</li>
            <li> I think this is the best wig I have ever owned. I was expecting some cheap quality POS but this wig is so flattering. I can brush it and style it exactly the way I want. It isn&#x27;t itchy like most cheap wigs and makes me feel beautiful.</li>
            <li> This wig is excellent &amp; beautiful! I purchased it for my Halloween costume and people thought it was my real hair! I was worried because I have a pretty big head, but it fit great! :)</li>
            <li> This wig might as well have been bought in the Halloween section of a drugstore. Cheap. Doesn&#x27;t look like the photo or lay like that. Waste.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really pretty hair, it looks real! The hair lining is ridiculous though. I could not get the wig to stay on my head, I tried using bobby pins everything. looked up ways to keep it on, nothing worked. The WORST part is the hair lining it&#x27;s so awkward and messed up. Maybe my head was to big for the wig to stay on. I guess it&#x27;s worth a shot, but I cut mine because it was so long so I couldn&#x27;t return it.</li>
            <li> I am a little disappointed. The bangs are sooo long and when you push them aside, the wig separates and you can see the netting. The hair itself is nice. It&#x27;s very pretty. I think I might try to trim the bangs, I just can&#x27;t wear it the way it is.</li>
            <li> Came dry and not as expected! Lasted 3days!</li>
            <li> I got this to cover my colored hair at my job. I get compliments every day on how beautiful my hair is. If I tell them it&#x27;s a wig they can&#x27;t believe it. It&#x27;s pretty comfortable. I wear it 8 hours a day and it doesn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
            <li> It was very nice. Loved it, and easy to slip on.. but it does knot easily and hard to brush or comb through...</li>
            <li> Received product midday a day early. The box came as reported: wig, wig cap, comb.  The color was not as dark as I thought it would be; however it compliments my complexion in a copper brown color.  It is really beautiful, I like the color.  The waves are loose as stated and it is very long, approx. 28-30 inches, which is 2-4 inches longer than my other wigs.  I used the wig cap with the wig but really didn&#x27;t need it as the wig fits very snugly and comfortably but the wig cap can only fortify the fit, if indeed it is used. Since this is my first purchase with MelodySusie, I may follow up in the near future for an update. But so far, so good. And, yes, I would recommend this wig.</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t expect this quality from a synthetic wig, but this one is surprisingly natural-looking. Much longer than I expected, and a beautiful shade of brown. Excellent costume wig.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve never had a wig, this is the wig for you. It is perfect for beginners. Cheap and good enough to look real. It tangles and sheds, and you will probably have to replace it at some point. But it is definitely worth it. I think if you take good care of it, it can last at least a few months, which is very good for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the first wig I have ever bought. I was looking into extensions and wigs because I am trying to grow out my hair, but I always end up getting bored of my hairstyle and end up cutting it short. I&#x27;ve been in that cycle for a few years now and really want to get out of it so I can grow long hair. So I bought this to change my look whenever I get bored of my hair. I bought the color FP718 Dark Brown Long Curly.</li>
            <li> I bought this wig to go with my halloween costume and it was perfect. Great quality and fit well. I will definitely consider this brand again.</li>
            <li> great quality and arrived fast!</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for!</li>
            <li> I just got my wig today and it is awesome! Looks really natural. The only weird part are the bangs but if you pin them back you can make them look really good. When you get it, shake it out some. It brushes very easily. I haven&#x27;t worn it out yet but I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll get some compliments on it. It comes with a comb and a wig cap! Which I thought was pretty neat haha. If you&#x27;re not sure just buy it. Totally worth more than it costed. It was really soft too.</li>
            <li> great deal!!! looks real and easy to put on.</li>
            <li> This wig is cute for dress up but does not look as real as I thought it would.</li>
            <li> This is my first wig because my hair is rapidly falling out. I used it on a date night with my husband he said it looked amazing! He couldn&#x27;t even tell he said it completely changed how I looked!&lt;br /&gt; It comes with it&#x27;s own brush and it&#x27;s own mesh skull cap so you don&#x27;t need to order one like I did. Comb it before you put it on your head though. I learned that the hard way. Unless you secure it but then again this is my first wig and loved it so much that I ordered others and have been doing research. This is a great first wig but there was a cap end hanging out right at the part and it was hard to tuck under when I noticed it and wasn&#x27;t in my bathroom to fix. Other than that I would totally recommend this for first time users then try some extensions and full lace/front lace. Because I&#x27;m TOTALLY hooked now.</li>
            <li> This is my first time ever buying a wig. I bought this wig with one that cost a little more (From Cool 2 day-think that&#x27;s the name) and this wig was worth the purchase of both on it&#x27;s own.  Looks natural, I am naturally a dark brown brunette with some medium brown at the ends.  I wanted something that if I wore it, no one would wonder/question if I were wearing a wig.  I have started thinning a lot on the sides of my head (above the ear area) and the scalp.  When your hair is thinning enough it makes going without shampooing your hair for a couple of day even more difficult.  I find when I perspire on my scalp that the hair tends to stick together and I get that &amp;#34;greasy&amp;#34; look just after one day.  So, I thought getting a wig would help and if I want to dress up I could just throw it on.  When I got it I put it on right away.  My son and husband did not even notice (I also have long hair) just thought I got a hair cut and styled.  The dark brown is not really that dark.  It is dark enough took look like my hair, but has lots of brown tones to it.  I did not have to cut the bangs, just play with them til you get them the way you like it.  I did cut the length.  The length would be the only possible sign that it could not be &amp;#34;real&amp;#34;.  Just 2 inches off.  I Skyped  with my brother who is away from home and he could not tell, he was shocked when I told him a few days later.  He knows I have been upset with my hair loss, I had always had beautiful long hair.  Still have the long hair, but just thinning on top, not a cute look.  This wig has made me feel like I can be in public again without being self conscious.  I will buy another MelodySusie wig due to the quality of this one.  I don&#x27;t think I would buy the Cool2Day brand again.</li>
            <li> I love the wig it looks real c: although i hide the part with a beanie because it looks weird</li>
            <li> I bought a couple of wigs off of Amazon on a whim, including this one. I like to keep my hair pixie-short and wanted to be able to play with longer styles without having to grow out my hair. I thought there was no way I&#x27;d actually wear a wig that cost less than $20 in public, but when I put it on, I was stunned to see how convincing it looks!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s VERY long (down to my butt). I feel that this is a bonus because it&#x27;s easy to cut it shorter, but you can&#x27;t exactly grow a wig out if you want it longer. I&#x27;ll be trimming mine because the length gets in the way, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, this wig came with a wig comb and wig cap, which was GREAT for someone just starting to explore wigs like I am. The care instructions are also very helpful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely buy this again and recommend it to my friends.</li>
            <li> The shipping and everything was great, but this wig looked too fake on.  I had to send it back and get a refund.</li>
            <li> It was really long.  Had to trim it.  It tangled easily.  Great for cosplay</li>
            <li> Wig is okay, basically you get like one wear out of it. Arrived on time but starting shedding immediately out of the bag. Looks like a wig not real hair. Costume wig</li>
            <li> I love this wig and the color matches my real hair. I put this on and my friends thought  it was real. Definitely worth  the money. The bangs are a little long but nothing a Bobby pin can&#x27;t fix. :)</li>
            <li> Bangs are horrible. every thing about this wig looks fake. I will be returning this. Highly disappointed and disgusted. The only thing that it&#x27;s nice is the color</li>
            <li> I bought this wig and I love it but the ends dry up almost immediately and need trimming. All in all its a great style and u can&#x27;t tell its a wig.. I would still buy it again. All synthetic hair ends up drying out so no matter who u buy from that will be a problem. Love it!!</li>
            <li> This is a decent product for the price. The wig was a tad lighter than the picture but I do not mind since this is something you can expect when shopping with pictures online -and the color is still very pretty! It was packaged and shipped right after I ordered so it arrived lighting fast, which is an added star to this review. It is packaged very nice and I appreciate the comb and wig cap that came with. It was very long so I trimmed it down a few inches. I also felt it was a but shiny but I used some dry spay shampoo to dull it down and it looks much more natural now. Cute with headbands and hats!</li>
            <li> I was weary to buy a wig online, but after reading so many wonderful reviews I decided to try it. I was NOT disappointed in the least. The wig looks very realistic, it&#x27;s a bit long, but I&#x27;m having it trimmed. My sister is a stylist, and when I told her what I paid for the wig she was blown away! Great value for the money!</li>
            <li> Its almost a bit too thick, doesn&#x27;t look very natural. Its a little different than the photo, but after straightening a few spots I made it work. Looks really cute with a beanie, and hides some of the over puffiness of the bangs.</li>
            <li> It is a very good quality wig! Very pretty but it was a bit too long I trimmed the bottom and i was set to go! Fabulous!</li>
            <li> I am a hair stylist. I wasn&#x27;t expecting an undetectable hair piece but this wig got great reviews so I was expecting to be marginally entertained. The texture of the hair is all wrong. It&#x27;s thick and heavy, like a bad shag faux fur coat from the 1975 film Dolemite. I have felt nice synthetic hair but this one feels like box colored coarse gray hair; it is very stiff and gritty. For reference, the color matches to Redken&#x27;s 4Gb. I am currently hanging the wig to see if the curls will relax and hang more naturally. Will update.</li>
            <li> For the price this wig is better than the one I spent $200 on!</li>
            <li> This wig is worth every penny. Thank you.</li>
            <li> The MelodySusie wigs are the best.  My wife like&#x27;s them better than her $200+ wig.  They are by far the best value wig anywhere.</li>
            <li> Very nice looking Enough hair to trim up to fit your style. For the price, really Not bad at all.  The part is a bit hard to design around but otherwise a great purchase and fast shipping</li>
            <li> Wore this for a performance once. Fell in love with the long hair.</li>
            <li> Very prompt. I felt like I had just ordered it when it showed up at my front door.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> This wig is so freaking cute! I want another one in more colors!</li>
            <li> Pretty good quality for the price! A bit shiny, not super full. But for about $15 it&#x27;s a pretty good deal.</li>
            <li> Love my wig. Fit great and looks very real and classy. Gives a great sexy look:) very happy with it!</li>
            <li> I love this wig! It&#x27;s a great fit and looks real. I like to dress up for conventions and everyone thinks it is my actual hair. I like that it is nice and thick.</li>
            <li> I was really excited when I got this wig in the mail because it got great reviews.&lt;br /&gt;I put it on and the the size-adjustment strap broke!! I&#x27;m so mad and I want my money back.</li>
            <li> Pros&lt;br /&gt;The packaging was nice.&lt;br /&gt;The shipping quick&lt;br /&gt;The return was quick and easy.&lt;br /&gt;If the wig that I received was like the pic then I would have loved it &amp; I wouldn&#x27;t returned it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;The color wasn&#x27;t the color I had ordered.&lt;br /&gt;The hair tangles pretty fast&lt;br /&gt;The pics is much better that the product i received,</li>
            <li> This wig actually exceeded my expectations.  For the ridiculously low price, it is extremely lifelike. Lovely,  bouncy curls, and a fashionably enviable length.&lt;br /&gt;The only drawback is that, like with any long hairpiece, it gets tangled quickly and easily. After a few wears I had used it for all it was worth -- then I cut it to a more manageable length amd wore it a few more times.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice wig with flattering bangs and natural color. Has a built in adjustable cap to keep it on your head. I bought one similar to this before and paid a lot more for it!</li>
            <li> It tangle up the same day , well for the price it was alright, but I won&#x27;t suggest to anyone</li>
            <li> This wig is a lot of fun...leave everyone guessing if it&#x27;s real or not!  I wore it out a few times and it looks completely natural.  You will turn a bunch of heads with it.  After a few wears it does start to get a bit frizzy but some light combing does the trick.</li>
            <li> I really enjoyed getting this wig. It took about a week for it to come in the mail. I use it to dress up and have had a really good time looking like a woman. I would like to get it in a darker color. The brown is too light for me as I have really dark brown skin.</li>
            <li> Do not buy!&lt;br /&gt;arrived tanged with a comb in a box which had been opened/used.&lt;br /&gt;i am requesting my $ back. Dont waste your time.&lt;br /&gt;thin and straggy long in the back but tanged and matted&lt;br /&gt;short bangs and absoutely  stye keep your $10 add $70 and get a real wig.</li>
            <li> Ok, wig arrived on time. I received a wig cap and wig comb in the box as well.  Right out of the box the wig was pretty limp and lacked some serious volume! I hung it upside down for a couple days and when I put it on it was perfect! It&#x27;s long and natural looking.  My husband&#x27;s niece who is a who dresser thought it was my real hair! And everywhere I went men were looking! And I&#x27;m not exaggerating, buy it and see for yourself! I will buy more! Love love this wig.  Will post a pic as well.</li>
            <li> This wig is awesome and looks so natural and feels so soft to touch.  No one can believe the transformation from my natural blonde to this beautiful brunette.  Can&#x27;t wait for my other orders to come in.</li>
            <li> I recently cut my hair short and miss long hair so much some days, I&#x27;ve worn this more than a few times out and nobody knows the difference! The length and curls are beautiful. It doesn&#x27;t have that synthetic shine and came with everything listed. Will buy from seller again. :)</li>
            <li> Very pretty! It sheds quite a bit, but i was expecting that. It still lasted several months for me and I would likely buy this again c:</li>
            <li> I love this wig, looks like natural hair. Fits great,  waves are perfect, im 5&#x27;6 and it touches me butt. So worth the money. Better then any 100.00 wig ive purchased. Worth the money</li>
            <li> Received many compliments when I wore it.  Nice curl to the ends, bangs hang well.  Fits well.  Came with skull cap thing and comb.  Great wig.</li>
            <li> Amazing!  I&#x27;ve worn wigs for 30 years and this is the best synthetic I&#x27;ve ever purchased.</li>
            <li> It is soft,comfy,and looks real. i am a teen and in high school. last year i got a bery horibble hair cut and j got teasesd about it. this wig makes me feel really comfident and pretty. i will buy more products from Melody Susie</li>
            <li> This was a great wig! Great quality and detangles easily. I used this wig in a cosplay. It was very easy to slip on when wearing a wig cap.</li>
            <li> Curvier than pictured but relaxed and looked more like the picture. Great wig even for beginners. Looked very natural even over my thick hair.</li>
            <li> Best wig I have ever bought so far it feels and looks real it doesn&#x27;t get knotted up easy to brush just all around beautiful and it came super fast</li>
            <li> Came on time horrible product</li>
            <li> Bangs tend to fall into my eyes but I guess thats what long hair does? Whatever, looks real, stays in place, easy to comb, curls are staying strong thus far. No complaints.</li>
            <li> This wig feels sOO nice, comfortable and shiny love it</li>
            <li> Love this wig. Looks beautiful. Decent quality for the price. Fun to dress up. Don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;d wear it out in public. Haven&#x27;t had the guts to anyway.</li>
            <li> I WOULD RATE MORE THAN 5 STARS IF POSSIBLE. This wig is literally just as silky and easy to fit as a 100+ dollars. I&#x27;ve never been happier from buying something online.</li>
            <li> Awesome high quality synthetic wig!! Will definitely be purchasing more.</li>
            <li> Okay,i&#x27;d have to say i love this wig. I just started wearing it and im loving it..its really soft..softer than i expected for the price. Its really long at the back but i work with that.</li>
            <li> When I first got the wig in the mail and put it on. It looked fake, but as I got used to it and styled it around it looked soooo good and real!! The quality is amazing! The color was definitely lighter than dark brown and didn&#x27;t match my hair color but it still looked really good. My brother thought I died my hair and didn&#x27;t even realize it was a wig haha. The wig is pretty small and i have a small head but i try to fit the wig onto my head as best i can. i hope they make it bigger!</li>
            <li> I received my wig on time! However, when I received it it was a mess of tangles and shedded everywhere while I combed it. Since it was cheaper than most wigs, I was expecting this. It also doesn&#x27;t look realistic. It doesn&#x27;t have a realistic part, its very voluminous which adds a cartoony look to it, and its shiny. I had to trim it up a bit to make it look right but other than these few flaws, its a good wig to wear on a date/job interview/to school and is worth its price.</li>
            <li> this is too small seems like it would be for a child instead of an adult, too small do not buy</li>
            <li> This wig is beyond amazing. far exceeded my expectations for the price. decently thick, and very soft. feels realistic, and its very long. i LOVE it. will definitely be buying from this seller again.</li>
            <li> Was pretty, tangled easily though.Worth the money though</li>
            <li> This wig is of the best quality. I have had it for over a year now, and it is still in great condition. I do not wear it everyday, but I have worn it often. It was quite long though. I did have to cut the bangs shorter, and after wearing it long a few times I cut the back a bit shorter to fit my style. Cap can be adjusted and fit great, no slips.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m someone who loves to dye her hair ridiculous colors, and my work recently got a new boss who says no more colors! I didn&#x27;t want to change it, so I decided to try outa wig. Ive never worn one before, and I have ALOT of natural hair that has to be held beneath it. It came in a beautiful box, with a wig comb, wig cap, and of course, the wig itself. The first time I wore it was a bit awkward, but I sworn it a lot now and it&#x27;s definitely what I needed.</li>
            <li> I love this wig, I have never been a wig wearer but love the clips in back that you can adjust it to size it smaller.  I put a pic of myself on facebook wearing this. and all my friends were telling me &#x27;Great color\\&quot; ;&#x27;nice color choice&#x27; You look beautiful, ect......Most people seemed to think I dyed my hair, no one seemed to notice it grew at least a foot. LOL&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a week or 2 of wearing it on and off for several days, it has become quite tangled in back. I tried to brush the tangles out with infusium, but the synthetic product the hair is made out of does not effect it at all. Make sure if you brush, brush your wig lightly and try to reform the curls it came with. Mine was  so tangled in back I have several large strands that are just long and black (frizzled) I try to curl it by hand and reshape it and it does help. I also had to clip off some really frizzed ends of the hair. I also cut the bangs a tad which makes it easier to manage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay so I really liked it in the beginning I still like it, but some of the hair in back is just not the same, How long should a wig last? what is wig glue? should I get a foam head to set it on, will this help keep its shape? I don&#x27;t know the answers to these questions., however if you do let me know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel happy enough that if I can make it last a month I would buy another one to keep replacing it with. Thats how much I like the style. However if I am going have to buy a new one every month or 2 is it good quality? I don&#x27;t know. Like I said I like the style, but to keep this style a whole year and buy 6 more of them I think I should get a discount.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I wish there was a wig of the month club, you know like a wine of the month club. LOL, you just choose which one you wanna try and if you like it then you keep getting same style or change it up! That would be awesome, however I will just be happy if they offer me a discount, as I am going to have to get another one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think anyone that finds the wig attractive by the pic alone will love this product. You can wear it just like the model is or style it differently its great!e that finds the wig attractive by the pic alone will love this product. You can wear it just like the model is or style it differently its great!</li>
            <li> Made from real human hair! this is really great! makes me look like a real long-haired lady.</li>
            <li> I use a lot of wigs for photo shoots and don&#x27;t want to spend a lot of money for them.  This wig is the best quality I have found yet, especially for the price.  I can&#x27;t speak to the issue of styling it as I plan to use it as it is, but it is exactly what I wanted for a better price than I could have imagined.</li>
            <li> Horrible product! My fiancé laughed his head off when he saw me with this wig on!&lt;br /&gt;Do not buy unless you are looking for a costume wig!</li>
            <li> I give this a 3-star rating for a few reasons:&lt;br /&gt;1: the wig gives your head an awkward shape.&lt;br /&gt;2: it&#x27;s more of a southern belle, kind of look.&lt;br /&gt;3: it&#x27;s almost virtually impossible to keep it untangled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wouldn&#x27;t wear it in public, unless it was for a costume party or Halloween.&lt;br /&gt;Good for a quick selfie.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:moDAW225G1TECE]]I bought this as a birthday gift for my girlfriend. She was so surprised when she got this little gift since she is so crazy about wigs. She has many wigs in different color and length but this one is the best ever, with its natural color and soft feeling. It&#x27;s quite gorgeous on my girlfriend.  It was well packed when I got it, with its own box in the outer box. The wig was in a plastic bag and it also came with a comb and a cap. It&#x27; really amazing to me that the seller sent these for free as my girlfriend always needs to buy the extra the wig cap since these no cap of the wig she bought before. And this cap looks good; the size seems quite suitable for my girlfriend.  The little cap can help collect her own hair and make it easier to wear the wig since she has a short hair. There&#x27;s also a buckle to help fasten the wig to your head. It seems easy to wear for my girl friendly, and it fix well even in a wind.  I never bought a wig online because I really worry about the quality and the color and something like this. But I finally got one since it was so hot. Of course I checked with it carefully after I got this wig. You know I felt really amazing and I really think it&#x27;s a wig with high quality, because I found no stitches or lines in the root that obviously showed from the wig design. And about the cover of the inner side, it&#x27;s quite exquisite in every detail. I really like the color of the wig, which is really a dark brown, but I think it&#x27;s not that shiny as the pic, it&#x27;s much darker and looks more real, but it could be shiny under the sun. Almost all of our friends think it looks like my girlfriend&#x27;s own hair when she wearing it.  The only down side is it got kinda tangled after wearing times, but it&#x27;s not as bad though. I know this is really a problem for all of the wigs, especially the curly one and if not properly taken care of, it&#x27;ll tangle fast.  About cleaning and maintenance, I suggest that cleaning could be done about every 15-30 days, which is helpful to keep your wig glossy and soft, but not too often. And don&#x27;t spray any gel water or hair Vaseline into your wig. And you know sunlight is kinda harmful to wigs, it need to be away from direct sunlight if you are not wearing it. You can just follow the tips on the box to take care of your wig, which is professional and easy.  I am fully satisfied with this purchase and of course my girlfriend love it very much, thank you Melodysusie! And if you are a girl in the market of long curly wig, I really recommend this one for you!  Updated: This Halloween, I got the red one, very impressed with the package. Better than ever!</li>
            <li> I was worried about buying this, I buzzed off my long gorgeous blonde hair in a pregnancy break down moment and I regret it! I figured if I get a wig, it should be as close to my natural hair as possible and this wig seemed to good to be true so I waited a couple weeks to decide. I am beyond satisfied! It looks real to anyone who doesn&#x27;t know me without it! I feel fabulous, it looks great. This is day 2 and it still looks stunning! When it starts getting ragity, I&#x27;m buying it again!!!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t believe this wig was less than $20! You can&#x27;t find a good Halloween wig for that price! It was very realistic looking and not at all shiny. The only thing I didn&#x27;t care for was that it is so long, but that is easy to fix with a good pair of shears :)</li>
            <li> i am very pleased with the product quailty with the price I paid for. Not a bad low price wig to try if you just looking for cosplay. If you wanna make it everyday wear, then I properly recommend a hat or some hair accessories to make it more realstic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is no problem with the quanlity of the hair, just the front part are a little fake, but I fix it with some hair accessories, it works greats.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Black is more realstic. :)</li>
            <li> great looking . I ordered one black and on brown the brown is darker than the pic shown. and if u have a big head u will have to fiddle with making it fit and look good</li>
            <li> This wig will be great for Halloween.  As costume wigs go, it&#x27;s a very good quality.  However, based on the reviews I was expecting something with a more realistic feel.  Good for the price, but far from amazing.</li>
            <li> This is fantasy hair! I bought this wig for Halloween but ended up wearing it to a party. Everyone loved it! I liked the color (a dark cherry brown) and the texture (not cheap feeling!). It came with a wig cap and a wig comb. My only thought on improvement is that it is very long, so you may want to cut some length.</li>
            <li> Poor quality I received over a month open box look at it and push it in a corner to donate</li>
            <li> I got the wig a couple of days ago, and have been trying to make it work. It has a couple bald patches around the crown area, and the bangs don&#x27;t seem to be in any kind of shape. When i do try to part the bangs in anyway you can see the under part and it looks like broken hair or fuzz. I love the feel of the hair, but it came tangled, and I am trying to figure out a gentle way of fixing that as well. I believe i would be really happy with this wig had it come as many of the others described theirs. The package did however come on time and with everything listed. I believe this may just be a fluke since so many others have had great experiences with theirs.</li>
            <li> This wig is gorgeous considering the price I paid for it. I even took pics for my Facebook in it and got a bunch of  likes. Its does tangle a bit but thats to be expected with all synthetic hair. To control that I just went ahead snipped it because it was extremely long and I still take pics in it :)</li>
            <li> Pros: Super fast shipping... but that&#x27;s what I pay for Amazon Prime for.&lt;br /&gt;  True color&lt;br /&gt;  Free cap &amp; comb&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: The bangs are AWEFUL. They can&#x27;t be styled, so I had to use a headband to pull them out of my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;  The length is a little too much and the ends get tangled easily. I ended up having to cut about 4 inches off when I couldn&#x27;t get the comb through.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over all, it&#x27;s a wig worth it&#x27;s price. If you want a cheap wig, this is it. But just remember... you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> High quality, plus extras ...wig cap and wig comb.</li>
            <li> This is a great wig for the price. It&#x27;s fun &amp; glamorous, and looks real. It&#x27;s a bit long, but it looks so real, that doesn&#x27;t even matter. If you want to get glammed up buy this wig. I uploaded a pic so you can see.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this for post-chemo baldness and likely I will wear it on special occasions only, or braid it and wear it with a hat for everyday use. It&#x27;s not the type of wig you can just throw on and run out of the house in, you&#x27;ll need to dress up and style the wig. But it will be worth it!l&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(update) It&#x27;s a very comfortable, natural-looking wig; I wear it all the time now and I adore it. It requires very little upkeep and does not tangle. I can&#x27;t recommend this wig highly enough!!!</li>
            <li> I just received my order and I absolutely am in love! It arrived in less than two days. I&#x27;m so amazed at the quality of this wig it literally blew me away. It is so soft and super long. I&#x27;m 5 foot 7 and it reaches my butt. It is not shiny or ratty like others. The price is amazing. Thank you to melodysusie I absolutely love love love this wig and am more than happy.</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying that, this is my first time ever buying or putting on a wig in my life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like it! I have no hair, I bleached it to death and just decided to shave it all off in an attempt to regrow my natural hair and have it be healthy again. I am a month in and I already miss having hair so I bought this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I combed it out (the comb sucks) I gave up and did a big no no and brushed this sucker...some of the curls held up perfectly, some didn&#x27;t. If you like to flip your hair from side to side or play with it a lot(like I do)...prepare for ratty tangles. In my opinion, the tangles kind of make it look more like real hair, so that&#x27;s a good thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The part is a little funny, but nothing a cute head band or some distraction/styling can&#x27;t fix..I stuck a bow on it and called it a day ;) It&#x27;s really cute in a low pony tail, and the length was not outrageous (I am 5&#x27;1 it came down to about an inch above my belly button) but I trimmed it anyway to underboob length. I&#x27;m a short fat girl so it just made me look shorter and fatter at that length. This would be even cuter if it was cut into a bob. I might even buy another one just to do that. The hair is soft...but it doesn&#x27;t really feel like human hair, which is fine by me..it isn&#x27;t overly shiny like some wigs are. I&#x27;m a rambler so I&#x27;m just going to stop right here and make a pros/cons list to save us both some time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Looks believable if you get it on your head just right and you&#x27;re not LOOKING for signs of a wig (aside from the part)&lt;br /&gt;The length and curls are nice&lt;br /&gt;The adjustable strap was fantastic ( I THOUGHT I had a big head, but I have it on the smallest setting and that is perfect)&lt;br /&gt;Even when you brush it (violently) it holds up okay&lt;br /&gt;The color was pretty ( I got dark brown, it&#x27;s more of a medium/dark)&lt;br /&gt;Easy to throw in a low pony tail and forget it&#x27;s on your head.&lt;br /&gt;Fast shipping&lt;br /&gt;Decent packaging&lt;br /&gt;Soft(mostly)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Tangles easily&lt;br /&gt;Strange part&lt;br /&gt;A bit itchy, but this might not be avoidable (see above: Wig Virgin)&lt;br /&gt;A bit hot (USE THE CAP) I have no hair and it still felt so much better with the cap on&lt;br /&gt;Might have to trim&lt;br /&gt;Sheds a little (but I&#x27;m pretty rough, so it could just be me going barbarian on it with my brush)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, for the $18 I spent on my first wig, this was a great deal!e above: Wig Virgin)  A bit hot (USE THE CAP) I have no hair and it still felt so much better with the cap on  Might have to trim  Sheds a little (but I&#x27;m pretty rough, so it could just be me going barbarian on it with my brush)    All in all, for the $18 I spent on my first wig, this was a great deal!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s QUITE long and layered, which means that the bottom layer looks extremely wispy and thin at first. I initially didn&#x27;t like the wig because of this and because of how tightly curled it was, however, after trimming up the bottom layer and brushing it out, I ended up liking it very, very much! The hair really is surprisingly thick once you match the bottom layer to the rest, and after gently brushing it, it looks just like the preview pic.</li>
            <li> See how the pics don&#x27;t show the top part ? It&#x27;s because the wig is super volumous and make your head big! Returning..</li>
            <li> I ordered this for a Halloween costume with pretty low expectations due to the price.  I was so thrilled, then, to receive a really nice quality wig!  The product is great and I will definitely order wigs from them again when I need them.</li>
            <li> Beautiful wig... Looks real. I posted a picture on fb where a friend thought I was showing off the headband I was wearing not realizing I was talking about my new wig.. Just not liking the bang area yet. Came sooner than expected.</li>
            <li> It arrived QUICKLY, which is awesome, I was a bit surprised at how long the wig was on me, but nonetheless, I like it. I bought this originally for a cosplay but it is SO natural looking that I might end up wearing it occasionally! I even posted a pic on here on how it looks on me in general. VERY good, would recommend!</li>
            <li> Fun wig, doesn&#x27;t shed!!!</li>
            <li> all is good i like it i will buy again from this seller. good delivery well timed also material good and as described. also well seal an protected.</li>
            <li> I bought this specifically for home use; I did not wear it in public.  It was fun to do something a little different, and the wig looks realistic enough.  It was super long - like to the top of my butt, but the great part is that you can trim it to whatever length you want.  I loved the sexy waves but cut it to the middle of my back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure I personally would ever wear this in public, but you could probably pull it off.  You just need to take some time to come it and style it.  The only downside is the bangs part.  It is NOT as pictured and needs some finesse with the wig comb to make things look natural there.</li>
            <li> Amazing quality for the price.  I have no idea what the complainers are expecting for this price--real hair????  It even comes with a hair net.</li>
            <li> Really surprised I liked this wig so much, because my hopes were low at this price! It was way too long to look good on me at first, so I trimmed up the length a bit, and had to trim the bangs, too. With those adjustments done, this wig looks very natural and the waves are nice. Hair is not too plastic-looking, I don&#x27;t think most people know it&#x27;s a wig. My biggest complaint is that it tangles so easily and it&#x27;s hard to comb out once it gets tangly.</li>
            <li> I bought 2 wigs from this brand a while back and I gotta say I loved it at first! It was fun to go from blond, to brown, and to black hair that always confused the costumers at my work. But later on the ends starts to tangle and I use the cleansing products from my work, Sally, that&#x27;s design for wigs but it wasn&#x27;t helping with the tangles. So I started using my own softening shampoos/conditioners and it kind of help. But it kept getting tangle and the ends started to go bad so I just kept cutting the ends short and I couldn&#x27;t deal with it. Personally I&#x27;m just so use to human hair than synthetics. In the end, I just gave them to a friend of mind who&#x27;s like a pro with synthetic wigs unlike me lol.</li>
            <li> I like the product, but it tooks like a real wig! I mean I look gay wearing it. So I&#x27;m just giving it a 3 star. But if you love wigs this is a perfect product for you</li>
            <li> This was the best wig.  I bought this for a halloween party and it didn&#x27;t disappoint.  Very nice quality at a nice price.</li>
            <li> Very soft, looks real! Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This wig is so beautiful! my only complaint with it is that it tangles easily and the curls tend to fall out when you comb it.</li>
            <li> It does really look and feel like real hair. The wig is kind of small though for most people I think. I had to style this a while to get the bangs to look like the picture. This wig way longer than I would have thought so we had to end up shorting it a bit.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very nice but it gets tangled way to quickly</li>
            <li> Very shiny . Not a fan of it</li>
            <li> Absolutely lovely! Very pleased with this product. Very thick, soft, natural feeling hair at a great great great price. Would recommend to anybody and everbody, whether you wear wigs often or not since it&#x27;s such a nice, easy way to change your look and feel good about yourself. For me, given the price, the extra wig cap and comb are like little gifts, and I thought that was really nice :) This is just an all around great buy, and has made me very happy. MelodieSusie definitely knows how to run a business, and I&#x27;ll definitely be back next paycheck! (Just don&#x27;t tell my boyfriend ;p)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: Do remember that it is a wig and that it does require special care, so take care of it well!</li>
            <li> I received this 3 days after I ordered, live in SoCal as well, so I was happy with the shipping speed! Everything that was included did come in the packaging. I&#x27;m around 5&#x27;5&amp;#34; and 5&#x27;6&amp;#34; and it reaches the bottom half of my back. The wig itself was in really good condition, except for a few stray hairs, but nothing the comb couldn&#x27;t fix. A little shinier than I prefer, but not too bad. I also have a bigger head, and it fit perfectly, so that was a relief haha. Definitely a great purchase!</li>
            <li> A very good product, complete with hair net. My wife wore the wig to a costume party and received many compliments. She was impressed with the quality and look of the wig. A good product.</li>
            <li> I love this wig! I actually bought two of them, one curly, one straight, and I&#x27;m thinking about buying a 3rd one to cut shorter! The price is awesome for the quality. It looks so real and I get compliments on it every time I go out. The only thing bad about it is it does get tangled and frizzy easily. But I keep it moisturized with argan oil and keep it washed, brushed, and curled/straightened with heat protector to take good care of it and keep it from getting too tangled and matted. Totally worth the buy!</li>
            <li> The quality of the wig is beautiful -- with one major flaw.  The cap is visible at the part line, and I couldn&#x27;t hide it, no matter how I combed or styled the wig.  The hair simply does not cover at this location, and this makes the wig look, well, like an obvious wig.  On top of that, apparently this item is not eligible for returns (something that was not clear to me at the time of purchase).  Two stars for the quality of the rest of the wig, but major thumbs down for the visible under-cap at the part line.</li>
            <li> Great Wig... Love it!</li>
            <li> All I can say is wow! I&#x27;m not a big wearer of wigs other than for Halloween but I recently had to cut my hair really short which kinda killed my self esteem, and to help boost it I got this wig. I think it looks amazing. It feels great and doesn&#x27;t look cheap or anything. It was a bit long and so I cut it but I love it! I may buy another one for when this one gets old.</li>
            <li> Really nice wig for the price. Is comfortable and soft</li>
            <li> You get what you get for the price you pay.it was way to long and tangled way to easy and wig shampoo did not help.</li>
            <li> Its definitely as long as it is in the picture, though the color is not as brown. Its more like a grayish-brown color. Overall good product.</li>
            <li> wig is ok, you get what you pay for.  first off the wig was jammed into the box and when i took it out, i had to untangle it.  after letting it sit a few days to fall into shape, i was able to finally see the wig as it was meant to be. however, the curls did not hold their shape.  and the tangles hair had to be cut out and i had to reset the curls.  all in all, the wig is not what i thought it would be.</li>
            <li> I received my wig today and there are some pro&#x27;s and Con&#x27;s. The color and feeling of the wig are nice. It was a pleasant surprise to get a comb and wig cap also. The only drawback is the front of it isn&#x27;t really what is pictured. It was very hard to style. It&#x27;s also allot thinner than I expected. I will not be keeping this wig and instead will have it styled and given to a friend that is currently undergoing chemo. Bummed:(</li>
            <li> It Looks absolutely amazing! Love it!</li>
            <li> Love it looks like real hair and feels like it to!</li>
            <li> This wig is exxactly like the picture shows,color,curls,texture.  Wow what a bargan for the money. If you want a wig for little money that feels so life like this is it.  the fit is perfect, the look is even better. and Talk about on time , they were right on. Delivery was perfect. Thank you so much will definately order another one.</li>
            <li> For the price, this wig is incredible. Easy to use and quite comfortable.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised by this wig! The shine of the hair is quite natural and the hair is fairly thick. It even includes with a wig cap, a wig comb, and wig care instructions. I bought it for $18.88 which was well worth it, but I would not pay the full $39.99.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my roommate, she liked it a lot.Designed very well for someone with a small/average head. One caveat: If you wear wigs daily, be warned: it dries it up quickly.</li>
            <li> The packaging was great, it came with a wig comb and a cap, the hair has a very realistic finish, very comfortable adjustable cap and it looks really natural. Shipping was fast too, very happy with my purchase!!</li>
            <li> I love this wig! My only problem is that I am new to the wig world and sure wish it came with better instructions. I love the color and everyone thinks it is my natural hair because it is so close in cold and texture to my natural hair.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item on December 29th and the estimated delivery date was January 4th and I got it right on time !&lt;br /&gt;It is a really long wig though. I&#x27;m 5&#x27;8 1/2 and the wig went down to my belly button so I ended up cutting it to my collar bone.&lt;br /&gt;I think it looks really beautiful ! My brother walked in and asked if I went and got my hair done because it looked so nice. It does tangle very easily&lt;br /&gt;but there&#x27;s nothing a wide-toothed comb can&#x27;t do. I would definitely recommend this wig !</li>
            <li> Not wonderful but not terrible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very fast shipping to my home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It would be a good wig to wear for a costume part or for cosplay.</li>
            <li> I read a lot of bad reviews beforehand, and now that I&#x27;ve received this wig, I realize many of the negative reviews are from people who bought cheap knockoffs from unauthorized sellers! Be sure to only purchase from MelodySusieDirect. They are the only authorized sellers of Melody Susie wigs (which are of fantastic quality for the price!) on Amazon. The wig I bought looks just like my natural hair, and looked great and natural even after trimming and gently combing (be sure to start combing from the bottom of the wig and work your way up towards the roots to avoid excess tangles.)</li>
            <li> I love this wig! It&#x27;s far from perfect; it&#x27;s way too long for example. I had to cut a lot of the hair to look normal, the front is hard to style and figure out how to hide the lining, and it gets very tangled. However, the hair looks pretty natural and is great for low pony tails and hairdos. I also like that it&#x27;s not too heavy and for the price it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> I originally bought this for myself, but ended up giving it to my sister because it made her feel like Miss America.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this wig. I recieved it very quickly, maybe 3 days after I ordered it. The quality is very good.</li>
            <li> I wear this to work every day because I can&#x27;t walk around here with my pink hair (it&#x27;s too &amp;#34;extreme&amp;#34;). Great, perfect wig for the perfect price. Totes recommend! 😀</li>
            <li> The color is pretty bad, and looks fake. Also, the bangs are too long, so I tried to trim them but it makes your forehead look weird!</li>
            <li> I was very surprised how real this looks!! Very happy.</li>
            <li> While the actual hair feels real enough, the fit is akward and makes my head look and feel way bigger than it actually is.  Not impressed</li>
            <li> I bought this wig for a festival. It looks great and I adore it! I&#x27;m definitely buying more wigs from this vendor!</li>
            <li> I originally had reviewed this product months ago and gave it a great review. I am now updating it so whoever is planning on buying this knows what they&#x27;re getting. First off, I use this wig for daily use and I take extremely good care of my wigs. I lost my hair to a medical condition and I rely on them to be my &amp;#34;real hair&amp;#34;. I love the price and the fact that the wigs come with a comb. I have tested if they will accept heat treating and at 300°, they hold up fine. However, over the long time I&#x27;ve been a customer, the quality has gone down. They do not stay together well anymore, you can see the netting no matter what, they shed like crazy, and the straps in the back stretch fast. Overall, it&#x27;s still nice. But they only last for two months at most.</li>
            <li> No fault of the seller. I think I should have gone with something mid-shoulder length. Plus my husband was not a fan. Shipping was fast and returning, I was a little concerned with, but they were so good about taking it back and money was refunded super fast. Thank you. I would still recommend this seller. Nothing wrong with the wigs. Just bad choosing on my part.</li>
            <li> The quality of this wig is amazing, it looks good, and feels like real hair also</li>
            <li> My friends were so jealous of this wig and could not believe me when I told them how little I had paid for it! I had to buy an extra just in case they bought them all out!</li>
            <li> I received the wig in 4 days which was pretty quick.  I was very impressed with the quality of the hair considering the price.  The only negative was in the crown area was a crimp in the hair where it is attached to the lace cap.  This is only the 2nd wig I have bought and  now that I wear wigs all the time, I would definitely buy from MelodySusie again.</li>
            <li> This looks natural,beautiful curls,and very long so you can cut if you want shorter.Surprised how nice this is at such a good price!I have paid over 100 dollars before and it wasnt near as nice as this.Talk about a good find at such an affordable price!LOVE,LOVE,LOVE!</li>
            <li> The wig feels so real and it&#x27;s stunning. I absolutely love it! I&#x27;m so glad that i got it, I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments.</li>
            <li> Love this wig!!!  It was a little to light but my sis order on that was to dark so we are trading! Very nice wig for the price!!</li>
            <li> Like this wig so much it doesn&#x27;t feel wiggy like some synthetic wigs. I definitely recommend this wig and the price is great!!!</li>
            <li> Looks nothing like it.</li>
            <li> First wig ever bought. Bought for fun. It looks real and fits good. The bangs were kind of tricky to fix. Looks great with a hat.  Overall good product. Would buy another.</li>
            <li> This is a awesome wig it&#x27;s comfortable and fun. I told my kids I got extentions and they believed me.</li>
            <li> It was somewhat small but I still rock it thanks</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised when I received this wig.  It looks great for the price. Not to cheap looking or shiny.</li>
            <li> Nice product although wish it was fuller. Will do OK for costume</li>
            <li> This is a great product, the feel of the hair is soft and natural. It was a very great buy.</li>
            <li> Great wig! Looks real, no fake shiny look, but the clips broke the second i snapped them together. The wig is tight enough that it does not really need them and if I have to it looks like an easy fix. The curls are pretty, but they do get a bit tangled; its great that it comes with a comb! Overall I really like it and it matches the color shown. I may need to trim the wig and bangs as they are a bit long for everyday use.</li>
            <li> Fits perfect. Looks like real human hair.</li>
            <li> This is the first wig I have ever bought and I was hesitant because of the price. I wondered if I was going to get what I paid for. The wig is very elegant. The only thing is, and the very bottom of the hair, it gets fuzzy and tangled really easy.  Honestly,  I am a stylist and have no problem giving it a trim, but for the price you pay this wig is a good deal.</li>
            <li> I should hv known better. This is absolutely horrible. Don&#x27;t even bother buying. The wig was poorly made and has an awful color. Trashed it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a lot lighter than most wigs with this kind of length. I found it very comfortable and easy to wear.</li>
            <li> I was really excited about getting a wig with long hair. So when I got this one and put it on looked so fake. My husband and kids laughed at me&lt;br /&gt;And told me not to wear in public. It doesn&#x27;t look so fake if you put hat on over it.</li>
            <li> Great product, price and packaging!! Would recommend to anyone</li>
            <li> I have very short hair because I love having short hair. That being said, I also love long hair, and I&#x27;ve had my pixie-cut for a very long time. I ordered this wig thinking that the price was just right, and I could get a feel for if I wanted to try growing my hair out again (plus I would have something for Halloween). Needless to say, I was very surprised! It got shipped to my house sooner than the estimated arrival time, it fits perfectly, and looks/feels incredibly real. With mine, it did not have the fake shine to it that most wigs have, and it has been able to keep it&#x27;s curls/waves. The color was also just the right shade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, my wig doesn&#x27;t look like the one pictured (the one that is pictured now is a new version). The hair isn&#x27;t quite as long or curly, and the bangs are much longer. I wear this wig out in public, and love having it! There was some light shedding and tangles (nothing a comb can&#x27;t fix), but my only MAJOR critique is about the bangs. The bangs are the most frustrating thing to work with. It&#x27;s hard to tell which side they go on, and to get them to stay properly - any wrong styling and the bangs begin to look very poor and get in the way. However, once they&#x27;re fixed in place, it truly is a wonderful wig, and I am so happy I bought it at the price I did! If I ever decide to buy a wig again, I will definitely be checking out this company again.</li>
            <li> tangles easily and is VERY hot to wear. i cant stand this on my head for more than an hour, which is kinda pointelss. but on the bright side - you can&#x27;t see the inseam of the wig so it&#x27;s pretty nice especially for the money.</li>
            <li> This is one of the most natural looking wigs available, and at such a great price. I trimmed it as needed, and just love this one. Got so many compliments on it, too.</li>
            <li> BEAUTIFUL!  Not even close to plastic looking, not much of a shine, large curls, avg fit nicely, waist length, and thick!  Didnt even need it styled!  Definite re order!</li>
            <li> Good quality for a cheap price.  Color is really nice and it isn&#x27;t scratchy like some other inexpensive synthetic wigs.</li>
            <li> Love wearing this wig. It looks and feel like real hair. It&#x27;s a good quality wig for a cheaper price!</li>
            <li> The bangs were deatroyed</li>
            <li> Really love this wig I wish I knew how to put up a pic ...this wig is so beautiful it&#x27;s darker in the pic but lighter in person ...it&#x27;s very soft...comes with a little comb and I cut it a little to fit the frame if my face</li>
            <li> Decent for the price. I put a hat over it after I put it on and it looked great. It is extremely long, I trimmed it a bit. It does shed a bit and a little hard to manage due to its legnth. Great for price. Won&#x27;t regret.</li>
            <li> This was my very first wig. It&#x27;s what started the craze! It&#x27;s very long and looks natural. I received many compliments.</li>
            <li> It is very fake looking..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The good part is, if you have a large head, this wig is absolutely sizeable to fit you! It did come in a nice box, with a wig comb and a cheap fishnet cap. It does say 1 year money back guarantee, so I will be returning it.</li>
            <li> I washed the hair with some organic shampoo and i left it out to sit overnight so it could dry. and the wig hairs started to fall out. i don&#x27;t know what happened and why the organic shampoo caused it to do that. i have no clue what i am going to do. Its, Monday, and i have work on Thursday and i cant go to work with no hair. Id rather go buy some other wig. And the crazy part is. &amp;#34;MelodySusie&amp;#34; Wont even give me a refund or resend me a new wig. This is nothing but a broke...cheap ass company.</li>
            <li> I loved this wig. I took it straight out the bag and put it on. It&#x27;s wonderful. It&#x27;s long, curly, and multi functional. I wouldn&#x27;t wear this to a club or anything but if im going to the mall,  work, or just a lunch date this is the wig I would go for.</li>
            <li> The wig arrived within 3 days after purchase date. Fast shipping. Easy to open package.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the wig, it is absolutely stunning. Looks and feels real. Everybody at work were stunned and impressed how nice and soft it is. I didn&#x27;t wear a wig cap since I currently have a pixie style cut. I wore it for 10 hours straight and I didn&#x27;t itch nor feel hot under it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this wig. Oh I almost forgot, it is really long. I&#x27;m 5&#x27;4\\&quot; in height and the hair falls right on top of my bum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE (Mar 5 2013).......&lt;br /&gt;I have uploaded a pic of the wig. Check out \\&quot;other customers pics\\&quot; in the product image. I think i have 3 pics. Hope it helps to some of you folks.</li>
            <li> I jus got this wig ND this was first one ever..MI hair is really thin due to health issues. .but after playing with it I think it looked great. .I love love love this item. .I so will get another very soon. .</li>
            <li> This wig looks nothing like the picture it&#x27;s not soft at all I really regret buying this horrible wig not satisfied at all</li>
            <li> Fast shipping just as described thanks!</li>
            <li> I love this wig. It was my first one. I am half black and was cursed with dry hair that was impossible to manage but I also couldn&#x27;t spend an hour and a half a day straighting it just to wash it again in a week. So I decided to give a wig a shot. I give it 4 stars instead of five because it tangles horribly and when you use the comb the curly disappear. Other than that I was pleased.</li>
            <li> Sorry but it looks fake</li>
            <li> Wow this Wig was so realistic and long and beautiful and flowy for just $20 !! I got so many compliments, If your looking for a great wig BUY THIS ONE! YOU will not regret</li>
            <li> i think that it gets tangled way too easy...other then that i would say that it is a nice wig for the price!</li>
            <li> My daughter looks like a mini Kim k. In this wig. It doesn&#x27;t look good on me though.</li>
            <li> I really love this wig, but for some reason, i cannot get it to stay on, and it may be my head shape or something but it wont stay on longer than an hour.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical because this wig was so cheap. But I love it! It&#x27;s really long so I had to trim it a bit. It comes with a wig cap and comb. The cap is so comfortable. It would be awesome if it had clips to make it more secure but I use bobby pins and it&#x27;s fine. I am very impressed. It looks natural and even though it&#x27;s synthetic it feels great. Will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> you get what u pay for , its pretty cute but it looks very wig like &amp; tangles &amp; losses curlys fast</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice and long - has a pretty in-style look too.  Price can&#x27;t be beat.  It&#x27;s not for me but for a young girl..  Hopefully I&#x27;ll get good reviews from her!</li>
            <li> So I recieved this today and it beyond exceeded my expectations. I am in love with it and it looks amazing :)</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Great packaging. Came in it&#x27;s own box in a ziplock back in a hair net&lt;br /&gt;Silky texture, unlike other synethic wigs that can often feel wiry.&lt;br /&gt;wig cap is black and isn&#x27;t visible around the wig&lt;br /&gt;Extra long so if you want to cut it to style it to your taste you have the option to do so (i&#x27;m 5&#x27;1 and it falls to my lower back&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Hair texture is a little thinner than I expected. Not as volumous as the photo shows</li>
            <li> nice look but it felt a bit on the heavy side.. but for theprice .. its good</li>
            <li> I love the wig! I have a short a-line cut and i just couldn&#x27;t wait any longer to have long hair. I wore my wig almost daily for awhile without brushing it after every use so now I can&#x27;t get the comb through it. It looks so ruined but I am going to order some authentic wig detangle r and hope I see some results! Other than my laziness to comb it after every use, it&#x27;s awesome! I just wish they had this in a blonde or light brown, too!!</li>
            <li> The wig wasn&#x27;t that full. the clips in the back are supposed to make the wig fit snug on your head but no matter how loose it keeps sliding off the back exposing the real hair line. wore it one time in the car and after i got out it had gotten all ratty and knotted up. Youre better off buying real hair wefts and making your own wig.</li>
            <li> She has no hair and we got her a locks of love wig and it was to tight and made her head hot this one is great no hot head she can&#x27;t stop looking ing the mirrors I am definitely going to get her more</li>
            <li> LOVE this wig! I get so many compliments when I wear it. If my friends didn&#x27;t already know that I have a bleach blonde pixie cut they would think it was real! Great quality for the price you pay!</li>
            <li> really nice for what you&#x27;re getting and what you&#x27;re paying, I&#x27;m using this as a cosplay wig 4 Beauty and the Beast and it&#x27;s very easy to work with</li>
            <li> I just got it this morning and I absolutely love it! It looks like real hair, my boyfriend and his sisters both agreed. We all think it looks beautiful, natural and realistic. It isn&#x27;t as curly as I thought it would be, but I think it still looks amazing since I mostly ordered it for the volume and length not necessarily for the curls. The shipping was fast for it being on the other side of the world and all, so no complaints on the wait here. The part was kinda eh, so I moved a little more hair to the bangs and it looks way better. If you want a natural, real looking wig, I&#x27;d definitely recommend this one.</li>
            <li> It was everything the reviews said it was and more. Except the bangs are a little long. I trimmed those. Outside of that? You would never know the difference in price between a high end wig? And this. I&#x27;ll buy more!!</li>
            <li> I am extremely pleased with this wig, it looks so gorgeous and natural. It&#x27;s a little darker than I wanted, but i should have expected that. The bangs do not need to be cut, they are the perfect length and look so cute. The whole wig is very long in the back it goes to my lower back. The curls are lovely, and it is very thick.</li>
            <li> This wig was so long it had to be cut. I just finished cutting it chin length. The hair is silky; the color is very dark with a reddish tint. Looks pretty much as pictured. Way too much hair but after cutting into a bob, it&#x27;s pretty nice. I&#x27;m a blond so the color aged me quite a bit but I wanted a dark wig for fun. And the price was right.</li>
            <li> It was great of quality. It provided more then what I asked, including a wig cap and comb. Thanks a lot!</li>
            <li> Bangs are wierd, does not stay on head correctly and hard to fasten in the back. Not going to give up though</li>
            <li> I suffer from trichotillomania (where you pull out your hair and eyelashes)  So I have bought a lot of wigs in my lifetime.&lt;br /&gt;I came across this wig at such an excellent price and figured I would try it.&lt;br /&gt;I have loved it.&lt;br /&gt;It has been just as good or better than the 200-300 dollar wigs I have been custom fit with.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s so much fun and I can do so many things with it.&lt;br /&gt;If you get the right products to work with it.  It lasts just as long as well--and at an amazing price.&lt;br /&gt;I am no longer ashamed, and afraid that people can tell that my hair is not my own, and I even feel sexy.I would recommend this to anyone who just wants long hair for fun, or for every day use for people like me with medical problems.</li>
            <li> Melody was a nice wig the style was really nice, but the only thing is that it shed a lot and it matte up quickly. .So I had to cut often to take the matting off..</li>
            <li> ditto for this wig as the short one I purchased so managable doesnt get tangly and dreaded easy to pick out gently I usually wash it in baby shampoo and conditioner in ice water for about three days for all my wigs really and this one just I dont even have to pick it half the time..I know the price is unreal but the wig is more sereal than anything...&lt;br /&gt;dawn</li>
            <li> Very satisfied :-) looks and feels very nice. Brand new. Only qualm, hair falls out easily when brushed but this is my first wig, maybe that&#x27;s normal?</li>
            <li> As a hair stylist I was afraid of the quality with the price being so low but I love it so worth the money</li>
            <li> so natural!! everyone thinks its my hair!!!greqt price..and super comfortable.  it tangles kinda easy though, only complaint, otherwise very nice wig</li>
            <li> Product arrived quickly and packaged very neatly. The wig was just as described. Needs a bit of styling since it was inside a box for a period of time. It did come with the wig comb and the wig cap unlike I had been reading in some of the other reviews prior to purchase. I didn&#x27;t want to take it off after I tried it on it felt very well made for the price and was money well spent.</li>
            <li> I bought this for a halloween costume and it was actually really nice, perfectly matched my actual hair and felt less cheap than typical wigs.</li>
            <li> Purchased to wear as part of a Halloween costume and people actually thought it was my real hair! Great price to get for a costume and high enough quality to wear out for fun.</li>
            <li> I am so upset. The hair seems like nice quality but the bangs look like someone just chopped away at them. Not swoopy at all. And the color isnt even close. Id love to return but I received as a gift. I should post pics of how bad the bang job is.</li>
            <li> Really pretty fits well tangles a lil easy though</li>
            <li> I bough this for a family member going through cancer. It&#x27;s her daily wear piece, she said it&#x27;s comfortable and  is worth the price. We did have the bangs trimmed by a hairstylist to frame the face because it&#x27;s a little odd looking out of the package.</li>
            <li> sold it to a friend&lt;br /&gt;wasnt for me</li>
            <li> The more I wear this the more I love it. It is really long and flows nicely.</li>
            <li> The wig is a lot longer than it appears in the picture and not as full. It looks nice, but the length makes it so that it just looks unnatural. It is a good wig for being silly at home, but I would not feel comfortable wearing it out in public.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a wig, and it looks like a wig. this picture is very flattering, and perhaps i would benefit from learning to style wigs.. it looks great under a hat or a doo-rag. it&#x27;s difficult to part the hair because you&#x27;ll see the netting of the wig.. but it works for my purpose, and i&#x27;m really glad i bought it:)</li>
            <li> Looks real, but I had ti trim the bangs a bit. It tanges as any long hair does, so I got some  stuff to help stop it. Also because its so full and real looking it gets HOT very fast. Still, until I grow my hair back out it works when Im washing y shorter one.</li>
            <li> I was looking at wigs with high-ratings, and kept skipping this one over because it was so inexpensive. I finally came back and read the reviews on it, and I figured for $18, it wasn&#x27;t too much of a risk to check it out. Well, got it in the mail yesterday and I have to say it really is all everyone is saying. While I doubt you&#x27;d fool anyone into thinking it is your real hair, it is a very high-quality costume wig. However, I think if someone was 40 feet away from me - or if you have a hat on top of it - they wouldn&#x27;t be able to tell that it is a wig. I definitely recommend purchasing this if it&#x27;s for a costume. The hair is really long and sits nicely. It doesn&#x27;t seem to tangle easily, though it does come with a small comb. Also to note that it includes a fish-net cap to hold your own hair into the wig. The cap itself is also high-quality and keeps your hair firmly against your head.</li>
            <li> I ordered dark brown and it came is light golden/caramel drown. Very unhappy!!!</li>
            <li> Not as expected and was not sure is I could return it.</li>
            <li> Very voluptuous but cute for the price :)</li>
            <li> Product is much to long and is far more curly then picture, and the lack of combs makes it very hard to keep on. The hair itself was nice hoowever this wig looks nothing like the picture</li>
            <li> So many compliments on this wig everyone thought it was my real hair.</li>
            <li> i bought this for my wife and she loves it.. she said it looks real and feels real just like her own hair.</li>
            <li> This is a fairly high quality costume wig.  I have been using it for months and it still looks in good shape.  It itches a little bit, but still is much better than other wigs I have tried</li>
            <li> This wig is absolutely outstanding, putting it on was comfortable, it fit my head perfectly, and the length of the wig made the backside of my body looked quite pretty with the flow of the wig.  However, I have been purchasing wigs for a very long time, and this one seems to dry and get tangled within the 3rd week of wearing this wig every day.  For it&#x27;s price I can understand.  I highly recommend for those ladies who simply want to wear for a one night out with their friends...this wig will definitely make you look good.  This wig also is for small head shapes and that they provide an awesome comb and wig cap.  I am impressed with this wig.</li>
            <li> The look, feel and fit is great. Now it&#x27;s up to my hubby of 22 years to name this girlfriend.</li>
            <li> I am going to be using the wig for drag and I love it. The hairnet works well! I don&#x27;t like the comb though... The comb can&#x27;t take out knots and even causes some. I would recommend this to a friend if they purchased another brush.</li>
            <li> Really worth the money! Super cheap. I go to beauty school and every time I wear this wig I always get so many complements! People say they can&#x27;t even tell its fake! It&#x27;s really  long I&#x27;m 5&#x27;3&amp;#34; and it goes to the bottom of my back! But I absolutely love this wig!</li>
            <li> its not as full as in the picture or as I expected it to be but we get what we pay for.  its a nice wig for Halloween</li>
            <li> Purchased to dress up someone in the family for Halloween, we have found this to be of good quality for the small price we paid.</li>
            <li> I bought this wig because I wanted to wear something that I could hide my un-natural hair color with to make it easier to find a job. It was really really shiny and didn&#x27;t really look real to me. The curls were also very untamed. It&#x27;s an okay wig I guess. Still looking though.</li>
            <li> This wig is great quality for the price. I got it for a Halloween costume and while at the party everyone could not believe it wasnt my hair.The packaging was great and came with everything I needed. I would buy from this maker again.</li>
            <li> This is a great wig. Wore for a Halloween costume as &amp;#34;Kim Kardashian.&amp;#34; It is very real looking. Many people thought I actually dyed my own hair. The wig comes with a wig cap, comb, and is in a box. Even brushed the waves and curls still kept their form. I would purchase from this company again if I ever need another wig. The wig was not as expensive as wigs in the Halloween and is much better quality.</li>
            <li> Was very iffy at first, because of the price. It does shed a bit if you&#x27;re rough with it but all in all very real looking. I absolutely love it and wear it it to death! I want one in every color!!</li>
            <li> Very  sexy and full wig.  I can&#x27;t wait to use if for Halloween.  The color is a nice chocolate brown and you can style and cut it if you need to.  Great price for this quality.</li>
            <li> Who ever wants to buy this, do it. You wont regret. Wig is beautiful .</li>
            <li> Such a good unit for the price. One of my favorites</li>
            <li> First time wig users will love the natural feel and easiness of this out-on-the-night wig. It is very long (longer then normal natural hair) so be aware that I am 5,7 and it almost went to my butt. But if that is what your looking for then I recommend you buy it now. :)</li>
            <li> Good wig for the price but I really wish the bangs were longer also it get tangled easily and honestly it&#x27;s longer than I thought but over all it&#x27;s pretty nice</li>
            <li> Sexy, stylish and great quality!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a big skeptic for buying wigs online especially because of the color (it might not look the same as online). This wig was high quality looks good and is breathable! I can&#x27;t believe I lucked out! I spent over an hour on amazon looking for a decent wig to go on a night out with my man and I found one ill be using for a long time! It even came with a wig comb and saved me the trouble of getting a cap. It fits good I didn&#x27;t have to adjust it. It looks and feels so natural. My husbad loves and and asked when I can buy more of them. I&#x27;m glad they included the comb I never would have bought one this good. It&#x27;s so easy to style and I love that it came so lond. I trimmed  about two inches off to flatter my face. Love it!</li>
            <li> Shipped fast, fits perfect and its adjustable and it feels real!</li>
            <li> I just received this yesterday, a day early. This was my first wig &amp; I didn&#x27;t know what to expect. Hair extensions &amp; dye ruined my natural hair. Figured a wig would be a good break for my hair to get strong, plus this is the style I had with extensions. It&#x27;s so realistic that it looks the same as before, but healthy! This product is lightweight, not itchy, looks natural, and is adjustable to fit!&lt;br /&gt;My ONLY concern is that it will wear out fast. Only wore for a few hours so far &amp; have a detached track in it. Other then that, I can&#x27;t complain because it&#x27;s so nice &amp; affordable! Way better then expected.</li>
            <li> This thing stinks and is not a dark brown its a light brown.  It is produced in China and I just wonder if they are adhering to American production standards, it shouldn&#x27;t smell like funky chemicals.  Also, it doesn&#x27;t look like this picture, it&#x27;s really thick from above the shoulders  but gets really think after that, like long Cindy Brady pigtails.  Luckily I ordered it through Amazon and I am going to send it back.  It could be ok for a costume but seriously, the smell just makes you wonder how it was made.</li>
            <li> Just as good as I was hoping for! Looks so real, even my mom who isnt a fan of wigs and such said it looked gorgeous and realistic, and for only like 17$, very happy with my purchase :3</li>
            <li> Loved this wig. It comes pristine with a wonderful cap and comb which imo is a great deal. The comb DID have one bent tooth but I&#x27;m fins with that, it still works perfectly for me. The curls on this do seem to get exaggerated a bit with wear. I do mean curls, the picture shows more gentle waves but large ringlets etc. show up.</li>
            <li> so i recently cut 15 inches off of my hair into a very short bob and decided it would the perfect time to play with wigs.  After reading different reviews I settled on this wig due to price and having good reviews.  I absolutely love this wig, its a nice long length and looks real.  Also included was a wig cap and wire comb.  I would recomend this wig :)</li>
            <li> I love this wig! I have bought plenty of wigs and this one is by far the best! If you take good care of it, it will last a long time!</li>
            <li> I love the wig it is what I excepted long and soft... Great buy I can where this anywhere face and easy to maintain</li>
            <li> This wig is amazing, it looks real when you put it on. I would recommend this wig to anyone who wants long wavy hair.  The length does not get in the way and the curls look very natural and full. The only thing I am not used to is the bangs, but they are very pretty.  Once you put the wig, it is easy to swipe the bangs to the side or pin them up to the side which is what I did.</li>
            <li> Valentine&#x27;s Day Best Offer - MelodySusie New Women&#x27;s Long Full Curly is nice wig, good looking and not expensive. Recommend it.</li>
            <li> I got this wig for a Halloween costume and it was perfect! Great price. Love the long side bang. It&#x27;s very long. Nice packaging - thankful to have the comb, cap, and care instructions in a nice box to keep it all together.</li>
            <li> I love this wig. It seems very real. I wore it to work and everyone loved it. I wish they made a strawberry blond one!</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS WIG. I feel so girly and beautiful when I wear it. Very realistic, I was thrilled when someone thought it was my real hair</li>
            <li> Poorly made wig. Don&#x27;t waste your money. Buy something better. I could not use it even once.....</li>
            <li> If it&#x27;s cut it to realistic length and the bangs are shaped up. It could pass for real. It&#x27;s a pretty rich medium brown. Unfortunately I&#x27;m more of a dark blonde.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;YouTube has some great tutorials on how to shape up a wig.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this wig! The packaging for it is very cute as well. I got this wig as a lolita cosplay wig and it works very nicely. It rarely tangles and it is very soft like real hair. I love the comb it came with and I love how it came with a wig cap also. I will say the curls make it a little hard to comb out at the ends, but for the most part it&#x27;s the best wig I&#x27;ve ever own! And it will defiantly last a long time, make sure you take good care of it! :)</li>
            <li> My wig came in the mail a few days ago and I absolutely love it! It fits great and the hair is soft and natural looking. I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Wig came in fast, ordered April 12th, came on April 15th.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The wigs looks real, I like the color it&#x27;s brown with a little hint of red. It looks natural. I like the curls, the bangs, and how long it is! I recommend this to people who wants this wig.</li>
            <li> This was actually really cool, good quality, the only complaint is that is was way longer than I thought and it wasn&#x27;t as full as I thought it would be. But it&#x27;s great</li>
            <li> I ordered this wig with the intention of getting one use out of it. However, it was it much better condition than I expected. I have already worn it once and it is still is GREAT condition! I will say that it was a bit longer than I anticipated and it is a one-length hairstyle so I will be trimming the ends and adding a few slight layers before wearing it again but that is not a complaint for me.</li>
            <li> Very nice! It&#x27;s thin and tangles easily, though. When it came out of the package, I didn&#x27;t care for how it was styled. So I completely re-styled and cut it (: it looks very realistic and nice! I had ordered 2 day shipping, although it didn&#x27;t come on time. That&#x27;s alright, merely a day late. (:</li>
            <li> I got this wig with two other wigs off Amazon. I this one is the softest wig out of all of them! It actually feels like real hair to me.You can even brush the top where the bang area is to get the bangs how you want them. I have had no issues with tangles so far. The inside of the wig is much more comfortable than the other two I bought as well. I am very happy with my purchase!</li>
            <li> I am EXTREMELY impressed with this wig and I&#x27;m a cosmetologist. This is a safe, good purchase! When you receive the wig wash it to fluff it up a bit, comb it out and let it dry. Spray a little dry shampoo on it then put it on and style it. So easy and the quality and realness is amazing. So happy with this purchase! I can&#x27;t figure out how to add pictures but my IG name is radmamabear if you want to see what it looks like! I can&#x27;t get over how excited I am to find a cheap wig that&#x27;s fantastic quality</li>
            <li> It looks nothing like the picture it&#x27;s terrible it was already frizzy when I received it I&#x27;m not happy...!!!!</li>
            <li> Very pleased and a great price!</li>
            <li> You could tell from a diatance it&#x27;s was fake, once you start brushing it gets ruined, &amp; it tangled way too fast an easily. Absolutely haited it.</li>
            <li> Thrilled with this purchase.  Wasn&#x27;t expecting such a nice wig for the price.  Would purchase again.  Very pleased.  Hubby loves it too.</li>
            <li> it is WAY darker in real life than in this picture. in real life it looks almost black and with a hint of red in it.  when i put it on, it looked REALLY fake because of how dark it was. i have light-dark brown eye brows its like the color of the wig in the photo but in real life it is WAY darker.. i dont recommend this wig unless you are going to a costume party or have dark eyebrows.</li>
            <li> The wig is amazing, really soft, very long and the curls are perfect. However the bangs are way longer than shown in the pictuer so I had to trim them a bit, but other than that the cap fits perfectly and the wig is straigtenable. I was very hesitant on even trying to put my strightener to it because of the price I paid for this wig. I thought it would ruin it, it didn&#x27;t. I will deffinately buy more.</li>
            <li> This is the first wig I&#x27;ve bought, so I was really nervous. It is gorgeous! It took a bit of brushing to get the curls right, and it shed a bit initially, but I think any wig would, and it doesn&#x27;t shed so much anymore. The natural part of the hair is on a skin-colored piece rather than the mesh-looking lace, so even that looks pretty natural. It seems to get knotted a bit easy, but with long curls it is to be expected. My friends gave it a 3 out of 10, with 1 being the most realistic, in looks. The volume can make it look a bit big, so a headband or one of those hipster beanies would make it look even better. For under $20 I am impressed and excited to buy more.</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying, as someone that suffers from Trichotillomania and has to wear a wig daily, high quality is of the utmost importance to me. I&#x27;ve worn many different wigs of many different qualities throughout the years. I&#x27;ve worn both real and synthetic and paid close to $1000 dollars for a wig. Like most people, I assumed that high price equals high quality. I learned, after spending thousands of dollars, that my previous statement is not the case. This sentiment rings especially true after receiving this wig.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was hesitant to purchase a wig online because I&#x27;m really picky and what a wig looks like on a stand isn&#x27;t always what it looks like on your head. Because this wig is so reasonably priced (and I can return it to Amazon if I don&#x27;t like it) I decided to give it a shot. I&#x27;m so glad that I did! For the price I was expecting the wig to be of poor costume-y type quality...Wrong! I was pleasantly surprised. The hair is extremely soft and the cap is really comfortable. The hair doesn&#x27;t have that superficial wig shine like a lot of other synthetics. And the curls are absolutely gorgeous. I love the color and the fit but the length is a bit longer than I expected. I&#x27;m 5&#x27;5\\&quot; and it reaches my belly button. I&#x27;m going to have it trimmed a bit but if length is what you seek, this wig is perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**I also want to note: One of the reviews stated that they took their straightener to the wig *gasp!* Do not take heat to a synthetic wig! I&#x27;m glad the reviewer didn&#x27;t have any negative effects but typically heat melts synthetic hair. Even heat from opening the oven can melt the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Back to my review: If you&#x27;re looking for an affordable and realistic looking wig I definitely recommend this one!</li>
            <li> Dark brown doesn&#x27;t look right on me so I&#x27;ll go for black</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m shocked how real this wig looks. Love the length &amp; curl.</li>
            <li> I love it so much I bought it two times. That&#x27;s right.  The 1st one I cut off about 4 inches.  But I love it so much that I bought it again so I could have it long too. Every time I wear it I am complimented. It is so much like real hair . It&#x27;s not too shiny. You can brush it, wash it and  pat it dry. Best ever.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this wig! It does get super tangled easy but I&#x27;ve purchased 3 of them already and love them! Great buy!</li>
            <li> they hair was long and beautiful but It didn&#x27;t look natural on me.</li>
            <li> This wig was super great, it is really long so I cut a couple inches off but it looks real a lot of people were asking me if I got extensions.&lt;br /&gt;if you have a large head, you may have to clip it on. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who wants a cheap but nice wig!</li>
            <li> I got this just for fun to see if I (natural strawberry blonde) would look good if I went brunette. I tried it out in public and they thought I&#x27;d cut heavier bangs and colored my own hair. It is as thick as natural hair, styled beautifully, the bangs easily can be flipped toward wither side and the bang section comes straight forward in design. I like a less dramatic side part, so simply sectioned some over to the other side and it framed my face beautifully. It also came with a wig comb, care instructions and a wig hair net. Wig also has an elastic closure at nape of neck against scalp that you can slip the little hook to customize tightness of fit if desired.  If i ever buy another fun wig I will look here first! exceptional quality for the price.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kind of hard for me to review this product. When I received this wig was inlove with it. It was soft and full. It was soft and beautiful. Then I read.&lt;br /&gt;someone soaked theirs In liquid&lt;br /&gt;Fabric softenerso I tried that and it ruined my wig. Hair fell out all over except where the front lace is. Ontology of that adv&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ic e that</li>
            <li> Thick and VERY good quality for synthetic hair.</li>
            <li> one word &amp;#34;terrible&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too long and too big to wear everyday &amp; tangles easily but will be a good costume addition. If it wasn&#x27;t so big it does look real. not too shiny not too dull nice color.</li>
            <li> Amazing, worth every penny. Looks and feels so real.</li>
            <li> Amazing wig the curls are very nice and the texture is great! the color is darker than in the picture and the wig is very long (I&#x27;m 5&#x27;2 and it comes to my butt) it&#x27;s a little thin at the ends but overall I love it</li>
            <li> I love the high quality this wig gives you for such a good price!</li>
            <li> on of the best synthetic wigs that i have bought!</li>
            <li> Cute but brown was not my color and also it felt plastic like which I don&#x27;t like also it just looked fake</li>
            <li> The wig is indeed really pretty, but for starters, it does indeed tangle easily, so handle with care! On another note, I was very upset at the fact that it does not seem to fit my head properly, and It wont allow me to return it, so I&#x27;m basically stuck with a wig, that doesn&#x27;t fit. Hope no one else runs into this problem.</li>
            <li> This looks so real, it feels almost like human hair..Thick and Beautiful and just as described! Also so affordable, perfect for those of us who want hair or just to change the looks of what we have! Buy this wig you will love it as much as I do!</li>
            <li> This is the first wig that I&#x27;ve bought online and the first non-costume wig I have purchased.  I have a full head of thick curly hair and I didn&#x27;t want to die it or cut it, but I did want a temporary change.  (One day I will go gray or be old and I wanted to get an idea of my options).  It is very cute on even though I haven&#x27;t figured out how to wear it properly.  If you have a ton of hair, it will seem like there isn&#x27;t much on this, but I think that anyone who was actually losing their hair would LOVE this wig.  It is a very flirty, sexy style.</li>
            <li> Just got my wig and it&#x27;s great, especially for the price. Looks very natural. Only thing is its a bit thin in the back. Other than that I love it</li>
            <li> I just received this wig today and I&#x27;m pretty excited. There are a few issues with it, but overall I really love it. The hair isn&#x27;t a shiny or fake looking so this would make a good every day wig. I also like the ability to adjust the size on the inside. Plus, it&#x27;s a great natural color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the part in the front leaves a strange separation on the wig where you can kinda see the wig material (I&#x27;ll add a photo). I&#x27;ve already had a few pieces of the hair fall out, but I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s a big deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This wig is very long, and beautiful! Definitely worth buying!</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first,as soon as it came I tosses it on,trimmed off a bit and wore it 2 days and my husband didn&#x27;t know it wasn&#x27;t my hair! Lol its the same colir as my real hair just longer and with bangs.! Impressive! I&#x27;m getting another for fun;)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a decent wig. A little thin and the cap is a little too snug though. I wouldn&#x27;t have paid 17 bucks for it if I could have seen it first though. I&#x27;ve bought better wigs for half the price.</li>
            <li> If I could give this wig zero stars I would. I purchased this for a family member who lost their hair from chemotherapy. The wig was knotted when I removed it from the packaging. We brushed it out, but it gets knotted very easily. This wig turned out to be a disappointing purchases. I will do some research and invest in a wig that can be worn more then a couple of times before it has to be thrown away.</li>
            <li> I got the wig and it looks grate on me and fits very good on my head. I can&#x27;t wait to buy more.</li>
            <li> Awesome! Looks soooo real! I feel very comfortable in. LOVE LOVE LOVE it!!!!!</li>
            <li> I received this today on time! And I have to say I love it. Color was a little darker but the length for me was perfect! Awesome product and very natural looking. I have been told I have never looked better! Well worth the money!</li>
            <li> Was not happy with this wig at all. It&#x27;s poorly made doesn&#x27;t stay on properly. I would not recommend it.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have ever bought a wig, and so I was kind of iffy of it. I thought it might be a little on the thinner side as you would see at regular party stores, and another reason was because of the cheap price. I was really excited to open the box though when I received it today and nearly tore it apart and let me tell you I was not disappointed! It&#x27;s extremely soft, flexible and realistic looking!I waltzed into my living room to show my brother and he thought it was real at first! The color is a perfect shade red-brown that compliments my beige skin. One thing that I was disappointed with was that the hair falls out, not a lot though and the curls tangle easily. But what curls don&#x27;t?!&lt;br /&gt;All and all this was a very great buy and I will definitely be buying from them again!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s part of my halloween costume...It&#x27;s not cheap (like from a costume shoppe) at all.&lt;br /&gt;I may need to cut a  little off, but otherwise-Nice</li>
            <li> It looked just like it does in the picture. There were a few minor tangles but that was from packaging. It&#x27;s looks and feels natural. I&#x27;d recommend it to all my friends.</li>
            <li> Yes, this is synthetic so you can&#x27;t use the great products. But I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;re going to need them. When I purchased this wig I wrote it just about every, and everywhere I went people would complement it, our looks so real. I love long hair so this fit very well. Looks even greater if you add a little tease for volume. Don&#x27;t worry about done because it&#x27;s definitely not aproblem, if it is for you just simply powder it or use dry shampoo, just as effective for me.</li>
            <li> I have a slightly large head for a girl, and this doesn&#x27;t really fit.  The service was good, so the company is not to blame, but I warn girls with larger heads that this will not work for you.</li>
            <li> 2 stars for quick shipping but the hair tangles so ridiculously much.</li>
            <li> Great product and excellent customer service.</li>
            <li> Order this wig for a Halloween costume for my daughter. The color that arrived does not match what is shown in the picture for Cark Brown, it is a lighter brown than what was expected. It made due for the reason it was purchased but It is defientley not high quality or made for continuous wear. The wig comb that comes with it, is very flimsy and does not work with the wig.</li>
            <li> Just got it in the mail today and love it... not as full as the picture but still really good... i recently also bought a $40 wig and i think this ones better then the other. Definatly a good buy!</li>
            <li> Very pretty, looks just like the pic! The only reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5 is because it sheds a lot. Otherwise it&#x27;s great for the price and looks very real</li>
            <li> A little thin in the back but I still wore it during chemo</li>
            <li> I have always wanted long hair but I never find the patience.  My first two friends couldn&#x27;t even tell I was wearing it!  It&#x27;s the exact same Colorado as my natural hair colour.  I am very pleased.  Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Very Nice Wig. Comes in a great package and with a comb and net. I would suggest to put the wig on someone else&#x27;s head and light brush the wig starting at the ends. Do not brush hard and the wig looks great afterwards. Maybe some trimming might be needed in the future to spruce it up. Overall I am very happy with this wig and it looks so realistic on. Loving it.</li>
            <li> This is a great wig for the price! It&#x27;s full and excellent quality. Soft, silky, lengthy hair. The downsides are that the curls hold taught in a dolly-like manner and it does have the \\&quot;it&#x27;s a wig\\&quot; sheen to it. My secret is to use baby or body powder to dull the shine and I trimmed it&#x27;s length to soften the stubborn curls. It is a lovely wig for things like cosplay/modelling but out in the world, girls might call you out on it.</li>
            <li> Great value I ordered 3 wigs from 3 places. This was the best one. And only one I didn&#x27;t want to return.</li>
            <li> This wig is do fun and pretty!  Love it!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this wig it takes heat not to high frm cheap ceramic curlers  i used a flat iron just to run over it n i made foil rods n got my bouncy curls back i will b ordering 5 maybe 6 more just ordered a straight melody susie and i will say for the price and quality  is amazing love this company light shedding but if u can manage it totally worth the money brush alot or comb minimizes shedding</li>
            <li> Very cute on the first day then it got matted...unable to even attempt a comb out...never again buying from this seller...what was the point of a free comb if you can&#x27;t use it...?</li>
            <li> Cute &amp; comfortable wig but I thought it was a bit too long &amp; not very thick. Haven&#x27;t attempted trimming it yet but you can tell that it&#x27;s fake.</li>
            <li> This wig looks so natural! Looks much better on than in the stock photos, but was everything I wanted all together. Not too shiny, everyone thought they were extensions. This was also my very first wig so I was a little sceptical. They do tangle a bit, but if you take care of them, you will be seriously impressed!!</li>
            <li> You want to be incognito for some reason, here you go.  This wig was a great price for the quality.  I gave it as a gift and she loved it.  This might not be something you would want to wear every day, but for a special occasion, it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and I&#x27;m glad it did! It may not have all the bells and whistles, but it&#x27;s beautiful and pretty natural looking. For the price, I couldn&#x27;t have asked for more! I had my doubts, especially with a lot of reviews, but it&#x27;s quite covering and mostly easy to keep untangled if you follow the instructions and take care of it, even when storing. I&#x27;m SO glad I took this chance! It&#x27;s cute as heck!</li>
            <li> Having recently shaved my head for cancer support, I decided to go brunette (I am a natural redhead). The wig is pretty but you will need to wash and comb it regularly to avoid rats and tangles.</li>
            <li> So I bought this wig cause my hair is super short and some days I get super lazy. The bangs are way long. I had to cut them. I also had to cut about the last 4 inches off the back cause it got super tangled and looked like a birds nest. It does shed a little bit but nothing major. The netting is not noticeable. All my friends say it looks real. I wore it twice before both hooks on the straps broke. So I sewed the straps where I wanted them. I would give it 5 stars but because the hooks busted off I&#x27;m only going to give it 4.</li>
            <li> I like it no complaints</li>
            <li> Very happy with the product! It was my first time purchasing a wig so I was nervous about the quality and if it&#x27;d look too fake but it doesn&#x27;t at all! I&#x27;m in love with it :)</li>
            <li> Incredible quality! I can&#x27;t believe the price was so low for this great wig! Looks and feels like natural hair.  Cool and comfortable.</li>
            <li> I have bleached hair and generally I love being blonde no matter how damaging it is. Every once in awhile I am tempted to change my color but I never do because I know I will want to go back blonde eventually(which would cause more damage) So I thought why not try a wig? I pay lots of money for human hair extensions so I didn&#x27;t  really expect much from this synthetic hair...but I was really surprised. Only con was the color seemed a bit more dark than the picture, but that is ok. I wish they had more lighter colors. I think I want to get red next!</li>
            <li> Beautiful! I was super skeptical because of the bad reviews but it&#x27;s perfect. I&#x27;m a model and needed this for a bunch of shoots. I do have a small head, so you can&#x27;t have a big head for this. It&#x27;s gorgeous and looks real!</li>
            <li> I bought two wigs from here, and this one was my favorite! I got so many compliments when I was wearing it. They both look very natural. Now before I bought it I read all the reviews and saw that some people were complaining about things like frizz and shine. If your wig is too shiny for your liking you can take makeup powder similar to the hair color and run it through or just spray with hairspray. As for the frizz, it does get a tiny-bit frizzy throughout the day, especially if you wear it all day like I do. All you have to do is bring a brush with you and brush it out every once in a while. I don&#x27;t know why people complain about stuff like that, no wig is going to stay perfect, it&#x27;s just common sense. There are also Youtube videos about how to maintain your wigs and take care of them. I&#x27;d buy more from Melody Susie!</li>
            <li> I got my wig super fast and it was beautiful. It&#x27;s very soft and not too shiny, it doesn&#x27;t seem to tangle too easily either. It is comfortable to wear and I love the style, everyone just assumed I had gotten extensions when they saw it, they never considered it might be a wig. &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> It was better than wigs I&#x27;ve paid 90+ dollars for, I got it and was quite happy, I&#x27;ve never worn the wigs out of my house because they just looked fake. Granted the part is a little bit of a give away if you&#x27;re up super close, but nonetheless very realistic :) The bangs were on the opposite side of mine naturally so i had to get used to that lol.</li>
            <li> This is awsome. Very high quality, especially for the price. looks and feels very real, I get tons of compliments with this hair.</li>
            <li> I love this wig! So fun to wear and looks like real hair! Plus shipping was surprisingly fast considering it came from across the globe. My friends always get excited when they see me wearing this wig and they all want to wear it.</li>
            <li> I received my hair today 5/2013 2 weeks earlier then expected!!  Its down to my butt gets a little tangled  but not much. The only thing I didn&#x27;t like was it didn&#x27;t have any pins in it to make sure it doesn&#x27;t slip off my hair but overall satisfied.</li>
            <li> Shipping was quick. The wig is much better than I expected for the price. I am going through chemo &amp; like this wig better than the $300 one that I bought. It spent Memorial weekend on a boat with multiple people wearing it &amp; it still looks great! I ordered 3 more as backups :-)</li>
            <li> Well the roots are crappy,nappy,and look weird but the length is great and its really thin but remember its not real human hair so u can&#x27;t do anything with it ,😑 so u get wat u pay 4 🙍</li>
            <li> Very happy. Arrived quickly. Thanks!</li>
            <li> Very noticeable in front.  Pretty color.</li>
            <li> It tangles easily and the front edge doesn&#x27;t look natural on me. For the price it served my needs. Thanks.</li>
            <li> I saw a lot of people on here raving about this for daily use. Let me say this it would be great for a one time use like Halloween but not everyday. The hair was stringy at first so I took others advice and trimmed it up. It helped with the stringy part but the hair just would stay untangled. Even with little movement and a good combing through it would be tangled moments late. Basically I could do  a long braid and that was it. I took a couple cute picks but more than anything it left me wanting to buy a high quality wig.</li>
            <li> i placed the order October 6th item arrived October 11th was not tangled but tangles EASILY i love the little face it came with a wig comb AND a cap when opening i saw the items in the package and was very surprised and happy. the wig looks and feel real i get compliments on it ALL the time when i&#x27;m out and feel like wearing a wig(i&#x27;m strange). it arrived very quick to so yea. i was glad that i found this wig i LOOKED EXACTLY how my hair did when i was younger long and curly. if your looking for an everyday kind of wig get this one or Halloween its a great wig.</li>
            <li> what  a waste of money and time...please dont buy this wig if u value your money !! I regret every single minute geez.....total crap</li>
            <li> Loved the color, didn&#x27;t love the quality. Mine got so snarly and tangled at the ends and so dry after just one time of wearing it that I had to trim it right away.  I was in a play and had used it or I would have returned it.  It fit beautifully, and the color is gorgeous! I don&#x27;t know if I just got a bad one- because other reviews said they loved theirs.  I loved the color and fit enough, and for the price I think I would buy it again just to see if mine was just a fluke in getting so ratty and dry so quickly and give it another chance.</li>
            <li> Really like this wig,  looks real and you can pretty much part it wherever you&#x27;d like. Isn&#x27;t overly shiny like some wigs. Could be thicker but it&#x27;s thick enough to hide the cap so that&#x27;s good enough for me.</li>
            <li> The picture isn&#x27;t the same what you get.&lt;br /&gt;Was not happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;Looked like a Halloween wig&lt;br /&gt;Came with comb that would pull the hair out.&lt;br /&gt;Wasn&#x27;t worth the money not happy</li>
            <li> it got here quick enough and I loved it</li>
            <li> Love it!!!!!! The hair is thick and it looks very natural</li>
            <li> impressive, longest hair, for your dollar.</li>
            <li> Love it... people can&#x27;t tell it&#x27;s a wig the hair is not shiny like plastic hair it looks real</li>
            <li> I was really surprised with this wig, i wasnt expecting much, but i really love it, i had to cut it because it was very very long and it tangles terribly but im not worried about that, it brushes out without too much of a headache!</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t believe this wig was $16. it is great!!! it is super long....I had a great laugh when i originally got it/ the hair was up to my bum I think. I just cut it to a reasonable length. Everybody loves it.</li>
            <li> I am returning. Not high quality at all. Thin and very gaped (about 3/4 inch) between wefts in the back. Plus the wefts are very visible if if you try to pull up sides or bangs. Only get this if you plan to wear it exactly as it looks</li>
            <li> It looks great actually. I was at first very iffy on buying this product. I got it in the mail right away (I thought it was going to be late) and once I opened the box I was so excited. It&#x27;s however VERY long (I&#x27;m 5&#x27;1&#x27;&#x27;) so I just cut it to look like my normal hair. Also, I actually wear this almost everyday because everyone likes how it looks on me. I also don&#x27;t use the wig cap they give you--I put the wig on top of my normal hair so it looks like I have professionally dyed hair! I would definitely buy this item once again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Not too shiny&lt;br /&gt;looks real&lt;br /&gt;light feeling not heavy&lt;br /&gt;can wash it (I use just conditioner &amp; wash it every week since I wear it almost everyday)&lt;br /&gt;adjustable size&lt;br /&gt;full looking&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve actually fallen asleep with it on lol&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Can become itchy&lt;br /&gt;sheds a little&lt;br /&gt;have to style the top so no one can see the cap&lt;br /&gt;can&#x27;t handle heat (looks like you have split ends)&lt;br /&gt;becomes tangled but not like other wigs where it is unbearable&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, definitely worth the price!</li>
            <li> This is great for the price. Came with wig cap, comb and bookmark. Love the wig, good quality. My only complaint is there is no part in the wig.</li>
            <li> Great natural looking wig (unplastic looking). VERY VERY LONG unnatural length. Needs a good cut. I took 6-7 inches off and gave it full bangs.</li>
            <li> Went around shopping and my girlfriend had many compliments on how beautiful her hair was. We did need to take and have it trimmed and styled but even then the ladies at the salon said please don&#x27;t tell us you have come to cut off all your beautiful hair. Will be buying more wigs from this vendor.</li>
            <li> I just got my wig in the mail today and I was shocked about how real it looked an felt I&#x27;m so in love with it !!!</li>
            <li> This item was exactly how it was pictured! I love it! I had to trim it a little because it was a little uneven in the back but I Love it! and you can&#x27;t beat the price either!</li>
            <li> Great wig for costume or everyday use!!  The hair is soft and does not tangle or get frizzy. The picture does not show how long it is but is hits my lower back and I am 5&#x27;10&amp;#34;. It comes with a wig cap and a wig comb.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting so much from this wig! I can&#x27;t as much as wear it again after a month of buying it.It came nice and beautiful,even when I started trimming the hair,it kept tangling.This hair tangles like crazy.But it served me when I need it most</li>
            <li> My wife has very thin hair due to heredity and she has been so self conscious about it. We went to sally beauty and she tried on a wig it was 140 dollars, which was also synthetic and she hated it. The bangs were funky and didn&#x27;t look real. This was her first wig. This wig is awesome, it looks real and does not tangle. Its a beautiful color, the only reason she gave it a 4 is it was a little long and had to trim it, but otherwise great. I would buy this product again and i will. IT fits her well:) for $15 dollars its a steal.</li>
            <li> The hair is beautiful, the only problem I had was it was too small for my head...if you have smaller head this is a  gorgeous long hair to have. The manufacture was also prompt in shipping and handling returns. I will buy again from them.</li>
