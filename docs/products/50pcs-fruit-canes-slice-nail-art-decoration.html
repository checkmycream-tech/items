            <li>Cute designs</li>
            <li>But I was okay with that because after reading some comments I knew what to expect.</li>
            <li>These are so cute.</li>
            <li>but somehow I managed. :)</li>
            <li>The rest were Flowers and animals, and there were also many duplicates of those as well.</li>
            <li>and I cant wait to get more use out of them.</li>
            <li>I still don&#x27;t need to buy more X&#x27;D</li>
            <li>I love this product because it has 100 canes it the package</li>
            <li>TUTI FRUITIIII :-)</li>
            <li>These are very cute and lots of fun to put.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re all made very nice, are really pretty, and arrived fairly quickly, just not what was advertised, and not what I wanted.</li>
            <li>Easy to cut.  </li>
            <li>Easy to slice to the size I want them.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>SUPER CUTE</li>
            <li>I could definitely do some great nail art with them.</li>
            <li>I love these canes, they are amazing, a few of the animals were very detailed!</li>
            <li>Worth every penny!</li>
            <li>Other than that very excellent shipping service and arrived in exactly 2 weeks.</li>
            <li>When I first saw this item, I was very happy about the price and quantity because my daughter does polymer clay art with them and she is always needing the little fruits.</li>
            <li>Do not make them look like sweet caandy.</li>
            <li>No ugly surprises.</li>
            <li>I saw these little 3d stickies on the acrylics and loved the way they looked!</li>
            <li>These are absolutely adorable and are actually quite cheap for the quantity, quality, and variety that you get.  </li>
            <li>worth every penny</li>
            <li>Worth the money however.</li>
            <li>I was happy with the fruit canes I got; however, they seemed to be randomized as other reviews have said that they got certain canes that I didn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li>overall it&#x27;s a fun way to decorate your nails :)</li>
            <li>these are soft and easy to cut</li>
            <li>First of all, the shipping was very fast and prompt.  </li>
            <li>it well complement your whole weardrop!</li>
            <li>I love the different designs...</li>
            <li>I ordered these a couple days ago and was not expecting to receive them this fast!</li>
            <li>The rest of the other non-fruit canes were quite cute!</li>
            <li>They made sure I didn&#x27;t get the same one twice.</li>
            <li>On top of that i ONLY received 46 canes.</li>
            <li>Other then that they were pretty nice</li>
            <li>Love the cute designs, but it is hard to evenly slice off pieces to use as nail art.</li>
            <li>A whole lot of different shapes and creative canes.</li>
            <li>I ordered nail polish also and the nail polish and this product came in the same package which was fine</li>
            <li>very bright cute little tiny little thing.well</li>
            <li>no fruits or animals very dissatisfied</li>
            <li>Well balanced product, Thanks</li>
            <li>These weren&#x27;t even supposed to arrive for a couple more days, but they arrived sooner than expected.  </li>
            <li>Very.</li>
            <li>The delivery was really fast and arrived within the estimated time.</li>
            <li>I was very upset.</li>
            <li>People really are into the 3D look</li>
            <li>and I have so much</li>
            <li>I appreciate getting my order by Christmas,,, Its just as described and it comes with enough doubles and triples of different cute fruits.</li>
            <li>they come of easily because they dont lay flat on tiny nails.  </li>
            <li>I honestly do no think I will use the kiwi much, which is a shame since I got so many.</li>
            <li>The canes are very nice for what I will use them for--- only problem, I got like 20 kiwis, 15 strawberries, 5 limes, 1 tomato, one strange sun thing, one lemon, two apples, a strange pink thing in which I think is dragon or passion fruit, two lemons, and two bananas.</li>
            <li>They were smaller than expected, which was fine.</li>
            <li>But if you don&#x27;t really care and you like to experiment and try different looks with your nails like I do, then these are for you.</li>
            <li>I really wanted an equal amount of each (esp.</li>
            <li>It BARELY had any fruit designs.</li>

            <li> I really wanted an equal amount of each (esp.</li>
            <li> It BARELY had any fruit designs.</li>
            <li> It took a very long time for the seller to ship out the package, and when i finally received it, the little bag that the canes normally come in was torn and the canes were rolling all around inside the mailing package.</li>
            <li> Smaller than expected but arrived on time!</li>
            <li> They do not stay on very long, even with nail glue</li>
            <li> Wish I could got a little bit of different fruit canes.</li>
            <li> Not very pretty.</li>
            <li> then I expected.</li>
            <li> My first time ever getting canes so it was just to see how they look like and small they are!!!</li>
            <li> Although I saw other canes in the picture, I figured hey why not...and for the price, you can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
            <li> I also think they may be given out as a random assortment; I didn&#x27;t get all the exact canes in the picture</li>
            <li> i would recommend getting a proper slicing tool (4\\&quot; razor blade)so that the clay is cut as thin as possible.</li>
            <li> Just not worth the money I would have to pay to return the item.  </li>
            <li> So instead of at least getting 8 different types of fruit, I got 4 apple canes, 2 watermelon canes, and 2 strawberry canes.</li>
            <li> Because on the Product Description it says that not all canes are fruit, but a FEW of them are other styles.</li>
            <li> And please, do not advertise something that is not true.</li>
            <li> Yes, i am missing 4 canes.</li>
            <li> A FEW.</li>
            <li> but when I got it there were only like 6 fruit canes and like 30 flowers and 14 random ones.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re kinda stiff and gel like!</li>
            <li> I wish they came with the cutting blade or something to cut them properly with</li>
            <li> I mean call them nail art sticks or something.</li>
            <li> there were a few weird fruits that came in the package, i have no idea</li>
            <li> I was not happy with the way it was packaged and delivered either.</li>
            <li> Nothing like the picture, sadly.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed with this order, I feel like it was a waste of money for what i got.</li>
            <li> The issue is, NOT EVEN HALF WERE FRUIT!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I thought this was candy, I am very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Im very disappointed.</li>
            <li> If I was to give stars on the quality I would give 4 stars but the packaging was awful......</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Very happy with this order! They&#x27;re the perfect size and I&#x27;m happy I got repeats! Worth every penny! Thank you!</li>
            <li> All I got was 50 hearts no fruits or animals very dissatisfied</li>
            <li> I appreciate getting my order by Christmas,,, Its just as described and it comes with enough doubles and triples of different cute fruits. Well balanced product, Thanks</li>
            <li> The description read &amp;#34;fruit canes&amp;#34;. Although I saw other canes in the picture, I figured hey why not...and for the price, you can&#x27;t beat it. What I got was 50 hearts! All hearts!! No fruit, no animals, all hearts!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Not happy. Sending it back.</li>
            <li> First of all, the shipping was very fast and prompt.  These weren&#x27;t even supposed to arrive for a couple more days, but they arrived sooner than expected.  I was happy with that.  These are absolutely adorable and are actually quite cheap for the quantity, quality, and variety that you get.  I was happy with the fruit canes I got; however, they seemed to be randomized as other reviews have said that they got certain canes that I didn&#x27;t.  Again, I was happy with the ones I got, but DO NOT buy these expecting a certain cane to be included.  If you don&#x27;t like surprises and would rather know what canes you are going to get, then I wouldn&#x27;t recommend these.  I would go out to a beauty store and buy the ones there that you like, as you already know what they look like.  But if you don&#x27;t really care and you like to experiment and try different looks with your nails like I do, then these are for you.</li>
            <li> It arrived before the estimated date. i would recommend getting a proper slicing tool (4\\&quot; razor blade)so that the clay is cut as thin as possible. there were a few weird fruits that came in the package, i have no idea what fruit it was. overall it&#x27;s a fun way to decorate your nails :)</li>
            <li> I thought this was candy, I am very disappointed. I mean call them nail art sticks or something. Do not make them look like sweet caandy.</li>
            <li> yes i love it! very bright cute little tiny little thing.well i used it to put on my nails tip plus i add lots of jewel @ diamonds  etc..it well complement your whole weardrop! and will bring out your sexxyness.</li>
            <li> What I received did not look like the pictures.  I wanted what was represented on line not what I received.</li>
            <li> this was a good product but when i got this in the mail, the package was ripped and the plastic container which kept the canes secure was split and the canes were everywhere and some of the canes were broken. i think this package could of been better.</li>
            <li> For some reason I thought these were larger sticks of pre-rolled fimo. My mistake! They seem good for what they are supposed to be for!</li>
            <li> I love the different designs... I could definitely do some great nail art with them. The only problem I had was they were smaller then I expected. Other then that they were pretty nice&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. I wish they came with the cutting blade or something to cut them properly with</li>
            <li> I definitely give this item 5 stars! I was at the salon a week ago and was looking at the nail art stands... I saw these little 3d stickies on the acrylics and loved the way they looked! I asked the lady about them and told me where to find them! I ordered these a couple days ago and was not expecting to receive them this fast! To cut them, you basically take a razor blade and slice a teeny piece off the rod! They&#x27;re kinda stiff and gel like! I love this product!</li>
            <li> The canes are very nice for what I will use them for--- only problem, I got like 20 kiwis, 15 strawberries, 5 limes, 1 tomato, one strange sun thing, one lemon, two apples, a strange pink thing in which I think is dragon or passion fruit, two lemons, and two bananas. I really wanted an equal amount of each (esp. since I will use banana the most). I honestly do no think I will use the kiwi much, which is a shame since I got so many. Happy with the quality, though. Very nice, very detailed. Nothing like the picture, sadly.</li>
            <li> Perfect for nails or decorations in scrapbooks or phones cases!  Will order more when I need them.  Easy to cut.  Cute designs</li>
            <li> When I first saw this item, I was very happy about the price and quantity because my daughter does polymer clay art with them and she is always needing the little fruits. I waited a month and they finally came. The issue is, NOT EVEN HALF WERE FRUIT!!!!!!! The title says \\&quot;50 fruit canes\\&quot;, there werent even 20!!!!! Im very disappointed. Very.</li>
            <li> These were really nice. They were smaller than expected, which was fine. However, there weren&#x27;t a lot of actual &amp;#34;fruit&amp;#34; slices, only about 4 or five. But I was okay with that because after reading some comments I knew what to expect. The rest of the other non-fruit canes were quite cute! There was a cupcake, a bear, and many more!</li>
            <li> perfect loved it! worth every penny</li>
            <li> I had requested the fruit canes and ended up with something else.  Just not worth the money I would have to pay to return the item.  I did not like the ones I was sent.  Not very pretty.</li>
            <li> I love these canes, they are amazing, a few of the animals were very detailed! Smaller than expected but arrived on time!</li>
            <li> I wanted some canes to use as decoration for charms I make. Buying the 50 piece set on Amazon was cheaper than buying them at a beauty supply store. The canes are shorter than they seem in the picture, but besides that I have no problem with them. I also think they may be given out as a random assortment; I didn&#x27;t get all the exact canes in the picture but it is a 50 piece set. The delivery was really fast and arrived within the estimated time.</li>
            <li> If I was to give stars on the quality I would give 4 stars but the packaging was awful...... I ordered nail polish also and the nail polish and this product came in the same package which was fine but these weren’t even in a bag to hold together with instructions on how to use them. They were just thrown in the box, rolling around everywhere. I was very upset. I had to get on the internet to find out how to use them.</li>
            <li> These are so cute. They made sure I didn&#x27;t get the same one twice. Easy to slice to the size I want them.</li>
            <li> These are a great addition to my nail art collection.  I can not wait to use these with some of my designs. Excellent price and fast delivery. Would recommend to everyone.</li>
            <li> My first time ever getting canes so it was just to see how they look like and small they are!!! A whole lot of different shapes and creative canes. But also did get a lot of orange canes. Wish I could got a little bit of different fruit canes. Other than that very excellent shipping service and arrived in exactly 2 weeks. And they were quite tricky to cut but somehow I managed. :)</li>
            <li> I ordered this thinking i was going to get fruit canes, but what i got instead were flowers and animal designs. It BARELY had any fruit designs. I got about 8 canes of fruits, and there were duplicates. So instead of at least getting 8 different types of fruit, I got 4 apple canes, 2 watermelon canes, and 2 strawberry canes. The rest were Flowers and animals, and there were also many duplicates of those as well. I was not happy with the way it was packaged and delivered either. It took a very long time for the seller to ship out the package, and when i finally received it, the little bag that the canes normally come in was torn and the canes were rolling all around inside the mailing package. On top of that i ONLY received 46 canes. Yes, i am missing 4 canes. I am very disappointed with this order, I feel like it was a waste of money for what i got. I would NOT buy from this selling again. And please, do not advertise something that is not true. Because on the Product Description it says that not all canes are fruit, but a FEW of them are other styles. A FEW. I got the total opposite of that.</li>
            <li> I ordered these for fruit canes, as they&#x27;re advertised, but out of all 50 only 6 were fruit, and 3 of those are kiwi. They&#x27;re all made very nice, are really pretty, and arrived fairly quickly, just not what was advertised, and not what I wanted.</li>
            <li> All the designs are so adorable!  People really are into the 3D look and I cant wait to get more use out of them.</li>
            <li> I have had these about a year and I have so much and I do my nails twice a week! I still don&#x27;t need to buy more X&#x27;D plus you get hello kitty! SUPER CUTE</li>
            <li> This product was very cheap but when I got it there were only like 6 fruit canes and like 30 flowers and 14 random ones.</li>
            <li> I love this product because it has 100 canes it the package so I just added these to the ones I already had.</li>
            <li> Good product.. glad it comes with a lot. Easy to use. Can be a butt to cut though. But I do like the product.</li>
            <li> These are very cute and lots of fun to put.  They do not stay on very long, even with nail glue they come of easily because they dont lay flat on tiny nails.  Worth the money however.</li>
            <li> Love the cute designs, but it is hard to evenly slice off pieces to use as nail art. Even while using an Xacto knife.</li>
            <li> these are soft and easy to cut and you get what you see on site. No ugly surprises. TUTI FRUITIIII :-)</li>
