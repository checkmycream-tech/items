            <li>I just wasnt super impressed with the curling/smoothing ability.</li>
            <li>and it tangles very easy.</li>
            <li>Great value as these brushes sell for much higher at salons or sold separately.  </li>
            <li>It is an okay roundbrush for the price</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just ok.</li>
            <li>my daughter love it</li>
            <li>The air from the hair dryer seems to flow through this brush effectively and the handle is comfortable to hold</li>
            <li>I will buy more brushes, but just the brushes.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>therefore, this product if perfect to help her untangle the hair with less pain.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair but a lot of it</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t really feel like it&#x27;s doing anything amazing when I&#x27;m blow drying my hair.</li>
            <li>Cheap.</li>
            <li>It couldn&#x27;t even grip my bangs, which is the primary use...</li>
            <li>Originally purchased a set like these at a local hair salon, so happy to find these on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I love the original wet brush, and the hot brush is a nice addition, too!  </li>
            <li>The Wet Brush itself is great.  </li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m very satisfied with this purchase.</li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m very pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li>Smells similar to an auto store or tool store, but way more concentrated and powerful.  </li>
            <li>Go buy the Wet Brush separately because it&#x27;s 5 star for sure!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Shipping from PRO BEAUTY SUPPLY SOURCE was very fast, although I had to contact them after purchasing to get the correct color shipped.  </li>
            <li>Buying one for my whole family!</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t really used the hot brush.  </li>
            <li>love the wet brush, not the hot brush ...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really lightweight</li>
            <li>Love my wet brush.</li>
            <li>So this review it more for the wet brush.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I absolutely love the wet brush, the hot brush is kind of bulky and hard for me to use</li>
            <li>The wet brush works great, but not sure it&#x27;s any better than a regular brush.</li>
            <li>The only reason I gave it 4 stars was because the Hot Brush is not so hot...</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use the CurlBrush a lot because my daily styling brush is larger and works better.  </li>
            <li>, I would definitely buy it, it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>I have long wavy hair that is very tangled!!</li>
            <li>With that being said, the only reason this got 4 stars is because the &amp;#34;hot brush&amp;#34; is not so hot.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend the wet brush, but not the hot brush.</li>
            <li>Its so soft on your hair (and head).  </li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair and therefore don&#x27;t brush out my hair.  </li>
            <li>My entire family are true believers in the wet brush.  </li>
            <li>The round &#x27;hot&#x27; brush left a little more to be desired.</li>
            <li>However, I dry my bangs straight.  </li>
            <li>you can&#x27;t use this brush to brush your hair back because the bristles are so soft.</li>
            <li>The roller brush will scratch your scalp if you are not careful.  </li>
            <li>But, unless you have bigger hands or less hair the hot brush just doesn&#x27;t do it.</li>
            <li>Seriously, everyone needs one of these especially if you have long hair or hair that easily tangles.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t care for heat brush but can&#x27;t live without wet brush!</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve used the wet brush for years now bought this set for the curl brush...and neither of them work well at all.</li>
            <li> wet brush get tangles out easily&lt;</li>

            <li> THE WET BRUSH IS LITERALLY A BRUSH FROM HEAVEN! With that being said, the only reason this got 4 stars is because the &amp;#34;hot brush&amp;#34; is not so hot. Im a hairdresser so I&#x27;m picky about my round brushes and this one didnt impress me at all. It would be great for someone who just used it on their bangs. It is an okay roundbrush for the price I just wasnt super impressed with the curling/smoothing ability.</li>
            <li> The Wet Brush is amaze-balls! Seriously, everyone needs one of these especially if you have long hair or hair that easily tangles.  It glides seamlessly through your wet hair...Soooo awesome! The only reason I gave it 4 stars was because the Hot Brush is not so hot...lol. It&#x27;s really lightweight and I don&#x27;t really feel like it&#x27;s doing anything amazing when I&#x27;m blow drying my hair. It&#x27;s just ok. Go buy the Wet Brush separately because it&#x27;s 5 star for sure!</li>
            <li> Great value as these brushes sell for much higher at salons or sold separately.  Haven&#x27;t really used the hot brush.  The wet brush works great, but not sure it&#x27;s any better than a regular brush.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t care for heat brush but can&#x27;t live without wet brush!</li>
            <li> These brushes smell terrible. Smells similar to an auto store or tool store, but way more concentrated and powerful.  I tried washing the brushes with soap and water and even vinegar and it made no difference.  The smell was still there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shipping from PRO BEAUTY SUPPLY SOURCE was very fast, although I had to contact them after purchasing to get the correct color shipped.  I&#x27;ve requested a refund though.  I don&#x27;t want anything that smelly in my hair!</li>
            <li> This brush is great at getting tangles out of your hair.</li>
            <li> The brush is ok, but the curling brush was useless, does not go through my long hair.</li>
            <li> My entire family are true believers in the wet brush.  It truly detangles and you can use it on wet hair without breakage.  I use the round brush less often and it is rather wide.  However, it does a great job.  I gave these to my entire extended family for Christmas last year.  They are a &amp;#34;must have.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> The WetBrush definitely helps detangle and doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;rip&amp;#34; out hair when it&#x27;s wet.  I don&#x27;t use the CurlBrush a lot because my daily styling brush is larger and works better.  Overall, I&#x27;m very satisfied with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Work great band I have horrible thick curls</li>
            <li> my daughter love it she always had issues of her hair being tangle up after showering. therefore, this product if perfect to help her untangle the hair with less pain.</li>
            <li> I love the original wet brush, and the hot brush is a nice addition, too!  Overall, I&#x27;m very pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Cheap. I&#x27;ve used the wet brush for years now bought this set for the curl brush...and neither of them work well at all. Had to buy a different wet brush not happy with this purchase!</li>
            <li> Love my wet brush. Its so soft on your hair (and head).  It never tangles in my long wet hair.  I won&#x27;t use any other brush now. The round &#x27;hot&#x27; brush left a little more to be desired. Its too hard and the bristles are too short. It couldn&#x27;t even grip my bangs, which is the primary use...I round brush and blow dry only my bangs. I would highly recommend the wet brush, but not the hot brush.</li>
            <li> The round brush has no grip on the hair.</li>
            <li> Are you kidding me! Where has this brush been all my life! I have fine hair but a lot of it and it tangles very easy. I usually have to use detangler, leave in conditioner, etc. not with this brush. I am seriously shocked how amazing this brush is. Buying one for my whole family!</li>
            <li> I have long wavy hair that is very tangled!! This brush works awesome in shower.  I brush all the tangles out with conditioner in! I&#x27;ve never had a brush work so well!</li>
            <li> Really just purchased this set for the round brush, although the rest of my family seems to like the &amp;#34;paddle&amp;#34; brush.  I have naturally curly hair and therefore don&#x27;t brush out my hair.  However, I dry my bangs straight.  This is one of the best brushes I&#x27;ve purchased for that purpose.  The air from the hair dryer seems to flow through this brush effectively and the handle is comfortable to hold (it takes awhile to straighten my bangs).  Originally purchased a set like these at a local hair salon, so happy to find these on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the wet brush, the hot brush is kind of bulky and hard for me to use so I don&#x27;t use it. So this review it more for the wet brush.&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;The wet brush get tangles out easily&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t tear you hair out like other brushes&lt;br /&gt;You can use it on both wet and dry hair&lt;br /&gt;Nice look&lt;br /&gt;Easy handle (not too bulky/thin)&lt;br /&gt;Soft and plentiful bristles that don&#x27;t fall out&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;If you have thick hair or a lot of hair you can&#x27;t use this brush to brush your hair back because the bristles are so soft. I end up having to use a wide tooth comb to brush my hair back and part it. Gets kind of annoying having to switch between brushes.&lt;br /&gt;The hot brush is useless, too bulky and tangles with your hair easily especially when using your hair dryer. (Maybe they should come up with an easier design?)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, it you can buy the wet brush separately, I would definitely buy it, it&#x27;s worth it. But, unless you have bigger hands or less hair the hot brush just doesn&#x27;t do it.</li>
            <li> Good to use ,I will suggest my friends to buy it and it makes my hair become good to brush</li>
            <li> love the wet brush, not the hot brush ... bristles are too short and loose and won&#x27;t grab my hair.</li>
            <li> best brush ever! I have long hair that is currently being damaged lol I have dyed my hair black for years and decided to go back to my natural color and the lightneing process is killing my hair and when its wet it is almost unbrushable. this brush does the trick!</li>
            <li> The Wet Brush itself is great.  The roller brush will scratch your scalp if you are not careful.  I just mean it has very harsh points on the roller part.  I will buy more brushes, but just the brushes.&lt;br /&gt;Also, the tiny Wet Brushes go through baby hair tangles like nothing else.  Every baby needs one.</li>
