            <li>I am a very satisfied customer and will be using this product from now on!</li>
            <li>It does a great job at removing eye makeup</li>
            <li>I now know that the more gentile you treat your skin with good quality products  </li>
            <li>feels like lotion;  removes mascara, smells nice &amp; hetbal.</li>
            <li>It does its job and removes my makeup nicely.</li>
            <li>my face feels very smooth and i would although it doesn&#x27;t take off all of my eye makeup</li>
            <li>Have used this many times before.</li>
            <li>I like Avalon Organics better.</li>
            <li>I love Beauty without Cruelty.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite cleanser.</li>
            <li>love that it&#x27;s cruelty-free, but just that alone doesn&#x27;t help.</li>
            <li>You can use it for washing or just putting some on a tissue and wiping off your makeup, but I think the wash option yields better results.  </li>
            <li>I love this product, I use it to remove my make up</li>
            <li>Pleasant smelling and gentle but does not remove makeup well.</li>
            <li>Have tried many others, even other BWC cleansers and this one works best for me.  </li>
            <li>and I wanted a cruelty free product.  </li>
            <li>I have skin that can dry out very easily, but if I don&#x27;t wash it with some kind of cleanser, I will still break out.</li>
            <li>Package arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>My face feels clean and fresh after using this, but without feeling like a smile might tear my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I LOVE the Mia brush with the sensitive brush head!</li>
            <li>gentle and effective for my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Removed some makeup, but not well enough to be used on it&#x27;s own, even when I wore just tinted moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>texture was alright, pretty</li>
            <li>but this works way better for my dry skin.</li>
            <li>The name milk certainly describes this cleaner, feels like putting milk on your face.</li>
            <li>The pump broke off when I tried to open it, it smells quite strong, and doesn&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s really cleaning anything.</li>
            <li>It completely removes makeup and leaves my skin looking pretty!  </li>
            <li>Having been a long-time user of BWC&#x27;s alpha-hydroxy 3% facial cleaner, which I loved because of the very clean and fresh feeling it left with my skin, I realized that my dry and mildly mature skin needed something more gentle and less drying and wanted to try this BWC product for dry/mature skin.</li>
            <li>This is great because it really is extra gentle and does not make my skin feel dried out.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin feeling clean and not dry.</li>
            <li>Definitely gentle and non-irritating, but maybe a bit too gentle as it never seemed to get all of my make-up off.</li>
            <li>Cleans makeup off very well</li>
            <li>Personally I believe this version of the face cleanser is too lotion-y, but I love the actual lotion, and the face wash with the orange label.</li>
            <li>this gentile when I was in high school when I really needed it instead of all the super harsh chemicals I thought I needed to get my acne/ super oily skin to behave.</li>
            <li>This product is very creamy and leaves my face feeling so soft.  </li>
            <li>The cleanser is gentle, can be used around the eyes, and completely removed makeup without stinging or drying.</li>
            <li>biggest complaint about this is the pump, honestly.  </li>
            <li>i have very sensitive skin and was convinced this would break me out after a couple uses</li>
            <li>Most face washes (even \\&quot;natural\\&quot; and sulfate-free varieties) make me feel like my skin has shrunk three sizes too small for my face, but this one doesn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li>I still need to use a cotton swab to remove my eye make-up, but that was true with every other cleanser</li>
            <li>My mom, who has mature acne prone skin also uses this routine and has for about 4 years.</li>
            <li>This did nearly nothing for my skin.</li>
            <li>Gets me clean without feeling dried out or greasy.</li>
            <li>B002VAZINQ Clarisonic Mia Sonic Skin Cleansing System - White]] and alternate with [[ASIN:B001UE60E0 DHC Deep Cleansing Oil 6.7fl.oz./200ml]], which is another very gentile and natural facial cleanser.</li>
            <li>After weeks of usage with my standard facial cleaning techniques (same moisturizers, gentle makeup remover for my mascara, Konjac sponge, lukewarm water, and spot treatment.)</li>

            <li> I have skin that can dry out very easily, but if I don&#x27;t wash it with some kind of cleanser, I will still break out. This is great because it really is extra gentle and does not make my skin feel dried out.</li>

            <li> i have very sensitive skin and was convinced this would break me out after a couple uses but it didn&#x27;t. my face feels very smooth and i would although it doesn&#x27;t take off all of my eye makeup, i would def recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Have used this many times before. Lasts a long time - only need to use a small amount on face in the evening.</li>
            <li> I have been using BWC Cleaning Milk for about 5 years now. I wanted something that wouldn&#x27;t strip my sensitive skin and didn&#x27;t have a bunch of weird chemicals in it. I use it with my [[ASIN:B002VAZINQ Clarisonic Mia Sonic Skin Cleansing System - White]] and alternate with [[ASIN:B001UE60E0 DHC Deep Cleansing Oil 6.7fl.oz./200ml]], which is another very gentile and natural facial cleanser. I wish I would have had a skin cleansing regimen this gentile when I was in high school when I really needed it instead of all the super harsh chemicals I thought I needed to get my acne/ super oily skin to behave. I now know that the more gentile you treat your skin with good quality products  the less oil your skin will produce trying to hydrate itself. I haven&#x27;t had to use any acne products since I started using these three items. My mom, who has mature acne prone skin also uses this routine and has for about 4 years. She uses it to take off makeup as well and loves it. Definitely give this a chance and think about the other two products. I LOVE the Mia brush with the sensitive brush head!</li>
            <li> I had been using the BWC acne wash but this works way better for my dry skin. Gets me clean without feeling dried out or greasy. Had far less breakouts using it than with other &amp;#34;cleansing milk&amp;#34; face washes.</li>
            <li> I like Avalon Organics better.</li>

            <li> Pleasant smelling and gentle but does not remove makeup well.</li>
            <li> gentle and effective for my sensitive skin.  feels like lotion;  removes mascara, smells nice &amp; hetbal.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite cleanser. Have tried many others, even other BWC cleansers and this one works best for me.  It completely removes makeup and leaves my skin looking pretty!  And I&#x27;m 60.</li>
            <li> This did nearly nothing for my skin. After weeks of usage with my standard facial cleaning techniques (same moisturizers, gentle makeup remover for my mascara, Konjac sponge, lukewarm water, and spot treatment.) I really hated that this had no real upside in effectiveness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The texture was alright, pretty runny.&lt;br /&gt;The smell was alright, bearable without being a hassle.&lt;br /&gt;Didn&#x27;t cause an allergic breakout on my face, but rashes on my wrists to my elbows.&lt;br /&gt;Didn&#x27;t break me out, but didn&#x27;t help eliminate the cystic acne on my chin.&lt;br /&gt;Removed some makeup, but not well enough to be used on it&#x27;s own, even when I wore just tinted moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;I love that it&#x27;s cruelty-free, but just that alone doesn&#x27;t help.</li>
            <li> The pump broke off when I tried to open it, it smells quite strong, and doesn&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s really cleaning anything. I use Kose SoftyMo now.</li>
            <li> Definitely gentle and non-irritating, but maybe a bit too gentle as it never seemed to get all of my make-up off. Still looking.</li>
            <li> This is the best product that yields wonderful results.  My skin is aging and I needed a moisturizing cleanser and I wanted a cruelty free product.  This product is very creamy and leaves my face feeling so soft.  It has a wonderful massaging feel when I use it.  You can use it for washing or just putting some on a tissue and wiping off your makeup, but I think the wash option yields better results.  Cleans makeup off very well and you can also use it for eye makeup removal and not be concerned about getting it in your eyes.  I am a very satisfied customer and will be using this product from now on!</li>
            <li> My skin is dry.  Like, really dry.  Most face washes (even \\&quot;natural\\&quot; and sulfate-free varieties) make me feel like my skin has shrunk three sizes too small for my face, but this one doesn&#x27;t.  It does a great job at removing eye makeup (although, disclaimer, I don&#x27;t wear a lot of it on a daily basis).  The key to removing makeup is to apply this to a DRY face, then massage and rinse.  My face feels clean and fresh after using this, but without feeling like a smile might tear my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My biggest complaint about this is the pump, honestly.  It makes getting the last 20% or so of the product out a complete pain, and it often becomes partially clogged with product, making it shoot all wackadoodle, sometimes all over my wall.  I would prefer a tube with a flip cap.  Still, packaging won&#x27;t deter me.  This is definitely my face wash for as long as I can get ahold of it.</li>
            <li> The cleanser is gentle, can be used around the eyes, and completely removed makeup without stinging or drying. Just about perfect.</li>
            <li> Package arrived quickly. I love this product, I use it to remove my make up</li>
            <li> The name milk certainly describes this cleaner, feels like putting milk on your face. It does its job and removes my makeup nicely.</li>
            <li> the only cleanser I will use on my face</li>
            <li> It works well. I still need to use a cotton swab to remove my eye make-up, but that was true with every other cleanser I&#x27;ve tired.  I like this produce because it&#x27;s not tested on animals.</li>
