            <li>I liked this and will buy it again!</li>
            <li>Fantastic coverage, great color, and a wonderful deal to get all three products together!</li>
            <li>buy was a pleasant surprise for me.</li>
            <li>Makes me reminisc about the good ole days</li>
            <li>I apply it using a good brush</li>
            <li>I happen to get some sun this summer and need good coverage.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The powder gives the finishing touch, my sister told me she didn&#x27;t even recognize me because my skin looked so good, no joke.</li>
            <li>Good price for all three items.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a good medium coverage that is buildable and doesn&#x27;t look or feel cake-y.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I absolutely loved it</li>
            <li>Great stuff love</li>
            <li>very pleased with this purchase</li>
            <li>And in the summer months I go very light on my make-up and find the powder alone to be all that I need!</li>
            <li>My favorite make up!</li>
            <li>Absolutely satisfied!</li>
            <li>Love these!</li>
            <li>Pleased with purchase!</li>
            <li>I am in love!</li>
            <li>Love this!</li>
            <li>kit was so cute!</li>
            <li>This is the first time I&#x27;ve tried BB Cream, and I&#x27;m impressed!</li>
            <li>My complexion has been so much better since using this set!</li>
            <li>This is amazing.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s amazing</li>
            <li>The foundation is amazing.</li>
            <li>which is why I deducted 1 star) but because of over all better results,  I&#x27;m more than happy to purchase another PF concealer to go along with this.  </li>
            <li>and it does look nice.</li>
            <li>I am more of a Latin/European fair skin tone</li>
            <li>It evens out my skin and covers blemishes nicely.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own.</li>
            <li>The bb cream provides nice coverage and blends in nicely, leaving skin feeling hydrated but not sticky.</li>
            <li>The concealer pen/brush works well for blemishes and the powder is nice too.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to love this kit, but it&#x27;s just not that awesome (on me, anyway!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Since it&#x27;s a bit darker than my tone, I do need to make sure I blend it well, but it&#x27;s my favorite!</li>
            <li>Pretty good stuff for the price!</li>
            <li>It goes on silky but feels light, blends in perfectly with my skin to minimize the appearance of pores, and serves as a great primer under my Bare Minerals foundation.</li>
            <li>I absolutely, love love love Physicians Bb cream always have!</li>
            <li>LOVE, LOVE, LOVE!</li>
            <li>These are very good and are high quality also.</li>
            <li>I love this kit, BUT, the color is not light/medium.</li>
            <li>It is more of a tan color.</li>
            <li>it looks like I will be buying more..</li>
            <li>This product is my favorite concealer.</li>
            <li>It is very pricey at CVS and this package deal was a great buy.</li>
            <li>For the longest time I was able to get away with wearing tinted moisturizer, bronzer and mascara.  </li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>, I have olive/tan skin with acne scars and couldn&#x27;t recommend a product more.</li>
            <li>I think this product is just OK.  </li>
            <li>I like the CC cream better.</li>
            <li>they are much better price as a trio then buying one at a time.</li>
            <li>I love it..</li>
            <li>My favorite BB cream for the money.</li>
            <li>Love it, goes on effortlessly and is like applying moisturizer, combined w/</li>
            <li>(concealer sticks I don&#x27;t really use, but I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s a great product combined w/</li>
            <li>more BB cream foundation you apply</li>
            <li>, the more orange you are going to get.&lt;br /&gt;As</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s been okay.</li>
            <li>I have had more sun</li>
            <li>this is my favorite stuff.</li>
            <li>(of course I blended more...</li>
            <li>purchased this kit from ulta since they have a return policy if the makeup doesn&#x27;t work on you - and I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li>might give it ONE more try tomorrow - skipping the concealer and using the BB powder for concealer with my concealer</li>
            <li>I love Physicians Formula BB</li>
            <li>I used this for the first time today and can honestly say I am a satisfied customer!</li>
            <li>I feel like it would blend easily with many</li>
            <li>I decided to go out on a limb and try this, and I fell in love with how easy it is and</li>
            <li>This is a great value with nice results and I will definitely be buying again!!</li>
            <li>I bought light and it was more like a medium.</li>
            <li>So far, so great.</li>
            <li>It is important to put healthy beauty products on your skin.</li>
            <li>It does feel very light, which is nice, but it doesn&#x27;t really cover anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>My teenage daughters loved these in their easter  baskets!</li>
            <li>Three full sized products for this price?!</li>
            <li>I really like all these products and the price was exceptional.</li>
            <li>As a mom, these are quick and easy to apply, and make me look better than the zombie</li>
            <li>The product is fine.</li>
            <li>i have super oily skin, took a daytime nap, and i still had makeup on!</li>
            <li>This was a fantastic product for the price.  </li>
            <li>It goes on smooth</li>
            <li>my skin looked fantastic and not at all cakey or overly done up.</li>
            <li>I have always been a light medium</li>
            <li>It evens out skin tone, is light on the face, has all day staying power.</li>
            <li>if your looking for a decently priced makeup without parabens, you found it.&lt;br /&gt;Coverage is good and buildable if more coverage is needed and really with the concealer</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t keep in its original container.</li>
            <li>it was just what i expected although the color was a littlr bit lighter but other wise it was perfect.</li>
            <li>And this is right up there with them!</li>
            <li>(since I turned 30), I always had a nice, clear complexion and evenly toned skin</li>
            <li>I am a true medium skin tone...slightly yello undertone...</li>
            <li>The power is the only good part of this package and is cheaper to buy on</li>
            <li>If you are actually truly fair this isn&#x27;t going to work for you</li>
            <li>For the price and performance so far, I am thrilled I found this product.</li>
            <li>The price is not bad, which is why I rated three stars.  </li>
            <li>Great for skin in your late 40&#x27;s, any skin really that wants good coverage, and you are gifted the concealer as well as the BB</li>
            <li>powder is okay but works better over an alternate bb cream...</li>
            <li>It is super moisturizing, and it stays put all day.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I like the makeup , light but covers pretty well</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found it dries my skin out a tad, but as long as I moisturize with Coconut Oil at the end of the day, I&#x27;m good 😎</li>
            <li>beautifully it doesn&#x27;t make them worse like most products.</li>
            <li>The BB cream is a bit darker than I can wear-will need a bit of a tan first!</li>
            <li>So 5 stars for being an amazing value and also 5 stars for the actual BB Cream...</li>
            <li>This is the only brand makeup I wear and this is an AMAZING value.</li>
            <li>From what I understand, the Ingredients are more natural based than others.  </li>
            <li>I like physicians formula, however if you have light skin this product will make you look like an oompa lumpa, Although it says light/medium, be careful if you are an ivory kind of girl.</li>
            <li>i mean 24hours,  very good quality</li>
            <li>This was too dark for me in the winter, but now that summer has rolled around and my fair complexion is *slightly* darker, it blends in well and looks great.</li>
            <li>I put too much on the first day - and my under eye lines were obviously filled with concealer</li>
            <li>This is really good makeup, it last the whole day, and by whole day</li>
            <li>no amount of blending even when I tried blending it with a BB cream that was too fair for me toned down the orange look.</li>
            <li>It would probably be good if you have dark skin or are very very tan.</li>
            <li>Seems to be a good product, however, it is very dark orange.</li>
            <li>the brush provided with the powder is tiny and more often then not, I hurt my face with it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried just about every drug store brand make up in the last year and was never really satisfied with the results but stuck with Garnier Fructis because it had the best results,  until now.  </li>
            <li>To me, it smells like modeling clay and as I was an avid art student when I was in school, I like the smell.</li>
            <li>, so unsure if regular summer sun will help me match the color more.</li>
            <li>I love this product , can count on me for future purchasing.</li>
            <li>The powder compact runs out first.</li>
            <li>This is my first time using this brand..</li>
            <li>My favorite set up makeup use daily.</li>
            <li>really love this formula, and I will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li>Other reviews state that this item is light enough to work on the fair complected with some blending.</li>
            <li>I also love that it came with all the facial essentials concealer, foundation and powder because it is not always easy to color match different brands</li>
            <li>When I got this I thought the color was going to be too dark for me, but it blends nicely.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve ditched that brush and use a large makeup foundation brush instead.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My only issue with it was that it didn&#x27;t cover the fine lines on my forehead and around my eyes.</li>
            <li>I mix it with a tiny bit of moisturizer and then smooth over my face and blend very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>then I really like because with the warmer weather coming, I really don&#x27;t like to wear too much on my face.</li>
            <li>It covers very well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>, if i put too much on my face looks orange</li>
            <li>I really like this product.  </li>
            <li>Coverage is moderate but cream is light and non-oily.</li>
            <li>the whole kit is a must.</li>
            <li>The darkness under my eyes was obvious and the lines were filled with concealer.</li>
            <li>Much better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>And I&#x27;m very picky</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t usually wear makeup, and to be honest, I&#x27;ve always been intimidated by foundations</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s silky smooth and neither oily or dry.</li>
            <li>I love Physician&#x27;s Formula and had purchased the powder compact previously.</li>
            <li>looked suprisingly natural, matched my light toned red undertoned skin well, and stayed on.</li>
            <li>Having such a simple makeup routine prior to this kit, I was really happy to only have TWO color options to choose from!</li>
            <li>I really like this product, it goes on smooth and makes a great base for my foundation</li>
            <li>And love how it feels on my face and neck does not fill heavy at all.</li>
            <li>Once the foundation is blended in, my face just looked like my normal face.</li>
            <li>and im more pale, but</li>
            <li>I actually like this more than other BB Creams which I paid 3x as much for.</li>
            <li>i found new products to use.</li>
            <li>Kind of darker than I expected but not very noticeable.</li>
            <li>I have been searching high and low for a makeup set that would be gentle on my skin because I have very sensitive skin prone to breakouts.</li>
            <li>Product powder leaked causing a huge mess.</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;ve worked for large upper scale skin care lines.</li>
            <li>I have light skin prone to a little redness</li>
            <li>- the sample was a little light for Cali</li>
            <li>Overall I really like this makeup.</li>
            <li>This system is the best for coverage and by far the least irritating to my skin.  </li>
            <li>so much I went out and purchased the same in the &amp;#34;CC&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Now, I like the natural look...</li>
            <li>/&gt;As far as covering redness from pimples...</li>
            <li>the product is good , but the powder compact partido..muy get me wrong packaging</li>
            <li>but after a little practice and blending, I got it down to a science and absolutely love this product!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not crazy about the applicator for the liquid concealer, the CC cream is lighter than my other usual &amp;#34;medium&amp;#34; shade on my skin; and the powder, again is a bit too light.  </li>
            <li>The concealer is also thick and does not blend easily.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s got a light and airy feel to it, and doesn&#x27;t have any negative effects to it.</li>
            <li>The Garnier left my face feeling oily like the BB cream never dried.    </li>
            <li>Leaves my skin feeling silky soft and I only have to repowder once throughout the day!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a total package, such natural looking coverage!</li>
            <li>So far I am loving these products, especially the BB Cream which is the main reason I purchased it (at the time, this whole kit was less expensive than the BB Cream by itself!).</li>
            <li>It matches the other products very well...</li>
            <li>Definitely recommend especially for sensitive skin like mine.</li>
            <li>Love this make up, and got it for less than what I usually buy the powder itself.</li>
            <li>I really regret not trying the PF BB line or other facial products sooner.  </li>
            <li>It felt heavy the first day I used it</li>
    </ol>

            <li> BB cream is great.</li>
            <li> Smells good, feels good!</li>
            <li> This cover up works very nicely for me.</li>
            <li> and this is AMAZING!</li>
            <li> Then I saw this set for an amazing price (got all 3 items for the price of the powder!)</li>
            <li> I liked this and will buy it again!</li>
            <li> Fantastic coverage, great color, and a wonderful deal to get all three products together!</li>
            <li> buy was a pleasant surprise for me.</li>
            <li> Makes me reminisc about the good ole days</li>
            <li> I apply it using a good brush</li>
            <li> I happen to get some sun this summer and need good coverage.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The powder gives the finishing touch, my sister told me she didn&#x27;t even recognize me because my skin looked so good, no joke.</li>
            <li> Good price for all three items.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s a good medium coverage that is buildable and doesn&#x27;t look or feel cake-y.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I absolutely loved it</li>
            <li> Great stuff love</li>
            <li> very pleased with this purchase</li>
            <li> And in the summer months I go very light on my make-up and find the powder alone to be all that I need!</li>
            <li> My favorite make up!</li>
            <li> Absolutely satisfied!</li>
            <li> Love these!</li>
            <li> Pleased with purchase!</li>
            <li> I am in love!</li>
            <li> Love this!</li>
            <li> kit was so cute!</li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve tried BB Cream, and I&#x27;m impressed!</li>
            <li> My complexion has been so much better since using this set!</li>
            <li> This is amazing.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s amazing</li>
            <li> The foundation is amazing.</li>
            <li> which is why I deducted 1 star) but because of over all better results,  I&#x27;m more than happy to purchase another PF concealer to go along with this.  </li>
            <li> and it does look nice.</li>
            <li> I am more of a Latin/European fair skin tone</li>
            <li> It evens out my skin and covers blemishes nicely.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s own.</li>
            <li> The bb cream provides nice coverage and blends in nicely, leaving skin feeling hydrated but not sticky.</li>
            <li> The concealer pen/brush works well for blemishes and the powder is nice too.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to love this kit, but it&#x27;s just not that awesome (on me, anyway!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Since it&#x27;s a bit darker than my tone, I do need to make sure I blend it well, but it&#x27;s my favorite!</li>
            <li> Pretty good stuff for the price!</li>
            <li> It goes on silky but feels light, blends in perfectly with my skin to minimize the appearance of pores, and serves as a great primer under my Bare Minerals foundation.</li>
            <li> I absolutely, love love love Physicians Bb cream always have!</li>
            <li> LOVE, LOVE, LOVE!</li>
            <li> These are very good and are high quality also.</li>
            <li> I love this kit, BUT, the color is not light/medium.</li>
            <li> It is more of a tan color.</li>
            <li> it looks like I will be buying more..</li>
            <li> This product is my favorite concealer.</li>
            <li> It is very pricey at CVS and this package deal was a great buy.</li>
            <li> For the longest time I was able to get away with wearing tinted moisturizer, bronzer and mascara.  </li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> , I have olive/tan skin with acne scars and couldn&#x27;t recommend a product more.</li>
            <li> I think this product is just OK.  </li>
            <li> I like the CC cream better.</li>
            <li> they are much better price as a trio then buying one at a time.</li>
            <li> I love it..</li>
            <li> My favorite BB cream for the money.</li>
            <li> Love it, goes on effortlessly and is like applying moisturizer, combined w/</li>
            <li> (concealer sticks I don&#x27;t really use, but I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s a great product combined w/</li>
            <li> more BB cream foundation you apply</li>
            <li> , the more orange you are going to get.&lt;br /&gt;As</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s been okay.</li>
            <li> I have had more sun</li>
            <li> this is my favorite stuff.</li>
            <li> (of course I blended more...</li>
            <li> purchased this kit from ulta since they have a return policy if the makeup doesn&#x27;t work on you - and I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li> might give it ONE more try tomorrow - skipping the concealer and using the BB powder for concealer with my concealer</li>
            <li> I love Physicians Formula BB</li>
            <li> I used this for the first time today and can honestly say I am a satisfied customer!</li>
            <li> I feel like it would blend easily with many</li>
            <li> I decided to go out on a limb and try this, and I fell in love with how easy it is and</li>
            <li> This is a great value with nice results and I will definitely be buying again!!</li>
            <li> I bought light and it was more like a medium.</li>
            <li> So far, so great.</li>
            <li> It is important to put healthy beauty products on your skin.</li>
            <li> It does feel very light, which is nice, but it doesn&#x27;t really cover anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> My teenage daughters loved these in their easter  baskets!</li>
            <li> Three full sized products for this price?!</li>
            <li> I really like all these products and the price was exceptional.</li>
            <li> As a mom, these are quick and easy to apply, and make me look better than the zombie</li>
            <li> The product is fine.</li>
            <li> i have super oily skin, took a daytime nap, and i still had makeup on!</li>
            <li> This was a fantastic product for the price.  </li>
            <li> It goes on smooth</li>
            <li> my skin looked fantastic and not at all cakey or overly done up.</li>
            <li> I have always been a light medium</li>
            <li> It evens out skin tone, is light on the face, has all day staying power.</li>
            <li> if your looking for a decently priced makeup without parabens, you found it.&lt;br /&gt;Coverage is good and buildable if more coverage is needed and really with the concealer</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t keep in its original container.</li>
            <li> it was just what i expected although the color was a littlr bit lighter but other wise it was perfect.</li>
            <li> And this is right up there with them!</li>
            <li> (since I turned 30), I always had a nice, clear complexion and evenly toned skin</li>
            <li> I am a true medium skin tone...slightly yello undertone...</li>
            <li> The power is the only good part of this package and is cheaper to buy on</li>
            <li> If you are actually truly fair this isn&#x27;t going to work for you</li>
            <li> For the price and performance so far, I am thrilled I found this product.</li>
            <li> The price is not bad, which is why I rated three stars.  </li>
            <li> Great for skin in your late 40&#x27;s, any skin really that wants good coverage, and you are gifted the concealer as well as the BB</li>
            <li> powder is okay but works better over an alternate bb cream...</li>
            <li> It is super moisturizing, and it stays put all day.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I like the makeup , light but covers pretty well</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found it dries my skin out a tad, but as long as I moisturize with Coconut Oil at the end of the day, I&#x27;m good 😎</li>
            <li> beautifully it doesn&#x27;t make them worse like most products.</li>
            <li> The BB cream is a bit darker than I can wear-will need a bit of a tan first!</li>
            <li> So 5 stars for being an amazing value and also 5 stars for the actual BB Cream...</li>
            <li> This is the only brand makeup I wear and this is an AMAZING value.</li>
            <li> From what I understand, the Ingredients are more natural based than others.  </li>
            <li> I like physicians formula, however if you have light skin this product will make you look like an oompa lumpa, Although it says light/medium, be careful if you are an ivory kind of girl.</li>
            <li> i mean 24hours,  very good quality</li>
            <li> This was too dark for me in the winter, but now that summer has rolled around and my fair complexion is *slightly* darker, it blends in well and looks great.</li>
            <li> I put too much on the first day - and my under eye lines were obviously filled with concealer</li>
            <li> This is really good makeup, it last the whole day, and by whole day</li>
            <li> no amount of blending even when I tried blending it with a BB cream that was too fair for me toned down the orange look.</li>
            <li> It would probably be good if you have dark skin or are very very tan.</li>
            <li> Seems to be a good product, however, it is very dark orange.</li>
            <li> the brush provided with the powder is tiny and more often then not, I hurt my face with it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried just about every drug store brand make up in the last year and was never really satisfied with the results but stuck with Garnier Fructis because it had the best results,  until now.  </li>
            <li> To me, it smells like modeling clay and as I was an avid art student when I was in school, I like the smell.</li>
            <li> , so unsure if regular summer sun will help me match the color more.</li>
            <li> I love this product , can count on me for future purchasing.</li>
            <li> The powder compact runs out first.</li>
            <li> This is my first time using this brand..</li>
            <li> My favorite set up makeup use daily.</li>
            <li> really love this formula, and I will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> Other reviews state that this item is light enough to work on the fair complected with some blending.</li>
            <li> I also love that it came with all the facial essentials concealer, foundation and powder because it is not always easy to color match different brands</li>
            <li> When I got this I thought the color was going to be too dark for me, but it blends nicely.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ditched that brush and use a large makeup foundation brush instead.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My only issue with it was that it didn&#x27;t cover the fine lines on my forehead and around my eyes.</li>
            <li> I mix it with a tiny bit of moisturizer and then smooth over my face and blend very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> then I really like because with the warmer weather coming, I really don&#x27;t like to wear too much on my face.</li>
            <li> It covers very well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> , if i put too much on my face looks orange</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  </li>
            <li> Coverage is moderate but cream is light and non-oily.</li>
            <li> the whole kit is a must.</li>
            <li> The darkness under my eyes was obvious and the lines were filled with concealer.</li>
            <li> Much better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And I&#x27;m very picky</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually wear makeup, and to be honest, I&#x27;ve always been intimidated by foundations</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s silky smooth and neither oily or dry.</li>
            <li> I love Physician&#x27;s Formula and had purchased the powder compact previously.</li>
            <li> looked suprisingly natural, matched my light toned red undertoned skin well, and stayed on.</li>
            <li> Having such a simple makeup routine prior to this kit, I was really happy to only have TWO color options to choose from!</li>
            <li> I really like this product, it goes on smooth and makes a great base for my foundation</li>
            <li> And love how it feels on my face and neck does not fill heavy at all.</li>
            <li> Once the foundation is blended in, my face just looked like my normal face.</li>
            <li> and im more pale, but</li>
            <li> I actually like this more than other BB Creams which I paid 3x as much for.</li>
            <li> i found new products to use.</li>
            <li> Kind of darker than I expected but not very noticeable.</li>
            <li> I have been searching high and low for a makeup set that would be gentle on my skin because I have very sensitive skin prone to breakouts.</li>
            <li> Product powder leaked causing a huge mess.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;ve worked for large upper scale skin care lines.</li>
            <li> I have light skin prone to a little redness</li>
            <li> - the sample was a little light for Cali</li>
            <li> Overall I really like this makeup.</li>
            <li> This system is the best for coverage and by far the least irritating to my skin.  </li>
            <li> so much I went out and purchased the same in the &amp;#34;CC&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Now, I like the natural look...</li>
            <li> /&gt;As far as covering redness from pimples...</li>
            <li> the product is good , but the powder compact partido..muy get me wrong packaging</li>
            <li> but after a little practice and blending, I got it down to a science and absolutely love this product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not crazy about the applicator for the liquid concealer, the CC cream is lighter than my other usual &amp;#34;medium&amp;#34; shade on my skin; and the powder, again is a bit too light.  </li>
            <li> The concealer is also thick and does not blend easily.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s got a light and airy feel to it, and doesn&#x27;t have any negative effects to it.</li>
            <li> The Garnier left my face feeling oily like the BB cream never dried.    </li>
            <li> Leaves my skin feeling silky soft and I only have to repowder once throughout the day!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a total package, such natural looking coverage!</li>
            <li> So far I am loving these products, especially the BB Cream which is the main reason I purchased it (at the time, this whole kit was less expensive than the BB Cream by itself!).</li>
            <li> It matches the other products very well...</li>
            <li> Definitely recommend especially for sensitive skin like mine.</li>
            <li> Love this make up, and got it for less than what I usually buy the powder itself.</li>
            <li> I really regret not trying the PF BB line or other facial products sooner.  </li>
            <li> It felt heavy the first day I used it</li>
            <li> For the price I got it at, which was less than half of what the local store wanted, it was worth it.</li>
            <li> Not great, but not bad either.</li>
            <li> I have a very oily complexion and while I still have to use an oil absorber sheet, I only have to do it once during the late afternoon.</li>
            <li> you apply a thin layer all over your face (only as much as you need to even out your skin tone), blending very well as you go, follow with a little concealer on any noticeable imperfections, then set with the powder, you will be fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> No rose to my undertone and this works VERY well with my skin.</li>
            <li> but, it would probably also be to yellow for someone with pink undertones.</li>
            <li> The BB crème and the concealer lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> company should probably re-label this color &amp;#34;medium&amp;#34; since a lot of other reviewers seem to have similar issues.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have oily or dry skin.</li>
            <li> the others seems to look dry and ashy on my skin.</li>
            <li> typically use Physicians Formula loose mineral powder as my only foundation AND also as concealer.</li>
            <li> Looked very dry, caked and cracked.</li>
            <li> At first I thought this was a little dark for my PALE skin!  </li>
            <li> My biggest problem was when I opened the BB cream it practically exploded pouring out of the tube in gobs the size of a quarter wasting at least a quarter of a tube on first opening if not more.  </li>
            <li> This product was a lot darker than I expected it to be.</li>
            <li> I do not really tan ever</li>
            <li> The kit comes in a few different shades.</li>
            <li> Product was just what I expected.</li>
            <li> so a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> , FAIR-SKINNED LADIES, A LITTLE GOES A LONG WAY WITH THIS SHADE!&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> With other BB creams I&#x27;m shiny an hour after applying and remain that way.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> Other reviews said this dries your face out.</li>
            <li> I like using it other places on my face...</li>
            <li> Tried other BB creams.</li>
            <li> I used these the other day.</li>
            <li> the other 2)</li>
            <li> I am EXTREMELY light-skinned.</li>
            <li> other reviews have said, you are going to look like an Ooompa Loompa if you apply too much.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I had to give to my Daughter because so dark.</li>
            <li> only complaint--</li>
            <li> The ONLY thing I can say negatively about this is the included concealer does not cover redness as well as</li>
            <li> The makeup stays put all day long and works as well as the MAC and Bobbi Brown foundations that I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wear this because of how dark it is for my skin tone, but kept it anyway in case</li>
            <li> I Luke the products, but they are too dark for my skin tone.  </li>
            <li> so I never needed anything other than a little eye make up.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t look as shiny and in no way clogs my pores (a few of the other brands did).  </li>
            <li> Today I used MUCH less concealer...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little heavier</li>
            <li> Light/medium shade is very dark.</li>
            <li> I can wear this when I am pale or when I have a little tan.</li>
            <li> I use all three everyday.</li>
            <li> I recommend this if you aren&#x27;t pale</li>
            <li> The BB Powder was broken into loose powder.</li>
            <li> but very little.  </li>
            <li> not sure i&#x27;m applying it correctly...</li>
            <li> Am not sure if the product I&#x27;ve gotten is not expired as there&#x27;s no expiration date on it.</li>
            <li> Not a favorite for me.</li>
            <li> So I had to remove it and use my usual PF mineral powder for concealer.</li>
            <li> I am pale!</li>
            <li> The bb cream is incredibly thick and causes breakouts.</li>
            <li> Both are very thick, I have to thin down in order to use and not look too made up.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;the bb cream covers but creases in any small line and makes the lines look WORSE</li>
            <li> but it is just to thin for my liking around my eyes.  </li>
            <li> WHAT A MESS :(</li>
            <li> (applicator is useless) just like mineral powder users have been doing for years.  </li>
            <li> I think I got wrong color though.</li>
            <li> Sad face rating from me......</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m incredibly disappointed in this product.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;ve never been disappointed by Phys.</li>
            <li> The base feels like makeup should, not oily, but moisturizing.</li>
            <li> I hate being overwhelmed with options!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> I love this kit, BUT, the color is not light/medium. Wonderful makeup but I had to give to my Daughter because so dark. It is more of a tan color. Proper labeling would be medium/tan.</li>
            <li> My teenage daughters loved these in their easter  baskets! The price was awesome too!</li>
            <li> Gives me such a glow I just started wearing it now it looks like I will be buying more..</li>
            <li> This product is my favorite concealer. It is very pricey at CVS and this package deal was a great buy.</li>
            <li> Great kit and 9.00 cheaper than Target and Walmart. Light/medium shade is very dark. I had to return.</li>
            <li> Product powder leaked causing a huge mess.Have used the concelaer and the BB cream.  Both are very thick, I have to thin down in order to use and not look too made up.  Have no idea about the powder as it was unusable and leaked all over package.</li>
            <li> This is really good makeup, it last the whole day, and by whole day i mean 24hours,  very good quality</li>
            <li> You cannot beat this deal. Three full sized products for this price?! Overall I really like this makeup. I have a very oily complexion and while I still have to use an oil absorber sheet, I only have to do it once during the late afternoon. With other BB creams I&#x27;m shiny an hour after applying and remain that way.&lt;br /&gt;Also if your looking for a decently priced makeup without parabens, you found it.&lt;br /&gt;Coverage is good and buildable if more coverage is needed and really with the concealer included you don&#x27;t need to pile it on.&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint--the brush provided with the powder is tiny and more often then not, I hurt my face with it. I&#x27;ve ditched that brush and use a large makeup foundation brush instead.&lt;br /&gt;LOVE the SPF 30.</li>
            <li> Seems to be a good product, however, it is very dark orange. As another review said, it makes you look like an oompa loompa. It would probably be good if you have dark skin or are very very tan.</li>
            <li> When this item arrived at my address. The BB Powder was broken into loose powder. It was spilling out of it container. I couldn&#x27;t keep in its original container. Powder EVERYWHERE. WHAT A MESS :(</li>
            <li> not the coverage i was looking for.... then again, i&#x27;m used to solely liquid foundation, so ii&#x27;m not sure i&#x27;m applying it correctly...</li>
            <li> Great makeup ever!!! Love it!!!</li>
            <li> This is the best match to my skin tone I have found yet!!  *it is about $2.50 cheaper on walmart.com*  Until the last year or so (since I turned 30), I always had a nice, clear complexion and evenly toned skin so I never needed anything other than a little eye make up. Some thing happened when I turned 30 and my hormones went haywire changing all that.  I&#x27;ve tried just about every drug store brand make up in the last year and was never really satisfied with the results but stuck with Garnier Fructis because it had the best results,  until now.  Other reviews said this dries your face out. I don&#x27;t have oily or dry skin. I use Ponds facial moisturizer 30 minutes before applying my make up so it has time to soak in. The Garnier left my face feeling oily like the BB cream never dried.    That is not the case with the PF. I touch my face and it&#x27;s silky smooth and neither oily or dry. I really regret not trying the PF BB line or other facial products sooner.  Some people have made comments about the smell and I didn&#x27;t find it offensive.  To me, it smells like modeling clay and as I was an avid art student when I was in school, I like the smell. Makes me reminisc about the good ole days lol.  The ONLY thing I can say negatively about this is the included concealer does not cover redness as well as the Garnier did (which is why I deducted 1 star) but because of over all better results,  I&#x27;m more than happy to purchase another PF concealer to go along with this.  Over all:  This is a great value with nice results and I will definitely be buying again!!</li>
            <li> For the longest time I was able to get away with wearing tinted moisturizer, bronzer and mascara.  As I am careening into my 50s, I can no longer do that.  My skin just has different texture and color to it (thank you sun!).  Anyhoo...this product is the closest I have come to what I used to use.  I love it.  The cream is thicker than moisturizer...so a little goes a long way.  I mix it with a tiny bit of moisturizer and then smooth over my face and blend very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On sunny days, the powder seems lighter to me - so I will wear it.  I apply it using a good brush (applicator is useless) just like mineral powder users have been doing for years.  It covers very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The concealer is meh.  It matches the other products very well...but it is just to thin for my liking around my eyes.  I like using it other places on my face...but it feels like it &amp;#34;runs&amp;#34; in the oily sections under my eyes.  I use a thicker concealer under my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this helps.  I am a true medium skin tone...slightly yello undertone...but very little.  No rose to my undertone and this works VERY well with my skin.</li>
            <li> This was a fantastic product for the price.  The makeup stays put all day long and works as well as the MAC and Bobbi Brown foundations that I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> Great makeup. I think I got wrong color though. im really white, if i put too much on my face looks orange and I have blemishes that it doesn&#x27;t cover up well. But it is great makeup. I recommend this if you aren&#x27;t pale lol&lt;br /&gt;Also arrived on time</li>
            <li> This is amazing. Saved money buying all three together, and the products are great. I had been using the Physicians formula CC cream before this, and it was the only makeup that didn&#x27;t make my skin break out. My only issue with it was that it didn&#x27;t cover the fine lines on my forehead and around my eyes. This BB cream goes on thicker and covers the lines! Love it. Definitely recommend especially for sensitive skin like mine.</li>
            <li> My face looks flawless when I wear this makeup.</li>
            <li> Tried other BB creams. This system is the best for coverage and by far the least irritating to my skin.  From what I understand, the Ingredients are more natural based than others.  My favorite make up!</li>
            <li> The only thing I like from this set is the concealer  the others seems to look dry and ashy on my skin. Am not sure if the product I&#x27;ve gotten is not expired as there&#x27;s no expiration date on it.</li>
            <li> The powder and concealer are perfect. The BB cream is a bit darker than I can wear-will need a bit of a tan first!</li>
            <li> This was too dark for me in the winter, but now that summer has rolled around and my fair complexion is *slightly* darker, it blends in well and looks great. This combination of products give a great flawless coverage. I like the consistency of the product and the ease of applying it. For the price I got it at, which was less than half of what the local store wanted, it was worth it. This is currently my summer-go-to for coverage.</li>
            <li> This product was a lot darker than I expected it to be. For now mixing it with another foundation makes it wearable for me and it does look nice. I do not really tan ever, so unsure if regular summer sun will help me match the color more. I am more of a Latin/European fair skin tone but, it would probably also be to yellow for someone with pink undertones.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wear this because of how dark it is for my skin tone, but kept it anyway in case I happen to get some sun this summer and need good coverage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The company should probably re-label this color &amp;#34;medium&amp;#34; since a lot of other reviewers seem to have similar issues.</li>
            <li> Ive been using PF for about two years. i think its because of the winter and im more pale, but it started to turn my skin into an orange tint.  i found new products to use.</li>
            <li> I have light skin prone to a little redness and this is AMAZING! I use all three everyday. Since it&#x27;s a bit darker than my tone, I do need to make sure I blend it well, but it&#x27;s my favorite! It evens out my skin and covers blemishes nicely. I&#x27;ve found it dries my skin out a tad, but as long as I moisturize with Coconut Oil at the end of the day, I&#x27;m good 😎</li>
            <li> Thank you! Absolutely satisfied! I love this product , can count on me for future purchasing. The base feels like makeup should, not oily, but moisturizing. The powder gives the finishing touch, my sister told me she didn&#x27;t even recognize me because my skin looked so good, no joke. Blends with my skin so well! I feel like it would blend easily with many, I have olive/tan skin with acne scars and couldn&#x27;t recommend a product more.</li>
            <li> The product is fine. A bit bugged that it was all open or, just not properly wrapped.</li>
            <li> This cover up works very nicely for me. After this one I use bronzes and one for blondes, as a mix!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m incredibly disappointed in this product. The bb cream is incredibly thick and causes breakouts. The concealer is also thick and does not blend easily. The power is the only good part of this package and is cheaper to buy on it&#x27;s own.</li>
            <li> the product is good , but the powder compact partido..muy get me wrong packaging</li>
            <li> I personally didn&#x27;t like this product. The kit comes in a few different shades. I bought light and it was more like a medium. I also found that the foundation looked like it was caked on.</li>
            <li> Product was just what I expected.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  It does wear off throughout the day, but I do not powder or reapply.  It goes on smooth and I do like the coverage.  I would buy this product again.</li>
            <li> I think this product is just OK.  I&#x27;m not crazy about the applicator for the liquid concealer, the CC cream is lighter than my other usual &amp;#34;medium&amp;#34; shade on my skin; and the powder, again is a bit too light.  I will use the CC cream, but the others will need to go away.  The price is not bad, which is why I rated three stars.  Otherwise, it&#x27;s a 2 in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I really like this product, it goes on smooth and makes a great base for my foundation</li>
            <li> Fantastic coverage, great color, and a wonderful deal to get all three products together! Leaves my skin feeling silky soft and I only have to repowder once throughout the day! As a mom, these are quick and easy to apply, and make me look better than the zombie I feel like!</li>
            <li> Love these! Awesome coverage with SPF.</li>
            <li> I like the CC cream better.</li>
            <li> Physicians Formula products never disappoint me.</li>
            <li> I used these the other day. And love how it feels on my face and neck does not fill heavy at all. I will be ordering another set they are much better price as a trio then buying one at a time.</li>
            <li> I Luke the products, but they are too dark for my skin tone.  So I cannot use the products.</li>
            <li> Awesome, wish they would drop the price again</li>
            <li> Good price for all three items. The powder compact runs out first. The BB crème and the concealer lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I am so happy I found this product.  I like it so much I went out and purchased the same in the &amp;#34;CC&amp;#34; line.&lt;br /&gt;I did purchase the medium color - the sample was a little light for Cali</li>
            <li> Great stuff love it works well</li>
            <li> I really like all these products and the price was exceptional. The color is perfect. The bb cream provides nice coverage and blends in nicely, leaving skin feeling hydrated but not sticky. The concealer pen/brush works well for blemishes and the powder is nice too. Perfect for my light/medium skin.</li>
            <li> This is my first time using this brand.. it&#x27;s amazing I love it.. u do have to blend it in well or you&#x27;ll  look orange  if u don&#x27;t.. once the make up settles it blends in with your skin tone... very pleased with this purchase</li>
            <li> Like it . Meduim coverage ....universal color .</li>
            <li> I have been searching high and low for a makeup set that would be gentle on my skin because I have very sensitive skin prone to breakouts. I used this for the first time today and can honestly say I am a satisfied customer! It feels like I&#x27;m not even wearing makeup which is great and the coverage is very good. I also love that it came with all the facial essentials concealer, foundation and powder because it is not always easy to color match different brands so having this All-in-1 was great. Will repurchase.</li>
            <li> Great coverage!&lt;br /&gt;Perfect match color</li>
            <li> My favorite set up makeup use daily.</li>
            <li> Pleased with purchase!</li>
            <li> My favorite BB cream for the money. Coverage is moderate but cream is light and non-oily.</li>
            <li> i have super oily skin, took a daytime nap, and i still had makeup on! this stuff is awesome. the whole kit is a must. my skin looked fantastic and not at all cakey or overly done up. looked suprisingly natural, matched my light toned red undertoned skin well, and stayed on. will buy again and again. switched to this from the pf bb all in one.</li>
            <li> I like physicians formula, however if you have light skin this product will make you look like an oompa lumpa, Although it says light/medium, be careful if you are an ivory kind of girl. I gave it to my sister who has darker skin and she loves it and it looks great on her.</li>
            <li> At first I thought this was a little dark for my PALE skin!  But, I&#x27;m not used to wearing tons of foundation.  It felt heavy the first day I used it but after a little practice and blending, I got it down to a science and absolutely love this product!</li>
            <li> I just received this a day ago! I am in love! I was using a different BB cream that was too oily for my face. This kit truly gives me a flawless finish and I don&#x27;t even need to use my foundation. So far, so great. I&#x27;m very happy. Great price for a concealer, BB cream, and powder. Love this!</li>
            <li> Pretty good stuff for the price!</li>
            <li> I love Physician&#x27;s Formula and had purchased the powder compact previously. Then I saw this set for an amazing price (got all 3 items for the price of the powder!) The foundation is amazing. I had been using a L&#x27;Oreal version of this and was very happy with it...until I got Physician&#x27;s Formula&#x27;s version! Love it, goes on effortlessly and is like applying moisturizer, combined w/ the powder it&#x27;s a total package, such natural looking coverage! (concealer sticks I don&#x27;t really use, but I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s a great product combined w/ the other 2), I&#x27;ve never been disappointed by Phys. Form. And in the summer months I go very light on my make-up and find the powder alone to be all that I need!</li>
            <li> powder is okay but works better over an alternate bb cream...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the bb cream covers but creases in any small line and makes the lines look WORSE</li>
            <li> I am EXTREMELY light-skinned. As in, lightest shade of makeup you can buy, light.&lt;br /&gt;This buy was a pleasant surprise for me. It is super moisturizing, and it stays put all day.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a good medium coverage that is buildable and doesn&#x27;t look or feel cake-y.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Keep in mind though, FAIR-SKINNED LADIES, A LITTLE GOES A LONG WAY WITH THIS SHADE!&lt;br /&gt;The more BB cream foundation you apply, the more orange you are going to get.&lt;br /&gt;As other reviews have said, you are going to look like an Ooompa Loompa if you apply too much.&lt;br /&gt;If you apply a thin layer all over your face (only as much as you need to even out your skin tone), blending very well as you go, follow with a little concealer on any noticeable imperfections, then set with the powder, you will be fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really love this formula, and I will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> When I got this I thought the color was going to be too dark for me, but it blends nicely.  It&#x27;s a little heavier then I really like because with the warmer weather coming, I really don&#x27;t like to wear too much on my face. I&#x27;ve been using it sparingly around my eye area and it&#x27;s been okay.</li>
            <li> Not a favorite for me. Looked very dry, caked and cracked. Sad face rating from me......</li>
            <li> Great products for a great price.</li>
            <li> I have always been a light medium but this color seems to be warmer than I remember for the brand. I mix it with a neutral powder to lighten it untill I have had more sun</li>
            <li> Great Product,Thank you</li>
            <li> this is my favorite stuff. I am pale! like whitest shade u can get . I can wear this when I am pale or when I have a little tan. I also get breakoutsand not only does this kit cover them  beautifully it doesn&#x27;t make them worse like most products.</li>
            <li> Other reviews state that this item is light enough to work on the fair complected with some blending. If you are actually truly fair this isn&#x27;t going to work for you no amount of blending even when I tried blending it with a BB cream that was too fair for me toned down the orange look. Its darker than the photo. My biggest problem was when I opened the BB cream it practically exploded pouring out of the tube in gobs the size of a quarter wasting at least a quarter of a tube on first opening if not more.  Returning to amazon immediately.</li>
            <li> BB cream is great. Covers spots and evens color. Powder leaves you with a metallic looking tone. Not great, but not bad either.</li>
            <li> I wanted to like this...but I just don&#x27;t. It does feel very light, which is nice, but it doesn&#x27;t really cover anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I typically use Physicians Formula loose mineral powder as my only foundation AND also as concealer. So I am a fan of PF! I am 32 now and was starting to notice that using just a powder foundation/concealer was not working so well for my under eye area. Also, it was begining to crease on my eye lids. So I thought I would check out this kit (along with some overpriced face and eye primers...those didn&#x27;t work at all, fyi).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The kit was so cute! The color looked darker in the tube, but as it went on my face the color blended well. Having such a simple makeup routine prior to this kit, I was really happy to only have TWO color options to choose from! I hate being overwhelmed with options!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me get to the bottom line - I&#x27;ve tried this kit twice now, and it just doesn&#x27;t cut it for me. Once the foundation is blended in, my face just looked like my normal face. Now, I like the natural look...but I&#x27;d also like my occassional blemishes to be covered. So I bust out the concealer - it doesn&#x27;t conceal. I put too much on the first day - and my under eye lines were obviously filled with concealer (of course I blended more...but then the darkness was obvious). Today I used MUCH less concealer...and it doesn&#x27;t conceal. The darkness under my eyes was obvious and the lines were filled with concealer. So I had to remove it and use my usual PF mineral powder for concealer. Much better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as covering redness from pimples...no such luck there either. I had to powder it up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this kit from ulta since they have a return policy if the makeup doesn&#x27;t work on you - and I&#x27;m glad I did. I really wanted to love this kit, but it&#x27;s just not that awesome (on me, anyway!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I might give it ONE more try tomorrow - skipping the concealer and using the BB powder for concealer with my concealer brush.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll add an update if that works well.</li>
            <li> So far I am loving these products, especially the BB Cream which is the main reason I purchased it (at the time, this whole kit was less expensive than the BB Cream by itself!). So 5 stars for being an amazing value and also 5 stars for the actual BB Cream... It goes on silky but feels light, blends in perfectly with my skin to minimize the appearance of pores, and serves as a great primer under my Bare Minerals foundation. I actually like this more than other BB Creams which I paid 3x as much for. It doesn&#x27;t look as shiny and in no way clogs my pores (a few of the other brands did).  For the price and performance so far, I am thrilled I found this product.</li>
            <li> Kind of darker than I expected but not very noticeable. I liked this and will buy it again!</li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve tried BB Cream, and I&#x27;m impressed! I don&#x27;t usually wear makeup, and to be honest, I&#x27;ve always been intimidated by foundations so I just never wear them. I decided to go out on a limb and try this, and I fell in love with how easy it is and how well it blends with my skin tone. It&#x27;s got a light and airy feel to it, and doesn&#x27;t have any negative effects to it. My life has definitely been changed.</li>
            <li> I absolutely, love love love Physicians Bb cream always have! Smells good, feels good! I would not trade this for anything. Also I bought this with the mineral wear.</li>
            <li> Awesome products! My complexion has been so much better since using this set!</li>
            <li> I absolutely loved it it was just what i expected although the color was a littlr bit lighter but other wise it was perfect.</li>
            <li> Great for skin in your late 40&#x27;s, any skin really that wants good coverage, and you are gifted the concealer as well as the BB cream.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a He** of a deal. Doesn&#x27;t smother your skin either!! And I&#x27;m very picky, I&#x27;ve worked for large upper scale skin care lines. I&#x27;ve used the best of the best. And this is right up there with them!</li>
            <li> I love Physicians Formula BB All In 1 Beauty Balm. It evens out skin tone, is light on the face, has all day staying power. It has given me a youthful glow.</li>
            <li> I like the makeup , light but covers pretty well</li>
            <li> Arrived on time in excellent condition. This is the only brand makeup I wear and this is an AMAZING value.</li>
            <li> powder was all over the place instead of in the container.</li>
            <li> I looooove it! it&#x27;s quite efficient. A must buy</li>
            <li> It is important to put healthy beauty products on your skin. These are very good and are high quality also.</li>
            <li> Love this make up, and got it for less than what I usually buy the powder itself. LOVE, LOVE, LOVE! Thank you!</li>
