            <li>What an ingenious design!</li>
            <li>I know that it isn&#x27;t quite what it was intended for, but I love that I can wear this with my sunglasses!</li>
            <li>I love these headbands!  </li>
            <li>They wear great and are comfortable while I&#x27;m wearing them.</li>
            <li>Nice.</li>
            <li>They blend into my hair which is also excellent as I don&#x27;t like headbands that stand out too much.</li>
            <li>Nice that they don&#x27;t squeeze your head off though.</li>
            <li>I prefer the memory foam headbands by this brand, which are excellent for fine/thin hair, whether your hair is straight or wavy.</li>
            <li>These are more than a good product, they are a blessing.</li>
            <li>These are nice, and work well without causing headache or sore head from pressure of the band on it.</li>
            <li>Break very easily.</li>
            <li>Good for use with fine hair.</li>
            <li>Absolutely, THEY were the best, and I&#x27;d love to order more of them, as I managed to break one of mine.  </li>
            <li>A set of 3 very stylish and comfortable to wear head bands.  </li>
            <li>They were very comfortable, before they broke.</li>
            <li>These are very comfortable, and have teeth to hold your hair also.</li>
            <li>Very comfortable, just as advertised, thank you.</li>
            <li>very very comfortable</li>
            <li>Yes, these are very light.</li>
            <li>Very comfortable, but they can slip a bit more than others.  </li>
            <li>They are cute and very light weight</li>
            <li>Perfect fit for an adult head, with no headaches!</li>
            <li>and I just need to keep it out of my face or have a cute look with the added headband.</li>
            <li>CUTE HANGING ON A HOOK IN MY BATHROOM.</li>
            <li>Most, even the so-called &amp;quot;ouchless&amp;quot; ones, give me a headache</li>
            <li>I love these and will buy many more.</li>
            <li>These are my tween daughter&#x27;s favorite headbands.</li>
            <li>better than nothing.</li>
            <li>I just bout 2 more packs.</li>
            <li>Love them.</li>
            <li>Still on the search for headbands that don&#x27;t hurt as I love headbands</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not even sure how I&#x27;m supposed to put it on with the bend on the bottom of the hairband.</li>
            <li>I love these hair bands and have been looking for them everywhere.</li>
            <li>Such a great product!</li>
            <li>These work great with wearing glasses, and are very lightweight and don&#x27;t hurt my head.</li>
            <li>Love these headbands, never give me a headache</li>
            <li>I love them and for a while couldn&#x27;t find them again</li>
            <li>and I love them</li>
            <li>That is how often I use it and how much I love it.</li>
            <li>I love the no headache design of the Vidal Sassoon headbands.  </li>
            <li>I have never been able to wear a headband for any length of time because of the headache I would get from the pressure on my temples.</li>
            <li>I was able to wear the darker head bands all day with no headache.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many brands that claim comfort, but these are the ones to get.</li>
            <li>I wish they could make them more fashionable.</li>
            <li>It goes over the top of your ear and</li>
            <li>The price has gone up since I bought mine, but I still am thinking of buying two more sets.  </li>
            <li>I am so glad you posted them on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Think when you perch glasses on the top of your head -- they work a lot like that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I wish they had them in more colors because I would for sure buy them too.</li>
            <li>Too comfortable, even for a girl with glasses!</li>
            <li>I love these.  </li>
            <li>I love this band.</li>
            <li>I needed some cute head bands and I love these for so many reasons.</li>
            <li>I am not in love with this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad to have these that don&#x27;t pinch my head.  </li>
            <li>I love these headbands.</li>
            <li>I am able to wear them with my glasses and work an 8 hour shift.</li>
            <li>I love it and will buy again if I lose them all 3.</li>
            <li>OK.... Not as strong as I hoped</li>
            <li>Also, when it does keep my hair back, my hair just does not look very good.  </li>
            <li>They have always been my favorite headbands because they are so comfortable, that I do not know that they are there.</li>
            <li>They are great for anyone who has a sensitive head.</li>
            <li>They are comfortable, flexible, and I wish like all get out that I could find more of this design in a wider range of colors</li>
            <li>too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But whatever, they&#x27;re barely more than a buck apiece, and they work fabulously.</li>
            <li>One has snapped within 2 months but I still think these are better than others as they are comfortable.</li>
            <li>They feel remarkably resilient for their slimness in their new, unused condition.</li>
            <li>Instead of putting pressure on your temple the specially designed band works by very lightly hugging the contours of your skull.</li>
            <li>Bendable but somewhat easy to break.  </li>
            <li>They are inexpensive and easily replaced here on Amazon.</li>
            <li>But they break REAAAAALLY easily.</li>
            <li>They were delivered very quickly.</li>
            <li>It seems like they could so easily be made stronger, but I guess they&#x27;re so cheap and light this way -- and I&#x27;m sure planned obsolescence plays a role,</li>
            <li>so they break easily.  </li>
            <li>They stay in place in her fine hair.</li>
            <li>They work fine, can wear one all day with out a head ache.</li>
            <li>so the others work fine.</li>
            <li>At first I thought it was perfect since it was so light weight and bent around the back of my head.</li>
            <li>very comfortable to wear and just the right width.  </li>
            <li>Also the no headache description isn&#x27;t accurate for me.</li>
            <li>Keeps the hair out of my eyes and greatly reduces - though doesn&#x27;t totally eliminate - head discomfort.</li>
            <li>And wearing a comfortable headband is headline news in my mind.&lt;br</li>
            <li>coz they were comfortable.</li>
            <li>Cheap material.</li>
            <li>--this doesn&#x27;t appear to be available via Amazon, but I did find it on Etsy.</li>
            <li>These stay comfortable all day</li>
            <li>Also they don&#x27;t fit my head at all-</li>
            <li>I am so happy I finally found them!</li>
            <li>I forget I&#x27;m wearing them, they&#x27;re that comfortable.</li>
            <li>these are light and grip</li>
            <li>The curve doesn&#x27;t really fit to my head, feels like parts bulge out on the side.</li>
            <li>I loved the comfort of these headbands; however, the first one broke the first time I tried to slide it on my head.  </li>
            <li>They are tight a bit the other ziz zag ones of his are perfect, nice colors though, good value for the headbands.</li>
            <li>True, they don&#x27;t give you a headache, but they break easily.</li>
            <li>so I treated my first set preciously.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll happily keep buying them as long</li>
            <li>I really like these headbands, they are very comfortable.</li>
            <li>I have a rather large head and most plastic bands</li>
            <li>These are great, but also pretty fragile.</li>
            <li>They are true to advertising, no-headache headbands.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Second, the teeth on these is only on the sides, and is totally smooth on the top, so it does nothing to hold the hair on top in place at all.</li>
            <li>For the most part they aren&#x27;t even very noticeable.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The shape is perfect, at least for my head, and it doesn&#x27;t pinch.  </li>
            <li>Good price, arrived promptly, but a bit big for my head.</li>
            <li>they are not painful at all, and can be worn with sunglasses.</li>
            <li>These  were worth the cost to provide comfortable hair control without any headaches or head soreness.</li>
            <li>My hair is very fine, and everything normally slips off of my head...</li>
            <li>They really don&#x27;t fit right.  </li>
            <li>They are exactly what they are called-thin, but strong, and they don&#x27;t cause headaches.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re simple, unobtrusive and, most importantly, don&#x27;t give me pain!  </li>
            <li>Once I put these on the correct way, they did a super job of keeping my baby-fine hair out of my face.  </li>
            <li>My daughter will not wear regular headbands but she really needs them with her wild hair-these are perfect!</li>
            <li>For the price especially I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I have fine straight hair and these do the job of keeping my hair out of my face.</li>
            <li>think success with these may have to do with your type of hair.</li>
            <li>I do have a giant head, and I love these because they fit.  </li>
            <li>The ends tuck up in my hairline for a seamless look, love it.</li>
            <li>These are the only headbands that I have been able to find with the curved ends that allow one to wear glasses comfortably.</li>
            <li>These headbands are not an effective way to hold bangs back.</li>
            <li>Actually it did kind of make my head hurt</li>
            <li>Yes, it&#x27;s true that these are painless, but they also don&#x27;t hold back my rather abundant hair very well.</li>
            <li>They curve by the ear and don&#x27;t sit on your head right.</li>
            <li>Wearing one right now.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found them more comfortable to hold my hair back while doing yoga than the more traditional elastic wraps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great for thin, fine hair.</li>
            <li>The good news is that they are not too tight.</li>
            <li>These are definitely much more comfortable than other headbands I&#x27;ve tried, and I don&#x27;t think they would cause headaches like others would.</li>
            <li>Many of Sassoon&#x27;s hair accessories fit women who have large brain cases, but be careful -- not all Sassoon items do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t get headaches with this style but there is still enough discomfort that I&#x27;m glad to take it off when no longer needed.</li>
            <li>within the first month 2 out of 3 broke for no reason</li>
            <li>My first set of three lasted 9 months</li>
            <li>look exactly like pictures here.  </li>
            <li>These work really well for me!  </li>
            <li>Wish I could get some different colors, but these will do in most cases.</li>
            <li>Really cute and the ONLY headbands that don&#x27;t give me a headache, even among those that are advertised as &amp;#34;no headache&amp;#34; (get your act together, Goody!).</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>It sits exactly where you put it and doesn&#x27;t slip.</li>
            <li>I wish they came in more colors or the option to get them all in the same color.</li>
            <li>These headbands are my second favorite headbands.  </li>
            <li>Great design &amp; style which really won&#x27;t give you any headaches, but it was just too big for me, just wish they sold them in a tad smaller size.</li>
            <li>I have to say these work pretty well for me.  </li>
            <li>I have never been able to tolerate regular head bands, they give me a headache.</li>
            <li>They have definitely changed how these&#x27;re made, and not for the better.</li>
            <li>Mine broke the first day I wore one.</li>
            <li>Does not last more than a week.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s kinda more for show than for actually, you know, holding hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Also, they don&#x27;t show much at all!</li>
            <li>The straight headbands hurt after 10 minutes and stretchy headbands roll off my head right away.</li>
            <li>These are nice, I do forget that I have them on, they don&#x27;t pinch behind my ears like most.</li>
            <li>I dig the thinness of these, but with that comes the inevitable... they break so easily.</li>
            <li>I do have super thick hair, so it falls over the headband easily, however they are comfortable.</li>
            <li>I realize these are low priced, but didn&#x27;t expect that they would break so easily.</li>
            <li>The headbands are good to keep hair back but break very easily and still does hurt behind the ear.</li>
            <li>I HAVE A REALLY LARGE HEAD.</li>
            <li>I thought they&#x27;d only hold fine hair...</li>
            <li>It looks perfectly fine but doesn&#x27;t necessarily keep my hair in place.  </li>
            <li>Seriously no headaches!</li>
            <li>i have super thick hair, and these do a great job at holding my hair back.</li>
            <li>These headbands are classy looking enough for the office and are very comfortable to wear all day.  </li>
            <li>However, I prefer the zig-zag ones a little better because these are a bit loose and would be better if they were more snug (and my head is on the big side).</li>
            <li>They do seem a little flimsy at first, but if you are careful, they do the job beautifully.  </li>
            <li>These are thin which is great but also very flimsy.</li>
            <li>but they also don&#x27;t fit my head properly at all.</li>
            <li>They work very well for my hair style</li>
            <li>Gift that was appreciated.</li>
            <li>Very brittle plastic.  </li>
            <li>I thought headbands were comfortable enough</li>
            <li>but this is on a whole another level.</li>
            <li>These arrived fast.</li>
            <li>They were packaged securely but I only used each of them once because they all broke.</li>
            <li>This may be because they don&#x27;t fit my head properly, but I still now have to buy another headband that does the job for me.</li>
            <li>These are very breakable</li>
            <li>This is truly the only headband that is comfortable.</li>
            <li>I think you would have to have a giant head for these things to fit your correctly.  </li>
            <li>They really work for me.</li>
            <li>These really work.</li>
            <li>they are wide and make me look like I have horns on the top of my head.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t really stay put.</li>
            <li>These are very flexible-  their design seems to keep them off pressure points of the head stimulating pain.  </li>
            <li>I have a head like a high school football coach&#x27;s, so it&#x27;s important to me to look as feminine as possible.</li>
            <li>The beige color which looks orange in the image is actually a good color and blends quite well with dark blonde colored hair.</li>
            <li>The comfort and style are worth major points though</li>
            <li>but I must say that they are remarkable for how thin they are.</li>
            <li>But overall not bad.</li>
            <li>I wish they made them in a slightly wider headband, too, though, because these tend to get lost under my hair pretty easily.</li>
            <li>I love the versatility of getting 3 colors, blond, tortoise, and black.</li>
            <li>What a clever product.</li>
            <li>The headband does curl backward, but they still sit low on the head just above the top of the ear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t worn headbands since high school</li>
            <li>But if you&#x27;re careful, they&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
            <li>They are okay a little on the flimsy slide.  </li>
            <li>As noted in other reviews, they break easily, so I deduct one star.  </li>
            <li>They do break easily, I have learned to treat them very carefully.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t even been able to use it, turned out to be a waste of money.</li>
            <li>One of the headbands broke within a week of normal use.</li>
            <li>The other two seem fine.</li>
            <li>They are super thin, so they aren&#x27;t as stylish as I&#x27;d like, but I can deal with it.</li>
            <li>And by curve, I mean it&#x27;s like they are made to kind of wrap around the ear or something.</li>
            <li>and I am buying a new set today.</li>
            <li>They break much less easily, but they&#x27;re unusable as headbands.</li>
            <li>They pretty much break if you look at them too long.</li>
            <li>These are very flimsy and don&#x27;t really hold your hair back.  </li>
            <li>I can wear these pretty much all day long without pressure on my scalp.</li>
            <li>Though I can get significantly more time out of them than other styles before the pain begins, it inevitably shows up about 4 hours in.</li>
            <li>They haven&#x27;t so far though!</li>
            <li>Works a lot better than the traditional headbands, due to the shape of the &amp;#34;no headache&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>They aren&#x27;t going to slide neatly into place unless I find myself some sandpaper and smooth down the edges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>True, the hairband is very light and does not &amp;#34;pinch.&amp;#34;  However, it does a poor job of keeping hair back too.  </li>
            <li>The style is simple and elegant, which I think could be worn by both men and women, and comes in three hair shades: black, blond, and brown.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My only complaint is that they are so thin and flexible  and don&#x27;t exactly match my head shape, so they don&#x27;t have the greatest hold in my hair.  </li>
            <li>These seemed like a good idea but were very thin and broke within a day of normal usage.</li>
            <li>They sit touching the top of my head and behind my ears, with the rest of the headband resting about a half an inch away from my scalp.  </li>
            <li>They aren&#x27;t strong enough to actually hold my hair back, so when I put them on</li>
            <li>Some headbands claim to be headache-free, and while they are comfortable for the first hour, they often hurt eventually, especially in the area right behind my ears.</li>
            <li>That means you have to add it to a larger order totaling a certain amount</li>
            <li>I usually don&#x27;t wear headbands at home for the simple reason I get headaches very easy.  </li>
            <li>I was suspicious at first, they appeared at first sight a little flimsy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re not made to fit really snug, or at least they didn&#x27;t on me</li>
            <li>I wish they had them in clear plastic.</li>
            <li>They firmly hold hair without constricting your head, so you could comfortably wear them all day.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I tried putting one of these headbands on about 20 times before I eventually just gave up and threw it in the trash because it&#x27;s far too flimsy to hold my hair in place for any length of time at all.</li>
            <li>i am an adult</li>
            <li>They are so lightweight and soft</li>
            <li>Of course this time I will not let my 3 year old get a hold of these.  </li>
            <li>obviously made from high quality materials!</li>
            <li>not so comfortable after a few minutes.</li>
            <li>I literally said, &amp;quot;nooo!&amp;quot; out loud.</li>
            <li>These are complete junk.</li>
            <li>Far too flimsy.</li>
            <li>These bands hold back hair very well and do not dig into the skin.</li>
            <li>no-headache - loved them, and so did my son, unfortunately.</li>
            <li>: I just ordered some more of these great headbands, and I&#x27;m disappointed to receive some that are softer, thinner, and generally less robust than the old ones.</li>
            <li>but I have thick, long hair &amp; I love them!  </li>
            <li>I really liked the design of them, folding back into your hairline instead of clamping down around the back of your ear, but that doesn&#x27;t really help when all of them snap in half at the barest hint of pressure.</li>
            <li>The headbands curve slightly over the ears, toward the back of the head, and they&#x27;re comfortable.</li>
            <li>Oddly shaped and really doesn&#x27;t do much for my hair...</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have a small head by any means and these things were huge on me.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Lastly, the price is very affordable, so if you need them, don&#x27;t wait too long.  </li>
            <li>They fit my small head as well as any others I have found.</li>
            <li>The missing teeth also make it so that even though the bangs are pushed back, there isn&#x27;t a smooth look.</li>
            <li>These headbands did not fit my head- primarily because the ends curve back.</li>
            <li>I was so very hopeful, after the majority of previous reviews were so positive, that these would actually be headache-free headbands.</li>
            <li>The shape doesn&#x27;t work super well for actually holding your hair back, and is rather loose on the head.</li>
            <li>These probably would not hold back a heavy head of hair, but  if you have fine or thin hair you&#x27;ll love these.</li>
            <li>The arms of the headband curve back in a really smart way, so the headband sit flat against your head, instead of digging in to hold on.</li>
            <li>Only thing that could possibly make them better is if they could be made of a soft plastic instead of the hard plastic.</li>
            <li>I had a couple other VS headbands that my 3 year old snapped that really were</li>
            <li>However, I don&#x27;t understand how anyone can wear these with glasses without having to push the headband way back on the head until it nearly falls off.</li>
            <li>Love these thin headbands - all others would give me headaches.  </li>
            <li>I love the idea of a headband that doesn&#x27;t push against behind my ears</li>
            <li>only complaint is that they break relatively easily.</li>
            <li>I think because it lays up higher on my head and not where a typical headband lays.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re too soft and flexible to hold my hair in place -- and I have really fine, thin hair.</li>
            <li>If you have harder to manage hair or very curly hair, I don&#x27;t think these will hold it back.</li>
            <li>I do have a head that is more narrow than round.</li>
            <li>I have very thin straight hair, so the job should be relatively easy, but the headband can barely keep my hair back while moving about.  </li>
            <li>these headbands are so weak that they break easily.</li>
            <li>The only negative is that they are so thin &amp; light they break easily when traveling.</li>
            <li>Having been forewarned by other reviews, I patiently tried to gently position the second one.  </li>
            <li>but I really prefer to wear my hair down</li>
            <li>It hits the bone on the side of my head, behind the ears, and slips off fairly easily.</li>
            <li>but my hair isn&#x27;t super thick.</li>
            <li>These are pretty and comfortable, but they are a little thin</li>
            <li>The tips on these headbands are bent to the side so they won&#x27;t press on the bone behind my ear, sure, but that implies that they&#x27;d stay on my head long enough for that to matter.&lt;br</li>
            <li>They do not hold my hair and I have thin fine hair.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Nice.</li>
            <li> They blend into my hair which is also excellent as I don&#x27;t like headbands that stand out too much.</li>
            <li> Nice that they don&#x27;t squeeze your head off though.</li>
            <li> I prefer the memory foam headbands by this brand, which are excellent for fine/thin hair, whether your hair is straight or wavy.</li>
            <li> These are more than a good product, they are a blessing.</li>
            <li> These are nice, and work well without causing headache or sore head from pressure of the band on it.</li>
            <li> Break very easily.</li>
            <li> Good for use with fine hair.</li>
            <li> Absolutely, THEY were the best, and I&#x27;d love to order more of them, as I managed to break one of mine.  </li>
            <li> A set of 3 very stylish and comfortable to wear head bands.  </li>
            <li> They were very comfortable, before they broke.</li>
            <li> These are very comfortable, and have teeth to hold your hair also.</li>
            <li> Very comfortable, just as advertised, thank you.</li>
            <li> very very comfortable</li>
            <li> Yes, these are very light.</li>
            <li> Very comfortable, but they can slip a bit more than others.  </li>
            <li> They are cute and very light weight</li>
            <li> Perfect fit for an adult head, with no headaches!</li>
            <li> and I just need to keep it out of my face or have a cute look with the added headband.</li>
            <li> CUTE HANGING ON A HOOK IN MY BATHROOM.</li>
            <li> Most, even the so-called &amp;quot;ouchless&amp;quot; ones, give me a headache</li>
            <li> I love these and will buy many more.</li>
            <li> These are my tween daughter&#x27;s favorite headbands.</li>
            <li> better than nothing.</li>
            <li> I just bout 2 more packs.</li>
            <li> Love them.</li>
            <li> Still on the search for headbands that don&#x27;t hurt as I love headbands</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not even sure how I&#x27;m supposed to put it on with the bend on the bottom of the hairband.</li>
            <li> I love these hair bands and have been looking for them everywhere.</li>
            <li> Such a great product!</li>
            <li> These work great with wearing glasses, and are very lightweight and don&#x27;t hurt my head.</li>
            <li> Love these headbands, never give me a headache</li>
            <li> I love them and for a while couldn&#x27;t find them again</li>
            <li> and I love them</li>
            <li> That is how often I use it and how much I love it.</li>
            <li> I love the no headache design of the Vidal Sassoon headbands.  </li>
            <li> I have never been able to wear a headband for any length of time because of the headache I would get from the pressure on my temples.</li>
            <li> I was able to wear the darker head bands all day with no headache.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many brands that claim comfort, but these are the ones to get.</li>
            <li> I wish they could make them more fashionable.</li>
            <li> It goes over the top of your ear and</li>
            <li> The price has gone up since I bought mine, but I still am thinking of buying two more sets.  </li>
            <li> I am so glad you posted them on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Think when you perch glasses on the top of your head -- they work a lot like that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I wish they had them in more colors because I would for sure buy them too.</li>
            <li> Too comfortable, even for a girl with glasses!</li>
            <li> I love these.  </li>
            <li> I love this band.</li>
            <li> I needed some cute head bands and I love these for so many reasons.</li>
            <li> I am not in love with this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad to have these that don&#x27;t pinch my head.  </li>
            <li> I love these headbands.</li>
            <li> I am able to wear them with my glasses and work an 8 hour shift.</li>
            <li> I love it and will buy again if I lose them all 3.</li>
            <li> OK.... Not as strong as I hoped</li>
            <li> Also, when it does keep my hair back, my hair just does not look very good.  </li>
            <li> They have always been my favorite headbands because they are so comfortable, that I do not know that they are there.</li>
            <li> They are great for anyone who has a sensitive head.</li>
            <li> They are comfortable, flexible, and I wish like all get out that I could find more of this design in a wider range of colors</li>
            <li> too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But whatever, they&#x27;re barely more than a buck apiece, and they work fabulously.</li>
            <li> One has snapped within 2 months but I still think these are better than others as they are comfortable.</li>
            <li> They feel remarkably resilient for their slimness in their new, unused condition.</li>
            <li> Instead of putting pressure on your temple the specially designed band works by very lightly hugging the contours of your skull.</li>
            <li> Bendable but somewhat easy to break.  </li>
            <li> They are inexpensive and easily replaced here on Amazon.</li>
            <li> But they break REAAAAALLY easily.</li>
            <li> They were delivered very quickly.</li>
            <li> It seems like they could so easily be made stronger, but I guess they&#x27;re so cheap and light this way -- and I&#x27;m sure planned obsolescence plays a role,</li>
            <li> so they break easily.  </li>
            <li> They stay in place in her fine hair.</li>
            <li> They work fine, can wear one all day with out a head ache.</li>
            <li> so the others work fine.</li>
            <li> At first I thought it was perfect since it was so light weight and bent around the back of my head.</li>
            <li> very comfortable to wear and just the right width.  </li>
            <li> Also the no headache description isn&#x27;t accurate for me.</li>
            <li> Keeps the hair out of my eyes and greatly reduces - though doesn&#x27;t totally eliminate - head discomfort.</li>
            <li> And wearing a comfortable headband is headline news in my mind.&lt;br</li>
            <li> coz they were comfortable.</li>
            <li> Cheap material.</li>
            <li> --this doesn&#x27;t appear to be available via Amazon, but I did find it on Etsy.</li>
            <li> These stay comfortable all day</li>
            <li> Also they don&#x27;t fit my head at all-</li>
            <li> I am so happy I finally found them!</li>
            <li> I forget I&#x27;m wearing them, they&#x27;re that comfortable.</li>
            <li> these are light and grip</li>
            <li> The curve doesn&#x27;t really fit to my head, feels like parts bulge out on the side.</li>
            <li> I loved the comfort of these headbands; however, the first one broke the first time I tried to slide it on my head.  </li>
            <li> They are tight a bit the other ziz zag ones of his are perfect, nice colors though, good value for the headbands.</li>
            <li> True, they don&#x27;t give you a headache, but they break easily.</li>
            <li> so I treated my first set preciously.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll happily keep buying them as long</li>
            <li> I really like these headbands, they are very comfortable.</li>
            <li> I have a rather large head and most plastic bands</li>
            <li> These are great, but also pretty fragile.</li>
            <li> They are true to advertising, no-headache headbands.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Second, the teeth on these is only on the sides, and is totally smooth on the top, so it does nothing to hold the hair on top in place at all.</li>
            <li> For the most part they aren&#x27;t even very noticeable.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The shape is perfect, at least for my head, and it doesn&#x27;t pinch.  </li>
            <li> Good price, arrived promptly, but a bit big for my head.</li>
            <li> they are not painful at all, and can be worn with sunglasses.</li>
            <li> These  were worth the cost to provide comfortable hair control without any headaches or head soreness.</li>
            <li> My hair is very fine, and everything normally slips off of my head...</li>
            <li> They really don&#x27;t fit right.  </li>
            <li> They are exactly what they are called-thin, but strong, and they don&#x27;t cause headaches.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re simple, unobtrusive and, most importantly, don&#x27;t give me pain!  </li>
            <li> Once I put these on the correct way, they did a super job of keeping my baby-fine hair out of my face.  </li>
            <li> My daughter will not wear regular headbands but she really needs them with her wild hair-these are perfect!</li>
            <li> For the price especially I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I have fine straight hair and these do the job of keeping my hair out of my face.</li>
            <li> think success with these may have to do with your type of hair.</li>
            <li> I do have a giant head, and I love these because they fit.  </li>
            <li> The ends tuck up in my hairline for a seamless look, love it.</li>
            <li> These are the only headbands that I have been able to find with the curved ends that allow one to wear glasses comfortably.</li>
            <li> These headbands are not an effective way to hold bangs back.</li>
            <li> Actually it did kind of make my head hurt</li>
            <li> Yes, it&#x27;s true that these are painless, but they also don&#x27;t hold back my rather abundant hair very well.</li>
            <li> They curve by the ear and don&#x27;t sit on your head right.</li>
            <li> Wearing one right now.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found them more comfortable to hold my hair back while doing yoga than the more traditional elastic wraps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Great for thin, fine hair.</li>
            <li> The good news is that they are not too tight.</li>
            <li> These are definitely much more comfortable than other headbands I&#x27;ve tried, and I don&#x27;t think they would cause headaches like others would.</li>
            <li> Many of Sassoon&#x27;s hair accessories fit women who have large brain cases, but be careful -- not all Sassoon items do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t get headaches with this style but there is still enough discomfort that I&#x27;m glad to take it off when no longer needed.</li>
            <li> within the first month 2 out of 3 broke for no reason</li>
            <li> My first set of three lasted 9 months</li>
            <li> look exactly like pictures here.  </li>
            <li> These work really well for me!  </li>
            <li> Wish I could get some different colors, but these will do in most cases.</li>
            <li> Really cute and the ONLY headbands that don&#x27;t give me a headache, even among those that are advertised as &amp;#34;no headache&amp;#34; (get your act together, Goody!).</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> It sits exactly where you put it and doesn&#x27;t slip.</li>
            <li> I wish they came in more colors or the option to get them all in the same color.</li>
            <li> These headbands are my second favorite headbands.  </li>
            <li> Great design &amp; style which really won&#x27;t give you any headaches, but it was just too big for me, just wish they sold them in a tad smaller size.</li>
            <li> I have to say these work pretty well for me.  </li>
            <li> I have never been able to tolerate regular head bands, they give me a headache.</li>
            <li> They have definitely changed how these&#x27;re made, and not for the better.</li>
            <li> Mine broke the first day I wore one.</li>
            <li> Does not last more than a week.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s kinda more for show than for actually, you know, holding hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also, they don&#x27;t show much at all!</li>
            <li> The straight headbands hurt after 10 minutes and stretchy headbands roll off my head right away.</li>
            <li> These are nice, I do forget that I have them on, they don&#x27;t pinch behind my ears like most.</li>
            <li> I dig the thinness of these, but with that comes the inevitable... they break so easily.</li>
            <li> I do have super thick hair, so it falls over the headband easily, however they are comfortable.</li>
            <li> I realize these are low priced, but didn&#x27;t expect that they would break so easily.</li>
            <li> The headbands are good to keep hair back but break very easily and still does hurt behind the ear.</li>
            <li> I HAVE A REALLY LARGE HEAD.</li>
            <li> I thought they&#x27;d only hold fine hair...</li>
            <li> It looks perfectly fine but doesn&#x27;t necessarily keep my hair in place.  </li>
            <li> Seriously no headaches!</li>
            <li> i have super thick hair, and these do a great job at holding my hair back.</li>
            <li> These headbands are classy looking enough for the office and are very comfortable to wear all day.  </li>
            <li> However, I prefer the zig-zag ones a little better because these are a bit loose and would be better if they were more snug (and my head is on the big side).</li>
            <li> They do seem a little flimsy at first, but if you are careful, they do the job beautifully.  </li>
            <li> These are thin which is great but also very flimsy.</li>
            <li> but they also don&#x27;t fit my head properly at all.</li>
            <li> They work very well for my hair style</li>
            <li> Gift that was appreciated.</li>
            <li> Very brittle plastic.  </li>
            <li> I thought headbands were comfortable enough</li>
            <li> but this is on a whole another level.</li>
            <li> These arrived fast.</li>
            <li> They were packaged securely but I only used each of them once because they all broke.</li>
            <li> This may be because they don&#x27;t fit my head properly, but I still now have to buy another headband that does the job for me.</li>
            <li> These are very breakable</li>
            <li> This is truly the only headband that is comfortable.</li>
            <li> I think you would have to have a giant head for these things to fit your correctly.  </li>
            <li> They really work for me.</li>
            <li> These really work.</li>
            <li> they are wide and make me look like I have horns on the top of my head.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t really stay put.</li>
            <li> These are very flexible-  their design seems to keep them off pressure points of the head stimulating pain.  </li>
            <li> I have a head like a high school football coach&#x27;s, so it&#x27;s important to me to look as feminine as possible.</li>
            <li> The beige color which looks orange in the image is actually a good color and blends quite well with dark blonde colored hair.</li>
            <li> The comfort and style are worth major points though</li>
            <li> but I must say that they are remarkable for how thin they are.</li>
            <li> But overall not bad.</li>
            <li> I wish they made them in a slightly wider headband, too, though, because these tend to get lost under my hair pretty easily.</li>
            <li> I love the versatility of getting 3 colors, blond, tortoise, and black.</li>
            <li> What a clever product.</li>
            <li> The headband does curl backward, but they still sit low on the head just above the top of the ear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t worn headbands since high school</li>
            <li> But if you&#x27;re careful, they&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
            <li> They are okay a little on the flimsy slide.  </li>
            <li> As noted in other reviews, they break easily, so I deduct one star.  </li>
            <li> They do break easily, I have learned to treat them very carefully.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t even been able to use it, turned out to be a waste of money.</li>
            <li> One of the headbands broke within a week of normal use.</li>
            <li> The other two seem fine.</li>
            <li> They are super thin, so they aren&#x27;t as stylish as I&#x27;d like, but I can deal with it.</li>
            <li> And by curve, I mean it&#x27;s like they are made to kind of wrap around the ear or something.</li>
            <li> and I am buying a new set today.</li>
            <li> They break much less easily, but they&#x27;re unusable as headbands.</li>
            <li> They pretty much break if you look at them too long.</li>
            <li> These are very flimsy and don&#x27;t really hold your hair back.  </li>
            <li> I can wear these pretty much all day long without pressure on my scalp.</li>
            <li> Though I can get significantly more time out of them than other styles before the pain begins, it inevitably shows up about 4 hours in.</li>
            <li> They haven&#x27;t so far though!</li>
            <li> Works a lot better than the traditional headbands, due to the shape of the &amp;#34;no headache&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t going to slide neatly into place unless I find myself some sandpaper and smooth down the edges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> True, the hairband is very light and does not &amp;#34;pinch.&amp;#34;  However, it does a poor job of keeping hair back too.  </li>
            <li> The style is simple and elegant, which I think could be worn by both men and women, and comes in three hair shades: black, blond, and brown.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that they are so thin and flexible  and don&#x27;t exactly match my head shape, so they don&#x27;t have the greatest hold in my hair.  </li>
            <li> These seemed like a good idea but were very thin and broke within a day of normal usage.</li>
            <li> They sit touching the top of my head and behind my ears, with the rest of the headband resting about a half an inch away from my scalp.  </li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t strong enough to actually hold my hair back, so when I put them on</li>
            <li> Some headbands claim to be headache-free, and while they are comfortable for the first hour, they often hurt eventually, especially in the area right behind my ears.</li>
            <li> That means you have to add it to a larger order totaling a certain amount</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t wear headbands at home for the simple reason I get headaches very easy.  </li>
            <li> I was suspicious at first, they appeared at first sight a little flimsy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re not made to fit really snug, or at least they didn&#x27;t on me</li>
            <li> I wish they had them in clear plastic.</li>
            <li> They firmly hold hair without constricting your head, so you could comfortably wear them all day.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I tried putting one of these headbands on about 20 times before I eventually just gave up and threw it in the trash because it&#x27;s far too flimsy to hold my hair in place for any length of time at all.</li>
            <li> i am an adult</li>
            <li> They are so lightweight and soft</li>
            <li> Of course this time I will not let my 3 year old get a hold of these.  </li>
            <li> obviously made from high quality materials!</li>
            <li> not so comfortable after a few minutes.</li>
            <li> I literally said, &amp;quot;nooo!&amp;quot; out loud.</li>
            <li> These are complete junk.</li>
            <li> Far too flimsy.</li>
            <li> These bands hold back hair very well and do not dig into the skin.</li>
            <li> no-headache - loved them, and so did my son, unfortunately.</li>
            <li> : I just ordered some more of these great headbands, and I&#x27;m disappointed to receive some that are softer, thinner, and generally less robust than the old ones.</li>
            <li> but I have thick, long hair &amp; I love them!  </li>
            <li> I really liked the design of them, folding back into your hairline instead of clamping down around the back of your ear, but that doesn&#x27;t really help when all of them snap in half at the barest hint of pressure.</li>
            <li> The headbands curve slightly over the ears, toward the back of the head, and they&#x27;re comfortable.</li>
            <li> Oddly shaped and really doesn&#x27;t do much for my hair...</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a small head by any means and these things were huge on me.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Lastly, the price is very affordable, so if you need them, don&#x27;t wait too long.  </li>
            <li> They fit my small head as well as any others I have found.</li>
            <li> The missing teeth also make it so that even though the bangs are pushed back, there isn&#x27;t a smooth look.</li>
            <li> These headbands did not fit my head- primarily because the ends curve back.</li>
            <li> I was so very hopeful, after the majority of previous reviews were so positive, that these would actually be headache-free headbands.</li>
            <li> The shape doesn&#x27;t work super well for actually holding your hair back, and is rather loose on the head.</li>
            <li> These probably would not hold back a heavy head of hair, but  if you have fine or thin hair you&#x27;ll love these.</li>
            <li> The arms of the headband curve back in a really smart way, so the headband sit flat against your head, instead of digging in to hold on.</li>
            <li> Only thing that could possibly make them better is if they could be made of a soft plastic instead of the hard plastic.</li>
            <li> I had a couple other VS headbands that my 3 year old snapped that really were</li>
            <li> However, I don&#x27;t understand how anyone can wear these with glasses without having to push the headband way back on the head until it nearly falls off.</li>
            <li> Love these thin headbands - all others would give me headaches.  </li>
            <li> I love the idea of a headband that doesn&#x27;t push against behind my ears</li>
            <li> only complaint is that they break relatively easily.</li>
            <li> I think because it lays up higher on my head and not where a typical headband lays.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re too soft and flexible to hold my hair in place -- and I have really fine, thin hair.</li>
            <li> If you have harder to manage hair or very curly hair, I don&#x27;t think these will hold it back.</li>
            <li> I do have a head that is more narrow than round.</li>
            <li> I have very thin straight hair, so the job should be relatively easy, but the headband can barely keep my hair back while moving about.  </li>
            <li> these headbands are so weak that they break easily.</li>
            <li> The only negative is that they are so thin &amp; light they break easily when traveling.</li>
            <li> Having been forewarned by other reviews, I patiently tried to gently position the second one.  </li>
            <li> but I really prefer to wear my hair down</li>
            <li> It hits the bone on the side of my head, behind the ears, and slips off fairly easily.</li>
            <li> but my hair isn&#x27;t super thick.</li>
            <li> These are pretty and comfortable, but they are a little thin</li>
            <li> The tips on these headbands are bent to the side so they won&#x27;t press on the bone behind my ear, sure, but that implies that they&#x27;d stay on my head long enough for that to matter.&lt;br</li>
            <li> They do not hold my hair and I have thin fine hair.</li>
            <li> It is plastic but feels soft and flexible and due that it sits flush on your head all the way around without leaving any space.</li>
            <li> I have bought these in the past and I haven&#x27;t been able to find them anywhere lately.</li>
            <li> It is true they are thin and my boyfriend said I have a big head so that probably didn&#x27;t help.</li>
            <li> Super thin, as if have thread holding your hair back.</li>
            <li> The hair just does what it wants and it&#x27;s not cute.</li>
            <li> I do like the curve away from the ears, which allows me to wear the unbroken one with my glasses, but it&#x27;s simply the illusion of holding the hair back as they are so loose</li>
            <li> My hair is getting fairly long, but the sides are not quite long enough to stay out of my face; this is why I need these temporarily.</li>
            <li> They are definitely loose enough since I don&#x27;t wear them.  </li>
            <li> I also found them to move around and sit loosely on my head, so these are definitely not going to work for exercising.</li>
            <li> Very cool design that is comfy, but the plastic is a little thin</li>
            <li> Very lightweight, I hardly know I&#x27;m wearing them.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I ALSO PUT SOME LONG COLORED STREAMERS.</li>
            <li> A complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> The only downside is they are so thin that they don&#x27;t hold my hair back very well.</li>
            <li> I guess it wouldn&#x27;t cause a headache, but it feels strange on my head.</li>
            <li> I have to open the up wide and you can hear it crack.</li>
            <li> have long, thick, straight hair.</li>
            <li> Very thin but think they will be fine.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re the ONLY ones that aren&#x27;t too tight &amp; don&#x27;t hit the back of me ears, causing headaches.</li>
            <li> I just received them, and I have already gone back and ordered two other sets.  </li>
            <li> The only reason that they are not number one is due to their width.  </li>
            <li> The other two that came in the pack met a similar fate, one when I was jogging on a summer day.</li>
            <li> I rarely wear glasses - only in very rainy or foggy driving conditions - but then I have to wear my glasses at an odd angle and over the headband sides which feels very uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> so these finally got me out of the bun and back into having my hair down!  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wear them very long at all.</li>
            <li> Too thin to really hold back hair.</li>
            <li> So many times head bands get uncomfortable after a few hours.</li>
            <li> and they&#x27;re not strong enough to hold back your hair and stop it from parting.</li>
            <li> Not worth sending back.</li>
            <li> maybe my head is smaller than average because when I put one of these in it was basically like draping a ribbon over my head; no hold whatsoever.</li>
            <li> Was barely able to hold back my hair granted I have really thick curly hair however useless for me</li>
            <li> so thin one broke the first time I wore it.</li>
            <li> They dont hurt your ears but they don&#x27;t come down close enough to ur head</li>
            <li> These particular 3 thin hairbands are the biggest I&#x27;ve found and will not stay even on MY big head in MY hair without \\&quot;product\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I complained to the Amazon and they sent me a new package...same thing.  </li>
            <li> The only thing bad I would have to say is they break easy.</li>
            <li> NOT TOO TIGHT BUT CAN STILL HOLD MY MOP BACK.</li>
            <li> The first one I tried on had a rough bit of plastic at the end, which scraped the soft skin behind my ear pretty badly as I put it on.</li>
            <li> I have thin, straight hair</li>
            <li> it broke after only a few wears.</li>
            <li> Not very comfy.</li>
            <li> so please be careful.  </li>
            <li> Does not really show and hold the hair in the wind</li>
            <li> Only a few teeth inside the band on the sides so it does not smooth back your hair.</li>
            <li> The headbands came in misshapen and as a result, did not fit properly.</li>
            <li> Because of the color selections and their thinness, they are not real noticeable .  </li>
            <li> I purchased these headbands because I got tired of dealing with the pressure you get behind the ears with most headbands.  </li>
            <li> Actually, I love these, but it is annoying that it is an &amp;#34;add on item&amp;#34; only.</li>
            <li> They seem to hold my hair decently but seem a bit thin on sturdiness.  </li>
            <li> And there&#x27;s very little on it to hold my hair back, so</li>
            <li> That said, I realize that as they age they may break as other reviews have indicated.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> These didn&#x27;t give me headaches like other headbands, but they all ended up SNAPPING</li>
            <li> I usually have to take it out and re-position it several times if I wear it all day.  </li>
            <li> I also wear them with glasses every day, and they don&#x27;t get in each other&#x27;s way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> No headache due to bein a little on the loose side</li>
            <li> /&gt;These are flexible and lightweight, but do not seem durable, so I&#x27;m very careful with them.</li>
            <li> SOME TIMES I WIND COLORED RIBBON OR THICK YARN AROUND THEM TO GIVE A DIFFERENT LOOK.</li>
            <li> This headband is super awkward.</li>
            <li> Being so thin, these are not durable nor do they actually hold my hair back.  </li>
            <li> These are above and beyond any other hard material headband.</li>
            <li> Contrary to other reviews which says that this set cannot withstand the sunlight and other heat generating instruments, this product is almost unbreakable!</li>
            <li> Hard to describe, but the don&#x27;t actually form to the head.  </li>
            <li> I got these hoping that I would finally get a hard headband that didn&#x27;t hurt my head.</li>
            <li> they cause the least discomfort possible.  </li>
            <li> would return but not worth the effort, cost</li>
            <li> My hair is a dark blond</li>
            <li> Therefore does not effectively  do anything for holding hair back.</li>
            <li> I have thick, curly, coarse hair and this headband</li>
            <li> These bands do not dig into your scalp or irritate the sensitive area behind your ears, or even fight your glasses for territory.</li>
            <li> Two down one to go</li>
            <li> Two down, one to go....</li>
            <li> I wish they were made of a less brittle and rigid plastic.</li>
            <li> I think I might just have an oddly shaped head.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a tan, black and brown.  </li>
            <li> I thoughtlessly grabbed it to untangle it from my shirt, and it snapped in half.</li>
            <li> It was worth a try, since they aren&#x27;t expensive, but these were a failure for me.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t get a sore pressure point behind your ears, you  barely know  you&#x27;re wearing it.</li>
            <li> cracked one already by overstretching it just a little.</li>
            <li> I thought these looked a little funky in the pic</li>
            <li> They are a little bit flimsy, however.  </li>
            <li> Maybe if they were a little thicker.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.  </li>
            <li> they are almost perfectly round</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> The design/shape of the ends is a great idea to eliminate pressure behind the ears after prolonged wear, but the band itself is just so darn thin and flimsy rendering this headband practically worthless.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Except one broke after a few months use.  </li>
            <li> I think because they don&#x27;t sit directly behind your ears-they curve back.</li>
            <li> /&gt;First of all, I have to slide the tips just over my ears to get them into the proper place so that my hair won&#x27;t escape the sides, but the plastic on these was so rough that I was afraid that if I tried to do that with these, I&#x27;d cut myself.</li>
            <li> What a waste!</li>
            <li> The point of a hairband for me is to be lazy and not have to style my hair.  </li>
            <li> These hurt me - I do have a small head though.</li>
            <li> They are small and unobtrusive.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s weird to me that the teeth are only on the sides.</li>
            <li> The blonde one felt uncomfortable the moment I put it on.</li>
            <li> or you are not able to buy them.</li>
            <li> I now put them inside a small box in my suitcase so they won&#x27;t break.</li>
            <li> Love headband s and hate headaches!</li>
            <li> I wear headbands every day to tame my thick and unruly curly hair.  </li>
            <li> Also, not shaped like a head unless  you are very, very  round headed.</li>
            <li> i think it my problem because they are not suitable for my head.</li>
            <li> Too thin and the first one I was using already snapped in half! :((</li>
            <li> I hate &#x27;breaking in&#x27; new headbands as that usually guarantees a headache for a few days; something I do NOT look forward to.  </li>
            <li> and I can hardly feel them there.</li>
            <li> ; I hardly realize I am wearing one.  </li>
            <li> I missed my headbands from the early 90&#x27;s but the only ones I could find lately gave me terrible headaches.  </li>
            <li> but these are really weird and hurt worse than regular ones.</li>
            <li> I continue my clumsy rampage of hair accessory</li>
            <li> I wore them only a few times and got frustrated because it didn&#x27;t keep my hair in place.</li>
            <li> I have had them for at least two months now and wear them every day, all day.</li>
            <li> I have curly thick hair, so I don&#x27;t even bother.</li>
            <li> I have medium to thick hair</li>
            <li> I discover in the future that these are easily broken, I will find it hard to be too mad.</li>
            <li> They stay in place and don&#x27;t give me a headache or sore spots behind my poor little ears.  </li>
            <li> Very hard to find them lately.</li>
            <li> Waste of money..why do people even bother to make these useless things.</li>
            <li> Therefore, I am now ordering another set to ensure I never have to go without... at least until my hairdo grows out!</li>
            <li> I guess since my hair isn&#x27;t very thick.</li>
            <li> Alas, that is not the case.</li>
            <li> Teeth were broken off during shipping.</li>
            <li> I got this product in July and every one of the bands has broken.  </li>
            <li> Piece of crap...too thin to hold your hair..</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t broken any yet, but</li>
            <li> Of the three in the set, one was broken in the package, and one broke while I was putting it on.</li>
            <li> I find it irritating to use.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re thin, but durable.</li>
            <li> Becuse of chemo I have  thin hair</li>
            <li> Poor quality and flimsy.</li>
            <li> These are Not for thick curly hair!!</li>
            <li> These curve behind my ear so they don&#x27;t put pressure on my head in any awkward places.</li>
            <li> Sorry, it does not work for my head.</li>
            <li> Uncomfortable anyhow.</li>
            <li> Sadly, they went in the trash.</li>
            <li> but unfortunately this product is not the solution.  </li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
            <li> zag design with combs at the earpieces -- unfortunately, they do not seem to be offered any longer.</li>
            <li> Flimsy and uncomfortable</li>
            <li> Very thin...</li>
            <li> Very thin so they aren&#x27;t a fashion statement.</li>
            <li> (My boyfriend, alarmed, came in to find me standing there with what was apparently a hilariously sad look on my face as I held the two halves in my palm, shocked.)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a ferocious headband wearer, so to find that these snapped after a couple of wears was disappointing.</li>
            <li> (they are curved up a bit, so it does not settle in that annoying spot directly behind your ears), but I have to say, these headbands do the trick</li>
            <li> I hate for headbands to sit on that bone behind my ear.</li>
            <li> Too bad.  </li>
            <li> However, it would look bad if I didn&#x27;t style it with these bands.</li>
            <li> I am growing out a pixie cut, and anyone who has been there knows, I need hair accessories badly.</li>
            <li> If I wear the headband for any length of time it does become quite painful.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed.</li>
            <li> This is a very awkward product for me</li>
            <li> These headbands are worthless.</li>
            <li> These are crap.</li>
            <li> Very bad quality.</li>
            <li> Just awful.</li>
            <li> These are awful.</li>
            <li> Awful.</li>
            <li> terrible terrible terrible</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Does the job! Keeps the hair out of my eyes and greatly reduces - though doesn&#x27;t totally eliminate - head discomfort. I always get headaches when wearing headbands. I don&#x27;t get headaches with this style but there is still enough discomfort that I&#x27;m glad to take it off when no longer needed. The lighter colored one made cracking sounds when I started wearing it and broke within about 8 wears. The other two seem fine.</li>
            <li> These are the best headbands I&#x27;ve ever used. The straight headbands hurt after 10 minutes and stretchy headbands roll off my head right away. These curve behind my ear so they don&#x27;t put pressure on my head in any awkward places. It&#x27;s an added bonus that they don&#x27;t interfere with wearing glasses or sunglasses!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think success with these may have to do with your type of hair. I have thin, straight hair and I just need to keep it out of my face or have a cute look with the added headband. If you have harder to manage hair or very curly hair, I don&#x27;t think these will hold it back.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t find them anywhere. They have always been my favorite headbands because they are so comfortable, that I do not know that they are there. And they don&#x27;t interfere with my glasses.</li>
            <li> Sorry, it does not work for my head. none of them. i think it my problem because they are not suitable for my head.</li>
            <li> within the first month 2 out of 3 broke for no reason</li>
            <li> NOT TOO TIGHT BUT CAN STILL HOLD MY MOP BACK. SOME TIMES I WIND COLORED RIBBON OR THICK YARN AROUND THEM TO GIVE A DIFFERENT LOOK. I ALSO PUT SOME LONG COLORED STREAMERS. THEY  LOOK CUTE HANGING ON A HOOK IN MY BATHROOM.</li>
            <li> i like. No headache due to bein a little on the loose side</li>
            <li> I dig the thinness of these, but with that comes the inevitable... they break so easily. I really liked the design of them, folding back into your hairline instead of clamping down around the back of your ear, but that doesn&#x27;t really help when all of them snap in half at the barest hint of pressure.</li>
            <li> used to make flower and rhinestone headbands for sister.  she loved it</li>
            <li> Super thin, as if have thread holding your hair back. I have curly thick hair, so I don&#x27;t even bother.</li>
            <li> They really don&#x27;t fit right.  Hard to describe, but the don&#x27;t actually form to the head.  They are definitely loose enough since I don&#x27;t wear them.  Not worth sending back.</li>
            <li> These headbands are wonderful. They are thin and comfortable. They stay put and do not pinch.</li>
            <li> These headbands fooled me.  I thought they&#x27;d only hold fine hair...but I have thick, long hair &amp; I love them!  Very lightweight, I hardly know I&#x27;m wearing them.&lt;br /&gt;Super!!!</li>
            <li> I do have a giant head, and I love these because they fit.  Because of the backwards curve at the end (why aren&#x27;t all plastic headbands made this way?) they cause the least discomfort possible.  As noted in other reviews, they break easily, so I deduct one star.  My first set of three lasted 9 months and I am buying a new set today.</li>
            <li> These didn&#x27;t give me a headache but they also don&#x27;t fit my head properly at all. They aren&#x27;t strong enough to actually hold my hair back, so when I put them on it&#x27;s just adding a piece of plastic to my head for no reason.</li>
            <li> A set of 3 very stylish and comfortable to wear head bands.  I have bought numerous kinds of headbands on Amazon and none satisfy me like these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They look exactly like pictures here.  The style is simple and elegant, which I think could be worn by both men and women, and comes in three hair shades: black, blond, and brown.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They&#x27;re lightweight, plastic, and bendable.  Bendable but somewhat easy to break.  One day, I accidentally exerted extra force and snap!  It broke.  They firmly hold hair without constricting your head, so you could comfortably wear them all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, the price is very affordable, so if you need them, don&#x27;t wait too long.  I have only used them for a week, so just 4 stars for now.  I will give 5 stars if they still perform well after some time.</li>
            <li> Nice. I HAVE A REALLY LARGE HEAD. plus I wear weaves and hair extensions.  This bands don&#x27;t hurt at all. I don&#x27;t even feel it&#x27;s on my head</li>
            <li> Very bad quality. each one lasted for some hours. They broke all, within 2 days!</li>
            <li> I cannot attest to the longevity of these headbands as I&#x27;ve only had a short while but I must say that they are remarkable for how thin they are. They work very well for my hair style and I can hardly feel them there. They feel remarkably resilient for their slimness in their new, unused condition. That said, I realize that as they age they may break as other reviews have indicated.&lt;br /&gt;I have difficulty with headbands. Most, even the so-called &amp;quot;ouchless&amp;quot; ones, give me a headache (maybe I have a big head, I don&#x27;t know)  And wearing a comfortable headband is headline news in my mind.&lt;br /&gt;If I discover in the future that these are easily broken, I will find it hard to be too mad. They are inexpensive and easily replaced here on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Would not recommend. They don&#x27;t stay on your head very good.</li>
            <li> Too thin and the first one I was using already snapped in half! :((</li>
            <li> These work really well for me!  They do break easily, I have learned to treat them very carefully.</li>
            <li> Gift that was appreciated.</li>
            <li> These are Not for thick curly hair!! I can&#x27;t even get them to stay!</li>
            <li> These didn&#x27;t give me headaches like other headbands, but they all ended up SNAPPING ON MY HEAD whitin a week as I was wearing them! I don&#x27;t have a big head or anything so this is rediculous! Very brittle plastic.  Such a shame coz they were comfortable.</li>
            <li> These only get a star so I can enter a review. Just awful. Wear them 2-3 times and they break apart. A complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> They are true to advertising, no-headache headbands.  They do seem a little flimsy at first, but if you are careful, they do the job beautifully.  Wish I could get some different colors, but these will do in most cases.</li>
            <li> Seriously no headaches! My daughter will not wear regular headbands but she really needs them with her wild hair-these are perfect!</li>
            <li> This is a very awkward product for me I guess since my hair isn&#x27;t very thick. It hits the bone on the side of my head, behind the ears, and slips off fairly easily. Haven&#x27;t even been able to use it, turned out to be a waste of money.</li>
            <li> These are thin which is great but also very flimsy. Broke after one use.</li>
            <li> The tips on these headbands are bent to the side so they won&#x27;t press on the bone behind my ear, sure, but that implies that they&#x27;d stay on my head long enough for that to matter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, I have to slide the tips just over my ears to get them into the proper place so that my hair won&#x27;t escape the sides, but the plastic on these was so rough that I was afraid that if I tried to do that with these, I&#x27;d cut myself. They aren&#x27;t going to slide neatly into place unless I find myself some sandpaper and smooth down the edges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, the teeth on these is only on the sides, and is totally smooth on the top, so it does nothing to hold the hair on top in place at all. I tried putting one of these headbands on about 20 times before I eventually just gave up and threw it in the trash because it&#x27;s far too flimsy to hold my hair in place for any length of time at all.</li>
            <li> most useless piece if c&amp;*% i ever owned. They do nothing that&#x27;s why they don&#x27;t give u a headache. They don&#x27;t hold at all.</li>
            <li> I was so very hopeful, after the majority of previous reviews were so positive, that these would actually be headache-free headbands. Alas, that is not the case. Though I can get significantly more time out of them than other styles before the pain begins, it inevitably shows up about 4 hours in. If I resituate it every 30 minutes or so, I can squeak the rest of the day out, but it&#x27;s so unpleasant.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s 2014! How do we not have truly painless headbands yet?</li>
            <li> True, they don&#x27;t give you a headache, but they break easily.</li>
            <li> I missed my headbands from the early 90&#x27;s but the only ones I could find lately gave me terrible headaches.  I can&#x27;t handle hair on my face so these finally got me out of the bun and back into having my hair down!  They&#x27;re simple, unobtrusive and, most importantly, don&#x27;t give me pain!  I love these and will buy many more.</li>
            <li> Great for thin, fine hair.</li>
            <li> These are my tween daughter&#x27;s favorite headbands. They&#x27;re nothing fancy to look at but they are the only ones she wears. The headbands curve slightly over the ears, toward the back of the head, and they&#x27;re comfortable. They stay in place in her fine hair.</li>
            <li> Never felt anything like this. I thought headbands were comfortable enough but this is on a whole another level.</li>
            <li> They hurt my ears and broke within a month. Cheap material.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.  The reason they don&#x27;t give you a headache is because they don&#x27;t work.  Kept falling out of my hair.  What a waste!</li>
            <li> I loved the comfort of these headbands; however, the first one broke the first time I tried to slide it on my head.  Having been forewarned by other reviews, I patiently tried to gently position the second one.  It lasted two days.  The third one lasted only one wearing.  Too bad.  They were very comfortable, before they broke.</li>
            <li> they should sell these by the hundreds.  no headache.  very comfortable to wear and just the right width.  i am an adult and i do not mishandle my accessories.  it broke after only a few wears.</li>
            <li> flimsy. cracked one already by overstretching it just a little. no pain. better than nothing. I use it while running on the treadmill and reading outside with the wind blowing.</li>
            <li> Was barely able to hold back my hair granted I have really thick curly hair however useless for me</li>
            <li> Really cute and the ONLY headbands that don&#x27;t give me a headache, even among those that are advertised as &amp;#34;no headache&amp;#34; (get your act together, Goody!). But they break REAAAAALLY easily. I wish they were made of a less brittle and rigid plastic.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t worn headbands since high school but I really prefer to wear my hair down and sometimes I just don&#x27;t want it in my face!  These headbands are classy looking enough for the office and are very comfortable to wear all day.  My only complaint is that they are so thin and flexible  and don&#x27;t exactly match my head shape, so they don&#x27;t have the greatest hold in my hair.  They sit touching the top of my head and behind my ears, with the rest of the headband resting about a half an inch away from my scalp.  It looks perfectly fine but doesn&#x27;t necessarily keep my hair in place.  I usually have to take it out and re-position it several times if I wear it all day.  The comfort and style are worth major points though so I would definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> OK.... Not as strong as I hoped</li>
            <li> Too thin to really hold back hair.</li>
            <li> Very thin...so thin one broke the first time I wore it. Also, not shaped like a head unless  you are very, very  round headed. Would not buy again.</li>
            <li> So many times head bands get uncomfortable after a few hours. I can wear these all day with no problem. I have fine straight hair and these do the job of keeping my hair out of my face. Very thin so they aren&#x27;t a fashion statement. For the most part they aren&#x27;t even very noticeable.  Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> Oddly shaped and really doesn&#x27;t do much for my hair... Definitely can&#x27;t not be used for curly hair people.</li>
            <li> I wear headbands every day to tame my thick and unruly curly hair.  I hate &#x27;breaking in&#x27; new headbands as that usually guarantees a headache for a few days; something I do NOT look forward to.  These headbands are awesome.  I just received them, and I have already gone back and ordered two other sets.  It took me a moment to figure out how to wear them (they are curved up a bit, so it does not settle in that annoying spot directly behind your ears), but I have to say, these headbands do the trick; I hardly realize I am wearing one.  You cannot argue with the price for the three of these, and I&#x27;ve not seen this style of headbands in any of the stores, even the big-box/supercenter ones.  Love these headbands!!!!!</li>
            <li> Break very easily. All 3 already broke after wearing them twice. This product deserve no star.</li>
            <li> These are brilliant at keeping my hair out of the way. They don&#x27;t dig into my head, which is awesome. They blend into my hair which is also excellent as I don&#x27;t like headbands that stand out too much.</li>
            <li> I thought these looked a little funky in the pic but they are designed so well. These are above and beyond any other hard material headband. It is plastic but feels soft and flexible and due that it sits flush on your head all the way around without leaving any space. It sits exactly where you put it and doesn&#x27;t slip. The ends curving make it sit where you put it and flexes to your head. They are so lightweight and soft you can&#x27;t even tell you&#x27;re wearing them. I just bout 2 more packs. I wish they came in more colors or the option to get them all in the same color.</li>
            <li> I can wear this headband for hours and forget its there.  The ends tuck up in my hairline for a seamless look, love it.</li>
            <li> Have already ordered my second set! Zero headaches! Also helpful for wearing with glasses.</li>
            <li> These arrived fast. They were packaged securely but I only used each of them once because they all broke. It is true they are thin and my boyfriend said I have a big head so that probably didn&#x27;t help.</li>
            <li> Broke within 1 hour of wearing. Nice that they don&#x27;t squeeze your head off though.</li>
            <li> I really like these headbands, they are very comfortable. Only thing that could possibly make them better is if they could be made of a soft plastic instead of the hard plastic.</li>
            <li> Lightweight and stays on and does not hurt the head.  Love them.</li>
            <li> Teeth were broken off during shipping. Uncomfortable anyhow.</li>
            <li> These headbands are worthless. They don&#x27;t hold hair back,they aren&#x27;t even decorative. I DO NOT recommend.</li>
            <li> These headbands are my second favorite headbands.  The only reason that they are not number one is due to their width.  They are awesome.  They DO NOT give me a a headache.  I have thick, curly, coarse hair and this headband works perfectly.</li>
            <li> Not very comfy. I think I might just have an oddly shaped head. Still on the search for headbands that don&#x27;t hurt as I love headbands</li>
            <li> This headband is super awkward. I&#x27;m not even sure how I&#x27;m supposed to put it on with the bend on the bottom of the hairband. I don&#x27;t recommend it at all.</li>
            <li> True, the hairband is very light and does not &amp;#34;pinch.&amp;#34;  However, it does a poor job of keeping hair back too.  I have very thin straight hair, so the job should be relatively easy, but the headband can barely keep my hair back while moving about.  Also, when it does keep my hair back, my hair just does not look very good.  The point of a hairband for me is to be lazy and not have to style my hair.  However, it would look bad if I didn&#x27;t style it with these bands.</li>
            <li> These are nice, I do forget that I have them on, they don&#x27;t pinch behind my ears like most. The only downside is they are so thin that they don&#x27;t hold my hair back very well. I do have super thick hair, so it falls over the headband easily, however they are comfortable.</li>
            <li> I got this product in July and every one of the bands has broken.  I wouldn&#x27;t advise anyone to buy this product.  I feel ripped off.</li>
            <li> They pretty much break if you look at them too long.</li>
            <li> I love these hair bands and have been looking for them everywhere. They are great for anyone who has a sensitive head. The only thing bad I would have to say is they break easy. But for me I just ordered plenty so I have backups. Such a great product!</li>
            <li> Great  no headaches, have been looking for something like this for a while.  Wear a headset at work and these don&#x27;t interfere</li>
            <li> I had a couple other VS headbands that my 3 year old snapped that really were no-headache - loved them, and so did my son, unfortunately. So I bought these thinking they would do the same. These hurt me - I do have a small head though. Sadly, they went in the trash.</li>
            <li> I was suspicious at first, they appeared at first sight a little flimsy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once I slipt one on, I was hooked.  I have medium to thick hair and it holds it in place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found them more comfortable to hold my hair back while doing yoga than the more traditional elastic wraps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shape is perfect, at least for my head, and it doesn&#x27;t pinch.  I do have a head that is more narrow than round.</li>
            <li> Good price, arrived promptly, but a bit big for my head. Also the no headache description isn&#x27;t accurate for me. If I wear the headband for any length of time it does become quite painful. This may be because they don&#x27;t fit my head properly, but I still now have to buy another headband that does the job for me.</li>
            <li> Piece of crap...too thin to hold your hair.. Waste of money..why do people even bother to make these useless things.</li>
            <li> these headbands are so weak that they break easily. good idea though</li>
            <li> Very thin but think they will be fine.</li>
            <li> Love these thin headbands - all others would give me headaches.  They do break, but for the price, it is what it is.  I try to stock up to have extras just in case!</li>
            <li> These work great with wearing glasses, and are very lightweight and don&#x27;t hurt my head. The downside is, the thinness also makes them prone to breakage. Also tend to be a bit slippy, which I was able to fix using stick-on strips called Silly Grip--this doesn&#x27;t appear to be available via Amazon, but I did find it on Etsy.</li>
            <li> The reason I got these was because some headbands dig into my head but these are really weird and hurt worse than regular ones.</li>
            <li> They dont hurt your ears but they don&#x27;t come down close enough to ur head so it bearly touches my hair and doesn&#x27;t keep my bangs away from my face...which was the reason I wanted them.</li>
            <li> Very comfortable, but they can slip a bit more than others.  Still like them though.  Good for use with fine hair.</li>
            <li> Love these headbands, never give me a headache</li>
            <li> These headbands fit perfect and no headaches.  My hair is out of my face.  Of course this time I will not let my 3 year old get a hold of these.  I bough Vidal Sassoon headbands before and he broke them.  These are very breakable so please be careful.  I would definitely recommend these headbands for purchase.</li>
            <li> This is the only headband that I&#x27;ve found that is actually ouchless.  I love them and for a while couldn&#x27;t find them again so I treated my first set preciously.  Please don&#x27;t let them go away again!</li>
            <li> These are the only headbands that I have been able to find with the curved ends that allow one to wear glasses comfortably. They are comfortable, flexible, and I wish like all get out that I could find more of this design in a wider range of colors</li>
            <li> These didn&#x27;t work well for me.</li>
            <li> These are definitely much more comfortable than other headbands I&#x27;ve tried, and I don&#x27;t think they would cause headaches like others would. I wish they made them in a slightly wider headband, too, though, because these tend to get lost under my hair pretty easily. Still cute, though!</li>
            <li> They do not give you a headace and I love them</li>
            <li> Does not really show and hold the hair in the wind</li>
            <li> Bought this set three times. That is how often I use it and how much I love it.</li>
            <li> These are very nice headbands. I love the versatility of getting 3 colors, blond, tortoise, and black. These are very comfortable, and have teeth to hold your hair also. They were delivered very quickly.</li>
            <li> I like these bands. They fit my small head as well as any others I have found. They are small and unobtrusive. Good for when you just want to keep your hair out of your face and are not looking to make a fashion statement. Good value for the price.</li>
            <li> I have a big square head and cannot find anything that fits. These are great! No pain and they are cute!</li>
            <li> Contrary to other reviews which says that this set cannot withstand the sunlight and other heat generating instruments, this product is almost unbreakable! obviously made from high quality materials!</li>
            <li> I am growing out a pixie cut, and anyone who has been there knows, I need hair accessories badly. Barrettes make me look like I&#x27;m trying to be a teenager, so a headband is my only option, and I have tried them all. Some headbands claim to be headache-free, and while they are comfortable for the first hour, they often hurt eventually, especially in the area right behind my ears. These stay comfortable all day: I am a teacher, and I put one in at 6 am and often don&#x27;t get home until 5 or 6 pm. That&#x27;s 12 hours with no pain. Two drawbacks? They are super thin, so they aren&#x27;t as stylish as I&#x27;d like, but I can deal with it. Second, they are very fragile. I haven&#x27;t broken any yet, but I know it&#x27;s just a matter of time. Therefore, I am now ordering another set to ensure I never have to go without... at least until my hairdo grows out!</li>
            <li> I love the idea of a headband that doesn&#x27;t push against behind my ears but unfortunately this product is not the solution.  I wore one to the beach and within the hour the material became sticky and melted.  I took it off and it snapped in two.  The other two that came in the pack met a similar fate, one when I was jogging on a summer day.</li>
            <li> I love the no headache design of the Vidal Sassoon headbands.  These are simple and tasteful for all-occasion wear.  However, I prefer the zig-zag ones a little better because these are a bit loose and would be better if they were more snug (and my head is on the big side).</li>
            <li> Great design &amp; style which really won&#x27;t give you any headaches, but it was just too big for me, just wish they sold them in a tad smaller size.</li>
            <li> They are tight a bit the other ziz zag ones of his are perfect, nice colors though, good value for the headbands.</li>
            <li> not so comfortable after a few minutes. pushes in on side of head. would return but not worth the effort, cost</li>
            <li> They work fine, can wear one all day with out a head ache. The shape doesn&#x27;t work super well for actually holding your hair back, and is rather loose on the head. Good for the price.</li>
            <li> Excellent  product and service</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s weird to me that the teeth are only on the sides. These headbands are not an effective way to hold bangs back. The missing teeth also make it so that even though the bangs are pushed back, there isn&#x27;t a smooth look. The hair just does what it wants and it&#x27;s not cute. I also found them to move around and sit loosely on my head, so these are definitely not going to work for exercising.</li>
            <li> Of the three in the set, one was broken in the package, and one broke while I was putting it on. I do like the curve away from the ears, which allows me to wear the unbroken one with my glasses, but it&#x27;s simply the illusion of holding the hair back as they are so loose there&#x27;s not enough tension to actually accomplish anything.</li>
            <li> I purchased these headbands because I got tired of dealing with the pressure you get behind the ears with most headbands.  I have to say these work pretty well for me.  The reason for 4 stars is because they advertise a white and there is no white.  They need to change that in the description.  There&#x27;s a tan, black and brown.  I complained to the Amazon and they sent me a new package...same thing.  Just be forewarned...there&#x27;s NO white!</li>
            <li> These headbands came in a three pack and two of the three were GREAT. I have never been able to wear a headband for any length of time because of the headache I would get from the pressure on my temples. These work differently. Instead of putting pressure on your temple the specially designed band works by very lightly hugging the contours of your skull. That&#x27;s what the curled ends are for. I was able to wear the darker head bands all day with no headache. The only reason I didn&#x27;t give this product 5 stars is that there is a difference among the bands depending on the color. The blonde one felt uncomfortable the moment I put it on. (The materials that are used to color plastics can affect the properties of the plastic.) My hair is a dark blond so the others work fine.</li>
            <li> This is truly the only headband that is comfortable. You don&#x27;t even know you have it on.  I&#x27;ve tried many brands that claim comfort, but these are the ones to get. I wish they could make them more fashionable. Buy them! You won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
            <li> These are awful. They curve by the ear and don&#x27;t sit on your head right. And by curve, I mean it&#x27;s like they are made to kind of wrap around the ear or something. Awful.</li>
            <li> They do not hold my hair and I have thin fine hair.</li>
            <li> I love these headbands!  They stay in place and don&#x27;t give me a headache or sore spots behind my poor little ears.  What an ingenious design!</li>
            <li> I got these hoping that I would finally get a hard headband that didn&#x27;t hurt my head. At first I thought it was perfect since it was so light weight and bent around the back of my head. After about 6 hours wearing it though I started to feel the pain and I had to keep moving it around. They are cute and very light weight but I still get a headache if I wear it all day.</li>
            <li> I know that it isn&#x27;t quite what it was intended for, but I love that I can wear this with my sunglasses! I&#x27;ve also never had a headache wearing them.</li>
            <li> These seemed like a good idea but were very thin and broke within a day of normal usage.</li>
            <li> Being so thin, these are not durable nor do they actually hold my hair back.  Also they don&#x27;t fit my head at all- they are almost perfectly round and my head is longer.  It was worth a try, since they aren&#x27;t expensive, but these were a failure for me.</li>
            <li> These seem well made. However I do not like the bend part over the ear. It goes over the top of your ear and then up the side of your head. Therefore does not effectively  do anything for holding hair back. I find it irritating to use. Actually it did kind of make my head hurt I think because it lays up higher on my head and not where a typical headband lays. I threw them out.</li>
            <li> I think you would have to have a giant head for these things to fit your correctly.  I don&#x27;t have a small head by any means and these things were huge on me.  I did not like the way the bottom flared out at all.  I ended up giving them to a friend on the chance that she would like them, she doesn&#x27;t like them either.  Waste of money.</li>
            <li> I wore the headband all day and did not get a headache.  I usually don&#x27;t wear headbands at home for the simple reason I get headaches very easy.  I put one of these on when they arrived and did not take it off until I went to bed.  I almost forgot I had it on.  The price has gone up since I bought mine, but I still am thinking of buying two more sets.  One as a backup for me and one for my grandchild.</li>
            <li> This style of headband is the only type that doesn&#x27;t give me headaches. Very hard to find them lately.</li>
            <li> I have bought these in the past and I haven&#x27;t been able to find them anywhere lately. I am so glad you posted them on Amazon. They really work for me. I hate for headbands to sit on that bone behind my ear. I can&#x27;t wear them very long at all. These curve to the back so they don&#x27;t rest on the bone. I have always like them and I use to get them at a chain store. Maybe I should get another set because I don&#x27;t want to be in that predicament again. I am so happy I finally found them! Thank you</li>
            <li> These really work. I have never been able to tolerate regular head bands, they give me a headache.</li>
            <li> These things are really great. I forget I&#x27;m wearing them, they&#x27;re that comfortable. The arms of the headband curve back in a really smart way, so the headband sit flat against your head, instead of digging in to hold on. Think when you perch glasses on the top of your head -- they work a lot like that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wear them when I work out, and they don&#x27;t budge. I also wear them with glasses every day, and they don&#x27;t get in each other&#x27;s way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that they break relatively easily. I forgot that I had one on last night as I pulled a shirt on over my head, and the shirt pulled it back and off my head. I thoughtlessly grabbed it to untangle it from my shirt, and it snapped in half. I literally said, &amp;quot;nooo!&amp;quot; out loud. (My boyfriend, alarmed, came in to find me standing there with what was apparently a hilariously sad look on my face as I held the two halves in my palm, shocked.) I broke another one a while ago when I pulled its ends apart too enthusiastically. Whoops. It seems like they could so easily be made stronger, but I guess they&#x27;re so cheap and light this way -- and I&#x27;m sure planned obsolescence plays a role, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But whatever, they&#x27;re barely more than a buck apiece, and they work fabulously. I&#x27;ll happily keep buying them as long I continue my clumsy rampage of hair accessory destruction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE, FEB 2015: I just ordered some more of these great headbands, and I&#x27;m disappointed to receive some that are softer, thinner, and generally less robust than the old ones. The first one I tried on had a rough bit of plastic at the end, which scraped the soft skin behind my ear pretty badly as I put it on. They have definitely changed how these&#x27;re made, and not for the better. I&#x27;m disappointed. They&#x27;re too soft and flexible to hold my hair in place -- and I have really fine, thin hair. They break much less easily, but they&#x27;re unusable as headbands.</li>
            <li> Very comfortable, just as advertised, thank you.</li>
            <li> they are wide and make me look like I have horns on the top of my head. Not a fan</li>
            <li> Perfect. Not one headache yet.</li>
            <li> These are very flimsy and don&#x27;t really hold your hair back.  The design/shape of the ends is a great idea to eliminate pressure behind the ears after prolonged wear, but the band itself is just so darn thin and flimsy rendering this headband practically worthless.</li>
            <li> These don&#x27;t stay in place well and they&#x27;re not strong enough to hold back your hair and stop it from parting. Add to that the fact that they don&#x27;t sit well when I wear my glasses and you have buyers remorse.</li>
            <li> Mine broke the first day I wore one. These are complete junk.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t really stay put. I wore them only a few times and got frustrated because it didn&#x27;t keep my hair in place.</li>
            <li> I have had them for at least two months now and wear them every day, all day. I do not feel the headband at all when I am wearing it. I wish they had them in more colors because I would for sure buy them too.</li>
            <li> Too comfortable, even for a girl with glasses!</li>
            <li> I love these.  They stay on my head and don&#x27;t slip off.  I can&#x27;t even tell I have it on.  My hair is very fine, and everything normally slips off of my head...These don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Very cool design that is comfy, but the plastic is a little thin so they break easily.  But if you&#x27;re careful, they&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
            <li> Perfect fit for an adult head, with no headaches!</li>
            <li> I love this band. I&#x27;ve never seen this style before but it works. You don&#x27;t get a sore pressure point behind your ears, you  barely know  you&#x27;re wearing it. What a clever product. It&#x27;s a keeper.</li>
            <li> Nothing fancy.  They seem to hold my hair decently but seem a bit thin on sturdiness.  The bend at the end is great, doesn&#x27;t poke my head.</li>
            <li> These are pretty and comfortable, but they are a little thin so I&#x27;m always worried that they&#x27;ll break. They haven&#x27;t so far though!</li>
            <li> I needed some cute head bands and I love these for so many reasons. They&#x27;re thin, but durable. Great buy.</li>
            <li> I have a big head. I have a head like a high school football coach&#x27;s, so it&#x27;s important to me to look as feminine as possible. These bands do not dig into your scalp or irritate the sensitive area behind your ears, or even fight your glasses for territory. Many of Sassoon&#x27;s hair accessories fit women who have large brain cases, but be careful -- not all Sassoon items do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An addendum: These particular 3 thin hairbands are the biggest I&#x27;ve found and will not stay even on MY big head in MY hair without \\&quot;product\\&quot; (mousse or spray) in my hair. The very best Vidal Sassoon headbands were a 2-pack, thicker plastic, zig-zag design with combs at the earpieces -- unfortunately, they do not seem to be offered any longer. Absolutely, THEY were the best, and I&#x27;d love to order more of them, as I managed to break one of mine.  I will keep  trying Sassoon hair accessories and reviewing them.</li>
            <li> I realize these are low priced, but didn&#x27;t expect that they would break so easily. Two down one to go</li>
            <li> I bought these for my Granddaughter for Christmas and she loved them.</li>
            <li> these are great! i have super thick hair, and these do a great job at holding my hair back. they are not painful at all, and can be worn with sunglasses. 5 stars.</li>
            <li> Yes, they work well, and don&#x27;t give me headaches. The color variety matches my variety of clothing. Would buy again.</li>
            <li> I prefer the memory foam headbands by this brand, which are excellent for fine/thin hair, whether your hair is straight or wavy.</li>
            <li> these are light and grip well. One has snapped within 2 months but I still think these are better than others as they are comfortable.</li>
            <li> Becuse of chemo I have  thin hair and it doesn&#x27;t hold anything back, just keeps sliding forward every time you move. Thin, cheap plastic.</li>
            <li> I bought 2 of this set. Don&#x27;t waste your money. Does not last more than a week. terrible terrible terrible</li>
            <li> I guess it wouldn&#x27;t cause a headache, but it feels strange on my head. The curve doesn&#x27;t really fit to my head, feels like parts bulge out on the side. And there&#x27;s very little on it to hold my hair back, so it&#x27;s kinda more for show than for actually, you know, holding hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Somebody said something about the thing being bendable, and yeah, it&#x27;s flexible, but it doesn&#x27;t hold a shape when bent, so that flexibility may translate into durability but not versatility.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have long, thick, straight hair. I am not in love with this product.</li>
            <li> They are okay a little on the flimsy slide.  But maybe my head is too big I have to open the up wide and you can hear it crack.</li>
            <li> I snapped these like crackers. They wear great and are comfortable while I&#x27;m wearing them. I&#x27;m not a ferocious headband wearer, so to find that these snapped after a couple of wears was disappointing. Two down, one to go....</li>
            <li> Flimsy and uncomfortable</li>
            <li> maybe my head is smaller than average because when I put one of these in it was basically like draping a ribbon over my head; no hold whatsoever. I threw them out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad to have these that don&#x27;t pinch my head.  They are a little bit flimsy, however.  Maybe if they were a little thicker.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t hurt! For it for my grandmother she loves it.  Except one broke after a few months use.  She use to wear head band for years and it won&#x27;t break.  Good thing the are 3</li>
            <li> Actually, I love these, but it is annoying that it is an &amp;#34;add on item&amp;#34; only. That means you have to add it to a larger order totaling a certain amount or you are not able to buy them. Otherwise would be 5 stars.</li>
            <li> My elderly mother needs a headband to keep her hair out of her eyes.  She was always complaining that they gave her headaches, so I bought these.  She loves them.  She says that keep her hair in place with no headaches.  These are more than a good product, they are a blessing.</li>
            <li> Only a few teeth inside the band on the sides so it does not smooth back your hair. Flimsy junk, don&#x27;t bother.</li>
            <li> Far too flimsy. The headbands came in misshapen and as a result, did not fit properly.</li>
            <li> These are so light weight and wonderful. I always get headaches from headbands, but since I have been using these ones there is no pressure on my head. Wonderful! I will be buying more!!!</li>
            <li> very very comfortable</li>
            <li> Yes, these are very light. It makes them perfect for my fine hair. These probably would not hold back a heavy head of hair, but  if you have fine or thin hair you&#x27;ll love these. I forget I even have one on! Also, they don&#x27;t show much at all!</li>
            <li> Yes, it&#x27;s true that these are painless, but they also don&#x27;t hold back my rather abundant hair very well. I guess that is the trade off. Perhaps they will work for someone with thinner hair than mine.</li>
            <li> These headbands did not fit my head- primarily because the ends curve back. The good news is that they are not too tight.</li>
            <li> Once I put these on the correct way, they did a super job of keeping my baby-fine hair out of my face.  I have a rather large head and most plastic bands give me a headache - not these.  Wish they also came in wider and patterned styles.</li>
            <li> I love these headbands. I can wear these pretty much all day long without pressure on my scalp. The only negative is that they are so thin &amp; light they break easily when traveling. I now put them inside a small box in my suitcase so they won&#x27;t break.</li>
            <li> Works great for keeping my hair out of my face while not giving me a headache.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t believe there was such a thing as a headband that didn&#x27;t give a headache, but I figured I would try this anyways cause I want to believe that it is possible. I will confirm for myself on my head that these indeed did not give me a headache! The beige color which looks orange in the image is actually a good color and blends quite well with dark blonde colored hair.</li>
            <li> These are great headbands.  They do not pinch or rub against my glasses.</li>
            <li> These bands hold back hair very well and do not dig into the skin. I am able to wear them with my glasses and work an 8 hour shift. Very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> These are crap. Won&#x27;t stay on my head at all.</li>
            <li> Awesome. Love headband s and hate headaches!</li>
            <li> They are really thin and comfortable. No headache, so to speak! I love it and will buy again if I lose them all 3.</li>
            <li> These are very flexible-  their design seems to keep them off pressure points of the head stimulating pain.  I did not get headaches while wearing these which was a very impressive for me.  Because of the color selections and their thinness, they are not real noticeable .  I would buy them again.</li>
            <li> Wearing one right now.  Works a lot better than the traditional headbands, due to the shape of the &amp;#34;no headache&amp;#34; band.  I would recommend it 10/10 times.</li>
            <li> These are great, but also pretty fragile.</li>
            <li> These are nice, and work well without causing headache or sore head from pressure of the band on it. However, I don&#x27;t understand how anyone can wear these with glasses without having to push the headband way back on the head until it nearly falls off. I rarely wear glasses - only in very rainy or foggy driving conditions - but then I have to wear my glasses at an odd angle and over the headband sides which feels very uncomfortable. The headband does curl backward, but they still sit low on the head just above the top of the ear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are flexible and lightweight, but do not seem durable, so I&#x27;m very careful with them. These  were worth the cost to provide comfortable hair control without any headaches or head soreness. My hair is getting fairly long, but the sides are not quite long enough to stay out of my face; this is why I need these temporarily. I wish they had them in clear plastic.</li>
            <li> The headbands are good to keep hair back but break very easily and still does hurt behind the ear. But overall not bad.</li>
            <li> I love these headbands!  They&#x27;re the ONLY ones that aren&#x27;t too tight &amp; don&#x27;t hit the back of me ears, causing headaches.</li>
            <li> Poor quality and flimsy. One of the headbands broke within a week of normal use.</li>
            <li> They are exactly what they are called-thin, but strong, and they don&#x27;t cause headaches. I think because they don&#x27;t sit directly behind your ears-they curve back. They&#x27;re not made to fit really snug, or at least they didn&#x27;t on me but my hair isn&#x27;t super thick. For the price especially I highly recommend.</li>
