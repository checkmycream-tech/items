            <li>:) I will definitely be purchasing more poo-pourri!</li>

            <li>the Santa Poo-pourri fills the air with a spicy, sweet smell; almost like Christmas cookies.</li>
            <li>Love this product, whole family uses it now.</li>
            <li>To name a couple from a very short list, I love Mr. Clean Magic Eraser and a product called Antique Furniture Restorer.  </li>
            <li>It works great, but so would spraying Pledge in your toilet and Pledge is much cheaper!</li>
            <li>Not only does it cover the poo smell when you go, but your toilet smells wonderful the rest of the day.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth buying because it does what it claims...</li>
            <li>It is a fun product that does all that it promises.</li>
            <li>This was a fun gift that got laughs at Christmas…yet is a product that really works!</li>
            <li>this works exactly as described.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty much just Pledge furniture polish!</li>
            <li>This stuff really works!</li>
            <li>Ive recently found this product but with a more lemon scent and use that also.</li>
            <li>I can wreck a bathroom, so I really appreciate the cover-up!  </li>
            <li>It really, really works!  </li>
            <li>Poo-pourri is at the top of my short list of products that really work the way the manufacturer says it will.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve just ordered her a refillable sprayer for her purse and a large refill size.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve even bought it for my kids and grands as one of their little Christmas gifts because I wanted them to try it and knew they wouldn&#x27;t buy it on their own.  </li>
            <li>Received a gift of this product for Christmas - looked it so much we ordered another two bottles for ourselves.</li>
            <li>you should really try it</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Thanks Santa.</li>
            <li>just a very strong citrus small to it.</li>
            <li>Since my chair sits right outside the bathroom door</li>
            <li>When I first saw the commercial online for Poo-Pourri</li>
            <li>Easy to use, just spray on the water&#x27;s surface in the bowl and odors are effectively trapped.</li>
            <li>It blocks all the unpleasant smells, and the smell of the product does linger but it smells good!</li>
            <li>As my 3 yr old granddaughter said &amp;#34;you shake it</li>
            <li>Very effective at covering unpleasant smells in the bathroom.</li>
            <li>There are only a few products that I&#x27;ve ever gotten really excited about, but this is one.  </li>

            <li> Waste of money!</li>
            <li> and it is usually 4 to 6 of them at a time.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with this one.</li>
            <li> It is expensive compared to the cover-up fragrances, but there is no comparison.  </li>
            <li> I will throw away as the smell is very annoying.</li>

            <li> I am very private about my bathroom habits. Don&#x27;t like pooping at work, and don&#x27;t like pooping when I have company. This actually works. When I&#x27;m done with my business, the bathroom smells better than before I started.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works! As my 3 yr old granddaughter said &amp;#34;you shake it, you spray it 4 times, you poo, and it smells like Christmas&amp;#34;!</li>
            <li> When I first saw the commercial online for Poo-Pourri I thought it was a joke. If you haven&#x27;t seen it watch it. The Poo-pourri works just like it says and it arrived in 2 days, excellent experience</li>
            <li> Great for guest bathrooms. Eliminates odors immediately.</li>
            <li> Good product.. and funny!</li>
            <li> I liked the fragrance, but my husband did not. He did admit that it is better than the poo smell.</li>
            <li> this is the best bathroom air freshener better than candles room spray you name it. i will continue to purchase it the guess love it no embarrassment.</li>
            <li> Since my chair sits right outside the bathroom door this has been a life (or breath) saver! Ive recently found this product but with a more lemon scent and use that also. Time to order more. A little goes a long way so it lasts forever.</li>
            <li> This item smells like Vicks vapor rub.  It permeated my entire house.  I will throw away as the smell is very annoying.</li>
            <li> By far this scent is my favorite and works the best!</li>
            <li> Been giving it as Christmas Gifts for years now!  Everyone loves them!!</li>
            <li> I have relatives that do a lot of traveling in a motor home and it is usually 4 to 6 of them at a time. So you can imagine what a great idea this is for them.</li>
            <li> This hides the smell, but all of these smell so similar. Even tried adding other oils to hide the &amp;#34;standard&amp;#34; aroma of poo-pouri.</li>
            <li> Works just like it claims, so I am happy.  I did find that that spray fragrance is strong and it does linger, so be forewarned, but it is way better than the alternative!  Good product, will purchase again.</li>
            <li> Hard to write a review about such an intimate product, All I will say is it works.  We will buy again.</li>
            <li> Great price. Great product. Fast shipping. Instantly masks poo smell. Great for when you have company or are on a date.</li>
            <li> As one other customer put it, &amp;#34;there&#x27;s no poo smell.&amp;#34;  I can wreck a bathroom, so I really appreciate the cover-up!  Thanks Santa.</li>
            <li> Love this product, whole family uses it now. Don&#x27;t have to breath in air fresheners that you spray to cover odors.</li>
            <li> I got this for my office bathroom. Wrote a informative note over the toliet. Heard giggling from bathroom and then employees talking about how great it worked. Happy office!</li>
            <li> It really, really works!  I have it at work, and in every bathroom in my home. It is a fun product that does all that it promises.</li>
            <li> This is a great product!  There are only a few products that I&#x27;ve ever gotten really excited about, but this is one.  To name a couple from a very short list, I love Mr. Clean Magic Eraser and a product called Antique Furniture Restorer.  Poo-pourri is at the top of my short list of products that really work the way the manufacturer says it will.  It is expensive compared to the cover-up fragrances, but there is no comparison.  This stuff works!  I&#x27;ve even bought it for my kids and grands as one of their little Christmas gifts because I wanted them to try it and knew they wouldn&#x27;t buy it on their own.  Now they are sold.  One of my granddaughters who is in college, even &amp;#34;borrowed&amp;#34; her mother&#x27;s bottle to take with her in her purse when she is away from her dorm room.  I&#x27;ve just ordered her a refillable sprayer for her purse and a large refill size.  I&#x27;ve liked all the fragrances I&#x27;ve tried.  Just shop around for the best price.</li>
