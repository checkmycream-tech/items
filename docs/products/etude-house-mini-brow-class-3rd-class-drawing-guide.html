            <li>I really like the fact that there are three different types of brow shapes that you can choose from!</li>
            <li>face is not big, it is just very wired with drawing using this brow class</li>

            <li> This is not what I requested.  I requested for brand Etude House, but I received some brand called Fangzhi.</li>
            <li> After using it, my brows are too short to be looked. But the shapes are good.&lt;br /&gt;My face is not big, it is just very wired with drawing using this brow class</li>

            <li> These were the perfect length for the shape of my brows.  I&#x27;m still needing brow guides that will have the thinner shaped styles.  I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I love to use these stencils with an eye brow powder.  Works beautifully.</li>
