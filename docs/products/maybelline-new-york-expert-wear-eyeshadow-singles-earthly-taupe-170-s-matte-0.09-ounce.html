            <li>Awesome!</li>
            <li>Very happy!</li>
            <li>I would think this would be best for a medium skin toned person.</li>
            <li>It looks great.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s almost like a foundation and a great camouflage.</li>
            <li>Works great for me.</li>
            <li>And I love the matte finish (which I need at my age, lol!).  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m fair and this color is a great neutral for my skin tone and age of 40 something.</li>
            <li>This color is really good.</li>
            <li>And the best part is that it&#x27;s really cheap, so</li>
            <li>good quality of makeup.</li>
            <li>It is not for a truly fair skinned person.</li>
            <li>It matches my skin tone fairly well and covers my eyelid veins.</li>
            <li>The Amazon price is good and with Prime shipping it is a good deal.</li>
            <li>and it is good for someone who does not wear a lot of makeup.</li>
            <li>My favorite for years!</li>
            <li>It might pop more on another person&#x27;s skin tone, but, for me, it&#x27;s just a good neutral.</li>
            <li>It matches my skin tone flawlessly and gives me a natural look.  </li>
            <li>This has always been one of my favorite products and I love the choice in colors.  </li>
            <li>This is the perfect color for blue eyes.  </li>
            <li>Favorite eye shadow.</li>
            <li>I bought two, and will reorder some more.  </li>
            <li>This eyeshadow doesn&#x27;t create crease lines on or around my eyes and I have used this for many years.</li>
            <li>This shadow is just okay.</li>
            <li>Just love the color.</li>
            <li>This is my wife&#x27;s favorite eyeshadow makeup and she has used it for years.</li>
            <li>I love the color paired with a brown crease color.</li>
            <li>I love that the chic naturals has so many close color options mattes and shimmers.</li>
            <li>I saw this shadow when I was looking for a low price item to add to my purchase to make it eligible for free shipping, and I&#x27;m so glad I did because it&#x27;s great!  </li>
            <li>It is easy to apply and stays on all day.  </li>
            <li>it was a true taupe, but it ended up more orange/terra cotta in color.  </li>
            <li>So if you are medium complected than this should be fine for you.</li>
            <li>If you want a truly nude shadow and have a light to medium complexion, then this is the color for you.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t cover the eye as smoothly as I like and the color seemed to be too translucent.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s good medium color, not too light not dark.</li>
            <li>I had been looking for some matte eyeshadow because my normal shadow had a bit of shimmer to it and at the end of the day, my eyes just looked kind of greasy/oily from the shine.  </li>
            <li>This basically is not even visible on my eyes, it is flesh colored on me, fairly fair, blond and blue eyed.</li>
            <li>so I ordered from Amazon to get the exact product I needed.</li>
            <li>Pretty color for spring.</li>
            <li>But the matte peachy color is still pretty on.</li>
            <li>so I really had nothing to lose.  </li>
            <li>Earthly Taupe was such a light color, I could use it as face powder ...</li>
            <li>Delivery of this product was fast and inexpensive.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Not really a taupe color, more a peachy shade.</li>
            <li>It is much darker than my skin tone.</li>
            <li>I really regret buying it.</li>
            <li>Surprisingly, Earthly Taupe shadow is in the cool tone makeups, it has a really really slight pink caste but</li>
            <li>You can add more colors to it to create a more dramatic look.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li>just this color in high end brands and eventually started scoping out drugstore brands.  </li>
            <li>I sometimes pop a darker shade on the outer third of my lid if I&#x27;m going out at night, but this is rare.  </li>
            <li>They go on smoothly and last a long time.</li>
            <li>However, once I actually applied it to my lids, I was pleasantly surprised that the color was precisely the one I had been searching for for so long.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s completely matte and because the color is so natural looking for me, it hides the discoloration on my eyelids.  </li>
            <li>BUY looks natural</li>
            <li>Natural looking.  </li>
            <li>It looks so natural.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a mature woman and no longer wear a lot of makeup, especially eye makeup.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this eye shadow and this particular shade, daily,  for over 20 years- looks very natural and blends well with other colors</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s subtle and just nice for hiding dark circles in the corners of your eyes.</li>
            <li>Being a redhead with hazel eyes wearing this with other close colors really helps bring out the blue in my eyes.</li>
            <li>No late day oily shine--I know I&#x27;ll be ordering other shades in the future.  </li>

            <li> It&#x27;s (obviously) a shadow, not a base, so it&#x27;s not creamy, but it&#x27;ll cover the veins, at least, and make it so the other shade goes on evenly.</li>
            <li> I bought this based on the review of supposedly blonde blue eyed persons who said this was a good base for eyeshadow.</li>

            <li> This has always been one of my favorite products and I love the choice in colors.  They go on smoothly and last a long time.</li>
            <li> This color is really good. A bit different then it&#x27;s on picture but it&#x27;s good medium color, not too light not dark. It looks great.</li>
            <li> This is the perfect nude eyeshadow for me.  It matches my skin tone flawlessly and gives me a natural look.  It&#x27;s completely matte and because the color is so natural looking for me, it hides the discoloration on my eyelids.  I&#x27;m so afraid that Maybelline will eventually discontinue this color, that I&#x27;ve stocked up and have several as backups.  I&#x27;m a mature woman and no longer wear a lot of makeup, especially eye makeup.  But I use this shadow all over my lids with a matte white shade as a browbone highlight.  This gives me a wide awake look and with a ton of black mascara and defined brows, makes me look polished without aging me.  I sometimes pop a darker shade on the outer third of my lid if I&#x27;m going out at night, but this is rare.  For years I looked for a matte shadow just this color in high end brands and eventually started scoping out drugstore brands.  I found this quite by accident one day.  It looked a bit darker than I wanted, but it was on sale so I really had nothing to lose.  However, once I actually applied it to my lids, I was pleasantly surprised that the color was precisely the one I had been searching for for so long.  I&#x27;m light, but not fair, with dark blond hair and hazel eyes and this is the perfect nude, invisible shade for me.  I use it with a primer and that helps it last all day and this way, it hides the purple and red blotches on my lids.  This shadow is not highly pigmented so a primer is a must, at least for me.  And I love the matte finish (which I need at my age, lol!).  If you want a truly nude shadow and have a light to medium complexion, then this is the color for you.  And the best part is that it&#x27;s really cheap, so if you like it stock up, you never know when Maybelline will decide to stop making it.  I definitely recommend this color.</li>
            <li> This is the perfect color for blue eyes.  It is easy to apply and stays on all day.  It is perfect day eye shadow.</li>
            <li> good quality of makeup. BUY looks natural</li>
            <li> Earthly Taupe was such a light color, I could use it as face powder ... and I am very fair skinned!</li>
            <li> Favorite eye shadow. Natural looking.  The Matte finish is hard to find.  It looks so natural.  You could use this under any eye shadow or alone which I do.</li>
            <li> This is awesome eye shadow. My favorite for years! Can&#x27;t seem to get it in the stores anymore. Great highlighter! It&#x27;s subtle and just nice for hiding dark circles in the corners of your eyes. It&#x27;s a matte finish so it&#x27;s almost like a foundation and a great camouflage. Can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li> Surprisingly, Earthly Taupe shadow is in the cool tone makeups, it has a really really slight pink caste but not enough pink in there to make your eyelids look sore.&lt;br /&gt;This is slightly off from the picture.&lt;br /&gt;What a find!  I bought two, and will reorder some more.  Very difficult to find makeup that is not yellow based.&lt;br /&gt;I wear this shade on eyelids for day and business wear.&lt;br /&gt;Good eye shadow from Mabelline at an excellent price, as always.</li>
            <li> I have used this product before and it is a &amp;#34;perfect&amp;#34; color for my skin. I live in a small town and the merchants here did not have this product so I ordered from Amazon to get the exact product I needed. This eyeshadow doesn&#x27;t create crease lines on or around my eyes and I have used this for many years. Delivery of this product was fast and inexpensive.</li>
            <li> Awesome! Fast shipping. I&#x27;m fair and this color is a great neutral for my skin tone and age of 40 something. Very happy!</li>
            <li> I had been looking for some matte eyeshadow because my normal shadow had a bit of shimmer to it and at the end of the day, my eyes just looked kind of greasy/oily from the shine.  I saw this shadow when I was looking for a low price item to add to my purchase to make it eligible for free shipping, and I&#x27;m so glad I did because it&#x27;s great!  No late day oily shine--I know I&#x27;ll be ordering other shades in the future.  I would recommend this eyeshadow!</li>
            <li> Pretty color for spring. Not really a taupe color, more a peachy shade. But the matte peachy color is still pretty on.</li>
            <li> I have been using this eye shadow and this particular shade, daily,  for over 20 years- looks very natural and blends well with other colors I may use to add a highlight and additional color. Lasts and lasts!</li>
            <li> I bought this based on the review of supposedly blonde blue eyed persons who said this was a good base for eyeshadow. It is not for a truly fair skinned person. It is much darker than my skin tone. I would think this would be best for a medium skin toned person. I can use this only as the darkest color of the shadow ( crease color) that you are supposed to use as a trio... base, highlight, and crease colors.  I cannot use this as a base.I really regret buying it. It is so hard to find matte eyeshadows in the drugstores now as Revlon has removed their matte base eyeshadow line. Not everyone is under the age of 30 and can wear the sparkly eyeshadows. So if you are medium complected than this should be fine for you.</li>
            <li> This shadow is just okay. It doesn&#x27;t cover the eye as smoothly as I like and the color seemed to be too translucent.&lt;br /&gt;I will not purchase again.</li>
            <li> I actually use this shade when I want to look like I&#x27;m not wearing any makeup at all. It matches my skin tone fairly well and covers my eyelid veins. It might pop more on another person&#x27;s skin tone, but, for me, it&#x27;s just a good neutral. I also use it as a base under other eyeshadows, as it evens out my skin. It&#x27;s (obviously) a shadow, not a base, so it&#x27;s not creamy, but it&#x27;ll cover the veins, at least, and make it so the other shade goes on evenly.</li>
            <li> Goes with any combination and does not clog the poores. My daughters borrow this item all the time. Just love the color.</li>
            <li> This basically is not even visible on my eyes, it is flesh colored on me, fairly fair, blond and blue eyed.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product not only for an eye shadow but for a concealer as well. Works great for me.</li>
            <li> This is my wife&#x27;s favorite eyeshadow makeup and she has used it for years. The Amazon price is good and with Prime shipping it is a good deal. She likes this color as it is a neutral color and it is good for someone who does not wear a lot of makeup. You can add more colors to it to create a more dramatic look. She likes it a lot and says that it applies well to her eyes. She recommends it to you.</li>
            <li> I use this eyeshadow almost every single day. I love the color paired with a brown crease color. It stays on ALL day long even after a longgg day of work.</li>
            <li> Disappears on my pale skin and actually is peachy not taupe. I can&#x27;t wear anything peachy with my pale ruddy complextion. That&#x27;s why I thought I bought taupe....</li>
            <li> I bought this thinking it was a true taupe, but it ended up more orange/terra cotta in color.  It is useless to me.</li>
            <li> Being a redhead with hazel eyes wearing this with other close colors really helps bring out the blue in my eyes. I love that the chic naturals has so many close color options mattes and shimmers.</li>
