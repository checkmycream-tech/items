            <li>i guess the best thing to do is to use a chap stick then apply this and on top of it, you need a lip stick or you will look someone dropped cigarette ashes on your lips...</li>

            <li>An awesome color selection they put for this pack, the pigmentation &amp; smoothness to apply it is okay.</li>

            <li>Happy to see them brecause they were good in quality.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re so beautiful and exotic !</li>
            <li>beautiful, they have amazing colors,&lt;br /&gt;jsjs</li>
            <li>all 6 pencils are amazing and all shades are beautiful and they stay on for a looong time</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re easy to put on and the colors are perfect.</li>
            <li>and i can surely say this is best for one of my kind.</li>
            <li>These are brightly pigmaneted colors, as others have said.  </li>
            <li>Unless you like bright shiny/sparkling lip colors I would not recommend buying these.</li>
            <li>&amp;#34;Tangerine&amp;#34; is a bright (think barbie)</li>
            <li>I was scared they would be too bright</li>
            <li>Just to bright for me.</li>
            <li>Also I did not receive that bright orange color</li>
            <li>But the colors are just too bright..</li>
            <li>Nyx is always a good brand.</li>
            <li>they are gorgeous</li>
            <li>I have always loved nyx lip liners.</li>
            <li>I loved the variety of colors in this group.</li>
            <li>I loved the colors..</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried NYX pencils before and loved them</li>
            <li>Really good</li>
            <li>It is definitely a good deal</li>
            <li>I was using some Korean brand lip liners and thought they were  good but</li>
            <li>The price was definitely good but not the product.</li>
            <li>Just doesn&#x27;t look good.</li>
            <li>my drug store brands &amp; cheaper make up &amp; I have always liked NYX Products, they have great afordable cosmetics.</li>
            <li>The colors are absolutely gorgeous and has a lot of pigment in them.  </li>
            <li>Good variety of pinks.</li>
            <li>The colors are good and pigmented.</li>
            <li>Always have loved NYX Cosmetics products...such good pigment in these lipliners.</li>
            <li>So cheap and great quality with everything of theirs!!</li>
            <li>This was a good deal.</li>
            <li>Nyx lip liners are a good buy.</li>
            <li>They are quite good, and not over priced.</li>
            <li>I have used NYX  lip pencils for a while and was grateful to find these for a good price.</li>
            <li>I loved the price</li>
            <li>Good conditions</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;re good to go.</li>
            <li>Its also good way to tint your lip</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good deal for the money though.</li>
            <li>the quality is good though..</li>
            <li>stuff is great, though, and very easy to apply, so</li>
            <li>I love the variety of colors, and the orange one is surprisingly beautiful.  </li>
            <li>These bright and fun colors pair perfectly with NYX matte lipsticks.  </li>
            <li>So affordable and the staying power is awesome plus they&#x27;re super pigmented.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great cost if you love bright colors</li>
            <li>I love , It&#x27;s great , good pigmentation  </li>
            <li>Really nice colors, all good quality and in good condition.</li>
            <li>I recommend for those who wear bright colors on their lips--the pinks match most of my collection!</li>
            <li>These are my very first NYX lip liners, and i am very happy with them.</li>
            <li>Great colors, and the lip pencils go on very smoothly.</li>
            <li>These liners go on very smoothly and pack alot of color!</li>

            <li>they go on so creamy and smooth then when they &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34; they become a beautiful matte color.</li>
            <li>I have a liner to go with my favorite lipsticks!</li>
            <li>The NYX liners are lovely!</li>
            <li>I love these lip liners!</li>
            <li>Nice colors easy to apply and great value.</li>
            <li>Love the pigmentation of these colors, although they are bright</li>
            <li>NYX has amazing lip liners.</li>
            <li>they are amazing</li>
            <li>These are amazing, so pigmented and creamy, not to mention long-lasting.</li>
            <li>I already knew NYX products were great, so when I found these for so cheap</li>
            <li>but they weren&#x27;t a great fit for me with complexion.</li>
            <li>the colors are amazing.</li>
            <li>The lip liners are more bright colors.</li>
            <li>I honestly use these a lipsticks.</li>
            <li>The packaging of these pencils do not match my own Nyx pencils.</li>
            <li>arrived ahead of schedule which was nice</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good more then</li>
            <li>kind of an impulse buy.</li>
            <li>I purchased these to go with some of the lipsticks I own.</li>
            <li>This is a great price for such wonderful lip colors!!</li>
            <li>They can stand on their own, or be combined to make a personalized color.</li>
            <li>My wife liked the set and that is what counts.</li>
            <li>This is a really nice set, and for the price, you can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
            <li>I liked them so much that my best friend ordered some as well.</li>
            <li>the colors show up nice.</li>
            <li>These pencils are nice.</li>
            <li>Some are nice colors others not so nice</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll try my best to describe the colors if anyone wants to take the time to read through this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Nice lip liners in multi colors.</li>
            <li>Looks so beautiful as a full lipstick or just outline...</li>

            <li>I love these lip pencils there</li>
            <li>Nice and smooth application.</li>
            <li>I wish there were more orange colors offered but</li>
            <li>I wear them alone under gloss/lipbalm for the most part.</li>
            <li>I really liked these, smooth application.</li>
            <li>Love nyx liners</li>
            <li>okay...</li>

            <li>thank you so much i love it</li>
            <li>I really love lip liners</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure about this ones, but the price made me want to try them...</li>
            <li>I love the colors I was sent.</li>
            <li>Love me and why ask lip pencil</li>
            <li>Love the variety of colors.</li>
            <li>In love with this</li>
            <li>in fact its better than some of the M.A.C that I have .</li>
            <li>Of course you can find better but to start off and not pay an arm and leg</li>
            <li>The colors are ok.</li>
            <li>Would have preferred more neutral colors in this pack.</li>
            <li>But they&#x27;re ok.</li>
            <li>I love the colors by the way.</li>
            <li>I love these colors, except the pencil can be a bit drying on the lips.</li>
            <li>I like the nyx retractable liners better because theyre more moisturizing.</li>
            <li>Although I love their lipsticks and lipliner, it hurt my wallet to break out $15 every time my favorite lipliner ran out.</li>
            <li>I immediately fell in love.</li>
            <li>but mostly I just use fuchsia.</li>
            <li>I would use for sure.</li>
            <li>, I just wish the colors were more usable.</li>
            <li>but I love more pink,nude colors.</li>
            <li>Love color and pigment</li>
            <li>I love the colors.</li>
            <li>so I am Pleased.</li>
            <li>and i love the variety of colors.</li>
            <li>and I love the matte colors.</li>
            <li>Thus, I ordered the set because I liked the colors and was hopeful that they were as pigmented and applied as smoothly as some reviewers reported.      </li>
            <li>and i love them.</li>
            <li>They do stay on most of the day, but I like to reapply after I eat.</li>
            <li>So I think it really was a great purchase.</li>
            <li>they are OK.</li>
            <li>they are perfect and when they are finished i am definitely ordering again!</li>
            <li>I love the saturation of color from these lip liner pencils.  </li>
            <li>Im more of a matte look person so</li>
            <li>Theyre the nude one and the light orange one.&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise!</li>
            <li>Coloures were also ok.</li>
            <li>Just got my lip pencils an IM in love</li>

            <li>I love these colors perfect for bright, vibrant colors of lipstick to match completely to make my lips look fuller!</li>
            <li>Lasts decently long :) Great price!</li>
            <li>but It was a good price for 4 and very fast shipping two days.</li>
            <li>They were delivered quick and I just LOVE the colors !</li>
            <li>Pretty colors, good pigmentation, not as creamy as I would like</li>
            <li>Also the statements about them being too liquidly make no sense because they are lip liner pencils and have a good consistent quality,</li>
            <li>good dealing and the shipment exactly as described</li>
            <li>Good quality, pretty colors.</li>

            <li>I really love the colors and thought it wouldn&#x27;t be a huge loss if I didn&#x27;t like them....</li>
            <li>I really like the colors, and how it does not look too bright or out of place on me.</li>
            <li>I felt that it looked more of a light and wasn&#x27;t concentrated to the point where it matched my lipsticks.</li>
            <li>These go on smooth and I love the packaging.</li>
            <li>Again in pictures they look pretty bright but in reality they r too light.</li>
            <li>Shipping was faster then expected and the liners are great!</li>
            <li>There better than the cheap beauty supply brands.</li>
            <li>Especially love 2 pink colors.</li>
            <li>they fit everything better.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery and good product&lt;br /&gt;Thxxxx</li>
            <li>These are very opaque and stay put for a good while.</li>
            <li>Great lip pencils for the price.... not dark and stays where you line your lips!  </li>
            <li>I have just one color now and love it so much that I want more colors... and what a deal!</li>
            <li>I love my lip liners, arrived on time, so cheap, really usefull products, finally I love the colors because are so trendy, the shades are variable,</li>

            <li>They&#x27;re easy to apply.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re long-lasting and easy to blend.</li>
            <li>i satisfact with the effect also, chromatically is easy,  </li>
            <li>nice colors get more thanks</li>
            <li>and they do go on easily,</li>
            <li>These are amazing for the price, such good quality, anyone in 2 minds, buy them&lt;br</li>
            <li>They glide on easily have somewhat of a creamy feeling.</li>
            <li>I love NYX brand, and was expecting something great, and I definitely received it!!!</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>they are easily transportable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>/&gt;These NYX liners are easy to apply because they practically glide across the lip - no drying out or tugging.</li>
            <li>Just as good as high end lip liners.  </li>
            <li>Although, I found that the colors are all great for summer and are very in fashion right now.</li>
            <li>Very good quality, although I wouldn&#x27;t mind if their colour was more intense and not that soft</li>
            <li>I liked that there were so many colors to choose from, however a couple of them have a real orange tint to them that isn&#x27;t flattering at all to my light skin tone.  </li>
            <li>I love these lip liners...extremely true to color.  </li>
            <li>I actually ended up LOVING the Rose color the most.</li>
            <li>I bought these because the colors looked so beautiful and when I received them they definitely were</li>
            <li>Always purchased the warm set of lip liners from this brand also, so much cheaper than buying them separately from the original website!</li>
            <li>smooth texture vibrant color  and a good value.</li>
            <li>They  came in good condition and brand new.</li>
            <li>Slim and easy to fit in a pocket or purse</li>
            <li>Wow the colors are true to the picture packaging was great</li>
            <li>even somebody who has no idea what they&#x27;re doing can still do it just fine.</li>
            <li>I find these work just fine</li>
            <li>Receive the package quickly !</li>
            <li>The pack comes with a great variety of colors, making it very easy for me to match these lip liners with other brands as well.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping, and I love the colors!</li>
            <li>The price is extremely reasonable, so I look forward to eventually purchasing more!</li>
            <li>Very pretty colors!</li>
            <li>They are really rich so they are easy to blend, but if you apply acouple of layers you can still manage to get an ombre.</li>
            <li>Once I got them I was super excited to try every color on!</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth and overall great piece to my makeup collection Compairable to my Mac lip liners.</li>
            <li>there creamy and smooth on the lips.</li>
            <li>I enjoy all of the NYX cosmetic line.</li>
            <li>I blot and lightly powder this liner, stays on all day.</li>
            <li>They go on smoothly and stay on.</li>
            <li>I was hoping to lightly line my lips and use lipgloss</li>
            <li>Overall, great products.</li>
            <li>I enjoy this product.</li>
            <li>The liners are really smooth and creamy.</li>
            <li>They are pigmented and smooth.</li>
            <li>The price is also cheap.</li>
            <li>They were really happy with and have been using it regularly.</li>
            <li>Obviously not as pigmented as others but great price.</li>
            <li>of course I use a lip conditioner before I apply them but they are smooth pencils</li>
            <li>The light purple is too light as well.</li>
            <li>&amp;#34;Dolly Pink/ Rose Poupee&amp;#34; is a bright light purple with a bit of pink color.</li>
            <li>Got these on time and the colors are fantastic.</li>
            <li>My favorite is Orange which is the most beautiful red that looks great alone, Pinky, a pretty magenta that looks awesome under pink lipstick, and Tangerine, a satin-finish nude pink that is amazing with a clear gloss ontop.</li>
            <li>Fantastic deal</li>
            <li>I like the others but, but they are a bit light.</li>
            <li>and I think, especially for the $$, that these are great.  </li>
            <li>but I must say it just feels cheap.</li>
            <li>Nyx has a great reputation with quality products to back it up.  </li>
            <li>These are great lip liners, especially for the price.</li>
            <li>The ones I ordered do NOT apply smoothly at all.  </li>
            <li>NYX is a great brand, definitely would recommend.</li>
            <li>The pencil is not creamy and does not glid smoothly.</li>
            <li>Love the fun colors and they stay on so well.</li>
            <li>nyx isn&#x27;t the most amazing quality in general but these pencils has a strong wood smell, which is distracting when applying to lips.</li>
            <li>less a must have ! ♥</li>
            <li>Love the range of colors and the price is right.</li>
            <li>Such a great brand and these pencils have great pigmentation and as long as you mosturize your lips before applying they go on smoothly.</li>
            <li>What&#x27;s more important is that the price was very reasonable.</li>
            <li>They sharpen super easily, The color lasts all day.</li>
            <li>I purchased these liners cuz I have purchased other NYX products and had very good results, specially their blushes.</li>
            <li>Wish there were a little more choices for colors, considering I have much darker skin, still awesome, would buy again.</li>
            <li>I fell in love with every single lip liner and the colors stayed on thru a good duration of time before having to reapply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love these so much!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m very pleased with them so far.</li>
            <li>I was so excited after reading these reviews</li>
            <li>I love all the colors and they look so pretty and work so well with my skin tone</li>
            <li>Theyre the best purchase I have ever made from NYX, usually I dont wear lip liners but these changed my mind.</li>
            <li>Also, I originally purchased it specifically because of the orange liner.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to get this Lip liner set, but all my excitement wore off when I got them.</li>
            <li>Its totally worth buying!</li>
            <li>, they&#x27;re thinner, kinda like a eye liner, but that is to be expected with viewing something on a screen, but a great price for 6 liners, the colors are pretty nice, but all very similar, &amp; as some others mentioned in there reviews kinda neon-like colors very bright &amp; as I said very close to one another, I sometimes bright neon colors, so this is fine for me but maybe not suited for other&#x27;s taste</li>
            <li>I also pull out the lipliner over full lips and add transparent gloss on top of it which makes look as though i have applied that particular color lipstick which is great, u dont need to buy different shades of glosses or lipsticks.</li>
            <li>By far my favorite lip liners!</li>
            <li>The  colors are perfect and each lip liner gives a unique look to the face,i am a naive user</li>
            <li>These are the best because I&#x27;ve used different brands and these products are super soft.</li>
            <li>orange is so bright and vivid and looks just like a reddish orange and the pink dolly is so bright and reminds me of Nicki manaj lips or whatnot.</li>
            <li>I will be purchasing more of them Great little gift!</li>
            <li>This product and NYX brand in general are reasonably priced for a great value.</li>
            <li>there are 2 colors that looks similar to one another like orange and tangerine except tangerine isn&#x27;t as bright</li>
            <li>Great quality a wide variety of colors</li>
            <li>The packaging is good and arrived earlier.</li>
            <li>The price is really good, especially considering to find colors like these</li>
            <li>Only two of the colors are good for using-Orange and Pinky.</li>
            <li>(but I go for more modern colors...)</li>
            <li>I really like most of these colors.</li>
            <li>colors are true to color on end.</li>
            <li>and I love NYX but together not so much.</li>
            <li>this set of lip liner are just what I needed, it is soft and glided nicely on my lips ..</li>
            <li>i love the colors and it stays on really will</li>
            <li>Overall good product.</li>
            <li>thanks for they :)</li>
            <li>As stated in my caption, this is only for the pink and coral tones which is great for the summer and still good for your collection in winter.</li>
            <li>Not bad.</li>
            <li>These are super cool Lip pencil.</li>
            <li>Having a large variety of Lip Liners really come in handy.  </li>
            <li>Other than that the quality is great.</li>
            <li>Great lip liners that end up matching other non NYX lipsticks that I have, even my ruby woo lipstick from MAC matches the pencils.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Other than that the arrival time was great.</li>
            <li>They came in super quick as well.</li>
            <li>Its nice to try a variety of colors to test out for such a cheap price.</li>
            <li>I love that I got so many different colors</li>
            <li>nice and lovely as expected by my wife.</li>
            <li>The delivery was quick.</li>
            <li>This purchase came in the mail pretty quickly!</li>
            <li>shipping was quick and everything was wrapped well.</li>
            <li>The products arrived quickly and well-packaged.</li>
            <li>These are great to experiment with if you&#x27;re new to lipliners, or makeup in general!</li>
            <li>The glad very soft &amp; soomth to the touch!</li>
            <li>These are a million times better than the high end,</li>
            <li>I also was expecting the orange shade to be more orange-ish, but upon arrival it was very muted.&lt;br /&gt;All 6 pencils go on very creamy, smooth, and true matte.</li>
            <li>After those long nights out when I get in and K.O. without taking my makeup off, this lip liner is STILL in place and bright when I wake up.</li>
            <li>Great color turnout, stays on pretty long, lots of fun colors.</li>
            <li>but egh tht are still very pretty</li>
            <li>Not only did they arrive super fast... but the color pay off is amazing!</li>
            <li>Mostly because of the price, but also, I have never even heard of NYX makeup, so it was all new to me.  </li>
            <li>So maybe if anything I will love a new lip look that I thought I would never wear.</li>
            <li>Great buy you save about $2 for each lip liner and it arrived in less than 5 days.</li>
            <li>Super fun lip linnets for spring and summer.</li>
            <li>up.&lt;br /&gt;These colors are perfect, you can sharpen these pencils, meaning they last long...</li>
            <li>Not as good as a Mac lip liner if your looking for that quality of a liner, they are not creamy if your looking for a creamy lip liner, there kinda dry</li>
            <li>Very happy with product and will deffinately recommend and it last long n ur lips luv it</li>
            <li>Will be back for more!</li>
            <li>so pretty!</li>
            <li>All pretty!</li>
            <li>colors are hot!</li>
            <li>so i can not compare its excellence with other liners but for me for the first use it did a great job.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it , colors are very true to pics</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s very creamy and slides on the lips smooth.</li>
            <li>I think the Pinks are amazing, the red and oranges I rarely use.</li>
            <li>I had read the reviews for this set of NYX pencils, and while most said they liked them, the ones who didn&#x27;t were quite adamant, leaving specific reasons why.  </li>
            <li>It worth buying</li>
            <li>something I probably would have never tried otherwise, but actually ended up loving.</li>
            <li>I was hoping for more natural hues, but what I got was basically neon colors.  </li>
            <li>but for the price it was worth giving these a shot.</li>
            <li>the 2nd one is kind of goldish</li>
            <li>For the price I think they are worth the money.</li>
            <li>you get your money&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li>I was surprised, watch the type of lip stick because it makes the lips stand out more</li>
            <li>I was a little, err, ok, a LOT, surprised by these FABULOUS lip liners!!!  </li>
            <li>Just like the other liners I ordered, I love NYX make up and will order more once I run out.</li>
            <li>;) , that goes for bold lips.</li>
            <li>Of course the orange one is NO for me but the purple pink and the brownsih pink look pretty good on and the pigment is really good</li>
            <li>All of the colors are great and what is a major plus is that i now have a liner match for all six of my individual &amp;</li>
            <li>sharpening can be a bit of a challenge but other than that they are all good</li>
            <li>Other than that, its a good product.</li>
            <li>usually stick with Mac bc of the color selection and pigmentation of the colors, or Revlon Colorstay lip-liner in nude because it honestly stays on all day, and is complimentary to many lipsticks and</li>
            <li>I scooped them right up.</li>
            <li>but I do have fun having barbie lips today and it looked good with my dark hair.</li>
            <li>Over all I&#x27;am pleased with this purchase for the price but on the other hand a tad bit dissapointed because the colors look so much different than when you put them on &amp; it should state that they are bright &amp; bold and neon types.</li>
            <li>lip liners are significantly longer (in physical length), so there is more product, but they are also sold at a higher price point.</li>
            <li>Smooth, highly pigmented lip pencils.  </li>
            <li>I have tried many different pencils before and so far these are my favorite ones.</li>
            <li>Color didn&#x27;t stay on long, but nice colors</li>
            <li>The color lasts all day and are very vibrant!</li>
            <li>These are a little smaller than what I thought but perfect</li>
            <li>less bright (not neon) but still not a practical color.</li>
            <li>/&gt;According to her all colors are nice, and they last much longer compared to others.</li>
            <li>great quality liners especially if  you&#x27;re starting a kit.</li>
            <li>I outline and fill in my lips then apply a nude gloss…viola, new color!!!</li>
            <li>and they went on smooth and felt very soft.</li>
            <li>This is not my first time purchasing from this seller, they ship super fast.</li>
            <li>It was very much needed.</li>
            <li>thank you so much , very fast shipment&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
            <li>They are nice but they make my lips very dry.</li>
            <li>Some of them are nice and creamy and some are very dry.</li>
            <li>/&gt;These colors are highly pigmented and not subdued at all if you&#x27;re more of a natural person.</li>
            <li>They are quite pigmentented, can&#x27;t beat the price, and shipping time is really fast!</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re really creamy, and they just glide on!</li>
            <li>this is the first time.</li>
            <li>I think they are of great quality and the last for a really long time.</li>
            <li>Love NXY, would definitely buy again.</li>
            <li>All of the colors are really pretty.</li>
            <li>Great colors and long lasting.</li>
            <li>I rushed straight to the bath room and tried all of the colors one after another!  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t mind reapplying ;)</li>
            <li>well first of i wanna say i like these lip colors and their well pigmented</li>
            <li>i can rock them.....;)</li>
            <li>they really changed my view on lip liners!</li>
            <li>Colors are pretty.</li>
            <li>you may want to put lip balm first.</li>
            <li>I had to do several rounds of this before I was able to put on my lipstick</li>
            <li>, remember they don&#x27;t have to match the lipstick shade exactly.</li>
            <li>They arrived 3 days after I purchased them, 4 days before the first day of the delivery estimate.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve moved on to higher quality products.</li>
            <li>pretty colors wish there were some nudes and purples</li>
            <li>color &amp;#34;Orange&amp;#34; is more of a red with orange undertones.</li>
            <li>the ones that come in the group are pretty.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I tried Nyx anything</li>
            <li>I guess it depends on what your skin is like and what your willing to do to make them work.</li>
            <li>First of all, you must apply lip balm for the color to even go on, not creamy at all.</li>
            <li>like I expected bit if you mix them they can be nice colored</li>
            <li>Fast shipping!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Quality of these NYX lip liners is most similar, in my opinion, to MACs lip-liners.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!!</li>
            <li>In fact, I often use them for my whole lip or even on my eyes!</li>
            <li>A good way to get a few colors of NYX liners to try.</li>
            <li>the colors are vivid and worth getting if you many colors and wouldn&#x27;t mind a little more.</li>
            <li>They wear very well and the colors are just right for summer or fall.  </li>
            <li>Definitely worth the buy if you need some new lip liners!</li>
            <li>It does not feel good and the colors are not very nice.</li>
            <li>I realize some of the reviews for this were good and bad, but I loved the product.</li>
            <li>I bought this lot only because of the color dolly pink and because it was a great deal also</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m not a big fan of big brand names, just good quality.</li>
            <li>Applies well and stays pretty much all day.</li>
            <li>I am wearing Dolly Pink today, and it goes perfect with the 901B by Wet n&#x27; Wild.</li>
            <li>I give it 4 stars only because the colors seem more vibrant in pictures</li>
            <li>Other than that they are very easy to apply.</li>
            <li>so don&#x27;t except super soft lips</li>
            <li>so if bright neon colors are not your thing this buy will be a waste for you, now the colors go on nice &amp; the color stay on a decent amount of time, but not long lasting all day, but I do like them</li>
            <li>I love these and use them every single day.</li>
            <li>A good range of colors for someone with very pale skin, like me.</li>
            <li>The colors are a bit too much in the photos but looks more normal in the actual product.</li>
            <li>My lips are very sensitive to most lip products and this is the only brand I&#x27;ve found that I can wear without irritation.</li>
            <li>I live NYX and these lip liners are quality; they are alays a staple in my very large make up bag.</li>
            <li>I gave it a 4-star rating because it would be nice to have them be a little creamier and easier to apply.</li>
            <li>I really love every single color!</li>
            <li>I sometimes just use these to add a little color &amp; then top with a light clear gloss or balm.</li>
            <li>plus there very affordable.</li>
            <li>Thanks for amAzon.</li>
            <li>I am very please with this.</li>
            <li>Eyelinera are pigmented, full size, long lasting and who doesn&#x27;t love variety of colors.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a real</li>
            <li>I really like these lip liners.  </li>
            <li>I will always ready to shop with them again ...</li>
            <li>really to hide the pigmentation of my lip color</li>
            <li>They were really affordable.</li>
            <li>Delivery was fast.</li>
            <li>They do seem very cakey.</li>
            <li>I guess I have really pigmented lips, so the lighter colors don&#x27;t really show up on my lips.</li>
            <li>isn&#x27;t really hotpink</li>
            <li>Arrived fast</li>
            <li>the pencils are very well pigmented</li>
            <li>I really do recommend this to all girl, all ages</li>
            <li>and I really like them.</li>
            <li>Thanks u so much.</li>
            <li>and it didn&#x27;t blend very well.</li>
            <li>Maybe it was knock off of the real NYX  lip liner I don&#x27;t know.</li>
            <li>and I really like the colors, very versatile and can work with just about any color</li>
            <li>I really expected more from this brand.</li>
            <li>THANKS</li>
            <li>and I am VERY impress, you can use this lip liners with your lipstick- lip gloss or use your lip balm and use them as a filler.&lt;br /&gt;They</li>
            <li>&amp;#34;Pinky/Rose&amp;#34; reminds me a lot of the &amp;#34;Sand Pink/Sable Rose&amp;#34; except more pink in tone than purple.&lt;br</li>
            <li>These were really drying on my lips and when I rubbed my lips together they just wouldn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>i didn&#x27;t really expect these colors</li>
            <li>these liners are very pigmented.</li>
            <li>The colors are too light and don&#x27;t last</li>
            <li>She sent me the correct color at a very speedy process</li>
            <li>I would highly suggest them!</li>
            <li>the two pencils that were shimmer-ish dont really suit me.</li>
            <li>I occasionally wear the liner on it&#x27;s own by filling in the entire lip, giving a light matte look that really does last all night.  </li>
            <li>They are great lip liners and came in quickly the only reason I gave it four stars are because it doesn&#x27;t include any darker colored liners for red or dark lipsticks.</li>
            <li>I have found that they are long wearing and are great for preventing color bleeding when wearing red lipsticks especially.</li>
            <li>I love the other colors for the lip liners</li>
            <li>They look amazing and last long enough.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li>NYX Cosmetics Long Lasting Slim Lip Liner Pencils 6 Colors are amazing.</li>
            <li>If your lips are dry, I would recommend softening them up with a lip balm before applying these because they will get a little dry/chalky feeling and not look as great.  </li>
            <li>nice, colors, but they are all pretty similar to each other.</li>
            <li>Mac Lip Liners, I decided I would save them for special occasions and find a cheaper alternative for daily use.  </li>
            <li>I expected a little bit more better quality from these.</li>
            <li>the only thing is that they are kind of dry</li>
            <li>They are the exact colors from the picture and came early.</li>
            <li>Once you manage to have it on, the color still won&#x27;t fully cover your lips, you can always put a similar color lipstick on for full coverage.</li>
            <li>Then I think rose and that other pink shade are similar as well and one is more vivid and bright and the other is a tone or two down but they are sooooooo PRETTY!</li>
            <li>The only reason these get 4 stars is the colors were just a little too bright for my taste.</li>
            <li>Anything black I think looks really elegant.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t know if they&#x27;re an older style of packaging or knock offs.</li>
            <li>The only thing is the color doesn&#x27;t last more than 3-4 hours...</li>
            <li>The colors are really very pretty, which is the only reason why I would give three stars if any.</li>
            <li>Other than the orange, the colors were very vibrant.&lt;br /&gt;All 6 pencils last a very long time, and look great just by themselves.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li>The shipping was fast, and right when i got it i instantly tried everyone on.</li>
            <li>soft and smooth, glides easily on my lips, last longer than my other lip liners and the colors</li>
            <li>this price, I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend these liners.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this set.</li>
            <li>longlasting and high pigmented</li>
            <li>, I have my high end make up &amp;</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>But the picture is high in contrast</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>These pencils are of high quality, and high pigment.  </li>
            <li>Matches all of my pink and coral lipsticks just fine.  </li>
            <li>so far it&#x27;s very vibrant and eye-catching.</li>
            <li>The color choices are nice and not too similar to each other.</li>
            <li>Wish they were just a little more softer when you put them on your lips.</li>
            <li>I will say that the pencil, overall, looks pretty in the drawer!    </li>
            <li>light pink.</li>
            <li>Performs as pencil lip liners are expected to perform, colors are accurate.</li>
            <li>My only complaint is that they&#x27;re not as creamy as I would have liked, so there is a bit of tug when applying, but I still think they&#x27;re worth the purchase.</li>
            <li>but then the colors useful are only 3 in the package.</li>
            <li>ever since I was told that I&#x27;ve been having fun with different colors for the summer.</li>
            <li>I do like these colors but 3 of them are so light and similar that you could barely see the color.</li>
            <li>There are 6 colors and only two of them are useful...</li>
            <li>The color stays quite long and no bad scent at all.</li>
            <li>More than half the cost at Ulta!  </li>
            <li>I like the more pale ones.</li>
            <li>I have wanted Nyx cosmetics ever since I saw &amp;#34;Ru Pauls Drag Race.&amp;#34;  I was so excited when I opened the package</li>
            <li>The other colors are too light for me.  </li>
            <li>If your new to make up this set is for you.</li>
            <li>They are a lot smaller than I expected (the pictures make them look more like chubby sticks</li>
            <li>the nice pink one is not mauvy pink</li>
            <li>Their pigmentation is strong, and when applied to, and worn on my lips, the pigment lasts a typical amount of time for lip liners that are not classified as &amp;</li>
            <li>It didnt take to long to arrive and I got exactly what I paid for !</li>
            <li>The others two light orange i find pretty similar to each other</li>
            <li>Easy to apply and long lasting.</li>
            <li>Worth the buy and long wearing.  </li>
            <li>Soft lip liners!  </li>
            <li>The colors are so vivid.  </li>
            <li>Wet &amp; wild is similar quality for cheaper as well, more product, and isn&#x27;t as drying.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re affordable and you usually get more than what you pay for .</li>
            <li>I had lots of different lip glosses and sticks that matches them pretty well.</li>
            <li>Also, I got exactly the colors it shows above .</li>
            <li>I did like 2 out of the 6 but first of all they weren&#x27;t close to the color on the tip and 2nd</li>
            <li>But two of them are almost exactly the same and</li>
            <li>My favorite, so far is a pink with blue undertones called &amp;#34;Dolly.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>shade range is great, the only one missing is a deep red</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t really like it and the one that appears hot pink</li>
            <li>A couple are very light and hard to see.</li>
            <li>They may be slightly more pigmented than those 99-cent Wet &#x27;N Wild pencils, but what good does that do when they are dry and difficult to apply at all?  </li>
            <li>I have some cheap other lips pencils that last hours and this one doesnt last more than half hour without correction.</li>
            <li>The colors are not very vivid and don&#x27;t exactly match up to the color you would think you were using.</li>
            <li>colors are different, so some people might have experienced a packaging issue or they might be color blind.</li>
            <li>I like to put a clear Chapstick over them like an eos.</li>
            <li>Seems old and color is not pigmented.</li>
            <li>They just complete all of my make up looks.</li>
            <li>The colors weren&#x27;t as natural as they should&#x27;ve been.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really natural on my skin tone, which is what I wanted.</li>
            <li>wow</li>
            <li>for me not a total bust &amp; I will make use of them &amp; a fast ship..</li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t have to use much so these should last me a while.</li>
            <li>I thought there were repeated colors, but once I tried them they really are different shades.</li>
            <li>I often find my self directing people to amazon to purchase these pencils because of the frequent questions and compliments.</li>
            <li>I will be passing these along to my young niece for her play makeup kit.  </li>
            <li>I like the natural colors in this product.</li>
            <li>so I can fill in the brown outline I naturally have.</li>
            <li>have used many lip liners from various high-end brands, as well as quite a few from Revlon and L&#x27;oreal (Target or Drug Store Brand).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>you don&#x27;t have to buy expensive products to look good and this is an example of practical items you must have</li>
            <li>They are good quality but the colors are almost the same , I am not happy with my purchase</li>
            <li>However, they are nice colors other than that little tidbit.</li>
            <li>My only challenge is pulling this particular set of colors off with pigmented lips.</li>
            <li>I love NYX products for the most part, but I was kinda disappointed when I used these.</li>
            <li>You can always blot the color a bit and apply some lip balm (if you don&#x27;t like the dry feel since it&#x27;s very Matte applied alone) to achieve a more subtle look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I do like the two that are a hot pink color.  </li>
            <li>but I would not say overly dry, do not expect them to be as large as they look on the ad</li>
            <li>OK, sounds weird, but I&#x27;m really close with my Grandma</li>
            <li>Very pigmented and long lasting.  </li>
            <li>They are very pigmented and last long</li>
            <li>Very creamy and long lasting.</li>
            <li>These came in SO fast, and the quality is amazingly long lasting under lipstick.</li>
            <li>These weren&#x27;t bad, kind of sheer but overall not bad colors.</li>
            <li>they are long lasting and hold up very well.</li>
            <li>all of them are very pigmented and have a wide range of colors.</li>
            <li>but this is not possible, as you cannot blend neon colors into your natural lip.  </li>
            <li>I will be using them in the near future.</li>
            <li>The color &amp;#34;Sand Pink/Sable Rose&amp;#34; Is a midton-pink leaning towards the purpley side, The color &amp;#34;Rose&amp;#34; is straight mid-tone pink.</li>
            <li>I bought the lip liners for a young lady starting out being a makeup artist.</li>
            <li>These are pretty generic lipliners in harder to find colors.</li>
            <li>The colors in this set are pretty, but very similar to each other.  </li>
            <li>The only stuff I normally use on my lips is lip balm, because I am a French horn performance student and anything with colour on it automatically wipes off onto my horn mouthpiece, not to mention that I don&#x27;t actually know how to put on lip liner.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>I guess, not much of a dry feeling.</li>
            <li>I do wish they were a little more smoother and less dry tho.</li>
            <li>Like other name brand cosmetics companies, they have a wide arrangement of proud st, but not at the expensive name brand price.  </li>
            <li>Terrible, - very light for a very light person.  </li>
            <li>It is absolutely not long lasting at all!!!</li>
            <li>but it is not really long lasting</li>
            <li>But they are not long lasting at all.  </li>
            <li>Not long lasting at all.</li>
            <li>very stiff, kind of hard to put on</li>

            <li> These are brightly pigmaneted colors, as others have said.  </li>
            <li> Unless you like bright shiny/sparkling lip colors I would not recommend buying these.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Tangerine&amp;#34; is a bright (think barbie)</li>
            <li> I was scared they would be too bright</li>
            <li> Just to bright for me.</li>
            <li> Also I did not receive that bright orange color</li>
            <li> But the colors are just too bright..</li>
            <li> Nyx is always a good brand.</li>

            <li> I was using some Korean brand lip liners and thought they were  good but</li>
            <li> The price was definitely good but not the product.</li>
            <li> Just doesn&#x27;t look good.</li>

            <li> and you&#x27;re good to go.</li>

            <li> Nice colors easy to apply and great value.</li>
            <li> Love the pigmentation of these colors, although they are bright</li>
            <li> NYX has amazing lip liners.</li>
            <li> they are amazing</li>
            <li> These are amazing, so pigmented and creamy, not to mention long-lasting.</li>
            <li> I already knew NYX products were great, so when I found these for so cheap</li>
            <li> but they weren&#x27;t a great fit for me with complexion.</li>
            <li> the colors are amazing.</li>
            <li> The lip liners are more bright colors.</li>
            <li> I honestly use these a lipsticks.</li>
            <li> The packaging of these pencils do not match my own Nyx pencils.</li>
            <li> arrived ahead of schedule which was nice</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good more then</li>
            <li> kind of an impulse buy.</li>
            <li> I purchased these to go with some of the lipsticks I own.</li>
            <li> This is a great price for such wonderful lip colors!!</li>
            <li> They can stand on their own, or be combined to make a personalized color.</li>
            <li> My wife liked the set and that is what counts.</li>
            <li> This is a really nice set, and for the price, you can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
            <li> I liked them so much that my best friend ordered some as well.</li>
            <li> the colors show up nice.</li>
            <li> These pencils are nice.</li>
            <li> Some are nice colors others not so nice</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll try my best to describe the colors if anyone wants to take the time to read through this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Nice lip liners in multi colors.</li>
            <li> Looks so beautiful as a full lipstick or just outline...</li>
            <li> Nice selection of colors, but the colors are all on the lighter side.</li>
            <li> but i liked them a lot .</li>
            <li> but I didnt find colors that nice</li>
            <li> Colors are nice.</li>
            <li> I love these liners and there really good if you don&#x27;t have the time or money to buy matching lipstick/gloss to just put it all over the lips.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to be completely honest here: I have no idea why I bought lip liner.</li>
            <li> I own all MAC lipsticks but not any MAC lip liners.  </li>
            <li> Ok,... There really good .</li>
            <li> I love NYX products always affordable and easy to work with!!</li>
            <li> What impressed me most was how fast the shipping was, though!</li>
            <li> This is a surprisingly great alternative that offers a smooth application and wonderful coverage that stays!</li>
            <li> These are great inexpensive lip liners that last surprisingly well and have a very rich bright color selection!  </li>
            <li> Super great deal for the price.</li>
            <li> I loved the colors and easy to apply.</li>

            <li> I love the colors I was sent.</li>
            <li> Love me and why ask lip pencil</li>
            <li> Love the variety of colors.</li>
            <li> In love with this</li>
            <li> in fact its better than some of the M.A.C that I have .</li>
            <li> Of course you can find better but to start off and not pay an arm and leg</li>
            <li> The colors are ok.</li>
            <li> Would have preferred more neutral colors in this pack.</li>
            <li> But they&#x27;re ok.</li>
            <li> I love the colors by the way.</li>
            <li> I love these colors, except the pencil can be a bit drying on the lips.</li>
            <li> I like the nyx retractable liners better because theyre more moisturizing.</li>
            <li> Although I love their lipsticks and lipliner, it hurt my wallet to break out $15 every time my favorite lipliner ran out.</li>
            <li> I immediately fell in love.</li>
            <li> but mostly I just use fuchsia.</li>
            <li> I would use for sure.</li>
            <li> , I just wish the colors were more usable.</li>
            <li> but I love more pink,nude colors.</li>
            <li> Love color and pigment</li>
            <li> I love the colors.</li>
            <li> so I am Pleased.</li>
            <li> and i love the variety of colors.</li>
            <li> and I love the matte colors.</li>
            <li> Thus, I ordered the set because I liked the colors and was hopeful that they were as pigmented and applied as smoothly as some reviewers reported.      </li>
            <li> and i love them.</li>
            <li> They do stay on most of the day, but I like to reapply after I eat.</li>
            <li> So I think it really was a great purchase.</li>
            <li> they are OK.</li>
            <li> they are perfect and when they are finished i am definitely ordering again!</li>
            <li> I love the saturation of color from these lip liner pencils.  </li>
            <li> Im more of a matte look person so</li>
            <li> Theyre the nude one and the light orange one.&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise!</li>
            <li> Coloures were also ok.</li>
            <li> Just got my lip pencils an IM in love</li>

            <li> but It was a good price for 4 and very fast shipping two days.</li>
            <li> They were delivered quick and I just LOVE the colors !</li>
            <li> Pretty colors, good pigmentation, not as creamy as I would like</li>
            <li> Also the statements about them being too liquidly make no sense because they are lip liner pencils and have a good consistent quality,</li>
            <li> good dealing and the shipment exactly as described</li>
            <li> Good quality, pretty colors.</li>

            <li> I really like the colors, and how it does not look too bright or out of place on me.</li>
            <li> I felt that it looked more of a light and wasn&#x27;t concentrated to the point where it matched my lipsticks.</li>
            <li> These go on smooth and I love the packaging.</li>
            <li> Again in pictures they look pretty bright but in reality they r too light.</li>
            <li> Shipping was faster then expected and the liners are great!</li>
            <li> There better than the cheap beauty supply brands.</li>
            <li> Especially love 2 pink colors.</li>

            <li> Fast delivery and good product&lt;br /&gt;Thxxxx</li>
            <li> These are very opaque and stay put for a good while.</li>
            <li> Great lip pencils for the price.... not dark and stays where you line your lips!  </li>
            <li> I have just one color now and love it so much that I want more colors... and what a deal!</li>
            <li> I love my lip liners, arrived on time, so cheap, really usefull products, finally I love the colors because are so trendy, the shades are variable,</li>

            <li> They glide on easily have somewhat of a creamy feeling.</li>
            <li> I love NYX brand, and was expecting something great, and I definitely received it!!!</li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> they are easily transportable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> /&gt;These NYX liners are easy to apply because they practically glide across the lip - no drying out or tugging.</li>
            <li> Just as good as high end lip liners.  </li>
            <li> Although, I found that the colors are all great for summer and are very in fashion right now.</li>
            <li> Very good quality, although I wouldn&#x27;t mind if their colour was more intense and not that soft</li>
            <li> I liked that there were so many colors to choose from, however a couple of them have a real orange tint to them that isn&#x27;t flattering at all to my light skin tone.  </li>
            <li> I love these lip liners...extremely true to color.  </li>
            <li> I actually ended up LOVING the Rose color the most.</li>
            <li> I bought these because the colors looked so beautiful and when I received them they definitely were</li>
            <li> Always purchased the warm set of lip liners from this brand also, so much cheaper than buying them separately from the original website!</li>
            <li> smooth texture vibrant color  and a good value.</li>
            <li> They  came in good condition and brand new.</li>
            <li> Slim and easy to fit in a pocket or purse</li>
            <li> Wow the colors are true to the picture packaging was great</li>
            <li> even somebody who has no idea what they&#x27;re doing can still do it just fine.</li>
            <li> I find these work just fine</li>
            <li> Receive the package quickly !</li>
            <li> The pack comes with a great variety of colors, making it very easy for me to match these lip liners with other brands as well.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, and I love the colors!</li>
            <li> The price is extremely reasonable, so I look forward to eventually purchasing more!</li>
            <li> Very pretty colors!</li>
            <li> They are really rich so they are easy to blend, but if you apply acouple of layers you can still manage to get an ombre.</li>
            <li> Once I got them I was super excited to try every color on!</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth and overall great piece to my makeup collection Compairable to my Mac lip liners.</li>
            <li> there creamy and smooth on the lips.</li>
            <li> I enjoy all of the NYX cosmetic line.</li>
            <li> I blot and lightly powder this liner, stays on all day.</li>
            <li> They go on smoothly and stay on.</li>
            <li> I was hoping to lightly line my lips and use lipgloss</li>
            <li> Overall, great products.</li>
            <li> I enjoy this product.</li>
            <li> The liners are really smooth and creamy.</li>
            <li> They are pigmented and smooth.</li>
            <li> The price is also cheap.</li>
            <li> They were really happy with and have been using it regularly.</li>
            <li> Obviously not as pigmented as others but great price.</li>
            <li> of course I use a lip conditioner before I apply them but they are smooth pencils</li>
            <li> The light purple is too light as well.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Dolly Pink/ Rose Poupee&amp;#34; is a bright light purple with a bit of pink color.</li>
            <li> Got these on time and the colors are fantastic.</li>
            <li> My favorite is Orange which is the most beautiful red that looks great alone, Pinky, a pretty magenta that looks awesome under pink lipstick, and Tangerine, a satin-finish nude pink that is amazing with a clear gloss ontop.</li>
            <li> Fantastic deal</li>
            <li> I like the others but, but they are a bit light.</li>
            <li> and I think, especially for the $$, that these are great.  </li>
            <li> but I must say it just feels cheap.</li>
            <li> Nyx has a great reputation with quality products to back it up.  </li>
            <li> These are great lip liners, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> The ones I ordered do NOT apply smoothly at all.  </li>
            <li> NYX is a great brand, definitely would recommend.</li>
            <li> The pencil is not creamy and does not glid smoothly.</li>
            <li> Love the fun colors and they stay on so well.</li>
            <li> nyx isn&#x27;t the most amazing quality in general but these pencils has a strong wood smell, which is distracting when applying to lips.</li>
            <li> less a must have ! ♥</li>
            <li> Love the range of colors and the price is right.</li>
            <li> Such a great brand and these pencils have great pigmentation and as long as you mosturize your lips before applying they go on smoothly.</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s more important is that the price was very reasonable.</li>
            <li> They sharpen super easily, The color lasts all day.</li>
            <li> I purchased these liners cuz I have purchased other NYX products and had very good results, specially their blushes.</li>
            <li> Wish there were a little more choices for colors, considering I have much darker skin, still awesome, would buy again.</li>
            <li> I fell in love with every single lip liner and the colors stayed on thru a good duration of time before having to reapply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love these so much!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m very pleased with them so far.</li>
            <li> I was so excited after reading these reviews</li>
            <li> I love all the colors and they look so pretty and work so well with my skin tone</li>
            <li> Theyre the best purchase I have ever made from NYX, usually I dont wear lip liners but these changed my mind.</li>
            <li> Also, I originally purchased it specifically because of the orange liner.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to get this Lip liner set, but all my excitement wore off when I got them.</li>
            <li> Its totally worth buying!</li>
            <li> , they&#x27;re thinner, kinda like a eye liner, but that is to be expected with viewing something on a screen, but a great price for 6 liners, the colors are pretty nice, but all very similar, &amp; as some others mentioned in there reviews kinda neon-like colors very bright &amp; as I said very close to one another, I sometimes bright neon colors, so this is fine for me but maybe not suited for other&#x27;s taste</li>
            <li> I also pull out the lipliner over full lips and add transparent gloss on top of it which makes look as though i have applied that particular color lipstick which is great, u dont need to buy different shades of glosses or lipsticks.</li>
            <li> By far my favorite lip liners!</li>
            <li> The  colors are perfect and each lip liner gives a unique look to the face,i am a naive user</li>
            <li> These are the best because I&#x27;ve used different brands and these products are super soft.</li>
            <li> orange is so bright and vivid and looks just like a reddish orange and the pink dolly is so bright and reminds me of Nicki manaj lips or whatnot.</li>
            <li> I will be purchasing more of them Great little gift!</li>
            <li> This product and NYX brand in general are reasonably priced for a great value.</li>
            <li> there are 2 colors that looks similar to one another like orange and tangerine except tangerine isn&#x27;t as bright</li>
            <li> Great quality a wide variety of colors</li>
            <li> The packaging is good and arrived earlier.</li>
            <li> The price is really good, especially considering to find colors like these</li>
            <li> Only two of the colors are good for using-Orange and Pinky.</li>
            <li> (but I go for more modern colors...)</li>
            <li> I really like most of these colors.</li>
            <li> colors are true to color on end.</li>
            <li> and I love NYX but together not so much.</li>
            <li> this set of lip liner are just what I needed, it is soft and glided nicely on my lips ..</li>
            <li> i love the colors and it stays on really will</li>
            <li> Overall good product.</li>
            <li> thanks for they :)</li>
            <li> As stated in my caption, this is only for the pink and coral tones which is great for the summer and still good for your collection in winter.</li>
            <li> Not bad.</li>
            <li> These are super cool Lip pencil.</li>
            <li> Having a large variety of Lip Liners really come in handy.  </li>
            <li> Other than that the quality is great.</li>
            <li> Great lip liners that end up matching other non NYX lipsticks that I have, even my ruby woo lipstick from MAC matches the pencils.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Other than that the arrival time was great.</li>
            <li> They came in super quick as well.</li>
            <li> Its nice to try a variety of colors to test out for such a cheap price.</li>
            <li> I love that I got so many different colors</li>
            <li> nice and lovely as expected by my wife.</li>
            <li> The delivery was quick.</li>
            <li> This purchase came in the mail pretty quickly!</li>
            <li> shipping was quick and everything was wrapped well.</li>
            <li> The products arrived quickly and well-packaged.</li>
            <li> These are great to experiment with if you&#x27;re new to lipliners, or makeup in general!</li>
            <li> The glad very soft &amp; soomth to the touch!</li>
            <li> These are a million times better than the high end,</li>
            <li> I also was expecting the orange shade to be more orange-ish, but upon arrival it was very muted.&lt;br /&gt;All 6 pencils go on very creamy, smooth, and true matte.</li>
            <li> After those long nights out when I get in and K.O. without taking my makeup off, this lip liner is STILL in place and bright when I wake up.</li>
            <li> Great color turnout, stays on pretty long, lots of fun colors.</li>
            <li> but egh tht are still very pretty</li>
            <li> Not only did they arrive super fast... but the color pay off is amazing!</li>
            <li> Mostly because of the price, but also, I have never even heard of NYX makeup, so it was all new to me.  </li>
            <li> So maybe if anything I will love a new lip look that I thought I would never wear.</li>
            <li> Great buy you save about $2 for each lip liner and it arrived in less than 5 days.</li>
            <li> Super fun lip linnets for spring and summer.</li>
            <li> up.&lt;br /&gt;These colors are perfect, you can sharpen these pencils, meaning they last long...</li>
            <li> Not as good as a Mac lip liner if your looking for that quality of a liner, they are not creamy if your looking for a creamy lip liner, there kinda dry</li>
            <li> Very happy with product and will deffinately recommend and it last long n ur lips luv it</li>
            <li> Will be back for more!</li>
            <li> so pretty!</li>
            <li> All pretty!</li>
            <li> colors are hot!</li>
            <li> so i can not compare its excellence with other liners but for me for the first use it did a great job.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it , colors are very true to pics</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s very creamy and slides on the lips smooth.</li>
            <li> I think the Pinks are amazing, the red and oranges I rarely use.</li>
            <li> I had read the reviews for this set of NYX pencils, and while most said they liked them, the ones who didn&#x27;t were quite adamant, leaving specific reasons why.  </li>
            <li> It worth buying</li>
            <li> something I probably would have never tried otherwise, but actually ended up loving.</li>
            <li> I was hoping for more natural hues, but what I got was basically neon colors.  </li>
            <li> but for the price it was worth giving these a shot.</li>
            <li> the 2nd one is kind of goldish</li>
            <li> For the price I think they are worth the money.</li>
            <li> you get your money&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li> I was surprised, watch the type of lip stick because it makes the lips stand out more</li>
            <li> I was a little, err, ok, a LOT, surprised by these FABULOUS lip liners!!!  </li>
            <li> Just like the other liners I ordered, I love NYX make up and will order more once I run out.</li>
            <li> ;) , that goes for bold lips.</li>
            <li> Of course the orange one is NO for me but the purple pink and the brownsih pink look pretty good on and the pigment is really good</li>
            <li> All of the colors are great and what is a major plus is that i now have a liner match for all six of my individual &amp;</li>
            <li> sharpening can be a bit of a challenge but other than that they are all good</li>
            <li> Other than that, its a good product.</li>
            <li> usually stick with Mac bc of the color selection and pigmentation of the colors, or Revlon Colorstay lip-liner in nude because it honestly stays on all day, and is complimentary to many lipsticks and</li>
            <li> I scooped them right up.</li>
            <li> but I do have fun having barbie lips today and it looked good with my dark hair.</li>
            <li> Over all I&#x27;am pleased with this purchase for the price but on the other hand a tad bit dissapointed because the colors look so much different than when you put them on &amp; it should state that they are bright &amp; bold and neon types.</li>
            <li> lip liners are significantly longer (in physical length), so there is more product, but they are also sold at a higher price point.</li>
            <li> Smooth, highly pigmented lip pencils.  </li>
            <li> I have tried many different pencils before and so far these are my favorite ones.</li>
            <li> Color didn&#x27;t stay on long, but nice colors</li>
            <li> The color lasts all day and are very vibrant!</li>
            <li> These are a little smaller than what I thought but perfect</li>
            <li> less bright (not neon) but still not a practical color.</li>
            <li> /&gt;According to her all colors are nice, and they last much longer compared to others.</li>
            <li> great quality liners especially if  you&#x27;re starting a kit.</li>
            <li> I outline and fill in my lips then apply a nude gloss…viola, new color!!!</li>
            <li> and they went on smooth and felt very soft.</li>
            <li> This is not my first time purchasing from this seller, they ship super fast.</li>
            <li> It was very much needed.</li>
            <li> thank you so much , very fast shipment&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
            <li> They are nice but they make my lips very dry.</li>
            <li> Some of them are nice and creamy and some are very dry.</li>
            <li> /&gt;These colors are highly pigmented and not subdued at all if you&#x27;re more of a natural person.</li>
            <li> They are quite pigmentented, can&#x27;t beat the price, and shipping time is really fast!</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re really creamy, and they just glide on!</li>
            <li> this is the first time.</li>
            <li> I think they are of great quality and the last for a really long time.</li>
            <li> Love NXY, would definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> All of the colors are really pretty.</li>
            <li> Great colors and long lasting.</li>
            <li> I rushed straight to the bath room and tried all of the colors one after another!  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t mind reapplying ;)</li>
            <li> well first of i wanna say i like these lip colors and their well pigmented</li>
            <li> i can rock them.....;)</li>
            <li> they really changed my view on lip liners!</li>
            <li> Colors are pretty.</li>
            <li> you may want to put lip balm first.</li>
            <li> I had to do several rounds of this before I was able to put on my lipstick</li>
            <li> , remember they don&#x27;t have to match the lipstick shade exactly.</li>
            <li> They arrived 3 days after I purchased them, 4 days before the first day of the delivery estimate.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve moved on to higher quality products.</li>
            <li> pretty colors wish there were some nudes and purples</li>
            <li> color &amp;#34;Orange&amp;#34; is more of a red with orange undertones.</li>
            <li> the ones that come in the group are pretty.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I tried Nyx anything</li>
            <li> I guess it depends on what your skin is like and what your willing to do to make them work.</li>
            <li> First of all, you must apply lip balm for the color to even go on, not creamy at all.</li>
            <li> like I expected bit if you mix them they can be nice colored</li>
            <li> Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Quality of these NYX lip liners is most similar, in my opinion, to MACs lip-liners.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> In fact, I often use them for my whole lip or even on my eyes!</li>
            <li> A good way to get a few colors of NYX liners to try.</li>
            <li> the colors are vivid and worth getting if you many colors and wouldn&#x27;t mind a little more.</li>
            <li> They wear very well and the colors are just right for summer or fall.  </li>
            <li> Definitely worth the buy if you need some new lip liners!</li>
            <li> It does not feel good and the colors are not very nice.</li>
            <li> I realize some of the reviews for this were good and bad, but I loved the product.</li>
            <li> I bought this lot only because of the color dolly pink and because it was a great deal also</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not a big fan of big brand names, just good quality.</li>
            <li> Applies well and stays pretty much all day.</li>
            <li> I am wearing Dolly Pink today, and it goes perfect with the 901B by Wet n&#x27; Wild.</li>
            <li> I give it 4 stars only because the colors seem more vibrant in pictures</li>
            <li> Other than that they are very easy to apply.</li>
            <li> so don&#x27;t except super soft lips</li>
            <li> so if bright neon colors are not your thing this buy will be a waste for you, now the colors go on nice &amp; the color stay on a decent amount of time, but not long lasting all day, but I do like them</li>
            <li> I love these and use them every single day.</li>
            <li> A good range of colors for someone with very pale skin, like me.</li>
            <li> The colors are a bit too much in the photos but looks more normal in the actual product.</li>
            <li> My lips are very sensitive to most lip products and this is the only brand I&#x27;ve found that I can wear without irritation.</li>
            <li> I live NYX and these lip liners are quality; they are alays a staple in my very large make up bag.</li>
            <li> I gave it a 4-star rating because it would be nice to have them be a little creamier and easier to apply.</li>
            <li> I really love every single color!</li>
            <li> I sometimes just use these to add a little color &amp; then top with a light clear gloss or balm.</li>
            <li> plus there very affordable.</li>
            <li> Thanks for amAzon.</li>
            <li> I am very please with this.</li>
            <li> Eyelinera are pigmented, full size, long lasting and who doesn&#x27;t love variety of colors.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a real</li>
            <li> I really like these lip liners.  </li>
            <li> I will always ready to shop with them again ...</li>
            <li> really to hide the pigmentation of my lip color</li>
            <li> They were really affordable.</li>
            <li> Delivery was fast.</li>
            <li> They do seem very cakey.</li>
            <li> I guess I have really pigmented lips, so the lighter colors don&#x27;t really show up on my lips.</li>
            <li> isn&#x27;t really hotpink</li>
            <li> Arrived fast</li>
            <li> the pencils are very well pigmented</li>
            <li> I really do recommend this to all girl, all ages</li>
            <li> and I really like them.</li>
            <li> Thanks u so much.</li>
            <li> and it didn&#x27;t blend very well.</li>
            <li> Maybe it was knock off of the real NYX  lip liner I don&#x27;t know.</li>
            <li> and I really like the colors, very versatile and can work with just about any color</li>
            <li> I really expected more from this brand.</li>
            <li> THANKS</li>
            <li> and I am VERY impress, you can use this lip liners with your lipstick- lip gloss or use your lip balm and use them as a filler.&lt;br /&gt;They</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Pinky/Rose&amp;#34; reminds me a lot of the &amp;#34;Sand Pink/Sable Rose&amp;#34; except more pink in tone than purple.&lt;br</li>
            <li> These were really drying on my lips and when I rubbed my lips together they just wouldn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> i didn&#x27;t really expect these colors</li>
            <li> these liners are very pigmented.</li>
            <li> The colors are too light and don&#x27;t last</li>
            <li> She sent me the correct color at a very speedy process</li>
            <li> I would highly suggest them!</li>
            <li> the two pencils that were shimmer-ish dont really suit me.</li>
            <li> I occasionally wear the liner on it&#x27;s own by filling in the entire lip, giving a light matte look that really does last all night.  </li>
            <li> They are great lip liners and came in quickly the only reason I gave it four stars are because it doesn&#x27;t include any darker colored liners for red or dark lipsticks.</li>
            <li> I have found that they are long wearing and are great for preventing color bleeding when wearing red lipsticks especially.</li>
            <li> I love the other colors for the lip liners</li>
            <li> They look amazing and last long enough.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li> NYX Cosmetics Long Lasting Slim Lip Liner Pencils 6 Colors are amazing.</li>
            <li> If your lips are dry, I would recommend softening them up with a lip balm before applying these because they will get a little dry/chalky feeling and not look as great.  </li>
            <li> nice, colors, but they are all pretty similar to each other.</li>
            <li> Mac Lip Liners, I decided I would save them for special occasions and find a cheaper alternative for daily use.  </li>
            <li> I expected a little bit more better quality from these.</li>
            <li> the only thing is that they are kind of dry</li>
            <li> They are the exact colors from the picture and came early.</li>
            <li> Once you manage to have it on, the color still won&#x27;t fully cover your lips, you can always put a similar color lipstick on for full coverage.</li>
            <li> Then I think rose and that other pink shade are similar as well and one is more vivid and bright and the other is a tone or two down but they are sooooooo PRETTY!</li>
            <li> The only reason these get 4 stars is the colors were just a little too bright for my taste.</li>
            <li> Anything black I think looks really elegant.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know if they&#x27;re an older style of packaging or knock offs.</li>
            <li> The only thing is the color doesn&#x27;t last more than 3-4 hours...</li>
            <li> The colors are really very pretty, which is the only reason why I would give three stars if any.</li>
            <li> Other than the orange, the colors were very vibrant.&lt;br /&gt;All 6 pencils last a very long time, and look great just by themselves.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> The shipping was fast, and right when i got it i instantly tried everyone on.</li>
            <li> soft and smooth, glides easily on my lips, last longer than my other lip liners and the colors</li>
            <li> this price, I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend these liners.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this set.</li>
            <li> longlasting and high pigmented</li>
            <li> , I have my high end make up &amp;</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> But the picture is high in contrast</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> These pencils are of high quality, and high pigment.  </li>
            <li> Matches all of my pink and coral lipsticks just fine.  </li>
            <li> so far it&#x27;s very vibrant and eye-catching.</li>
            <li> The color choices are nice and not too similar to each other.</li>
            <li> Wish they were just a little more softer when you put them on your lips.</li>
            <li> I will say that the pencil, overall, looks pretty in the drawer!    </li>
            <li> light pink.</li>
            <li> Performs as pencil lip liners are expected to perform, colors are accurate.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that they&#x27;re not as creamy as I would have liked, so there is a bit of tug when applying, but I still think they&#x27;re worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> but then the colors useful are only 3 in the package.</li>
            <li> ever since I was told that I&#x27;ve been having fun with different colors for the summer.</li>
            <li> I do like these colors but 3 of them are so light and similar that you could barely see the color.</li>
            <li> There are 6 colors and only two of them are useful...</li>
            <li> The color stays quite long and no bad scent at all.</li>
            <li> More than half the cost at Ulta!  </li>
            <li> I like the more pale ones.</li>
            <li> I have wanted Nyx cosmetics ever since I saw &amp;#34;Ru Pauls Drag Race.&amp;#34;  I was so excited when I opened the package</li>
            <li> The other colors are too light for me.  </li>
            <li> If your new to make up this set is for you.</li>
            <li> They are a lot smaller than I expected (the pictures make them look more like chubby sticks</li>
            <li> the nice pink one is not mauvy pink</li>
            <li> Their pigmentation is strong, and when applied to, and worn on my lips, the pigment lasts a typical amount of time for lip liners that are not classified as &amp;</li>
            <li> It didnt take to long to arrive and I got exactly what I paid for !</li>
            <li> The others two light orange i find pretty similar to each other</li>
            <li> Easy to apply and long lasting.</li>
            <li> Worth the buy and long wearing.  </li>
            <li> Soft lip liners!  </li>
            <li> The colors are so vivid.  </li>
            <li> Wet &amp; wild is similar quality for cheaper as well, more product, and isn&#x27;t as drying.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re affordable and you usually get more than what you pay for .</li>
            <li> I had lots of different lip glosses and sticks that matches them pretty well.</li>
            <li> Also, I got exactly the colors it shows above .</li>
            <li> I did like 2 out of the 6 but first of all they weren&#x27;t close to the color on the tip and 2nd</li>
            <li> But two of them are almost exactly the same and</li>
            <li> My favorite, so far is a pink with blue undertones called &amp;#34;Dolly.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> shade range is great, the only one missing is a deep red</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t really like it and the one that appears hot pink</li>
            <li> A couple are very light and hard to see.</li>
            <li> They may be slightly more pigmented than those 99-cent Wet &#x27;N Wild pencils, but what good does that do when they are dry and difficult to apply at all?  </li>
            <li> I have some cheap other lips pencils that last hours and this one doesnt last more than half hour without correction.</li>
            <li> The colors are not very vivid and don&#x27;t exactly match up to the color you would think you were using.</li>
            <li> colors are different, so some people might have experienced a packaging issue or they might be color blind.</li>
            <li> I like to put a clear Chapstick over them like an eos.</li>
            <li> Seems old and color is not pigmented.</li>
            <li> They just complete all of my make up looks.</li>
            <li> The colors weren&#x27;t as natural as they should&#x27;ve been.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really natural on my skin tone, which is what I wanted.</li>
            <li> wow</li>
            <li> for me not a total bust &amp; I will make use of them &amp; a fast ship..</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t have to use much so these should last me a while.</li>
            <li> I thought there were repeated colors, but once I tried them they really are different shades.</li>
            <li> I often find my self directing people to amazon to purchase these pencils because of the frequent questions and compliments.</li>
            <li> I will be passing these along to my young niece for her play makeup kit.  </li>
            <li> I like the natural colors in this product.</li>
            <li> so I can fill in the brown outline I naturally have.</li>
            <li> have used many lip liners from various high-end brands, as well as quite a few from Revlon and L&#x27;oreal (Target or Drug Store Brand).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> you don&#x27;t have to buy expensive products to look good and this is an example of practical items you must have</li>
            <li> They are good quality but the colors are almost the same , I am not happy with my purchase</li>
            <li> However, they are nice colors other than that little tidbit.</li>
            <li> My only challenge is pulling this particular set of colors off with pigmented lips.</li>
            <li> I love NYX products for the most part, but I was kinda disappointed when I used these.</li>
            <li> You can always blot the color a bit and apply some lip balm (if you don&#x27;t like the dry feel since it&#x27;s very Matte applied alone) to achieve a more subtle look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I do like the two that are a hot pink color.  </li>
            <li> but I would not say overly dry, do not expect them to be as large as they look on the ad</li>
            <li> OK, sounds weird, but I&#x27;m really close with my Grandma</li>
            <li> Very pigmented and long lasting.  </li>
            <li> They are very pigmented and last long</li>
            <li> Very creamy and long lasting.</li>
            <li> These came in SO fast, and the quality is amazingly long lasting under lipstick.</li>
            <li> These weren&#x27;t bad, kind of sheer but overall not bad colors.</li>
            <li> they are long lasting and hold up very well.</li>
            <li> all of them are very pigmented and have a wide range of colors.</li>
            <li> but this is not possible, as you cannot blend neon colors into your natural lip.  </li>
            <li> I will be using them in the near future.</li>
            <li> The color &amp;#34;Sand Pink/Sable Rose&amp;#34; Is a midton-pink leaning towards the purpley side, The color &amp;#34;Rose&amp;#34; is straight mid-tone pink.</li>
            <li> I bought the lip liners for a young lady starting out being a makeup artist.</li>
            <li> These are pretty generic lipliners in harder to find colors.</li>
            <li> The colors in this set are pretty, but very similar to each other.  </li>
            <li> The only stuff I normally use on my lips is lip balm, because I am a French horn performance student and anything with colour on it automatically wipes off onto my horn mouthpiece, not to mention that I don&#x27;t actually know how to put on lip liner.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> I guess, not much of a dry feeling.</li>
            <li> I do wish they were a little more smoother and less dry tho.</li>
            <li> Like other name brand cosmetics companies, they have a wide arrangement of proud st, but not at the expensive name brand price.  </li>
            <li> Terrible, - very light for a very light person.  </li>
            <li> It is absolutely not long lasting at all!!!</li>
            <li> but it is not really long lasting</li>
            <li> But they are not long lasting at all.  </li>
            <li> Not long lasting at all.</li>
            <li> very stiff, kind of hard to put on</li>
            <li> I was quite disappointed in this set, since I&#x27;m generally pleased with NYX products as a whole.  </li>
            <li> These liners are long lasting, however don&#x27;t expect them to last all day.  </li>
            <li> The rest of the color were &amp;#34; barely pink and barely noticeable&amp;#34;, unless you are vampire with a chalky white lips.</li>
            <li> The only reason I would give this product a 4.5 instead of a 5 is because I wish there was one color that was a true nude or nude w a very small hint of pink, included in these for versatility.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never enjoyed wearing makeup as much as I do now.</li>
            <li> \\&quot; NYX Cosmetics Long Lasting Slim Lip Liner Pencils 6 Colors]&lt;br /&gt;All</li>
            <li> Long Lasting (no kidding</li>
            <li> Just beware the quality is very low and the look is not professional or even close ... but it does go on and stay there.</li>
            <li> They are long lasting.</li>
            <li> It lasts long enough for me.</li>
            <li> and also they DONT last long.</li>
            <li> They also last a long time.</li>
            <li> Long lasting color.</li>
            <li> i haven&#x27;t worn them long enough to test durability, but i will say this...for the price...</li>
            <li> They are highly pigmented but not terribly easy to apply.</li>
            <li> I paid a full price for half of the product!!!!</li>
            <li> I found these pencils to be so dry they actually hurt as I applied them on my lips</li>
            <li> They could be used all over the lips as well however don&#x27;t forget to apply lip balm on top or as a base because they are very drying.</li>
            <li> My only issue with these liners is that they dont last like other liners.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s not supposed to be soft and smear, and it is supposed to be a little harder than regular lipstick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All</li>
            <li> I&#x27;VE TRIED JUST ABOUT EVER LIP LINER ON THE MARKET--FROM DIRT CHEAP TO RELATIVELY EXPENSIVE.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t stay as long as I like</li>
            <li> but there is only one reddish lip pencil and the rest are varying shades of pink.</li>
            <li> Not soft pinks or reds.</li>
            <li> but instead I got another pack of different pink- brownish lip liners.</li>
            <li> Only thing is that i wish the colors werent so silmilar to each other.</li>
            <li> With some other lip liners I&#x27;ve tried the color on the lips doesn&#x27;t actually match the color of the liner.  </li>
            <li> but you can mixed them with other lipstick colors and it does the job.</li>
            <li> need such set in other colours too</li>
            <li> and they dry out your lips a bit, but they do the trick in a pinch if you want some color.</li>
            <li> But it emphasizes dry lips and if they are moisturized, still tends to make them look dry?</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like them, they make your lips so dry</li>
            <li> They were dry</li>
            <li> I found two of them really dry.</li>
            <li> its so dry on your lips</li>
            <li> It was that dry.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t even come up with the words to explain how dry.</li>
            <li> Beware liner and ALL liner will make your lips look dry</li>
            <li> I loved these but hated that there was no red color</li>
            <li> , however I need it something other than red and pink, so I gave it a go</li>
            <li> These NYX lip liners stay on all day long!!  </li>
            <li> There isn&#x27;t a taste from the NYX lip liners but a slight taste from the actual lip sticks matte finish.</li>
            <li> I have to say that while these pencils aren&#x27;t the worst I&#x27;ve experienced, they are somewhat close.  </li>
            <li> The oranges were not very wearable and there is 2 of them in there.</li>
            <li> I got the colors: 840 rose,835 pinky, 846 tangerine, 824 orange, 839 Dolly pink, and 841 coral.  </li>
            <li> but what I expected</li>
            <li> The package came sooner than I expected and every lip liner was just as pictured.</li>
            <li> they are low quality and the line is harsh and almost like drawing with pencil on my face.</li>
            <li> At 1st I was upset because I recieved two of the same colors and was missing one of the colors</li>
            <li> Colors are lighter than expected, but maybe bc my skin tone is on the darker/olive side.</li>
            <li> use them under lipstick as a base or on their own.</li>
            <li> The formula is very dry!  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s barbie pink like the other one but</li>
            <li> They all go well with almost all of my other lipsticks.</li>
            <li> so it looks like there would be other shades and there aren&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not old or dried out</li>
            <li> Indeed, it can feel dry during application but all you need is a little lip balm (I use EOS)</li>
            <li> The application is a little rough.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not particularly orange, more like a dark/orangy pink, very ugly.</li>
            <li> and they were just not worth buying.</li>
            <li> I dont love or either hate it.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s a tone or two down.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to wear the other ones!</li>
            <li> These pencils were insanely affordable and one was actually a dupe for my favorite mac lip liner.</li>
            <li> but theyre very subtle and soft.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ll explain why it&#x27;s not good) lip pencils in several colors.</li>
            <li> I normally wear Estee Lauder, Lancome or MAC, and as you know they are quite expensive, but also, you still always have to touch them up throughout the day/night.  </li>
            <li> a little too dry and hard..</li>
            <li> But it do make my lips try a little bit.</li>
            <li> I may not used them all during fall or winter days, unless I&#x27;m looking for a little extravagant look.</li>
            <li> Even when I did just a little lip gloss, it just seemed to disappear.</li>
            <li> There is little pigmentation.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> I use them almost everyday</li>
            <li> And when I put this pencil on my lip it dried out my lip and the shade was gone in 5mintes</li>
            <li> I usually wear down the tip a bit by moving it over some Kleenex-</li>
            <li> , NC25 is way too pale and the summer I am</li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t spend mad money on high end products like I used to.</li>
            <li> they are a little hard to work with.</li>
            <li> but they are rather small.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve recently become obsessed with the NYX cosmetics.</li>
            <li> They are small.</li>
            <li> too lazy to return</li>
            <li> I wear one everyday!</li>
            <li> but they were the small skinny ones</li>
            <li> Not very good quality</li>
            <li> GARISH COLORS AND HARD PENCIL POINT</li>
            <li> you can&#x27;t hardly see the line</li>
            <li> If you are one of those girls that have a hard time trying to match your lipsticks with the pencils, then you should consider purchasing these.  </li>
            <li> Warming up the sticks only results in awkward application.</li>
            <li> I knew there would be at least one out of six that I would probably continue using....</li>
            <li> I  thought at least 4out of the 6</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a make-up snob in the past, but times are tough</li>
            <li> After spending a ridiculous $60+ on four MakeUpForever/</li>
            <li> Not a good purchase for me.</li>
            <li> Hard to find the correct pencil sharpener though, as some of the sharpeners, make the pencil disintegrate!</li>
            <li> but then I tried them on and you could hardly see them!</li>
            <li> Ladies, if you&#x27;re second guessing on whether to buy it or not, you definitely won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m addicted to makeup and had to have these lip pencils.</li>
            <li> Not really happy about the pencils</li>
            <li> I ordered these as a gift for a friend and the tips were broken.</li>
            <li> The reason why I&#x27;m giving it a 4 is because I was a little disappointed with the size of the pencils,</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t like them at all a waste of my money :(</li>
            <li> as I wrong.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a bit sad.</li>
            <li> Dontvfeel a bit guilty for have, I think,</li>
            <li> Do not buy such a horrible product!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I am not really impressed with the product.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately mine are being returned.</li>
            <li> and that could turn out weird</li>
            <li> I was looking for subtle neutral pinks and corals and was disappointed.</li>
            <li> unfortunately, these pencils are not good as it should be and even if you hate them up to take the liquid from them, it did not work for me at all.</li>
            <li> it don&#x27;t be afraid it&#x27;s exc</li>
            <li> so i wasn&#x27;t expecting anything bad with these lip liners.</li>
            <li> I have never been disappointed with any of their products.</li>
            <li> So disappointed</li>
            <li> Upon purchase, I thought that these pencils were retractable crayon-type liners, and I was a bit disappointed that they were just pencils.</li>
            <li> However, The colors didn&#x27;t work for me.. :(</li>
            <li> and I have been using them like crazy!</li>
            <li> I hate to throw them away, but they are not in my purse with others.</li>
            <li> Hated the pencils colors are off</li>
            <li> colors looks horrible.</li>
            <li> Terrible service provider.</li>
            <li> You can use all over your lip as lipstick but when my lips are chapped it looks awful.</li>
            <li> These are horrible colors!</li>
            <li> These were awful</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s terrible</li>
            <li> but 2 of them are sparkly and that looks horrible on me!</li>

            <li> Matches most shades of my lipstick collection. Applies well and stays pretty much all day. Keeps my lipstick from bleeding. I am a fan.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always love NYX products! so i wasn&#x27;t expecting anything bad with these lip liners. These lip liners are great! there creamy and smooth on the lips. plus there very affordable.</li>
            <li> Thank you for a great transaction!~  These liners are true to color!</li>
            <li> They are highly pigmented but not terribly easy to apply.</li>
            <li> I am trying to build up my makeup collections, so I had to have these. They are quite pigmentented, can&#x27;t beat the price, and shipping time is really fast! I ordered them on Saturday, and got them the following Wednesday. I am wearing Dolly Pink today, and it goes perfect with the 901B by Wet n&#x27; Wild. I can&#x27;t wait to wear the other ones!</li>
            <li> I love these lip liners. Not only did they arrive super fast... but the color pay off is amazing! If your looking for affordable lip liners here they are!</li>
            <li> they are a little hard to work with. Wish they were just a little more softer when you put them on your lips.</li>
            <li> NYX is an awesome product and I love them.  Worth the buy and long wearing.  I enjoy all of the NYX cosmetic line. Excellent.</li>
            <li> I am pleased with the assortment of pinks and oranges found in this set.  Matches all of my pink and coral lipsticks just fine.  Great value.</li>
            <li> great deal for the set price- awesome color combination, works well as a lipstick base, or even on its own!</li>
            <li> Yay I love them! Did not receive any colors that are the same so that&#x27;s a plus. Will order more when they finish</li>
            <li> I love these so much! I just got them today, and I&#x27;ve tried them all on. They&#x27;re really creamy, and they just glide on! I&#x27;m very impressed. Plus they got here in two days.</li>
            <li> Nyx is always a good brand. We use them at the salon I work at so I thought I&#x27;d try them and I&#x27;m very pleased with them so far.</li>
            <li> I love NYX&#x27;s cosmetics. Even though they are drug store, they are one of my go to&#x27;s and forever will be! I have never been disappointed with any of their products.</li>
            <li> I thought it would be a jumbo pencil but they are rather small. I like the colors and everything, I just wish they were jumbo</li>
            <li> Love my pencils. It worth buying and they goes on very smoothly on your lips.</li>
            <li> Awesome lipliner for it&#x27;s price. It&#x27;s a good deal ever! The packaging is good and arrived earlier. Thanks for amAzon. Com!</li>
            <li> All of it arrived melted</li>
            <li> I honestly use these a lipsticks. I apply it to my bottom lip and press my lips together and it performs like a matte lipstick. &amp;#60;3 Flawless.</li>
            <li> Excellent lip liner all the colors are very nice you could wear  them by it self or with your favor lip stick , great product I give them a 5+</li>
            <li> I order these for my daughter because she always told me that she like mines.  They wear very well and the colors are just right for summer or fall.  Great will order again</li>
            <li> These are a little smaller than what I thought but perfect all of them are very pigmented and have a wide range of colors. If your new to make up this set is for you. They came in super quick as well. I am very please with this.</li>
            <li> Excellent GIFT for your wife</li>
            <li> It is absolutely not long lasting at all!!! So disappointed</li>
            <li> They sharpen well, the color is just like photo, I&#x27;ve never bought NYX before, now I will, great product. I blot and lightly powder this liner, stays on all day.</li>
            <li> Love Nyx lip products</li>
            <li> \\&quot; NYX Cosmetics Long Lasting Slim Lip Liner Pencils 6 Colors]&lt;br /&gt;All colors looks horrible. Nothing like the colors on the site. Seems to be child brush drawing. They said that I can return and I paid to return the product and they didn&#x27;t gave me the money back, nothing! Any refund! They said the product was used. Terrible service provider. I lose my time and money. Never had a problem with anything I buy on amazon... this is the first time. \\&quot;</li>
            <li> This is not my first time purchasing from this seller, they ship super fast. Eyelinera are pigmented, full size, long lasting and who doesn&#x27;t love variety of colors. These are my very first NYX lip liners, and i am very happy with them.</li>
            <li> Love the pigmentation of these colors, although they are bright they are gorgeous</li>
            <li> I love the colors. They&#x27;re great. You can use all over your lip as lipstick but when my lips are chapped it looks awful. Otherwise I recommend I&#x27;ll buy them again</li>
            <li> These are great colors. I love the &#x27;matte&#x27; look of these.</li>
            <li> beautiful colors and creamy texture make these lip pencils great. Buy the set it&#x27;s a real bargain;every color is a beauty!</li>
            <li> These liners go on very smoothly and pack alot of color! Not only do i use these to line lips i use them to fill in lips as well like a lipstick!</li>
            <li> I must say i love this product this is really awesome.The  colors are perfect and each lip liner gives a unique look to the face,i am a naive user and i can surely say this is best for one of my kind.I have not got any lip liner earlier so i can not compare its excellence with other liners but for me for the first use it did a great job.I also pull out the lipliner over full lips and add transparent gloss on top of it which makes look as though i have applied that particular color lipstick which is great, u dont need to buy different shades of glosses or lipsticks.Even while using a sheer lipstick it better to fill the lip with lipliner which cover the openings in the lips and gives a perfect finishing.I think for beginner its a great product to play with.</li>
            <li> Ehh. I expected a little bit more better quality from these. They are nice but they make my lips very dry. Especially if I keep reapplying them.</li>
            <li> Seems old and color is not pigmented. The packaging of these pencils do not match my own Nyx pencils. Don&#x27;t know if they&#x27;re an older style of packaging or knock offs.</li>
            <li> I am a make-up freak.  I love these lip liners...extremely true to color.  Slim and easy to fit in a pocket or purse</li>
            <li> I love having all of these cute lip liners to play with. They just complete all of my make up looks. Buy them you will not regret it. They sharpen super easily, The color lasts all day. and you will look FABULOUS!</li>
            <li> NYX is the best.  Very pigmented and long lasting.  Matches with NYX and MAC colors, and even lip tars by OCC.</li>
            <li> These lip pencils are very good quality and I adored all of the different colors.  I prefer lip pencils to lipstick for definition and filling in.</li>
            <li> Upon purchase, I thought that these pencils were retractable crayon-type liners, and I was a bit disappointed that they were just pencils. I also was expecting the orange shade to be more orange-ish, but upon arrival it was very muted.&lt;br /&gt;All 6 pencils go on very creamy, smooth, and true matte. They do not ball up or cake at all. Other than the orange, the colors were very vibrant.&lt;br /&gt;All 6 pencils last a very long time, and look great just by themselves.&lt;br /&gt;For this price, I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Good inexpensive lip pencils that get the work done!!! Very satisfied with shipping as well!!!! Something else great to add to artist building their kits!!!</li>
            <li> NYX has amazing lip liners. They are really rich so they are easy to blend, but if you apply acouple of layers you can still manage to get an ombre. Only thing is that i wish the colors werent so silmilar to each other.</li>
            <li> I have tried many different pencils before and so far these are my favorite ones. They are very pigmented and last long</li>
            <li> These are the simplest you can get, but they&#x27;re in all colors and in a great price. I love these and use them every single day. They are awesome. Will definitely repurchase.</li>
            <li> These are great to experiment with if you&#x27;re new to lipliners, or makeup in general! Lots of options to pair with lipsticks or wear alone under gloss. My only challenge is pulling this particular set of colors off with pigmented lips.</li>
            <li> For the price, these are alright. Some of them are very bright. I like the more pale ones. I bought them to use as a lip color underneath a gloss or even chapstick. They don&#x27;t stay as long as I like and they dry out your lips a bit, but they do the trick in a pinch if you want some color.</li>
            <li> I really love these liners. I think they are of great quality and the last for a really long time. After those long nights out when I get in and K.O. without taking my makeup off, this lip liner is STILL in place and bright when I wake up. I use the pencils as a liner and I fill my lips in to build my lipsticks up and to keep them from running and they do the job perfectly. I&#x27;d recommend this brand to any girl ,or guy ;) , that goes for bold lips.</li>
            <li> Perfect. They are the exact colors from the picture and came early.</li>
            <li> arrived ahead of schedule which was nice and my daughter is happy with the product</li>
            <li> Love this brand and the colors are quality. There isn&#x27;t a taste from the NYX lip liners but a slight taste from the actual lip sticks matte finish.</li>
            <li> Lovely colors perfect</li>
            <li> I have always loved nyx lip liners. They go on smoothly and stay on. The only reason these get 4 stars is the colors were just a little too bright for my taste. The oranges were not very wearable and there is 2 of them in there. Other than that the quality is great.</li>
            <li> Great product for the price. Works wonderfully arrived on time and I just love the colors now I have lip liners for most my lipsticks.</li>
            <li> These are pretty generic lipliners in harder to find colors. The price is really good, especially considering to find colors like these I&#x27;d have to buy liners at MAC for $18 a pop or whatever. I like using these to fill in my lips, then putting a balm on top.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a make-up snob in the past, but times are tough and I can&#x27;t spend mad money on high end products like I used to. I&#x27;ve learned to have 2 sets of make-up, my more expensive \\&quot;special\\&quot; occasion makeup, and my every day \\&quot;not-so-special\\&quot; makeup. These pencils were insanely affordable and one was actually a dupe for my favorite mac lip liner. I especially like this set because of the variety of colors you get. The orange liner(which is supposed to be the \\&quot;it\\&quot; color this season)was something I probably would have never tried otherwise, but actually ended up loving.</li>
            <li> Got every color that was listed. They match great with all my lipsticks. Great pigmentation and they go on very smooth. NYX is one of my favorite cosmetic line. These lip pencils are great!</li>
            <li> The colors weren&#x27;t as natural as they should&#x27;ve been. I felt that it looked more of a light and wasn&#x27;t concentrated to the point where it matched my lipsticks.</li>
            <li> Terrible, - very light for a very light person.  Almost neon.  I hate to throw them away, but they are not in my purse with others.</li>
            <li> Soft lip liners!  Love them!  Hard to find the correct pencil sharpener though, as some of the sharpeners, make the pencil disintegrate!</li>
            <li> I really like these lip liners.  It&#x27;s a great deal.  I got the colors: 840 rose,835 pinky, 846 tangerine, 824 orange, 839 Dolly pink, and 841 coral.  I don&#x27;t know if all the sets have the same colors, but I thought it would be helpful to put the ones I got on here.</li>
            <li> Excellent Experiance I will always ready to shop with them again ... It&#x27;s good more then my expectations ... :))</li>
            <li> A great variety of colors for the price. Very creamy and long lasting. I would definitely recommend! Love NXY, would definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> Great products &amp; very happy with my Purchase!  I&#x27;m so glad I decided to make this purchase.  Will be back for more!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m addicted to makeup and had to have these lip pencils. I loved the variety of colors in this group. I sometimes use them as a lipstick- really to hide the pigmentation of my lip color and I was worried that it would not be pigmented enough and boy as I wrong. I love these and will buy more!</li>
            <li> nyx isn&#x27;t the most amazing quality in general but these pencils has a strong wood smell, which is distracting when applying to lips. the colors are vivid and worth getting if you many colors and wouldn&#x27;t mind a little more.</li>
            <li> Its nice to try a variety of colors to test out for such a cheap price. But I can&#x27;t say I really liked any of them they look and wear cheap. Still haven&#x27;t found \\&quot;my\\&quot; lipstick color.</li>
            <li> These are brightly pigmaneted colors, as others have said.  I was hoping for more natural hues, but what I got was basically neon colors.  I was hoping to lightly line my lips and use lipgloss but this is not possible, as you cannot blend neon colors into your natural lip.  You can either fill in the entire lip, and look like a clown, or you can buy some lipstick to match, and look like a clown.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is next on my list to try: http://www.amazon.com/l-f-Feather-Proof-Moisturizing-Natural/dp/B001HL26QM/ref&#x3D;sr_1_1?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1421368642&amp;sr&#x3D;8-1&amp;keywords&#x3D;natural+color+lip+liner</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get the &amp;#34;Coral&amp;#34; in my set of lip liners. Instead I got something called &amp;#34;856-Sand Rose&amp;#34;. Only two of the colors are good for using-Orange and Pinky. Others are not that visible. Waste of money.</li>
            <li> The colors were repeated so I got 3 instead of 6  I paid a full price for half of the product!!!!</li>
            <li> this lip liner pencils are great to have around.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe I didn&#x27;t find these sooner. These are a million times better than the high end, 20+ dollar ones I&#x27;ve used. Beautiful colors, perfect application, longevity and cheap!</li>
            <li> The color stays quite long and no bad scent at all. But it do make my lips try a little bit. Overall, great products.</li>
            <li> I enjoy this product. It came on time and well package. I love NYX products. The color is just perfect and last all night.</li>
            <li> I dont know why i bought these. kind of an impulse buy. Love this brand but never wear these shades of lipstick. The liners are really smooth and creamy. I wear them to highlight eyes mostly</li>
            <li> Color pay off isn&#x27;t that great</li>
            <li> These are very good I would buy them again</li>
            <li> Love all the colors that came as shown in the picture! &amp; arrived on time so that&#x27;s a plus! You&#x27;ll love these</li>
            <li> All of the colors are really pretty. I actually had my eye on the Coral, but figured I would just buy a pack so I had some variety. I actually ended up LOVING the Rose color the most. It&#x27;s really natural on my skin tone, which is what I wanted. They were really affordable. My only complaint is that they&#x27;re not as creamy as I would have liked, so there is a bit of tug when applying, but I still think they&#x27;re worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> Love these lip liners!!! Great colors and long lasting. My daughter and I were able to share. Excellent price!!! Recommended!!!</li>
            <li> Love these! They last almost all day for me, and work great as a base for my lipsticks. This is a very good product and a staple for your makeup collection!</li>
            <li> I am in love with all the colors. They are pigmented and smooth. I never would have picked some of these colors by myself but turns out they are all great!</li>
            <li> I have wanted Nyx cosmetics ever since I saw &amp;#34;Ru Pauls Drag Race.&amp;#34;  I was so excited when I opened the package and they were in my hands.  I rushed straight to the bath room and tried all of the colors one after another!  They are marvelous!!  The colors are so vivid.  With some other lip liners I&#x27;ve tried the color on the lips doesn&#x27;t actually match the color of the liner.  Not with these.  I LOVE THESE!!!  I highly recommend these liners.</li>
            <li> The colors are great! I have only tried the nude color and it&#x27;s very creamy and slides on the lips smooth.</li>
            <li> Great colors, and the lip pencils go on very smoothly. The pack comes with a great variety of colors, making it very easy for me to match these lip liners with other brands as well. I have found that they are long wearing and are great for preventing color bleeding when wearing red lipsticks especially.</li>
            <li> All colors are as shown and work great love them</li>
            <li> I love NYX products always affordable and easy to work with!! I received all 6 lip liners within 4 days!</li>
            <li> OK, sounds weird, but I&#x27;m really close with my Grandma and she loves these! So I use them now too. (but I go for more modern colors...)</li>
            <li> I love my lip liners, arrived on time, so cheap, really usefull products, finally I love the colors because are so trendy, the shades are variable,</li>
            <li> I love the other colors for the lip liners but, the orangey red. I purchased these to go with some of the lipsticks I own. To my dismay I mistaken the orangy red for a real red. Now, I have to hunt for a red lip liner, UGH. Other than that they are very easy to apply.</li>
            <li> Pretty colors, good pigmentation, not as creamy as I would like but they do their job, nothing wow but what I expected</li>
            <li> I realize some of the reviews for this were good and bad, but I loved the product. It didnt take to long to arrive and I got exactly what I paid for !</li>
            <li> Smooth, highly pigmented lip pencils.  I love the variety of colors, and the orange one is surprisingly beautiful.  I always get compliments!</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite purchases off of Amazon. I love this seller and I adore NYX. The package came sooner than I expected and every lip liner was just as pictured. This is a great price for such wonderful lip colors!! They can stand on their own, or be combined to make a personalized color. The staying power of these liners always amazes me. Anyways, Love these and I will be buying from this seller again!!</li>
            <li> Having a large variety of Lip Liners really come in handy.  What&#x27;s more important is that the price was very reasonable.</li>
            <li> Delivery was fast. However, The colors didn&#x27;t work for me.. :( some of the colors weren&#x27;t pigmented enough. I&#x27;m a bit sad. But if you&#x27;ve used these pencils before don&#x27;t let this review discourage you! They may work for you.</li>
            <li> Yeah I didn&#x27;t write this review, I&#x27;m getting the description.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;According to her all colors are nice, and they last much longer compared to others. If you&#x27;re looking for a softer lip color this is it, if you want bolder colors you might want something else. It&#x27;s a liner not a softer lipstick so it&#x27;s not supposed to be soft and smear, and it is supposed to be a little harder than regular lipstick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All colors are different, so some people might have experienced a packaging issue or they might be color blind. The colors in the picture are also very accurate. Also the statements about them being too liquidly make no sense because they are lip liner pencils and have a good consistent quality, no liquid at all. She would buy them again.</li>
            <li> My wife liked the set and that is what counts.</li>
            <li> This is a great price and great colors! These go on smooth and I love the packaging. Anything black I think looks really elegant.</li>
            <li> I love the assortment of colors and I love NYX brand period. I love make-up and I&#x27;m not a big fan of big brand names, just good quality. Trust me, NYX lip products are everything!</li>
            <li> Not my favorite lip liner just so so but for the price it was worth giving these a shot. They do seem very cakey. I wish they went on smoother.</li>
            <li> Great lip liner pencils. Beautiful colors. There are a couple of the colors that I already use and I love. So I know that I&#x27;ll be ordering more. They&#x27;re easy to apply. I love that I got so many different colors There is a color for every color of lip stick, its great.</li>
            <li> Love all the colors that came wIth this order. I am just getting into experimenting with different colors as well as even wearing make up and these all look great on!.. I love all NYX products!</li>
            <li> I loved the colors.. But it emphasizes dry lips and if they are moisturized, still tends to make them look dry? Blah! Essence cosmetic liners sold at Ulta are cheaper and smoother.. Wet &amp; wild is similar quality for cheaper as well, more product, and isn&#x27;t as drying.</li>
            <li> LOVE YOUUUU, I LOVE ITTTT, VERY GOOD PRODUCT</li>
            <li> I really like most of these colors. I guess I have really pigmented lips, so the lighter colors don&#x27;t really show up on my lips. But overall I like these liners</li>
            <li> I outline and fill in my lips then apply a nude gloss…viola, new color!!! You can even create Ombre effects!!!</li>
            <li> I give it 4 stars only because the colors seem more vibrant in pictures the 2nd one is kind of goldish and I don&#x27;t really like it and the one that appears hot pink isn&#x27;t really hotpink but It was a good price for 4 and very fast shipping two days.</li>
            <li> a little too dry and hard..colors are true to color on end.</li>
            <li> I am very glad I bought a set. I&#x27;ve never enjoyed wearing makeup as much as I do now. I love the colors. They&#x27;re long-lasting and easy to blend. They all go well with almost all of my other lipsticks.</li>
            <li> Excellent Lip Liners. soft and smooth, glides easily on my lips, last longer than my other lip liners and the colors are awesome!!!! Arrived fast</li>
            <li> These are horrible colors! And look much larger in the picture than what you receive. Don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> I love love all nyx cosmetic products.  These lip liners are awesome.  I will be ordering more nyx products from there website. Just being honest:-)</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like them, they make your lips so dry and they were just not worth buying. They are just siting in my room.</li>
            <li> I purchased these for the colors and the price!!! I really love the colors and thought it wouldn&#x27;t be a huge loss if I didn&#x27;t like them.... The only thing is the color doesn&#x27;t last more than 3-4 hours... I don&#x27;t mind reapplying ;) But using this with a great lipgloss was the finished product that I was looking for!!!</li>
            <li> These bright and fun colors pair perfectly with NYX matte lipsticks.  I occasionally wear the liner on it&#x27;s own by filling in the entire lip, giving a light matte look that really does last all night.  This product and NYX brand in general are reasonably priced for a great value.</li>
            <li> Came in two weeks..nice</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried NYX pencils before and loved them but these don&#x27;t seem as pigmented so I&#x27;m wondering if they are truly &amp;#34;NYX&amp;#34; lip liners.</li>
            <li> Love these colors, a great quality product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;VE TRIED JUST ABOUT EVER LIP LINER ON THE MARKET--FROM DIRT CHEAP TO RELATIVELY EXPENSIVE. THIS IS THE SECOND TIME I AM PURCHASING THIS PRODUCT. I DID CONSIDER BUYING JUST ONE PENCIL--WITH THE COLOR I USE THE MOST--BUT FOR THIS PRICE--YOU CANT GO WRONG--AND THE LINERS LAST ALL DAY!</li>
            <li> I already love NYX brand, but it&#x27;s difficult sometimes to find every shade you want. I really love every single color! This saved me the trip to a bunch of different stores. Thank you!</li>
            <li> NO ONE CAN WEAR THESE COLORS</li>
            <li> well first of i wanna say i like these lip colors and their well pigmented but i need more brighter color for me.. i love wild crazy color but besides the point i love em i can rock them.....;)</li>
            <li> unfortunately, these pencils are not good as it should be and even if you hate them up to take the liquid from them, it did not work for me at all.</li>
            <li> Beautiful colors. Perfect for summer. All you need is some Vaseline and you got the prettiest lips on the block.</li>
            <li> This is a really nice set, and for the price, you can&#x27;t beat it. It lasts all day and I love the colors.</li>
            <li> I love the quality and colors of these pencils.. These are the best because I&#x27;ve used different brands and these products are super soft.The price is also cheap. I am very happy with these products, I&#x27;ve bought 2 packs (one for me and for a friend of mine).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always loved NYX&#x27;s lip products but these were my first lip liners that i&#x27;ve tried by them and to be honest they really changed my view on lip liners! They are a lot smaller than I expected (the pictures make them look more like chubby sticks but they are only the size of an eye liner pencil) but I still love them. The color lasts all day and are very vibrant! Would recommend to anyone!</li>
            <li> Really good but,I love the colors</li>
            <li> i am only giving it a 4 star bcos the colors dont match what it looks like online. the pencils are very well pigmented but then the colors useful are only 3 in the package. Also, there is no red in this packet its actually orange/coral, alot of people got mislead by that</li>
            <li> These came in SO fast, and the quality is amazingly long lasting under lipstick. I love NXY, this is a steal of a deal!</li>
            <li> I love these ! Great colors, stay well. They do smell like school wood pencils but whatever. Lol will buy more and soon.</li>
            <li> all the color are beautiful!! i satisfact with the effect also, chromatically is easy,  it&#x27;s very good especially for this price!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve recently become obsessed with the NYX cosmetics. I didn&#x27;t use to wear lipstick or lip liner, however the makeup guru in me as surfaced and I was told that I have great lips and that I should play with some lip color...ever since I was told that I&#x27;ve been having fun with different colors for the summer. The coral and tangerine have been my go to. I liked them so much that my best friend ordered some as well. I recommend them for sure!</li>
            <li> Great lip liners that end up matching other non NYX lipsticks that I have, even my ruby woo lipstick from MAC matches the pencils.&lt;br /&gt;I have been really impressed with NYX and their products and colors.</li>
            <li> Loove it.&lt;br /&gt;Must buy they work and they go beautiful on your lips. I recommend everyone too buy this. :).</li>
            <li> Hated the pencils colors are off I had to throw must of them away 😞😞😞</li>
            <li> I do like these colors but 3 of them are so light and similar that you could barely see the color. Of course when I add lipstick with it its ok but I thought they were going to be brighter.</li>
            <li> the colors show up nice. love it</li>
            <li> Just like pictured. Arrived on time.</li>
            <li> I have NYX cosmetics. they are affordable and very good quality for the price you pay. I highly recommend this set. BEAUTIFUL colors!</li>
            <li> Great color turnout, stays on pretty long, lots of fun colors. Super great deal for the price.</li>
            <li> For  cheaper brand of makeup, no complaints. Works as intended!</li>
            <li> I dont love or either hate it. It is definitely a good deal but most of the colors i would not use it.</li>
            <li> nice and lovely as expected by my wife.</li>
            <li> When i bought these of course i read the reviews. When i got them in yesterday, of course i had to try them out. OMG I feel in love! They are beautiful colors. :D i will def be buying more when i need them :D</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t beat the price or variation in colors.  Dontvfeel a bit guilty for have, I think, EVERY shade :-)</li>
            <li> These are so Cute and I could wear them as Lipstick. It gives me a matte lipstick look on my lips.. and does it lasts?? YESSSS!! Love em!</li>
            <li> Colors are pretty. I tried 2 and they went on smooth and felt very soft. I will be using them in the near future.</li>
            <li> I love these lipsticks ! I think they&#x27;re the best ❤️ I really do recommend this to all girl, all ages</li>
            <li> Love all the colors! Super fun lip linnets for spring and summer. I use them almost everyday and I really like them.</li>
            <li> Your products are  amazing ! I can now enjoying making up my face, n will order more  of ur products. Thanks u so much. Very happy.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, and I love the colors!</li>
            <li> Some of them are nice and creamy and some are very dry. Think I will go back to my local drug store brand.</li>
            <li> These pencils are nice. Some are nice colors others not so nice but you can mixed them with other lipstick colors and it does the job. I&#x27;m glad I purchased these. It was very much needed.</li>
            <li> These were awful they were chalky vey liquidy. Do not buy such a horrible product!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! It&#x27;s terrible I would not recto end.</li>
            <li> I got this as a present for some for Xmas. They were really happy with and have been using it regularly.</li>
            <li> love the liners, pigmented. thanx</li>
            <li> Beautiful lip liners for the price. Obviously not as pigmented as others but great price.</li>
            <li> Just as good as high end lip liners.  Even better than most.</li>
            <li> I was using some Korean brand lip liners and thought they were  good but after using the NYX ones I&#x27;ve totally forgotten all about the Korean ones!&lt;br /&gt;I love these lipliners! Awesome set of colors!</li>
            <li> Great quality, great price, and great colors for spring and summer. I may not used them all during fall or winter days, unless I&#x27;m looking for a little extravagant look. I&#x27;m very satisfied with the quality of NYX lipliners!</li>
            <li> they are amazing i love all them colors they have the perfect size the only thing is that they are kind of dry you may want to put lip balm first.</li>
            <li> These are Ok.  The application is a little rough.  The colors tend to flake and gum up while you&#x27;re applying them.  Warming up the sticks only results in awkward application.</li>
            <li> NYX makes incredible lip and eyeliner pencils....for under $13 this was an amazing deal!</li>
            <li> These are low quality lip liners. Total waist of time and money.</li>
            <li> I love NYX products for the most part, but I was kinda disappointed when I used these. I just felt like they didn&#x27;t really give off a great coverage when I applied it. I had to do several rounds of this before I was able to put on my lipstick and it didn&#x27;t blend very well. Even when I did just a little lip gloss, it just seemed to disappear. I am not really impressed with the product. I would recommend this products to teenagers.</li>
            <li> nice colors get more thanks</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like all the color.</li>
            <li> These are amazing, so pigmented and creamy, not to mention long-lasting. Great dupes for higher end products.</li>
            <li> If I could give it no stars I definitely would. I bought these because the colors looked so beautiful and when I received them they definitely were but then I tried them on and you could hardly see them! They were dry so I thought if I put some chapstick on before I applied the lip liner that it&#x27;ll work and none of them did. Maybe it was knock off of the real NYX  lip liner I don&#x27;t know. The price was definitely good but not the product.</li>
            <li> The color is just off on me and cakes I would not recommend this</li>
            <li> Very pretty colors! longlasting and high pigmented</li>
            <li> Very nice and they do go on easily, of course I use a lip conditioner before I apply them but they are smooth pencils and I really like the colors, very versatile and can work with just about any color, remember they don&#x27;t have to match the lipstick shade exactly.</li>
            <li> All of the colors are great and what is a major plus is that i now have a liner match for all six of my individual &amp;#34;too faced melted&amp;#34; lippies, which is a must have to keep from feathering/ bleeding!!! &amp;#34;AMAZEballs&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> There is little pigmentation. I really expected more from this brand.</li>
            <li> Love them I would buy them again , very good for the low price recommend this to any person that want to buy this thing buy it don&#x27;t be afraid it&#x27;s exc</li>
            <li> Great pigment and stay power. I sometimes just use these to add a little color &amp; then top with a light clear gloss or balm.</li>
            <li> Okay, let&#x27;s get to it!&lt;br /&gt;I am not a make-up guru, Youtube Girl, or artist.&lt;br /&gt;I am just a girl in love with Make up.&lt;br /&gt;These colors are perfect, you can sharpen these pencils, meaning they last long...&lt;br /&gt;The lender was perfect, I had no trouble.&lt;br /&gt;These pencils came before the estimated date.&lt;br /&gt;I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased!</li>
            <li> love the colors and staying power and the PRICE for a good lip liner!!!</li>
            <li> I found these pencils to be so dry they actually hurt as I applied them on my lips didn&#x27;t like them at all a waste of my money :(</li>
            <li> the variety of colors considering its price will give it 5 stars. you don&#x27;t have to buy expensive products to look good and this is an example of practical items you must have</li>
            <li> These weren&#x27;t bad, kind of sheer but overall not bad colors. Unless you like bright shiny/sparkling lip colors I would not recommend buying these.</li>
            <li> That is what it is. Not bad. I kinda like it. They are small. The delivery was quick.</li>
            <li> love all these colors! for the price they are great! use them under lipstick as a base or on their own. so pretty!</li>
            <li> Well , for one thing , I&#x27;ve always loved NYX products ! They&#x27;re affordable and you usually get more than what you pay for . They were delivered quick and I just LOVE the colors ! They&#x27;re so beautiful and exotic ! A must have ! Extremely satisfied !</li>
            <li> Great gifts.  And great use of product</li>
            <li> Loved them.!! Will repurchase</li>
            <li> Perfect summer colors !! Nice formula for a lasting wear and great price too !!!</li>
            <li> SO PERFECT! THANKS I WILL BUYING MORE PRODUCTS IN YOUR STORE</li>
            <li> I already knew NYX products were great, so when I found these for so cheap I scooped them right up. What impressed me most was how fast the shipping was, though! They arrived 3 days after I purchased them, 4 days before the first day of the delivery estimate. If you&#x27;re looking for a good deal on some great lip liners, buy these.</li>
            <li> All different colors, but two of them are quite close in appearance. But really good buy for 15$! I recommend for those who wear bright colors on their lips--the pinks match most of my collection!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got the NYX Cosmetics Long Lasting (no kidding but I&#x27;ll explain why it&#x27;s not good) lip pencils in several colors. I was so excited after reading these reviews and I purchased them in ULTA - hence no verified purchase here - but I can&#x27;t stand them. they are low quality and the line is harsh and almost like drawing with pencil on my face. It does not feel good and the colors are not very nice. It just doesn&#x27;t work for me. I use them on occasion still but it&#x27;s not my favorite. I&#x27;ve moved on to higher quality products. Just beware the quality is very low and the look is not professional or even close ... but it does go on and stay there. Just doesn&#x27;t look good. I&#x27;m not getting any more liners from NYX.</li>
            <li> Leo&#x27;s wife writing. Creamy and nice colors, for the price is a good starter in the lip liner world.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery and good product&lt;br /&gt;Thxxxx</li>
            <li> Not as good as a Mac lip liner if your looking for that quality of a liner, they are not creamy if your looking for a creamy lip liner, there kinda dry but I would not say overly dry, do not expect them to be as large as they look on the ad, they&#x27;re thinner, kinda like a eye liner, but that is to be expected with viewing something on a screen, but a great price for 6 liners, the colors are pretty nice, but all very similar, &amp; as some others mentioned in there reviews kinda neon-like colors very bright &amp; as I said very close to one another, I sometimes bright neon colors, so this is fine for me but maybe not suited for other&#x27;s taste so if bright neon colors are not your thing this buy will be a waste for you, now the colors go on nice &amp; the color stay on a decent amount of time, but not long lasting all day, but I do like them, I have my high end make up &amp; my drug store brands &amp; cheaper make up &amp; I have always liked NYX Products, they have great afordable cosmetics. Over all I&#x27;am pleased with this purchase for the price but on the other hand a tad bit dissapointed because the colors look so much different than when you put them on &amp; it should state that they are bright &amp; bold and neon types. for me not a total bust &amp; I will make use of them &amp; a fast ship..</li>
            <li> GARISH COLORS AND HARD PENCIL POINT</li>
            <li> A+ thinking about ordering the brown/nudes now</li>
            <li> There are 6 colors and only two of them are useful... In pic they look nice and bright colors but when I got them only two of them worked for me. The color that looks orange is way lighter and doesn&#x27;t have any color. The light purple is too light as well. Again in pictures they look pretty bright but in reality they r too light.</li>
            <li> These are super cool Lip pencil. Must have.</li>
            <li> Ladies, if you&#x27;re second guessing on whether to buy it or not, you definitely won&#x27;t be disappointed. I fell in love with every single lip liner and the colors stayed on thru a good duration of time before having to reapply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It goes on matte, bold and some subtle colors, and keep my lipstick from melting off my lips. Lol.</li>
            <li> Love this set!  I will be purchasing more of them Great little gift! The colors are perfect and go with every complexionIm Thinking of using them for my next diner party as favors splitting up in sets of two. Great stocking stuffer---</li>
            <li> I was a little, err, ok, a LOT, surprised by these FABULOUS lip liners!!!  Mostly because of the price, but also, I have never even heard of NYX makeup, so it was all new to me.  I normally wear Estee Lauder, Lancome or MAC, and as you know they are quite expensive, but also, you still always have to touch them up throughout the day/night.  These NYX lip liners stay on all day long!!  The colors are absolutely gorgeous and has a lot of pigment in them.  They have become my favorite lip liners and I will be checking out more NYX makeup.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I saw some of the reviews and I wasn&#x27;t sure if I wanted to get this lip lines, however I need it something other than red and pink, so I gave it a go and I am VERY impress, you can use this lip liners with your lipstick- lip gloss or use your lip balm and use them as a filler.&lt;br /&gt;They are not creamy so don&#x27;t except super soft lips BUT they have great color. :-)</li>
            <li> Very happy with product and will deffinately recommend and it last long n ur lips luv it i probly order more a+++++</li>
            <li> Love Nyx! Such a great brand and these pencils have great pigmentation and as long as you mosturize your lips before applying they go on smoothly. Also, really love the range of colors you get from this set!!</li>
            <li> Shipping was faster then expected and the liners are great!</li>
            <li> I think the Pinks are amazing, the red and oranges I rarely use. Overall the product does what it does.</li>
            <li> great value for the money. pretty colors wish there were some nudes and purples</li>
            <li> Honestly i thought they were larger but its ok , i tried one and its very very good :) i might repurchase them :) thank you &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> Great product, fast shipping. Very smooth going on your lips. Wish there were a little more choices for colors, considering I have much darker skin, still awesome, would buy again.</li>
            <li> The picture makes it look like the colors are a bit different. For example, it looks like there is a red and orange lip pencil but there is only one reddish lip pencil and the rest are varying shades of pink. All pretty! But the picture is high in contrast so it looks like there would be other shades and there aren&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish I could upload a pic because I just did some swatches. I&#x27;ll try my best to describe the colors if anyone wants to take the time to read through this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These colors are highly pigmented and not subdued at all if you&#x27;re more of a natural person. You can always blot the color a bit and apply some lip balm (if you don&#x27;t like the dry feel since it&#x27;s very Matte applied alone) to achieve a more subtle look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The color &amp;#34;Orange&amp;#34; is more of a red with orange undertones. It&#x27;s my favorite so far it&#x27;s very vibrant and eye-catching. The color &amp;#34;Sand Pink/Sable Rose&amp;#34; Is a midton-pink leaning towards the purpley side, The color &amp;#34;Rose&amp;#34; is straight mid-tone pink. &amp;#34;Tangerine&amp;#34; is a bright (think barbie) light pink. &amp;#34;Dolly Pink/ Rose Poupee&amp;#34; is a bright light purple with a bit of pink color. &amp;#34;Pinky/Rose&amp;#34; reminds me a lot of the &amp;#34;Sand Pink/Sable Rose&amp;#34; except more pink in tone than purple.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are about the size of an eyeliner pencil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this was helpful!</li>
            <li> This purchase came in the mail pretty quickly! I love colors but they weren&#x27;t a great fit for me with complexion.</li>
            <li> Beautiful colors, just wish they went on darker. A couple are very light and hard to see. Love the orange which is my favorite.</li>
            <li> These are amazing! If you need lipliners to go with all your summer lipsticks.. I&#x27;m sure one of the ones in this package would work.</li>
            <li> All the colors are very nice, but some I wish were more pigmented. Although, I found that the colors are all great for summer and are very in fashion right now. i just wish the quality was a bit better. Arrived in a timely maker.</li>
            <li> I would definetly buy this lip liners again. I love the pigmentation and the colors are amazing. I often use them as lip stick...</li>
            <li> Nice colors easy to apply and great value. &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> This is a great deal for this product and quantity.</li>
            <li> I love these lip pencils there exactly&lt;br /&gt;what I wanted there great quality&lt;br /&gt;for less a must have ! ♥</li>
            <li> Good variety of pinks. Nice and smooth application.</li>
            <li> Love the colors! The product is very good for the price.</li>
            <li> Got these on time and the colors are fantastic. Bright and vibrant, I love all of them. I wish there were more orange colors offered but the ones that come in the group are pretty.</li>
            <li> Not very good quality you can&#x27;t hardly see the line</li>
            <li> Very good quality, although I wouldn&#x27;t mind if their colour was more intense and not that soft</li>
            <li> thank you so much , very fast shipment&lt;br /&gt;and good dealing and the shipment exactly as described</li>
            <li> I wear them alone under gloss/lipbalm for the most part. Great colors, slides on great. Lasts decently long :) Great price!</li>
            <li> I really liked these, smooth application. I use them to make it look like I have lip color on all day.&lt;br /&gt;Great buy for the price.</li>
            <li> I loved the colors and easy to apply.</li>
            <li> Nice lip liners in multi colors.</li>
            <li> I love these! They&#x27;re easy to put on and the colors are perfect. I use them just about every day. The price is extremely reasonable, so I look forward to eventually purchasing more!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product. I found two of them really dry.</li>
            <li> Cakey....its so dry on your lips and it looks like my skin was peeling off..i guess the best thing to do is to use a chap stick then apply this and on top of it, you need a lip stick or you will look someone dropped cigarette ashes on your lips...too lazy to return so I guess I will make it work.</li>
            <li> Just like the ones you would buy in the store. (:</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a cosmetology student and don&#x27;t have the budget to afford department store brands anymore. This is a surprisingly great alternative that offers a smooth application and wonderful coverage that stays! The color choices are nice and not too similar to each other. Great buy.</li>
            <li> The colors are good and pigmented. I&#x27;m happy with the product. There better than the cheap beauty supply brands. Would definety repurchase!</li>
            <li> Always have loved NYX Cosmetics products...such good pigment in these lipliners. So cheap and great quality with everything of theirs!!</li>
            <li> Love nyx liners, none of these colors go well with my lipsticks....</li>
            <li> It´s beautiful, they have amazing colors,&lt;br /&gt;jsjs&lt;br /&gt;akakak&lt;br /&gt;amsams&lt;br /&gt;dskd&lt;br /&gt;ksks&lt;br /&gt;ksks&lt;br /&gt;ksks&lt;br /&gt;ksks&lt;br /&gt;ksks&lt;br /&gt;ksksks&lt;br /&gt;ksksk&lt;br /&gt;ksks&lt;br /&gt;ksks&lt;br /&gt;ksk</li>
            <li> I knew there would be at least one out of six that I would probably continue using....I like &amp;#34;orange&amp;#34;. The other colors are too light for me.  I gave the pinks to my blond granddaughter.  I like the texture and it stays on okay...would still like to find one that stays on through a meal.  I like that they&#x27;re made in W. Germany.  I bought three more of the orange color. This was a good deal.</li>
            <li> Love these! I&#x27;ve had em for about a year now. So affordable and the staying power is awesome plus they&#x27;re super pigmented. My favorite is Orange which is the most beautiful red that looks great alone, Pinky, a pretty magenta that looks awesome under pink lipstick, and Tangerine, a satin-finish nude pink that is amazing with a clear gloss ontop.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I tried Nyx anything and I MUST ADMIT that I&#x27;m a fan! I love all the colors and they look so pretty and work so well with my skin tone NC30 (winter I am the palest of NC30, NC25 is way too pale and the summer I am NC35) This is so creamy and just glides on! All the colors don&#x27;t pull/tug and they just glide on! Looks so beautiful as a full lipstick or just outline...orange is so bright and vivid and looks just like a reddish orange and the pink dolly is so bright and reminds me of Nicki manaj lips or whatnot. there are 2 colors that looks similar to one another like orange and tangerine except tangerine isn&#x27;t as bright but it&#x27;s a tone or two down. Then I think rose and that other pink shade are similar as well and one is more vivid and bright and the other is a tone or two down but they are sooooooo PRETTY! will Def order again. Very similar to MACs liners.</li>
            <li> I liked that there were so many colors to choose from, however a couple of them have a real orange tint to them that isn&#x27;t flattering at all to my light skin tone.  I do like the two that are a hot pink color.  These liners are long lasting, however don&#x27;t expect them to last all day.  For the price I think they are worth the money.</li>
            <li> Loveeeee these. I was scared they would be too bright but theyre very subtle and soft. Very easy to apply</li>
            <li> MEH.&lt;br /&gt;Nothing unusually great about these.&lt;br /&gt;Wouldn&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> SUPER AWESOME FAST SHIPPING</li>
            <li> I bought these lip liners bc I had lots of different lip glosses and sticks that matches them pretty well. Prevents the lip color from running. They didn&#x27;t have this set in the drug store/ beauty stores so I bought it online and was very pleased with the color and I didn&#x27;t have to use much so these should last me a while.</li>
            <li> great quality and pigmented, well done and great prices for 6 of them !!! thank you so much i love it</li>
            <li> the colors are awesome, its three shades of pink and three shades of orange, they are very trendy and they go on the lips smoothly.</li>
            <li> I really love lip liners and I love NYX but together not so much. These were really drying on my lips and when I rubbed my lips together they just wouldn&#x27;t. It was that dry. They looked cakey on my lips. I&#x27;m not one to just throw something away so I decided to make them work. I like to put a clear Chapstick over them like an eos. I guess it depends on what your skin is like and what your willing to do to make them work. Over all not the worst not the best.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t get quality like this for the price anywhere else.</li>
            <li> These are amazing for the price, such good quality, anyone in 2 minds, buy them&lt;br /&gt;The shade range is great, the only one missing is a deep red</li>
            <li> The glad very soft &amp; soomth to the touch! Great quality lip liners! Nyx lip liners are a good buy.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure about this ones, but the price made me want to try them... LOL... Once I got them I was super excited to try every color on! I thought there were repeated colors, but once I tried them they really are different shades. They look amazing and last long enough.&lt;br /&gt;Will buy again!</li>
            <li> I love these colors perfect for bright, vibrant colors of lipstick to match completely to make my lips look fuller! Thank you! Always purchased the warm set of lip liners from this brand also, so much cheaper than buying them separately from the original website!</li>
            <li> Great Lip Liners... Great quality a wide variety of colors i know i will use. they go on very smooth, also feel like MAC lip liners.</li>
            <li> I use them as a lipstick! Especially love 2 pink colors. The others two light orange i find pretty similar to each other</li>
            <li> Nice selection of colors, but the colors are all on the lighter side. I often use these instead of lipstick. They are long lasting.</li>
            <li> smooth texture vibrant color  and a good value. sharpening can be a bit of a challenge but other than that they are all good</li>
            <li> A good way to get a few colors of NYX liners to try. They are quite good, and not over priced. I love the colors I was sent.</li>
            <li> LOVE this set! I got them during winter time but now that it&#x27;s spring here they fit everything better. Really bright colors, glide on smoothly. Sharpen just fine,would buy again!</li>
            <li> The lip liners are more bright colors. Not soft pinks or reds. Very bright. If you like your lips to stand out. Theses are for you.Just to bright for me. I like softer pinks and reds. This like punk rock kinda look...</li>
            <li> Great buy you save about $2 for each lip liner and it arrived in less than 5 days. Also, I got exactly the colors it shows above . The colors show up great ! They could be used all over the lips as well however don&#x27;t forget to apply lip balm on top or as a base because they are very drying.</li>
            <li> Good quality, pretty colors. I use these as matte lip color. These are very opaque and stay put for a good while.</li>
            <li> i didn&#x27;t really expect these colors Lol, i should have looked closer. but i liked them a lot . very cute</li>
            <li> Love it and the colors are awesome</li>
            <li> Love me and why ask lip pencil but these are all psychedelic electric colors. Yuk!</li>
            <li> Theyre the best purchase I have ever made from NYX, usually I dont wear lip liners but these changed my mind.</li>
            <li> great quality liners especially if  you&#x27;re starting a kit. like me. you get your money&#x27;s worth. these liners are very pigmented. the range of colors is awesome. shipping was quick and everything was wrapped well.</li>
            <li> I have used NYX  lip pencils for a while and was grateful to find these for a good price. They  came in good condition and brand new. Not old or dried out and I have been using them like crazy!</li>
            <li> They are good quality but the colors are almost the same , I am not happy with my purchase</li>
            <li> I did not like them . The colors are too light and don&#x27;t last</li>
            <li> this set of lip liner are just what I needed, it is soft and glided nicely on my lips .. need such set in other colours too</li>
            <li> Great value! Love the variety of colors.</li>
            <li> i love the colors and it stays on really will</li>
            <li> In love with this but it is not really long lasting</li>
            <li> This lip Liner is great! in fact its better than some of the M.A.C that I have . I highly recommend it , colors are very true to pics</li>
            <li> An awesome color selection they put for this pack, the pigmentation &amp; smoothness to apply it is okay. Of course you can find better but to start off and not pay an arm and leg they&#x27;re pretty good!</li>
            <li> These line the lips well. Not my fave brand. But they were inexpensive. The colors are ok. Would have preferred more neutral colors in this pack. But they&#x27;re ok.</li>
            <li> Color didn&#x27;t stay on long, but nice colors</li>
            <li> It lasts long enough for me. The colors are a bit too much in the photos but looks more normal in the actual product. I love the colors by the way.</li>
            <li> I love these colors, except the pencil can be a bit drying on the lips. I like the nyx retractable liners better because theyre more moisturizing. But I still love these!</li>
            <li> So happy I received all these for this price.  More than half the cost at Ulta!  Fantastic deal and I wish you had a lot more to get! lol...Id be jumping on those!</li>
            <li> I am definitely a MAC girl. Up until recently, I&#x27;ve only used and worked with MAC products. The only issue I had was the price. Although I love their lipsticks and lipliner, it hurt my wallet to break out $15 every time my favorite lipliner ran out. I ran into NYX at Ulta and decided to try one out. I immediately fell in love. The quality and price drew me in instantly. They glide on easily have somewhat of a creamy feeling. I guess, not much of a dry feeling. Also, a lot of their colors go great with the MAC lipsticks that I have. Whether you&#x27;re trying to match a color or if your trying to blend and fade your colors.</li>
            <li> I bought them thinking I would use them all but mostly I just use fuchsia. I like the others but, but they are a bit light. Overall good product.</li>
            <li> These pencils are THE BEST! Easy to apply and long lasting. I wear one everyday! Highly recommended. I often find my self directing people to amazon to purchase these pencils because of the frequent questions and compliments.</li>
            <li> Great colors and price. But they are not long lasting at all.  I recommend this for people on a budget.</li>
            <li> These liners are even better than I thought they would be!!! I love NYX brand, and was expecting something great, and I definitely received it!!! Great job!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> These are great inexpensive lip liners that last surprisingly well and have a very rich bright color selection!  I have used them several times now and combine them with my lipsticks and glosses and I think, especially for the $$, that these are great.  If your lips are dry, I would recommend softening them up with a lip balm before applying these because they will get a little dry/chalky feeling and not look as great.  Other than that, its a good product.</li>
            <li> these work great. they are long lasting and hold up very well. I will be reordering different colors soon. Very happy with it.</li>
            <li> I did like 2 out of the 6 but first of all they weren&#x27;t close to the color on the tip and 2nd I  thought at least 4out of the 6 I would use for sure. But two of them are almost exactly the same and the nice pink one is not mauvy pink it&#x27;s barbie pink like the other one but less bright (not neon) but still not a practical color. Of course the orange one is NO for me but the purple pink and the brownsih pink look pretty good on and the pigment is really good, I just wish the colors were more usable. It&#x27;s a great cost if you love bright colors but I love more pink,nude colors. Not really happy about the pencils but I do have fun having barbie lips today and it looked good with my dark hair. So maybe if anything I will love a new lip look that I thought I would never wear.</li>
            <li> After spending a ridiculous $60+ on four MakeUpForever/Mac Lip Liners, I decided I would save them for special occasions and find a cheaper alternative for daily use.  Decided to try NYX based on the reviews. The truth is you get what you pay for. First of all, you must apply lip balm for the color to even go on, not creamy at all. The liner will either crack on your lips or just not go on if you do not wear chap stick before. Once you manage to have it on, the color still won&#x27;t fully cover your lips, you can always put a similar color lipstick on for full coverage. Not long lasting at all. Put it on in the morning and after a cup of coffee and water, you will be left with a stain of color and need to reapply. The colors are really very pretty, which is the only reason why I would give three stars if any. Since I do like the colors and luckily similar color lip sticks I&#x27;ll keep using them, but will never purchase again. Also, I originally purchased it specifically because of the orange liner. It&#x27;s not particularly orange, more like a dark/orangy pink, very ugly.</li>
            <li> They are great lip liners and came in quickly the only reason I gave it four stars are because it doesn&#x27;t include any darker colored liners for red or dark lipsticks.</li>
            <li> I loved the price but I must say it just feels cheap. The colors are not very vivid and don&#x27;t exactly match up to the color you would think you were using. I would not buy this again..</li>
            <li> Love color and pigment</li>
            <li> I live NYX and these lip liners are quality; they are alays a staple in my very large make up bag.</li>
            <li> The color does nit last as ling as I had hoped.</li>
            <li> The colors in this set are pretty, but very similar to each other.  The formula is very dry!  I can&#x27;t even come up with the words to explain how dry. I will be passing these along to my young niece for her play makeup kit.  Not a good purchase for me.</li>
            <li> I love the colors. At 1st I was upset because I recieved two of the same colors and was missing one of the colors but when I let Brittiny know  She sent me the correct color at a very speedy process so I am Pleased.</li>
            <li> These are a great choice for spring and summer colors.  If you are one of those girls that have a hard time trying to match your lipsticks with the pencils, then you should consider purchasing these.  Nyx has a great reputation with quality products to back it up.  Like other name brand cosmetics companies, they have a wide arrangement of proud st, but not at the expensive name brand price.  I purchased this set and the neutral/brown color set.  I also have all of the chunky eye pencils, and I will be purchasing the chunky lip pencils as well.</li>
            <li> The colors are beautiful! Perfect for this year spring and summer but I thought they were going to be jumbo pencils but they were the small skinny ones but egh tht are still very pretty</li>
            <li> all the colors matched the lipstick i had previously  loved the page and for a great price thankkks♥♥♥♥</li>
            <li> Performs as pencil lip liners are expected to perform, colors are accurate.</li>
            <li> Seller was great it came nice and fast and nicely wraped up to protect but I didnt find colors that nice like I expected bit if you mix them they can be nice colored and also they DONT last long. I have some cheap other lips pencils that last hours and this one doesnt last more than half hour without correction. So I would not order this again but I would be happy to order something else from this seller!</li>
            <li> Wow the colors are true to the picture packaging was great and I can&#x27;t wait to make my lips pop will order again</li>
            <li> These are literally the best lip liners I have ever tried! I would highly suggest them! Great price and service!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping! Great product and i love the variety of colors. I didn&#x27;t think I would use any of them, but all of them are great!</li>
            <li> Pretty colors, great quality, I love them. You can wear them with all different lipstick color.</li>
            <li> I love , It&#x27;s great , good pigmentation  and  I recommend .  Arrived on time !!!!!!  thanks for they :)</li>
            <li> These are great lip liners, especially for the price. I gave it a 4-star rating because it would be nice to have them be a little creamier and easier to apply. I usually wear down the tip a bit by moving it over some Kleenex-that makes the tip softer and easier to apply. A good range of colors for someone with very pale skin, like me.</li>
            <li> The reason why I&#x27;m giving it a 4 is because I was a little disappointed with the size of the pencils, definitely thought they were bigger. Also I did not receive that bright orange color instead I received two that look almost the same and I that bright orange was the one I was most excited about. Other than that the arrival time was great. Good conditions and I love the matte colors.</li>
            <li> These pencils are of high quality, and high pigment.  Made in Germany.  They also last a long time. I bought a second set to have at work and in my car.</li>
            <li> I bought this lot only because of the color dolly pink and because it was a great deal also and I have to say that I looove all of them. They look great in my skin tone which its medium.</li>
            <li> I had read the reviews for this set of NYX pencils, and while most said they liked them, the ones who didn&#x27;t were quite adamant, leaving specific reasons why.  Thus, I ordered the set because I liked the colors and was hopeful that they were as pigmented and applied as smoothly as some reviewers reported.      I have to say that while these pencils aren&#x27;t the worst I&#x27;ve experienced, they are somewhat close.  The ones I ordered do NOT apply smoothly at all.  They may be slightly more pigmented than those 99-cent Wet &#x27;N Wild pencils, but what good does that do when they are dry and difficult to apply at all?  I was quite disappointed in this set, since I&#x27;m generally pleased with NYX products as a whole.  My guess, with these mixed reviews is that different lots, as well as the age of the product account for very different reviews.    I will say that the pencil, overall, looks pretty in the drawer!    Unfortunately mine are being returned.</li>
            <li> Not creamy on the lips at all unless I pass a lighter flame over it.</li>
            <li> Receive the package quickly !&lt;br /&gt;Good products</li>
            <li> I like the natural colors in this product. Easy to use. I recommend it.</li>
            <li> Love the range of colors and the price is right.</li>
            <li> i use them as lipstick colors instead of lipliner and i love them. they go on so creamy and smooth then when they &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34; they become a beautiful matte color. i carry them with me if i go out but i&#x27;ve never had to reapply them. and they don&#x27;t come off whenever i take a drink of something, that&#x27;s always a bonus.</li>
            <li> Amazing! So happy I got these now I have a liner to go with my favorite lipsticks! Very fast shipping and received in perfect condition! Happy happy happy!</li>
            <li> My only issue with these liners is that they dont last like other liners. They smudge off after an hour or so, just like lipstick.</li>
            <li> The only reason I would give this product a 4.5 instead of a 5 is because I wish there was one color that was a true nude or nude w a very small hint of pink, included in these for versatility.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The colors are hot! My favorite, so far is a pink with blue undertones called &amp;#34;Dolly.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quality of these NYX lip liners is most similar, in my opinion, to MACs lip-liners. The NYX liners are lovely! Their pigmentation is strong, and when applied to, and worn on my lips, the pigment lasts a typical amount of time for lip liners that are not classified as &amp;#34;Long-Wearing&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Macs lip liners are significantly longer (in physical length), so there is more product, but they are also sold at a higher price point. I like the NYX ones bc they are easily transportable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used many lip liners from various high-end brands, as well as quite a few from Revlon and L&#x27;oreal (Target or Drug Store Brand).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually stick with Mac bc of the color selection and pigmentation of the colors, or Revlon Colorstay lip-liner in nude because it honestly stays on all day, and is complimentary to many lipsticks and glosses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These NYX liners are easy to apply because they practically glide across the lip - no drying out or tugging. I&#x27;m glad I ordered them and would order from this vendor again, as they arrived on time and in perfect condition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you,&lt;br /&gt;Chrissie</li>
            <li> I am a big fan of NYX cosmetics. They&#x27;re affordable, pigmented and have great quality. When I saw this, I had to purchase. Indeed, it can feel dry during application but all you need is a little lip balm (I use EOS) and you&#x27;re good to go. As stated in my caption, this is only for the pink and coral tones which is great for the summer and still good for your collection in winter. At the end, I do recommend.</li>
            <li> I like these liners, I only use like 2 of them currently but as an african american woman this has a lot of color so I can fill in the brown outline I naturally have. Its also good way to tint your lip gloss</li>
            <li> Really nice colors, all good quality and in good condition. NYX is a great brand, definitely would recommend. All liners were pigmented very nicely.</li>
            <li> Excellent product worth the experience</li>
            <li> Colors are nice. They do stay on most of the day, but I like to reapply after I eat. Colors are lighter than expected, but maybe bc my skin tone is on the darker/olive side.</li>
            <li> I really like the colors, and how it does not look too bright or out of place on me. So I think it really was a great purchase.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth buying!! all 6 pencils are amazing and all shades are beautiful and they stay on for a looong time</li>
            <li> i was told it a great product they loved it. it arrived on time packaging was very good will shop again</li>
            <li> Fine pencil and nice colors. i like the colors. they are OK. Would be wonderful on a light-skinned colored person..</li>
            <li> The colors did not stay on my lip., very cheap .. And when I put this pencil on my lip it dried out my lip and the shade was gone in 5mintes</li>
            <li> i love these!! they are perfect and when they are finished i am definitely ordering again!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been impressed with this brand of cosmetics for some time now.  I love the saturation of color from these lip liner pencils.  The products arrived quickly and well-packaged.</li>
            <li> I love these liners and there really good if you don&#x27;t have the time or money to buy matching lipstick/gloss to just put it all over the lips. Beware liner and ALL liner will make your lips look dry so if you do decided to do an all over lip with the lip liner to add some chapstick .</li>
            <li> I was so excited to get this Lip liner set, but all my excitement wore off when I got them. No complaints about shipping or packaging. Arrived on time and neatly packed. But the colors are just too bright..I was looking for subtle neutral pinks and corals and was disappointed. The pencil is not creamy and does not glid smoothly. I may not use them at all..will not recommend.</li>
            <li> Just like the other liners I ordered, I love NYX make up and will order more once I run out.</li>
            <li> My lips are very sensitive to most lip products and this is the only brand I&#x27;ve found that I can wear without irritation. I have just one color now and love it so much that I want more colors... and what a deal!</li>
            <li> I bought these lip liners and another 6packs of pink-brownish ones from the same brand and I was very excited to receive these bright colors very trendy right now but instead I got another pack of different pink- brownish lip liners. The quality is great though</li>
            <li> I bought the lip liners for a young lady starting out being a makeup artist. Was a good price for all six and arrived in excellent condition, she loves them for her collection.</li>
            <li> The shipping was fast, and right when i got it i instantly tried everyone on. Im more of a matte look person so the two pencils that were shimmer-ish dont really suit me. Theyre the nude one and the light orange one.&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise! Its totally worth buying!</li>
            <li> I received before time. Happy to see them brecause they were good in quality. Coloures were also ok.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to be completely honest here: I have no idea why I bought lip liner. The only stuff I normally use on my lips is lip balm, because I am a French horn performance student and anything with colour on it automatically wipes off onto my horn mouthpiece, not to mention that I don&#x27;t actually know how to put on lip liner.&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is great, though, and very easy to apply, so even somebody who has no idea what they&#x27;re doing can still do it just fine.</li>
            <li> All the colors are very nice I was surprised, watch the type of lip stick because it makes the lips stand out more and that could turn out weird, I think lip gloss.is better with these pen as that are nice and pigmented</li>
            <li> I cannot afford to buy the MAC liners for all my lipsticks.  These work well.  I own all MAC lipsticks but not any MAC lip liners.  I find these work just fine</li>
            <li> just did not the colors for me, gave them to a friend.</li>
            <li> Just got my lip pencils an IM in love great price fast shipping.I tried on the 824 orange an IM brown skin it looks amazing...will be buying again</li>
            <li> I love these lip liners! Excellent pigment and great deal for all 6.. Highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> These lip liners are great and I recommend them to everyone! They are inexpensive and they do the job well. In fact, I often use them for my whole lip or even on my eyes!</li>
            <li> NYX Cosmetics Long Lasting Slim Lip Liner Pencils 6 Colors are amazing.</li>
            <li> I loved these but hated that there was no red color</li>
            <li> very stiff, kind of hard to put on</li>
            <li> Love the fun colors and they stay on so well. Great purchase.</li>
            <li> Wont buy this again, can only use one color that you can actually see for lining your lips. The rest of the color were &amp;#34; barely pink and barely noticeable&amp;#34;, unless you are vampire with a chalky white lips.</li>
            <li> I ordered these as a gift for a friend and the tips were broken. The wait was 3 weeks for delivery.</li>
            <li> Ok,... There really good . The only thing iCan say is iWish it was different colors . It&#x27;s just like different shades of red/pink/..</li>
            <li> By far my favorite lip liners!</li>
            <li> Great lip pencils for the price.... not dark and stays where you line your lips!  No feathering!</li>
            <li> I purchased these liners cuz I have purchased other NYX products and had very good results, specially their blushes. The price and color choices are great and I am fairly satisfied. I do wish they were a little more smoother and less dry tho. But i am happy I got them.</li>
            <li> They definitely don&#x27;t last all day. If you drink anything the color is gone. However, they are nice colors other than that little tidbit.</li>
            <li> Great quality. Long lasting color. Goes on smooth and overall great piece to my makeup collection Compairable to my Mac lip liners. Will be purchasing more of NYX products soon.</li>
            <li> nice, colors, but they are all pretty similar to each other. It&#x27;s a good deal for the money though.</li>
            <li> Great colors! hold amazing! Fill in the lips fantastic! Definitely worth the buy if you need some new lip liners!</li>
            <li> beautiful colors!  i haven&#x27;t worn them long enough to test durability, but i will say this...for the price...you do get a lot of different colors!</li>
            <li> I thought all of these were going to be matte colors because they look matte but 2 of them are sparkly and that looks horrible on me! the quality is good though..</li>
