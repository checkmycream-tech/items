            <li> it holds well and looks natural when you need the dry look....pricey, but should last a while as a little goes a long way...</li>

            <li> Works well with other products such as mouse or gel.</li>
            <li> This product can weigh hair down if you use it all over.  </li>
            <li> just a little bit...</li>

            <li> Great product, just pricey. Not sticky and easy to use. Does create volume.</li>

            <li> Have used it for yrs ,and like the product,just not the rising cost...</li>
            <li> Excellent product often hard to find.</li>
            <li> I bought one at a salon, but this one has a minty smell to it that I do not like.  Ahhh  NEW &amp; IMPROVED, I guess.</li>
            <li> I have very dry, thin, sort of wavy hair and all this did was make my hair much more frizzy</li>
            <li> Love this product, makes hair feel thick.  Will order again.</li>
            <li> I was using several different products to help with my thinning hair.  My stylist gave me a sample of this and it worked wonders!  Just a dab of this (my hair is short) and my hair looks thicker and it gives it a nice shine.  Now, instead of buying 2 or 3 different products, this is the only thing I use.</li>
            <li> great product - does what it says it will do - no sticky finish - leaves hair healthy and strong, less breakage</li>

            <li> Very impressed with this item. Was introduced to it at my local salon but couldn&#x27;t afford it at salon price. Completely satisfied with the price listing on this website! Will definitely be ordering again! Cost saving!</li>
            <li> Great product, new short hairstyle. Great price</li>

            <li> Love this stuff. Price cheaper than hair salon.</li>
            <li> just a little bit...and it does make your thinning hair look fuller ...it holds well and looks natural when you need the dry look....pricey, but should last a while as a little goes a long way...</li>
