            <li>I was thrilled when I found it.  </li>
            <li>They come in a handy container that can be carried easiy in a pocket or purse.</li>
            <li>Absolutely, without a doubt, the best toothpick there is.</li>
            <li>I have tried many varieties of plastic toothpicks that would work as a good substitute for flossing.  </li>

            <li>You&#x27;ll be most popular.</li>
            <li>I could not believe how easy and clean it feels to use this Great product.    </li>
            <li>Handy, durable, and easy to use.</li>
            <li>The are a super way to start out a good flossing.  </li>
            <li>and I was very pleased by how well it worked to clean between my teeth.  </li>
            <li>I quickly discovered that this more slender dental pick was perfect for my very closely spaced teeth.  </li>
            <li>The ridges work as well or better than floss</li>
            <li>and they are much better than toothpicks for cleaning between the teeth.  </li>
            <li>I have used several products like this one, but found Opalpix to be the best of the bunch.</li>
            <li>Neither of us were able to find them in our area</li>
            <li>These picks were recommended by our dentist and they work better than anything else we have ever used.</li>
            <li>Buy it, you&#x27;ll love it</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>I am glad to have found these on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>I love this product and was pleased to see that I could order it from Amazon, since it can&#x27;t be purchased in any retail stores.  </li>
            <li>so they remove more plaque.</li>
            <li>I love the way these flex so you can reach between teeth without gouging holes in your gums.  </li>
            <li>But I love these picks.  </li>
            <li>but after 6 months my gums were so much more heathier and much better</li>
            <li>They are the next best thing to flossing.  </li>
            <li>Great and fast shipping.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I found these toothpicks.</li>
            <li>Love them.</li>
            <li>My husband and everyone I give them to love them.</li>
            <li>Opal-pix are my favorite toothpick.</li>
            <li>Teeth are different in everyone&#x27;s mouth, and this pick works perfectly in mine.</li>
            <li>Outstanding product, have purchased this before and it performs exceedingly well.</li>
            <li>Here are the top five reasons you should buy Opalpix.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll probably like these better.</li>
            <li>It gets washed with the pants. :-)</li>
            <li>These are unlike any other toothpick type product on the market and hard to find - they are re-usable and a great design, excellent cleaning between teeth anytime and anywhere - Excellent product!!</li>
            <li>This is the best way to clean between teeth, especially teeth spaced close together.</li>
            <li>Their tapered, durable design allows me to easily get between my teeth.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use, and</li>
            <li>May not be as good as using floss but easier to use more frequently when you are where you cannot floss or brush.</li>
            <li>I  can easily get between the teeth.  </li>
            <li>That one place I could never reach is now so easy.</li>
            <li>, This is good with respect to the back teeth as the pick flexes to fit in, and get in nicely between teeth, no matter the size of the space.</li>
            <li>They are perfect for cleaning between tight teeth, they slide in and out easily and don&#x27;t splinter or get stuck.  </li>
            <li>A friend of mine introduced me to opalpics after his doctor gave him free samples.  </li>
            <li>In short Opalpics are great</li>
            <li>Cheap, disposable, conveniently packaged.  </li>
            <li>They are fabulous.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve experimented with many different solutions over the years and this is the most effective, durable and comfortable that I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li>These have a nice grip, they are very durable and flexible</li>
            <li>so flossing is important (or so I thought).  </li>
            <li>So far all my friends and family have loved them.</li>
            <li>shortly after they say &amp;#34;Wow, that really is the best toothpick&lt;br /&gt;Highly Recommend</li>
            <li>Probably going to have to buy more, I keep giving the packs away to other people that rave about how good they are.</li>
            <li>Much better that wood and so much easier on the gums.</li>
            <li>They are gentle, remove debris comfortably, and they are easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;These</li>
            <li>They work good a little pricy but ok.</li>
            <li>I became addicted to them as they fit perfectly under my bridges.  </li>
            <li>These things are just the right combination of flexibility and stiffness, if you can keep track of one, you can make it last for a good while</li>
            <li>If you like clean teeth and find flossing difficult, these Opal Pix are a good way to maintain good oral hygiene.</li>
            <li>They really work!!</li>
            <li>Best pick to pick between tough to access teeth.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, I loved this product so much I did not want to wait till the next time I went to the dentist, so looked it up on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>They are a bit pricey but totally worth it.  </li>
            <li>They are a far better product.  </li>
            <li>Most of them were too big to fit between my teeth or under my 3 tooth bridges.</li>
            <li>Very user friendly product.</li>
            <li>Love these toothpicks they are thin enough to reach perfectly between the teeth</li>
            <li>Super fast transaction.</li>
            <li>Much better than the wooden picks does not go soggy, finer for getting right between the gaps.</li>
            <li>Has good shape and gets into the tight spaces.</li>
            <li>Their slender design, flexibility and strength work better for me than wooden toothpicks.</li>
            <li>I was first given it by my dentist,</li>
            <li>U can get pretty muc anything out from between ur teeth.</li>
            <li>First received a pack in the gift bag from the dentist.  </li>
            <li>They really work!</li>
            <li>heck, I think that my teeth will be as healthy as they ever have been, as I use the picks constantly massaging my gums in between my teeth.  </li>
            <li>My oral hygienist gave me a pack of the \\&quot;opalpix\\&quot; and it did not take me long to determine these are far superior to any others I have used.  </li>
            <li>Tried many different brands and kinds and nothing beats these.  </li>
            <li>I think I first got one of these at a Health Faire at work.  </li>
            <li>Costs slightly more but multiple use makes up for it.</li>
            <li>They are very durable and worth every cent.  </li>
            <li>Much more durable than wooden toothpicks for dental care.  </li>
            <li>I am so glad i finally found these picks.</li>
            <li>have been a part of my oral care protocol for several weeks now, and I am well pleased.</li>
            <li>I love this product so much that I&#x27;m passing on the favor and constantly giving them to friends to try.</li>
            <li>Thinner than a toothpick, flat, flexible,and slightly rough, they do a great job of cleaning between teeth.</li>
            <li>The plastic is flexible yet incredibly strong, and the molded coarse surface performs wonders at controlling plaque.</li>
            <li>They also were just right for dealing with some less than perfect dental work to keep it clear of mess.  </li>
            <li>The picks that have the brush on the end may irritate at times, but these are truly smooth and fit into tight spaces.</li>
            <li>These little picks are amazing when it comes to getting stuff out from between your</li>
            <li>If you really want to be cheap about it, you can even rinse these toothpicks and re-use them for later!</li>
            <li>They work very well, and enable me to keep up my dental hygiene when away from my tooth brush.  </li>
            <li>Very flexible and thorough.</li>
            <li>You can really get between the teeth - almost like flossing...almost ;</li>
            <li>I am not being told to floss and scolded as before - thanks</li>
            <li>Overall, it&#x27;s the fit that counts,and this works for me.</li>
            <li>thank you so much.</li>
            <li>works fine (very flexible and won’t break)&lt;br /&gt;and lasts long</li>
            <li>Better than other picks and dental floss.  </li>
            <li>I originally got a sample pack from my dentist office and I searched the net until I found them.  </li>
            <li>Theses little picks are perfect for those hard to reach places that seem to catch food particles.</li>
            <li>Last but not least, the price is right!</li>
            <li>For many years I used similarly shaped wooden type toothpicks</li>
            <li>They are very useful, especially for seniors who may have gaps between their teeth and get food stuck frequently while eating.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend the Opalpix product.</li>
            <li>package is small making it very easy to carry in a purse.&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li>The price compared with other somewhat similar products is quite good and once the package is empty they are good containers for spices for those who camp and want to carry a small supply with them.  </li>
            <li>Also, when out in villages in remote areas with not much in the way of hygiene, sticking my hands into my mouth isn&#x27;t very appealing.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really like the floss because it gets messy, etc, but these were so easy</li>
            <li>then I switch to a new one.  </li>
            <li>I have all implants, couldn&#x27;t live without these.</li>
            <li>use these every day.. can&#x27;t live without them.</li>
            <li>I buy the 12-pack at a time now and even keep a new pack with me in case</li>
            <li>And to boot, the manufacturer turns out to be a manufacturer of high quality professional products for dentists.</li>
            <li>Not sure why it is not on shelves of most stores.</li>
            <li>felt it was better than any other pic I had used and definitely wanted to have a supply on hand.  </li>
            <li>I am a big fan of these, and I am a dentist;-)</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t familiar with sticking sharp objects in my mouth</li>
            <li>Just had my first dental cleaning since starting with these toothpicks-best ever report from the hygenist!  </li>
            <li>If it is left in your jeans when you wash them, it is still there &amp; clean next time you need a pick.</li>
            <li>Flexible enough to bend around teeth, but strong enough to last and not break.</li>
            <li>The slightly ribbed surface adds to the feeling of clean between teeth.</li>
            <li>They seem to go anywhere between your teeth to clear the gaps that attract food particles.</li>
            <li>Just like old smilepix.</li>
            <li>your friends take note of your frequent tooth picking;  4)</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t floss, and he sounded surprised..  </li>
            <li>Nice and thin for picking teeth.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s still worth it even if it were only a single use item.  </li>
            <li>These little swords make quick work of even the fieriest of in-between-the-teeth-food-foes.  </li>
            <li>For us, it&#x27;s the 21st century toothpick that really seems to reduce tartar with regular use.</li>
            <li>thin enough, rough enough to do a great job</li>
            <li>They are a little pricey but well worth it.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend to anyone having open spaces between their teeth, especially the rear teeth where food becomes compacted while eating.</li>
            <li>They are thin, finely ribbed for removing plaque, doubly tapered to fit between your teeth, flexible to the point of fitting between your gum and the bottom of a 3 tooth bridge, and unbreakable, and THEY ARE NOT MADE OF METAL so there&#x27;s not risk of cutting your gums.</li>
            <li>I have the last one in my supply currently thrust between my lips as I type this, after ordering a new supply from Amazon.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t use those with the little brushes and many of the picks can&#x27;t get between tight spaces, like a crown.  </li>
            <li>Like many, floss seems to shred in my teeth, or in areas with tight gaps, pop down too far when trying to get the floss between the gaps causing a small cut on my gum.  </li>

            <li> The ridges work as well or better than floss</li>
            <li> and they are much better than toothpicks for cleaning between the teeth.  </li>
            <li> I have used several products like this one, but found Opalpix to be the best of the bunch.</li>
            <li> Neither of us were able to find them in our area</li>
            <li> These picks were recommended by our dentist and they work better than anything else we have ever used.</li>
            <li> Buy it, you&#x27;ll love it</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> I am glad to have found these on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> I love this product and was pleased to see that I could order it from Amazon, since it can&#x27;t be purchased in any retail stores.  </li>
            <li> so they remove more plaque.</li>
            <li> I love the way these flex so you can reach between teeth without gouging holes in your gums.  </li>
            <li> But I love these picks.  </li>
            <li> but after 6 months my gums were so much more heathier and much better</li>
            <li> They are the next best thing to flossing.  </li>
            <li> Great and fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I found these toothpicks.</li>
            <li> Love them.</li>
            <li> My husband and everyone I give them to love them.</li>
            <li> Opal-pix are my favorite toothpick.</li>
            <li> Teeth are different in everyone&#x27;s mouth, and this pick works perfectly in mine.</li>
            <li> Outstanding product, have purchased this before and it performs exceedingly well.</li>
            <li> Here are the top five reasons you should buy Opalpix.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll probably like these better.</li>
            <li> It gets washed with the pants. :-)</li>
            <li> These are unlike any other toothpick type product on the market and hard to find - they are re-usable and a great design, excellent cleaning between teeth anytime and anywhere - Excellent product!!</li>
            <li> This is the best way to clean between teeth, especially teeth spaced close together.</li>
            <li> Their tapered, durable design allows me to easily get between my teeth.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use, and</li>
            <li> May not be as good as using floss but easier to use more frequently when you are where you cannot floss or brush.</li>
            <li> I  can easily get between the teeth.  </li>
            <li> That one place I could never reach is now so easy.</li>
            <li> , This is good with respect to the back teeth as the pick flexes to fit in, and get in nicely between teeth, no matter the size of the space.</li>
            <li> They are perfect for cleaning between tight teeth, they slide in and out easily and don&#x27;t splinter or get stuck.  </li>
            <li> A friend of mine introduced me to opalpics after his doctor gave him free samples.  </li>
            <li> In short Opalpics are great</li>
            <li> Cheap, disposable, conveniently packaged.  </li>
            <li> They are fabulous.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve experimented with many different solutions over the years and this is the most effective, durable and comfortable that I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li> These have a nice grip, they are very durable and flexible</li>
            <li> so flossing is important (or so I thought).  </li>
            <li> So far all my friends and family have loved them.</li>
            <li> shortly after they say &amp;#34;Wow, that really is the best toothpick&lt;br /&gt;Highly Recommend</li>
            <li> Probably going to have to buy more, I keep giving the packs away to other people that rave about how good they are.</li>
            <li> Much better that wood and so much easier on the gums.</li>
            <li> They are gentle, remove debris comfortably, and they are easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;These</li>
            <li> They work good a little pricy but ok.</li>
            <li> I became addicted to them as they fit perfectly under my bridges.  </li>
            <li> These things are just the right combination of flexibility and stiffness, if you can keep track of one, you can make it last for a good while</li>
            <li> If you like clean teeth and find flossing difficult, these Opal Pix are a good way to maintain good oral hygiene.</li>
            <li> They really work!!</li>
            <li> Best pick to pick between tough to access teeth.</li>
            <li> Meanwhile, I loved this product so much I did not want to wait till the next time I went to the dentist, so looked it up on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> They are a bit pricey but totally worth it.  </li>
            <li> They are a far better product.  </li>
            <li> Most of them were too big to fit between my teeth or under my 3 tooth bridges.</li>
            <li> Very user friendly product.</li>
            <li> Love these toothpicks they are thin enough to reach perfectly between the teeth</li>
            <li> Super fast transaction.</li>
            <li> Much better than the wooden picks does not go soggy, finer for getting right between the gaps.</li>
            <li> Has good shape and gets into the tight spaces.</li>
            <li> Their slender design, flexibility and strength work better for me than wooden toothpicks.</li>
            <li> I was first given it by my dentist,</li>
            <li> U can get pretty muc anything out from between ur teeth.</li>
            <li> First received a pack in the gift bag from the dentist.  </li>
            <li> They really work!</li>
            <li> heck, I think that my teeth will be as healthy as they ever have been, as I use the picks constantly massaging my gums in between my teeth.  </li>
            <li> My oral hygienist gave me a pack of the \\&quot;opalpix\\&quot; and it did not take me long to determine these are far superior to any others I have used.  </li>
            <li> Tried many different brands and kinds and nothing beats these.  </li>
            <li> I think I first got one of these at a Health Faire at work.  </li>
            <li> Costs slightly more but multiple use makes up for it.</li>
            <li> They are very durable and worth every cent.  </li>
            <li> Much more durable than wooden toothpicks for dental care.  </li>
            <li> I am so glad i finally found these picks.</li>
            <li> have been a part of my oral care protocol for several weeks now, and I am well pleased.</li>
            <li> I love this product so much that I&#x27;m passing on the favor and constantly giving them to friends to try.</li>
            <li> Thinner than a toothpick, flat, flexible,and slightly rough, they do a great job of cleaning between teeth.</li>
            <li> The plastic is flexible yet incredibly strong, and the molded coarse surface performs wonders at controlling plaque.</li>
            <li> They also were just right for dealing with some less than perfect dental work to keep it clear of mess.  </li>
            <li> The picks that have the brush on the end may irritate at times, but these are truly smooth and fit into tight spaces.</li>
            <li> These little picks are amazing when it comes to getting stuff out from between your</li>
            <li> If you really want to be cheap about it, you can even rinse these toothpicks and re-use them for later!</li>
            <li> They work very well, and enable me to keep up my dental hygiene when away from my tooth brush.  </li>
            <li> Very flexible and thorough.</li>
            <li> You can really get between the teeth - almost like flossing...almost ;</li>
            <li> I am not being told to floss and scolded as before - thanks</li>
            <li> Overall, it&#x27;s the fit that counts,and this works for me.</li>
            <li> thank you so much.</li>
            <li> works fine (very flexible and won’t break)&lt;br /&gt;and lasts long</li>
            <li> Better than other picks and dental floss.  </li>
            <li> I originally got a sample pack from my dentist office and I searched the net until I found them.  </li>
            <li> Theses little picks are perfect for those hard to reach places that seem to catch food particles.</li>
            <li> Last but not least, the price is right!</li>
            <li> For many years I used similarly shaped wooden type toothpicks</li>
            <li> They are very useful, especially for seniors who may have gaps between their teeth and get food stuck frequently while eating.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend the Opalpix product.</li>
            <li> package is small making it very easy to carry in a purse.&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li> The price compared with other somewhat similar products is quite good and once the package is empty they are good containers for spices for those who camp and want to carry a small supply with them.  </li>
            <li> Also, when out in villages in remote areas with not much in the way of hygiene, sticking my hands into my mouth isn&#x27;t very appealing.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really like the floss because it gets messy, etc, but these were so easy</li>
            <li> then I switch to a new one.  </li>
            <li> I have all implants, couldn&#x27;t live without these.</li>
            <li> use these every day.. can&#x27;t live without them.</li>
            <li> I buy the 12-pack at a time now and even keep a new pack with me in case</li>
            <li> And to boot, the manufacturer turns out to be a manufacturer of high quality professional products for dentists.</li>
            <li> Not sure why it is not on shelves of most stores.</li>
            <li> felt it was better than any other pic I had used and definitely wanted to have a supply on hand.  </li>
            <li> I am a big fan of these, and I am a dentist;-)</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t familiar with sticking sharp objects in my mouth</li>
            <li> Just had my first dental cleaning since starting with these toothpicks-best ever report from the hygenist!  </li>
            <li> If it is left in your jeans when you wash them, it is still there &amp; clean next time you need a pick.</li>
            <li> Flexible enough to bend around teeth, but strong enough to last and not break.</li>
            <li> The slightly ribbed surface adds to the feeling of clean between teeth.</li>
            <li> They seem to go anywhere between your teeth to clear the gaps that attract food particles.</li>
            <li> Just like old smilepix.</li>
            <li> your friends take note of your frequent tooth picking;  4)</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t floss, and he sounded surprised..  </li>
            <li> Nice and thin for picking teeth.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s still worth it even if it were only a single use item.  </li>
            <li> These little swords make quick work of even the fieriest of in-between-the-teeth-food-foes.  </li>
            <li> For us, it&#x27;s the 21st century toothpick that really seems to reduce tartar with regular use.</li>
            <li> thin enough, rough enough to do a great job</li>
            <li> They are a little pricey but well worth it.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend to anyone having open spaces between their teeth, especially the rear teeth where food becomes compacted while eating.</li>
            <li> They are thin, finely ribbed for removing plaque, doubly tapered to fit between your teeth, flexible to the point of fitting between your gum and the bottom of a 3 tooth bridge, and unbreakable, and THEY ARE NOT MADE OF METAL so there&#x27;s not risk of cutting your gums.</li>
            <li> I have the last one in my supply currently thrust between my lips as I type this, after ordering a new supply from Amazon.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t use those with the little brushes and many of the picks can&#x27;t get between tight spaces, like a crown.  </li>
            <li> Like many, floss seems to shred in my teeth, or in areas with tight gaps, pop down too far when trying to get the floss between the gaps causing a small cut on my gum.  </li>
            <li> It works much better than a toothpick, almost like flossing, except that it is in a plastic form and very thin</li>
            <li> Far surpasses any other type of toothpicks.  </li>
            <li> Since they come 32 to a container, with 12 containers in a pack, they will last a long time, too.</li>
            <li> Now i have them, and i could never live without them.</li>
            <li> One package lasts a very long time!</li>
            <li> I never really liked the wooden ones, they were just to big</li>
            <li> A friend was visiting me and we were talking about dental hygiene and all the time we had spent at the dentist.  </li>
            <li> I prefer these to other pics or dental floss.</li>
            <li> I was never able to find them in the regular stores</li>
            <li> Better than flossing, and I hate flossing.</li>
            <li> I just had a teeth cleaning this week and it took less than a half hour with no gum or tooth problems reported.  </li>
            <li> I purchased these initially for my husband who was seeking a sturdier sort of triangular shaped version of an dental pick so the only reason this got a four star was that it was so difficult to determine the shape of the product off their site.  </li>
            <li> They do the job but were not like the picks I got from my previous dentist.</li>
            <li> These little sticks work, my doctor was amazed at how well it cleans the placque build up off your teeth.</li>
            <li> These little guys are just what the doctor ordered.</li>
            <li> I hate to floss (even though I recommend it), and these pix fit through even the tightest spaces.  </li>
            <li> I always hated flossing because the various flosses would either break or, worse yet, disintegrate/shred in my mouth when I used them, leaving fine fibers stuck between my teeth.</li>
            <li> Along with being extra thin they are rigid as well unlike other thin picks.  </li>
            <li> No more product stuck between teeth.</li>
            <li> You keep one in the small change/watch pocket on your jeans.</li>
            <li> I cannot believe how well it works to really get in between teeth without stabbing or bending!</li>
            <li> I have a couple of areas in my mouth that are hard to floss with, my dentist showed me these</li>
            <li> but they were a bit too thick</li>
            <li> and I because my teeth are closely spaced that was not good.  </li>
            <li> Give em a try you won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
            <li> 1) every meal makes your mouth feel uncomfortable; 2) you have toothpicks everywhere - in your car, on your desk, in your pockets;  </li>
            <li> I was told they were difficult to find</li>
            <li> For years I have been frustrated with floss that just shredded or got caught up between some of my teeth but</li>
            <li> , I absolutely hate flossing because of the floss snapping and getting wedged in my teeth.</li>
            <li> I hate flossing and my dentist knew it.  </li>
            <li> I hate flossing.  </li>

            <li> Gotta bring these in my car! only way to go!</li>
            <li> If you like clean teeth and find flossing difficult, these Opal Pix are a good way to maintain good oral hygiene.</li>
            <li> Only thing to use.  Forget wood toothpicks.</li>
            <li> Opalpix was recommended by my dental hygienist. In combination with flossing it&#x27;s giving me healthier gums at my dental checkups.</li>
            <li> works fine (very flexible and won’t break)&lt;br /&gt;and lasts long</li>
            <li> Much better than the wooden picks does not go soggy, finer for getting right between the gaps. Reusable last longer.</li>
            <li> These things are just the right combination of flexibility and stiffness, if you can keep track of one, you can make it last for a good while, I absolutely hate flossing because of the floss snapping and getting wedged in my teeth. I can do this whilst driving. The ease of use promotes good dental hygiene.</li>
            <li> My dentist used to give these out in her goodie bag for patients.  I became addicted to them as they fit perfectly under my bridges.  The ridges work as well or better than floss and they are much better than toothpicks for cleaning between the teeth.  After she quit giving them away I finally found them on Amazon.  They are a little pricey but well worth it.</li>
            <li> Opalpix were recommended by my dentist to supplement flossing.  They have serrations on both sides (like a file) to \\&quot;scrape\\&quot; off plaque.  They really work!!</li>
            <li> I have used several products like this one, but found Opalpix to be the best of the bunch.</li>
            <li> For many years I used similarly shaped wooden type toothpicks but they were a bit too thick and I because my teeth are closely spaced that was not good.  These opalpics are thinner yet plenty ridgit for the task.    A friend of mine introduced me to opalpics after his doctor gave him free samples.  Neither of us were able to find them in our area so I got online and found them at Amazon.  In short Opalpics are great and so too is Amazon.  Jim</li>
            <li> These picks were recommended by our dentist and they work better than anything else we have ever used.</li>
            <li> Works well. Has good shape and gets into the tight spaces. Flexible enough to bend around teeth, but strong enough to last and not break.</li>
            <li> I received a sample of the Opalpix from my dentist, and liked them so well I searched several stores to find them.  I didn&#x27;t have any luck in the stores, but Amazon had them!  I re-use the picks rather than throwing them out after each use in an effort to reduce landfill contributions.  They work very well, and enable me to keep up my dental hygiene when away from my tooth brush.  Their slender design, flexibility and strength work better for me than wooden toothpicks.</li>
            <li> Nice and thin for picking teeth.</li>
            <li> Opalpix is a great product. No more product stuck between teeth. Handy, durable, and easy to use. Very user friendly product.</li>
            <li> This is the best way to clean between teeth, especially teeth spaced close together. Does not bend, does not break.  Absolute best. Not sure why it is not on shelves of most stores.</li>
            <li> Best tooth pick I have ever used.  Cheap, disposable, conveniently packaged.  Also - FUNCTIONAL.  Buy it, you&#x27;ll love it</li>
            <li> I love this product.  A friend was visiting me and we were talking about dental hygiene and all the time we had spent at the dentist.  He told me I had to try these pixs.  I assured him I had tried every pix, floss etc. out there.  But, he insisted I try this and gave me a box.  I had not tried it and I was very pleased by how well it worked to clean between my teeth.  I looked for them at drug stores and could not find them. I had an appointment with my dental hygienist the next week and brought the box into her and asked if she had them. She had never seen them. I gave some to her to try. She said that she would order them.  Meanwhile, I loved this product so much I did not want to wait till the next time I went to the dentist, so looked it up on Amazon.  I was thrilled when I found it.  I love this product so much that I&#x27;m passing on the favor and constantly giving them to friends to try.</li>
            <li> My dentist gives these out after check ups and cleanings.  I am hooked!  I am glad to have found these on Amazon.  They are a bit pricey but totally worth it.  I carry them in my purse at all times.  Whenever someone needs a toothpick I pass them out.  So far all my friends and family have loved them.</li>
            <li> These are the best toothpicks I have ever used.  I hate to floss (even though I recommend it), and these pix fit through even the tightest spaces.  Very flexible and thorough.</li>
            <li> I love this product and was pleased to see that I could order it from Amazon, since it can&#x27;t be purchased in any retail stores.  I was first given it by my dentist, felt it was better than any other pic I had used and definitely wanted to have a supply on hand.  I will continue to purchase it as needed.</li>
            <li> Love these toothpicks they are thin enough to reach perfectly between the teeth and they are abrasive so they remove more plaque.</li>
            <li> They work awesome , I can use thm anywhere I go because they have a convenient holding case. U can get pretty muc anything out from between ur teeth. I luv em.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t get them here so I was happy that I was able to order them thru Amazon. You can really get between the teeth - almost like flossing...almost ;o)</li>
            <li> This product was recommended to me by a friend. It works much better than a toothpick, almost like flossing, except that it is in a plastic form and very thin so it glides in-between teeth very easily. They come in a handy container that can be carried easiy in a pocket or purse. Fantastic product!!!!</li>
            <li> My girlfriend, Sharie Opal, gave me an OpalPix to try.  They are fabulous.  She is hooked on them and now so am I.  I can&#x27;t believe I have just now heard of them.  They are perfect for cleaning between tight teeth, they slide in and out easily and don&#x27;t splinter or get stuck.  I plan on spreading the word to all my friends.</li>
            <li> I love the way these flex so you can reach between teeth without gouging holes in your gums.  The slightly ribbed surface adds to the feeling of clean between teeth.</li>
            <li> First received a pack in the gift bag from the dentist.  I have one place in the back where food gets caught, and I started using them.  They worked great, and because they are plastic, I started using it between all my teeth.  When I went in for a cleaning, the tech said my gum health had improved, and I do not floss often.</li>
            <li> These are unlike any other toothpick type product on the market and hard to find - they are re-usable and a great design, excellent cleaning between teeth anytime and anywhere - Excellent product!!</li>
            <li> Great Product everone loved them.</li>
            <li> Absolutely, without a doubt, the best toothpick there is.</li>
            <li> Really great product! I prefer these to other pics or dental floss. They really work!</li>
            <li> I hate flossing and my dentist knew it.  His assistant then gave me a package of Opalpix a couple years ago.  They told me if I used them after every meal I could skip the floss.  Their tapered, durable design allows me to easily get between my teeth.  I now order them by the 12 pk.  I use them at home just prior to using my ultrasonic toothbrush.  I just had a teeth cleaning this week and it took less than a half hour with no gum or tooth problems reported.  My wife now carries a pack of Opalpix in her purse for use anytime.  For us, it&#x27;s the 21st century toothpick that really seems to reduce tartar with regular use.</li>
            <li> Our dentist used to give these out at the end of each visit, and we learned to rely on these around the house. Then the freebies stopped, and so now we have a LIFETIME supply. One package lasts a very long time!</li>
            <li> I hate flossing.  I wont do it.  Nope.  Not gonna happen.  But I love these picks.  Easy to use, and heck, I think that my teeth will be as healthy as they ever have been, as I use the picks constantly massaging my gums in between my teeth.  hooray for good, convenient oral hygiene.  I have been using the same pick for 3 days now, so I dont see a need to buy from Amazon yet, but if I get close to running out, you can bet that this will be a verified review!!!</li>
            <li> These little picks are amazing when it comes to getting stuff out from between your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;The package is small making it very easy to carry in a purse.&lt;br /&gt;Love this product.</li>
            <li> My Dentist was aways on me to floss, but I cannot stand flossing. He gave me these picks. My gums would bleed at cleanings before I had them but after 6 months my gums were so much more heathier and much better</li>
            <li> I was initially introduced to the Opalpix by my dentist and have used them for years. Along with being extra thin they are rigid as well unlike other thin picks.  They don&#x27;t splinter like wood.  Since the order was 12 Pack I gave members of my family and neighbors each a box.  I would highly recommend to anyone having open spaces between their teeth, especially the rear teeth where food becomes compacted while eating.</li>
            <li> I have tried many varieties of plastic toothpicks that would work as a good substitute for flossing.  Like many, floss seems to shred in my teeth, or in areas with tight gaps, pop down too far when trying to get the floss between the gaps causing a small cut on my gum.  Also, when out in villages in remote areas with not much in the way of hygiene, sticking my hands into my mouth isn&#x27;t very appealing.  My oral hygienist gave me a pack of the \\&quot;opalpix\\&quot; and it did not take me long to determine these are far superior to any others I have used.  I have the last one in my supply currently thrust between my lips as I type this, after ordering a new supply from Amazon. Great product that I can now give away to others for their enjoyment as well.  Can&#x27;t wait until my next 6 months visit for a teeth cleaning so I can see if the plaque removal is as good as I believe it to be!</li>
            <li> Best toothpicks ever invented.  Period.  Tried many different brands and kinds and nothing beats these.  They are the next best thing to flossing.  You won&#x27;t regret buying them.</li>
            <li> Great for carrying along when traveling.  Disposable and doesn&#x27;t take up a lot of room in the luggage, purse or pocket</li>
            <li> These are the BEST!!!    I could not believe how easy and clean it feels to use this Great product.    Thank You,  Marsh  [...]</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t do without them. My Dentist said to get them.&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
            <li> I think I first got one of these at a Health Faire at work.  I LOVED them.. I don&#x27;t really like the floss because it gets messy, etc, but these were so easy and they did the job!  I was never able to find them in the regular stores so I bought them through Amazon!  I am very pleased!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why these are not sold in stores.  They are a far better product.  I can&#x27;t use those with the little brushes and many of the picks can&#x27;t get between tight spaces, like a crown.  I won&#x27;t use anything else. Super fast transaction.</li>
            <li> I always hated flossing because the various flosses would either break or, worse yet, disintegrate/shred in my mouth when I used them, leaving fine fibers stuck between my teeth. 10 years ago, I switched to flexible toothpicks that I could buy over the counter at the pharmacy. Most of them were too big to fit between my teeth or under my 3 tooth bridges. Then about 5 years ago, I was given a sample of Opalpix by the hygenist after a tooth cleaning appointment. They are thin, finely ribbed for removing plaque, doubly tapered to fit between your teeth, flexible to the point of fitting between your gum and the bottom of a 3 tooth bridge, and unbreakable, and THEY ARE NOT MADE OF METAL so there&#x27;s not risk of cutting your gums. The problem was they were not sold in stores. After scouring the web, I found that the manufacturer sells them on the web in 12 pack cases(a year&#x27;s supply) for under $20 including shipping [[ASIN:B002E7AIK4 Opalpix 32ct., 12pk]]. And to boot, the manufacturer turns out to be a manufacturer of high quality professional products for dentists. I use them every day and even give them to friends, because I know they&#x27;ll use them if they try them. Try them and you&#x27;ll never go back to floss.</li>
            <li> Just like old smilepix. Great and fast shipping. Thank you</li>
            <li> I am a big fan of these, and I am a dentist;-)</li>
            <li> thin enough, rough enough to do a great job</li>
            <li> The best toothpick ever</li>
            <li> These are by far the greatest oral pics that I have ever used! I have tried them all, wood, plastic, built in floss, you name it, these are the best! The plastic is flexible yet incredibly strong, and the molded coarse surface performs wonders at controlling plaque. Give em a try you won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
            <li> Costs slightly more but multiple use makes up for it. It&#x27;s still worth it even if it were only a single use item.  A superior product.</li>
            <li> I purchased these initially for my husband who was seeking a sturdier sort of triangular shaped version of an dental pick so the only reason this got a four star was that it was so difficult to determine the shape of the product off their site.  I quickly discovered that this more slender dental pick was perfect for my very closely spaced teeth.  For years I have been frustrated with floss that just shredded or got caught up between some of my teeth but these slide nicely between them at the gumline and allow me to disturb food debris there. They also were just right for dealing with some less than perfect dental work to keep it clear of mess.  Now I carry some in my purse as once I indulged I find I can&#x27;t stand the feel of stuff stuck anywhere in my teeth.  The price compared with other somewhat similar products is quite good and once the package is empty they are good containers for spices for those who camp and want to carry a small supply with them.  Packaging was good.  Delivery was prompt.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I found these toothpicks. I never really liked the wooden ones, they were just to big and they always broke, these are perfect for getting in between the teeth.</li>
            <li> They work good a little pricy but ok.</li>
            <li> It also is recommended by my dentist as a way to improve personal dental hygiene as flossing can miss some tartar.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve experimented with many different solutions over the years and this is the most effective, durable and comfortable that I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li> What a great invention</li>
            <li> Great product! I continue to order and everyone in family uses these pix!</li>
            <li> These little swords make quick work of even the fieriest of in-between-the-teeth-food-foes.  They are very durable and worth every cent.  Buy some for your friends birthdays!  Pass them out with Halloween candy (to the parents)!  You&#x27;ll be most popular.</li>
            <li> Flossing doesn&#x27;t work for me but these are great!</li>
            <li> A dentist turned me on to these tooth picks. You keep one in the small change/watch pocket on your jeans. They are reusable &amp; last forever. If it is left in your jeans when you wash them, it is still there &amp; clean next time you need a pick.</li>
            <li> Much more durable than wooden toothpicks for dental care.  I would recommend these to anyone who likes to use toothpick type implements in addition to dental floss.</li>
            <li> Love them. They are the best \\&quot;tooth picks\\&quot; I&#x27;ve ever found. My husband and everyone I give them to love them. My son and his wife wanted to know where we got them so he could order some.</li>
            <li> Excellent toothpick. I cannot believe how well it works to really get in between teeth without stabbing or bending! If you really want to be cheap about it, you can even rinse these toothpicks and re-use them for later!</li>
            <li> Received timely .Just as described .</li>
            <li> I use these all the time instead of floss and my dentist is seeing the difference and me too at cleaning times.  I am not being told to floss and scolded as before - thanks</li>
            <li> These little sticks work, my doctor was amazed at how well it cleans the placque build up off your teeth. One stick will work for about a month then I switch to a new one.  The box I ordered should last a couple of years.</li>
            <li> Like how these work for my teeth.  Better than other picks and dental floss.  Bought the 12 pak to have them where I need them when I need them.</li>
            <li> These little guys are just what the doctor ordered. Theses little picks are perfect for those hard to reach places that seem to catch food particles. Much better that wood and so much easier on the gums. I recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Great product.  Wouldn&#x27;t be without them.  Handy plastic case.  Always keep one in the car.</li>
            <li> Opal-pix are my favorite toothpick. Teeth are different in everyone&#x27;s mouth, and this pick works perfectly in mine. They&#x27;re sturdy, and can be washed and re-used, if you are so inclined to that type of frugality. Overall, it&#x27;s the fit that counts,and this works for me.</li>
            <li> May not be as good as using floss but easier to use more frequently when you are where you cannot floss or brush.</li>
            <li> I have a couple of areas in my mouth that are hard to floss with, my dentist showed me these and they work great so I ordered a buch.</li>
            <li> There is a bit of a learning curve here.  Wasn&#x27;t familiar with sticking sharp objects in my mouth but I figured it out and wouldn&#x27;t be without them now.</li>
            <li> I carry opalpix in my pocket wherever I go and give packets to others when they see me using mine.  They are very useful, especially for seniors who may have gaps between their teeth and get food stuck frequently while eating.</li>
            <li> These have a nice grip, they are very durable and flexible, This is good with respect to the back teeth as the pick flexes to fit in, and get in nicely between teeth, no matter the size of the space. I also like the Doctors brushpicks because they have a fishbone like end they seem to grab the food between your teeth, though these seem gentler on your gums.</li>
            <li> Since I have braces, this takes the place of dental floss. I  can easily get between the teeth.  It saves time &amp; effort.</li>
            <li> An awesome product to keep in your car&#x27;s glovebox.  Great for getting things out of your teeth while on the go.</li>
            <li> Outstanding product, have purchased this before and it performs exceedingly well. Gave some to friends who loved it.</li>
            <li> We were introduced to this product at our dentist&#x27;s office, and then they quit carrying it. Thinner than a toothpick, flat, flexible,and slightly rough, they do a great job of cleaning between teeth. Since they come 32 to a container, with 12 containers in a pack, they will last a long time, too.</li>
            <li> These are really great!  Here are the top five reasons you should buy Opalpix.  If any of them apply, you won&#x27;t regret the purchase! 1) every meal makes your mouth feel uncomfortable; 2) you have toothpicks everywhere - in your car, on your desk, in your pockets;  3) your friends take note of your frequent tooth picking;  4) you are a regular customer at the periodontist;  5) you sometimes think replacing all of your teeth with dentures is the way to go.</li>
            <li> They do the job but were not like the picks I got from my previous dentist. I guess after I use them awhile and get used to them I&#x27;ll probably like these better. 😄</li>
            <li> Day da bes. One two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen fifteen sixteen seventeen.</li>
            <li> I am so glad i finally found these picks. Got some from my dentist and have been looking for them every since i got them. Now i have them, and i could never live without them. They are perfect. thank you so much. Great price</li>
            <li> I told my dentist I don&#x27;t floss, and he sounded surprised..  I showed them these and told him he should order some for his patients.  He made a note of it.</li>
            <li> My dentist hands these out but I can only find them on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;I sometimes ask friends :Want to try the best toothpick&amp;#34; and they are always like...&amp;#34;whatever&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;Then shortly after they say &amp;#34;Wow, that really is the best toothpick&lt;br /&gt;Highly Recommend</li>
            <li> Best pick to pick between tough to access teeth. That one place I could never reach is now so easy.</li>
            <li> I have all implants, couldn&#x27;t live without these.</li>
            <li> Just had my first dental cleaning since starting with these toothpicks-best ever report from the hygenist!  And I have veneers on the front, so flossing is important (or so I thought).  Better than flossing, and I hate flossing.</li>
            <li> use these every day.. can&#x27;t live without them.</li>
            <li> My dental hygienist gave me a pack.  The are a super way to start out a good flossing.  I was told they were difficult to find so I bought a 12 pack.  Probably going to have to buy more, I keep giving the packs away to other people that rave about how good they are.</li>
            <li> These are the very best picks I have ever used.  They are gentle, remove debris comfortably, and they are easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;These have been a part of my oral care protocol for several weeks now, and I am well pleased. The picks that have the brush on the end may irritate at times, but these are truly smooth and fit into tight spaces. Last but not least, the price is right!</li>
            <li> They work great to remove food and slide easily between your teeth.  Almost as good as using dental floss for cleaning.</li>
            <li> My wife and I keep these in multiple locations. Vehicles, travel bags, home bathrooms, and boat. When traveling I keep one pick in the back pocket of my pants. It gets washed with the pants. :-)</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to ANYONE having teeth!!!  Far surpasses any other type of toothpicks.  Some of the perks to using Opalpix, is that it massages the gum line while helping to remove plaque and cleans in between teeth.  I originally got a sample pack from my dentist office and I searched the net until I found them.  I buy the 12-pack at a time now and even keep a new pack with me in case I meet up with some one and they want to try them too!  A Seriously good product!</li>
            <li> This was perfect for me.</li>
            <li> My dentist gave me a sample of Opalpix and they are great. They seem to go anywhere between your teeth to clear the gaps that attract food particles. I highly recommend the Opalpix product.</li>
