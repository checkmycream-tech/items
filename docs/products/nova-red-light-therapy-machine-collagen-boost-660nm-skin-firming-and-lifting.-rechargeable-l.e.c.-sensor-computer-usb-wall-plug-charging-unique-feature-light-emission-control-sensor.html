            <li>Ultimately, it&#x27;s your desire to want to look beautiful that works.</li>
            <li>Another great thing about Nova Red, is that it&#x27;s cheaper than Tanda, but the Tanda feels cheaper...</li>
            <li>LED light therapy as it is hand held.</li>
            <li>I was very pleased  with  the results I have gotten so far</li>
            <li>Good tool in her facial kit.</li>
            <li>Since the skin is a reflection of health, eating a balanced diet with supplements (for most people, there is no guarantee that they can get all the vitamins and minerals from the food sources daily), drinking sufficient water, sleeping well, exercising (yoga is great), detoxing your body constantly, and cleaning your face thoroughly every day will absolutely make beautiful skin possible.</li>
            <li>If you are patient, you will most likely be satisfied.</li>
            <li>If you use it regularly you can see and improvement and  your skin looks more healthy.</li>
            <li>I feel very confident in recommending the Nova Red to anyone looking to improve their skin.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t seen anything exciting happen to my skin yet.</li>
            <li>it only worked twice(cuz it was old) and then burned out, but I never forgot how great I looked afterward</li>
            <li>Very easy to use and the charge last for months.</li>
            <li>Face looks more youthful and eye, mouth lines are less prominent.  </li>
            <li>, I did not, I am very responsible person and never will tell a lie about this inexpensive item.</li>
            <li>This is a great little device for red light therapy</li>
            <li>Just used for first time.</li>
            <li>Need something larger is ok for on the go</li>
            <li>When you give out love and appreciation, you get the same in return from all sources.</li>
            <li>Mostly, it has diminished the bright red of my rosa eat and the veins look less red and disappearing.  </li>
            <li>I just fit it in to my daily routine</li>
            <li>The wrinkles there just don&#x27;t get deeper and are much lighter to be like expression lines.</li>
            <li>Because you can manifest what you really want in life.</li>
            <li>You really get what you give out.</li>
            <li>Love this light Therapy machine; have been using it every other day for the last 10 days and can already see the difference.</li>
            <li>I noticed that my wrinkles between the eyebrows and under the eyes are not noticeable any more, and the dark spots are lighter.   </li>
            <li>When the body internal environment is full of toxins, they will come out through the skin as well.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used this product long enough to determine if it works or not, but it is very easy to use....</li>
            <li>Now I have this one and after a few treatments I can&#x27;t believe how much better my skin looks.</li>
            <li>The Tanda broke after two months and had a smaller surface area, hence took longer to do my whole face.</li>
            <li>Years ago my friend gave me an old redlight machine from another beauty company...</li>
            <li>So far, have not notice any difference on my skin.</li>
            <li>Animal fat caused clogged pores that prevents water and oil from coming up to the surface naturally to moisturize the skin.</li>
            <li>Because when my pores are cleaned, water and oil can come up from underneath the skin to moisturize it naturally.</li>
            <li>For skin firmness is more slow to see the effect.</li>
            <li>The two dark spots on my left cheek and crowfeet area are much lighter now (they have been there for more than 20 years due to sun exposure).</li>
            <li>I am 68 and lines only at corners of mouth with a few fine lines at corner of eyes.  </li>
            <li>and I feel it&#x27;s worth the time and is money way better spent than on any expensive creams that do nothing!</li>
            <li>I will continue using this machine, two cycles every night after washing face (I use an ice cube to rub all over my face after washing face to let it dry out naturally.</li>

            <li> It is also  much much less expensive than those &amp;#34;medical&amp;#34; ones that are manufactured in  the same way at $400 to $600.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for just a few days now and have noticed an improvement in my skin already!</li>
            <li> When you get there, you&#x27;ll know what I mean.</li>
            <li> The cold temperature from the ice can close the pores.)  </li>

            <li> Haven&#x27;t seen anything exciting happen to my skin yet. Been 2months or more</li>
            <li> I am 68 and lines only at corners of mouth with a few fine lines at corner of eyes.  Mostly, it has diminished the bright red of my rosa eat and the veins look less red and disappearing.  Face looks more youthful and eye, mouth lines are less prominent.  It is a miracle tool!  I can imagine what it would do for a woman in 30, 40 and 50&#x27;s.  Take a before pic...you will be amazed!  Go for it.</li>
            <li> This is a great little device for red light therapy</li>
            <li> easy to use. noticing results</li>
            <li> Just used for first time. Easy, fingers crossed for good results</li>
            <li> I used this product for some months. I had hope to reduce my dark spots on my face that i got after my pregnancy years ago. I beleive it improves a little bit the appareance of face, but my wrinkles and dark spots remain exactly the same.&lt;br /&gt;Actualization october 2017. In fact my family say that i got more pigmentation in my face. I recommend do not use this product if you have melasma or dark spots because it can be increase. Beware</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for just a few days now and have noticed an improvement in my skin already! I am 41 and a Spaniard. I have fair to medium color skin. My skin looks plumper and my pores are not as obvious. Alos, my skin looks a bit tighter. I have tried the Tanda Luxe before and had good results, but I like this machine way better. The Tanda broke after two months and had a smaller surface area, hence took longer to do my whole face. I&#x27;ve been using the Nova Red twice a day, as I feel it works faster this way. Another great thing about Nova Red, is that it&#x27;s cheaper than Tanda, but the Tanda feels cheaper... I should mention i&#x27;ve also had med spa laser treatments and I haven&#x27;t noticed that it&#x27;s any better than the at home devices. I just fit it in to my daily routine and I feel it&#x27;s worth the time and is money way better spent than on any expensive creams that do nothing! I feel very confident in recommending the Nova Red to anyone looking to improve their skin.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used this product long enough to determine if it works or not, but it is very easy to use....</li>
            <li> Love this light Therapy machine; have been using it every other day for the last 10 days and can already see the difference. Arrived promptly and at the best price. Very happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> A gift for my wife. She says it is &amp;#34;clearly&amp;#34; working well! Good tool in her facial kit.</li>
            <li> I love this Light. I feel and look 10 years younger.</li>
            <li> Wow I&#x27;m impressed! Years ago my friend gave me an old redlight machine from another beauty company...it only worked twice(cuz it was old) and then burned out, but I never forgot how great I looked afterward( of course My skin was a lot better years ago) Now I&#x27;m in the &amp;#34;AND OVER&amp;#34; category age wise, and decided to find one that fits my budget...Now I have this one and after a few treatments I can&#x27;t believe how much better my skin looks. I imagine I will have to use this everyday for life...but it&#x27;s relaxing so who cares laying on the couch watching TV.... this thing works....! At the price you can&#x27;t beat it...some of the same wattage machines cost up to 700 bucks...buy this...unless you need a face lift and you have sagging jowls and need to see the Doctor for that.... but for the fine lines...this is the best!</li>
            <li> Frame came apart, could be that mine were damaged. I will not order again, the seller told me that I broke it, I did not, I am very responsible person and never will tell a lie about this inexpensive item. I still used it but have to be careful. So far, have not notice any difference on my skin.</li>
            <li> It does seem to make wrinkles less visible, but is time consuming.  If you are patient, you will most likely be satisfied.</li>
            <li> If you use it regularly you can see and improvement and  your skin looks more healthy. Very easy to use and the charge last for months. For skin firmness is more slow to see the effect.</li>
            <li> I feel 100% better about my appearance since I started using this.  Highest praise!!!! I have recommended to friends and family.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased  with  the results I have gotten so far</li>
            <li> Need something larger is ok for on the go</li>
            <li> Battery quit holding a charge after 2 weeks.  Made zero difference on my skin. Time consuming to use.</li>
            <li> I have been using this machine for  half a year. I noticed that my wrinkles between the eyebrows and under the eyes are not noticeable any more, and the dark spots are lighter.   I used to have to use Frawnies facial patches between the eyebrows overnight to prevent the wrinkles from getting deeper and noticeable. But now I do not need to use the patches any more. The wrinkles there just don&#x27;t get deeper and are much lighter to be like expression lines. The two dark spots on my left cheek and crowfeet area are much lighter now (they have been there for more than 20 years due to sun exposure). The crowfeet wrinkles are not noticeable as before, either.   I will continue using this machine, two cycles every night after washing face (I use an ice cube to rub all over my face after washing face to let it dry out naturally. The cold temperature from the ice can close the pores.)  I am a vegan that makes a big difference in skin condition, and I take vitamin and mineral supplements (all my life). I discovered that the skin is really easy to take care of that is basically from what we eat. I believe the fat from an animal source tends to stay underneath the skin to cause all kinds of skin problems. Animal fat caused clogged pores that prevents water and oil from coming up to the surface naturally to moisturize the skin. Also because animal fat contains mainly saturated fat that is hard to be eliminated and tends to build up in the blood vessels to cause cardiovascular diseases later on in life.  When the body internal environment is full of toxins, they will come out through the skin as well. That&#x27;s why detox of the body is very important in skin care.  Since the skin is a reflection of health, eating a balanced diet with supplements (for most people, there is no guarantee that they can get all the vitamins and minerals from the food sources daily), drinking sufficient water, sleeping well, exercising (yoga is great), detoxing your body constantly, and cleaning your face thoroughly every day will absolutely make beautiful skin possible. Meditation is a way to cleanse the mind and spirit because it has to be a total health in every aspect to sustain your beauty.  These days, I do not use any skincare products at night after washing my face. Because when my pores are cleaned, water and oil can come up from underneath the skin to moisturize it naturally. I do eat a handful of nuts daily including two walnuts, one Brazil nut, as well as others, such as cashews, almonds, and so on, in addition to olive oil and avocado (variety is the key) We are what we eat. I have been observing my skin condition to adjust the food I eat without the need to put harmful chemicals on top of my skin that can clog the pores.  I noticed that when I stopped using it for two days, my gum ache was less and almost gone. I think perhaps the red light can make any inflammation worse.?   Ultimately, it&#x27;s your desire to want to look beautiful that works. When you have a strong desire to be young and beautiful, all sorts of information will become available to you to learn how. Because you can manifest what you really want in life. When you see others are beautiful, be happy for them, and want to look as beautiful as well that will help you reach your goal much sooner. When you get there, you&#x27;ll know what I mean. You really get what you give out. When you give out love and appreciation, you get the same in return from all sources. What matters is that you are the one spreading out the good energy first.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used it long enough for a review.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know yet as I just got it but I&#x27;m going to use it daily and persist. It is a convenient way of using 600mn LED light therapy as it is hand held. It is also  much much less expensive than those &amp;#34;medical&amp;#34; ones that are manufactured in  the same way at $400 to $600.</li>
