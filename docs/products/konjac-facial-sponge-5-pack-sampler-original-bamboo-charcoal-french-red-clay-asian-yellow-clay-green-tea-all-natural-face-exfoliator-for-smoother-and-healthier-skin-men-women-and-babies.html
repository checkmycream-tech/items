            <li>These are great gifts! !</li>
            <li>They are just PERFECT!  </li>
            <li>Great price for the sample pack.  </li>
            <li>They feel so good on my skin and cleanse beautifully.</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s good for the face I discovered.</li>
            <li>Love these sponges!  </li>
            <li>After using these for about two weeks my husband competed on how nice my skin was looking.</li>
            <li>Awesome variety pack to try out the different types and see what you like best or to give as gifts for the whole family to try them .</li>
            <li>/&gt;They do get very soft after soaking and feels very good on the skin  </li>
            <li>My husband not the most observant person</li>
            <li>I will be ordering more.</li>
            <li>I love the way they feel.</li>
            <li>I love this product too.  </li>
            <li>but my husband tends to be more oily.  </li>
            <li>Good value, lightening fast delivery.  </li>
            <li>Fast delivery and 100% satisfied!  </li>
            <li>I love these sponges they work great just wet and rub in circular motions.</li>
            <li>So labeling them with their unique properties would have been helpful in this order.</li>
            <li>These are slippery and didn&#x27;t leave my face feeling clean after using.</li>
            <li>I have used them with my facial cleanser and without and works well either way, just rinse it good when done to get the soap out.</li>
            <li>Great value for Konjac sponges for sponges I payed less for.  </li>
            <li>only used the white one so far, but it felt great and my face feels smooth, clean and healthy.</li>
            <li>These sponges feel good to use and I&#x27;m sure they will last a long time.</li>
            <li>Some say they feel slimy, but I have dry skin, so it actually feels good, and while some say it feels slimy</li>
            <li>so I know these really made a difference.</li>
            <li>I just wish that descriptions of each of the sponges properties were included in the package, or better yet, marked on each sponge&#x27;s individual wrapping</li>
            <li>nice collection, a small palm sized sponge</li>
            <li>as with any abasive for me I have to be careful around the drier more sensitive areas around my cheeks and outer nose</li>
            <li>Sanitary but not excessive packaging.  </li>
            <li>and wow what a difference in my skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soft but thorough at cleansing-</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if I have noticed a dramatic change in skin appearance, although my pores do look better overall.</li>

            <li> Love these sponges!  I ordered the 5 all different color and the price you can&#x27;t beat for all five! ! These are great gifts! ! You won&#x27;t be sorry ordering!  Fast delivery and 100% satisfied!  Thank you Beverly Hills Beauty and Amazon,  i will be ordering from you again!!!</li>
            <li> I am looking forward to using these to help with my skin problem.  I am also give a couple of them to my nephew who has started getting acne.</li>
            <li> Good value, lightening fast delivery.  Sanitary but not excessive packaging.  Everything was as described and expected.</li>
            <li> I wish I knew what each color was for. Konjac sponges are supposed to do different things for each color. Ex: Charcoal is to help get rid of acne. I think green is for dry skin? Etc. So labeling them with their unique properties would have been helpful in this order.</li>
            <li> I love these sponges they work great just wet and rub in circular motions. After using these for about two weeks my husband competed on how nice my skin was looking. My husband not the most observant person so I know these really made a difference. I would recommend these to my friends and family.</li>
            <li> I just got my sponges today and tried one&lt;br /&gt;They do get very soft after soaking and feels very good on the skin  I like them but they are bearly 3&amp;#34; in diameter and about 1&amp;#34; tall.  Not the 6.2x5.8 x2.6 &amp;#34;as they claim&lt;br /&gt;I was pretty disappointed about the size</li>
            <li> only used the white one so far, but it felt great and my face feels smooth, clean and healthy.</li>
            <li> Great price for the sample pack.  I use one every 2-3 days so each sponge has lasted about 2 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I agree with other posters that it would be helpful to have the properties of each of the different colors either in the listing or in the packaging to determine when to use each.</li>
            <li> I will use these forever!  They are just PERFECT!  They feel so good on my skin and cleanse beautifully.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed any specific results as far as the type of sponge goes, but I do have a little glow after scrubbing my face with one.</li>
            <li> I have been using these for about a week and wow what a difference in my skin. My nose and chin was cover with blackheads and after using this sponge I can see that they have slowly disappeared. I will be ordering more.</li>
            <li> Great value for Konjac sponges for sponges I payed less for.  At this price they are not.</li>
            <li> Awesome variety pack to try out the different types and see what you like best or to give as gifts for the whole family to try them .</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used all of them, just the black and the red. I love the way they feel. The come hard as rocks that&#x27;s why you have to soak them each time. Some say they feel slimy, but I have dry skin, so it actually feels good, and while some say it feels slimy it doesn&#x27;t leave your skin slimy. I have used them with my facial cleanser and without and works well either way, just rinse it good when done to get the soap out. I don&#x27;t know if I have noticed a dramatic change in skin appearance, although my pores do look better overall.</li>
            <li> Very small and a waste of money.</li>

            <li> I bought a pack for family as a stocking stuffer; I think it comes in 5 or 6 and everyone got at least one. Tho I believe it always depends on the persons skin, my husband loves it- so I decided to try it I love this product too.  It&#x27;s smaller than I thought they&#x27;d be but that&#x27;s good for the face I discovered. It&#x27;s soft but thorough at cleansing- as with any abasive for me I have to be careful around the drier more sensitive areas around my cheeks and outer nose but my husband tends to be more oily.  I&#x27;d like a bigger one for my outer thigh area!!!!</li>
            <li> These are slippery and didn&#x27;t leave my face feeling clean after using. Did not like at all.</li>
            <li> nice collection, a small palm sized sponge</li>
