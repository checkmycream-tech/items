            <li>products works better than the one i bought at Walmart for $4.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok , not my fav.</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>it makes me easily blend my concealer :)</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s AFFORDABLE and is very easy to clean.</li>
            <li>Very cute and mushy looks exactly like the picture</li>
            <li>This is easy to hold, and use.</li>
            <li>blends pretty well, pretty good for its price</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t very happy they were waaaay to small</li>
            <li>I find myself using my clean hands instead.</li>
            <li>Takes FOREVER to be delivered, but overall a good buy</li>
            <li>Not to face paint makeup, but are good to regular makeup.</li>
            <li>I just washed it with hand soap, and I left it outside for one hour or so, after this, the blender was clean and perfect again.</li>

            <li>I love these magic little blenders, everyday use for me, the application is non streaky and just beautiful.</li>
            <li>The only problem was that I was waiting for the item more than one month, but it was totally worthy.</li>
            <li>I was worried at first that this would suck up all my makeup and leave nothing to apply to my face.</li>
            <li>Such a cheaper alternative to the beauty blender, I love this sponge.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>came super early...</li>
            <li>It works really well</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t absorb as much water as I would like</li>
            <li>It soaks up too much of the liquid.  </li>
            <li>I really like this beauty blender.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really spongy which helps with foundation.</li>
            <li>This works really well with liquid foundation &amp; concealer.</li>
            <li>Fantastic, especially for the price.</li>
            <li>- Smaller then the original beauty sponges</li>
            <li>I need a new one!</li>
            <li>It is very soft to my skin, the color is like the one in the picture, and the size is very convenient for highlighting, countouring, etc.</li>
            <li>Very soft!</li>
            <li>so it is more stiff.</li>
            <li>so cheap because I will probably be throwing it away due to the horrendous smell.</li>
            <li>This wacky little contraption is ahh-mazing!</li>
            <li>This little thing is garbage compared to my rouge smooth blender</li>
            <li>I love this, although it&#x27;s a little smaller than one would think</li>
            <li>Definitely not a typical beauty blender, but it gets the job done!  </li>
            <li>Took a while to revive but that&#x27;s the only thing that I didn&#x27;t like other than that it&#x27;s worth it for the price and works better than any other beauty blender I&#x27;ve used from stores!</li>
            <li>For the price this little thing is defiantly worth it.</li>
            <li>Very stiff and doesn&#x27;t absorb water or expand like the original beauty blender.</li>

            <li> Very stiff and doesn&#x27;t absorb water or expand like the original beauty blender.</li>
            <li> It seems the sponge is a but harder to apply because it is a little more rough than a typical one; however, it works well when adding oil or lotion to the sponge before applying.  </li>
            <li> The brushes use to leave brush strokes, this weird foam thing seems to spread things soothe and a light application.</li>
            <li> It took a long periodically time to get here</li>
            <li> and I got the other ones for the same price</li>
            <li> When I bought it, it was only .89¢, so I guess the price went up a little hahah.</li>
            <li> UNUSABLE!!&lt;br /&gt;IT TOOK WEEKS TO DELIVER, NOT WORTH</li>
            <li> I mean they do work like the bigger ones I previously order</li>
            <li> The only issue is how small it is, but I use it for my contour and highlight everyday!</li>
            <li> use everyday.</li>
            <li> Dont waste your money on this.</li>
            <li> I usually use it couple of times per week, and I have washed it twice already, no problems at all.</li>
            <li> but these are too small</li>
            <li> Took 3 weeks and extremely small</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a small sponge, but it gets the job done.</li>
            <li> No more!</li>
            <li> The stuff is not good</li>
            <li> It takes like 3 weeks just for it to get here , wich sucks!</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s just me doing something wrong</li>
            <li> So I tested it and that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s dirty</li>
            <li> Terrible quality and hard as a rock</li>
            <li> TERRIBLE - HARD AND</li>
            <li> Its quality can be compared with no doubt to very expensive blenders.</li>
            <li> but VERY small and has a terrible odor that I can not seem to get rid of.</li>
            <li> I have always used the flimsy makeup sponges and hated them.</li>

            <li> Love love love love it!!!!</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIIIS . ugh the best way to set my makeup on my face thank you so much ♥ def, buying more at this price</li>
            <li> I LOVE it. It works really well, it&#x27;s AFFORDABLE and is very easy to clean. I will be purchasing this product again!</li>
            <li> I was worried at first that this would suck up all my makeup and leave nothing to apply to my face. I was happy to discover the squishy foam blender doesn&#x27;t suck up the makeup, and it actually spreads it around my face flawlessly. I like this more then the brushes I&#x27;ve been using. This is easy to hold, and use. The brushes use to leave brush strokes, this weird foam thing seems to spread things soothe and a light application. The texture of the foam is thicker then you might think. For the price this little thing is defiantly worth it.</li>
            <li> Got here early and works great!</li>
            <li> It took a long periodically time to get here but I love it 😀☺️</li>
            <li> When I bought it, it was only .89¢, so I guess the price went up a little hahah. But I LOVE IT! It&#x27;s so cute and work perfectly! Very soft!</li>
            <li> just what i needed.  it works great</li>
            <li> blends pretty well, pretty good for its price</li>
            <li> This was a great deal for the price, these are godd for applying base make up and washable also.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good and does the job. Not as well as the teardrop shaped beauty blender though. Doesn&#x27;t absorb as much water as I would like so it is more stiff.</li>
            <li> The stuff is not good but when I order the jewlery I love it</li>
            <li> It soaks up too much of the liquid.  I find myself using my clean hands instead.</li>
            <li> came super early... i love it!!</li>
            <li> Such a cheaper alternative to the beauty blender, I love this sponge. The only issue is how small it is, but I use it for my contour and highlight everyday! Life saver.</li>
            <li> Terrible quality and hard as a rock</li>
            <li> Amazing! Blends so well. Truly flawless</li>
            <li> I love this, although it&#x27;s a little smaller than one would think</li>
            <li> use everyday. love it</li>
            <li> TERRIBLE - HARD AND UNUSABLE!!&lt;br /&gt;IT TOOK WEEKS TO DELIVER, NOT WORTH MY DOLLAR!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ALSO DOES NOT SOAK WATER!</li>
            <li> Smoothes out the makeup wonderfully. Makeup is laid!</li>
            <li> I used this twice and gave it to my daughter for her play makeup, I didn&#x27;t like it at all! Maybe it&#x27;s just me doing something wrong (don&#x27;t think it would be that but ya never know) but it absorbs all the product!</li>
            <li> Great beauty blender!</li>
            <li> Dont waste your money on this. It takes like 3 weeks just for it to get here , wich sucks! And it doesnt blend as well.</li>
            <li> Took a while to get it but Im glad I got it!</li>
            <li> I really like this beauty blender. Its quality can be compared with no doubt to very expensive blenders. I usually use it couple of times per week, and I have washed it twice already, no problems at all. I just washed it with hand soap, and I left it outside for one hour or so, after this, the blender was clean and perfect again. It is very soft to my skin, the color is like the one in the picture, and the size is very convenient for highlighting, countouring, etc. I personallly use it for concealing and I love it. For this price, I would buy it again. The only problem was that I was waiting for the item more than one month, but it was totally worthy.</li>
            <li> products works better than the one i bought at Walmart for $4.</li>
            <li> Very stiff and doesn&#x27;t absorb water or expand like the original beauty blender. I know it&#x27;s only a dollar but dupes are meant to duplicate the product, no? Don&#x27;t buy this!</li>
            <li> Love using it ! Helps me apply my makeup easier</li>
            <li> This wacky little contraption is ahh-mazing! I have always used the flimsy makeup sponges and hated them. No more! I found my perfect tool.</li>
            <li> As described!  Thanks!</li>
            <li> This little thing is garbage compared to my rouge smooth blender</li>
            <li> So I tested it and that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s dirty but yeah, it works and I like it. ^~^</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t very happy they were waaaay to small I mean they do work like the bigger ones I previously order but these are too small and I got the other ones for the same price</li>
            <li> i received 3 and only one was not torn up..</li>
            <li> - Smaller then the original beauty sponges but it will still work and get the job done well...&lt;br /&gt;- Took forever to receive it...&lt;br /&gt;- I wish the sponge would have been packaged and then put in ANOTHER package to be mailed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;** When I do my reviews,I am 100% honest **</li>
            <li> I needed a magnifying glass to find it. Would not purchase again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really spongy which helps with foundation.</li>
            <li> I need a new one! I love these magic little blenders, everyday use for me, the application is non streaky and just beautiful.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving 3stars  because it came wrapped</li>
            <li> Took 3 weeks and extremely small</li>
            <li> it makes me easily blend my concealer :)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a small sponge, but it gets the job done.</li>
            <li> This works really well with liquid foundation &amp; concealer.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok , not my fav. I&#x27;ll just stick to my brushes.</li>
            <li> I love it.  It works amazingly</li>
            <li> Definitely not a typical beauty blender, but it gets the job done!  It seems the sponge is a but harder to apply because it is a little more rough than a typical one; however, it works well when adding oil or lotion to the sponge before applying.  Takes FOREVER to be delivered, but overall a good buy</li>
            <li> Took a while to revive but that&#x27;s the only thing that I didn&#x27;t like other than that it&#x27;s worth it for the price and works better than any other beauty blender I&#x27;ve used from stores! Would definitely recommend!! Doesn&#x27;t suck up much makeup at all!! Love it!</li>
            <li> Not to face paint makeup, but are good to regular makeup.</li>
            <li> Fantastic, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> It works technically...but VERY small and has a terrible odor that I can not seem to get rid of. Good thing it wasb so cheap because I will probably be throwing it away due to the horrendous smell. Shipping also took FOREVER but I did receive it on time.</li>
