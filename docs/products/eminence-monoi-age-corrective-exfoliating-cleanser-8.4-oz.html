    <ol>
            <li> fine exfoliating sand and smells subtle.&lt;br /&gt;I only with the pump worked. Never popped up so I have to life the entire pump and run finger along inside of bottle.</li>
            <li> This product provides the deep cleaning I need.  I enjoyed the starter kit, but have not replaced the other items as of yet.  Still debating on that issue.  Will buy this product again.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this face wash! I&#x27;ve been prone to getting breakouts along my chin and nose monthly and I have yet to have one since I started using this product two months ago. My skin seems a lot brighter and any roughness that I had before has gone away. I do sometimes dilute this with water because I use it daily, but even when I don&#x27;t the product doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin. I love how clear my skin is!</li>
            <li> Works great. I use it with a recharable facial brush.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  Muach better than myi old cleanser.  A very good organic cleanser.</li>
            <li> Like the smell, the way it feels on face and I will purchase this item again.</li>
            <li> Smell is awful.  No clue how well it works, couldn&#x27;t get past the smell</li>
            <li> I like this product, but there are other Eminence exfoliators I like better. I do like that it comes in a squirt pump. It&#x27;s a combo cleaners and exfoliator, which is nice. I prefer the fruit scented products, but this smells ok.</li>
            <li> The first cleaner that I actually like. Removes all traces of makeup.</li>
            <li> I love this exfoliating cleanser from Eminence.  I went to a local spa and they used this product line. Washes away any  impurities, removes debris gives you smooth skin.  The combination of gentle fruit AHAs, botanical enzymes and finely ground olive seeds refine and purify the skin&#x27;s texture for a more radiant and younger looking complexion.  Leaves my face soft.  Just need a little bit.  Apply to damp skin, and massage gently with fingertips then rinse throughly. For a lighter application dilute with a few drops of water before application.</li>
            <li> I just love this cleanser!  Cleans well and exfoliates too. My skin feels smooth and clean but not dry.</li>
            <li> Very gentle exfoliating cleanser.  Works well.</li>
            <li> This makes your skin feel so soft. I thought because it was an exfoliating, that it would be harsher and it is genital. It makes your skin soft and my skin has never looked better!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just starting to take care of my skin -- mid-30s and a little on the dry side.  The fragrance is herbal and clean, and a little goes a long way. The ground olive seed is the perfect exfoliant, as it&#x27;s not harsh and gritty. Loving the Neroli eye serum, the Arctic Berry peel system, and the Coconut age corrective moisturizer.  Fragrances and textures of the products are out of this world. First time the product arrived with a broken pump, but it was quickly replaced.  My skin has dramatically improved -- it&#x27;s a skincare regimen I look forward to!</li>
            <li> The ingredients in this product are really clean. It&#x27;s great for a mature face. Use it morning and night to keep your face clean.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this product!! Make your skin look plump and feel great!!! Would order again!!</li>
            <li> I love Eminence, this is no exception.  Exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> Excellent and I love this product and you will see a difference in your skin if used regularly.</li>
            <li> awesome product line...improves dry sensitive skin....so happy to be able to get here rather than spa!</li>
            <li> Smells great and works well in combination with my other anti-aging product.</li>
            <li> Seems to really exfoliate and moisturize.</li>
            <li> Good cleanser not excessively abrasive. Been using it morning and night. It cleanses without leaving a film on skin.Has a mild pleasant scent.</li>
            <li> Excellent product with immediate results!</li>
