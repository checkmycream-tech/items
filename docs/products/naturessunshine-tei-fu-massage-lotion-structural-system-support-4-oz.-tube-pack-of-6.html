    <ol>
            <li> I always buy Naturessunshine Tei Fu Massage lotion to reliev my back pain. It&#x27;s wonderful and I fell great using it.</li>
            <li> Teifu Oil helps with cuts &amp; scrapes, burns, insect bites and alleviating cold/flu symptoms when a sore/scratchy throat&lt;br /&gt;begins. It has many more uses.</li>
            <li> Very good if you have dystonia or severe muscle spasms.</li>
            <li> this stuff is the best</li>
            <li> I have significant chronic pain after several back surgeries. As a result of disc disease, I have nerve damage and I have significant musculoskeletal pain from back fusions at two levels. I have found Tei Fu to provide pain relief equal to moderate strength narcotics and it can relieve some nerve pain that narcotics doesn&#x27;t touch.</li>
            <li> This lotion work very good when you get pain</li>
            <li> I have been using Tei Fu lotion for years.  The best pain relief cream I have ever used.  It doesn&#x27;t burn as some do.  I have arthritis in my feet and I use this stuff daily.  I put it on before bed and I can fall asleep without pain keeping me awake.  I put it on in the morning and it helps me get going.  I love it for any type of muscle or joint pain.  The smell is menthol-ly, but I happen to like the smell; it&#x27;s comforting to me.  A lot of people I know like it too. But, if you&#x27;re looking for something without a medicinal odor, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li> this is the best stuff out there</li>
            <li> Have been using this product for about 10 years.  Really helps when I have back or neck pain or any muscle pain for that matter.  Just don&#x27;t get it near your eyes.  It will burn.  Love, love love it.</li>
            <li> I love this massage lotion and use it after working on patients.  The combination of the Chinese herb Tei Fu and wintergreen make for a powerful blend!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!! Will order again!!</li>
            <li> As a massage therapist I am always looking for great products to use on my clients.  I&#x27;ve used this product for a number of years!  I love it as well as my clients.  It helps to relax the muscles to a  deeper level. Feels great and leaves an invigorating feeling for hours later.</li>
            <li> it help my back pain and joints and I use it a lot  for all my discomfort knee and sometimes headache</li>
            <li> ITÂ´S A VERY GOOD PRODUCT</li>
            <li> Tei Fu works longer and better than any other topical muscle relaxant I have used.  My Aunt and Uncle (in their 80&#x27;s) would not dream of being without it.</li>
            <li> We have used Tei Fu for back and joint pain for over 15 years.  I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s in it but magic.  It not only make the pain feel better it makes it go away the next day.</li>
            <li> Great service and product. Thank you so much</li>
            <li> Have used this product for years and it is great.</li>
            <li> This is a great lotion for aches and pains. First discovered it when my massage therapist used the Tei Fu oil in the massaging lotions. The lotion is wonderful, and the price is pretty ok when you buy a few at a time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s called a massage lotion but I find it&#x27;s the best product around to rub in for sore muscles, sprains, etc. I play tennis and use it when I feel an ache or muscle pain.  Just make sure you wash/rub the residue off your applying hand as it stings if accidentally rubbed on the eye, etc.&lt;br /&gt;I was pleasantly surprised when this item arrived so quickly to my home in Hobart, Tasmania, Australia.  Great service.</li>
            <li> Several friends get together to order this product. It was my choice to order this time and I chose the ease and convenience of Amazon.</li>
