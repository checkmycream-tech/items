            <li>Honestly I was concerned as I bought the perfume without smelling it.</li>

            <li>It&#x27;d be nice if she came out with a cologne called &amp;#34;Monster&amp;#34; or something for the dudes.</li>
            <li>but i really liked this scent, to me</li>
            <li>I was apprehensive at first but was pleasantly surprized!</li>
            <li>I can honestly say that without a doubt I love this perfume.</li>
            <li>It was sort of overpowering, kind of strong.  </li>
            <li>but I LOVE this one.</li>
            <li>Better than what</li>
            <li>its make me feel like im a sexy girl</li>

            <li>realty  sexy</li>
            <li>I just got to thinking though, with this fragrance being so innovative</li>
            <li>The scent is really lovely without being overpowering.  </li>
            <li>so glad I didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;ll love this perfume.  </li>
            <li>Just wish it had more staying power.  </li>
            <li>It might work better for you.</li>
            <li>I love Gaga and am so in love with this fragrance.</li>
            <li>and I get so many compliments while wearing this.</li>
            <li>I LOVE Lady Gaga</li>
            <li>Love the smell and cant wait to buy it again</li>
            <li>LOVE GaGa</li>
            <li>and i love love love this product</li>
            <li>The bottle is interesting.</li>
            <li>I love the color of the liquid</li>
            <li>, it looks lovely on my shelf</li>
            <li>but I made sure to test the perfume in case I didn&#x27;t like it, before I bought it.</li>
            <li>and I tested it and fell in love with it.</li>
            <li>I feel sexy wearing it</li>
            <li>And I was able to order it here for almost $20 cheaper than I would&#x27;ve paid at a department store.</li>
            <li>Love this fragrance.  </li>
            <li>I love Gaga and the concept of the perfume.</li>
            <li>I have received so many compliments from men.</li>
            <li>I love the smell of this perfume.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I feel it is appropriate for work or night.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>The scent is just what you&#x27;d expect from Gaga--mysterious, extravagant, and intriguingly sexual.</li>
            <li>Lid is a bit quirky but the fragrance is is wonderful.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t need to be a Gaga fan (although I am) to love this.</li>
            <li>It shipped really fast, and was great quality for the price.</li>
            <li>This has become one of my favorite fragrances...</li>
            <li>Love the way I smell wearing this perfume.</li>
            <li>It seems to be a fusion of sweet, floral, fruity, powdery and warm (if that makes any sense).  </li>
            <li>The bottle looks really cool, kind of like the plasmids in BioShock.</li>
            <li>Its kind of sweet as well.</li>
            <li>It is quickly becoming my signature scent</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m very pleased to say that&#x27;s exactly what this is.</li>
            <li>they loved it so much</li>
            <li>she is a True ROCKSTAR &amp; Business Woman!</li>
            <li>I thought it was goi g to be unique and sexy..</li>
            <li>its not overly strong...</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t feel as strongly.  </li>
            <li>it is strong, flowery, and musky.</li>
            <li>Now the perfume itself smells cheap and strong, like a dollar store perfume.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s by Coty aNd has their stamp of a cheap strong smell.</li>
            <li>It starts off a little strong but it mellows out wonderfully after it dries.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a huge Lady Gaga fan</li>
            <li>This perfume is fabulous.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know those scents individually, but all of them combined made my senses do a happy dance.</li>
            <li>This is a fantastic scent for all of those lovers of \\&quot;heavy\\&quot; perfumes that aren&#x27;t too floral or \\&quot;spring rain/morning dew\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>I really Do Enjoy this Parfume.</li>
            <li>Absolutely wonderful even after a few hours.</li>
            <li>If it were a person I would describe it as quiet, sophisticated and charming.</li>
            <li>This has a very nice scent, though definitely a feminine one.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to have it, I tried it at a store and thought it was cheap at  Amazon.com.</li>
            <li>The smell is dark and sexy and perfect for an intimate night (I would imagine).</li>
            <li>i bought this for two people i love very much ..</li>
            <li>It mig be good for night wear like for a date or club, but way too strong for daily use.</li>
            <li>Worth the price!</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re a fan of perfumes like Burberry (the original) or Coco Chanel, Poemme, Narcisse, etc.</li>
            <li>I was not disappointed.</li>
            <li>definitely recommend this for a lady, it&#x27;s attractive and sensual, yet also very pretty too.</li>
            <li>As as Lady Gaga fan, I was excited when the fragrance came out.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so worth it!</li>
            <li>It is very very sexy, but still soft and feminine.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Leave it to Lady Gaga to give something so unique and sexy.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This package also arrived quickly and was packed securely.</li>
            <li>I love mature, sexy, clean scents</li>
            <li>I think I&#x27;d love it even if I wasn&#x27;t such a Lady Gaga fan, but it being her perfume makes it even more special!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;ll definitely be my \\&quot;special occasion\\&quot; scent.</li>
            <li>The price is definitely right!</li>
            <li>I am glad I bought it, and the store I bought it from the price was much cheaper then online.</li>
            <li>It kind of has an old lady hint to it that I did not smell in the sample.</li>
            <li>I wore it today and found that the scent lingers as a ghost-scent more than it really stays on the skin (this is how perfume is meant to be).</li>
            <li>Im sure you will be really intrigued by this perfume.</li>
            <li>Some people think it&#x27;s more of an adult scent, but I&#x27;m 17 and it&#x27;s just fine on me.</li>
            <li>This perfume has quickly become one of my favorites.</li>
            <li>&quot; so quick my head was spinning.</li>
            <li>* Shipping was Super Quick and packaging</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s sultry, sexy, and bound to become a classic.  </li>
            <li>I love Lady Gaga and this fragrance but still felt it was overrated only because the scent seems very familiar.</li>
            <li>At first I didn&#x27;t really like it, but after a week, I now love it.  </li>
            <li>its just very feminine and moderately strong.</li>
            <li>The greatest thing about this liquid is that black turns into clear.</li>
            <li>love the look, and smell of this product, and the fact that it is black liquid, is so unique and fancy, i love it.  </li>
            <li>and I am pleasantly surprised at how lovely the scent is..</li>
            <li>I was surprised that it did not smell like Courtney Love.</li>
            <li>And, it is the first black perfume ever made, so that alone is a great reason to buy it.</li>
            <li>Lady Gaga is known for her unique products, and this one is no different, with a spicy, exotic scent.</li>
            <li>From an aesthetic point it would have been better if the lid had been made with something other than plastic because it cheapens the bottle&#x27;s elegant</li>
            <li>and I want to bite someone&#x27;s ear right now.</li>
            <li>My 7 year old son also said I smelled good several times.</li>
            <li>WOW-super fast delivery!</li>
            <li>Fast shipping too!</li>
            <li>But, it&#x27;s not particularly expensive, so</li>
            <li>I really adore it!</li>
            <li>I fell in love the first time I smelled it and ended up going back to get it.</li>
            <li>Getting ready to reorder!</li>
            <li>so I tried one of these first:</li>
            <li>I love the smell of it, very unique packaging, the one and only color, like Gaga&#x27;s portrayal, should also buy back.</li>
            <li>If you are daring and love different perfumes and scents as much as I do go for it.  </li>
            <li>I bought this perfume based on the positive reviews.</li>
            <li>It smells sophisticated enough to wear to work yet light enough for a day out shopping.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a sexy, Fifty Shades of Grey, kinda scent.</li>
            <li>I know I certainly did.</li>
            <li>Everyone who has smelled it on me really likes it as well</li>
            <li>I was convinced it would be a quality knock off too (because of the price) but its totally real.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t see how it couldn&#x27;t be the real thing.</li>
            <li>Much like Gaga,this perfume is dark,and alluring.</li>
            <li>I wore it and then after just a minute it was gone, no matter how much I used.</li>
            <li>Do we really want our wives and daughters walking around with this perfume.</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;m very picky with my scents.</li>
            <li>Guys if your lady wants it then Id suggest buying it.</li>
            <li>After reading other comments, I have to agree, &amp;#34;you feel sexy while wearing it&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>Smells nice but doesn&#x27;t doesn&#x27;t seem to last as long as others.  </li>
            <li>The bottle is amazing as is the black liquid that sprays clear.</li>
            <li>Smells ok but what&#x27;s up with the black liquid ?</li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s black and the cap looks like a claw--it reminds me of the days when perfume bottles were art pieces.</li>
            <li>I love the bottle and the black liquid.</li>
            <li>I think this will be a perfume that turns into a classic.</li>
            <li>its got a good strength of smell, not to intents and not to weak.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a normal size to me.</li>
            <li>It comes on Strong ( as does GaGa ) but ends in a Subtle Sweet Manner.</li>
            <li>The artistic concept behind it is also appealing, but the fragrance itself is just one for the books.</li>
            <li>I said ok,and though I was a little nervous, not knowing what to expect, I was more than surprised.</li>
            <li>just buy this and tell everyone you are wearing Dame Edna&#x27;s new perfume</li>
            <li>Long lasting and not overly strong.</li>
            <li>If you are picky, don&#x27;t have a wide appreciation of scents and don&#x27;t like a sweet note, avoid it.</li>
            <li>Smells great, neat package, a little expensive but worth it.</li>
            <li>and I think the unique bottle design and the fact that is looks black in the bottle but goes on clear is a testament to Lady Gaga&#x27;s uniqueness.</li>
            <li>This one is soft and not overly alcohol smelling or feeling.</li>
            <li>I would almost imagine that this is what sexy \\&quot;fashionista\\&quot; women in 1920&#x27;s Paris, France would of smelled like, or at least that what it harkens me too.</li>
            <li>The scent is flowery but mature.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a 20 year old guy</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t stray too far from Marc Jacobs Daisy or Lola.</li>
            <li>Just open it slowly because it&#x27;s kind of spiky.</li>
            <li>It arrived quickly and came with some cool fragrance samples and coupons, but the &amp;#34;Fame&amp;#34; perfume smells a little generic and doesn&#x27;t seem to last.</li>
            <li>I only used a tiny drop of what I bought because it will only be for special occasions.</li>
            <li>I thought It was clever to get it for a lesser price.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soft and fades a little too fast, but I don&#x27;t mind reapplying, especially because I like it so much.  </li>
            <li>I myself have always had a major crush on Gaga, and my mom is a fan as well.</li>
            <li>A small squirt smells strong enough to me.</li>
            <li>was a little worried about other reviews saying that its VERY unique</li>
            <li>First black perfume.</li>
            <li>At first, in my opinion, the scent was not unique.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> but I made sure to test the perfume in case I didn&#x27;t like it, before I bought it.</li>
            <li> and I tested it and fell in love with it.</li>
            <li> I feel sexy wearing it</li>
            <li> And I was able to order it here for almost $20 cheaper than I would&#x27;ve paid at a department store.</li>
            <li> Love this fragrance.  </li>
            <li> I love Gaga and the concept of the perfume.</li>
            <li> I have received so many compliments from men.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this perfume.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I feel it is appropriate for work or night.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> The scent is just what you&#x27;d expect from Gaga--mysterious, extravagant, and intriguingly sexual.</li>
            <li> Lid is a bit quirky but the fragrance is is wonderful.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t need to be a Gaga fan (although I am) to love this.</li>
            <li> It shipped really fast, and was great quality for the price.</li>
            <li> This has become one of my favorite fragrances...</li>
            <li> Love the way I smell wearing this perfume.</li>
            <li> It seems to be a fusion of sweet, floral, fruity, powdery and warm (if that makes any sense).  </li>
            <li> The bottle looks really cool, kind of like the plasmids in BioShock.</li>
            <li> Its kind of sweet as well.</li>
            <li> It is quickly becoming my signature scent</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m very pleased to say that&#x27;s exactly what this is.</li>
            <li> they loved it so much</li>
            <li> she is a True ROCKSTAR &amp; Business Woman!</li>
            <li> I thought it was goi g to be unique and sexy..</li>
            <li> its not overly strong...</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel as strongly.  </li>
            <li> it is strong, flowery, and musky.</li>
            <li> Now the perfume itself smells cheap and strong, like a dollar store perfume.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s by Coty aNd has their stamp of a cheap strong smell.</li>
            <li> It starts off a little strong but it mellows out wonderfully after it dries.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a huge Lady Gaga fan</li>
            <li> This perfume is fabulous.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know those scents individually, but all of them combined made my senses do a happy dance.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic scent for all of those lovers of \\&quot;heavy\\&quot; perfumes that aren&#x27;t too floral or \\&quot;spring rain/morning dew\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> I really Do Enjoy this Parfume.</li>
            <li> Absolutely wonderful even after a few hours.</li>
            <li> If it were a person I would describe it as quiet, sophisticated and charming.</li>
            <li> This has a very nice scent, though definitely a feminine one.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to have it, I tried it at a store and thought it was cheap at  Amazon.com.</li>
            <li> The smell is dark and sexy and perfect for an intimate night (I would imagine).</li>
            <li> i bought this for two people i love very much ..</li>
            <li> It mig be good for night wear like for a date or club, but way too strong for daily use.</li>
            <li> Worth the price!</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re a fan of perfumes like Burberry (the original) or Coco Chanel, Poemme, Narcisse, etc.</li>
            <li> I was not disappointed.</li>
            <li> definitely recommend this for a lady, it&#x27;s attractive and sensual, yet also very pretty too.</li>
            <li> As as Lady Gaga fan, I was excited when the fragrance came out.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so worth it!</li>
            <li> It is very very sexy, but still soft and feminine.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Leave it to Lady Gaga to give something so unique and sexy.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This package also arrived quickly and was packed securely.</li>
            <li> I love mature, sexy, clean scents</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;d love it even if I wasn&#x27;t such a Lady Gaga fan, but it being her perfume makes it even more special!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;ll definitely be my \\&quot;special occasion\\&quot; scent.</li>
            <li> The price is definitely right!</li>
            <li> I am glad I bought it, and the store I bought it from the price was much cheaper then online.</li>
            <li> It kind of has an old lady hint to it that I did not smell in the sample.</li>
            <li> I wore it today and found that the scent lingers as a ghost-scent more than it really stays on the skin (this is how perfume is meant to be).</li>
            <li> Im sure you will be really intrigued by this perfume.</li>
            <li> Some people think it&#x27;s more of an adult scent, but I&#x27;m 17 and it&#x27;s just fine on me.</li>
            <li> This perfume has quickly become one of my favorites.</li>
            <li> &quot; so quick my head was spinning.</li>
            <li> * Shipping was Super Quick and packaging</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s sultry, sexy, and bound to become a classic.  </li>
            <li> I love Lady Gaga and this fragrance but still felt it was overrated only because the scent seems very familiar.</li>
            <li> At first I didn&#x27;t really like it, but after a week, I now love it.  </li>
            <li> its just very feminine and moderately strong.</li>
            <li> The greatest thing about this liquid is that black turns into clear.</li>
            <li> love the look, and smell of this product, and the fact that it is black liquid, is so unique and fancy, i love it.  </li>
            <li> and I am pleasantly surprised at how lovely the scent is..</li>
            <li> I was surprised that it did not smell like Courtney Love.</li>
            <li> And, it is the first black perfume ever made, so that alone is a great reason to buy it.</li>
            <li> Lady Gaga is known for her unique products, and this one is no different, with a spicy, exotic scent.</li>
            <li> From an aesthetic point it would have been better if the lid had been made with something other than plastic because it cheapens the bottle&#x27;s elegant</li>
            <li> and I want to bite someone&#x27;s ear right now.</li>
            <li> My 7 year old son also said I smelled good several times.</li>
            <li> WOW-super fast delivery!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping too!</li>
            <li> But, it&#x27;s not particularly expensive, so</li>
            <li> I really adore it!</li>
            <li> I fell in love the first time I smelled it and ended up going back to get it.</li>
            <li> Getting ready to reorder!</li>
            <li> so I tried one of these first:</li>
            <li> I love the smell of it, very unique packaging, the one and only color, like Gaga&#x27;s portrayal, should also buy back.</li>
            <li> If you are daring and love different perfumes and scents as much as I do go for it.  </li>
            <li> I bought this perfume based on the positive reviews.</li>
            <li> It smells sophisticated enough to wear to work yet light enough for a day out shopping.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a sexy, Fifty Shades of Grey, kinda scent.</li>
            <li> I know I certainly did.</li>
            <li> Everyone who has smelled it on me really likes it as well</li>
            <li> I was convinced it would be a quality knock off too (because of the price) but its totally real.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see how it couldn&#x27;t be the real thing.</li>
            <li> Much like Gaga,this perfume is dark,and alluring.</li>
            <li> I wore it and then after just a minute it was gone, no matter how much I used.</li>
            <li> Do we really want our wives and daughters walking around with this perfume.</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;m very picky with my scents.</li>
            <li> Guys if your lady wants it then Id suggest buying it.</li>
            <li> After reading other comments, I have to agree, &amp;#34;you feel sexy while wearing it&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> Smells nice but doesn&#x27;t doesn&#x27;t seem to last as long as others.  </li>
            <li> The bottle is amazing as is the black liquid that sprays clear.</li>
            <li> Smells ok but what&#x27;s up with the black liquid ?</li>
            <li> I love that it&#x27;s black and the cap looks like a claw--it reminds me of the days when perfume bottles were art pieces.</li>
            <li> I love the bottle and the black liquid.</li>
            <li> I think this will be a perfume that turns into a classic.</li>
            <li> its got a good strength of smell, not to intents and not to weak.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a normal size to me.</li>
            <li> It comes on Strong ( as does GaGa ) but ends in a Subtle Sweet Manner.</li>
            <li> The artistic concept behind it is also appealing, but the fragrance itself is just one for the books.</li>
            <li> I said ok,and though I was a little nervous, not knowing what to expect, I was more than surprised.</li>
            <li> just buy this and tell everyone you are wearing Dame Edna&#x27;s new perfume</li>
            <li> Long lasting and not overly strong.</li>
            <li> If you are picky, don&#x27;t have a wide appreciation of scents and don&#x27;t like a sweet note, avoid it.</li>
            <li> Smells great, neat package, a little expensive but worth it.</li>
            <li> and I think the unique bottle design and the fact that is looks black in the bottle but goes on clear is a testament to Lady Gaga&#x27;s uniqueness.</li>
            <li> This one is soft and not overly alcohol smelling or feeling.</li>
            <li> I would almost imagine that this is what sexy \\&quot;fashionista\\&quot; women in 1920&#x27;s Paris, France would of smelled like, or at least that what it harkens me too.</li>
            <li> The scent is flowery but mature.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 20 year old guy</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t stray too far from Marc Jacobs Daisy or Lola.</li>
            <li> Just open it slowly because it&#x27;s kind of spiky.</li>
            <li> It arrived quickly and came with some cool fragrance samples and coupons, but the &amp;#34;Fame&amp;#34; perfume smells a little generic and doesn&#x27;t seem to last.</li>
            <li> I only used a tiny drop of what I bought because it will only be for special occasions.</li>
            <li> I thought It was clever to get it for a lesser price.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soft and fades a little too fast, but I don&#x27;t mind reapplying, especially because I like it so much.  </li>
            <li> I myself have always had a major crush on Gaga, and my mom is a fan as well.</li>
            <li> A small squirt smells strong enough to me.</li>
            <li> was a little worried about other reviews saying that its VERY unique</li>
            <li> First black perfume.</li>
            <li> At first, in my opinion, the scent was not unique.  </li>
            <li> I expected a tiny bottle because it was the smaller of the two.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;d buy this particular scent.</li>
            <li> When it comes to fragrances I&#x27;m a little old school.</li>
            <li> It lasts as long as a body mist would.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> but yeah, I&#x27;d definitely recommend this if you wear perfume a lot, and just a little goes a long way, so it will last you!</li>
            <li> Its so different from any other perfume</li>
            <li> I usually wear natural oils and my skin is sensitive-my sinuses too.</li>
            <li> I typically stay around the Chanel fragrances (the indomitable sexy/musky fragrances) to Marc Jacobs.</li>
            <li> I was afraid it was going to be too strong but</li>
            <li> Lady GaGa fan, but not of this cologne.&lt;br /&gt;Too sweat for me, &amp; it did stain my shirt so be careful if you try it.</li>
            <li> I think my sniffer went numb for a minute because I did not know whether to be excited or walk away.</li>
            <li> Soft and subtle are two words I wouldnt use to describe Lady Gaga</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way for me!</li>
            <li> I especially like to be a little Marilyn Monroe about it, and put on a little before settling to bed, going to bed with a hint of this perfume</li>
            <li> The cap was the biggest challenge for me; though it is artistic and aesthetically pleasing, I had difficulty removing it and was afraid of being impaled on the spikes when closing the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Hate that, most the the cologne</li>
            <li> For about 8 dollars less I got this one.</li>
            <li> I was worried when I was it was black...</li>
            <li> It had a rather odd display and tester, but I tested it anyway.</li>
            <li> and no, the black color does not color your skin.</li>
            <li> This perfume is not a sweet, girly scent, if that is what you are looking for.  </li>
            <li> I just wish it lasted a little longer - it seems to wear off within a couple of hours.</li>
            <li> but everyone I asked also disliked it.</li>
            <li> I used it everyday</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s not a cloying or heavy scent.</li>
            <li> Definitely a scent for the ladies, I think it would be a little questionable on men.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s plastic and sharply pointed, making it awkward to open.</li>
            <li> Smells the same but disappointed because the fragrance doesn&#x27;t last!</li>
            <li> I was not sure what to expect when this fragrance was announced.</li>
            <li> not sure what to say  </li>
            <li> Sorry I bought the big one as I won&#x27;t use it often.</li>
            <li> This is feminine with a little subtle edge.</li>
            <li> It will take me at least a year to use all.</li>
            <li> Boring, cheap, headache-inducing scent that is irritating.</li>
            <li> Really weird that its black</li>
            <li> Either this is fake, or lady gaga help create the worst perfume, it literally stays on your body for 5 minutes, doesent matter how much perfume you spray on yourself, I&#x27;ve gone thrue half a bottle in a week, this is the worst perfume in history, cheap baby perfume lasts longer than this</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really hard to explain it though, which is frustrating for those wanting to read about it.  </li>
            <li> After spraying it, I looked at the woman behind the counter and said \\&quot;I&#x27;ll take it\\</li>
            <li> This broad is the worst, but this item smells like a dream.  </li>
            <li> I tried the tester at Macy&#x27;s around 2:00pm yesterday and at 6:30, even after a shower around 3:00, I could still smell a faint trace on my wrist.</li>
            <li> Creepy!</li>
            <li> I hate powdery perfumes, a lot...</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I bought this perfume based on the positive reviews. Honestly I was concerned as I bought the perfume without smelling it. When it arrived I opened my package, sprayed it...and I am pleasantly surprised at how lovely the scent is..I was afraid it was going to be too strong but thankfully its not. A little goes a long way for me! I absolutely love it! This package also arrived quickly and was packed securely. I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I &amp;#60;3&amp;#60;3&amp;#60;3&amp;#60;3&amp;#60;3 it My kid always trys to steal it from me....Everyone who has smelled it on me really likes it as well</li>
            <li> WOW-super fast delivery! Not even 36 hours has passed and it arrived! I don&#x27;t wear Parfum but I LOVE this one. I expected a tiny bottle because it was the smaller of the two. For about 8 dollars less I got this one. I was convinced it would be a quality knock off too (because of the price) but its totally real.The box was wrapped in plastic film. Came unopened in bubble wrap in a solid box. I don&#x27;t see how it couldn&#x27;t be the real thing. No itchy skin yet either!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a normal size to me. It will take me at least a year to use all. A small squirt smells strong enough to me. I usually wear natural oils and my skin is sensitive-my sinuses too. This one is soft and not overly alcohol smelling or feeling. So it&#x27;s not abrasive. Lingers well and still smells amazing. I&#x27;m not your floral scent wearer. This is feminine with a little subtle edge. If it were a person I would describe it as quiet, sophisticated and charming.</li>
            <li> Does not stay w/you all day, but it&#x27;s a nice smelling perfume.</li>
            <li> Boring, cheap, headache-inducing scent that is irritating. Smells like the detergent I use regularly. I thought it was just a matter of taste but everyone I asked also disliked it. threw it away.</li>
            <li> This broad is the worst, but this item smells like a dream.  just buy this and tell everyone you are wearing Dame Edna&#x27;s new perfume and everyone is a winner!</li>
            <li> Much like Gaga,this perfume is dark,and alluring.</li>
            <li> First black perfume. I&#x27;m wondering how would her face look like after she receives this gift. Looking forward to the result.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to have it, I tried it at a store and thought it was cheap at  Amazon.com. I thought It was clever to get it for a lesser price. Indeed  it was cheaper, however, wasn&#x27;t lasting. I wore it and then after just a minute it was gone, no matter how much I used. Unlike the one I tried at stores, that one lasts for days. SO UNWORTH it.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my sister for Christmas and she loved it. Fast shipping too!</li>
            <li> This perfume is fabulous. Its smell so good!! Better than what im expect. I used it everyday its make me feel like im a sexy girl</li>
            <li> Either this is fake, or lady gaga help create the worst perfume, it literally stays on your body for 5 minutes, doesent matter how much perfume you spray on yourself, I&#x27;ve gone thrue half a bottle in a week, this is the worst perfume in history, cheap baby perfume lasts longer than this</li>
            <li> Smelled this fragrance at Macy&#x27;s but as usual they want your first born for it so I ordered it from Amazon for a much better price. Smells the same but disappointed because the fragrance doesn&#x27;t last! After an hour it&#x27;s as if you have nothing on. Hate that, most the the cologne I purchase I can catch whiffs of it all day or I am asked what is it I&#x27;m wearing but not with this. Will not purchase it again.</li>
            <li> This perfume has quickly become one of my favorites. It smells sophisticated enough to wear to work yet light enough for a day out shopping. Lady Gaga is known for her unique products, and this one is no different, with a spicy, exotic scent. I will be eagerly watching to see if she makes another perfume.</li>
            <li> Why would anyone one put blood and semen inside a perfume bottle? Do we really want our wives and daughters walking around with this perfume. Looked up the ingredients. Creepy!</li>
            <li> I personally love this scent.  It&#x27;s really hard to explain it though, which is frustrating for those wanting to read about it.  I hate powdery perfumes, a lot... that being said I think a lot of people would say this has a powdery background.  It&#x27;s not baby powder though, it&#x27;s nice.  It&#x27;s soft and fades a little too fast, but I don&#x27;t mind reapplying, especially because I like it so much.  It also has a sort of fruity/flowery smell on top... I guess.  If you are daring and love different perfumes and scents as much as I do go for it.  If you are picky, don&#x27;t have a wide appreciation of scents and don&#x27;t like a sweet note, avoid it.</li>
            <li> Love this perfume.... smell stays with you all day ... its not overly strong...I was worried when I was it was black...but NO WORRY!!!....It smells realty  sexy</li>
            <li> I was not sure what to expect when this fragrance was announced. I thought it was being released in September but it was the end of August. I went to Carson&#x27;s department store tonight and I saw the display. It had a rather odd display and tester, but I tested it anyway. I think my sniffer went numb for a minute because I did not know whether to be excited or walk away. I was surprised that it did not smell like Courtney Love. After spraying it, I looked at the woman behind the counter and said \\&quot;I&#x27;ll take it\\&quot; so quick my head was spinning. The bottle is gorgeous, and the scent is very gorgeous, and it is layered too. I only used a tiny drop of what I bought because it will only be for special occasions. I am glad I bought it, and the store I bought it from the price was much cheaper then online. I think it is wonderful. I just got to thinking though, with this fragrance being so innovative, what do you think her 3rd fragrance will look and smell like? B+</li>
            <li> I was walking through Dillard&#x27;s department store,  and one of the ladies asked if I would like to try Fame by Lady Gaga. I said ok,and though I was a little nervous, not knowing what to expect, I was more than surprised. It smells really, really good and it lasted through the rest of the day. I could detect the apricot and honey notes in it, and it says it has Belladonna and Incense as well as Jasmine Sambac &amp; Tiger Orchidea. I don&#x27;t know those scents individually, but all of them combined made my senses do a happy dance. My 7 year old son also said I smelled good several times. Worth the price! You will love it! I know I certainly did.</li>
            <li> I went to Macy&#x27;s today with every intention of buying another brand, but tried this and was hooked. The scent is really lovely without being overpowering.  It seems to be a fusion of sweet, floral, fruity, powdery and warm (if that makes any sense).  When I saw the Lady Gaga display I almost dismissed it without a second thought, so glad I didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> not sure what to say  she likes it alot and wears it do be do be do be do be</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t let the cap scare you. this fragrance is very beautiful. Works for me.  and no, the black color does not color your skin.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife as part of a birthday gift because she had mentioned that she wanted to try it, and also is a fan of the Lady Gaga.</li>
            <li> I smelled this in a magazine and had to have it.  After getting it and using it I don&#x27;t feel as strongly.  It kind of has an old lady hint to it that I did not smell in the sample.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic scent for all of those lovers of \\&quot;heavy\\&quot; perfumes that aren&#x27;t too floral or \\&quot;spring rain/morning dew\\&quot;.  On the contrary, it&#x27;s spicy, sweet and perfect for the fall and winter.  If you&#x27;re a fan of perfumes like Burberry (the original) or Coco Chanel, Poemme, Narcisse, etc. you&#x27;ll love this perfume.  One drawback, however, is that after about an hour I can&#x27;t smell it on myself anymore.  So, I feel like it&#x27;s lacking in staying power.  But, it&#x27;s not particularly expensive, so maybe you get what you pay for?</li>
            <li> It might be me but the smell didn&#x27;t stay with me at all.  I sprayed it on and couldn&#x27;t smell it.  I liked it on the sample board. Just wish it had more staying power.  It might work better for you.</li>
            <li> I love Gaga and am so in love with this fragrance. Im about to order another bottle. The frangrance last all day and I get so many compliments while wearing this. This is a must have!!!!!</li>
            <li> I LOVE Lady Gaga so I had to get her perfume.  At first I didn&#x27;t really like it, but after a week, I now love it.  At first, in my opinion, the scent was not unique.  It was sort of overpowering, kind of strong.  This perfume is not a sweet, girly scent, if that is what you are looking for.  After reading other comments, I have to agree, &amp;#34;you feel sexy while wearing it&amp;#34;.  And, it is the first black perfume ever made, so that alone is a great reason to buy it.</li>
            <li> i bought this for two people i love very much ..my daughter and my best freind..they loved it so much</li>
            <li> Great item, Great Seller</li>
            <li> Love the smell and cant wait to buy it again</li>
            <li> I really Do Enjoy this Parfume. It comes on Strong ( as does GaGa ) but ends in a Subtle Sweet Manner. I was apprehensive at first but was pleasantly surprized! LOVE GaGa she is a True ROCKSTAR &amp; Business Woman! BTW * Shipping was Super Quick and packaging Great would Buy from this seller again!!</li>
            <li> Even if you&#x27;re not a fan of Gaga I would suggest you definitely try out this fragrance. I really adore it! I just recently got it as a gift and I&#x27;ve worn it every day since. It is quickly becoming my signature scent, it&#x27;s sultry, sexy, and bound to become a classic.  The artistic concept behind it is also appealing, but the fragrance itself is just one for the books. I would almost imagine that this is what sexy \\&quot;fashionista\\&quot; women in 1920&#x27;s Paris, France would of smelled like, or at least that what it harkens me too. I especially like to be a little Marilyn Monroe about it, and put on a little before settling to bed, going to bed with a hint of this perfume is really nice.</li>
            <li> bought for a friend smells really good will be buying one for myself</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t know what to expect since i didn&#x27;t know what the fragrance smelled like before i bought it. i have to say i am very pleased and i love love love this product</li>
            <li> I love the smell of it, very unique packaging, the one and only color, like Gaga&#x27;s portrayal, should also buy back.</li>
            <li> This Lady Gaga perfume smells very nice. The bottle is interesting. If you are a Lady Gaga fan you would want this for your collection.</li>
            <li> excelente producto, muy bueno, me encanta este perfume, se los recomiendo a todos, el envió fue rápido,  sencillo para la compra</li>
            <li> Great price for this lovely scent</li>
            <li> Good stuff! The scent is flowery but mature. I just wish it lasted a little longer - it seems to wear off within a couple of hours. The price is definitely right!</li>
            <li> It arrived quickly and came with some cool fragrance samples and coupons, but the &amp;#34;Fame&amp;#34; perfume smells a little generic and doesn&#x27;t seem to last. It lasts as long as a body mist would.&lt;br /&gt; I love the color of the liquid, it looks lovely on my shelf but I thought the lid would be metal or something from the picture - it&#x27;s plastic and sharply pointed, making it awkward to open. From an aesthetic point it would have been better if the lid had been made with something other than plastic because it cheapens the bottle&#x27;s elegant design.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d buy from this seller again but I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;d buy this particular scent.</li>
            <li> I love this scent! I&#x27;m a huge Lady Gaga fan but I made sure to test the perfume in case I didn&#x27;t like it, before I bought it. I was not disappointed. Some people think it&#x27;s more of an adult scent, but I&#x27;m 17 and it&#x27;s just fine on me. Definitely a scent for the ladies, I think it would be a little questionable on men. The smell is dark and sexy and perfect for an intimate night (I would imagine). I noticed that the perfume does leave a blotch on white clothing despite turning invisible when sprayed. But perfume is meant for skin not clothes, so that is a non-issue. The cap was the biggest challenge for me; though it is artistic and aesthetically pleasing, I had difficulty removing it and was afraid of being impaled on the spikes when closing the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;I also noticed some people complaining that the scent doesn&#x27;t last. I tried the tester at Macy&#x27;s around 2:00pm yesterday and at 6:30, even after a shower around 3:00, I could still smell a faint trace on my wrist. I wore it today and found that the scent lingers as a ghost-scent more than it really stays on the skin (this is how perfume is meant to be). It starts off a little strong but it mellows out wonderfully after it dries.&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend this for a lady, it&#x27;s attractive and sensual, yet also very pretty too. And it&#x27;s not a cloying or heavy scent. Very nice, though probably too sexy for anyone under the age of sixteen.</li>
            <li> When it comes to fragrances I&#x27;m a little old school. I don&#x27;t like anything fruity or flowery. I typically stay around the Chanel fragrances (the indomitable sexy/musky fragrances) to Marc Jacobs. I can honestly say that without a doubt I love this perfume. A friend of mine had a sample and I tested it and fell in love with it. It is not overpowering and I think the unique bottle design and the fact that is looks black in the bottle but goes on clear is a testament to Lady Gaga&#x27;s uniqueness. Absolutely wonderful even after a few hours. I feel sexy wearing it and I want to bite someone&#x27;s ear right now. Of course I&#x27;m also reviewing haunted houses so that might be the reason. I&#x27;ve gotten compliments just from the sample. It&#x27;s a sexy, Fifty Shades of Grey, kinda scent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 20 year old guy and I decided to buy this fragrance for my mother for Christmas. I myself have always had a major crush on Gaga, and my mom is a fan as well. This has a very nice scent, though definitely a feminine one. It&#x27;d be nice if she came out with a cologne called &amp;#34;Monster&amp;#34; or something for the dudes. Lol but yeah, I&#x27;d definitely recommend this if you wear perfume a lot, and just a little goes a long way, so it will last you! The bottle looks really cool, kind of like the plasmids in BioShock. Just open it slowly because it&#x27;s kind of spiky.</li>
            <li> As as Lady Gaga fan, I was excited when the fragrance came out. But I&#x27;m very picky with my scents. I don&#x27;t stray too far from Marc Jacobs Daisy or Lola. I love mature, sexy, clean scents so I&#x27;m very pleased to say that&#x27;s exactly what this is. It&#x27;ll definitely be my \\&quot;special occasion\\&quot; scent. It smells so sexy and expensive. It&#x27;s so worth it! And I was able to order it here for almost $20 cheaper than I would&#x27;ve paid at a department store. And I just LOVE how the bottle looks on my vanity!</li>
            <li> Love this fragrance.  Would recommend.</li>
            <li> Lady GaGa fan, but not of this cologne.&lt;br /&gt;Too sweat for me, &amp; it did stain my shirt so be careful if you try it.</li>
            <li> To me It just doesn&#x27;t smell the same as the one in the department store...</li>
            <li> I love Lady Gaga and this fragrance but still felt it was overrated only because the scent seems very familiar. The greatest thing about this liquid is that black turns into clear. Really good fragrance but not a wowser.</li>
            <li> I love Gaga and the concept of the perfume. The bottle is amazing as is the black liquid that sprays clear. Now the perfume itself smells cheap and strong, like a dollar store perfume. It mig be good for night wear like for a date or club, but way too strong for daily use. I thought it was goi g to be unique and sexy..it is strong, flowery, and musky. It&#x27;s by Coty aNd has their stamp of a cheap strong smell. Sorry I bought the big one as I won&#x27;t use it often.</li>
            <li> Most scents make me sneeze and this one didn&#x27;t! I fell in love the first time I smelled it and ended up going back to get it. I have received so many compliments from men. This is a keeper! Getting ready to reorder!</li>
            <li> i got this for my girlfriend for christmas and she loves it and its got a good strength of smell, not to intents and not to weak.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this perfume. Its so different from any other perfume Ive ever smelled. It is very very sexy, but still soft and feminine. Its kind of sweet as well. I love it. The word that comes to mind is electrifying. I started wearing it to work about a week ago, and I have gotten a lot of compliments from women and men. I feel it is appropriate for work or night.&lt;br /&gt;Leave it to Lady Gaga to give something so unique and sexy.&lt;br /&gt;I was a little worried about other reviews saying that its VERY unique so I tried one of these first: [[ASIN:B00B218HC4 Lady Gaga Fame Perfume Oil: Lady Gaga Perfume Women type .5 Ounce Roll-on Perfume]] and was hooked, my hubby too. Im sure you will be really intrigued by this perfume. I absolutely love it. Love!</li>
            <li> Smells ok but what&#x27;s up with the black liquid ?</li>
            <li> The scent is just what you&#x27;d expect from Gaga--mysterious, extravagant, and intriguingly sexual. I love that it&#x27;s black and the cap looks like a claw--it reminds me of the days when perfume bottles were art pieces.</li>
            <li> Lid is a bit quirky but the fragrance is is wonderful. Long lasting and not overly strong. Don&#x27;t need to be a Gaga fan (although I am) to love this.</li>
            <li> Soft and subtle are two words I wouldnt use to describe Lady Gaga but they are 2 words I&#x27;d use to describe the perfume. Really weird that its black but it doesnt seem to stain any clothing. Guys if your lady wants it then Id suggest buying it. 2 thumbs up!</li>
            <li> love the look, and smell of this product, and the fact that it is black liquid, is so unique and fancy, i love it.  It shipped really fast, and was great quality for the price.</li>
            <li> This has become one of my favorite fragrances... Luv the bottle &amp; design. This is a wonderful smelling perfume.  Would definitely recommend this product! !!</li>
            <li> Love the way I smell wearing this perfume. I think I&#x27;d love it even if I wasn&#x27;t such a Lady Gaga fan, but it being her perfume makes it even more special!</li>
            <li> loved it very satisfied.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a fan of Gaga but i really liked this scent, to me its just very feminine and moderately strong. Very sexy, something you wear at night. I love the bottle and the black liquid. I think this will be a perfume that turns into a classic.</li>
            <li> Smells nice but doesn&#x27;t doesn&#x27;t seem to last as long as others.  I don&#x27;t think I would buy this fragrance again.</li>
            <li> My wife loved the perfume and so did I, although I did not wear it. Smells great, neat package, a little expensive but worth it.</li>
