            <li>I got to try this product free for review super high quality product, loved it and felt and saw results after one use!</li>
            <li>This is a very nice clay mask, and I found it very effective at reducing the number of small breakouts I get around my T-zone area.</li>
            <li>I love the fresh smell of it and it has that tingling sensation but it is not too strong like most masks can be.</li>
            <li>face mask applies easily - I just use my fingers to spread it around, keeping away from my eyes-mouth-nose openings.</li>
            <li>masque didn&#x27;t have a strong scent</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is paraben free so you don&#x27;t have to worry if you are prone to getting headaches from products that have paraben in them.&lt;br /&gt;After using it only 2 times, I have noticed a great difference in my skin tone, smoothness and fine lines!</li>
            <li>It has a nice fruity smell to it that I like very much.</li>
            <li>The texture is heavier, and there are fine cranberry fibers to provide exfoliation when washing.</li>
            <li>And I am so lucky I did!</li>
            <li>I feel they healed more quickly because of the use of the mask.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Using this antioxidant face mask from Retseliney has been a huge blessing to my pores, and makeup caked face.</li>
            <li>I got to try this (free) for my review.</li>
            <li>I received this free product to review.</li>
            <li>It helps get rid of free radicals that get into your skin and pores.&lt;br</li>
            <li>By removing the free radicals your skin begins to tighten, heal and the signs of pre-mature aging are prevented.</li>
            <li>Free product provided for evaluation and review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>(they should help protect against free radical damage and thus fight some of the signs of aging).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The mask feels great going on, it has a tingling feel to it and is dry in about 20 minutes even in my humid house.</li>
            <li>and I felt my skin looked radiant after using it - not to mention it just felt clean.</li>
            <li>This to me smells extremely clean</li>
            <li>use on my clean face.</li>
            <li>think this did help clean out my pores and tone my skin.  </li>
            <li>I give this product a 10 out of 10 and would most certainly buy it again.</li>
            <li>This mask is full of goodies for your skin.</li>
            <li>I can see this product being super beneficial for acne prone skin.</li>
            <li>So double thumbs up :-) :-)</li>
            <li>It left my skin nice, smooth and fresh looking.</li>
            <li>I am in love with how well this face mask works for me, I am seeing less acne and my face has never looked so healthy!</li>
            <li>This is a good mask but do not leave it too long!</li>
            <li>It has a very mild yet pleasant enough fragrance that seems to be coming just from the natural ingredients contained within.</li>
            <li>I found it to be very mild and gentle.  </li>
            <li>The powerful antioxidant packed berries in the #Retseliney Fruit Mask include blueberry, cranberry, Oregon Grape, bayberry, cayenne and seabuckthorn.</li>
            <li>Example fresh soapy scent.</li>
            <li>There are no artificial dyes, parabens, phthalates, fragrances or sulfates.  </li>
            <li>If you are worried that it might be too much, I encourage you to do a patch test somewhere like your inner elbow, where the skin is also fairly sensitive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>These facial creams offer an exfoliant and antioxidant to leave your skin feeling good as new within days.</li>
            <li>Great for young or aging skin,  oily or dry, women and men.&lt;br</li>
            <li>fruit cocktail masque by Retseliney is a blend of antioxidant berries and if used twice weekly to leave on the skin for 15 minutes will leave your skin and complexion smooth and looking like new.</li>
            <li>The mask was very gentle</li>
            <li>VERY easy to apply and does not take long to see</li>
            <li>My skin felt soft, smooth and renewed after using this.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>The reason for this is the naturally derived antioxidants in this mask remove the free radicals from your skin.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend trying it out!!</li>
            <li>I am in total love with this product.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I know which masks are really good and which are just plain stuff that will do nothing for my skin.  </li>
            <li>Just looking at the ingredient list, I can see many targeted towards improving skin condition and fighting free radicals, including green tea, blueberry extract, grape, apple, and lemon.</li>
            <li>really do appreciate this masque so much!</li>
            <li>/&gt;This mask includes glycolic acid which has been quite good in the past for me for clearing up breakouts.  </li>
            <li>am highly satisfied with this facial mask and would highly recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;I received the Retseliney Fruit Cocktail Antioxidant face mask in exchange of an unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li>you slather this on pretty thickly and get the neck too, this container is probably good for 4-5 uses.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend these products!</li>
            <li>it is important to begin using a mask such as the #Retseliney Fruit Mask.</li>
            <li>This mask includes Kaolin clay which is very purifying.</li>
            <li>but I like this so much I will be using this as my face mask from now on.</li>
            <li>It was not irritating to my skin at all.</li>
            <li>haven&#x27;t noticed much improvement,but&lt;br</li>
            <li>What I really like about this product is the ingredients.</li>
            <li>The mask is gently with no tingling sensation or burning.  </li>
            <li>Because of the glycolic acid, which is an alpha-hydroxy acid, you should use a good sunscreen on days you use this product (or at least the day after, if you use the mask at night).  </li>
            <li>Regular face wash just doesn&#x27;t cut it, while my face does become clean, it&#x27;s not the deep clean</li>
            <li>First, I used the Antioxidant Masque first, and left it on for about 20 minutes as it says to leave it on for 15 to 30 minutes. </li>
            <li>First off, when you first open this jar and smell it..</li>
            <li>According to Retseliney, their professional mask is a &amp;#34;super hit&amp;#34; of Antioxidant which is designed to reverse the oxidizing free radical process for smoother, younger, happier and vibrant skin.  </li>
            <li>(Actually you should use a good sunscreen everyday, anyway, but that&#x27;s beside the point...)  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive and aging skin and am very particular about what products I use.  </li>
            <li>Wow!!</li>
            <li>love the smell of this mask - it is like fruit cocktail with heavy grape overtones.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After the 30 minutes is over or when the face mask is completely dry I remove it using a circular motion with a wet warm wash cloth or face sponge.</li>
            <li>My face is left feeling very clean, I can visibly see that all of my blackheads are removed and the dry skin around my nose is gone.</li>
            <li>rinse my face completely and pat dry with a clean towel.</li>
            <li>It is a tiny bit drying, but since I am using it only on my T-zone where I tend towards mild oiliness, that is actually fine and to be expected.</li>
            <li>Usually my skin gets so dry when I apply any mask but this mask makes my skin so soft, clean and smooth.</li>
            <li>I am hoping this product will help clear up some acne marks.</li>
            <li>My face is so soft.</li>
            <li>All the products are made of natural ingredients and feature organic</li>
            <li>If you have a Rosehip seed oil that smells like roses send it back because it isnt the real thing.</li>
            <li>Wow soft radiant skin.</li>
            <li>It is made with natural and organic ingredients.</li>
            <li>I have a lot of them and I use them frequently.</li>
            <li>The face mask contains vitamin c, grapeseed oil, blueberry extract, sweet almond oil, rosehip oil and green tea.</li>
            <li>It does seem to brighten skin some, and it leaves my pores nice and tight and looking small.  </li>
            <li>I was not required to write a positive review nor was I compensated in any other way.</li>
            <li>though it is clay, it is very moisturizing and leaves skin feeling very soft, and not at all tight.  </li>
            <li>Retseliney Fruit Cocktail Antioxidant facial mask has all the natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>It behaves a bit more like a clay mask in that you apply it fairly thickly and let it dry on your face.  </li>
            <li>It did not dry out my skin</li>
            <li>I have sensitive and dry skin.</li>

            <li> The mask feels great going on, it has a tingling feel to it and is dry in about 20 minutes even in my humid house.</li>
            <li> and I felt my skin looked radiant after using it - not to mention it just felt clean.</li>
            <li> This to me smells extremely clean</li>
            <li> use on my clean face.</li>
            <li> think this did help clean out my pores and tone my skin.  </li>
            <li> I give this product a 10 out of 10 and would most certainly buy it again.</li>
            <li> This mask is full of goodies for your skin.</li>
            <li> I can see this product being super beneficial for acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> So double thumbs up :-) :-)</li>
            <li> It left my skin nice, smooth and fresh looking.</li>
            <li> I am in love with how well this face mask works for me, I am seeing less acne and my face has never looked so healthy!</li>
            <li> This is a good mask but do not leave it too long!</li>
            <li> It has a very mild yet pleasant enough fragrance that seems to be coming just from the natural ingredients contained within.</li>
            <li> I found it to be very mild and gentle.  </li>
            <li> The powerful antioxidant packed berries in the #Retseliney Fruit Mask include blueberry, cranberry, Oregon Grape, bayberry, cayenne and seabuckthorn.</li>
            <li> Example fresh soapy scent.</li>
            <li> There are no artificial dyes, parabens, phthalates, fragrances or sulfates.  </li>
            <li> If you are worried that it might be too much, I encourage you to do a patch test somewhere like your inner elbow, where the skin is also fairly sensitive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> These facial creams offer an exfoliant and antioxidant to leave your skin feeling good as new within days.</li>
            <li> Great for young or aging skin,  oily or dry, women and men.&lt;br</li>
            <li> fruit cocktail masque by Retseliney is a blend of antioxidant berries and if used twice weekly to leave on the skin for 15 minutes will leave your skin and complexion smooth and looking like new.</li>
            <li> The mask was very gentle</li>
            <li> VERY easy to apply and does not take long to see</li>
            <li> My skin felt soft, smooth and renewed after using this.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> The reason for this is the naturally derived antioxidants in this mask remove the free radicals from your skin.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend trying it out!!</li>
            <li> I am in total love with this product.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I know which masks are really good and which are just plain stuff that will do nothing for my skin.  </li>
            <li> Just looking at the ingredient list, I can see many targeted towards improving skin condition and fighting free radicals, including green tea, blueberry extract, grape, apple, and lemon.</li>
            <li> really do appreciate this masque so much!</li>
            <li> /&gt;This mask includes glycolic acid which has been quite good in the past for me for clearing up breakouts.  </li>
            <li> am highly satisfied with this facial mask and would highly recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;I received the Retseliney Fruit Cocktail Antioxidant face mask in exchange of an unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li> you slather this on pretty thickly and get the neck too, this container is probably good for 4-5 uses.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend these products!</li>
            <li> it is important to begin using a mask such as the #Retseliney Fruit Mask.</li>
            <li> This mask includes Kaolin clay which is very purifying.</li>
            <li> but I like this so much I will be using this as my face mask from now on.</li>
            <li> It was not irritating to my skin at all.</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t noticed much improvement,but&lt;br</li>
            <li> What I really like about this product is the ingredients.</li>
            <li> The mask is gently with no tingling sensation or burning.  </li>
            <li> Because of the glycolic acid, which is an alpha-hydroxy acid, you should use a good sunscreen on days you use this product (or at least the day after, if you use the mask at night).  </li>
            <li> Regular face wash just doesn&#x27;t cut it, while my face does become clean, it&#x27;s not the deep clean</li>
            <li> First, I used the Antioxidant Masque first, and left it on for about 20 minutes as it says to leave it on for 15 to 30 minutes. </li>
            <li> First off, when you first open this jar and smell it..</li>
            <li> According to Retseliney, their professional mask is a &amp;#34;super hit&amp;#34; of Antioxidant which is designed to reverse the oxidizing free radical process for smoother, younger, happier and vibrant skin.  </li>
            <li> (Actually you should use a good sunscreen everyday, anyway, but that&#x27;s beside the point...)  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive and aging skin and am very particular about what products I use.  </li>
            <li> Wow!!</li>
            <li> love the smell of this mask - it is like fruit cocktail with heavy grape overtones.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After the 30 minutes is over or when the face mask is completely dry I remove it using a circular motion with a wet warm wash cloth or face sponge.</li>
            <li> My face is left feeling very clean, I can visibly see that all of my blackheads are removed and the dry skin around my nose is gone.</li>
            <li> rinse my face completely and pat dry with a clean towel.</li>
            <li> It is a tiny bit drying, but since I am using it only on my T-zone where I tend towards mild oiliness, that is actually fine and to be expected.</li>
            <li> Usually my skin gets so dry when I apply any mask but this mask makes my skin so soft, clean and smooth.</li>
            <li> I am hoping this product will help clear up some acne marks.</li>
            <li> My face is so soft.</li>
            <li> All the products are made of natural ingredients and feature organic</li>
            <li> If you have a Rosehip seed oil that smells like roses send it back because it isnt the real thing.</li>
            <li> Wow soft radiant skin.</li>
            <li> It is made with natural and organic ingredients.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of them and I use them frequently.</li>
            <li> The face mask contains vitamin c, grapeseed oil, blueberry extract, sweet almond oil, rosehip oil and green tea.</li>
            <li> It does seem to brighten skin some, and it leaves my pores nice and tight and looking small.  </li>
            <li> I was not required to write a positive review nor was I compensated in any other way.</li>
            <li> though it is clay, it is very moisturizing and leaves skin feeling very soft, and not at all tight.  </li>
            <li> Retseliney Fruit Cocktail Antioxidant facial mask has all the natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> It behaves a bit more like a clay mask in that you apply it fairly thickly and let it dry on your face.  </li>
            <li> It did not dry out my skin</li>
            <li> I have sensitive and dry skin.</li>
            <li> While the face mask is drying on my face I can feel small tingles, but it actually feels really good.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The skin will be even and have less blemishes and feel soft to the touch.</li>
            <li> The moment I put this facial mask, I felt the cold and refreshing.</li>
            <li> The products get down under the skin to remove old dead skin cells and clear up impurities.</li>
            <li> So it&#x27;s hard to find anything to really make a difference.</li>
            <li> This is less expensive and I think it leaves your skin looking better than Glam Glow.</li>
            <li> The jar appears to be tiny but you only need a little bit of the product for your neck and face.</li>
            <li> I used this only once a week due to time constraints</li>
            <li> My skin felt softer, smoother and my pores were less noticeable than they were prior to using the mask.</li>
            <li> (If you use less, of course, the container will last longer.)  </li>
            <li> I think all clay facial masks can be a little bit drying, which is why you use a serum and moisturizer afterwards.</li>
            <li> I left it on for 20 minutes or so till it completely dried off</li>
            <li> Wearing makeup daily produces debris trapped into my pores, and creases.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It also has cranberry and Oregon grape, as well as other fruits in it.</li>
            <li> I noticed somebody said it smells like roses due to rosehip seed oil being in it.</li>
            <li> and I did not have any allergic reaction to it on the other hand</li>
            <li> then I wet my fingers with water and massage in circular motion to exfoliate the dead skin.</li>
            <li> The products are featured on Amazon for slightly under $20 and improve skin tone and texture.</li>
            <li> So a dollar to less than a dollar per mask.</li>
            <li> The mask also gave a slight tingling feeling, not burning but feeling as if something is working on my face.</li>
            <li> When applied to the skin it has a rough, sandy texture to it and if this does not irritate your sensitive skin, then you will find that it removes a lot of the blackheads, whiteheads and dead skin cells that leave your face looking dull and unhealthy.</li>
            <li> review is on a few products from Retseliney.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It removes the signs of aging, dead skin and improves the skin texture.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about getting it initially.</li>
            <li> You can rub it in small circles as it dries to exfoliate a bit.  </li>
            <li> I am a mask fanatic.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a peel-off mask and it&#x27;s not a clay mask, although like both of those types, you do apply it and leave it for at least 15 minutes, then remove.  </li>
            <li> but I did have to spread it out as it is thick.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Directions are to put a thick layer on, and to leave it for 15-30 minutes.  </li>
            <li> It is thick and has some exfoliating material in it.</li>
            <li> I apply a semi thick layer on my face and neck and let it sit for 15-20 mins</li>
            <li> It did feel tingly, especially on my cheeks, but it wasn&#x27;t painful at all.</li>
            <li> jar of antioxidant face mask is very thick and concentrated.</li>
            <li> However, while it tightens, it doesn&#x27;t get hard and pull your skin uncomfortably like some clay masks</li>
            <li> and then it felt like a thin masque.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for approximately a week, every night.  </li>
            <li> and I applied it in thin paste.</li>
            <li> I had bad experience in the past from a clay mask after that I a break to my skin to recover from acne.</li>
            <li> No parabens, artificial dyes, fragrances, or sulfates and never test on animals.  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> I got to try this (free) for my review. And I am so lucky I did! I love it!  My skin is glowing!  I have pretty good skin to begin with. So it&#x27;s hard to find anything to really make a difference. But this does! My face is so soft. And I swear I look younger.  Great product! A must have.</li>
            <li> First, I used the Antioxidant Masque first, and left it on for about 20 minutes as it says to leave it on for 15 to 30 minutes. &lt;br /&gt;While it was on, I could feel the creamy texture kind of harden a bit, then I couldn&#x27;t feel it anymore unless I touched it and then it felt like a thin masque. I loved it. My skin felt soft, smooth and renewed after using this.&lt;br /&gt;The masque didn&#x27;t have a strong scent but I could pick out the fruity scents, especially the blueberry. It also has cranberry and Oregon grape, as well as other fruits in it. These products are definitely a great choice for skin care products.&lt;br /&gt;I got to try these products free through Tomoson as part of a product trial but the experience and opinions in this post are my own unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li> **I received this free product to review. I was not required to write a positive review nor was I compensated in any other way. The opinions I have expressed are my own. I am disclosing this in accordance with the FTC Regulations.**&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This review is on a few products from Retseliney. These facial creams offer an exfoliant and antioxidant to leave your skin feeling good as new within days. The products are featured on Amazon for slightly under $20 and improve skin tone and texture. The products get down under the skin to remove old dead skin cells and clear up impurities. All the products are made of natural ingredients and feature organic product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cream is white and has no fragrance. When applied to the skin it has a rough, sandy texture to it and if this does not irritate your sensitive skin, then you will find that it removes a lot of the blackheads, whiteheads and dead skin cells that leave your face looking dull and unhealthy. VERY easy to apply and does not take long to see results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fruit cocktail masque by Retseliney is a blend of antioxidant berries and if used twice weekly to leave on the skin for 15 minutes will leave your skin and complexion smooth and looking like new. The skin will be even and have less blemishes and feel soft to the touch. I highly recommend these products!</li>
            <li> Wow!! This masque is absolutely amazing! First off, when you first open this jar and smell it..omg! It&#x27;s packed with antioxidants that your skin just soaks up! It helps get rid of free radicals that get into your skin and pores.&lt;br /&gt;It is paraben free so you don&#x27;t have to worry if you are prone to getting headaches from products that have paraben in them.&lt;br /&gt;After using it only 2 times, I have noticed a great difference in my skin tone, smoothness and fine lines! This is a must have!</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:fd24adb78c198efaa1d97bd2d8ab959b]]As we age it is important to begin using a mask such as the #Retseliney Fruit Mask. The reason for this is the naturally derived antioxidants in this mask remove the free radicals from your skin. By removing the free radicals your skin begins to tighten, heal and the signs of pre-mature aging are prevented. Make also help to deeply nourish your skin, even out the skin tone, texture and give you a smoother complexion. The powerful antioxidant packed berries in the #Retseliney Fruit Mask include blueberry, cranberry, Oregon Grape, bayberry, cayenne and seabuckthorn. It also contains Glycolic Acid, Hyaluronic Acid, CoQ10, Rosehip Oil, Jojoba Oil and peptides to give the boost, lift, brighten skin and add anti-gaining benefits to the mask.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the smell of this mask - it is like fruit cocktail with heavy grape overtones. The mask feels great going on, it has a tingling feel to it and is dry in about 20 minutes even in my humid house. It rinsed away easily with warm water and a washrag. My skin felt softer, smoother and my pores were less noticeable than they were prior to using the mask. The mask was very gentle and I felt my skin looked radiant after using it - not to mention it just felt clean. I have combination skin and often my skin feels oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t feel it took a lot of the mask to go on my face - but I did have to spread it out as it is thick. I like that it is vegan and contains organic ingredients. This is another great product by #Reseliney.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: I did receive this product for free or at a reduced price in exchange for my honest, unbiased review. All opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:b8fb13994d2724e8ee4e43a02d4a0749]] I love using a nice mask once a week as part of my skincare routine. I was especially intrigued by Retseliney&#x27;s Fruit Cocktail Antioxidant Facial Mask because it has such a wide range of natural and organic ingredients. Just looking at the ingredient list, I can see many targeted towards improving skin condition and fighting free radicals, including green tea, blueberry extract, grape, apple, and lemon. There are also an assortment of amazing oils for hydration, including rose hip, tamanu, sweet almond oil, coconut oil, grapeseed and raspberry seed oils. They also do not test their products on animals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The jar of antioxidant face mask is very thick and concentrated. The texture is heavier, and there are fine cranberry fibers to provide exfoliation when washing. The mask has a fruity smell that is pleasant. I found the mask very easy to apply in a thing layer. The instructions say to wear for 15 to 30 minutes then wash off. It did feel tingly, especially on my cheeks, but it wasn&#x27;t painful at all. My skin looked more youthful and refreshed after using it. It also brightened my skin tone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;****I received this item for free in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.****</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:547fc83a243f94a585a079ae979abc53]] This product was sent to me gratis for an unbiased opinion which I have given.</li>
            <li> This is the best skin care product that I ever bought. I was skeptical about getting it initially. I read all the reviews. I decided to give it a try. This is the best money that I&#x27;ve ever spent. This product made my pores so much smaller and I searched/tried so many of products for pores. Nothing ever worked. It was actually making me depressed. So I began buying alot of make up. Well now I won&#x27;t need all that make up. This product is amazing. I&#x27;m in awe. I&#x27;m going to buy their other products because I am more than impressed. This is honestly the best product and I  so amazed.</li>
            <li> Free product provided for evaluation and review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This  is somewhat pleasant to use. I like the effects of the mask better than the experience of putting it on and using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  My first impression was that the jar was rather small, but it really only takes a tiny bit. There are several applications in the jar.  It smells medicinal.  I don&#x27;t care for the smell but it&#x27;s tolerable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though it is clay, it is very moisturizing and leaves skin feeling very soft, and not at all tight.  It does seem to brighten skin some, and it leaves my pores nice and tight and looking small.  I do like that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Directions are to put a thick layer on, and to leave it for 15-30 minutes.  It states it might tingle some, because of the glycolic acid, but I did not experience that.  You can rub it in small circles as it dries to exfoliate a bit.  I didn&#x27;t find it all that exfoliating though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does rinse off quite easily with just warm water.</li>
            <li> I am a mask fanatic. You name it I have a mask for the cure! This to me smells extremely clean Example fresh soapy scent. I noticed somebody said it smells like roses due to rosehip seed oil being in it. Well rosehip seed oil has no smell to it at all!! I use it nightly! If you have a Rosehip seed oil that smells like roses send it back because it isnt the real thing. This mask is full of goodies for your skin. I did not get the stingle but my skin is used to glycolic acid. I get peels and use it nightly in my night cream. I find this mask to be almost cooling on my skin. It feels great. I am sitting here with 10 minutes to go on it and it really feels great. My skin is acne prone. I am hoping this product will help clear up some acne marks. Ok well just washed mask off. Wow soft radiant skin. The red marks I had from pimples are lighter!! Oh this is a staple in my beauty routine from now on. My skin could tolerate this 2 times a week. Oh it makes your skin glow beautifully. I do love the fact that it exfoliates while cleaning off. I can see this product being super beneficial for acne prone skin. Now on to what the directions say. After using this product cleanse skin with your cleanser toner then serum and or night cream. I have to say I like this mask better than Glam Glows brightening mask!! This is less expensive and I think it leaves your skin looking better than Glam Glow. So happy I found this product. The jar appears to be tiny but you only need a little bit of the product for your neck and face. I am guessing but there are about 20 to 30 masks in this container. So a dollar to less than a dollar per mask. I love that!! Beautiful radiant skin awaits you. I highly recommend this product. I know alot about skin care and masks because I worked in a dermatologists office. So double thumbs up :-) :-) this is a high end product for a great price. This is the perfect blend of ingredients.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive and aging skin and am very particular about what products I use.  I have been using a number of Retseliney products and they have all been excellent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ingredients are good, with a number of organic ingredients included.  This mask includes Kaolin clay which is very purifying. It feels good and leaves your skin sparkling clean and exfoliated as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did receive a sample for review but I like this so much I will be using this as my face mask from now on. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive and dry skin. I had bad experience in the past from a clay mask after that I a break to my skin to recover from acne. Then I got the opportunity to try Retseliney Fruit Cocktail Antioxidant face mask and give my honest opinion. Retseliney Fruit Cocktail Antioxidant facial mask has all the natural ingredients. The face mask contains vitamin c, grapeseed oil, blueberry extract, sweet almond oil, rosehip oil and green tea. It is thick and has some exfoliating material in it. It smells like blueberries.&lt;br /&gt;It removes the signs of aging, dead skin and improves the skin texture. It makes my skin youthful and gives a healthy glow.&lt;br /&gt;I use on my clean face. I apply a semi thick layer on my face and neck and let it sit for 15-20 mins then I wet my fingers with water and massage in circular motion to exfoliate the dead skin. I rinse it in the shower. I feel a big difference in my skin. Usually my skin gets so dry when I apply any mask but this mask makes my skin so soft, clean and smooth. The mask feels tingly when you put on your face. I feel tingly on my nose, forehead and apple of the cheeks.&lt;br /&gt;This face mask is perfect for any skin type. I am so glad to see the results on my skin. It has no side effects. It is cruelty free.&lt;br /&gt;I am highly satisfied with this facial mask and would highly recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;I received the Retseliney Fruit Cocktail Antioxidant face mask in exchange of an unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:a9f6cba9d5c345adb10b9af38191dc0a]]*I received this item for free in exchange for my honest and unbiased review*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really do appreciate this masque so much! I love the fresh smell of it and it has that tingling sensation but it is not too strong like most masks can be. It was not irritating to my skin at all. I would highly recommend trying it out!! You will love it!</li>
            <li> This is a great face mask with wonderful ingredients.  No parabens, artificial dyes, fragrances, or sulfates and never test on animals.  Just good stuff for your skin.  The mask cleaned out my pores and let my skin looking beautiful.  Great for young or aging skin,  oily or dry, women and men.&lt;br /&gt;*Sample provided for review.</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t noticed much improvement,but&lt;br /&gt;love the cream</li>
            <li> This is a very nice clay mask, and I found it very effective at reducing the number of small breakouts I get around my T-zone area. It has a very mild yet pleasant enough fragrance that seems to be coming just from the natural ingredients contained within. It is a tiny bit drying, but since I am using it only on my T-zone where I tend towards mild oiliness, that is actually fine and to be expected. I think all clay facial masks can be a little bit drying, which is why you use a serum and moisturizer afterwards. I received a sample for review but the opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> According to Retseliney, their professional mask is a &amp;#34;super hit&amp;#34; of Antioxidant which is designed to reverse the oxidizing free radical process for smoother, younger, happier and vibrant skin.  They claim that their product is safe for all skin types and is suitable for both men and women.  What I really like about this product is the ingredients. Blueberry, cranberry, Oregon grape, bayberry, cayenne and seabuckthorn as well as gylcolic cid, hyaluronic acid, CoQ10, rosehip oil, peptides, and jojoba oil.  It is made with natural and organic ingredients. What&#x27;s best? They don&#x27;t test on animals.  There are no artificial dyes, parabens, phthalates, fragrances or sulfates.  I love this mask. I&#x27;ve been using it for approximately a week, every night.  My skin is smoother, radiant and feels good.  The mask is gently with no tingling sensation or burning.  Plus, it smells amazing.  I give this product a 10 out of 10 and would most certainly buy it again.</li>

            <li> I love face masks. I have a lot of them and I use them frequently. I know which masks are really good and which are just plain stuff that will do nothing for my skin.  I tried this facial mask. It has a tooth paste consistency and I applied it in thin paste. The moment I put this facial mask, I felt the cold and refreshing. The mask also gave a slight tingling feeling, not burning but feeling as if something is working on my face. I left it on for 20 minutes or so till it completely dried off and then I removed it off with a sponge. It left my skin nice, smooth and fresh looking. It has a nice fruity smell to it that I like very much. I have used the mask two times now and I did not have any allergic reaction to it on the other hand I found it to be very mild and gentle.

            <li> This is a different take on a face mask.  It&#x27;s not a peel-off mask and it&#x27;s not a clay mask, although like both of those types, you do apply it and leave it for at least 15 minutes, then remove.  It behaves a bit more like a clay mask in that you apply it fairly thickly and let it dry on your face.  However, while it tightens, it doesn&#x27;t get hard and pull your skin uncomfortably like some clay masks can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This mask includes glycolic acid which has been quite good in the past for me for clearing up breakouts.  Because of the glycolic acid, which is an alpha-hydroxy acid, you should use a good sunscreen on days you use this product (or at least the day after, if you use the mask at night).  (Actually you should use a good sunscreen everyday, anyway, but that&#x27;s beside the point...)  It did tingle for me a bit but my skin was not red when I took the mask off.  If you are worried that it might be too much, I encourage you to do a patch test somewhere like your inner elbow, where the skin is also fairly sensitive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this did help clean out my pores and tone my skin.  I also think it helped with some breakouts I was having -- I feel they healed more quickly because of the use of the mask.  It did not dry out my skin and I love all the antioxidants (they should help protect against free radical damage and thus fight some of the signs of aging).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you slather this on pretty thickly and get the neck too, this container is probably good for 4-5 uses.  (If you use less, of course, the container will last longer.)  I used this only once a week due to time constraints but I did see some effects even then.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product provided by the seller for evaluation purposes.</li>
            <li> Two times a week I like to get my face deeply cleaned to remove any build up in my pores. Regular face wash just doesn&#x27;t cut it, while my face does become clean, it&#x27;s not the deep clean I am looking for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using this antioxidant face mask from Retseliney has been a huge blessing to my pores, and makeup caked face. Wearing makeup daily produces debris trapped into my pores, and creases.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The face mask applies easily - I just use my fingers to spread it around, keeping away from my eyes-mouth-nose openings. I then leave it on for about 30 minutes. While the face mask is drying on my face I can feel small tingles, but it actually feels really good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the 30 minutes is over or when the face mask is completely dry I remove it using a circular motion with a wet warm wash cloth or face sponge. The oils in the face mask and the grainy texture of the mix helps to remove any remaining dry/dead skin while I am removing the mask in a circular motion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I rinse my face completely and pat dry with a clean towel. My face is left feeling very clean, I can visibly see that all of my blackheads are removed and the dry skin around my nose is gone. I am in love with how well this face mask works for me, I am seeing less acne and my face has never looked so healthy! Sample provided for evaluation and review.</li>
