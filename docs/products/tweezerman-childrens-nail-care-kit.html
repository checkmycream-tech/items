            <li>This scissor is awesome!</li>
            <li>I love these!!!</li>
            <li>The scissors arent that great and the clippers are crummy.</li>
            <li>and they are happy with the product.</li>
            <li>So I am hoping with my newborn we will change this cycle and have as pleasant a time we can have with nail trimming.</li>
            <li>WELL worth the $$!!!!</li>
            <li>but this one was just not doing any good - neither the tweezer, nor the scissors.</li>
            <li>I love the Tweezerman Children&#x27;s nail care kit, the scissors work great.  </li>
            <li>To have a fresh start I found the best baby manicure set ever!</li>
            <li>It is also satisfying as heck to see those claws come off!  </li>
            <li>The scissor is amazing but even better is the nail clipper!</li>
            <li>The scissors are great, easy to use; polisher is kind of blunt.</li>
            <li>The nail scissors are nice, and work quite well.  </li>
            <li>But the nail scissors are quite handy and work well.</li>
            <li>the files are wonderful to complete the act...</li>
            <li>so baby is sure to get a nice trim.</li>
            <li>and easy!  </li>
            <li>I love love love the scissors!</li>
            <li>I am aboslutely in love with it.</li>
            <li>The file is OK &amp; I haven&#x27;t used the scissors.</li>
            <li>I like the scissors so much more.  </li>
            <li>and then I am easily able to trim his nails.  </li>
            <li>I have used these before twice and gifted to others also.</li>
            <li>I never use the magnifier but the quality of the clippers seems much better.</li>
            <li>I lost my first pair and I am buying another kit!!!</li>
            <li>They are tools that are easy to use and very precise</li>
            <li>Many times,the clipper wouldn&#x27;t even make a clean cut</li>
            <li>It is really easy to use</li>
            <li>these scissors make it SO easy.  </li>
            <li>The little scissors are the best the in the world for clipping an infants nails.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s all great, but I just wanted to send the product back and get a refund.</li>
            <li>for the individual product, I know tweezerman makes great kits</li>
            <li>I primarily bought this set because of the scissors.</li>
            <li>The reviews for the scissor are great, and I would get the kit just because each part is useful and the price difference is small.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not been able to use the scissors while my daughter is awake, but when shes napping, its silent, well controlled (no nipping her!)</li>
            <li>As a huge fan of tweezerman I was excited to find a childrens nail kit.  </li>
            <li>It clips so clean and well.</li>
            <li>But the Tweezerman scissors are good quality and cut his soft fingernails smoothly the first time.</li>
            <li>So keeping their nails trim and clean is so important this set has everything you need which makes life so much easier.</li>
            <li>I love using the scissors on my new grandson.  </li>
            <li>I can get them pretty short because I am able to see his finger to make sure I am not cutting it.</li>
            <li>but these I bought myself and were worth it.</li>
            <li>and I could FEDEX the product back to them (at my own expense) and</li>
            <li>However, the scissors alone make it worth the splurge.</li>
            <li>I was hesitant to spend $22 on these baby scissors but they were worth every penny.</li>
            <li>kit has it all and well worth it.  </li>
            <li>Works perfectly but looks poorly finished</li>
            <li>What parent in their right mind would wait weeks to cut newborns nails.</li>
            <li>The nail clippers and fingernail brush are just the right size.</li>
            <li>I always cut my kiddos nails while they were sleeping but even then if you don’t have the right tools it can be a disaster.</li>
            <li>The file worked fine, but you could probably use any old file.  </li>
            <li>The scissors make everything so much easier!  </li>
            <li>and for the first couple of times afterwards and then switched to the scissors.  </li>
            <li>I have only used the scissors from the set, but I love them.  </li>
            <li>when my son was first born I exclusively filed his nails</li>
            <li>Baby’s nails grow so quickly and they have a tendency to scratch themselves especially their beautiful little faces.</li>
            <li>I had my eye on this for a long time since I love my Tweezerman tweezers...</li>
            <li>The clippers are much sharper than the Safety</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t found much use for the nail clippers or the brush.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>You have so much control with the scissors</li>
            <li>what I really like about this set is that everything is made with baby in mind.</li>
            <li>In the past I have used cheap scissors that just didn&#x27;t cut the nails smoothly.  </li>
            <li>(The First Years American Red Cross Deluxe Nail Clipper with Magnifier).</li>
            <li>The scissors are great - nice and sharp for cutting those baby nails but also rounded at the tip</li>
            <li>I will use the clippers when she is a bit older.  </li>
            <li>Save yourself the hassle and spend a little more for a quality product.</li>
            <li>Particularly the scissors are brilliant for cutting the baby nails...</li>
            <li>for a first time mom who has barely handled babies before, it has been an invaluable purchase</li>
            <li>I have had two different Safety first clippers that are much</li>
            <li>They are just the right size for getting around tiny fingers.  </li>
            <li>I have told all my new mom friends about these.</li>
            <li>Bought for use by my daughter for the new baby</li>
            <li>They are little and just really easy to use considering clipping an infants nails is like trying you clip the nails of a cat.</li>
            <li>They said they receive 12 bags of mail every day and were busy.</li>
            <li>Baby&#x27;s fourteen months old and no accidents, knock wood.</li>
            <li>I used the file when my daughter was just a couple days old because I was too scared to try the clippers or the scissors.  </li>
            <li>The scissors are great--I started using them when my daughter was about 6 weeks old</li>
            <li>Even now with a five and a three year old</li>
            <li>My 10 month old LOVES to hold the nail file which has a teddy bear pattern.</li>
            <li>using scissors is SO much easier to cut tiny nails.</li>
            <li>I have an 8 month old, and I have been \\&quot;filing\\&quot;</li>
            <li>/&gt;The scissors are shaped in such a way that unless you child has super long nails...</li>
            <li>I have gotten quite a few different nail scissors and clipper, but most of them cut very poorly (not sharp at all).</li>
            <li>, brush (bristles are too long to get under baby&#x27;s nails), and clippers aren&#x27;t much use.</li>
            <li>I think a file is useful still to dull the nail and any points made by imperfect cuts, but its minimal use and easy enough to do that when baby is up.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re made of a hard plastic that feels rather cheap.</li>
            <li>but really would I have spent $30 for those?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>i will be buying these for any of my friends having babies in the near future.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my newborn, and only used the scissors and the nail polisher so far.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great not to worry about cutting her little fingers when clipping her nails.</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s great not to worry about cutting her little fingers when clipping her nails.</li>
            <li> First one, which makes them much easier to use for a difficult task of keeping Baby&#x27;s nails short.</li>
            <li> Nail clippers are loud, less controlled and intimidating, but I like that the kit comes with one, so that once I build confidence/ my baby is a little older, it may be quicker... who knows?  </li>
            <li> I got a new set for my little baby.</li>
            <li> I bought these when my baby was less than a month old.  </li>
            <li> But I am hoping I can simply send it back and get my refund and let the seller handle the warranty etc since I just opened it and used it once to find that it wasn&#x27;t sharp and did not meet the expectations we had.</li>
            <li> I love the scissors for cutting my baby&#x27;s nails.</li>
            <li> We use the scissors regularly and they&#x27;re still sharp where they should be, but nowhere else.</li>
            <li> I used the nail file at the hospital (my daughter was born with long nails!)</li>
            <li> The nail clippers are fairly useless, they broke almost immediatley after I used it for the first or second time.  </li>
            <li> the scissors are sharp enough to cut my baby&#x27;s nails but not so sharp that they cut her skin.  </li>
            <li> and I like the company&#x27;s green and social commitment....</li>
            <li> The new scissors were dull and a total waste of money.</li>
            <li> When I got it, it just wasnt sharp enough (they are not usually super sharp but sharp enough for babies)</li>
            <li> and they got back to me quite promptly a few times.</li>
            <li> I dont want to spent on buying another set until I get a refund from this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> they emailed me back...apologized and said that they would exchange this kit for one of their other products... which I did...</li>
            <li> I disagree with the other review.</li>
            <li> The brush is pretty useless for a baby.  </li>
            <li> And I&#x27;ve never used the other products.  </li>
            <li> I still have the scissors and they are still sharp.</li>
            <li> I give these a 0 - over priced and you have to buy the entire kit to get dull scissors.</li>
            <li> the the nail edge is all rough and uneven.</li>
            <li> I finally invested in this kit because I was seriously filling his nails like everyday.</li>
            <li> I wait until my little one is sleeping</li>
            <li> I just wish they were a little safer.  </li>
            <li> I thought it might be a little bit tricker, but not at all.</li>
            <li> If you are not familiar with Tweezerman, then let the quality speak for itself.  </li>
            <li> I made a huge mistake on buying the cheapie version and got grief from my wife because that one fell apart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I received a few sets of nail kits as baby gifts</li>
            <li> In a late night internet shopping spree, I broke down and splurged on this nail kit.  </li>
            <li> i usually wait until she&#x27;s sleeping just to make it easier on myself.  </li>
            <li> PS - Amazon requires that you give a product at least a 1 -</li>

            <li> Awesome kit!!! Particularly the scissors are brilliant for cutting the baby nails... the files are wonderful to complete the act... for a first time mom who has barely handled babies before, it has been an invaluable purchase</li>
            <li> I love the Tweezerman Children&#x27;s nail care kit, the scissors work great.  I received a few sets of nail kits as baby gifts but these I bought myself and were worth it.</li>
            <li> I had my eye on this for a long time since I love my Tweezerman tweezers... and I like the company&#x27;s green and social commitment.... so I finally gave into temptation and bought this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheap China plastic.... clippers fall out of and slip around in the plastic handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is hands down the worst clipper I have seen or used.  I have had two different Safety first clippers that are much better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scissors are shaped in such a way that unless you child has super long nails... you&#x27;ll never get a snip in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess the nail file and brush are o.k. but really would I have spent $30 for those?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shame on you Tweezerman for luring mother&#x27;s into overspending for a useless kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Follow-up:  I contacted the company to voice my opinion... they emailed me back...apologized and said that they would exchange this kit for one of their other products... which I did... I think that is excellent customer service!!!!</li>
            <li> This is the BEST baby nail set ever. I have gotten quite a few different nail scissors and clipper, but most of them cut very poorly (not sharp at all). Many times,the clipper wouldn&#x27;t even make a clean cut the the nail edge is all rough and uneven. But NOT the Tweezerman set! The scissor is amazing but even better is the nail clipper! It clips so clean and well. I am aboslutely in love with it.</li>
            <li> The clippers are much sharper than the Safety First one, which makes them much easier to use for a difficult task of keeping Baby&#x27;s nails short.</li>
            <li> best nail kit I have purchased for my kids. I ordered two, just wish they had different color selections for each kid.</li>
            <li> The new scissors were dull and a total waste of money. I called Tweezerman customer service to see what they could do to help. They said they were 2 weeks behind and I could FEDEX the product back to them (at my own expense) and they could get the product out only once they received it and reviewed the issue. They said they receive 12 bags of mail every day and were busy. What parent in their right mind would wait weeks to cut newborns nails. I&#x27;ll find another company to buy scissors. I give these a 0 - over priced and you have to buy the entire kit to get dull scissors. PS - Amazon requires that you give a product at least a 1 - but I rate it a 0.</li>
            <li> We use the scissors regularly and they&#x27;re still sharp where they should be, but nowhere else. Baby&#x27;s fourteen months old and no accidents, knock wood. The nail file (seriously? you&#x27;re going to file those tiny nails?), brush (bristles are too long to get under baby&#x27;s nails), and clippers aren&#x27;t much use.</li>
            <li> I love using the scissors on my new grandson.  They are just the right size for getting around tiny fingers.  In the past I have used cheap scissors that just didn&#x27;t cut the nails smoothly.  But the Tweezerman scissors are good quality and cut his soft fingernails smoothly the first time.</li>
            <li> As a huge fan of tweezerman I was excited to find a childrens nail kit.  The scissors arent that great and the clippers are crummy.</li>
            <li> I bought these when my baby was less than a month old.  She had started scratching her face and I HATED using the baby clippers.  I could never see where her nail ended and her finger began.  In a late night internet shopping spree, I broke down and splurged on this nail kit.  It is awesome!  The scissors make everything so much easier!  I can actually see what I&#x27;m doing and I&#x27;m not worried about cutting off the tip of her finger.  Of course, I still have to wait until the babe is asleep, but I can know cut her nails - a couple of times per week! - without fear.    I&#x27;ve rated this product as a four only because I haven&#x27;t tried out the nail clippers included in this kit.  However, the scissors alone make it worth the splurge.</li>
            <li> The nail clippers and fingernail brush are just the right size. The file is OK &amp; I haven&#x27;t used the scissors.</li>
            <li> I used the nail file at the hospital (my daughter was born with long nails!) and for the first couple of times afterwards and then switched to the scissors.  I like the scissors so much more.  It is really easy to use, I haven&#x27;t cut her skin at all (thankfully!) and it leaves the nails smoother than with the file.  I haven&#x27;t found much use for the nail clippers or the brush.</li>
            <li> I have only used the scissors from the set, but I love them.  I wait until my little one is sleeping and then I am easily able to trim his nails.  Before I was so scared that I would cut his fingers using clippers.  These work great!  I can get them pretty short because I am able to see his finger to make sure I am not cutting it.</li>
            <li> I disagree with the other review. The little scissors are the best the in the world for clipping an infants nails. I lost my first pair and I am buying another kit!!! I have told all my new mom friends about these.</li>
            <li> I love these!!! when my son was first born I exclusively filed his nails cause I was so nervous to clip them. I finally invested in this kit because I was seriously filling his nails like everyday. These clippers are so awesome I never thought I  would be saying that. They are little and just really easy to use considering clipping an infants nails is like trying you clip the nails of a cat. I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> This item IS a bit pricey.  But, I use tweezerman for my eyebrow tweezers and I knew that they sold quality products, so I decided to give this kit a try.  I&#x27;m VERY happy with it.  It comes with scissors, clippers, a brush and a file.  The brush is pretty useless for a baby.  I used the file when my daughter was just a couple days old because I was too scared to try the clippers or the scissors.  The file worked fine, but you could probably use any old file.  The clippers are quality, but are too big for an infant.  It&#x27;s impossible to clip their tiny fingernails without clipping their skin.  That&#x27;s where the scissors come in.  The scissors are great--I started using them when my daughter was about 6 weeks old and they do the job perfectly.  You have so much control with the scissors--I haven&#x27;t snipped my daughter&#x27;s skin at all.  I will use the clippers when she is a bit older.  I definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Best Nail Scissors for a newborn!!</li>
            <li> I think this is pricey for what you get, but I think that all the kids nail kids I&#x27;ve seen are also similarly over priced.  The nail scissors are nice, and work quite well.  I just wish they were a little safer.  i am constantly worried that I&#x27;m going to leave them out and my baby or toddler is going to hurt themselves with it.  I wish the scissors themselves had some type of built in cover.  The nail clippers are fairly useless, they broke almost immediatley after I used it for the first or second time.  And I&#x27;ve never used the other products.  But the nail scissors are quite handy and work well.</li>
            <li> I have used these before twice and gifted to others also. I got a new set for my little baby. When I got it, it just wasnt sharp enough (they are not usually super sharp but sharp enough for babies) but this one was just not doing any good - neither the tweezer, nor the scissors. Upon closer inspection, they looked scrached too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I emailed the seller and they got back to me quite promptly a few times. I was told that Tweezerman has life-time warranty. That&#x27;s all great, but I just wanted to send the product back and get a refund. I am still waiting to hear from the seller about how to handle this. In the meantime, I am stuck with an expensive tweezer and scissor for my kids which does not work well. I dont want to spent on buying another set until I get a refund from this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the individual product, I know tweezerman makes great kits so I believe I just got a wrong product or one that was used before. It wasn&#x27;t the seller&#x27;s fault, it seems. But I am hoping I can simply send it back and get my refund and let the seller handle the warranty etc since I just opened it and used it once to find that it wasn&#x27;t sharp and did not meet the expectations we had.</li>
            <li> Well made Highest quality</li>
            <li> I love the scissors for cutting my baby&#x27;s nails. It&#x27;s great not to worry about cutting her little fingers when clipping her nails.</li>
            <li> I am in love with these scissors, my family has even teased me saying i am obsessed.  After clipping the tip of my daughters finger with baby nail clippers, i was traumatized.  I was hesitant to spend $22 on these baby scissors but they were worth every penny. i have to cut my daughters nails 2 or 3 times per week to keep her from scratching her face.  these scissors make it SO easy.  i usually wait until she&#x27;s sleeping just to make it easier on myself.  the scissors are sharp enough to cut my baby&#x27;s nails but not so sharp that they cut her skin.  WELL worth the $$!!!! i will be buying these for any of my friends having babies in the near future.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my newborn, and only used the scissors and the nail polisher so far. The scissors are great, easy to use; polisher is kind of blunt.</li>
            <li> Cutting a baby’s nails is nerve racking. I always cut my kiddos nails while they were sleeping but even then if you don’t have the right tools it can be a disaster. Even now with a five and a three year old I am always fighting with them to cut their nails. So I am hoping with my newborn we will change this cycle and have as pleasant a time we can have with nail trimming. To have a fresh start I found the best baby manicure set ever! The Tweezerman Baby Manicure Kit what I really like about this set is that everything is made with baby in mind. They are tools that are easy to use and very precise so baby is sure to get a nice trim. Baby’s nails grow so quickly and they have a tendency to scratch themselves especially their beautiful little faces. So keeping their nails trim and clean is so important this set has everything you need which makes life so much easier.</li>
            <li> I primarily bought this set because of the scissors. The scissors alone were almost the same price as this set. The scissors are great - nice and sharp for cutting those baby nails but also rounded at the tip so they don&#x27;t hurt the baby. My 10 month old LOVES to hold the nail file which has a teddy bear pattern. I was very disappointed in the quality of the clippers. They make a squeaky noise everytime you move them. They&#x27;re made of a hard plastic that feels rather cheap. I also have another pair of clippers and prefer them (The First Years American Red Cross Deluxe Nail Clipper with Magnifier). I never use the magnifier but the quality of the clippers seems much better.</li>
            <li> I love love love the scissors! I purchased the set because its cheaper than getting just the scissors. I purchased a set for my daughter when she was born, 4 years ago. I still have the scissors and they are still sharp. Recently i ordered another set to keep one upstairs and one downstairs. using scissors is SO much easier to cut tiny nails. I thought it might be a little bit tricker, but not at all. I will never use a nail cutter to cut my kids nails!</li>
            <li> Bought for use by my daughter for the new baby and they are happy with the product.</li>
            <li> I have an 8 month old, and I have been \\&quot;filing\\&quot; her nails exclusively until now.  Filing is in quotes because it works for 20 minutes. She scratches us, she scratches herself. Nail clippers are loud, less controlled and intimidating, but I like that the kit comes with one, so that once I build confidence/ my baby is a little older, it may be quicker... who knows?  The reviews for the scissor are great, and I would get the kit just because each part is useful and the price difference is small.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not been able to use the scissors while my daughter is awake, but when shes napping, its silent, well controlled (no nipping her!) and easy!  It is also satisfying as heck to see those claws come off!  I think a file is useful still to dull the nail and any points made by imperfect cuts, but its minimal use and easy enough to do that when baby is up.  I will update when we graduate to nail clipper!  This scissor is awesome!</li>
            <li> If you are not familiar with Tweezerman, then let the quality speak for itself.  This company started up in 1980 and later got acquired by J.A. Henkel (that german twins knives).  I made a huge mistake on buying the cheapie version and got grief from my wife because that one fell apart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This kit has it all and well worth it.  You will need the nail scissor for infants since their nails are delicate like cutting paper.  Save yourself the hassle and spend a little more for a quality product.</li>
            <li> Works perfectly but looks poorly finished</li>
