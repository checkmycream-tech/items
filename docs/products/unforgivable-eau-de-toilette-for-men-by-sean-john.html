            <li> I searched high and low for this cologne, but apparently the stores don&#x27;t carry it anymore. I thought it was discontinued. Took a chance by purchasing online. Will order 3 more to have on-hand, just in case.</li>
            <li> The best cologne excelent!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I have been using it for years, excellent choice.</li>
            <li> Im very happy n satisfied with my order n very thankful.  I kept trying to buy from other sellers n was very frustrated because my orders kept getting canceled due to seller price error.  WhicH delayed my order. So thank you.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed in this. This doesn&#x27;t smell anything like the ones I&#x27;ve bought before. The name on the bottle is peeling off. It makes me think this is just being sold as Sean John but is really something else at a higher price.</li>
            <li> I couldnt find this in stores and my wife does not want me to switch so I am glad I found this on Amazon.</li>
            <li> It may not smell as real or the smell may not last as the one I used to buy at Macy&#x27;s, but it still smell good.... I just love that Cologne.</li>
            <li> The item is superb!!!</li>
            <li> Great.....enough said</li>
            <li> Order this for my son for Christmas every yr, he loves it</li>
            <li> Bought this for my dad for Christmas because they don&#x27;t sell in stores anymore, he said this is the real deal.</li>
            <li> I wish they still had this in the stores, my husband was trilled that we could find it on this site the only let down was that it doesn&#x27;t last as long.&lt;br /&gt;Still smells wonderful !!!!</li>
            <li> Product arrived quickly and was as described</li>
            <li> Its not the actually what you think it is. Bottle doesn&#x27;t even have any other markings, no box and came in bubble wrap unlike the original one you would buy at a department store. Smells something like the original but it is what it is for the price.</li>
            <li> Smells like sex. Like hot sex. If you buy this for your husband expect to be sexin it up. Realize this product is not intended for young children as it causes sex. Lots of gotta have it sex</li>
            <li> My all-time favorite scent at a GREAT price!</li>
            <li> I love this cologne is the best I&#x27;ve been using it for years so is great</li>
            <li> The smell isn&#x27;t bad but this has no staying power. You spray it on your wrist and you really can&#x27;t smell it an hour later.  There is no way I&#x27;d buy this again.  You can&#x27;t be paying that kind of money for a cologne that is gone after an hour.</li>
            <li> This is one of my husband&#x27;s favorites. We cannot find it anywhere! So I ordered it from here for him as a gift for our wedding. He loves it and so do I! And to top it off the scent lasts all day! I would definitely recommend this cologne to everyone!! I will definitely be purchasing it again!!</li>
            <li> Let me tell you, this cologne has captured my hubby like no other. He started using it in 2009 and cannot stop ever since….I think when he stopped seeing it at Macy&#x27;s on his trips, he was heartbroken. So please continue to supply online. He turned to Tom Ford, but he had to come back to Unforgivable and I forgave him, hahaha. The scent is sexy and alluring and no one quite knows what you have on, so add mysterious to the description. Mind you, he was a CK and Tommy die-hearted fan but when he found Unforgivable, he was bound by its tantalizing smell, one that I found on him to be seductively appealing.</li>
            <li> I definitely happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I received the item without any problems.</li>
            <li> Love thissssssss maaaaaaaan. I&#x27;ve been wearing this cologne since the day it launched. I&#x27;ve been told I smell like sex on a stick;)</li>
