            <li>Favorite eyebrows pencil.</li>
            <li>wasn&#x27;t  sure -</li>
            <li>like  many  of  women</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Jumped on Amazon and was so glad to see it offered.  </li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t ever go back to drug store brand, Anastasia is the best!</li>
            <li>great ,creates natural looking brow, easy to apply, stays on,thin pencil makes it easy to get the shape you desire!</li>
            <li>I read reviews stating that this pencil would look good for people with fair skin and red hair.</li>
            <li>Its perfect; three stars only because it finish quickly.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply and stays put.</li>
            <li>Any mistakes are easy to repair, and it&#x27;s build-able after I get the outline I want.  </li>
            <li>This pencil broke much faster and seemed kind of &amp;#34;weak&amp;#34; compared to the Sephora one.&lt;br</li>
            <li>light  </li>
            <li>The brow wiz is really good to drawing the eyebrow and give it a natural look.</li>
            <li>This is a great product which works better than the other 3 brow shading products I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>It lasted me a bit over a month, but i&#x27;d sometimes apply it more than once a day (with how hot this summer has been</li>
            <li>It is perfect for filling in small parts of your brow.  </li>
            <li>The mascara-like brush on the opposite end is nice for feathering out the lines and making them look even more natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Considering the price point, I am hopeful there is something equally good which will last longer.</li>
            <li>However, I have not found any pencil I like better and so except for the price I really like it.</li>
            <li>This is, by far, my favorite eyebrow pencil ever.</li>
            <li>It looks natural and I selected the appropriate shade for my skin/hair tones.</li>
            <li>but  rather  rare</li>
            <li>but when I use this I have thick gorgeous Brows!</li>
            <li>and  was  right  </li>
            <li>and I seem to go through the pencil rather quickly and find myself ordering them more regularly than I had hoped.  </li>
            <li>Best eyebrow pencil and lasts forever, second time buying it, first pencil lasted 8 months with almost everyday use.</li>
            <li>I will probably go to Sephora and buy my next one because I&#x27;m sure it broke during shipping.</li>
            <li>I know this is really more about user error, but taking that into consideration with future iterations of the packaging design might be nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It arrived  exactly when it was supposed to.</li>
            <li>I am something of a newbie at brow fillers, so I don&#x27;t use it frequently but the Anastasia Brow Wiz seemed to run out quickly.</li>
            <li>but, to me, 2 months is acceptable for such a fantastic product.</li>
            <li>The pencil works well, but as I have stated feels very fragile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really like this brow pencil.  </li>
            <li>It is much cheaper on Amazon than anywhere else I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li>Just use short, light swipes when applying.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>A plus when most other brow pencils are basically just eyeliners in brow pencil packaging.</li>
            <li>The pencil is very, very thin which allows for a fine and much more natural-looking line.</li>
            <li>Love this Brow Wiz pencil usually..</li>
            <li>No other eyebrow pencil looks nearly as natural!!</li>
            <li>Way too soft and crayon-like.</li>
            <li>Not too soft, not waxy.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I wear the blonde dipbrow and use the caramel to make straight lines.  </li>
            <li>Natural looking and not oily.</li>
            <li>Very easy to apply &amp; pencil is thin which I love, avoiding those unnatural looking, thick lines.  </li>
            <li>Worth the price, although it does not last an extremely long time.</li>
            <li>No real serious complaints outside of the wear.</li>
            <li>I have tried other Abastasia products and was very satisfied,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a very slim eyebrow pencil, with the pencil on one end and an eyebrow brush in the other side.</li>
            <li>I like it because I don&#x27;t have to use much to fill in the small areas I need to and it takes less than 30 seconds to put it on, then finish off with a light brush (which is on the opposite end of the pencil).</li>
            <li>As much as I like it, I can only give it 3 stars because there is so little of the product included.</li>

            <li> I have been able to use it because I just keep sticking the little pieces back in when they fall out, but for $20 I&#x27;m disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I saw this on a YouTube vlog the other day and my interest was piqued.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have level 7 dark blonde/light brown hair.</li>

            <li> I just wish the price would be cut in at least half.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t smudge on me, and I have oily skin which is usually a problem.</li>
            <li> First off, I have only purchased brow pencils when I couldn&#x27;t find powder and they have always been horrible.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what can be done about that.</li>
            <li> I was a little nervous when I saw how thin the pencil was, but once i tried it I was hooked.</li>
            <li> and  thick  </li>
            <li> (sad face)</li>

            <li> I love this stuff!  No other eyebrow pencil looks nearly as natural!!</li>
            <li> I love this product, I buy it all the time</li>
            <li> love this! very thin line, easy to apply. that being said, make sure to use a setting spray or it may come off by touching it. This is, by far, my favorite eyebrow pencil ever. Worth the price, although it does not last an extremely long time. I bought mine on Feb 23rd and just bought another on April 26th - but, to me, 2 months is acceptable for such a fantastic product.</li>
            <li> I was a little nervous when I saw how thin the pencil was, but once i tried it I was hooked. It enables me to fill in my sparse brows and they look very good since the pencil is made this way. It didn&#x27;t smudge on me, and I have oily skin which is usually a problem. The price is definitely worth it!!!</li>
            <li> I plucked on my eyebrows off when I was 16 I wanted to look like Pamela Anderson Ha ha ha so this pencil does miracles when it comes to giving you eyebrows! I literally have none but when I use this I have thick gorgeous Brows!</li>
            <li> Not a fan of this eyebrow pencil. I have been using IT eyebrow pencil, and a friend recommended Anastasia. I have tried other Abastasia products and was very satisfied,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a very slim eyebrow pencil, with the pencil on one end and an eyebrow brush in the other side. In fact the pencil feels fragile in my hands. I wondered if I bore down too hard if the pencil would break. The color, caramel, was good for me, and looked goid. My issues are the fragility of the pencil,mand the price. I can purchase two eyebrow pencils of IT for the price of Anastasia. The pencil works well, but as I have stated feels very fragile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not Recommended For Me. prisrob 06-26-15</li>
            <li> This brow pencil works perfectly. I read reviews stating that this pencil would look good for people with fair skin and red hair. This was not the case with me.</li>
            <li> Its perfect; three stars only because it finish quickly.</li>
            <li> This is a great product which works better than the other 3 brow shading products I&#x27;ve tried. I am something of a newbie at brow fillers, so I don&#x27;t use it frequently but the Anastasia Brow Wiz seemed to run out quickly. I like it because I don&#x27;t have to use much to fill in the small areas I need to and it takes less than 30 seconds to put it on, then finish off with a light brush (which is on the opposite end of the pencil). It looks natural and I selected the appropriate shade for my skin/hair tones. As much as I like it, I can only give it 3 stars because there is so little of the product included. Considering the price point, I am hopeful there is something equally good which will last longer. I will continue looking and reading reviews.</li>
            <li> I really like this brow pencil.  The color and brush are wonderful!!  However, the pencil part was broken in a ton of tiny pieces when I opened it.  I have been able to use it because I just keep sticking the little pieces back in when they fall out, but for $20 I&#x27;m disappointed.  I will probably go to Sephora and buy my next one because I&#x27;m sure it broke during shipping.</li>
            <li> Love this eyebrow pencil. Arrived in perfect condition</li>
            <li> I love this brow pencil! I was at my local Sephora and one of the girls there put it on me and I&#x27;ve been in love with it ever since. It is the easiest brow pencil I have ever used. The color blends very nice. It is much cheaper on Amazon than anywhere else I&#x27;ve found. The Anastasia brow gel is also nice. It lasts for a long time. If you buy this pencil I recommend purchasing the brow gel, too. Love this product!!!</li>
            <li> I use this eye brow pencil all the time!</li>
            <li> I loooove using this. After receiving this product there wasn&#x27;t a day that went by where I wouldn&#x27;t apply this. Best brow pencil i&#x27;ve ever used. It lasted me a bit over a month, but i&#x27;d sometimes apply it more than once a day (with how hot this summer has been I felt like my makeup was melting off my face). I just wish the price would be cut in at least half. Definitely going to be a regular purchase.</li>
            <li> this is a reorder... I have blond eyebrows... this works better than anything I&#x27;ve tried.....  will keep using it....</li>
            <li> Best brow pencil ever!!!</li>
            <li> First off, I have only purchased brow pencils when I couldn&#x27;t find powder and they have always been horrible. They look like a child used a low-grade crayon on my face. I&#x27;ve always been a powder girl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I saw this on a YouTube vlog the other day and my interest was piqued.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;- The pencil is very, very thin which allows for a fine and much more natural-looking line. Just use short, light swipes when applying.&lt;br /&gt;- The pencil is also fairly hard, not too soft. A plus when most other brow pencils are basically just eyeliners in brow pencil packaging. Way too soft and crayon-like. The Anastasia Brow Wiz is perfect. Not too soft, not waxy.&lt;br /&gt;- I have auburn hair and got the light brunette pencil, which pleasantly matched my brows perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;- The mascara-like brush on the opposite end is nice for feathering out the lines and making them look even more natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS&lt;br /&gt;- I was disappointed with the length of wear. I expected it to last through the workday, but when I got home I barely had any left on. That&#x27;s a bummer. I expect to touch up my lipstick, but not brow pencil.&lt;br /&gt;- The cap for the pencil side is long and the cap for the brush side is short. This is only a problem if you get them mixed up and try to put the short cap on the pencil, which will smash and break your $20 brow pencil. (sad face) I know this is really more about user error, but taking that into consideration with future iterations of the packaging design might be nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It arrived quick, packaging was great. No real serious complaints outside of the wear. I&#x27;m not sure what can be done about that.</li>
            <li> I have level 7 dark blonde/light brown hair. This pencil looks great. I like it better than the Anastasia Dip Brow.</li>
            <li> Love this!  It&#x27;s very easy to apply and is a great color.</li>
            <li> Quality and color is perfect! It arrived  exactly when it was supposed to.</li>
            <li> great ,creates natural looking brow, easy to apply, stays on,thin pencil makes it easy to get the shape you desire!</li>
            <li> What my brows have been waiting for</li>
            <li> I buy this pencil all the time because it is a great color and it applies so well.  However, it is a bit on the pricey side and I seem to go through the pencil rather quickly and find myself ordering them more regularly than I had hoped.  However, I have not found any pencil I like better and so except for the price I really like it.</li>
            <li> The brow wiz is really good to drawing the eyebrow and give it a natural look. Totally recommend purchasing this item and anything from Anastasia Beverly Hills their makeup line is amazing.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It is perfect for filling in small parts of your brow.  I wear the blonde dipbrow and use the caramel to make straight lines.  Works perfectly.</li>
            <li> like this product - repeat customer</li>
            <li> Love this Brow Wiz pencil usually.. Fills in my eyebrows just great.&lt;br /&gt;I usually buy from Sephora but my older one reached its life span so I decided to buy from Amazon to avoid stores. This pencil broke much faster and seemed kind of &amp;#34;weak&amp;#34; compared to the Sephora one.&lt;br /&gt;Maybe it was a one time thing, but next I&#x27;m just going to have to go the mall.</li>
            <li> Favorite eyebrows pencil. Natural looking and not oily. Used to buy it at sephora but online is faster for me. Carmel is perfect color for my light/medium brown hair.</li>
            <li> My daughter was happy with this.</li>
            <li> I have  naturall  dark  brown  hair  and  practically  black  brows. I  have  been  dying  my  hair  for  years  in  red/auburn  colour  with  gold  undertone - and  dying  my  brows  too  in  some  kind  of  the  same  colour. I  have  very  long  and  thick  hair  in  my  brows  but  rather  rare - that&#x27;s  way  I  need  to  fill  somehow  this  gaps  and  also  to  correct  the  form  of  my  brows.&lt;br /&gt;I  wasn&#x27;t  sure - what  colour  should  I  order  - Auburn  or  Caramel  because  I  was  afraid  that  Caramel  whould  be  too  light  fot  my  brows. I  chose  Caramel  and  was  right  becouse  Auburn  is  too  dark. The  fact  is  that  I  don&#x27;t  want  to  make  my  brows  darker  like  many  of  women (it&#x27;s  not  suit  for  my  face)  but  I  need  only  to  make  them  brighter  and  fill  the  gaps.</li>
            <li> Love this brow pencil! Very easy to apply &amp; pencil is thin which I love, avoiding those unnatural looking, thick lines.  Great color match as I have light brown hair. Recommend!</li>
            <li> Love it. Perfect. Easy to apply and stays put.</li>
            <li> This brow company is the best.  Everything is good from them.</li>
            <li> I had purchased this product previously.  When I went to purchase another, they did not have the color I needed.  Jumped on Amazon and was so glad to see it offered.  I like the built in brush on the end to soften the strokes made with the pencil.  I have blonde eyebrows, so color is definitely needed.</li>
            <li> Best eyebrow pencil and lasts forever, second time buying it, first pencil lasted 8 months with almost everyday use. Color is perfect and the brush on the end makes it easy to apply and blend. I won&#x27;t ever go back to drug store brand, Anastasia is the best!</li>
            <li> The best brows I&#x27;ve ever had!  This is fool proof.  Any mistakes are easy to repair, and it&#x27;s build-able after I get the outline I want.  Also long wearing on a normal day, but does not survive a hard workout.</li>
