            <li>And the smell is too strong.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s warm and comforting, but not so much that I want to use these every day.  </li>
            <li>the cost isn&#x27;t much and you may end up loving the product.</li>
            <li>I found it relaxing and really like the rose scent.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I paid 15.99 for 14 masks with free prime shipping.  </li>
            <li>It is one of my two favorite &#x27;scents&#x27; the other being the mens version which is a menthol and great for helping your sinuses not feel all stuffy.</li>
            <li>He suggest using hot compresses more than twice a day, if at all possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a single mom, working a stressful full time job, own my own business, renovating a house, etc.</li>
            <li>These pads are great because they stay warm at least 15 minutes, or longer, and you can use them at work without fear of messing up your makeup or hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Overall for the price this is a good product.  </li>
            <li>I am very satisfied with the product, especially its scent.</li>
            <li>/&gt; Very much!</li>
            <li>This product is absolutely Amazing, it has the right amount of heat on your tired eyes and the smell of the rose water is divine!</li>
            <li>Worth of buying.</li>
            <li>If you feel tired, this eye mask is perfect for relaxing!!!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I peeled the ear wraps back and  rubbed the eye pads a bit to activate it so that it would warm up.  </li>
            <li>I have used this product for a few years, I love it, it always makes me relax and comfortable and easy to fall asleep.</li>
            <li>Nice product for people working for a long time.</li>
            <li>Would definitely buy again :)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d love to know if the heat is produced from exposure to air or by squeezing and moving the contents of the eye patches around, but since I couldn&#x27;t read the instructions in Japanese, I have no idea</li>
            <li>If you love pampering yourself and lying or reclining quietly for 10 or 15 minutes, then go for it -</li>
            <li>Honestly, at first glance I was like, &amp;#34;yeah...waste of $$$...&amp;#34; Then I put it on and went to bed to prepare to sleep for the night.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soft and comfortable while wearing.</li>
            <li>I would rather to use the hot towel.</li>
            <li>&#x27;s the thing, hot compresses are messy, and I have yet to find a way to keep them warm for a full 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>It can effectively dilute the dark circles and bags under the eyes!</li>
            <li>Heats really well.</li>
            <li>Very calming and relax.</li>
            <li>I saw a picture where the mask pulls apart in the back and the holes fit over your ears; else, I would not have known how to wear it.</li>
            <li>very relaxing if applied</li>
            <li>Could work wonderfully for a cold.</li>
            <li>It does work very well.</li>
            <li>REAL BUYER REVIEW:&lt;br /&gt;At</li>
            <li>I am a real buyer not someone posting here because they are paid to by acompany.  </li>
            <li>Eyes are wet and comfortable.</li>
            <li>The rose fragrance is subtle and soothing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used them once; so, I cannot attest to the consistency of each eye pad, but the one I used produces a moist heat - not too hot, but definately hot enough to serve the purpose of heating the oil in your eyelids.</li>
            <li>First, there are no English instruction.</li>
            <li>Heats up nicely (not too hot for me) and comfortable, i can eaily fall asleep with it on.</li>
            <li>A real reviewer will give a wide range of stars on reviews to help real buyers.  </li>
            <li>Its material is soft, and helpful for sleep.</li>
            <li>The eye mask will become warm after you take it out from a little pack, but it wont last very long, doesn&#x27;t make me sleepy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty simple, just open and use immediately.</li>
            <li>It only works a short time, doesn&#x27;t help much.</li>
            <li>They arrived in a pretty pink box and upon opening were individual packets inside</li>
            <li>I mean, it doesn&#x27;t cost very much and it was worth the little bit of comfort that it gives my friend.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The reason for the 4 star and not 5 star rating is because I&#x27;m still not sure I used them the right way as all the instructions are in Japanese.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I LOVE this rose scent, its so light and pleasant smelling, not heavy at all and so relaxing and soothing as it warms. It is one of my two favorite &#x27;scents&#x27; the other being the mens version which is a menthol and great for helping your sinuses not feel all stuffy.</li>
            <li> Nice product, will order again</li>
            <li> Love this product. The rose fragrance is subtle and soothing. Even my husband likes to use them before bed time.</li>
            <li> I love it. The eye pad gets really warm. The rose smell is really strong. A bit too strong for my liking. But It&#x27;s not an unpleasant smell so it&#x27;s okay. I&#x27;ve ordered the lavender one before and I don&#x27;t know if it was a defect or if those ones just are like that but it had almost no smell. I like lavender... Anyway. The rose one has a strong smell. Heats really well. Very comfortable on my face. Would definitely buy again :)</li>
            <li> Works just how it says it does. Heats up nicely (not too hot for me) and comfortable, i can eaily fall asleep with it on. smell is great. Makes me feel like im at the spa!</li>
            <li> Ocassionally, I get dry eyes during the night, so in the morning one or both of my eyes are stinging.  To remedy the sting, I place a warm face towel over my eyes.  The downside to this is the face towel get cold in about 2 minutes.  So instead of 15 minute to remedy the pain, it was taking me 30 minutes.  One day a friend of mine gave me two packet of this eye mask. I was so happy when I discover that this amazing eye mask becomes warm as soon as you take if off the packet and stay warm for about 20 minutes.  No more wet towel over my eyes.  What a great product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve slept so much better since I started to use them every night!</li>
            <li> I like that. It&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> Not as good as my reusable one, but great for travel.</li>
            <li> My friend recommended this product to me long time ago. Till recently, I bought it and tried it myself. I am very satisfied with the product, especially its scent. Very calming and relax. Will try the lavender scent after I use us this pack.</li>
            <li> Do not buy this product.  It is useless.  It is just made of paper.  It is just a piece of junk.</li>
            <li> I have dry eyes, Blepharitis, and my Meiobian Glands ocassionally get blocked, causing inflammed and swollen eyelids. My opthalmologist said I should use hot compresses on my eyes at least 2 times a day for at least 10 minutes each time. He suggest using hot compresses more than twice a day, if at all possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s the thing, hot compresses are messy, and I have yet to find a way to keep them warm for a full 10 minutes. They ruin your makeup, your hair, and leave soaked spots on your clothes, your pillow, your furniture - wherever you sit or lay while using them. These pads are great because they stay warm at least 15 minutes, or longer, and you can use them at work without fear of messing up your makeup or hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased the &amp;#34;rose&amp;#34; scented ones, and received them today. I&#x27;ve only used them once; so, I cannot attest to the consistency of each eye pad, but the one I used produces a moist heat - not too hot, but definately hot enough to serve the purpose of heating the oil in your eyelids. It left my eyes feeling refreshed and comforted. I will definately be using these pads more than twice a day, and will probably leave one one at bedtime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason for the 4 star and not 5 star rating is because I&#x27;m still not sure I used them the right way as all the instructions are in Japanese. Also, if you have a large head and/or your eyes are set far apart, this mask may not fit well over your eyes and/or may feel too tight. I have a petite face, and the mask fit perfectly over my eyes and the fit was snug. I saw a picture where the mask pulls apart in the back and the holes fit over your ears; else, I would not have known how to wear it. I&#x27;d love to know if the heat is produced from exposure to air or by squeezing and moving the contents of the eye patches around, but since I couldn&#x27;t read the instructions in Japanese, I have no idea if I got the maximum heating results, or if I could have used it for longer than 15 minutes by just taking it off and shaking/squeezing the eye pads to reactivate the heat. Thus, the 4 star review.</li>
            <li> I love the steam warm eye mask. but this one is different from what I bought in a local japanese store. And the smell is too strong. What the hell！</li>
            <li> mmm... I don&#x27;t feel the steam when use it.</li>
            <li> cant wait to open it and end up waste it! dont open the pack unless you really going to use it... :(</li>
            <li> These do what they say they will, which is to warm and steam your eye area for about 10-15 minutes.  They smell nice, with the scent not being too strong or obnoxious.  I will say this: after using it, I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s something I&#x27;ll repurchase.  It&#x27;s warm and comforting, but not so much that I want to use these every day.  In fact, I used one eye mask, and then forgot about them for about a week.  My daughter tried a mask at the same time I did, and after about a minute just asked me if she could take it off.  If you love pampering yourself and lying or reclining quietly for 10 or 15 minutes, then go for it - the cost isn&#x27;t much and you may end up loving the product.</li>
            <li> I use the mask at night, the heat and rose smell make eyes relaxed.  This product works well.  The only thing I&#x27;d like to suggest is to attach an English instruction with the shipment.</li>
            <li> When I receive the package, it was already been opened. It probably is some knock off products... It doesn&#x27;t stay on the eyes, and it is not very warm either. The good thing is they smell nice. will not purchase again.</li>
            <li> very relaxing if applied</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the second time I buy this product. I&#x27;m always sleepless if I have long working day. My friend recommended me use this. It makes me feel rest, and I can have deep sleep when I use it at night.  It can effectively dilute the dark circles and bags under the eyes!</li>
            <li> The product is good and it will be even better if the contour shape is against the shape of eyes.</li>
            <li> it heats and is perfect for a headache, sleep, relaxation aromatherapy etc. I have sinusitis and I use this to sleep and loosen the mucus. Could work wonderfully for a cold. It also treats the eyes and it releases the benefits of the herbs, in this case rose, with heat. I noticed my eyes less puffy with regular use. Once a week.</li>
            <li> I have bought this product for several times. Its material is soft, and helpful for sleep. nice scent and warm eyes comfortably.</li>
            <li> love the scene! if it can work longer that will be wonderful!!!!</li>
            <li> Theses are Great, I slept so well after using this mask, really dose melt away the tension and stress in around the eye area!!  Sure to buy many, many more, and the rose scent is very relaxing as well!!  great product!!</li>
            <li> These feel really good and I love the scent.  I don&#x27;t know how much good they do in terms of soothing my eyes, but they do make me lie still for 10 minutes and relax, and I enjoy the experience.</li>
            <li> I melt back to sleep! Are these the rose ones? Ew! Buy unscented! It&#x27;s an cheap rose smell, like that grandma soap stuff. Too bad they look like a maxi pad. They would be great on airplanes- just take an eye sleeper mask, lol!</li>
            <li> The rose scent is lovely. Instructions in Japanese/Chinese characters, so I can read it. It&#x27;s pretty simple, just open and use immediately. It will warm up when exposed to the air. It says to keep on for 10 minutes which is about the amount of the time the heat is active for. After that, you do feel the heat start to fade away. I found it relaxing and really like the rose scent. I don&#x27;t know what the lavender scent is like, but I would buy the rose one again.</li>
            <li> This product is absolutely Amazing, it has the right amount of heat on your tired eyes and the smell of the rose water is divine! InLove it!</li>
            <li> the eye mask helped me to sleep better. When I use it before I sleep,  my sleep quality increases. I recommend this.</li>
            <li> I ordered a rose masks but received lemon masks. I don&#x27;t like the smell of lemon.</li>
            <li> Love love love this product!!!</li>
            <li> I just love it... Help me relax and I love the spa feeling</li>
            <li> I bought this for a friend of mine who has trouble sleeping and she found that it is helping out a bit. I mean, it doesn&#x27;t cost very much and it was worth the little bit of comfort that it gives my friend.</li>
            <li> Feels good but I don&#x27;t like the smell. Also it sometimes burns a little</li>
            <li> I love this eyes mask once I use it. The warmth feels comfortable and smelling so good~It will be good to have it during the nap</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a few years, I love it, it always makes me relax and comfortable and easy to fall asleep.</li>
            <li> Each mask is individually wrapped (convenient for travel). It activates when you open the package and can feel it working in about a minute or less. The scent is pleasant in my opinion, but if you don&#x27;t like fragrance or it triggers your allergies or migraines, look for the non-scented variety. Honestly, at first glance I was like, &amp;#34;yeah...waste of $$$...&amp;#34; Then I put it on and went to bed to prepare to sleep for the night. It was wonderful! I didn&#x27;t realize how much tension I was holding in my eyes until this silly little sent from heaven mask went to work. I&#x27;ve been using one every night since I tried it and ordered more so I don&#x27;t run out. I also ordered a couple of the other fragrances (all except the lavender due to allergy). I&#x27;m a single mom, working a stressful full time job, own my own business, renovating a house, etc. etc. etc. Small indulgences really make a difference in my quality of life. This is one I&#x27;ll continue.</li>
            <li> Several months ago, I was not interested in this product since it&#x27;s dry and expensive. However, after trying it once, I felt in love with it. It&#x27;s soft and comfortable while wearing. After a minute, it start to heat. Eyes are wet and comfortable. Buying this on Amazon is 5 dollars cheaper than buying it in the Japanese market. Worth of buying.</li>
            <li> so comfy before i sleep!</li>
            <li> When u feel tired, this is definitely something that u need</li>
            <li> If you feel tired, this eye mask is perfect for relaxing!!!&lt;br /&gt;I specially like the Rose one!! it smells very good!!!</li>
            <li> First, there are no English instruction. It only works a short time, doesn&#x27;t help much. I don&#x27;t feel any differents before and after. I would rather to use the hot towel. This is expensive, just waste my money!</li>
            <li> It works! I unfolded the mask, put the white side of the mask on my eyes and hang the paper thing around my ears. It started warming my eyes with just the perfect heat and along with the scent of rose.... The only sad thing is that it lasts only for 10 min...</li>
            <li> My boy friend loves it madly. Nice product for people working for a long time. Wish it could be cheaper.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very good product with nice rose smell, makes my eyes feel refresh also before I use it I put thick layer of eyes cream then put eye mask on it&#x27;s reduce dark eye circle!</li>
            <li> good eye mask/&lt;br /&gt;Easy to use, smells good, and the temprature is also OK for me.&lt;br /&gt;After using , it makes me more easy to go to sleep.</li>
            <li> Disappointed. Basically its a hand warmer but for eyes. I can hardly notice the aroma which was my main motivation for purchase. Not that relaxing for e and I won&#x27;t buy again</li>
            <li> Smells soooooo good. It does work very well. The warm relaxing my eyes. I use once a week. I will buy more. But shopping took like a month. So I have to order it now before I run out. Very nice thing to buy.</li>
            <li> The eye mask will become warm after you take it out from a little pack, but it wont last very long, doesn&#x27;t make me sleepy.</li>
            <li> Good. I like it. I have used it before. Price is good too. I don&#x27;t know what else to say.</li>
            <li> Very nice feeling, but the scent is a bit too strong.</li>
            <li> like it&lt;br /&gt; Very much!</li>
            <li> Kind of pricy but it serves its purpose</li>
            <li> REAL BUYER REVIEW:&lt;br /&gt;At first I was highly doubtful about them afterall there is no english instructions.  They arrived in a pretty pink box and upon opening were individual packets inside (I love that).  After opening you get that rose smell which I just find divine.  I peeled the ear wraps back and  rubbed the eye pads a bit to activate it so that it would warm up.  Now you are not going to get the steam like what you see in the photos - but there is warmth and it is relaxing.  Overall for the price this is a good product.  I doubt if it will help with anti-aging or wrinkles but only time will tell with that.  I intend to use moisturing eye pads beneath this mask and sleep it in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I paid 15.99 for 14 masks with free prime shipping.  I would value the 14 masks at around 12 bucks and no more.  If you do not have Prime and cannot get them for less than 15 then keep shopping because there are a ton of listings just like this one and lots of sellers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;REAL REVIEW: I am a real buyer not someone posting here because they are paid to by acompany.  On products from overseas read the reviews then check on the reviewer&#x27;s name - if they have only posted 4 stars and above reviews than I do not consider them valid.  A real reviewer will give a wide range of stars on reviews to help real buyers.  The verified buyer is meaningless as well since reviewers are paid to purchase than review the product. Review the Reviewer.</li>
            <li> great！ it help me relax my eyes and make me sleep better~</li>
            <li> Perfect! And smell is so good.</li>
