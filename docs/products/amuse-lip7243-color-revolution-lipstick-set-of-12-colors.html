            <li> They are good, u have to rub the lipstick on a couple of times to really show the color. They come in a plastic box, and in general they all came in good shape, the 12 lipsticks work perfectly, except the baby pink, wich broke when i was trying it, but i put it back and pushed a little bit and works fine, they come with a sticker seal wich is good and all of them where new, they are not the best quality and are not very creamy but in general, for the price its a good product. It has good color selection. If u ask me would i buy it again? Yes.</li>
