    <ol>
            <li>/&gt;This would be a perfect gift from a man to a women that cares about her health.</li>
            <li>Best of all, this is the least-clumping mascara I have -ever- used!</li>
            <li>Great find!!</li>
            <li>This mascara went on great, and helped curl.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li>The application brush for this mascara is nice.</li>
            <li>but it still applies nicely and doesn&#x27;t flake.</li>
            <li>I had researched a lot for the mascara, and I found out many people were giving good reviews about this product, so I bought it and tried it out.</li>
            <li>I wanted to love this mascara -</li>
            <li>I love their Shimmer Strips eyeshadows.  </li>
            <li>This, we found, was the most bang for the buck.</li>
            <li>More water means more bacteria means more preservatives.</li>
            <li>you don&#x27;t wear glasses, it may work better for you.</li>
            <li>I love most Physician&#x27;s Formula products, but I can&#x27;t even use this one.</li>
            <li>I was very excited to get an organic mascara.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s all gluten-free, so as a celiac, I can wear their cosmetics without worry, and look pretty good doing it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Looks good at first but wears onto your face</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not disappointed!</li>
            <li>However, it&#x27;s clumpy, doesn&#x27;t build well, and runs easily.</li>
            <li>I was happy to discover natural mascara that was available at drugstores.</li>
            <li>No running and easy to remove (coconut oil or any makeup remover).</li>
            <li>It was good, but not as good as I expected.</li>
            <li>First thing I noticed upon opening was the nice, light smell.</li>
            <li>I was excited to get organic makeup and even more excited after reading the reviews.</li>
            <li>This mascara did not go on smoothly, it took close to 4 coats just to show up.  </li>
            <li>I love Physician&#x27;s Formula and generally buy most of what they sell in a year: I have their Natural Glow Foundation in Light, and love it.</li>
            <li>Thank order came quickly</li>
            <li>(I rarely have this problem with mascaras either).  </li>
            <li>I doesn&#x27;t really give me a good volume or good length, it doesn&#x27;t make my lashes any different, all it gave me was the organic smell and little particles on my lashes.</li>
            <li>Why, when marketing an organic mascara, would you go with a cheap, space age look that is bound to turn offthe type of person looking for natural cosmetics?</li>
            <li>Definitely on my permanent list of makeup necessities :)</li>
            <li>My wife, after much thought, has switched to this organic Mascara.</li>
            <li>The flip side of that is that this mascara runs readily with the slightest exposure to tears or rain.</li>
            <li>Personally, I&#x27;d rather buy mascara more frequently than deal with chemical</li>
            <li>Oher Organic Wear products come in nice, nature inspired packaging in tan and green featuring leaves, etc.</li>
            <li>I have highly sensitive eyes and have not been able to apply regular mascara.</li>
            <li>I find the complaints by other reviewers interesting.</li>
            <li>I was interested in Physician&#x27;s Formula mascara since it is natural and organic.</li>
            <li>Comes off with plain water, very easily.</li>
            <li>Seriously, dark smudges under my eyes, despite it looking fine when I first applied it.  </li>
            <li>I use their Super BB Cheek and Lip balms, daily.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this mascara.</li>
            <li>No clumping, very natural, full lashes with just 1-2 applications (even on my Asian lashes).</li>
            <li>This mascara coats well, but is not thick and voluminous.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that my eyelashes don&#x27;t get stiff or tacky with this product when it dries, and I have never had any flaking problems.</li>
            <li>I just switched to Physicians Formula from a high end line at a specialty store and I am pleasantly surprised!</li>
            <li>The ingredients that make mascara water resistant, voluminous, quick drying and long lasting are exactly the ingredients that are harmful to one&#x27;s health.</li>
            <li>I bought this product at my local ULTA for about $8 many months ago, and I haven&#x27;t wanted to use any other mascara since.</li>
            <li>First, I want to say that I like the PF brand and do use a couple of their mineral make-up products regularly.</li>
            <li>&gt; The curved brush is nice, it is not gloppy or clumpy, but it is difficult to maneuver due to the wacky, space age shape of the handle.</li>
            <li>We are always on a hunt to live our lives naturally without use of toxic materials.</li>
            <li>It has a natural, defined look.&lt;br /&gt;What</li>
            <li>Complete TRASH.</li>
            <li>As I have started to move towards organic beauty products, I naturally wanted to try this mascara.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a fan of PF products - but the mascara goes on clumpy and it&#x27;s not easy to smooth out.</li>
            <li>Yes, the mascara appears a bit &#x27;dry&#x27; when you first open it</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t know if this is a general problem.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still on the hunt for a nightwear &#x27;diva&#x27; mascara, but for daily, natural beauty I&#x27;ll be using this product until it&#x27;s discontinued.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is definitely worth the few drawbacks o treat your eyes with care.</li>
            <li>I wear glasses, and I guess my eyes are a bit more humid behind them.</li>
            <li>It is a great everyday mascara, although not quite dramatic enough for a night out.</li>
            <li>One time my kid even looked at me shocked saying, &amp;#34;what happened, mommy?&amp;#34; I had more raccoon eyes even after wiping off the smudge the first time!</li>
            <li>My daughter&#x27;s thought I had was wearing fake lashes because my own lashes are short and stubby.  </li>
            <li>However, being able to remove it with plain water will likely help my lashes to be less damaged than having to use soap, chemical removers, or scrubbing to remove it.</li>
            <li>Even without crying, sweating, high humidity, etc, I get raccoon eyes by early afternoon.</li>

            <li> I usually like this brands mascaras, but this one really didn&#x27;t do it for me.</li>
            <li> It is cheap and silly looking enough to be embarassing.</li>
            <li> I had really high hopes for this product and was excited to try a really natural mascara without all the crap in it.  </li>
            <li> It does not provide a dramatic volume boost, but it seems to really curl and isolate my lashes for a natural every-day look.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it happened to be the one I received, but it was completely dry.</li>
            <li> It is getting a bit dry now, and I am now using it on my brows now.</li>
            <li> My mascara isn&#x27;t too dry, but isn&#x27;t extremely wet either.</li>
            <li> Not only did it not elongate and thicken my lashes, it smeared and I looked like a football player with the black streaks under the eyes.</li>
            <li> What it does do is leave big black smudges under your eyes.</li>
            <li> This mascara is very dry.</li>
            <li> For 3 years I have not worn eye makeup due to allergies.  </li>
            <li> As though I don&#x27;t already have dark circles under my eyes, now I have mascara making a dark mess under my eyes too?  </li>
            <li> I would look in a mirror and it looked like I had 2 black</li>
            <li> Within a few hours of application, It flaked off and powdered BLACK under my eyes.  </li>
            <li> Lastly the brush itself was uncomfortable to use; it was hard and actually hurt my eyes/lashes when I applied it.  </li>
            <li> Its not too expensive for something as natural as they advertise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I stop using this mascara after just a few days.  </li>
            <li> It dries without feeling hardened, but because of the lack of glue-like chemicals, it does not feel hard the way typical mascara does.</li>
            <li> No more itching and burning eyelids.  </li>
            <li> No more trips to the eye doctor for meds to relieve the pain and sores on my eyelids.  </li>
            <li> It smudged like crazy and left black everywhere even after hours of applying.</li>
            <li> Also, I am concerned about dangerous chemicals such as PPD.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> Not only is it jarring to look at, the ridiculous curve of the handle makes application awkward, to say the least.</li>
            <li> And yes, ridiculous packaging AND wand.</li>
            <li> If you want a thick, false eyelash type look this mascara will probably not satisfy you.</li>
            <li> However, this product sucks!</li>
            <li> I am unable to use cosmetics containing parabens because they disrupt hormones and encourage the growth of my brain tumor.</li>
            <li> Some of the alternatives are outrageously expensive.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, we are so spoiled by harmful yet convenient ingredients that we put  our appearance before our health.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like is the silly packaging.</li>
            <li> Well, unfortunately, after two uses, this is going in the trash.</li>
            <li> But for me, unfortunately, it was a disappointment.</li>
            <li> Maybe I got a bad tube, but it also had a smell that I didn&#x27;t care for.</li>
            <li> Well, I was disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Hate it.  </li>

            <li> Thank order came quickly&lt;br /&gt;and this is what I need</li>
            <li> I wanted to love this mascara - I&#x27;m a fan of PF products - but the mascara goes on clumpy and it&#x27;s not easy to smooth out. Maybe I got a bad tube, but it also had a smell that I didn&#x27;t care for. I threw it away after a week&#x27;s testing.</li>
            <li> I became allergic to traditional mascara and had to stop using them, but found that Physicians Formula Organic Mascara solved my problem. No more itching and burning eyelids.  No more trips to the eye doctor for meds to relieve the pain and sores on my eyelids.  This mascara gives length and volume to my eye lashes.  My daughter&#x27;s thought I had was wearing fake lashes because my own lashes are short and stubby.  I highly recommend this mascara.</li>
            <li> I love Physician&#x27;s Formula and generally buy most of what they sell in a year: I have their Natural Glow Foundation in Light, and love it. I love their Shimmer Strips eyeshadows.  I use their Super BB Cheek and Lip balms, daily.  It&#x27;s all gluten-free, so as a celiac, I can wear their cosmetics without worry, and look pretty good doing it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I have not found a mascara in their line that stays on. This is no exception.  Racoon eyes within two hours.  Not recommended.</li>
            <li> My wife, after much thought, has switched to this organic Mascara. We are always on a hunt to live our lives naturally without use of toxic materials. This, we found, was the most bang for the buck. Its not too expensive for something as natural as they advertise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This would be a perfect gift from a man to a women that cares about her health.</li>
            <li> The application brush for this mascara is nice. However, it&#x27;s clumpy, doesn&#x27;t build well, and runs easily. I will not buy this again.</li>

I bought it at Walmart for under 10 bucks.&lt;br /&gt; First thing I noticed upon opening was the nice, light smell. This mascara is very dry. It is possible that the dryness is just the n ature of the product. More water means more bacteria means more preservatives.

Oher Organic Wear products come in nice, nature inspired packaging in tan and green featuring leaves, etc. Not only is it jarring to look at, the ridiculous curve of the handle makes application awkward, to say the least. I have dropped the wand on more than one occasion because it is difficult to maneuver.It is cheap and silly looking enough to be embarassing. Overall, I like this product for its healthful benefits. It is a great everyday mascara, although not quite dramatic enough for a night out. It is definitely worth the few drawbacks o treat your eyes with care.</li>

            <li> For 3 years I have not worn eye makeup due to allergies.  This allows me to again wear mascara and finish off my dressy, evening look.</li>
            <li> I wear glasses, and I guess my eyes are a bit more humid behind them. This mascara went on great, and helped curl.&lt;br /&gt;For me though, I was having to wipe off mascara under my eyes all day. I would look in a mirror and it looked like I had 2 black eyes.&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t wear glasses, it may work better for you.</li>
            <li> Hate it.  Seriously, dark smudges under my eyes, despite it looking fine when I first applied it.  Within a few hours of application, It flaked off and powdered BLACK under my eyes.  As though I don&#x27;t already have dark circles under my eyes, now I have mascara making a dark mess under my eyes too?  Complete TRASH.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t clump….goes on easy…comes off easy…doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes</li>
            <li> flaked off onto cheeks</li>
            <li> I was very excited to get an organic mascara. I have highly sensitive eyes and have not been able to apply regular mascara. I don&#x27;t know if it happened to be the one I received, but it was completely dry. There was nothing to apply. I didnt ask for another one so I don&#x27;t know if this is a general problem. But for me, unfortunately, it was a disappointment.</li>
            <li> I just switched to Physicians Formula from a high end line at a specialty store and I am pleasantly surprised! I am paying about 1/4 of what I used to pay and I am 4 times happier..  Great find!!</li>
            <li> First, I want to say that I like the PF brand and do use a couple of their mineral make-up products regularly. As I have started to move towards organic beauty products, I naturally wanted to try this mascara. Well, unfortunately, after two uses, this is going in the trash. Not only did it not elongate and thicken my lashes, it smeared and I looked like a football player with the black streaks under the eyes. I will be going back to my non-organic mascara that I have been using for years that does not have any of these issues until I find an organic mascara that does the trick. And yes, ridiculous packaging AND wand.</li>
            <li> I was interested in Physician&#x27;s Formula mascara since it is natural and organic. I&#x27;m not disappointed! No clumping, very natural, full lashes with just 1-2 applications (even on my Asian lashes). Yes, the mascara appears a bit &#x27;dry&#x27; when you first open it but it still applies nicely and doesn&#x27;t flake. No running and easy to remove (coconut oil or any makeup remover). Definitely on my permanent list of makeup necessities :)</li>
            <li> I usually like this brands mascaras, but this one really didn&#x27;t do it for me. I don&#x27;t like the curved brush, it still works. I just don&#x27;t feel I get enough mascara on.</li>
            <li> ... Or a prize fighter...,&lt;br /&gt;Bought this because it said it curled.  It doesn&#x27;t.  What it does do is leave big black smudges under your eyes.</li>
            <li> I had researched a lot for the mascara, and I found out many people were giving good reviews about this product, so I bought it and tried it out. It was good, but not as good as I expected. I doesn&#x27;t really give me a good volume or good length, it doesn&#x27;t make my lashes any different, all it gave me was the organic smell and little particles on my lashes. It is getting a bit dry now, and I am now using it on my brows now. I don&#x27;t think I am gonna purchase it again</li>
            <li> I was excited to get organic makeup and even more excited after reading the reviews. However, this product sucks! It smudged like crazy and left black everywhere even after hours of applying. One time my kid even looked at me shocked saying, &amp;#34;what happened, mommy?&amp;#34; I had more raccoon eyes even after wiping off the smudge the first time! I just threw this away.</li>
            <li> I had really high hopes for this product and was excited to try a really natural mascara without all the crap in it.  Well, I was disappointed.  This mascara did not go on smoothly, it took close to 4 coats just to show up.  Also the consistency was tacky and made my eyelashes stick together.  It also ran and flaked under my eyes within an hour or two of applying (I rarely have this problem with mascaras either).  Lastly the brush itself was uncomfortable to use; it was hard and actually hurt my eyes/lashes when I applied it.  I stop using this mascara after just a few days.  Not recommended.</li>
            <li> Runs! Even without crying, sweating, high humidity, etc, I get raccoon eyes by early afternoon. I love most Physician&#x27;s Formula products, but I can&#x27;t even use this one.</li>
