            <li> DON&#x27;T MESS WITH THE SCENT. I&#x27;ve been buying Nantucket Briar for about 20 years.  Not any more :(</li>
            <li> Love the fragrance and the lotion. I&#x27;ve use Crabtree and Evelyn products for years and find them all superb. I&#x27;d recommend this highly.</li>
            <li> This was a good experience - I got it in a reasonable period of time after purchasing it online and the lotion is wonderful....not greasy, rich and has a long lasting fresh scent.  Love this product!</li>
            <li> Purchased for my Grandmother love the smell :)</li>
            <li> This is my favorite of the Evelyn Crabtree.</li>
            <li> I am a fan of Nantucket Briar from Crabtree &amp; Evelyn and being able to order from amazon is very convenient.  It arrived on time and well packaged.</li>
            <li> I love the product, however, I did not see anything on the website that said that this product was shipping from Germany.  Even the receipt is in German.</li>
            <li> I have been buying this product for over 10 years from a local store, but the price was getting too high.  About a year ago I purchased a large bottle of this through Amazon, but the smell/odor of the product was week.  I decided to stick with this smaller size; the same size I purchased from the local store and I wasn&#x27;t disappointed in the quality. It is exactly right.</li>
            <li> Excellent, hands were sandpaper, now. They are pillow soft</li>
            <li> Love, love this scent.  Not brash or heavy.  Nice clean smell.  My very favorite!  I always ask for this on my Christmas Wish List.</li>
            <li> this is my most favorite scent so to have some to use on my arms every day makes me happy.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I have yet to receive this item which was ordered over a month ago. And I am down to the last few drops of product and practically scrapping the side of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has been a nightly and daily ritual for me to use these product after evry shower and bath. I love my lotions, gels, and powders. I don&#x27;t think I can go with out them. Please assist and forward my order. Thank you so much....</li>
            <li> Makes your skin super soft, and it smells delicious! the lotion is very creamy and you would think you were putting like body milk on your body! i love it!</li>
            <li> Cannot stand the smell. Maybe it&#x27;s just me. I gave it away.</li>
            <li> Great price for hard to find product</li>
            <li> They changed the scent of this. I loved this lotion and now its horrible. The first two days I wore this I thought I kept smelling mens underarm deodorant. Then when I was doing laundry I held my shirt up to my nose. ITS SMELLS LIKE  A MANS COLOGNE!!  I am so upset. I cant wear perfume. And I had worn this for years and had a lot of compliments. Now this crap gives me a headache and I smell like a man!!&lt;br /&gt;Why cant companies leave well enough alone? So, CE you have lost a customer.</li>
            <li> I have used this along with the cologne and powder for fifteen years, and I haven&#x27;t found any other  that I like.  I do like lavender, but it can be hard to get one with a true scent.</li>
            <li> In the past, I purchased this lotion in a local Crabtree &amp; Evelyn store. I loved the fragrance and the lotion itself.  Because of a recent surgery, I was house-bound for awhile. I needed some lotion and decided to order it through Amazon.com.&lt;br /&gt;The delivery was received on time, but the lotion did not have much fragrance - even smelled stale and flat, like it had been sitting on a warehouse shelf for a very long time.&lt;br /&gt;In the future I will purchase this lotion, but at a local store where I can test the product before purchasing it.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for listening.&lt;br /&gt;Ruth Oehler</li>
            <li> The fragrance was not what I was use to:( Not sure why? Almost diluted?</li>
            <li> I have loved this product for many years and am always extremely satisfied with it whenever I purchase it! Wonderfully subtle scent!</li>
            <li> I have used this product in the past.  Wonderful mild scent and the lotion leaves hands and body feeling soft and silky.  Order was received promptly and the product was in excellent condition.</li>
            <li> The more I buy this for my wife the more &amp;#34;special&amp;#34; favors I get from my wife!!! I.E. I get more time in the garage (alone), I get meatloaf again on Monday nights, I get an additional hour of TV with the remote in my hand!!! I love this goop probably more than she does!!!&lt;br /&gt;I can recommend this to any man who is in the dog house, or tried of sleeping on the couch ( I suggest over night shipping in this case).&lt;br /&gt;It has a pleasant odor to it, not over powering at all!!!</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t smell like the original. I didn&#x27;t care for it.</li>
            <li> I like the scent &amp; the quality of this product. It has a clean &amp; pleasant aroma &amp; doesn&#x27;t&lt;br /&gt;fade for quite a while.</li>
            <li> The Nantucket Briar scent in this body lotion as well as the eau de parfum or the hand cream&lt;br /&gt;is the greatest scent ever. when i wear this scent i have had people ask me what was i wearing.&lt;br /&gt;One genttlemen vendor in a resort i was at loved how this smelled and while he was fixing something&lt;br /&gt;for me he asked if i could stay there cause he loved the scent. it is a delicate scent, not overpowering,&lt;br /&gt;but you can smell it in a really nice way. when i put these items on after i shower i keep sniffing myself&lt;br /&gt;cause it just smells so delightful. if you have not tried this scent, you should because it is one of the best&lt;br /&gt;out there..</li>
            <li> Smells sooooooooooooooooooooooooooo good! I just Love itttt!</li>
            <li> I love this product. It smells so fresh, like clean sheets in the palest of summer mornings. IN LOVE! I totally recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Love the wonderful light, fresh feminine scent.  Love it so much I&#x27;m trying to make it last longer by applying it after applying my regular body lotion.  Nice product.</li>
            <li> The product itself is great! I love the smell and feel of this product. when I wear it to work, everyone comments on how great I smell. It&#x27;s a little expensive, so I can only wear it occassionally, but when I do, I have a great day.</li>
            <li> The smell is great and it lasts a long time. I get a lot of compliments on the fresh scent.</li>
            <li> But a little goes a long, long way-one of the other things I love about it. It lasts forever with me-- The scent is very strong in my opinon,and can be obtrusive if you use to much- I don&#x27;t find the scent sweet as much as a soapy clean smell from my childhood.. I am happy to find it on amazon as my local store has stopped carrying it..</li>
            <li> I have a roll-on version of this scent and it is not the easiest way to apply it.  I wasn&#x27;t sure I would like the lotion, but I really do!  I also saved money by ordering it through Amazon which is always a good thing.  This fragrance is more on the beach-seashore side. Nice for everyday.</li>
