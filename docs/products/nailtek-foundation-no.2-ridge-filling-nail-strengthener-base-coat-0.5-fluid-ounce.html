            <li>Great product.  </li>
            <li>Product worked great while letting my nails grow after taking acrylics off.</li>
            <li>I was happy with the long-lasting manicures and the ridge filling.</li>
            <li>Great product</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t tried a lot of others, but I&#x27;m happy with this one and will buy it again when I run out.</li>
            <li>Great product and can give good reviews for the seller as well.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for a good ridge filler for some time and didn&#x27;t want to spend a ton of money.  </li>
            <li>and you&#x27;re good to go.  </li>
            <li>Good brush.</li>
            <li>I bought this and it completely filled the ridges in and nail polish glides on perfectly now!</li>
            <li>I loved how my hands looked with them.</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>Does a good job of filling ridges for a smoother finish.</li>
            <li>It also dries quickly to a matte finish, so it&#x27;s undetecable, perfect for men who want groomed nails without the shine.  </li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this product.  </li>
            <li>Very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>My toenails are happy campers :) Looking forward to seeing how it does on my fingernails.</li>
            <li>and I was able to fool people into thinking they were acrylics!</li>
            <li>To fix that problem, I use a coat of OPI Nail Envy underneath, then put on the Nailtek No. 2 foundation, put on polish and then use another coat of the OPI Nail Envy as a top coat and it works like a charm!</li>
            <li>and it works beautifully, goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>my nails are stronger because of the foundation 2 and it is amazing.</li>
            <li>This foundation 2 is amazing</li>
            <li>AMAZING just what i wanted</li>
            <li>Facilitates the ability to grow your own nails.</li>
            <li>weren&#x27;t looking as nice as they used to.</li>
            <li>My length was nice</li>
            <li>It leaves that perfect matte finish that you want before applying the polish, which makes the polish apply on much smoother and cleaner.</li>
            <li>The foundation 2 you can wear on its own</li>
            <li>/&gt;It gives a very nice, smooth surface to work on.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been a nail biter for years and this stuff is strong and a good deterrent to bite.</li>
            <li>and this is a great product the first time!</li>
            <li>So I guess I have to use it more often to see any kind of results because I haven&#x27;t seen it yet.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t comment on the claim of stronger nails, but so far I&#x27;m very happy with this product.</li>
            <li>It makes my nails nice and smooth and my nail polish seems to glide on nicely after using it.</li>
            <li>but I received it quickly and the bottle was in good shape so that is what matters to me.</li>
            <li>I used to never have my own nails that were strong.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>I love this product and it does work</li>
            <li>and then my colored polish on top.</li>
            <li>giltter don&#x27;t put a top coat of Nailtek</li>
            <li>AGAIN ACRYLICS!!!!!!!!! :)</li>
            <li>This product is my favorite nail strengthener.</li>
            <li>My toe nails have horizontal ridges (I haven&#x27;t been able to figure out why; it&#x27;s supposed to be from injuries to the nail beds</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve recommended it to many friends who complain their nails always peel or break because of household product use.  </li>
            <li>All have been pleased.  </li>
            <li>I had more ridges then</li>
            <li>There is probably a better product out there.</li>
            <li>This didn&#x27;t work for me, but perhaps you&#x27;ll have better luck.</li>
            <li>Make sure you get the NailTek top coat as well.</li>
            <li>I use 2 coats of filler and then the top coat.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I did, because this nail strengthener, truly works for me.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not even sure its been working for my nails.</li>
            <li>Love this product and never get fooled into buying bogus imitators.</li>
            <li>I wish I could remember whose channel it was because I would sure leave them a glowing</li>
            <li>I love it alone on my nails</li>
            <li>And it makes my nails break more then</li>
            <li>And buy the seche vite top coat because my nail polish has never chipped when I use that stuff.</li>
            <li>but I LOVE the foundation 2</li>
            <li>LOVE</li>
            <li>they look like beautiful healthy natural nails, which they are not!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This product is pretty good</li>
            <li>I love how strong my nails are</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this amazing product!</li>
            <li>My nail polish goes on smooth and nails feel ok.</li>
            <li>Goes on easy, dries to a matte finish.  </li>
            <li>Peels up easily.</li>
            <li>This makes my nails stronger, it doesn&#x27;t look like I&#x27;m wearing anything when I put it on, and it doesn&#x27;t chip easily.</li>
            <li>it works well, but Isn&#x27;t as strong as the intensive therapy.</li>
            <li>It makes my nails so strong that it hurts to bite them.</li>
            <li>They are getting so strong.</li>
            <li>I ordered Nailtek II twice, as it stays on and keeps the nails strong.</li>
            <li>The smell is too strong.</li>
            <li>They keep my nails strong with snapping.</li>
            <li>After using this product i have had strong health nails.</li>
            <li>My daughter told me about this foundation and from the first use it works amazing.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m probably gonna buy like 5 more of these because I love it so much!</li>
            <li>Nailtek filled the bill on both accounts.  </li>
            <li>After I apply, the nails are smooth but the ridges are still there.</li>
            <li>It is a terrific product that helps make nails look great as an undercover.</li>
            <li>this polish helps to strengthen the nails and smooth the ridges out but over time the ridges will go away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>b/c I truly didn&#x27;t enjoy sitting and getting my nails done</li>
            <li>It also filled in the ridges of my nails, making it appear healthier over time</li>
            <li>I swim several hours a week, and still have great nails.  </li>
            <li>It is quite fantastic.</li>
            <li>Also, the shipping was great and it came a day earlier than estimated.</li>
            <li>This and a calcium supplement make a real difference in having strong healthy nails.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, it works and was worth the $4!</li>
            <li>I will not be without it, my nails are pretty again :)</li>
            <li>My nails looked better, even after the first week.  </li>
            <li>First of I went from using the nail envy strengthener and the seche vite top coat to the nail intensive therapy and the nail tek foundation 2.</li>
            <li>So ultimately it breaks my nails on its own and when its used as a top coat it makes that lined look from your sheets.</li>
            <li>I work at a place where I am constantly lifting this and with this nail polish on its own or with another on top of it, my nails don&#x27;t break.</li>
            <li>My nails, when left to their own devices, are strong and smooth.</li>
            <li>Each day following, I add another coat until my nails feel good.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay, I really didn&#x27;t see a difference.</li>
            <li>but nobody who had used as many strengtheners as I have really believed it would work.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Bonus points for the fact that it dries with a perfectly matt finish and is translucent enough to match my exact natural nail shade.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Therefore, if you want a quick fix so to speak this would do the job.</li>
            <li>and it dries really quick</li>
            <li>A true first!</li>
            <li>I had an issue with the original order but they promptly made it right.  </li>
            <li>Realy liked, my nail pollish last so much longer super recomended!!</li>
            <li>This is the second time I purchased this product since i&#x60;m still very pleased with</li>
            <li>When my nails are once again healthy and strong, I only use it as an undercoat before polish.  </li>
            <li>right.</li>
            <li>Smoothes the nails right out...</li>
            <li>As a fingerstyle guitar player I&#x27;m always terrified I&#x27;ll chip or tear the nails on my right hand that I pick strings</li>
            <li>I have been trying for the past 5 years to find something to make my nails stronger and this is the best product I have tried so far.</li>
            <li>Even with the polish on, my nails that typically break and peel when I wear polish, are staying in remarkably in good condition.</li>
            <li>Thanks for the quick shipping.</li>
            <li>I first got this product from my hairdresser a couple of years ago and have been using it ever since.</li>
            <li>it has helped others--probably younger, healthy women.</li>
            <li>Stays on and really helped my nails grow!</li>
            <li>It fills ridges in pretty well too.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I have used this product.  </li>
            <li>I first heard about NailTek Foundation II on a youtube video.</li>
            <li>it is exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s does exact what it says it will...</li>
            <li>This product does exactly what I was looking for, it fills the ridges in my nails so the polish will stay on.</li>
            <li>It just does not work and on the packaging it is intended as a top coat and regular polish.</li>
            <li>It makes my nails smooth and the coor stands out a little more</li>
            <li>but I realized that it takes away the shine of my colored polish giving it a more flat and matte look.</li>
            <li>For those that wear nail polish every day, or pretty much every day, this will definitely help your nails stay healthy.</li>
            <li>And even better I had one nail that I had to file funny and clip the edge often because it would split down to the quick</li>
            <li>While it has not completely fixed my nail issues (the top layer tends to split and peel away), I did notice a difference when I stopped using it about a month ago.</li>
            <li>I have had ridges on my thumbnails as long as I can remember, but this product makes them smooth!</li>
            <li>I was looking for something that I can continue to layer daily, but this peels off very quickly.</li>
            <li>It definitely did not disappoint and the fact that the finish is matte lets you see more easily when it is dry.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x60;s is great for keeping your nails from turning yellow after all the dark nail polishes we tend to wear sometimes.&lt;br</li>
            <li>However, if your nails are prone to peeling or chipping, this will make them more brittle, dry, and prone to peeling.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s a handy little loop hole to sell junk and get by with it.  </li>
            <li>I think it looks and feels much smoother with one coat</li>
            <li>THANKS NAILTEK FOR MAKING MY NAILS</li>
            <li>and my nails have not broken yet.</li>
            <li>Some of my nails are very ridged.  </li>
            <li>I have tried absolutely everything, and this works.  </li>
            <li>These are better results than I expected.</li>
            <li>I really like how fast it dries.</li>
            <li>I have to say this really works.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I have tried all of them and this one really is like &amp;#34;foundation&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>Naitek is the only company that help my natural nails grow and remain healthy.  </li>
            <li>Helped my nails grow long and strong</li>
            <li>As for the nail strengthener, the change isn&#x27;t significantly noticeable, but there is definitely some difference.</li>
            <li>but it wasn&#x27;t what I was looking for, though it does strengthen your nails as is says it doesn&#x27;t last very long under your polish, though I&#x27;m sure it would be good if you use it by itself and can keep adding every few days to keep your nails stronger.  </li>
            <li>First I clean my nails, dry, then paint one coat.  </li>
            <li>I used to use Sally Hansen ridge filler, which I haven&#x27;t been able to find for a couple of years, so I resorted to sanding down the ridges.  </li>
            <li>I will definitely be ordering more in the future.....</li>
            <li>As I have gotten older my nails have gotten weaker.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After some months of application, the fingernail ends soften to become flexible and rarely break and chip, and when they do, there are no painful splits down to the flesh.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>There were enough positive comments, that I was willing to give this a try.  </li>
            <li>and I was able to roll some off by applying a little pressure on it.  </li>
            <li>I had to give it at least two stars because it is effective at helping nail polish adhere without chipping.</li>
            <li>Love the thin formula that applies evenly and quickly.</li>
            <li>Then I noticed right away how it smoothed out my entire nail surface</li>
            <li>/&gt;With about 5 coats I can pretty much double the thickness of my nail edge,</li>
            <li>It helps protect your nail from yellowing if you use dark shades and leave the nail polish on pretty much until you&#x27;ve peeled it off.</li>
            <li>The product I received is clear and did not match what was advertised.</li>
            <li>I still use the clear coat but dont have to use the ridge filler anymore.</li>
            <li>I made the decision about a month ago to natural nails.</li>
            <li>Upon making this decision my common sense kicked in and said &amp;#34;Unless you plan on wearing gloves after you have them removed you better look for something to help with this decision&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>I tried the Nailtek Foundation No. 2 because I have a lot of ridges in a few of my nails and it worked beautifully to smooth them out.  </li>
            <li>I am so surprised.</li>
            <li>The bottle I received was for treating soft, peeling nails.  </li>
            <li>I have used it twice so far.</li>
            <li>reinforcing them and taking some of the load off my natural nail.</li>
            <li>It creates a good matt base coat and primer which helps nail color go on smooth.</li>
            <li>Formaldehyde is in most nail polishes but it doesn&#x27;t mean you should ignore it&#x27;s danger.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t seem to get my pointer and middle fingers on my dominant hand to stop peeling, but my other nails seem to do ok when using this product regularly.</li>
            <li>This product may have been old as it did not dry and remained sticky.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many hard as nails types of base coats, that didn&#x27;t work, so had pretty much given up being able to wear polish on my natural nails, without them peeling and cracking.  </li>
            <li>Of course, I like to paint them, and this totally wrecks them -- makes them soft and peeling in no time.</li>
            <li>Its thin, so I apply about 4 coats, it drys in seconds, and then two coats of nail polish and then two of a nail strengthening top coat.</li>
            <li>I top it off with Revlon &amp;#34;Nail brightener&amp;#34; -- just one thin coat.</li>
            <li>This goes on thin and dries super fast.</li>
            <li>I love this product and it is a fantastic base coat.  </li>
            <li>After a couple of hours playing for a few days I&#x27;ll likely have to touch it up some, but it&#x27;s well worth the time to keep my nails</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, it also chips very easily.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> Does a good job of filling ridges for a smoother finish.</li>
            <li> It also dries quickly to a matte finish, so it&#x27;s undetecable, perfect for men who want groomed nails without the shine.  </li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this product.  </li>
            <li> Very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> My toenails are happy campers :) Looking forward to seeing how it does on my fingernails.</li>
            <li> and I was able to fool people into thinking they were acrylics!</li>
            <li> To fix that problem, I use a coat of OPI Nail Envy underneath, then put on the Nailtek No. 2 foundation, put on polish and then use another coat of the OPI Nail Envy as a top coat and it works like a charm!</li>
            <li> and it works beautifully, goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> my nails are stronger because of the foundation 2 and it is amazing.</li>
            <li> This foundation 2 is amazing</li>
            <li> AMAZING just what i wanted</li>
            <li> Facilitates the ability to grow your own nails.</li>
            <li> weren&#x27;t looking as nice as they used to.</li>
            <li> My length was nice</li>
            <li> It leaves that perfect matte finish that you want before applying the polish, which makes the polish apply on much smoother and cleaner.</li>
            <li> The foundation 2 you can wear on its own</li>
            <li> /&gt;It gives a very nice, smooth surface to work on.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a nail biter for years and this stuff is strong and a good deterrent to bite.</li>
            <li> and this is a great product the first time!</li>
            <li> So I guess I have to use it more often to see any kind of results because I haven&#x27;t seen it yet.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t comment on the claim of stronger nails, but so far I&#x27;m very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> It makes my nails nice and smooth and my nail polish seems to glide on nicely after using it.</li>
            <li> but I received it quickly and the bottle was in good shape so that is what matters to me.</li>
            <li> I used to never have my own nails that were strong.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> I love this product and it does work</li>
            <li> and then my colored polish on top.</li>
            <li> giltter don&#x27;t put a top coat of Nailtek</li>
            <li> AGAIN ACRYLICS!!!!!!!!! :)</li>
            <li> This product is my favorite nail strengthener.</li>
            <li> My toe nails have horizontal ridges (I haven&#x27;t been able to figure out why; it&#x27;s supposed to be from injuries to the nail beds</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve recommended it to many friends who complain their nails always peel or break because of household product use.  </li>
            <li> All have been pleased.  </li>
            <li> I had more ridges then</li>
            <li> There is probably a better product out there.</li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t work for me, but perhaps you&#x27;ll have better luck.</li>
            <li> Make sure you get the NailTek top coat as well.</li>
            <li> I use 2 coats of filler and then the top coat.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I did, because this nail strengthener, truly works for me.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not even sure its been working for my nails.</li>
            <li> Love this product and never get fooled into buying bogus imitators.</li>
            <li> I wish I could remember whose channel it was because I would sure leave them a glowing</li>
            <li> I love it alone on my nails</li>
            <li> And it makes my nails break more then</li>
            <li> And buy the seche vite top coat because my nail polish has never chipped when I use that stuff.</li>
            <li> but I LOVE the foundation 2</li>
            <li> LOVE</li>
            <li> they look like beautiful healthy natural nails, which they are not!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product is pretty good</li>
            <li> I love how strong my nails are</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this amazing product!</li>
            <li> My nail polish goes on smooth and nails feel ok.</li>
            <li> Goes on easy, dries to a matte finish.  </li>
            <li> Peels up easily.</li>
            <li> This makes my nails stronger, it doesn&#x27;t look like I&#x27;m wearing anything when I put it on, and it doesn&#x27;t chip easily.</li>
            <li> it works well, but Isn&#x27;t as strong as the intensive therapy.</li>
            <li> It makes my nails so strong that it hurts to bite them.</li>
            <li> They are getting so strong.</li>
            <li> I ordered Nailtek II twice, as it stays on and keeps the nails strong.</li>
            <li> The smell is too strong.</li>
            <li> They keep my nails strong with snapping.</li>
            <li> After using this product i have had strong health nails.</li>
            <li> My daughter told me about this foundation and from the first use it works amazing.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m probably gonna buy like 5 more of these because I love it so much!</li>
            <li> Nailtek filled the bill on both accounts.  </li>
            <li> After I apply, the nails are smooth but the ridges are still there.</li>
            <li> It is a terrific product that helps make nails look great as an undercover.</li>
            <li> this polish helps to strengthen the nails and smooth the ridges out but over time the ridges will go away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> b/c I truly didn&#x27;t enjoy sitting and getting my nails done</li>
            <li> It also filled in the ridges of my nails, making it appear healthier over time</li>
            <li> I swim several hours a week, and still have great nails.  </li>
            <li> It is quite fantastic.</li>
            <li> Also, the shipping was great and it came a day earlier than estimated.</li>
            <li> This and a calcium supplement make a real difference in having strong healthy nails.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, it works and was worth the $4!</li>
            <li> I will not be without it, my nails are pretty again :)</li>
            <li> My nails looked better, even after the first week.  </li>
            <li> First of I went from using the nail envy strengthener and the seche vite top coat to the nail intensive therapy and the nail tek foundation 2.</li>
            <li> So ultimately it breaks my nails on its own and when its used as a top coat it makes that lined look from your sheets.</li>
            <li> I work at a place where I am constantly lifting this and with this nail polish on its own or with another on top of it, my nails don&#x27;t break.</li>
            <li> My nails, when left to their own devices, are strong and smooth.</li>
            <li> Each day following, I add another coat until my nails feel good.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay, I really didn&#x27;t see a difference.</li>
            <li> but nobody who had used as many strengtheners as I have really believed it would work.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Bonus points for the fact that it dries with a perfectly matt finish and is translucent enough to match my exact natural nail shade.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Therefore, if you want a quick fix so to speak this would do the job.</li>
            <li> and it dries really quick</li>
            <li> A true first!</li>
            <li> I had an issue with the original order but they promptly made it right.  </li>
            <li> Realy liked, my nail pollish last so much longer super recomended!!</li>
            <li> This is the second time I purchased this product since i&#x60;m still very pleased with</li>
            <li> When my nails are once again healthy and strong, I only use it as an undercoat before polish.  </li>
            <li> right.</li>
            <li> Smoothes the nails right out...</li>
            <li> As a fingerstyle guitar player I&#x27;m always terrified I&#x27;ll chip or tear the nails on my right hand that I pick strings</li>
            <li> I have been trying for the past 5 years to find something to make my nails stronger and this is the best product I have tried so far.</li>
            <li> Even with the polish on, my nails that typically break and peel when I wear polish, are staying in remarkably in good condition.</li>
            <li> Thanks for the quick shipping.</li>
            <li> I first got this product from my hairdresser a couple of years ago and have been using it ever since.</li>
            <li> it has helped others--probably younger, healthy women.</li>
            <li> Stays on and really helped my nails grow!</li>
            <li> It fills ridges in pretty well too.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have used this product.  </li>
            <li> I first heard about NailTek Foundation II on a youtube video.</li>
            <li> it is exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s does exact what it says it will...</li>
            <li> This product does exactly what I was looking for, it fills the ridges in my nails so the polish will stay on.</li>
            <li> It just does not work and on the packaging it is intended as a top coat and regular polish.</li>
            <li> It makes my nails smooth and the coor stands out a little more</li>
            <li> but I realized that it takes away the shine of my colored polish giving it a more flat and matte look.</li>
            <li> For those that wear nail polish every day, or pretty much every day, this will definitely help your nails stay healthy.</li>
            <li> And even better I had one nail that I had to file funny and clip the edge often because it would split down to the quick</li>
            <li> While it has not completely fixed my nail issues (the top layer tends to split and peel away), I did notice a difference when I stopped using it about a month ago.</li>
            <li> I have had ridges on my thumbnails as long as I can remember, but this product makes them smooth!</li>
            <li> I was looking for something that I can continue to layer daily, but this peels off very quickly.</li>
            <li> It definitely did not disappoint and the fact that the finish is matte lets you see more easily when it is dry.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x60;s is great for keeping your nails from turning yellow after all the dark nail polishes we tend to wear sometimes.&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, if your nails are prone to peeling or chipping, this will make them more brittle, dry, and prone to peeling.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s a handy little loop hole to sell junk and get by with it.  </li>
            <li> I think it looks and feels much smoother with one coat</li>
            <li> THANKS NAILTEK FOR MAKING MY NAILS</li>
            <li> and my nails have not broken yet.</li>
            <li> Some of my nails are very ridged.  </li>
            <li> I have tried absolutely everything, and this works.  </li>
            <li> These are better results than I expected.</li>
            <li> I really like how fast it dries.</li>
            <li> I have to say this really works.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I have tried all of them and this one really is like &amp;#34;foundation&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> Naitek is the only company that help my natural nails grow and remain healthy.  </li>
            <li> Helped my nails grow long and strong</li>
            <li> As for the nail strengthener, the change isn&#x27;t significantly noticeable, but there is definitely some difference.</li>
            <li> but it wasn&#x27;t what I was looking for, though it does strengthen your nails as is says it doesn&#x27;t last very long under your polish, though I&#x27;m sure it would be good if you use it by itself and can keep adding every few days to keep your nails stronger.  </li>
            <li> First I clean my nails, dry, then paint one coat.  </li>
            <li> I used to use Sally Hansen ridge filler, which I haven&#x27;t been able to find for a couple of years, so I resorted to sanding down the ridges.  </li>
            <li> I will definitely be ordering more in the future.....</li>
            <li> As I have gotten older my nails have gotten weaker.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After some months of application, the fingernail ends soften to become flexible and rarely break and chip, and when they do, there are no painful splits down to the flesh.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> There were enough positive comments, that I was willing to give this a try.  </li>
            <li> and I was able to roll some off by applying a little pressure on it.  </li>
            <li> I had to give it at least two stars because it is effective at helping nail polish adhere without chipping.</li>
            <li> Love the thin formula that applies evenly and quickly.</li>
            <li> Then I noticed right away how it smoothed out my entire nail surface</li>
            <li> /&gt;With about 5 coats I can pretty much double the thickness of my nail edge,</li>
            <li> It helps protect your nail from yellowing if you use dark shades and leave the nail polish on pretty much until you&#x27;ve peeled it off.</li>
            <li> The product I received is clear and did not match what was advertised.</li>
            <li> I still use the clear coat but dont have to use the ridge filler anymore.</li>
            <li> I made the decision about a month ago to natural nails.</li>
            <li> Upon making this decision my common sense kicked in and said &amp;#34;Unless you plan on wearing gloves after you have them removed you better look for something to help with this decision&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I tried the Nailtek Foundation No. 2 because I have a lot of ridges in a few of my nails and it worked beautifully to smooth them out.  </li>
            <li> I am so surprised.</li>
            <li> The bottle I received was for treating soft, peeling nails.  </li>
            <li> I have used it twice so far.</li>
            <li> reinforcing them and taking some of the load off my natural nail.</li>
            <li> It creates a good matt base coat and primer which helps nail color go on smooth.</li>
            <li> Formaldehyde is in most nail polishes but it doesn&#x27;t mean you should ignore it&#x27;s danger.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t seem to get my pointer and middle fingers on my dominant hand to stop peeling, but my other nails seem to do ok when using this product regularly.</li>
            <li> This product may have been old as it did not dry and remained sticky.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many hard as nails types of base coats, that didn&#x27;t work, so had pretty much given up being able to wear polish on my natural nails, without them peeling and cracking.  </li>
            <li> Of course, I like to paint them, and this totally wrecks them -- makes them soft and peeling in no time.</li>
            <li> Its thin, so I apply about 4 coats, it drys in seconds, and then two coats of nail polish and then two of a nail strengthening top coat.</li>
            <li> I top it off with Revlon &amp;#34;Nail brightener&amp;#34; -- just one thin coat.</li>
            <li> This goes on thin and dries super fast.</li>
            <li> I love this product and it is a fantastic base coat.  </li>
            <li> After a couple of hours playing for a few days I&#x27;ll likely have to touch it up some, but it&#x27;s well worth the time to keep my nails</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it also chips very easily.  </li>
            <li> I had a hard time finding this product after my original vendor closed their business.  </li>
            <li> This was a small amount of money and I regret that many buyers will just not take the time to make a complaint with Amazon,  but everyone should.  </li>
            <li> I have had ridges for too long</li>
            <li> People with poor business ethics are sell junk and laugh all the way to the bank.   </li>
            <li> I had given up painting my nails because the polish would pop off same day due to the ridges on my nails.  </li>
            <li> A single coat applied was still gummy</li>
            <li> Strange!!</li>
            <li> In fact since since this is a personal product, being used on the body,  a reputable seller would  be interested in finding out why the product failed, and if it is a bad batch</li>
            <li> The ridges are filling in and I&#x27;m able to wear polish without them looking bad.</li>
            <li> I expected that after reading the reviews.  </li>
            <li> My nails were not weak or thin while I used this product.</li>
            <li> So, I&#x27;m on the hunt for a product that can resolve and prevent this, and from other reviews it looked like this</li>
            <li> My favorite nail base.</li>
            <li> I love this base coat.</li>
            <li> I was hoping it was more of a strengthener base coat</li>
            <li> The NailTeck Foundation II Ridge-Filling Nail Strengthener Base Coat that I ordered is better than what I had before.</li>
            <li> I use as a base coat and also a top coat.</li>
            <li> so my nails are always suffering, but this has been helping my nails grow stronger and they&#x27;ve been breaking a lot less.</li>
            <li> its even making them a little stronger.</li>
            <li> Then not only will I have ridges, I&#x27;ll also have weak brittle nails.  </li>
            <li> It was fine as a base coat, preventing staining and helping the polish stay on longer, but it did not prevent the demise of my nails.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing base coat!</li>
            <li> It holds what it promises - smoothes out rigdes, and provides a smooth and matte base for the nail polish to be applied to.</li>
            <li> I have ridges and uneven nail surface.</li>
            <li> But I went a few days without anything</li>
            <li> Also, my nails split on a few that would weaken them.  </li>
            <li> I apply it to fill deep waves in machine-damaged thumbnails that grow with deep waves since decades ago and to strengthen the ends of fingernails that crack and tear making painful</li>
            <li> I thought $4 for nail polish was pricey since I usually get my for cheaper</li>
            <li> Anyways, I put one coat on and it dried instantly-no wait at all!</li>
            <li> What a waste of money!</li>
            <li> I have worn acrylic and gel nails for the past 20 years.</li>
            <li> This made my nails a grotesque yellow color.</li>
            <li> I have hard ridged nails and needed ridge filler.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve noticed lately,</li>
            <li> No more acrylics!</li>
            <li> Anyone who has weak nails needs this nail therapy.  </li>
            <li> This plus Nail Tek II has given me tough as iron nails.  </li>
            <li> so I just used it as a regular base coat.</li>
            <li> It was recommended as a ridge filling base coat that would help your polish last longer.</li>
            <li> as a base coat polish does last longer and you can&#x27;t see the ridges.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, I personally did not notice a difference in the strength of my nails...and using it as a base coat didn&#x27;t seem to make a difference</li>
            <li> The peeling issues got worse and started happening to nails that hadn&#x27;t peeled while using the product.</li>
            <li> I use it as a base coat whenever I&#x27;m painting my nails, and it dries almost instantly.</li>
            <li> It did that job so well that I stopped using my other base coats and exclusively started using this.</li>
            <li> However, I was a little disappointed because it began to clump after a month or two</li>
            <li> I bought this because my nails are very weak and peel all of the time.  </li>
            <li> I did not notice a change in my very weak and pealing nails.</li>
            <li> This seller does not assume responsibility for what he sells and will not refund your money for this useless product.</li>
            <li> Sorry I can&#x27;t rate this product a 5 yet.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, for me it didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> The pain is as bad as a hangnail or worse.  </li>
            <li> I was afraid to touch them for fear they would bend and brake, but they have not.</li>
            <li> REALLY LOUSY!  </li>
            <li> I have horrible nail ridges, always have, and lately it&#x27;s bothered me.  </li>
            <li> Also, it seems to be almost impossible to remove.</li>
            <li> My nails were sooooo weak!!!</li>
            <li> Very infuriating to find this out</li>
            <li> The Nailtek Foundation II Ridge filling base coat is phenomonal.  </li>
            <li> I use this as my base coat</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for almost 3 weeks, by putting on 2 base coats, then colored polish over that.  </li>
            <li> Ruffles and I hated the look.</li>
            <li> This ridge filler base coat gets the job done, but man, even for nail polish, this stuff smells awful.</li>
            <li> It is very painful.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s how horrible my nails are.</li>
            <li> Too soon to tell if the product will help me with my terrible nails,</li>
            <li> This is a terrible product.  </li>

            <li> My favorite nail base. Lets me apply color evenly and without streaks. Love the thin formula that applies evenly and quickly.</li>
            <li> This seller does not assume responsibility for what he sells and will not refund your money for this useless product. A single coat applied was still gummy an hour later it and I was able to roll some off by applying a little pressure on it.  I asked this Amazon seller for a refund and they refused,  I was told to contact the manufacturer. That&#x27;s a handy little loop hole to sell junk and get by with it.  I&#x27;m going to take this to Amazon disputes over the principles of this issue..  ZERO STARS  &amp;#62;&amp;#62;&amp;#62;  Update:  Amazon contacted this seller and they refused again and told me to contact manufacturer.  Amazon told me rather than keep me waiting while the seller gives me a run-around , they said Amazon would give my refund.   This was a small amount of money and I regret that many buyers will just not take the time to make a complaint with Amazon,  but everyone should.  People with poor business ethics are sell junk and laugh all the way to the bank.   In fact since since this is a personal product, being used on the body,  a reputable seller would  be interested in finding out why the product failed, and if it is a bad batch and  could it be a health hazard.    THANK YOU AMAZON !!</li>
            <li> Worked miracles. Helped my nails grow long and strong and I was able to fool people into thinking they were acrylics! However, I was a little disappointed because it began to clump after a month or two</li>
            <li> The Nailtek Foundation II Ridge filling base coat is phenomonal.  I&#x27;ve been looking for a good ridge filler for some time and didn&#x27;t want to spend a ton of money.  Nailtek filled the bill on both accounts.  Goes on easy, dries to a matte finish.  One coat and you&#x27;re good to go.  I will definitely be ordering more in the future.....</li>
            <li> another great nail tek product. Facilitates the ability to grow your own nails. No more acrylics!! I love nail tek products!!!</li>
            <li> It holds what it promises - smoothes out rigdes, and provides a smooth and matte base for the nail polish to be applied to. Good brush.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product a month ago and I can&#x27;t judge how well it should work. After I apply, the nails are smooth but the ridges are still there. My nail polish goes on smooth and nails feel ok. Sorry I can&#x27;t rate this product a 5 yet.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It is a terrific product that helps make nails look great as an undercover.</li>
            <li> I love this product and it does work but I&#x27;ve noticed lately, when I apply it, the tips of my fingers actually hurt for about 20 minutes.  It is very painful.  The pain is as bad as a hangnail or worse.  This only happens when I use the ridge filler.  Strange!!</li>
            <li> I only wore acrylic nails for a month and they ruined my nails! I have ridges and uneven nail surface. It looks bumpy when you view the nail from the side. I will never again wear acrylic that&#x27;s how horrible my nails are. So I decided to give this a shot since it had great reviews. I thought $4 for nail polish was pricey since I usually get my for cheaper......ahahhaha yeah I&#x27;m a cheapo. Anyways, I put one coat on and it dried instantly-no wait at all! Then I noticed right away how it smoothed out my entire nail surface all the ridges were literally smoothed out! They are not permanently gone bc this polish helps to strengthen the nails and smooth the ridges out but over time the ridges will go away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Therefore, if you want a quick fix so to speak this would do the job. I think one coat is enough but some suggest two coats. I think it looks and feels much smoother with one coat and then my colored polish on top. You can go ahead and put another coat of Nailtek over your colored polish but I realized that it takes away the shine of my colored polish giving it a more flat and matte look. So if you want your polish to shine and giltter don&#x27;t put a top coat of Nailtek just use it as your base.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it works and was worth the $4! THANKS NAILTEK FOR MAKING MY NAILS LOOK GREAT AGAIN!&lt;br /&gt;NEVER AGAIN ACRYLICS!!!!!!!!! :)</li>
            <li> I have used this manufactures intensive therapy outer coating before and it works great .   I bought this so i could use it  because it&#x27;s sateen finished, it&#x27;s made to be an under coat and I use it as a finial coat.   it works well, but Isn&#x27;t as strong as the intensive therapy.</li>
            <li> My nails, when left to their own devices, are strong and smooth. Of course, I like to paint them, and this totally wrecks them -- makes them soft and peeling in no time. So, I&#x27;m on the hunt for a product that can resolve and prevent this, and from other reviews it looked like this was it. Unfortunately, for me it didn&#x27;t work. It was fine as a base coat, preventing staining and helping the polish stay on longer, but it did not prevent the demise of my nails. Search continuing... (And when/if I find my miracle product, I&#x27;ll update!)</li>
            <li> Great product and can give good reviews for the seller as well.  I had an issue with the original order but they promptly made it right.  I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I love this base coat. You can use it alone to help repair nails after acrylics. It noticeably strengthens the nails and fills in any ridges! I will definitely purchase again!</li>
            <li> Covers the ridges while nourishing your nail. It helps protect your nail from yellowing if you use dark shades and leave the nail polish on pretty much until you&#x27;ve peeled it off. Also it helps the color nail polish stay on your nail longer. Will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> I first got this product from my hairdresser a couple of years ago and have been using it ever since. It makes my nails so strong that it hurts to bite them. And it&#x27;s not shiny, so my husband can use it.</li>
            <li> Have used this product before &amp; am happy with it.</li>
            <li> This product was brought to my attention by a beauty guru/professional. I have been using this for about a week and my nails have not broken yet. I have been trying all different types of hardeners all my life and none have worked, my nails will still keep breaking farther and farther into my skin and bleeding no matter how short I keep them. This product is my favorite nail strengthener. Its thin, so I apply about 4 coats, it drys in seconds, and then two coats of nail polish and then two of a nail strengthening top coat. The one I use is Sally Hansen Diamond strength.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this product.  After just two weeks I can see a great improvement in my fingernails.</li>
            <li> I bought this because my nails are very weak and peel all of the time.  I was looking for something that I can continue to layer daily, but this peels off very quickly. What a waste of money!</li>
            <li> My toe nails have horizontal ridges (I haven&#x27;t been able to figure out why; it&#x27;s supposed to be from injuries to the nail beds but I&#x27;m unaware of having any injuries) for the last year now and pedicures I do myself weren&#x27;t looking as nice as they used to. I bought this and it completely filled the ridges in and nail polish glides on perfectly now! I also noticed my manicures last longer without chipping. Woot woot! Great product</li>
            <li> Formaldehyde is in most nail polishes but it doesn&#x27;t mean you should ignore it&#x27;s danger.  It is a known human carcinogen.    [...]</li>
            <li> Anyone who has weak nails needs this nail therapy.  Nail Tek is simply marvelous.  I use it as a manicurist recommended:  First I clean my nails, dry, then paint one coat.  Each day following, I add another coat until my nails feel good.  When my nails are once again healthy and strong, I only use it as an undercoat before polish.  Occasionally, I add it between coats of polish. I&#x27;ve recommended it to many friends who complain their nails always peel or break because of household product use.  All have been pleased.  This and a calcium supplement make a real difference in having strong healthy nails.</li>
            <li> REALLY LOUSY!  Does NOTHING for my nails.  Do NOT recommend this product to anyone--yet I know (from some reviews) it has helped others--probably younger, healthy women.</li>
            <li> What a great product.  I have had ridges for too long and this is a great product the first time!</li>
            <li> So listen.... I have worn acrylic and gel nails for the past 20 years. So imagine how damaged my nails must have been. I made the decision about a month ago to natural nails. Just one day setting at work decided that&#x27;s what I wanted to do b/c I truly didn&#x27;t enjoy sitting and getting my nails done.....I did it b/c I loved how my hands looked with them. Upon making this decision my common sense kicked in and said &amp;#34;Unless you plan on wearing gloves after you have them removed you better look for something to help with this decision&amp;#34;. So I researched and found this product. I read the reviews and thought why not. After receiving the product I had my nails removed.  My length was nice but I wasn&#x27;t concerned about that. I had more ridges then Ruffles and I hated the look. My nails were sooooo weak!!! I&#x27;ve been applying the product as directed and 3 weeks later I have not lost a nail. They are getting so strong. I was afraid to touch them for fear they would bend and brake, but they have not. Each day they get stronger. The ridges are filling in and I&#x27;m able to wear polish without them looking bad. I&#x27;m not saying this product will work the same for everyone, but for me I will use it until they stop making it.</li>
            <li> This is a great product and Amazon has a great price.  I use this as my base coat and I notice an improvement in my nail health.  I was getting gel manis and my nails became destroyed.  I&#x27;ve been using this for around 3 months and I will keep using it.</li>
            <li> Too soon to tell if the product will help me with my terrible nails, but I can say the dealer did everything else right. Thanka</li>
            <li> This ridge filler base coat gets the job done, but man, even for nail polish, this stuff smells awful. I don&#x27;t know which horrid chemical ingredient is causing the scent- maybe the formaldehyde? Knocked a star off for the stench.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing !!!!! Stays on and really helped my nails grow! Paid almost $20  at a salon .. Cost a third of that at Amazon !!! Love it !!!!</li>
            <li> My brittle nails (post shellac manicures) were saved with Nailtek.  It also filled in the ridges of my nails, making it appear healthier over time</li>
            <li> I tried the Nailtek Foundation No. 2 because I have a lot of ridges in a few of my nails and it worked beautifully to smooth them out.  Unfortunately, it also chips very easily.  To fix that problem, I use a coat of OPI Nail Envy underneath, then put on the Nailtek No. 2 foundation, put on polish and then use another coat of the OPI Nail Envy as a top coat and it works like a charm!</li>
            <li> This product is pretty good but it wasn&#x27;t what I was looking for, though it does strengthen your nails as is says it doesn&#x27;t last very long under your polish, though I&#x27;m sure it would be good if you use it by itself and can keep adding every few days to keep your nails stronger.  I was hoping it was more of a strengthener base coat but it&#x27;s not and in some cases the polish seeped under and stained my nails which shouldn&#x27;t happen with a ridge filler but it did.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this product. Evens ridges in nail and keeps them from peeling</li>
            <li> This is a terrible product.  I bought three bottles.The brush came lose from the cap, and  I cannot use the product.  I opened the second bottle, and the same thing happened.  I would like the company to refund my money!!</li>
            <li> Not all what it&#x27;s cracked up to be but I  suppose it&#x27;s doing the job. There is probably a better product out there.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing base coat! It leaves that perfect matte finish that you want before applying the polish, which makes the polish apply on much smoother and cleaner. As for the nail strengthener, the change isn&#x27;t significantly noticeable, but there is definitely some difference. It definitely did not disappoint and the fact that the finish is matte lets you see more easily when it is dry. Definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> This is the second time I purchased this product since i&#x60;m still very pleased with it.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x60;s is great for keeping your nails from turning yellow after all the dark nail polishes we tend to wear sometimes.&lt;br /&gt;It gives a very nice, smooth surface to work on. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I went by the directions on the package. You keep adding layers of filler. This made my nails a grotesque yellow color.</li>
            <li> Some of my nails are very ridged.  I was truly hoping that this product would do the trick of filling the ridges so my polish would go on smoother and last longer.  I expected that after reading the reviews.  While it may provide some coverage, this is not working for me as it has for others.</li>
            <li> It makes my nails smooth and the coor stands out a little more and it dries really quick its even making them a little stronger.</li>
            <li> I like this product. It creates a good matt base coat and primer which helps nail color go on smooth. It fills ridges in pretty well too. But it took almost 2 weeks to arrive, so next time I will just go to the store and get it myself.</li>
            <li> I thought this stuff would be awesome, but honestly, it made my nails peel! The coat would only last a day or so before chipping, and when that happened, the nail would start to peel where the chip was. No bueno. This didn&#x27;t work for me, but perhaps you&#x27;ll have better luck.</li>
            <li> I was unsure this would work but it works quite well. I am so surprised. Make sure you get the NailTek top coat as well. I use 2 coats of filler and then the top coat. It also helps if you use Ecrinal nail strengthener under the ridge filler.</li>
            <li> This plus Nail Tek II has given me tough as iron nails.  I have tried absolutely everything, and this works.  I swim several hours a week, and still have great nails.  I top it off with Revlon &amp;#34;Nail brightener&amp;#34; -- just one thin coat.</li>
            <li> The NailTeck Foundation II Ridge-Filling Nail Strengthener Base Coat that I ordered is better than what I had before. Great!</li>
            <li> Great product.  Helps to strengthen nails and keeps them from chipping.  I use as a base coat and also a top coat.</li>
            <li> The bottle I received was for treating soft, peeling nails.  I have hard ridged nails and needed ridge filler.</li>
            <li> This goes on thin and dries super fast. I use 2 coats followed by 2 coats of the Nail-tek II nail therapy polish. I&#x27;ve been a nail biter for years and this stuff is strong and a good deterrent to bite. Great product.</li>
            <li> This did nothing for me so I just used it as a regular base coat.</li>
            <li> I love this product and it is a fantastic base coat.  Smoothes the nails right out...</li>
            <li> The package came a bit banged up but I received it quickly and the bottle was in good shape so that is what matters to me. I have used it twice so far. It makes my nails nice and smooth and my nail polish seems to glide on nicely after using it. Will update if anything changes but for now I am liking it.</li>
            <li> I had to give it at least two stars because it is effective at helping nail polish adhere without chipping. However, if your nails are prone to peeling or chipping, this will make them more brittle, dry, and prone to peeling. Switched to Nailtiques #2 and it helped them recover.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have used this product.  I used it in combo with the intensive therapy treatment.  It made the polish stick longer, and offered a matte finish to the nail that looked similar to the acrylic on manicured nails! My nails look great and I get lots of compliments. A true first!</li>
            <li> I ordered Nailtek II twice, as it stays on and keeps the nails strong. I apply it to fill deep waves in machine-damaged thumbnails that grow with deep waves since decades ago and to strengthen the ends of fingernails that crack and tear making painful felons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After some months of application, the fingernail ends soften to become flexible and rarely break and chip, and when they do, there are no painful splits down to the flesh. These are better results than I expected. Nailtek color looks the same as the rest of the nail where it isn&#x27;t applied, so it blends.</li>
            <li> I had a hard time finding this product after my original vendor closed their business.  Of course Amazon has a vendor for it!!!  Great product.  I will not be without it, my nails are pretty again :)</li>
            <li> Formaldehyde! This product contains formaldehyde which is toxic. I also purchased Nail Tek Intensive Therapy II. It also contains formaldehyde. Save your money! I gave it 1 star because giving it a zero star rating wasn&#x27;t an option.</li>
            <li> This product may have been old as it did not dry and remained sticky.  When I put polish on over it the polish&lt;br /&gt;looked gooey.  Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many hard as nails types of base coats, that didn&#x27;t work, so had pretty much given up being able to wear polish on my natural nails, without them peeling and cracking.  That is, till I read the reviews for this nail strengthener.  There were enough positive comments, that I was willing to give this a try.  I&#x27;m glad I did, because this nail strengthener, truly works for me.  I&#x27;ve used it for almost 3 weeks, by putting on 2 base coats, then colored polish over that.  My nails looked better, even after the first week.  Even with the polish on, my nails that typically break and peel when I wear polish, are staying in remarkably in good condition.</li>
            <li> The smell is too strong. The product I received is clear and did not match what was advertised. I&#x27;m not even sure its been working for my nails. its just ehh.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work.  Peels up easily. Not recommended for people who have finger or toe nails.</li>
            <li> Product worked great while letting my nails grow after taking acrylics off. My nails were not weak or thin while I used this product.</li>
            <li> Naitek is the only company that help my natural nails grow and remain healthy.  They keep my nails strong with snapping.</li>
            <li> As I have gotten older my nails have gotten weaker. I have been trying for the past 5 years to find something to make my nails stronger and this is the best product I have tried so far. This makes my nails stronger, it doesn&#x27;t look like I&#x27;m wearing anything when I put it on, and it doesn&#x27;t chip easily.</li>
            <li> I used to use Sally Hansen ridge filler, which I haven&#x27;t been able to find for a couple of years, so I resorted to sanding down the ridges.  I tried this and it works beautifully, goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li> Best nail hardener and strenghtener on the market!!!  Nails never chip or crack, nail polish stays on for two weeks!!  Love this product and never get fooled into buying bogus imitators.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay, I really didn&#x27;t see a difference.I have used it twice already. So I guess I have to use it more often to see any kind of results because I haven&#x27;t seen it yet. But the way he goes on it&#x27;s smoove!</li>
            <li> I first heard about NailTek Foundation II on a youtube video. I wish I could remember whose channel it was because I would sure leave them a glowing comment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product snuck up on me with all of it&#x27;s goodness. It was recommended as a ridge filling base coat that would help your polish last longer. It did that job so well that I stopped using my other base coats and exclusively started using this. I love it alone on my nails they look like beautiful healthy natural nails, which they are not!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Used as a base coat polish does last longer and you can&#x27;t see the ridges. But what I wasn&#x27;t expecting was that my nails actually got stronger. I know it says strengthener on the bottle but nobody who had used as many strengtheners as I have really believed it would work. I was happy with the long-lasting manicures and the ridge filling. But I went a few days without anything and it suddenly struck me that my nails weren&#x27;t peeling! And even better I had one nail that I had to file funny and clip the edge often because it would split down to the quick and I hadn&#x27;t had to deal with that in months!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using Nailtek 2 for about 9 months now and it is exactly as advertised. I love it! It did take a while but it does what it says. I highly recommend this amazing product!</li>
            <li> Great product it&#x27;s does exact what it says it will... The only thing I don&#x27;t like is the film it leaves which attracts your nails to dirt often</li>
            <li> Good product. Does a good job of filling ridges for a smoother finish.</li>
            <li> What is different about this polish, it is dries as matte. It will literally look like you have no nail polish on. It is quite fantastic. It will also not turn your nails yellow.&lt;br /&gt;However, I personally did not notice a difference in the strength of my nails...and using it as a base coat didn&#x27;t seem to make a difference either.&lt;br /&gt;Win some you lose some.</li>
            <li> For those that wear nail polish every day, or pretty much every day, this will definitely help your nails stay healthy.</li>
            <li> This product does exactly what I was looking for, it fills the ridges in my nails so the polish will stay on. Good price also!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried a lot of others, but I&#x27;m happy with this one and will buy it again when I run out. As a fingerstyle guitar player I&#x27;m always terrified I&#x27;ll chip or tear the nails on my right hand that I pick strings with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With about 5 coats I can pretty much double the thickness of my nail edge, reinforcing them and taking some of the load off my natural nail. I really like how fast it dries. After a couple of hours playing for a few days I&#x27;ll likely have to touch it up some, but it&#x27;s well worth the time to keep my nails protected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bonus points for the fact that it dries with a perfectly matt finish and is translucent enough to match my exact natural nail shade. Unless you look close you can&#x27;t see there&#x27;s any coating on the nail at all.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about a year now. While it has not completely fixed my nail issues (the top layer tends to split and peel away), I did notice a difference when I stopped using it about a month ago. The peeling issues got worse and started happening to nails that hadn&#x27;t peeled while using the product. I can&#x27;t seem to get my pointer and middle fingers on my dominant hand to stop peeling, but my other nails seem to do ok when using this product regularly.</li>
            <li> I used to never have my own nails that were strong. After using this product i have had strong health nails. I still use the clear coat but dont have to use the ridge filler anymore.</li>
            <li> I have horrible nail ridges, always have, and lately it&#x27;s bothered me.  If I get a manicure, I always ask for them to file them away and I get advised not to do that because it&#x27;ll weaken my nail. Then not only will I have ridges, I&#x27;ll also have weak brittle nails.  So I&#x27;ve lived with it... Until now.  This stuff is in no means a miracle cure, but it does lessen the appearance of ridges. It also dries quickly to a matte finish, so it&#x27;s undetecable, perfect for men who want groomed nails without the shine.  I&#x27;ve only had it for a week, so I can&#x27;t comment on the claim of stronger nails, but so far I&#x27;m very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> I did not notice a change in my very weak and pealing nails.</li>
            <li> I have had ridges on my thumbnails as long as I can remember, but this product makes them smooth! Also, it seems to be almost impossible to remove. The girl doing my next manicure had to soak in polish remover for 10 minutes to get it off, but it lasted for weeks!</li>
            <li> I have to say this really works. I work in a restaurant and deal with a lot of cleaning supplies and chemicals so my nails are always suffering, but this has been helping my nails grow stronger and they&#x27;ve been breaking a lot less. I use it as a base coat whenever I&#x27;m painting my nails, and it dries almost instantly. I&#x27;m probably gonna buy like 5 more of these because I love it so much! Also, the shipping was great and it came a day earlier than estimated. I would highly recommend!</li>
            <li> First of I went from using the nail envy strengthener and the seche vite top coat to the nail intensive therapy and the nail tek foundation 2. The nail tek intensive therapy never fully dries. I will do my nails 3 hours before I go to bed and wake up with the indentations from my sheet. And it makes my nails break more then the nail envy stuff does. So here is my suggestion buy the nail foundation 2 because it actually strengthens your nails I noticed my nails get stronger from that stuff within 2 days. And buy the seche vite top coat because my nail polish has never chipped when I use that stuff. The foundation 2 you can wear on its own and it still does the same thing. I did try putting on the nail tek intensive therapy stuff 2 days after painting my nails and it did the same thing. It just does not work and on the packaging it is intended as a top coat and regular polish. So ultimately it breaks my nails on its own and when its used as a top coat it makes that lined look from your sheets. Very infuriating to find this out but I LOVE the foundation 2 my nails are stronger because of the foundation 2 and it is amazing. This foundation 2 is amazing I love how strong my nails are I work at a place where I am constantly lifting this and with this nail polish on its own or with another on top of it, my nails don&#x27;t break. LOVE IT!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/Seche-Vite-Dry-Fast-Coat/dp/B00150LT40/ref&#x3D;sr_1_1?s&#x3D;beauty&amp;ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1363300431&amp;sr&#x3D;1-1&amp;keywords&#x3D;SECHE+VITE</li>
            <li> Thanks for the quick shipping. Item as described. Picture as described. Great product! Would purchase from again!</li>
            <li> My toenails are happy campers :) Looking forward to seeing how it does on my fingernails. Should it be fab I will try to update my review</li>
            <li> I had given up painting my nails because the polish would pop off same day due to the ridges on my nails.  Also, my nails split on a few that would weaken them.  My daughter told me about this foundation and from the first use it works amazing.  Now my nails are stronger than ever and polish stays on for four days before chipping.</li>
            <li> Nail are stronger for during six weeks plus.</li>
            <li> it says it will help fill ridges in your nails with continued use but I used it for three months with no change. it does fill the ridges when you put it on though.</li>
            <li> Realy liked, my nail pollish last so much longer super recomended!!</li>
            <li> This is the king of ridge fillers.  I have tried all of them and this one really is like &amp;#34;foundation&amp;#34;.  I never do my nails without it.</li>
            <li> AMAZING just what i wanted</li>
