            <li>Great buy have enuff for awail</li>
            <li>Great product at a good price.</li>
            <li>This deodorant is really good.</li>
            <li>- it was a good value.  </li>
            <li>Nice.</li>
            <li>yet, the Trimax in Brut is quite effective.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t been able to find this deodorant for my hubby anywhere til now.  </li>
            <li>This is my hubby&#x27;s favorite deodorant.</li>
            <li>It is not anti-perspirant, which ingredients most often affect my skin...</li>
            <li>I was sure I had rated this before, but I guess I did not do so.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite Brut deodorant.</li>
            <li>in most antiperspirants.</li>
            <li>I am laying in a supply while it is available! :)</li>
            <li>So glad Amazon started carrying this.  </li>
            <li>Quality of this Brut product has maintained, so many others have cheapened their ingredients</li>
            <li>He was not only happy with the product (which I knew he would be because, it&#x27;s his favorite)</li>
            <li>This is a perfect deal, as I cannot get on that cheap in any other store around my home.</li>
            <li>It does a much better job keeping me fresh all day.</li>
            <li>I was pleased with this purchase and everything arrived with no problems exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>We are happy with what we got however would have preferred being able to acquire the solid round deordorant as well</li>
            <li>original fragrance Brut does not bother my skin, my wife likes the scent (which seems to be compatible with a lot of other fragrances in soaps, shampoos, etc.), and most of all it is available at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>some of which irritate my husband&#x27;s skin (which is not generally sensitive!); smells nice too.</li>
            <li>Instead, I&#x27;d recommend the BRUT product that has alcohol as the first ingredient.</li>
            <li>I used to be able to buy a larger version of this product, but I can no longer find it.</li>
            <li>This is what really works for me!</li>
            <li>This is the best I have found and the only deodorant I have used for the past 30+ years.</li>
            <li>This is my husband&#x27;s favorite deodorant and we cannot find it in local stores any longer.  </li>
            <li>Better value than the other internet site I had to purchase originally.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s normally found in detergents and antibacterial handsoaps but has been phased out in most European countries.</li>
            <li>Delivery was fast...</li>
            <li>really fast delivery.</li>
            <li>Pleasant  and long lasting scent even after a vigorous one hour workout with heart rate above 145 and prolific perspiration.</li>
            <li>several others I have tried have irritated my skin; this one does not and adequately protects against odor and sweat staining my shirts.</li>
            <li>Better than having to keep looking at different places to find when your running low.</li>
            <li>This product isn&#x27;t strong enough to last the whole day.</li>
            <li>I have to buy straight deodorant; my skin seems to be sensitive to something (aluminum?)</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried damn near every underarm deodorant out there, and they all cause me to either break out or itch.  </li>
            <li>I am an old 47 year old thought.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;d be very useful if Brut noted the difference in formula as the round version and</li>
            <li>I was hoping this version of Brut Deodorant would be identical to the round 2.5oz version of this product but the ones I received are not: the fragrance is the same (which is great) but the feel is totally different and sadly a distant second.  </li>
            <li>I had a regret since the presentation of the product is different, but once I opened it it looks exactly the same as.</li>
            <li>This is the only deodorant I&#x27;ve been able to use effectively, no rashes, etc., for years.</li>
            <li>If anyone has sensitive skin problems, I definitely recommend using this deodorant.</li>
            <li>The round versions I&#x27;ve had are comprised of a less translucent and more solid base which goes on dry whereas this 2.25oz stick is based in a more slippery gel and feels more watery / sticky in comparison.  </li>
            <li>It was what I expected,  I highly recommend</li>

            <li> They make an anti-persperant, but that is not gentle like the deodorant.  </li>
            <li> product as expected.</li>
            <li> I buy in bulk as these do not melt away like other.  </li>

            <li> Not a deal breaker but a distinct disappointment.</li>
            <li> Feels unusually dry and waxy, with very little detectable Brut fragrance.  </li>

            <li> I buy it in bulk, because I usually can&#x27;t find it on store shelves.</li>
            <li> it is getting hard to find, and since i live in Thailand, it is impossible for me to get over here.  </li>
            <li> I am disappointed that the odor protection did not even last a 8 hour work day let alone 24 hours.</li>
            <li> Not happy.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Great deal thank you!!</li>
            <li> This product isn&#x27;t strong enough to last the whole day. Half way through the work day and I can already tell it&#x27;s wearing off. Instead, I&#x27;d recommend the BRUT product that has alcohol as the first ingredient. It does a much better job keeping me fresh all day. [[ASIN:B001ET77H0 Brut Deodorant, Round Solid, 2.5 Ounces (Pack of 6)]].</li>
            <li> This is the best deodorant ever, and I hope they never stop making and selling it.  it is getting hard to find, and since i live in Thailand, it is impossible for me to get over here.  I have to order it from Amazon.com</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t been able to find this deodorant for my hubby anywhere til now.  Perfect for a birthday gift for him.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried damn near every underarm deodorant out there, and they all cause me to either break out or itch.  BRUT is the only product that does the job and without the discomfort.</li>
            <li> I buy in bulk as these do not melt away like other.  The last forever.  I am an old 47 year old thought.</li>
            <li> Great buy have enuff for awail</li>
            <li> It is hard for us to find the Brut green deodorant so we bought several to have on stock for my husband.</li>
            <li> This is the deodorant I use. It works well for me. This is a perfect deal, as I cannot get on that cheap in any other store around my home. An excellent buy</li>
            <li> This is my hubby&#x27;s favorite deodorant. However, we can no longer purchase it in our area. He was not only happy with the product (which I knew he would be because, it&#x27;s his favorite) but also with the price and the prompt delivery of this. We will be placing another order soon.</li>
            <li> We are happy with what we got however would have preferred being able to acquire the solid round deordorant as well</li>
            <li> Delivery was fast... item is as described. Nice.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin. This is the only deodorant I&#x27;ve been able to use effectively, no rashes, etc., for years. I buy it in bulk, because I usually can&#x27;t find it on store shelves. It is not anti-perspirant, which ingredients most often affect my skin... yet, the Trimax in Brut is quite effective. If anyone has sensitive skin problems, I definitely recommend using this deodorant. My wife has even taken to it.</li>
            <li> It was what I expected,  I highly recommend</li>
            <li> I was hoping this version of Brut Deodorant would be identical to the round 2.5oz version of this product but the ones I received are not: the fragrance is the same (which is great) but the feel is totally different and sadly a distant second.  The round versions I&#x27;ve had are comprised of a less translucent and more solid base which goes on dry whereas this 2.25oz stick is based in a more slippery gel and feels more watery / sticky in comparison.  It&#x27;d be very useful if Brut noted the difference in formula as the round version and this version have identical type on the packaging.  Not a deal breaker but a distinct disappointment.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only deodorant I have ever used that doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.  They make an anti-persperant, but that is not gentle like the deodorant.  I used to be able to buy a larger version of this product, but I can no longer find it.</li>
            <li> Excellent!  This is what really works for me!</li>
            <li> several others I have tried have irritated my skin; this one does not and adequately protects against odor and sweat staining my shirts.</li>
            <li> How long have these packs been sitting in a warehouse (considering Brut hardly makes this oval version anymore)?  Feels unusually dry and waxy, with very little detectable Brut fragrance.  I&#x27;ve been buying the round version in stores, with faster product turnover...I&#x27;d probably stick with that from now on.</li>
            <li> arrived on time and as promised</li>
            <li> This deodorant is really good. You use it in the mornang and it protects you from odor all day long. Sometimes even after you take a bath at night, it still protects you! A very good one.!</li>
            <li> Better than having to keep looking at different places to find when your running low. Will do again .</li>
            <li> Contains Triclosan. Google it if you haven&#x27;t heard of it. It&#x27;s normally found in detergents and antibacterial handsoaps but has been phased out in most European countries. Studies (like actual studies, not from alarmist hippie/conspiracy theory websites) have proven that it&#x27;s harmful to humans after prolonged use (it alters your hormones, messes with your immune system, and is carcinogenic). I was really really disappointed when this pack arrived and I looked at the ingredients and saw it listed. Oh well. I&#x27;m using L&#x27;avilin now instead.</li>
            <li> I have been using this brand for over 20 years.  It is the only one that does not cause irritation.</li>
            <li> I am disappointed that the odor protection did not even last a 8 hour work day let alone 24 hours. Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> I was sure I had rated this before, but I guess I did not do so. This is my favorite Brut deodorant. I have used it for well over 40 years. But I can no longer find it in the local stores. Everyone has the antiperspirant, but not the deodorant. My skin does not like the aluminum in the antiperspirant, so that is what I like and use. I was pleased with this purchase and everything arrived with no problems exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t use anti-persperant, has aluminum, a neuro-toxin.</li>
            <li> This oval deodorant became unavailable in the local stores, so I can only purchase this item through Amazon Marketplace. I am allergic to all antiperspirants, so I purchase only deodorant with a non-overwhelming fragrance. This is the best I have found and the only deodorant I have used for the past 30+ years.</li>
            <li> Bought deodorant, got both deodorant mixed with anti-antiperspirant! Not happy. That&#x27;s why I buy online because I do not want the antiperspirant.</li>
            <li> product as expected. really fast delivery.</li>
            <li> I have to buy straight deodorant; my skin seems to be sensitive to something (aluminum?) in most antiperspirants. That limits my choices.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The original fragrance Brut does not bother my skin, my wife likes the scent (which seems to be compatible with a lot of other fragrances in soaps, shampoos, etc.), and most of all it is available at a reasonable price. I am laying in a supply while it is available! :)</li>
            <li> I had a regret since the presentation of the product is different, but once I opened it it looks exactly the same as. Thank you</li>
            <li> This is my husband&#x27;s favorite deodorant and we cannot find it in local stores any longer.  Finding it on-line has made him very happy!</li>
            <li> So glad Amazon started carrying this.  Better value than the other internet site I had to purchase originally.  Don&#x27;t even mind having to buy 6 - it was a good value.  Local stores stopped carrying this years ago &amp; when I had to go searching internet years ago to find it there were very few internet websites that carried it.&lt;br /&gt;P.S.  Quality of this Brut product has maintained, so many others have cheapened their ingredients some of which irritate my husband&#x27;s skin (which is not generally sensitive!); smells nice too.</li>
            <li> Great product at a good price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this deodorant for about 20 years.  In that time I&#x27;ve tried several different kinds and nothing stands up to its smell or how long it lasts.  Most local stores have stopped selling it which is a disappointment.  Recently I&#x27;ve started buying it in bulk so I have enough to last for awhile since it has become so hard to find.</li>
            <li> Pleasant  and long lasting scent even after a vigorous one hour workout with heart rate above 145 and prolific perspiration.</li>
