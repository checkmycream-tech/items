            <li>This is the best sunscreen out on the market.</li>
            <li>This is the BEST sunblock on the market in my opinion.</li>
            <li>Best sunblock in the universe</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is great!  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s my best friend.  </li>
            <li>Best ever, and this is coming from someone who&#x27;s had to use a LOT of sunscreen.</li>
            <li>It was wonderful!</li>
            <li>Otherwise, a very good suncreen.</li>
            <li>It smells great and it isn&#x27;t greasy feeling.</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>Thats great struff</li>
            <li>This sunblock does not irritate my skin at all and works great to keep the sun from burning my skin.</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t lie, I kind of miss the smell of baby sunblock, but this smells very good.  </li>
            <li>And it smells AMAZING!</li>
            <li>This is a good brand and always use it.</li>
            <li>If you are going to use it for swimming, it is a good sunscreen lotion.</li>
            <li>I always buy neutropenia sunscreen and have loved the spray.</li>
            <li>Does a good job of protecting your skin and being water-resistant, but does need to be reapplied, like all sunscreens.  </li>
            <li>It says its fragrance free; I found that it has a very pleasant scent.  </li>
            <li>LOL I was able to get a tan and not burn on our summer vacation in Florida.</li>
            <li>From the start, seeing this product by neurogena, a brand rather popular amongst skin treatment, I had already convinced myself that it should be a good product.</li>
            <li>I also love the Beach Defense stick sunscreen!</li>
            <li>Love this sunscreen!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>This lotion is not greasy, easy to apply, and is very effective when the label directions are followed.</li>
            <li>this stuff is amazing.  </li>
            <li>But  it&#x27;s actually really amazing sunblock.</li>
            <li>Smell nice.</li>
            <li>Smells really nice</li>
            <li>This has a nice beachy-scent to it.  </li>
            <li>It goes on nicely and feels like you&#x27;ve rubbed lotion into your skin (it&#x27;s infused with lotion.)  </li>
            <li>, I knew it was the perfect time to try the new sunscreen on my skin.</li>
            <li>Smells great and absorbs quickly into the skin.  </li>
            <li>By the end of the day, I must admit that I more than liked the product.</li>
            <li>It works great as sunscreen on summer hot days</li>
            <li>Great for the islands ..Where its always hot..</li>
            <li>I have very fair and sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>but still allows a tan :)</li>
            <li>though I mostly swim in an indoor pool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Thankfully, my husband and my son just tan, because if my son had gotten sunburned, I would have been even more ticked off.</li>
            <li>but i am ok with this sun bloch</li>
            <li>For my kids I use 75 spf or more, and I reapply every two hours.</li>
            <li>I just purchased this for a caribbean trip and LOVE it.</li>
            <li>I have very fair skin and have tried many different sunscreen products.</li>
            <li>I would DEFINITELY recommend to anyone who needs a good reliable sunscreen that feels good and doesn&#x27;t smell like you jumped into a chemical plant&#x27;s pool.  </li>
            <li>I am extremely fair, and it really protects me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very fair skinned and burn easily, so I have tried lots of different sunscreens.</li>
            <li>super fast, great product</li>
            <li>Summer Staple - Easy</li>
            <li>This is now my absolute favorite!</li>
            <li>It is a good product for the fact that besides providing protection against the sun, it also helps keeping my skin smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>During the entire stay at the park, I loved to see my skin staying smooth, shiny and healthy under the water.</li>
            <li>Light texture.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Given you can buy this and chuck it onto a Prime eligible order and get free shipping, do what I do and buy three bottles at a time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They need to make a fragrance free alternative to this.  </li>
            <li>Furthermore, as I came back to Amazon to save the product under my favorite, another good surprise popped up on my scree.</li>
            <li>It has a somewhat sticky/chalky finish at first, so be sure to apply and thoroughly rub in before going onto a beach as the sand will stick to it.</li>
            <li>It is useful and easy to carry.</li>
            <li>I work 7 hours outside under the sun with fair skin and my coworker have light skin.</li>
            <li>Has a clean smell, and I like the helioplex.  </li>
            <li>I have very red hair, fair skin, I know my sunblocks.  </li>
            <li>awesome sunscreen, not to thick</li>
            <li>Nice - Offers 100% Protection  -</li>
            <li>Item true to description.</li>
            <li>Great sunscreen lotion, it is not oily and lasts longer than other ones.</li>
            <li>And because my skin is as dry as a snack’s skin, keeping my skin smooth and strong besides a protection against the sun light was a very important feature to me.</li>
            <li>For me, the best things were the extra moisturizer and the cream’s ability to spread and dissolve evenly throughout my entire body.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also non-greasy and soaks in quickly.</li>
            <li>This is my new favorite - nice scent, non-greasy, non-oily, goes on smoothly, isn&#x27;t sticky, sheer cover.</li>
            <li>I reapplied constantly because I loved it so much!</li>
            <li>However, purchased the 70 beach defense and my teenage fair skinned son was burnt to a crisp in one hour.</li>
            <li>Sometimes during the stay at the park, because of the joy of the fun, I would forget and go over the time limit by half an hour.</li>
            <li>It goes one easily and without feeling totally greasy like so many.</li>
            <li>I have Eczema and and burn easily and most sunblocks irritate my skin a short time after applied.</li>
            <li>Not only does it contain an extra amount of moisturizer mixed with a fresh fragrance, the cream also is designed to be water proof which was more than perfect and convenient for any outdoor activity.</li>
            <li>I was in just about the most direct sun</li>
            <li>Skin cancer is NOT a lot of fun.</li>
            <li>Actually, after giving this new sunscreen a try, I could not help but give both of my thumbs up for a successful design.</li>
            <li>This is not a bad thing, it helps ensure I&#x27;m applying plenty of sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bike commute, and it seems to be pretty sweat-resistent with no awkward beading up or drips, and it seems to work pretty well in the pool, too---</li>
            <li>Both my husband and daughter are fair and extremely cautious with sunscreen.</li>
            <li>As a matter of fact, I did not hesitate to try it right after my friend gave me the bottle.</li>
            <li>Furthermore, the fact that the cream could spread and dissolve quickly and evenly throughout my skin without leaving any visible white marks was what charmed me even more.</li>
            <li>Indeed, even though that was my first time using a sunscreen, having read a lot about cosmetic before, I had rarely seen any product with moisturizer until I came across this Beach Defense.</li>
            <li>To be able to stay protected under the radiating sun of Texas and have a lot of fun at the water park, the cream only came with the price of $7.91.</li>
            <li>I typically miss a spot on the backs on my arms, and when I come in from running that spot will be bright red and burnt every time, but the rest of me is fine!</li>
            <li>The designed level for water proof in this sunscreen was increased up to 70 UPF, a mark much higher than any of its competitors.</li>
            <li>It is not odorless, but the smell is not enough to make you gag, like so many</li>
            <li>It rubs in very quickly, as in, I&#x27;ve occasionally had to apply more because I hadn&#x27;t finished spreading it over my arm or leg before it rubbed in.</li>
            <li>I love Neutrogena products and have used several of there sunscreen products throughout the years, however I will not be using the BEACH Defense Product again and do not recommend it.</li>
            <li>I like that it is double the size of the tube most suncreens are sold in.  </li>
            <li>Some people might enjoy it, but if you are sensitive to fragrance</li>
            <li>I am an avid tanner.</li>
            <li>I go to the tanning salon once a week, and when it&#x27;s appropriate, I tan outside.</li>
            <li>I am a seasoned pro when it comes to reapplying and avoiding getting burnt.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s something that I&#x27;m willing to use too.</li>
            <li>These were the things that made me very curious about how effective the cream could be.</li>
            <li>However, there is a good potential it will do some internal damage based on its ingredients:</li>
            <li>Smells good and keeps my white, white.</li>
            <li>I agree with this person who gave a positive review about the cream.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a sunscreen that would be strong enough to keep me from turning into a lobster but not be toxic to the skin.  </li>
            <li>Protect my skill from sunburn very well.</li>
            <li>This works very well,fair skin and blond hair, in the sun for seven hours and did not get burned.</li>
            <li>But it works okay for days spent outdoors.</li>
            <li>Works very well.....</li>
            <li>and I really like it.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, it&#x27;s a good sunscreen, and I like the fact that it&#x27;s a better value than the other sunscreens I&#x27;ve been using due to the larger tube.</li>
            <li>I used it in the desert of Africa and it not only blocked the sun but helped my skin become soft and smooth.”</li>
            <li>I used it in the desert of Africa and it not only blocked the sun but helped my skin become soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>HIGHLY RECOMMEND for anyone with allergies or sensitivity to skin products</li>
            <li>especially for the HOT Southwest FL Sun!</li>
            <li>My boyfriend and I are both extremely sensitive to the sun (he blisters and I get sun poisoning) which doesn&#x27;t work well since we are very outdoorsy people.</li>
            <li>As it turned out, the cream left me with no disappointment.  </li>
            <li>I have a history of magically burning through other 70 and even 90 spf sunblocks, so I actually wasn&#x27;t expecting much of this stuff.</li>
            <li>It seemed to absorb well into our skin, but the moment we got in the water, you could see the lotion turn white again and wash right off.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is light and coconutty, not at all beachy like some other sunscreens.</li>
            <li>Live in Southwest Fla all of our lives I have never been so burnt.</li>
            <li>While it won&#x27;t replace my current favorite, I will definitely use it in the future on days where I know I&#x27;ll be sweating a lot or hitting an outdoor pool.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The consistency is very liquidy, so be careful as it will drip everywhere if you put too much in your hand at once.</li>
            <li>Both my spouse and my daughter are so burned, it&#x27;s clear that the product offered NO protection.</li>
            <li>I reapplied every 2 hours, and still got an epic burn.</li>
            <li>one can be in and this protected me completely.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think I would like this sunscreen as much as I do when I initially tried it.</li>
            <li>, I received a response back, they were very receptive to my complaints and are reimbursing me money, however that is not why I had contacted them.  </li>
            <li>The rash has persisted for almost 2 weeks so far.  </li>
            <li>so far has been to offer me some coupons.  </li>
            <li>So I usually use 30 spf for me, because I do not burn easily.</li>
            <li>When he received the package, he told me that it was a new product called Beach Defense being presented as new chemical formula with double the effectiveness.</li>
            <li>have use other Neutrogena products with success.</li>
            <li>I find out it&#x27;s done the exact same thing the Rite Aid brand generic knock-off Sport Sunblock did when I tried it -</li>
            <li>The first day I thought maybe I didn&#x27;t use enough, so the second day I put on two coats and rubbed it all over.  </li>
            <li>Such a high resistance proved the cream’s effectiveness as I was not worried about the cream on my skin being removed by the water.</li>
            <li>I recently spent 9 days in Puerto Rico and came home without a sunburn thanks to this stuff (plus other reasonable precautions, such as consistently wearing a hat).</li>
            <li>I purchased this recently because I needed a new bottle of sunblock for my kids (ages 1 &amp; 6).  </li>
            <li>I am glad I didn&#x27;t read these negative reviews prior to buying this.</li>
            <li>Having had major episodes dealing with basel cell carcinoma since the 70&#x27;s, I speak from experience when I tell you just bath in this stuff and protect your skin.</li>
            <li>It feels gross, gets on your clothes, and eventually will smear &amp; drip off completely leaving your skin unprotected.  </li>
            <li>companies aren&#x27;t supposed to be marketing SPF&#x27;s over 55 because research suggests there&#x27;s barely a difference between SPF 55 and 70 or SPF 55 and 100.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t like the smell of other sunscreens</li>
            <li>My friend who was told my the doctor to be very diligent about sun protection due to an elevated risk for skin cancer also used this and got tanned which is the opposite of what he wanted.  </li>
            <li>Also, I really like the smell...which is an odd thing to say about sunscreen.  </li>
            <li>We bring along the Neutrogena Beach Defense Sunscreen spray for easy reapplication at the beach or pool (since it is hard to reapply sunscreen lotions while your skin is sandy or wet).  </li>

            <li> This is my new favorite - nice scent, non-greasy, non-oily, goes on smoothly, isn&#x27;t sticky, sheer cover.</li>
            <li> I reapplied constantly because I loved it so much!</li>
            <li> However, purchased the 70 beach defense and my teenage fair skinned son was burnt to a crisp in one hour.</li>
            <li> Sometimes during the stay at the park, because of the joy of the fun, I would forget and go over the time limit by half an hour.</li>
            <li> It goes one easily and without feeling totally greasy like so many.</li>
            <li> I have Eczema and and burn easily and most sunblocks irritate my skin a short time after applied.</li>
            <li> Not only does it contain an extra amount of moisturizer mixed with a fresh fragrance, the cream also is designed to be water proof which was more than perfect and convenient for any outdoor activity.</li>
            <li> I was in just about the most direct sun</li>
            <li> Skin cancer is NOT a lot of fun.</li>
            <li> Actually, after giving this new sunscreen a try, I could not help but give both of my thumbs up for a successful design.</li>
            <li> This is not a bad thing, it helps ensure I&#x27;m applying plenty of sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bike commute, and it seems to be pretty sweat-resistent with no awkward beading up or drips, and it seems to work pretty well in the pool, too---</li>
            <li> Both my husband and daughter are fair and extremely cautious with sunscreen.</li>
            <li> As a matter of fact, I did not hesitate to try it right after my friend gave me the bottle.</li>
            <li> Furthermore, the fact that the cream could spread and dissolve quickly and evenly throughout my skin without leaving any visible white marks was what charmed me even more.</li>
            <li> Indeed, even though that was my first time using a sunscreen, having read a lot about cosmetic before, I had rarely seen any product with moisturizer until I came across this Beach Defense.</li>
            <li> To be able to stay protected under the radiating sun of Texas and have a lot of fun at the water park, the cream only came with the price of $7.91.</li>
            <li> I typically miss a spot on the backs on my arms, and when I come in from running that spot will be bright red and burnt every time, but the rest of me is fine!</li>
            <li> The designed level for water proof in this sunscreen was increased up to 70 UPF, a mark much higher than any of its competitors.</li>
            <li> It is not odorless, but the smell is not enough to make you gag, like so many</li>
            <li> It rubs in very quickly, as in, I&#x27;ve occasionally had to apply more because I hadn&#x27;t finished spreading it over my arm or leg before it rubbed in.</li>
            <li> I love Neutrogena products and have used several of there sunscreen products throughout the years, however I will not be using the BEACH Defense Product again and do not recommend it.</li>
            <li> I like that it is double the size of the tube most suncreens are sold in.  </li>
            <li> Some people might enjoy it, but if you are sensitive to fragrance</li>
            <li> I am an avid tanner.</li>
            <li> I go to the tanning salon once a week, and when it&#x27;s appropriate, I tan outside.</li>
            <li> I am a seasoned pro when it comes to reapplying and avoiding getting burnt.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s something that I&#x27;m willing to use too.</li>
            <li> These were the things that made me very curious about how effective the cream could be.</li>
            <li> However, there is a good potential it will do some internal damage based on its ingredients:</li>
            <li> Smells good and keeps my white, white.</li>
            <li> I agree with this person who gave a positive review about the cream.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a sunscreen that would be strong enough to keep me from turning into a lobster but not be toxic to the skin.  </li>
            <li> Protect my skill from sunburn very well.</li>
            <li> This works very well,fair skin and blond hair, in the sun for seven hours and did not get burned.</li>
            <li> But it works okay for days spent outdoors.</li>
            <li> Works very well.....</li>
            <li> and I really like it.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, it&#x27;s a good sunscreen, and I like the fact that it&#x27;s a better value than the other sunscreens I&#x27;ve been using due to the larger tube.</li>
            <li> I used it in the desert of Africa and it not only blocked the sun but helped my skin become soft and smooth.”</li>
            <li> I used it in the desert of Africa and it not only blocked the sun but helped my skin become soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> HIGHLY RECOMMEND for anyone with allergies or sensitivity to skin products</li>
            <li> especially for the HOT Southwest FL Sun!</li>
            <li> My boyfriend and I are both extremely sensitive to the sun (he blisters and I get sun poisoning) which doesn&#x27;t work well since we are very outdoorsy people.</li>
            <li> As it turned out, the cream left me with no disappointment.  </li>
            <li> I have a history of magically burning through other 70 and even 90 spf sunblocks, so I actually wasn&#x27;t expecting much of this stuff.</li>
            <li> It seemed to absorb well into our skin, but the moment we got in the water, you could see the lotion turn white again and wash right off.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is light and coconutty, not at all beachy like some other sunscreens.</li>
            <li> Live in Southwest Fla all of our lives I have never been so burnt.</li>
            <li> While it won&#x27;t replace my current favorite, I will definitely use it in the future on days where I know I&#x27;ll be sweating a lot or hitting an outdoor pool.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The consistency is very liquidy, so be careful as it will drip everywhere if you put too much in your hand at once.</li>
            <li> Both my spouse and my daughter are so burned, it&#x27;s clear that the product offered NO protection.</li>
            <li> I reapplied every 2 hours, and still got an epic burn.</li>
            <li> one can be in and this protected me completely.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think I would like this sunscreen as much as I do when I initially tried it.</li>
            <li> , I received a response back, they were very receptive to my complaints and are reimbursing me money, however that is not why I had contacted them.  </li>
            <li> The rash has persisted for almost 2 weeks so far.  </li>
            <li> so far has been to offer me some coupons.  </li>
            <li> So I usually use 30 spf for me, because I do not burn easily.</li>
            <li> When he received the package, he told me that it was a new product called Beach Defense being presented as new chemical formula with double the effectiveness.</li>
            <li> have use other Neutrogena products with success.</li>
            <li> I find out it&#x27;s done the exact same thing the Rite Aid brand generic knock-off Sport Sunblock did when I tried it -</li>
            <li> The first day I thought maybe I didn&#x27;t use enough, so the second day I put on two coats and rubbed it all over.  </li>
            <li> Such a high resistance proved the cream’s effectiveness as I was not worried about the cream on my skin being removed by the water.</li>
            <li> I recently spent 9 days in Puerto Rico and came home without a sunburn thanks to this stuff (plus other reasonable precautions, such as consistently wearing a hat).</li>
            <li> I purchased this recently because I needed a new bottle of sunblock for my kids (ages 1 &amp; 6).  </li>
            <li> I am glad I didn&#x27;t read these negative reviews prior to buying this.</li>
            <li> Having had major episodes dealing with basel cell carcinoma since the 70&#x27;s, I speak from experience when I tell you just bath in this stuff and protect your skin.</li>
            <li> It feels gross, gets on your clothes, and eventually will smear &amp; drip off completely leaving your skin unprotected.  </li>
            <li> companies aren&#x27;t supposed to be marketing SPF&#x27;s over 55 because research suggests there&#x27;s barely a difference between SPF 55 and 70 or SPF 55 and 100.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t like the smell of other sunscreens</li>
            <li> My friend who was told my the doctor to be very diligent about sun protection due to an elevated risk for skin cancer also used this and got tanned which is the opposite of what he wanted.  </li>
            <li> Also, I really like the smell...which is an odd thing to say about sunscreen.  </li>
            <li> We bring along the Neutrogena Beach Defense Sunscreen spray for easy reapplication at the beach or pool (since it is hard to reapply sunscreen lotions while your skin is sandy or wet).  </li>
            <li> In fact, I&#x27;ve never used any sunscreen that just flat out didn&#x27;t work before.  </li>
            <li> I used it on my left hand when driving a long distance and got tanned based on the fact that I can now see a watch mark.  </li>
            <li> An hour and a half of direct exposure each day</li>
            <li> I cant see any difference between this and other much more expensive ones.</li>
            <li> my child is a swimmer, uses it year long.</li>
            <li> On the other hand, the only thing I did not like it about this sunscreen was the time limit under the water.</li>
            <li> I also use Neutrogena Dry Touch Sunblock on my face, but wanted to find a sunblock I could use on my back/arms/etc...</li>
            <li> (I usually reapply every 60-80 minutes if I&#x27;m in prolonged and direct sunlight.)  </li>
            <li> The only thing that caused me to knock it down a star was the fragrance.  </li>
            <li> If you want something which works and you don&#x27;t need to re-apply every 30 minutes (wet or dry)</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t think that the little 3oz bottle would last us very long.  </li>
            <li> But if you are going to use it for everyday use because you are dealing with outside work, do not use it.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t use it as my everyday sunscreen because whenever I sweat it turns white and rubs off on whatever I touch (like my couch and the inside of the car door).</li>
            <li> I was going to buy the Neutrogena Wet Skin lotion</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not very greasy</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way so this bottle will last us probably half the summer.  </li>
            <li> and it was a complete failure.</li>
            <li> But, it&#x27;s one of the few \\&quot;non greasy\\&quot; sunscreens that actually lives up to its name even when applying the proper amount (approximately one ounce for the entire body.)</li>
            <li> Other than that, when it dries it makes my skin feel moisturized and silky.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Tried it again here at home the other day to give it another chance, I applied it 50 mins before we we to the pool.</li>
            <li> I always buy SPF 70 from Neutrogena and can see and feel the difference with other brands.</li>
            <li> (unfortunately it didn&#x27;t appear the first day).  </li>
            <li> This stuff does not sweat off, and for those with allergies, the scent is extremely faint - most sunblocks make me sneeze like crazy, but I barely even notice this one.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy it, it&#x27;s not worth your money.</li>
            <li> Not worth the risk.</li>
            <li> And let me tell you, when it starts dripping down your forehead into your eyes, if feels like freakin&#x27; acid.</li>
            <li> and it worked extremely well!  </li>
            <li> If they claim 80 minutes of water resistance, but can&#x27;t handle well under half that time of sweat, I wouldn&#x27;t trust it at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t  typically burn, either.  </li>
            <li> It does feel a little greasy on the inside of my elbows and knees, but I&#x27;ve yet to find a sunblock that doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> took off one star for the fact that it&#x27;s rated SPF70, when FDA studies have shown that there is no significant difference between an SPF of 50 and one of 70 or 100.</li>
            <li> It was a little off putting to smell like a pina colada.</li>
            <li> Epic fail.</li>
            <li> We went on a float trip a few weeks ago and tried neutrogena beach defense 70 spf lotion.</li>
            <li> Starting on that time, sunscreen lotion has become impossible to miss every summer vacation if one were to open my summer pack.</li>
            <li> My daughter had SPF 30 on first, and where the 30 had been applied is not burned, but where the 70 had been applied, she is burned so badly that I&#x27;m not sure it will be gone during the remainder of our time in Hawaii.</li>
            <li> However, these drawbacks were really not meaningful compared to the satisfaction the cream has given me.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a temporary stand-in for the Banana Boat Sport sunblock I usually use.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Nutrogena  sunscreen in the past and never had a problem with it.  </li>
            <li> Usually that does the trick.</li>
            <li> 4 of us used the sunscreen at least once an hour at the beach and all of us got burned.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m so badly sunburned I can barely move.  </li>
            <li> Not only did it fail me, but it failed my husband and son as well.  </li>
            <li> Moving on to anther less expensive product that I know works.</li>
            <li> This is not a good product.</li>
            <li> I trashed my few uniforms because of the ugly looking yellow-orange stains.</li>
            <li> I used this product 2 days in a row and developed a terrible rash on my arms and legs</li>
            <li> This stuff is useless, and is in NO way waterproof. &#x3D;(</li>
            <li> Needless to say we are sticking with this sunscreen!</li>
            <li> We may have a bad lot, but we will never purchase again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so bad</li>
            <li> My son and I got sunburnt badly within 1 hour of applying on skin.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m terribly disappointed in this product.  </li>
            <li> This has been a painful terrible experience.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> This is the worst sunscreen I have ever used!</li>
            <li> anywhere I used the sunblock and sweated, there was this nasty, oily, clear-white gel/residue on my skin.  </li>
            <li> Worst product ever.  </li>
            <li> Absolutely horrible!</li>
            <li> Terrible product.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m very fair skinned and burn easily, so I have tried lots of different sunscreens. This is now my absolute favorite! It smells great and it isn&#x27;t greasy feeling. I also love the Beach Defense stick sunscreen!</li>
            <li> It worked as design. It kept us protected from the sun&#x27;s rays. However, there is a good potential it will do some internal damage based on its ingredients: Oxybenzone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Read the Environmental Working Group&#x27;s review:&lt;br /&gt;http://www.ewg.org/2015sunscreen/hall-of-shame/</li>
            <li> This is the worst sunscreen I have ever used! I reapplied every 2 hours, and still got an epic burn. Neutrogena should take this product off of the market!!!</li>
            <li> Does not work. Applied before and one hour later but still BURNED at the beach. (In the shade).</li>
            <li> It is useful and easy to carry.</li>
            <li> I had never used the sunscreen lotion in my life until one of my friends introduced it to me after buying on Amazon during one summer. Starting on that time, sunscreen lotion has become impossible to miss every summer vacation if one were to open my summer pack. In fact, the sunscreen bottle in traduced to me from my friend was by Neurogena. And being a cosmetic expert as I am, I have never doubted the brand’s trusted quality. When he received the package, he told me that it was a new product called Beach Defense being presented as new chemical formula with double the effectiveness. These were the things that made me very curious about how effective the cream could be. As a matter of fact, I did not hesitate to try it right after my friend gave me the bottle. One week after that day, as my family and I had plan to go to the water park together, I knew it was the perfect time to try the new sunscreen on my skin. By the end of the day, I must admit that I more than liked the product. Not only does it contain an extra amount of moisturizer mixed with a fresh fragrance, the cream also is designed to be water proof which was more than perfect and convenient for any outdoor activity. Actually, after giving this new sunscreen a try, I could not help but give both of my thumbs up for a successful design. For me, the best things were the extra moisturizer and the cream’s ability to spread and dissolve evenly throughout my entire body. Indeed, even though that was my first time using a sunscreen, having read a lot about cosmetic before, I had rarely seen any product with moisturizer until I came across this Beach Defense. And because my skin is as dry as a snack’s skin, keeping my skin smooth and strong besides a protection against the sun light was a very important feature to me. Furthermore, the fact that the cream could spread and dissolve quickly and evenly throughout my skin without leaving any visible white marks was what charmed me even more. The designed level for water proof in this sunscreen was increased up to 70 UPF, a mark much higher than any of its competitors. Such a high resistance proved the cream’s effectiveness as I was not worried about the cream on my skin being removed by the water. During the entire stay at the park, I loved to see my skin staying smooth, shiny and healthy under the water. On the other hand, the only thing I did not like it about this sunscreen was the time limit under the water. Every two hours, for insured efficiency and protection, I had to re- applied the cream on my skin. Sometimes during the stay at the park, because of the joy of the fun, I would forget and go over the time limit by half an hour. A review said, “This is the best sunscreen out on the market. I used it in the desert of Africa and it not only blocked the sun but helped my skin become soft and smooth.” I agree with this person who gave a positive review about the cream. It is a good product for the fact that besides providing protection against the sun, it also helps keeping my skin smooth and soft. However, these drawbacks were really not meaningful compared to the satisfaction the cream has given me. From the start, seeing this product by neurogena, a brand rather popular amongst skin treatment, I had already convinced myself that it should be a good product. As it turned out, the cream left me with no disappointment.  Furthermore, as I came back to Amazon to save the product under my favorite, another good surprise popped up on my scree. To be able to stay protected under the radiating sun of Texas and have a lot of fun at the water park, the cream only came with the price of $7.91.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a temporary stand-in for the Banana Boat Sport sunblock I usually use.  It&#x27;s description was similar; water resistant to 80 minutes, SPF over 45.  I put it on and wore it for the one 45 min bike ride I needed it for, during which I&#x27;d definitely sweat some.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that I&#x27;ve arrived at home I find out it&#x27;s done the exact same thing the Rite Aid brand generic knock-off Sport Sunblock did when I tried it - anywhere I used the sunblock and sweated, there was this nasty, oily, clear-white gel/residue on my skin.  It feels gross, gets on your clothes, and eventually will smear &amp; drip off completely leaving your skin unprotected.  If they claim 80 minutes of water resistance, but can&#x27;t handle well under half that time of sweat, I wouldn&#x27;t trust it at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Total garbage, one star, do not buy.  I have very red hair, fair skin, I know my sunblocks.  Banana Boat Sport and Coppertone Sport are the only ones that handle sweat and water well.</li>
            <li> I was in just about the most direct sun one can be in and this protected me completely.  If you want something which works and you don&#x27;t need to re-apply every 30 minutes (wet or dry) this stuff is amazing.  I ran out and searched 5 stores to find another bottle.  It&#x27;s a must have if you are going somewhere where you aren&#x27;t accustomed to the amount of UV rays you are going to be exposed to.</li>
            <li> Light texture. Not sticky. Smell nice. Protect my skill from sunburn very well. The only con is that I applied it to my face (which I shouldn&#x27;t) and it a bit stung my face.</li>
            <li> awesome sunscreen, not to thick and i have not been burned when i applied this.</li>
            <li> This works very well,fair skin and blond hair, in the sun for seven hours and did not get burned.</li>
            <li> I cant see any difference between this and other much more expensive ones. This is a good brand and always use it.</li>
            <li> Summer Staple - Easy To Apply - Smells Nice - Offers 100% Protection  - but still allows a tan :)</li>
            <li> Love this sunscreen! Just came back from Aruba and used this sunscreen and it worked awesome.  We applied it several times since we were in the sun all day and it worked extremely well!  Would definitely recommend this item!</li>
            <li> I use this all the time, douse myself on face and neck and arms before working in yard and garden. Consumer Reports gave it a 93% score, among the highest rated sun screens they have tested. It goes one easily and without feeling totally greasy like so many. It is not odorless, but the smell is not enough to make you gag, like so many sunscreens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Given you can buy this and chuck it onto a Prime eligible order and get free shipping, do what I do and buy three bottles at a time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. If you are not using sunscreen, why not? Having had major episodes dealing with basel cell carcinoma since the 70&#x27;s, I speak from experience when I tell you just bath in this stuff and protect your skin. Skin cancer is NOT a lot of fun. I speak from experience. Plus you will prevent wrinkling with age, the majority of which is caused by overexposure to sun.</li>
            <li> excellent product.  Performs as advertised.</li>
            <li> Well packaged by Amazon. Great product.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think I would like this sunscreen as much as I do when I initially tried it. But, it&#x27;s one of the few \\&quot;non greasy\\&quot; sunscreens that actually lives up to its name even when applying the proper amount (approximately one ounce for the entire body.) It does feel a little greasy on the inside of my elbows and knees, but I&#x27;ve yet to find a sunblock that doesn&#x27;t. Other than that, when it dries it makes my skin feel moisturized and silky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The consistency is very liquidy, so be careful as it will drip everywhere if you put too much in your hand at once. The fragrance is light and coconutty, not at all beachy like some other sunscreens. It rubs in very quickly, as in, I&#x27;ve occasionally had to apply more because I hadn&#x27;t finished spreading it over my arm or leg before it rubbed in. This is not a bad thing, it helps ensure I&#x27;m applying plenty of sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bike commute, and it seems to be pretty sweat-resistent with no awkward beading up or drips, and it seems to work pretty well in the pool, too--- though I mostly swim in an indoor pool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took off one star for the fact that it&#x27;s rated SPF70, when FDA studies have shown that there is no significant difference between an SPF of 50 and one of 70 or 100. SPF30 blocks 97% of rays, and 50 blocks 98%. No sunscreen blocks 100% of rays, and so I feel it&#x27;s a bit misleading to label products with SPFs above 50 in an attempt to reach consumers who may not be educated about SPF ratings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it&#x27;s a good sunscreen, and I like the fact that it&#x27;s a better value than the other sunscreens I&#x27;ve been using due to the larger tube. While it won&#x27;t replace my current favorite, I will definitely use it in the future on days where I know I&#x27;ll be sweating a lot or hitting an outdoor pool.</li>
            <li> If I could give this product zero stars, I would. Both my husband and daughter are fair and extremely cautious with sunscreen. I purchased this based on review from consumer reports. Epic fail. We were at the beach for 90 minutes. Both my spouse and my daughter are so burned, it&#x27;s clear that the product offered NO protection. My daughter had SPF 30 on first, and where the 30 had been applied is not burned, but where the 70 had been applied, she is burned so badly that I&#x27;m not sure it will be gone during the remainder of our time in Hawaii. We may have a bad lot, but we will never purchase again. A call to Neutrogena&#x27;s 800 number has been placed.&lt;br /&gt;If amazon reviews allowed for photos, I&#x27;d post the one of my spouses burned and blistered back?  Stick with a different brand!</li>
            <li> The item I received is not what is pictured in the advertisement  Bait and switch.  If you are looking for barrier lotion, this is not it.</li>
            <li> super fast, great product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Nutrogena  sunscreen in the past and never had a problem with it.  In fact, I&#x27;ve never used any sunscreen that just flat out didn&#x27;t work before.  Until now.  Two days of using this stuff and I&#x27;m so badly sunburned I can barely move.  The first day I thought maybe I didn&#x27;t use enough, so the second day I put on two coats and rubbed it all over.  And it&#x27;s not like I was in the sun for the entire day.  An hour and a half of direct exposure each day and it was a complete failure. I don&#x27;t  typically burn, either.  I&#x27;m terribly disappointed in this product.  Not only did it fail me, but it failed my husband and son as well.  Don&#x27;t buy it, it&#x27;s not worth your money.</li>
            <li> Worst product ever.  Doesn&#x27;t even deserve one star. I went to the beach applied liberally and am fried red everywhere that I put the sunscreen. And I reapplied several times.  Usually that does the trick. Never will buy this again and the company will be hearing from me.</li>
            <li> Should be zero stars. 4 of us used the sunscreen at least once an hour at the beach and all of us got burned. Mine even blistered. Don&#x27;t buy this garbage.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t purchased this, but last I checked companies aren&#x27;t supposed to be marketing SPF&#x27;s over 55 because research suggests there&#x27;s barely a difference between SPF 55 and 70 or SPF 55 and 100.</li>
            <li> Smells really nice but it doesn&#x27;t protect you against the sun.  I used it on my left hand when driving a long distance and got tanned based on the fact that I can now see a watch mark.  My friend who was told my the doctor to be very diligent about sun protection due to an elevated risk for skin cancer also used this and got tanned which is the opposite of what he wanted.  Not worth the risk.</li>
            <li> Used as directed applied 15 minutes prior to sun exposure for duration of 80 minutes &amp; my face is burnt.&lt;br /&gt;I have use other Neutrogena products with success. Is this quality control issue or did I have a reaction? Moving on to anther less expensive product that I know works.</li>
            <li> Great product! I use it every day.</li>
            <li> Live in Southwest Fla all of our lives I have never been so burnt. We applied before going to the beach, after we got there, several times through out the day did not work at all, we were fried.  I contacted Neutrogena the following business day via email, I received a response back, they were very receptive to my complaints and are reimbursing me money, however that is not why I had contacted them.  I wanted to let them know that they need to tweek their product before they call it BEACH Defense. I love Neutrogena products and have used several of there sunscreen products throughout the years, however I will not be using the BEACH Defense Product again and do not recommend it. especially for the HOT Southwest FL Sun!</li>
            <li> I would give this Zero stars if I could. Went to the beach last week, applied this to me, my husband and my son 30 mins before we even got there. It seemed to absorb well into our skin, but the moment we got in the water, you could see the lotion turn white again and wash right off. And let me tell you, when it starts dripping down your forehead into your eyes, if feels like freakin&#x27; acid. Got all of us out of the water, went back to shade and reapplied, keeping everyone out of the water and in the shade for 40 mins, same thing happened. And I STILL got burned. Thankfully, my husband and my son just tan, because if my son had gotten sunburned, I would have been even more ticked off. Tried it again here at home the other day to give it another chance, I applied it 50 mins before we we to the pool. Same thing happened. This stuff is useless, and is in NO way waterproof. &#x3D;( Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Absolutely horrible! Used this after 10 days at the beach with no burn. The day I applied this I had a severe burn after only 60 minutes in the sun. It&#x27;s so bad I&#x27;m considering seeing a doctor to see if there is anyway to soothe this burn. The pictures are from about 36 hours after the sun exposure.</li>
            <li> Thats great struff i am alirgect to sun but i am ok with this sun bloch</li>
            <li> If you are going to use it for swimming, it is a good sunscreen lotion. But if you are going to use it for everyday use because you are dealing with outside work, do not use it. I work 7 hours outside under the sun with fair skin and my coworker have light skin. I tried this Beach Defense 70 lotion while my coworker used the Beach defense 70 spray.  It works great as sunscreen on summer hot days but once we sweat, the sleeves in our uniforms stains to yellow-orange color. I used it for two weeks before me and my coworker figured it out that it was caused by Neutrogena Beach Defense sunscreen. I tried to remove it with bleach, oxyclean and stain remover, the  yellow-orange stain cannot be removed.  I trashed my few uniforms because of the ugly looking yellow-orange stains.</li>
            <li> I like this sunscreen. It absorbs well and isn&#x27;t greasy.  I like that it is double the size of the tube most suncreens are sold in.  It will last a while.  It did the job during a recent beach trip.  The only thing that caused me to knock it down a star was the fragrance.  Some people might enjoy it, but if you are sensitive to fragrance it is not for you.  It was a little off putting to smell like a pina colada. They need to make a fragrance free alternative to this.  Otherwise, a very good suncreen.</li>
            <li> I am glad I didn&#x27;t read these negative reviews prior to buying this. I purchased this at a local store before our Florida vacation. I am an avid tanner. I go to the tanning salon once a week, and when it&#x27;s appropriate, I tan outside. So I usually use 30 spf for me, because I do not burn easily. I am a seasoned pro when it comes to reapplying and avoiding getting burnt. For my kids I use 75 spf or more, and I reapply every two hours. So with that said, this stuff works GREAT! And it smells AMAZING! I love it! I reapplied constantly because I loved it so much! LOL I was able to get a tan and not burn on our summer vacation in Florida. At the beach &amp; pool! I recommend it, if again, you know that you can use 30 spf and you know how to reapply when needed.</li>
            <li> Great sunscreen lotion, it is not oily and lasts longer than other ones.</li>
            <li> I always buy SPF 70 from Neutrogena and can see and feel the difference with other brands. It literally will leave a a mark of a line if you miss spots of sun burnt if you don&#x27;t get it all over.</li>
            <li> This is the best sunscreen out on the market. I used it in the desert of Africa and it not only blocked the sun but helped my skin become soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> I always buy neutropenia sunscreen and have loved the spray. However, purchased the 70 beach defense and my teenage fair skinned son was burnt to a crisp in one hour. He is madder than heck as he applied liberally as he always does and he is burnt all over. This is not a good product. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I always like Neutrogena sunscreens.  This has a nice beachy-scent to it.  Does a good job of protecting your skin and being water-resistant, but does need to be reapplied, like all sunscreens.  We bring along the Neutrogena Beach Defense Sunscreen spray for easy reapplication at the beach or pool (since it is hard to reapply sunscreen lotions while your skin is sandy or wet).  The spray is less protection than the lotion (like all sprays), but does a decent job.</li>
            <li> This lotion is not greasy, easy to apply, and is very effective when the label directions are followed. I recommend it.</li>
            <li> I just purchased this for a caribbean trip and LOVE it. I have very fair skin and have tried many different sunscreen products. This is my new favorite - nice scent, non-greasy, non-oily, goes on smoothly, isn&#x27;t sticky, sheer cover. I actually looked forward to putting it on every day before hitting the beach!</li>
            <li> Smells great and absorbs quickly into the skin.  It has a somewhat sticky/chalky finish at first, so be sure to apply and thoroughly rub in before going onto a beach as the sand will stick to it.</li>
            <li> I have a history of magically burning through other 70 and even 90 spf sunblocks, so I actually wasn&#x27;t expecting much of this stuff. But  it&#x27;s actually really amazing sunblock. I am extremely fair, and it really protects me. I typically miss a spot on the backs on my arms, and when I come in from running that spot will be bright red and burnt every time, but the rest of me is fine! This stuff does not sweat off, and for those with allergies, the scent is extremely faint - most sunblocks make me sneeze like crazy, but I barely even notice this one. Would definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li> I have never been allergic to anything including sunscreens.  I used this product 2 days in a row and developed a terrible rash on my arms and legs (unfortunately it didn&#x27;t appear the first day).  The rash has persisted for almost 2 weeks so far.  This product implies that it is hypo allergenic with the big #1 dermatologist recommended on the label. I talked to Neutrogena and their response so far has been to offer me some coupons.  This has been a painful terrible experience.  I would not recommend you take a chance with this product.</li>
            <li> Has a clean smell, and I like the helioplex.  Looking forward to using it as a face sunscreen. Item true to description.</li>
            <li> This is the BEST sunblock on the market in my opinion. I have Eczema and and burn easily and most sunblocks irritate my skin a short time after applied. This sunblock does not irritate my skin at all and works great to keep the sun from burning my skin. I&#x27;m truly sold by Neutrogena skin products. HIGHLY RECOMMEND for anyone with allergies or sensitivity to skin products</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t use it as my everyday sunscreen because whenever I sweat it turns white and rubs off on whatever I touch (like my couch and the inside of the car door). But it works okay for days spent outdoors.</li>
            <li> Works very well.....my child is a swimmer, uses it year long.</li>
            <li> Best sunblock in the universe</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t stick to my hairy arms</li>
            <li> I recently spent 9 days in Puerto Rico and came home without a sunburn thanks to this stuff (plus other reasonable precautions, such as consistently wearing a hat). It&#x27;s also non-greasy and soaks in quickly.</li>
            <li> I purchased this recently because I needed a new bottle of sunblock for my kids (ages 1 &amp; 6).  I was going to buy the Neutrogena Wet Skin lotion but we go through a lot of sunscreen and I didn&#x27;t think that the little 3oz bottle would last us very long.  I also use Neutrogena Dry Touch Sunblock on my face, but wanted to find a sunblock I could use on my back/arms/etc... so it couldn&#x27;t be greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is great!  It says its fragrance free; I found that it has a very pleasant scent.  I won&#x27;t lie, I kind of miss the smell of baby sunblock, but this smells very good.  A little bit goes a long way so this bottle will last us probably half the summer.  It&#x27;s not very greasy so it&#x27;s something that I&#x27;m willing to use too.</li>
            <li> My son and I got sunburnt badly within 1 hour of applying on skin.  Terrible product.</li>
            <li> After using this sunscreen 3 times this summer and still getting severely burned each time, I have thrown the bottle in the garbage where it belongs. It doesn&#x27;t seem to provide ANY protection from the sun. Do yourself a favor and don&#x27;t bother with this product.</li>
            <li> I have very fair and sensitive skin.  I was looking for a sunscreen that would be strong enough to keep me from turning into a lobster but not be toxic to the skin.  I really don&#x27;t like the smell of other sunscreens but I put up with it because I am used to using whatever it takes to keep myself from burning.  I&#x27;ve taken this sunscreen to the beach, to Disneyland and on bike rides and it&#x27;s my best friend.  It goes on nicely and feels like you&#x27;ve rubbed lotion into your skin (it&#x27;s infused with lotion.)  Also, I really like the smell...which is an odd thing to say about sunscreen.  It has a lighter, milder smell to it and I really like it.  It&#x27;s done the job and I haven&#x27;t been burned with it on since.  (I usually reapply every 60-80 minutes if I&#x27;m in prolonged and direct sunlight.)  I would DEFINITELY recommend to anyone who needs a good reliable sunscreen that feels good and doesn&#x27;t smell like you jumped into a chemical plant&#x27;s pool.  Best ever, and this is coming from someone who&#x27;s had to use a LOT of sunscreen.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend and I are both extremely sensitive to the sun (he blisters and I get sun poisoning) which doesn&#x27;t work well since we are very outdoorsy people. We went on a float trip a few weeks ago and tried neutrogena beach defense 70 spf lotion. It was wonderful! We were in the sun and water from 9am to 4:30pm. Only reapplied once. Didn&#x27;t even get a burn! Needless to say we are sticking with this sunscreen!</li>
            <li> Great for the islands ..Where its always hot..</li>
            <li> Smells good and keeps my white, white.</li>
