            <li>Love the relaxing scent of lavender plus it is so pretty.  </li>
            <li>I really just want to say, I love these Lavender petals.</li>
            <li>Also good mixed into potpourri mixes.</li>
            <li>I like to  inhale some of the steam as it gives me a very relaxed feeling and also helps me sleep better.</li>
            <li>It is clean, fresh and makes me feel like I&#x27;m again in a country garden.</li>
            <li>So it&#x27;s time to get back to nature and try something basic I grew up with herbs and wildflowers and almost forgot how wonderful they are and the benefits they carry.</li>
            <li>The smell is amazing as soon as you open the bag and lasts.</li>

            <li>I place in my dresser drawers, under my pillows to enable me to relax and get to sleep and many other uses.</li>
            <li>I use it mainly for the aroma in my apartment.</li>
            <li>I gave a four star rating because the lavender was not as strong as I thought it would be, but I&#x27;ve mixed other essential oils with it to achieve the fragrance I want.</li>

            <li> Bought this to make soap. Had to remove the little twigs with a tweezer. Took me about 4 hours, maybe it&#x27;s the aromatherapy that calmed me down, allowing me to complete the tedious job. Not sure whether I want to do it again! Found a tiny yellow flower and a teeny snail as well.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time! Smells great! Thank you!</li>
            <li> not much lavendar scent</li>
            <li> wish it came in a resealable bag, but still great product.</li>
            <li> Fresh and very fragrant</li>

            <li> Fresh, fragrant, and just the perfect moisture level for tea/smoking/cooking.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so sad! Wanted this for soap but I can&#x27;t use it. It has a lot of little sticks in it!</li>
            <li> Beautiful lavender flowers. Promptly shipped &amp; very healthy! I am anxious to put together an a arthritis remedy which requires in part lavender flowers. I will buy again as they don&#x27;t grow well in my climate! Love them!  I will candy some of the flowers  to top my cakes &amp; cupcakes!</li>
            <li> Smells absolutely divine.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t even bother opening the bag and just trashed it. Had more twigs and junk in it than actual flowers.</li>
            <li> Not for soap! little sticks  mixed in with the lavender flowers.</li>
            <li> Product exactly as expected. Used this for some bath bombs I made. Great smelling.</li>
            <li> My order contained quite a few twigs. I do not recommend.</li>
            <li> It smells amazing! Before I even opened the bag I could smell it. Comes in a ziplock, packaged great. Overall great stuff.</li>
            <li> It took forever to get to me. When what I thought was my lavender showed up....it ended up being some &amp;#34;as seen on t.v.&amp;#34; miracle socks and a miniature stylus.....very odd....very disappointed.  Will not be using this seller again.</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for. These smell so wonderful. I use them to make oil infusions for soap and they are perfect</li>
            <li> I really just want to say, I love these Lavender petals. The smell is amazing as soon as you open the bag and lasts. I use in most of my products for decoration and to infuse oils.

            <li> Got them in a timely manner and it smells fabulous!</li>
            <li> exactly as advertised.  I used it on a dessert and it was divine</li>
            <li> fresh ad super fragrant, love mine</li>
            <li> Great service and wonderful product!</li>
            <li> Use lots of this in homemade products. Love the relaxing scent of lavender plus it is so pretty.  Also good mixed into potpourri mixes.</li>
            <li> the lavender was fresh and plenty of it.  excellent customer service !</li>
            <li> I am tired of chemical sprays that are supposed to bring a fresh scent into my place. So it&#x27;s time to get back to nature and try something basic I grew up with herbs and wildflowers and almost forgot how wonderful they are and the benefits they carry. This lavender flower is really more than I expected. I use it mainly for the aroma in my apartment. Just put a handful of the buds into a pot of boiling water and after a few minuted, the scent spreads throughout my whole place. It is clean, fresh and makes me feel like I&#x27;m again in a country garden. After a few minutes, I put it&lt;br /&gt;down to simmer. I like to  inhale some of the steam as it gives me a very relaxed feeling and also helps me sleep better. I recommend it to anybody who is looking for a more natural way of relaxing, especially  at the end of the day!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe how fragrant these buds are I smelled them before I even opened the box ! Thank you!!</li>
            <li> Smelled great and worked well in my project.</li>
            <li> I gave a four star rating because the lavender was not as strong as I thought it would be, but I&#x27;ve mixed other essential oils with it to achieve the fragrance I want. Other than that I love it! Would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> The lavender is very fragrant.  It is easy to work with.  I have used it in bath salts. The bag seemed small, but it is workable</li>
            <li> Arrived on time,  great quality herbs.  Very happy with my purchase.  Thank you so much.</li>
            <li> Received item in a timely manner... used these to make lavender sachets, fits the bill.</li>
            <li> The quantity and quality of this lavender was perfect for the rice bags that I make to ease peoples aches and pains.&lt;br /&gt;When heated in the microwave the fragrance of this lavender is very soothing.</li>
            <li> The lavender was perfect.  Great quality product.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used these yet however in the package they smell amazing!</li>
            <li> Oh man these are great!!! They came and there were a whole bunch of them and they smell amazing! Can&#x27;t wait to make incense with these!</li>
            <li> Order arrived quickly and was a sizable amount for a great price. I saved the info to use this supplier in the future.</li>
            <li> The scent is so relaxing I place in my dresser drawers, under my pillows to enable me to relax and get to sleep and many other uses. Item arrived on time and in excellent condition.</li>
            <li> I purchase this because I like lavender smell, however this doesn&#x27;t smell anything. My friend gave me a bag of lavender flower last year, and it still smells great.</li>
            <li> Got my lavender asap thx</li>
