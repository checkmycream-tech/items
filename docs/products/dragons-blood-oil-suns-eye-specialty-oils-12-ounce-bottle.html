            <li>Love it for sure!</li>
            <li>I love the herbs in them which shows how potent they are!</li>
            <li>The scent is nice and interesting but it is not in any way the scent of Dragon&#x27;s Blood.  </li>
            <li>I love love love this scent!</li>
            <li>Love the smell and the natural oil made it perfect.</li>
            <li>I love the Wiccan Altar oil as well.  </li>
            <li>This has always been my favorite oil....</li>
            <li>The price is excellent, since I only use 3 drops of the oil at a time.  </li>
            <li>and I just love it.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>I chose this product because I love the smell of dragon&#x27;s blood incense.</li>
            <li>Then, it transforms into this earthy, exotic fragrance.</li>
            <li>The shipping was super fast and the oil smells amazing!!</li>
            <li>If you need to clear something out of your way or you want to have a nice fragrance to wear this is good for both issues.</li>
            <li>This blend of Dragons Blood oil is my absolute favorite!  </li>
            <li>Very strong smelling but is exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>But most notably, Dragon&#x27;s Blood oil is like the smell of a pack of hippies or how a bunch of oils and incenses mingle together in a new age/head shop.  </li>
            <li>and we&#x27;re never disappointed.</li>
            <li>This Dragon&#x27;s Blood is clean.</li>
            <li>so that is cool.  </li>
            <li>Every person that comes into my office comments on how good it smells, I have finally had to buy it in bulk to give out as gifts.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll make it quick...</li>
            <li>When first applied, it smells super sweet.</li>
            <li>I use it for cleaning around the house and to douse candles before burning, leaves a wonderful aroma behind.</li>
            <li>I smells okay, but it&#x27;s too sweet to be anything like Cinnabar, which is what Dragon&#x27;s Blood actually is.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also good for making spritzers, which don&#x27;t linger quite as long as the straight oil.</li>
            <li>Terrific fragrance, not a fan of the name much too nice for that.  </li>
            <li>Get ready for some REAL MAGICK!!</li>
            <li>it smells so good like an little flowers dancing on my skin..</li>
            <li>this is my second favorite oil by Sun&#x27;s Eye.  </li>
            <li>Wow!!!!</li>
            <li>I ordered this to use in my warming tray and so far not disappointed.</li>
            <li>It certainly does not smell like dragons blood.  </li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>this is very interesting as it has small bits of dragon&#x27;s blood resin in the oil.  </li>
            <li>This has a very synthetic smell to it and isn&#x27;t at all what I was expecting.</li>
            <li>I have tried several scented oils and found that this one fit the bill.  </li>
            <li>Delivery was reasonable.  </li>
            <li>The oil was very watery and smells like soap - not like Dragons Blood.  </li>
            <li>I will now feel confident to try other Sun&#x27;s Eye oils!</li>
            <li>Dragon Blood is use mainly for protection as well an balance</li>
            <li>It is sweet and roughly tangy, resin-y and very like incense.  </li>
            <li>Good, just not great value.</li>
            <li>Any blemishes I now get heal very quickly and don&#x27;t leave a dark spot.  </li>
            <li>I believe, but don&#x27;t know for sure, actual raw Dragon&#x27;s Blood resin from the tree doesn&#x27;t have much of a smell without being burned as incense, so</li>
            <li>, I am a professional psychic medium and burn it in my office all of the time for psychic protection.  </li>
            <li>Dragon&#x27;s Blood, It&#x27;s better than the other brands, the smell is different from other brands I&#x27;ve tried, also the shipping is fast and has been reliable.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve bought other brands before and they just didn&#x27;t smell right.  </li>
            <li>Subtle blend that I enjoy for personal scent and for room scent.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> Smells accurate, but it is quite expensive for such a tiny amount...</li>
            <li> The oil smells slightly different from the incense, and lingers a long time, so a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little on a tissue will last weeks in an enclosed space!</li>

            <li> It seems to be made of quality oils/materials, it doesn&#x27;t have a fake chemically smell, and there are little flecks of actual Dragon&#x27;s Blood resin in there</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m not sure if i like this or not.  </li>
            <li> The scent of this oil is hard to explain.  </li>
            <li> I ordered this product to make Dragon&#x27;s Blood soap with, and it&#x27;s really not very good.</li>
            <li> I also use it to dab a small amount on a tissue and place in the bathroom as a air freshener, and in the car!!!</li>

            <li> I ordered to compare with other Dragons Blood oils. I like this one the best! There is a premium quality to it. I will now feel confident to try other Sun&#x27;s Eye oils!</li>
            <li> Not even close to smelling like Dragon Blood.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product to make Dragon&#x27;s Blood soap with, and it&#x27;s really not very good. I smells okay, but it&#x27;s too sweet to be anything like Cinnabar, which is what Dragon&#x27;s Blood actually is. NOT a fan.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS OIL WORKS GREAT</li>
            <li> Dragon&#x27;s Blood, It&#x27;s better than the other brands, the smell is different from other brands I&#x27;ve tried, also the shipping is fast and has been reliable. Thanks</li>
            <li> The shipping was super fast and the oil smells amazing!! Thank you!</li>
            <li> The scent of this oil is hard to explain.  It is sweet and roughly tangy, resin-y and very like incense.  There is an almond extract smell off the bat but that could be the carrier oil?  But most notably, Dragon&#x27;s Blood oil is like the smell of a pack of hippies or how a bunch of oils and incenses mingle together in a new age/head shop.  Probably we have a you-like-it-or-you-don&#x27;t situation.  Or not, since I&#x27;m on the fence.  It seems to be made of quality oils/materials, it doesn&#x27;t have a fake chemically smell, and there are little flecks of actual Dragon&#x27;s Blood resin in there so that is cool.  I believe, but don&#x27;t know for sure, actual raw Dragon&#x27;s Blood resin from the tree doesn&#x27;t have much of a smell without being burned as incense, so I think Sun&#x27;s Eye has attempted to reproduce the essence of the burning resin with a variety of scents(meaning the odor doesn&#x27;t come from the flecks of DB in there).  The three-star rating is based on my personal reaction to the scent and doesn&#x27;t necessarily reflect the quality of the oil.  If you know you like the scent, then this does seem to be of quality.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m not sure if i like this or not.  i&#x27;ve been looking for the &#x27;perfect&#x27; dragon&#x27;s blood oil.  this is very interesting as it has small bits of dragon&#x27;s blood resin in the oil.  the scent isn&#x27;t something i hate or enjoy...it kinda just &#x27;is&#x27;.  it&#x27;s almost in a sense of a resin-like cola smell.</li>
            <li> this is my second favorite oil by Sun&#x27;s Eye.  I love the Wiccan Altar oil as well.  It is amazing the smell is intoxicating .</li>
            <li> This is some carrier oil (almond?) with some minute amount of powdered dragon&#x27;s blood resin floating around in it.  It certainly does not smell like dragons blood.  When left sitting the powder settles at the bottom.</li>
            <li> I purchased a cream from another vender with Dragon&#x27;s Oil so I thought I&#x27;d try the oil itself. Wow!!!! I use it in the morning and evening on my face and neck and see wonderful results. My skin is softer and my skin texture is smoother. Any blemishes I now get heal very quickly and don&#x27;t leave a dark spot.  I used to have to wait 3 months before the spot disappeared and now it&#x27;s gone immediately after healing.  My skeptical daughter tried it on a blemish and it healed right away.  I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s in this specialty oil, but please don&#x27;t change it because I&#x27;m always going to order Dragon&#x27;s Blood Oil!</li>
            <li> This blend of Dragons Blood oil is my absolute favorite!  It smells so good, I am a professional psychic medium and burn it in my office all of the time for psychic protection.  Every person that comes into my office comments on how good it smells, I have finally had to buy it in bulk to give out as gifts.</li>

            <li> This oil is just what I was looking for.  Love the smell and the natural oil made it perfect. I have tried several scented oils and found that this one fit the bill.  the scent is NOT overpowering!  Love it for sure!</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with this oil, will order again!</li>
            <li> The oil smells slightly different from the incense, and lingers a long time, so a little bit goes a long way. It&#x27;s good for use in places where burning incense isn&#x27;t practical:  cars, cube farm at work, etc. A little on a tissue will last weeks in an enclosed space! It&#x27;s also good for making spritzers, which don&#x27;t linger quite as long as the straight oil.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll make it quick... great service, great products, because Sun&#x27;s Eye is the best essential oils around!! I love the herbs in them which shows how potent they are! Get ready for some REAL MAGICK!!</li>
            <li> Love the smell of this oil! You only need a small amount if placed on your skin and it smells all day long. I also use it to dab a small amount on a tissue and place in the bathroom as a air freshener, and in the car!!! It is a free spirit, \\&quot;flower girl\\&quot; kind of smell!!!</li>
            <li> Dragon Blood is use mainly for protection as well an balance well being it brings out the natural aspect to what it is used for ,Since I am unable to use it directly on my skin I mix in some hand lotion the Aroma is amazing it smells so good like an little flowers dancing on my skin.. This has always been my favorite oil.... Anyone that hasn&#x27;t tried this should. Thank You</li>
            <li> The scent is nice and interesting but it is not in any way the scent of Dragon&#x27;s Blood.  Great smell but it is not the scent</li>
            <li> Beautiful scent, a fairly hefty amount of oil.&lt;br /&gt;Very pleased :)</li>
            <li> Just wish it came in bigger sizes. Smells accurate, but it is quite expensive for such a tiny amount... Good, just not great value.</li>
            <li> I use this oil in my aroma oil diffuser in my office.  It is a quality product.  The price is excellent, since I only use 3 drops of the oil at a time.  The scent promotes relaxation and thought.</li>
            <li> Subtle blend that I enjoy for personal scent and for room scent.  A couple of drops on the dogs bed is a nice touch also.</li>
            <li> This product has a nice scent in my room.  Delivery was reasonable.  I ordered this to use in my warming tray and so far not disappointed.</li>
            <li> this is perfect for all my formulas that i make with my oils and incense. i will order this again</li>

            <li> Awesome!  My husband wears this and I just love it.  We&#x27;ve bought other brands before and they just didn&#x27;t smell right.  This one is absolutely perfect!  I buy this same one every time he runs out and we&#x27;re never disappointed.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time, and packaged great.  The oil smells just like it is supposed too, wonderful product.  I use it for cleaning around the house and to douse candles before burning, leaves a wonderful aroma behind.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  The fragrance is awesome and really does the trick.  If you need to clear something out of your way or you want to have a nice fragrance to wear this is good for both issues.</li>
            <li> Wonderful diffusing oil.  And makes a nice perfume.  I am looking forward to using this oil in my face products.</li>
            <li> I love love love this scent! Please never stop making it! I wish there was incense that smelled just like this, too!</li>
            <li> I chose this product because I love the smell of dragon&#x27;s blood incense. This oil smells like incense! When first applied, it smells super sweet. Then, it transforms into this earthy, exotic fragrance. I wear it on occasion and people ask what I am wearing. A little goes a long way. What great value for money!</li>
            <li> Very strong smelling but is exactly what I wanted. Works great. I will definitely buy again. Very Easy to use.</li>
            <li> Terrific fragrance, not a fan of the name much too nice for that.  When people asked what I&#x27;m wearing I just say I can&#x27;t remember.</li>
            <li> This does work great !</li>
            <li> This Dragon&#x27;s Blood is clean.</li>
