            <li>This made my curls look beautiful</li>
            <li>Imagine my dismay when bath time (11AM) featuring beautiful curls, morphed into a brillo pad upon waking from his nap (3PM).</li>

            <li>It comes out beautiful.  </li>

            <li>and my frizz was in great control</li>

            <li>It smells great.</li>
            <li>It gives me great definition and keeps my hair moisturized, but doesn&#x27;t provide hold like a gel would.</li>

            <li>This has been a really good leave-in for me during the colder months</li>
            <li>After two weeks I gave up on Cantu for good.</li>
            <li>After washing my hair I take a good scoop out, and massage it in my hair.</li>
            <li>It is really good to condition your hair.</li>
            <li>bring a comb with you will be a good decision</li>
            <li>It smells SO good...</li>
            <li>and I loved it.</li>
            <li>I LOVED this stuff as a leave-in but after two weeks I noticed that it was drying out my 3C hair.  </li>

            <li>It smells amazing like vanilla-coconut</li>
            <li>It smells amazing.</li>
            <li>AMAZING PRODUCT A MUST HAVE.</li>
            <li>, here&#x27;s what Cantu&#x27;s leave-in conditioner does for my hair: It goes on real smooth.</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing to me &amp; my daughter&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li>Smells amazing.</li>
            <li>The results are amazing.</li>
            <li>Today my hair is amazing.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my curls smooth and shiny and smells great too.</li>
            <li>I got this product at an amazing price</li>

            <li>Absolute best!</li>
            <li>However, if you are okay with having to re-twist to keep your twist out-then I would say Cantu leave in is a superior product.</li>
            <li>After reading all the good reviews I thought I would love it.</li>
            <li>Honestly, this product just sits on my hair.</li>
            <li>Makes hair nice and moist.</li>
            <li>Both of m sisters said that they really liked cantu, so I went online</li>
            <li>It felt nice and creamy.</li>
            <li>I rake it through my hair and it defines my curls nicely</li>
            <li>and it has a nice smell.</li>
            <li>It has a nice dewy scent and doesn&#x27;t have that heavy-perfume aroma; the smell is resemblance of the tropics with a hint of coconut.</li>
            <li>Your hair will feel Super-soft; having that truly conditioned feeling/healthy look and leave hair with a nice minty scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this product, it smells so good and leaves my hair nice and</li>
            <li>But My request is to make sure of the carrier company that it delivers the packages in good condition...</li>
            <li>Am relaxed and I use it to moisturize nightly and seal with Rose oil and wrap my hair with a silk scarf and let me tell you all I do in the a.m. is unwrap and style.</li>
            <li>Absolutely the best...</li>
            <li>...it leaves some kind of residue if you try to mix with another product.</li>
            <li>It is very moisturizing and smells great!</li>

            <li>A+ :)</li>
            <li>The smell is phenomenal as well, coconut and shea butter.</li>
            <li>This stuff smells awesome and it adds extra moisture.</li>
            <li>Then I slather on the Cantu leave-in conditioning cream liberally by running through with my fingers in sections on top, and then run my fingers through underneath, keeping the part where I want it.</li>
            <li>have used many products on my hair from the cheaper Africa&#x27;s Best, to Carol&#x27;s Daughter, to Mixed Chicks and also Miss Jessie&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>have used many products on my hair from the cheaper Africa&#x27;s Best, to Carol&#x27;s Daughter, to Mixed Chicks and also Miss Jessie&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>I leave it in over night under a hair cap once every week, and I have noticed that I don&#x27;t have as many split ends</li>
            <li>I love this product for my daughters&#x27; 3c and 4b hair.</li>
            <li>I find that my hair is much more manageable and styles hold better when I use this product.  </li>
            <li>and I absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li>Simply the best.</li>
            <li>Better off with something else.</li>
            <li>I get so many compliments when I use it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a year now, and I&#x27;ve finally figured out the best way to use it (for me anyway).  </li>
            <li>It came a day earlier than predicted which is awesome!</li>
            <li>I love to use this leave in conditioner..</li>
            <li>So I was on the hunt for something better.</li>
            <li>It just felt like I putting product that just sat on top of my hair.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve got to say this cream is awesome for any dude (or chick) with a hair type similar to mine who doesn&#x27;t like spending more than 10 min in the bathroom styling their mane.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>and I love how creamy it is.</li>
            <li>I had to keep re-apply more product just to have that softness I was hoping to achieve.</li>
            <li>Works best when your constantly doing wash and go&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>No awful smells either</li>
            <li>help keep your hair healthy</li>
            <li>I love this product, however when I received it yesterday, the lid had come off of one of the jars, and both jars were covered with product.  </li>
            <li>Thankfully it was encased in a plastic bag, and I was able to collect most of the product.  </li>
            <li>: Okay, I just have to add this...</li>
            <li>I bought this as my Christmas gift from my guy, and he even said that my hair looks a lot better.</li>
            <li>I am in love with the smell.</li>

            <li>I LOVE THIS PRODUCT.</li>
            <li>I love the way this product smells.  </li>

            <li>Works OK.</li>
            <li>After reading the many reviews I thought I would give it a shot</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>It soothes the dryness, detangles and helps some with the frizz - not a miracle for that, but better than it&#x27;s been.  </li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>Have recommended it to many friends.</li>
            <li>Love everything about it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>okay.  </li>
            <li>I love to scoop and slather</li>
            <li>but still it won&#x27;t come out, I have to squeeze hard.&lt;br /&gt;Cantu, one more star for its ease of use.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t stop touching</li>
            <li>but I still could not get anything meaningful..</li>
            <li>the shampoo worked magic for my hair..</li>
            <li>and I was able to comb as if I had conditioned it.</li>
            <li>I love my cantu products..</li>
            <li>I love my cantu products..</li>
            <li>so you get the most out of it.</li>
            <li>I love it, love it</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>Even with the ingredient change (I remember shea butter being #2 on the list), I still love this conditioner most.</li>
            <li>Purchased many times over.</li>
            <li>Hair feels very well conditioned and great shine to it.</li>
            <li>(focus mostly on the ends)</li>
            <li>I do have to heat it up by sitting under a hooded dryer as I have low porosity hair, but it works wonderfully and my hair feels nourished</li>
            <li>LOVE  </li>
            <li>and I already recommended it to my mom :)</li>

            <li>I&#x27;ve had much better results with Elasta QP Olive oil &amp; Mango</li>
            <li>My hair loves it and therefore I love it.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>

            <li>overall i ,love this product and will keep using it!!!</li>

            <li>It came out soft and shiny and beautiful.</li>
            <li>Loved it, has a great scent that lasts but is not too strong, and the product lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>but i&#x27;m excited!</li>
            <li>I love this product and strongly recommend it.</li>
            <li>The only good thing I have to say about this product is that it smells good.</li>
            <li>Overall though, its a good product for sealing in &amp; moisturizing the hair no matter how u use it, &amp; a good product for the price(not this price, though).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The Cantu leave in conditioner is great for moisture and it leaves my hair very soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>Sensational for very curly hair!</li>
            <li>great product still use to this day and im going natural so its a great product for those ladies who are thinking of going natural or are already doing so.</li>
            <li>This is a great conditioner- makes my hair so soft.</li>
            <li>OMG i am so glad that i did because it is fantastic.</li>
            <li>My hair looks very healthy and bouncy even after using hot appliances.</li>
            <li>its a great leave in for natural hair</li>
            <li>I leaves my hair soft and manageable and it smells great.</li>
            <li>It smells great and it keeps my kinky coils hydrated and soft.</li>
            <li>Bought this product from my local pharmacy for my incredibly damaged 4a/4b hair.</li>
            <li>Ive got 4c texturised hair, I love this product, very moisturizing and nourishing, leaves hair soft, best leave in</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s mineral oil free (excellent), it leaves dry hair moisturized and manageable.  </li>
            <li>After endless trial and error I came across this wonderful, god-sent leave in conditioner.</li>
            <li>I instantly liked it because I felt like I finally was getting somewhere with good products.  </li>
            <li>the smell is also strong.</li>
            <li>If you are bothered by strong scents then you might want to overlook this product.</li>
            <li>the cantu shea butter grow strong treatment.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not at all sticky when it dries, so many of the &amp;#34;leave in&amp;#34; products feel stiff or oily, but the Cantu Shea Butter is awesome.</li>
            <li>Its soo good to find products that good soo early on my journey which makes going natural easy!</li>
            <li>This is my first purchase of any Cantu products and this one is AMAZING.</li>
            <li>Anyone who wants a good conditioner thats not greasy and smells great, Look no further you have found it.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t leave any residue, not stiff and the smell is pleasant.</li>
            <li>but I didn&#x27;t pay attention to the fine print</li>
            <li>i do get the best results when hair is slightly damp.</li>
            <li>always had hair that once relaxed, it was fine</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have any build up from this product, BUT my hair is incredibly damaged and dry</li>
            <li>Doing this adds volume so I have a fuller, more rounded shape, and it dries the curls quickly.</li>
            <li>Doing this adds volume so I have a fuller, more rounded shape, and it dries the curls quickly.</li>
            <li>This is a really good product for bringing out the natural curl pattern in your hair!  </li>
            <li>They put it in after washing their hair and then on days when they don&#x27;t wash their hair, they just comb a little through and it works great!</li>
            <li>I have used many popular products and none kept my hair soft and moisturized pass a couple of days.</li>
            <li>This fit the job.</li>
            <li>Its also great for gel styling to add extra moisture.</li>
            <li>This stuff is light weight but does the job.</li>
            <li>It is also fantastic for bleached hair as I am experimenting with blond color now</li>
            <li>the texture is smooth and creamy like lotion.</li>
            <li>It is great for after shampoo usage, color treated hair or after relaxed hair; it does not matter the outcome it has the same level of consistency each and every time.</li>
            <li>I just want something to put in it to smooth it out some and moisturize it, which I think I&#x27;ve found in this.</li>
            <li>Overall a great leave in for natural/transitioning hair.</li>
            <li>if you want silky shiny light stuff, this is not it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Hair is softer, shines and almost frizz free.</li>
            <li>Once my hair dries it is soft and manageable and smells really good.</li>
            <li>Nice leave in for natural hair not my favorite, but does the job of moisturizing my 3c hair.</li>
            <li>For the longest time  i have been looking for a product that smells good and keeps my natural hair moist, and Cantu does the job.</li>
            <li>I have curly hair and find that with Cantu leave in conditioner my hair stays soft, moisturized, and smelling really good.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I will say out of the various Cantu products I smelled in the store this company is consistent with having a nice, pleasant scent with their products.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s best to put the Cantu Shea Butter on first and let your hair dry up to 80% then apply curling or twisting product.</li>
            <li>I love to use this after washing my hair and right before a twist out.</li>
            <li>It is best used on wet or damp hair and with perhaps a little castor oil or oil of your choice to kind of blend it in more and make sure</li>
            <li>And when we first start this natural hair journey, we run out and buy all of them (getting caught up in the hype, lol).</li>
            <li>great for natural hair and is much cheaper online than in stores!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a product junkie and am constantly trying new products to find the best ones.</li>
            <li>just wanted to add to my original review.</li>
            <li>But I stick by my original review of this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a year or more and the results have been consistent.</li>
            <li>my hair is pretty healthy.</li>
            <li>I fell in love with it since the first time I tried it.</li>
            <li>One contains a higher concentration and many websites have that image and ingredient list even though they are shipping the one with a lower concentration of shea</li>
            <li>it is the best for hair like mine (very fine, very soft, porous, tightly coiled hair).</li>
            <li>This stuff is GREAT, so nourishing, if your hair is dry you need this.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair soft and shiny and more healthy.</li>
            <li>I recently transitioned from relaxed to natural hair, and this shea butter produces the best twist-outs!</li>
            <li>I recently started caring for my hair and this moisturizer is good stuff.</li>
            <li>There are so many products on the market, promising all types of results.</li>
            <li>I get nice soft curls when I twist with it--more like curls instead of waves.</li>
            <li>(I later discovered the miracle of good heat protectors).</li>
            <li>I use it all the time, I love it so much</li>
            <li>I had heard so much about Cantu products and I&#x27;m so glad I gave it a try.</li>
            <li>Smells good but leaves a white residue on the hair when it dries.  </li>
            <li>I am currently loving Cantu natural hair products.</li>
            <li>It smells good enough to eat.</li>
            <li>This was such a good deal</li>
            <li>Fresh smelling, light souffle texture.  </li>
            <li>After covering it with a plastic bag for a good ten minutes</li>
            <li>my hair is full and gets frizzy when the weather is damp and shit.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Nothing has treated my hair better, absolutely nothing.</li>
            <li>LOVE this product so much.</li>
            <li>Odie el olor, me produce nauseas, no lo tolere aunque al cabello le cae super bien.</li>
            <li>However, if you&#x27;re looking for a great leave-in you can absolutely use alone (or in deep conditioners, or as a detangler, a wash-out conditioner, &amp; more)that leaves no waxiness or residue</li>
            <li>He has a Beautiful long tail (which doesn&#x27;t come about very often)</li>
            <li>I live by the stuff!!!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a new curly girl and still not sure exactly which products work best in my hair, but I decided to try this product because so many people swear by it.  </li>
            <li>I find that this mix of Cantu products is the best I&#x27;ve found so far, for so much cheaper than the ones I&#x27;ve mentioned above.</li>
            <li>I find that this mix of Cantu products is the best I&#x27;ve found so far, for so much cheaper than the ones I&#x27;ve mentioned above.</li>
            <li>It works in the hot Georgia Summer heat to keep my hair moisturized and frizz free.</li>
            <li>Helps to reduce breakage on hair ends.&lt;br /&gt;Cons-causes build up and flakes when used with other products.&lt;br /&gt;Nevertheless its an excellent conditioner for natural hair.</li>
            <li>Really easy to scoop the thing out in large amount.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>product is great holds the hair down</li>
            <li>This product is great in black hair.</li>
            <li>Would 100% recommend for curly, dry, chemically damaged, ethnic hair as part of a good hair care routine.</li>
            <li>First, let me begin by saying, O.MGOSH!</li>
            <li>and I know in a month or two I am gonna be even more head over heels with my natural hair!</li>
            <li>and I know in a month or two I am gonna be even more head over heels with my natural hair!</li>
            <li>Hello everyone, I am a transitioning african-american mixed, I love this product!</li>
            <li>and that&#x27;s exactly where it went!  </li>
            <li>I was excited to use this because of all the great reviews, I am turning into a product junky, trying to find the best product for my hair - low porousity, coarse, thick</li>
            <li>The more cream I use, the more defined the curls are when they dry, but they also aren&#x27;t crispy at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This product will give most naturals super soft, touchable hair.</li>
            <li>It dries light on your hair, but is very moisturizing.</li>
            <li>Since it is sulfate free, it doesn&#x27;t lather up much.</li>
            <li>than those few cons its a great product</li>
            <li>It has been since Nov 2013 since I had a touch-up and the outgrowth is smooth, hydrated, frizz-free, the relaxed hair is unscathed from the intense moisture punch</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s definitely worth trying.</li>
            <li>But, cantu is worth a try if you are battling dryness.</li>
            <li>cantu is one of my favorite lines for natural hair</li>
            <li>Ok im a natural girl.</li>
            <li>It came fast and as expected the product was Great....</li>
            <li>love it makes here soft</li>
            <li>I love this product on my natural hair.</li>
            <li>fresh</li>
            <li>far better job than conditioner or oil.  </li>
            <li>Well eventually I started to do my own hair and experiment with different products and techniques.</li>
            <li>This is one of my favorite leave in conditioners, using it leaves my hair soft and silky.</li>
            <li>It has a very pleasant light scent that lingers but doesn&#x27;t bother me as I am not too sensitive to fragrances; it has a creamy somewhat thick consistency that melts into my hair as I apply</li>
            <li>Got this yesterday and used it right away.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been struggling with trying to get the right products for my hair</li>
            <li>and now I feel like I&#x27;m headed in the right direction .</li>
            <li>But once i put this in my hair, I seal it with organic extra virgin coconut oil, &amp; hair is strong and soft &amp; smells nice.</li>
            <li>It is a heavier product so Co-washing is a good way to keep down on flakes or build-up.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair soft and easy to comb through.</li>
            <li>This keeps my hair soft and easy to comb.</li>
            <li>The grow strong and leave in repair creams made my hair really soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>its now soft, has no knots, easy to comb or twist, looks and feels well moisturized</li>
            <li>its now soft, has no knots, easy to comb or twist, looks and feels well moisturized</li>
            <li>My hair grew a lot more and was way more manageable then before, I have very curly hair, if i did my hair in the morning I would have tangles and knots by the afternoon, I recommend this product to everyone that want&#x27;s to keep there curls in check and the great thing is it cuts down time when I air dry, make sure you apply this product everywhere and make little curls with your finger.</li>
            <li>so it does not look frizzy nice texture not stiff easy to use thru the day after using in AM wet and reshape on the go&lt;</li>
            <li>/&gt;I am very very satisfied.&lt;br</li>
            <li>texture is very much like body</li>
            <li>First time ever using shea butter and conditioner definitely works treats and helps my hair very very well glad</li>
            <li>I will definitely get more.</li>
            <li>Obviously some products will work better for some than for others.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>They are pretty defined.</li>
            <li>They are pretty defined.</li>
            <li>and I also don&#x27;t shed as much!</li>
            <li>I have tried many different products on my bi-racial kids hair but nothing seemed to keep the moisture in their hair.  </li>
            <li>This will likely stay in my product list until I find better.</li>
            <li>I have this set up to ship every 3 months or so and its more than enough.</li>
            <li>I use this product for my braidouts and twistouts with fabulously consistent results.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff, I bought it after I did my big chop 5 months ago.  </li>
            <li>and I cannot express enough how much I love this product.</li>
            <li>I recommend following up with this product after you use the Motions Moisture Plus; the two are safe to use together or by itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>then I had when I first used the product.</li>
            <li>Made hair soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>The first time I used this product, it didn&#x27;t saturate my hair like I need too.</li>
            <li>Honestly, I&#x27;ve never tried a great conditioning cream like Cantu&#x27;s..</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve read many reviews that said they were left with flakes and residue.  </li>
            <li>First, let me explain the product.</li>
            <li>And at first, you might want to just slather it on, and just let your hair absorb it.</li>
            <li>hair butter (once or twice I&#x27;ve used ECO styling gel on top of the butter/milk/styler) and have never had problems with flakes or had white balls of product</li>
            <li>Even Garnier&#x27;s LIC, surprisingly, left my hair more malleable and moisturized than Cantu&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>I am a product junkie who can&#x27;t resist trying the latest deep conditioners, oils, and shampoos for my curly hair.</li>
            <li>, I tried it on my daughters hair and its great for them, so at least I dont have to throw it out</li>
            <li>This was the first leave in that I started using for my transition.</li>
            <li>I recently tried this product and I love it.</li>
            <li>I tried olive oil products and many different greasy ethnic hair products.</li>
            <li>If you stick with this leave in conditioner you will most definitely reap the benefits.</li>
            <li>I was fooled for the first two weeks.  </li>
            <li>I have used this product several times since purchasing it and am pleased.</li>
            <li>It is exactly as described.</li>
            <li>Defining Creme Glaze which also did a pretty fantastic job adding moisture and afterwards my hair was shiny and soft.</li>
            <li>Great for thick and curly hair.</li>
            <li>It tames all the frizzes and leaves your hair soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>After just the first application I noticed a difference.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s okay, no big deal.  </li>
            <li>In the few days I&#x27;ve had it, it&#x27;s been really good.</li>
            <li>I now use this product mostly as an ingredient in my own deep conditioner concoction (which includes other conditioners, coconut &amp; olive oil, honey, etc.)</li>
            <li>I did my big chop and was very excited..</li>
            <li>the ones that say \\&quot;shea soft\\&quot; instead of \\&quot;shea butter\\&quot; up top seem to have the same ingredients as the containers which omit \\&quot;made with pure shea butter.\\&quot;</li>
            <li>My first and favorite natural hair product by far.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very affordable and I love that I can buy it from my local drugstore/ beauty supply store.</li>
            <li>I bought this conditioner on the reccommendation of three websites--which reccommended a good moisturizer for African American course hair (like mine).  </li>
            <li>This leave in conditioner is just a MIRACLE it leaves your hair super soft and shiny !</li>
            <li>Repeat at least (2x&#x27;s a week); your hair will feel absolutely amazing!</li>
            <li>I keeps my hair long and healthy without feeling oily.</li>
            <li>It smells good, but I&#x27;m not really sure if it&#x27;s helping to do what it says it will do.</li>
            <li>It is very moisturizing and provides good slip, especially natural African American hair.  </li>
            <li>I bought this product and the very first use i literally could feel my hair becoming soft instantly as i massaged it into my hair.</li>
            <li>Go on, be generous with use, it will soak it right up with no thick greasy residue.</li>
            <li>The top dries flatter and the ends curl up and get thicker as they dry.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my hair feeling so super soft and my curls are as curly and defined as having Shirley Temple hair.</li>
            <li>but it just make my hair more dry.  </li>
            <li>It has a strong menthol scent and you can actually feel it tingling throughout your hair but isn&#x27;t overbearing on the scalp.</li>
            <li>The smell is pleasant and the consistency isn&#x27;t too thick</li>
            <li>Some containers of the \\&quot;Leave in Conditioner\\&quot; omit \\&quot;made with pure shea\\&quot; butter and those have shea butter as the #2 ingredient.</li>
            <li>the containers that have \\&quot;made with pure  </li>
            <li>And my hair is more fluffy than super defined.</li>
            <li>I used this product once and was pleasantly surprised as how soft his tail felt and how easily the tangles combed out.&lt;br /&gt;His</li>
            <li>bought Cantu Shea Butter (leave-in conditioning repair cream) after hearing these two females raving how much they love this product while shopping in the hair aisle at my local beauty supply store; as I have never tried Cantu products before I am always eager to try/learn new things.</li>
            <li>It smells really nice.. and keep my daughter hair moisturize and even enhance her curls a little ..</li>
            <li>Mellows it right out in a natural curl way!</li>
            <li>First time I put it on my hair, it left my edges really smooth and soft and most importantly, flat.</li>
            <li>The jar is huge and will last me for months and maybe even years!</li>
            <li>really soft\\</li>
            <li>For the life of me I do not know why people like this product so much.</li>
            <li>And don&#x27;t forget to try the LOC method, if dryness is really a problem for you.</li>
            <li>retention).is really a problem for you.</li>
            <li>I would really recommend my fav</li>
            <li>Since I&#x27;ve had that epiphany, I&#x27;ve been so much happer with my hair.</li>
            <li>I bend forward and gently scrunch my hair into the diffuser and hold the dryer still.</li>
            <li>I bend forward and gently scrunch my hair into the diffuser and hold the dryer still.</li>
            <li>It really moisturizes my hair well.</li>
            <li>My hair&#x27;s much softer than before.</li>
            <li>After one use my hair felt silky and had so much shine.</li>
            <li>This product however doesnt make my hair curl no matter how much i scrunch, it made my hair very stringy and puffy.</li>
            <li>highly highly recommend it for curly haired girls who need to condition and defrizz!</li>
            <li>so you&#x27;ll have to watch how much you use.</li>
            <li>There is too much wATER</li>
            <li>This leave-in conditioner really leaves my hair moisturized.</li>
            <li>I just don&#x27;t think it does much to help it either.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s cheap enough for you to give it a try.</li>
            <li>It has a light weight (about the consistency of regular hair conditioner), and doesn&#x27;t leave a waxy or oily residue in your hair.</li>
            <li>Fast service...*thumbs up</li>
            <li>I really like this.</li>
            <li>My hair absolutely loves this product.</li>
            <li>I even used this when I was transitioning and it made the 2 textures very manageable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It moisturized my hair very well.</li>
            <li>leaves my hair very moist.</li>
            <li>/&gt;the price is reasonable and the amount (16oz/2pk) is generous</li>
            <li>conditioners don&#x27;t really do anything for you anyway.</li>
            <li>I can really see the length of my hair now</li>
            <li>Thanks Cantu...</li>
            <li>I can really see the length of my hair now</li>
            <li>Thanks Cantu...</li>
            <li>start breaking off, this stuff helps a whole lot.</li>
            <li>It literally changed my whole hair routine.</li>
            <li>And after 3 years of curly girl techniques and cantu, my hair has really grown.</li>
            <li>would give the company a 5 for how fast it was shipped, but the package arrive with some of the product leaking out of the container.</li>
            <li>Now that I am further along in trying out products and my hair has more natural length...</li>
            <li>i use it daily in my natural hair for more moisture and it works.</li>
            <li>Works wonders in my seven year old daughters curly hair!!!</li>
            <li>The only thing good about cantu shea products are the prices, other than that they suck.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Now before going further into details I think it is important that you know my particular texture of hair.</li>
            <li>Definitely think its worth purchasing!</li>
            <li>I was excited to try it and couldn&#x27;t wait for my next wash/conditioning session at home in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was excited about the price, but personally I learned the &amp;#34;you get what you pay for&amp;#34</li>
            <li>I have tried other mostly organic products</li>
            <li>This product is amazing, I use it everyday and after a 2 weeks I notices my hair was a lot more moisturized and also had less split ends</li>
            <li>I only use it on clean, damp hair.</li>
            <li>use this as a rinse out conditioner as well as a leave-in treatment; Motions Moisture Plus product provides consistent results and is worth every cent; and for only a fraction of what one wouldpay for using Miss Jessie&#x27;s products.</li>
            <li>Even though my hair is pretty good, if it gets long, hitting mid back, it gets dry.&lt;br /&gt;Been</li>
            <li>Otherwise your hair will be full of white residue.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be sure to check back and adjust this review as deemed fit in a few months though.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so pleased with it, it really is better than anything else I&#x27;ve ever tried &amp; I&#x27;ve wasted so much money on just about every other product on the market.</li>
            <li>is laying down more</li>
            <li>The new formula didn&#x27;t work for me!</li>
            <li>Sometimes less is more.</li>
            <li>I suppose if you are one of those people who want super definition, and only want to twist once, and then pineapple for the rest of the week without having to re-twist, then Cantu won&#x27;t do that for you--because it has no hold.</li>
            <li>, I get a decent hold</li>
            <li>It fell short to leave my hair feeling, \\&quot;smooth or soft and/or manageable\\&quot; as its claim.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This product is like enough to provide adequate moisture.</li>
            <li>Main ingredient used to be shea butter.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried SO many products for help, wasted a lot of money, but this is really working.  </li>
            <li>I will try the custard again when she&#x27;s much older.</li>
            <li>Mainly because my mom used to do it.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;it was very light and not thick like the other Cantu Shea Butter for natural hair leave in conditioning i got from a store.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Another product I highly recommend&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I highly reccommend</li>
            <li>highly recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>It weighs my hair down a little, but I welcome it since I deal with shrinkage.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair really soft and very curly.  </li>
            <li>is moist and SOFT, plus much easier to manage.</li>
            <li>Keeps my hair soft &amp; straight.</li>
            <li>I love that it is not too heavy but can be used in abundance to help set my curls.</li>
            <li>I add some argan oil after the product has air dried and this eliminates most of the flakes even though it&#x27;s annoying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It cost only $4.49 and can be found at major hair supply stores; it is for at home care and has a great light feeling to the hair and scent without hidden dyes or harsh</li>
            <li>It does a good job at keeping my dry poofy hair under control, but I find that it leaves my hair a bit dried out.</li>
            <li>Other wise a white residue will be left on hair.</li>
            <li>, i wait longer then normal for perms , and i experience so much new growth</li>
            <li>Normally I do two strain twist adding leave-in condition, leave my hair very soft.</li>
            <li>What I received was the new formula in the new bottle.  </li>
            <li>New formula also has Mineral Oil in it.</li>
            <li>Miracle&#x27;s Healing Live in Treatment and Conditioner - This product doesn&#x27;t just condition ones hair</li>
            <li>The new formula does not work as well for my hair.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m AA with a 1.5yr of new growth.</li>
            <li>I applied to newly shampooed hair and did bantu knots.</li>
            <li>Though, Oil is good for settling down my hair and probably prevents further damage but didn&#x27;t really moisturize or improve dry</li>
            <li>no white residue - which later looks like huge dandruff flakes - remain on you hair.</li>
            <li>Instead my hair felt dry and limb; nor did the product absorb quickly.</li>
            <li>Adds more sture but leaves white film if hair is too wet</li>
            <li>After blow drying, my hair has a very soft texture and no split ends or fly-aways are visible.</li>
            <li>I bought his product because it came highly recommended from the woman in my natural hair</li>
            <li>my hair is very soft and somewhat shiny&lt;br /&gt;hj</li>
            <li>The first ingredient is always water, which is what you want, but Shea butter is NOT the second ingredient.</li>
            <li>That night my boyfriend touched my relaxed hair and said \\&quot;Wow!</li>
            <li>My newly natural curly hair LOVES this leave in conditioner!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s only being sold for under 7$ any higher than</li>
            <li>No matter how many other products I try, I always come back to this one.  </li>
            <li>My curls came out conditioned and soft!</li>
            <li>I first used this product as a deep conditioner along with some additional oils.</li>
            <li>amazon shopping and ease of buying as well as offers through Prime Membership!</li>
            <li>/&gt;the labeling provided to many retailers seems to be off; i&#x27;m not sure if Amazon is included.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve been fortunate to buy it from a few stores (both on the ground and online) for less than $5 per jar so as long as my hair responds positively to it or until I find something that works better, this product will stay on my winter &#x27;HG&#x27; list.ecure using this product -</li>

            <li>I only dry my hair halfway so that I can shape my hair the way I want it and let it dry on its own.</li>
            <li>Be aware that the picture and description are for the old formula, where shea butter is the 2nd ingredient.</li>
            <li>It makes it very easy to tame and manage my curls, it is a part of my daily hair routine</li>
            <li>Overall, I love this product, but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend buying it off of amazon because it&#x27;s about half the price if you buy it from Wal-Mart.</li>
            <li>For 3rd day hair I spray my hair all over, apply a good amount while soaking wet, brush with a bore brush when half dry and finger coil into fresh curls.</li>
            <li>she said to do lots of deep conditioning (with egg yolk, honey, some conditioners, pure virgin olive oil, tea tree oil etc..) and use Cantu products.</li>
            <li>I decided to try it because I had pretty decent results with Shea butter from my local African shop I bought for my skin.</li>
            <li>When I first wrote the review, I was a long term transitioner into natural hair.</li>
            <li>This has nothing to do with the product itself, but this is issue clearly needs to be addressed.</li>
            <li>I was playing with my moms natural hair and noticed it was incredibly soft.</li>
            <li>Your hair is soft...</li>
            <li>She is ecstatic about the way her natural hair looks and it has helped me to see her vision, as well.</li>
            <li>You absolutely can&#x27;t beat this low price!</li>
            <li>but it does not work for everyone&#x27;s natural hair...</li>
            <li>I am now fully natural, with about 7 inches of natural, 4b/c hair.</li>
            <li>When I wake up in the morning, my hair is soft, silky, moisturized, shiny.</li>
            <li>but when I went natural.</li>
            <li>Leaves your hair soft and managable.</li>
            <li>I never knew my hair could be so soft and wavy without blow drying.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s going to be that way, and that is the point of going natural.</li>
            <li>It does moisturizes my hair and makes it feel soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t provide a whole lot of shine but enough to notice a difference.</li>
            <li>This product dries my hair completely.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>I have a natural hair style</li>
            <li>It does contain hydrolyzed wheat protein (fyi for those that are protein sensitive), but that hasn&#x27;t been a problem for me.</li>
            <li>Hair felt softer and I was surprised to find that my hair had no oily feel.</li>
            <li>I have natural 3c/4a hair</li>
            <li>Hair feels soft but there is a bit of residue that stays in my hair that I cannot stand.</li>
            <li>Leaves hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>so my particular hair texture is very wavy, and slightly dry for this time of the year but not heavily course or damaging.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 16 weeks post relaxer (going natural).</li>
            <li>This product is recommended in natural hair posts but this is a no CAN DO for my 4c hair.</li>
            <li>,the formula was changed in early 2012.</li>
            <li>Hair is protein, it will naturally retain</li>
            <li>I am almost 3 months natural</li>
            <li>It makes our hair soft and manageable.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been natural for about a year now and wash days always made me miss my relaxed hair.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve had no trouble with build up since I wash my hair each week with either a shampoo bar or cleansing co-wash</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve had no trouble with build up since I wash my hair each week with either a shampoo bar or cleansing co-wash conditioner.    </li>
            <li>It can be on natural or permed (relaxed) hair.</li>
            <li>I have used this on natural hair styles, but using it alone (will not provide a lot of moisture to your ends).</li>
            <li>gos)&lt;br /&gt;It dries clear and when u unravel ur twists they are soooo soft and shiny.  </li>
            <li>Anyway, I was advised NOT to do ANY chemical treatments in my hair for at LEAST 3-4 MORE WEEKS AFTER MY TOUCH-UP WAS DO!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Whether you are a natural, transitioner or touch-up extender...</li>
            <li>I have 4c natural hair &amp; it makes my hair manageable.</li>
            <li>I have been trying to embrace my naturally curly hair for a couple of months now.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m wearing my hair naturally and this products conditions well.  </li>
            <li>This detangles and leaves hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>It makes it soft on the spot.</li>
            <li>Leave it in after a shower and sleep with your hair wrapped up in a towel and leave it in until your next shower(it&#x27;ll feel weird and crusty for the day but your hair will feel so soft when you wash it out), great for repairing bleached hair</li>
            <li>I was transitioning from permed hair to natural hair.  </li>
            <li>I recommend this product to  all natural out there.</li>
            <li>It was no longer soft or shiny.  </li>
            <li>I am a natural, with the 4b/4c type of hair</li>
            <li>I read blogs on natural hair care and tips</li>
            <li>so if you can try to find it locally near you.^^</li>
            <li>(she&#x27;s almost 2 years old).</li>
            <li>I use this product as a leave it treatment and my 4a natural hair</li>
            <li>I slept in it overnight, in the morning my hair was so soft, bouncy and shiny.</li>
            <li>my hair has grown to bra band length using it with extra virgin olive oil, spring water and gentle detangling.  </li>
            <li>I started using this product when I was transitioning from relaxed to natural hair about six years ago.</li>
            <li>I have been natural for almost two years</li>
            <li>can i help them with going natural.  </li>

            <li>My hair feels so soft and manageable now.</li>
            <li>it defines your curls and hair is soft all day plus you get two jars</li>
            <li>This did nothing for my natural hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a product junky as far as trying to find the &amp;#34;perfect&amp;#34; conditioner, so I tried this.  </li>
            <li>my hair feels really soft when i put it in</li>
            <li>I have natural hair and need a lot of moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>Keeps hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>Absorbs well, smells faint but good, and</li>
            <li>I do not have thick type hair but more of a medium-soft grade texture, and not a lot of frizz but do tend to have a lot of problems with hair detangle.</li>
            <li>Never been able to detangle here hair nor than 2 inches thick at a time.</li>
            <li>Her hair is very fine, with tight coils and curls and tends to get very dry.</li>
            <li>Let me just start out by saying,  i&#x27;ve tried soooo many products for my hair and none of them seemed to soften my ends or make my hair less dry.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It also claims to help with Frizz Free Hair by applying it daily to split ends or damaged areas; \\&quot;simply comb through hair, and then allow for it to dry naturally on its own.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>given that I don&#x27;t use this product as a daily moisturizer and they appear towards the end of the list, I felt reasonably secure using this product - thus far the proteins have never caused my hair to &#x27;freak out&#x27; as it has in the past when I used products with a high level of protein</li>
            <li>used Cantu LICRC on dry, co-washed, AND freshly washed hair with the same results.</li>
            <li>Being a person of Asian descent, my hair was no long shiny straight.  </li>
            <li>Also, if you mix plain yogurt, honey, olive oil, and real aloe vera gel (the real one) together, and then place in your hair as a treatment, cover and sit for 30 minutes, then wash out, your hair will be SOFT and your curls will start clumping together (a sign of moisture</li>

            <li>As always my cream came in on time and works wonderfully on my natural hair and my stuff is thick and very diffecult to manage I put large amout in and leave on overnight rinse out next day am ready for the world.</li>
            <li>The new formula has Canola Oil as the second ingredient and Shea Butter is now the sixth or seventh ingredient.  </li>
            <li>I am still fairly new at taking care of my hair and I am currently about 8 months in transition.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Apply any stand-alone regular hair conditioner with Dr Miracle&#x27;s Healing Live in Treatment and Conditioner; sit with a heating cap for about 15-20 minutes and then rinse.</li>
            <li>I received two containers of the NEW formula where shea butter is 7th and canola oil is 2nd.</li>
            <li>I decided to go natural last year because I saw a friend&#x27;s natural hair</li>
            <li>now that I have FINALLY FOUND products that work for me(*whew*), I will religiously follow my daily hair regimen</li>

            <li>I am not one of those girls who can wash&#x27; fro&#x27; and go nor do my two strand twist/ blow out last more than a few hours, yes, even in the dry NYC fall/winter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I have 3b/3c, fine strands, thick density, normal-high porosity hair.</li>
            <li>I have natural hair and this is the only product I use as my leave in.</li>
            <li>This is the only leave in that makes my hair soft, manageable and silky.  </li>
            <li>also sometimes if u use too much your hair will feel harder to comb tru</li>
            <li>The old formula has Shea Butter as the second ingredient.  </li>
            <li>The jars apparently had been opened before purchasing.  </li>
            <li>natural back in 2012.</li>
            <li>I wear my hair natural so moisture is key.</li>
            <li>I use it as a leave-in treatment after I deep condition and it leaves my hair feeling soft in the morning</li>
            <li>I really liked Miss Jessie&#x27;s curly pudding, but seriously, it is ridiculously expensive.</li>
            <li>Hair doesn&#x27;t seem to look any better or worse to me, but did feel softer.</li>
            <li>Overall if you have really thick dry hair and you want a little manageability this would be a great product for you.</li>
            <li>it was so hard and dry), so I am glad i have this now to use until i wash it out.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still new to taking care of my hair and if I find a shampoo and deep conditioner regimen that makes my hair &amp;#34;pop&amp;#34; then I believe this product has the potential to be one of my favs.  </li>
            <li>and my ends dont dry out as much as they used to I recommend this product to freinds and anyone that asks daily.</li>
            <li>on dry hair, too much WILL leave the white residue.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m black and have worn my hair natural my whole life.</li>
            <li>first time I used it I tried it with additional leave-in treatments/styling aids and the result were less than favorable.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m mixed (with black &amp; white) &amp; have super curly hair.</li>
            <li>so far i have been using this product for a week and although my hair is not natural it still makes my hair incredibly soft especially after straightening it.</li>
            <li>When I take down my twist out, I am always left with soft bouncy curls that are very defined.</li>
            <li>The one I purchased from a store does not have shea butter as the second ingredient, however I applied it last night and it did keep my hair soft and moisturized and</li>
            <li>I happened to purchase the last of the old batch from my local BSS.</li>
            <li>I am currently transitioning back to natural from being relaxed for years.</li>
            <li>you can never go wrong with shea butter and ever since i went natural this has helped keep my hair moist, healthy and has helped it grow too</li>
            <li>i s not dry at that length!&lt;br /&gt;Does</li>
            <li>My hair is a mix of 4A/B/C-- that means dry, course, brillo-like super tight coils.</li>
            <li>I notice that the permed hair from the top right side of my head broke off really bad.  </li>
            <li>I usually use about a quarter size finger full on each section of freshly washed damp hair (after it has dried a bit under a t-shirt)and add either grapeseed or olive oil to seal it; braid/twist it over night to dry.  </li>
            <li>This product keeps my hair soft all week long.</li>
            <li>Lasts long, natural cream without residue.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the difference between losing 75 percent in length to the heat versus looking like I have natural long curls which I do with Cantu.</li>
            <li>A week later I put a small amount of the Shea Butter in my hair again to help maintain moisture and it feels just as soft and silky as it did the first day again.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s a little bit higher here than in your local beauty store</li>
            <li>It is worth the money as a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li>I tried this product 3 other times and it left it looking the same no matter how much of the product</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this three times, each time on dry, natural hair.</li>
            <li>My hair is so much softer, produces looser curls and makes it less frizzy, I have biracial hair</li>
            <li>My hair is naturally curly and dry.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s super thick</li>
            <li>This product in my opinion failed to live up to its expectations that it would nourish, smooth and softens while protecting against damage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have long, thick wavy/curly hair that has become a lot drier over this last year or so, thanks to getting older, no doubt!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m half black and half Japanese, so my hair is very thick and is mostly s-shaped curls, some spirals underneath but with a hint of kinky as it easily</li>
            <li>thus far the proteins have never caused my hair to &#x27;freak out&#x27; as it has in the past when I used products with a high level of protein</li>
            <li>This leave in conditioning repair cream worked wonders for me, I am a 3c/4a mix with very dry locks, but this stuff in combination with an olive oil treatment cream made my hair look very shiny, soft, and professional looking to the point where I&#x27;m getting compliments all day long every day that I use it (which is everyday now!).</li>

            <li> This made my curls look beautiful</li>
            <li> Imagine my dismay when bath time (11AM) featuring beautiful curls, morphed into a brillo pad upon waking from his nap (3PM).</li>

            <li> It comes out beautiful.  </li>

            <li> and my frizz was in great control</li>
            <li> I like the results it gives for my braid outs, but I don&#x27;t think it is a great moisturizing conditioner.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s great for moisture</li>
            <li> Great for transitioners like me.</li>
            <li> Yes this product is great for 4a/4b hair...which is mine, but this price is a no no...go to Walmart or target to get your deals....</li>
            <li> This stuff is great..</li>
            <li> I have another shea butter leave in conditioner that I use that works great and makes my hair curly without scrunching up or cause frizz.</li>
            <li> It smells great.</li>
            <li> It gives me great definition and keeps my hair moisturized, but doesn&#x27;t provide hold like a gel would.</li>

            <li> After two weeks I gave up on Cantu for good.</li>
            <li> After washing my hair I take a good scoop out, and massage it in my hair.</li>
            <li> It is really good to condition your hair.</li>
            <li> bring a comb with you will be a good decision</li>

            <li> After reading all the good reviews I thought I would love it.</li>
            <li> Honestly, this product just sits on my hair.</li>

            <li> and it has a nice smell.</li>
            <li> It has a nice dewy scent and doesn&#x27;t have that heavy-perfume aroma; the smell is resemblance of the tropics with a hint of coconut.</li>
            <li> Your hair will feel Super-soft; having that truly conditioned feeling/healthy look and leave hair with a nice minty scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love this product, it smells so good and leaves my hair nice and</li>

            <li> Am relaxed and I use it to moisturize nightly and seal with Rose oil and wrap my hair with a silk scarf and let me tell you all I do in the a.m. is unwrap and style.</li>
            <li> Absolutely the best...</li>
            <li> ...it leaves some kind of residue if you try to mix with another product.</li>
            <li> It is very moisturizing and smells great!</li>

            <li> have used many products on my hair from the cheaper Africa&#x27;s Best, to Carol&#x27;s Daughter, to Mixed Chicks and also Miss Jessie&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I leave it in over night under a hair cap once every week, and I have noticed that I don&#x27;t have as many split ends</li>
            <li> I love this product for my daughters&#x27; 3c and 4b hair.</li>
            <li> I find that my hair is much more manageable and styles hold better when I use this product.  </li>
            <li> and I absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li> Simply the best.</li>
            <li> Better off with something else.</li>
            <li> I get so many compliments when I use it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a year now, and I&#x27;ve finally figured out the best way to use it (for me anyway).  </li>
            <li> It came a day earlier than predicted which is awesome!</li>
            <li> I love to use this leave in conditioner..</li>
            <li> So I was on the hunt for something better.</li>
            <li> It just felt like I putting product that just sat on top of my hair.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve got to say this cream is awesome for any dude (or chick) with a hair type similar to mine who doesn&#x27;t like spending more than 10 min in the bathroom styling their mane.</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> and I love how creamy it is.</li>
            <li> I had to keep re-apply more product just to have that softness I was hoping to achieve.</li>
            <li> Works best when your constantly doing wash and go&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> No awful smells either</li>
            <li> help keep your hair healthy</li>
            <li> I love this product, however when I received it yesterday, the lid had come off of one of the jars, and both jars were covered with product.  </li>
            <li> Thankfully it was encased in a plastic bag, and I was able to collect most of the product.  </li>
            <li> : Okay, I just have to add this...</li>
            <li> I bought this as my Christmas gift from my guy, and he even said that my hair looks a lot better.</li>
            <li> I am in love with the smell.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m currently googling best leave in conditioners AGAIN....</li>
            <li> Keep looking around for something better.</li>
            <li> It seems to be okay.  </li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I love this Shea butter</li>
            <li> I love this leave in conditioner.  </li>
            <li> If I co wash and use this amazing stuff I can get even the ends of my highlighted hair to stay glossy and smooth for 2 days - even though I don&#x27;t use and heat at all.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> I love the way this product smells.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I purchased this product</li>
            <li> the best!!!&lt;br /&gt;I love the texture.</li>
            <li> Works OK.</li>
            <li> After reading the many reviews I thought I would give it a shot</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> It soothes the dryness, detangles and helps some with the frizz - not a miracle for that, but better than it&#x27;s been.  </li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> Have recommended it to many friends.</li>
            <li> Love everything about it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> okay.  </li>
            <li> I love to scoop and slather</li>
            <li> but still it won&#x27;t come out, I have to squeeze hard.&lt;br /&gt;Cantu, one more star for its ease of use.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t stop touching</li>
            <li> but I still could not get anything meaningful..</li>
            <li> the shampoo worked magic for my hair..</li>
            <li> and I was able to comb as if I had conditioned it.</li>
            <li> I love my cantu products..</li>
            <li> I love my cantu products..</li>
            <li> so you get the most out of it.</li>
            <li> I love it, love it</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> Even with the ingredient change (I remember shea butter being #2 on the list), I still love this conditioner most.</li>
            <li> Purchased many times over.</li>
            <li> Hair feels very well conditioned and great shine to it.</li>
            <li> (focus mostly on the ends)</li>
            <li> I do have to heat it up by sitting under a hooded dryer as I have low porosity hair, but it works wonderfully and my hair feels nourished</li>
            <li> LOVE  </li>
            <li> and I already recommended it to my mom :)</li>
            <li> I am satisfied and will continue to purchase.</li>
            <li> LOVE IT</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> I love using the Cantu Leave In Conditioner.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had much better results with Elasta QP Olive oil &amp; Mango</li>
            <li> My hair loves it and therefore I love it.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> Perhaps if my hair type were more curly, it would work.  </li>
            <li> excellent product, leaves hair so soft and rich.</li>
            <li> overall i ,love this product and will keep using it!!!</li>
            <li> This was one of the first actually good conditioners I tried.  </li>
            <li> The smell is awesome, it lasts all day long.</li>
            <li> It came out soft and shiny and beautiful.</li>
            <li> Loved it, has a great scent that lasts but is not too strong, and the product lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> but i&#x27;m excited!</li>
            <li> I love this product and strongly recommend it.</li>
            <li> The only good thing I have to say about this product is that it smells good.</li>
            <li> Overall though, its a good product for sealing in &amp; moisturizing the hair no matter how u use it, &amp; a good product for the price(not this price, though).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The Cantu leave in conditioner is great for moisture and it leaves my hair very soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> Sensational for very curly hair!</li>
            <li> great product still use to this day and im going natural so its a great product for those ladies who are thinking of going natural or are already doing so.</li>
            <li> This is a great conditioner- makes my hair so soft.</li>
            <li> OMG i am so glad that i did because it is fantastic.</li>
            <li> My hair looks very healthy and bouncy even after using hot appliances.</li>
            <li> its a great leave in for natural hair</li>
            <li> I leaves my hair soft and manageable and it smells great.</li>
            <li> It smells great and it keeps my kinky coils hydrated and soft.</li>
            <li> Bought this product from my local pharmacy for my incredibly damaged 4a/4b hair.</li>
            <li> Ive got 4c texturised hair, I love this product, very moisturizing and nourishing, leaves hair soft, best leave in</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s mineral oil free (excellent), it leaves dry hair moisturized and manageable.  </li>
            <li> After endless trial and error I came across this wonderful, god-sent leave in conditioner.</li>
            <li> I instantly liked it because I felt like I finally was getting somewhere with good products.  </li>
            <li> the smell is also strong.</li>
            <li> If you are bothered by strong scents then you might want to overlook this product.</li>
            <li> the cantu shea butter grow strong treatment.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not at all sticky when it dries, so many of the &amp;#34;leave in&amp;#34; products feel stiff or oily, but the Cantu Shea Butter is awesome.</li>
            <li> Its soo good to find products that good soo early on my journey which makes going natural easy!</li>
            <li> This is my first purchase of any Cantu products and this one is AMAZING.</li>
            <li> Anyone who wants a good conditioner thats not greasy and smells great, Look no further you have found it.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave any residue, not stiff and the smell is pleasant.</li>
            <li> but I didn&#x27;t pay attention to the fine print</li>
            <li> i do get the best results when hair is slightly damp.</li>
            <li> always had hair that once relaxed, it was fine</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have any build up from this product, BUT my hair is incredibly damaged and dry</li>
            <li> Doing this adds volume so I have a fuller, more rounded shape, and it dries the curls quickly.</li>
            <li> Doing this adds volume so I have a fuller, more rounded shape, and it dries the curls quickly.</li>
            <li> This is a really good product for bringing out the natural curl pattern in your hair!  </li>
            <li> They put it in after washing their hair and then on days when they don&#x27;t wash their hair, they just comb a little through and it works great!</li>
            <li> I have used many popular products and none kept my hair soft and moisturized pass a couple of days.</li>
            <li> This fit the job.</li>
            <li> Its also great for gel styling to add extra moisture.</li>
            <li> This stuff is light weight but does the job.</li>
            <li> It is also fantastic for bleached hair as I am experimenting with blond color now</li>
            <li> the texture is smooth and creamy like lotion.</li>
            <li> It is great for after shampoo usage, color treated hair or after relaxed hair; it does not matter the outcome it has the same level of consistency each and every time.</li>
            <li> I just want something to put in it to smooth it out some and moisturize it, which I think I&#x27;ve found in this.</li>
            <li> Overall a great leave in for natural/transitioning hair.</li>
            <li> if you want silky shiny light stuff, this is not it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Hair is softer, shines and almost frizz free.</li>
            <li> Once my hair dries it is soft and manageable and smells really good.</li>
            <li> Nice leave in for natural hair not my favorite, but does the job of moisturizing my 3c hair.</li>
            <li> For the longest time  i have been looking for a product that smells good and keeps my natural hair moist, and Cantu does the job.</li>
            <li> I have curly hair and find that with Cantu leave in conditioner my hair stays soft, moisturized, and smelling really good.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I will say out of the various Cantu products I smelled in the store this company is consistent with having a nice, pleasant scent with their products.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s best to put the Cantu Shea Butter on first and let your hair dry up to 80% then apply curling or twisting product.</li>
            <li> I love to use this after washing my hair and right before a twist out.</li>
            <li> It is best used on wet or damp hair and with perhaps a little castor oil or oil of your choice to kind of blend it in more and make sure</li>
            <li> And when we first start this natural hair journey, we run out and buy all of them (getting caught up in the hype, lol).</li>
            <li> great for natural hair and is much cheaper online than in stores!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a product junkie and am constantly trying new products to find the best ones.</li>
            <li> just wanted to add to my original review.</li>
            <li> But I stick by my original review of this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a year or more and the results have been consistent.</li>
            <li> my hair is pretty healthy.</li>
            <li> I fell in love with it since the first time I tried it.</li>
            <li> One contains a higher concentration and many websites have that image and ingredient list even though they are shipping the one with a lower concentration of shea</li>
            <li> it is the best for hair like mine (very fine, very soft, porous, tightly coiled hair).</li>
            <li> This stuff is GREAT, so nourishing, if your hair is dry you need this.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair soft and shiny and more healthy.</li>
            <li> I recently transitioned from relaxed to natural hair, and this shea butter produces the best twist-outs!</li>
            <li> I recently started caring for my hair and this moisturizer is good stuff.</li>
            <li> There are so many products on the market, promising all types of results.</li>
            <li> I get nice soft curls when I twist with it--more like curls instead of waves.</li>
            <li> (I later discovered the miracle of good heat protectors).</li>
            <li> I use it all the time, I love it so much</li>
            <li> I had heard so much about Cantu products and I&#x27;m so glad I gave it a try.</li>
            <li> Smells good but leaves a white residue on the hair when it dries.  </li>
            <li> I am currently loving Cantu natural hair products.</li>
            <li> It smells good enough to eat.</li>
            <li> This was such a good deal</li>
            <li> Fresh smelling, light souffle texture.  </li>
            <li> After covering it with a plastic bag for a good ten minutes</li>
            <li> my hair is full and gets frizzy when the weather is damp and shit.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Nothing has treated my hair better, absolutely nothing.</li>
            <li> LOVE this product so much.</li>
            <li> Odie el olor, me produce nauseas, no lo tolere aunque al cabello le cae super bien.</li>
            <li> However, if you&#x27;re looking for a great leave-in you can absolutely use alone (or in deep conditioners, or as a detangler, a wash-out conditioner, &amp; more)that leaves no waxiness or residue</li>
            <li> He has a Beautiful long tail (which doesn&#x27;t come about very often)</li>
            <li> I live by the stuff!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a new curly girl and still not sure exactly which products work best in my hair, but I decided to try this product because so many people swear by it.  </li>
            <li> I find that this mix of Cantu products is the best I&#x27;ve found so far, for so much cheaper than the ones I&#x27;ve mentioned above.</li>
            <li> I find that this mix of Cantu products is the best I&#x27;ve found so far, for so much cheaper than the ones I&#x27;ve mentioned above.</li>
            <li> It works in the hot Georgia Summer heat to keep my hair moisturized and frizz free.</li>
            <li> Helps to reduce breakage on hair ends.&lt;br /&gt;Cons-causes build up and flakes when used with other products.&lt;br /&gt;Nevertheless its an excellent conditioner for natural hair.</li>
            <li> Really easy to scoop the thing out in large amount.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> product is great holds the hair down</li>
            <li> This product is great in black hair.</li>
            <li> Would 100% recommend for curly, dry, chemically damaged, ethnic hair as part of a good hair care routine.</li>
            <li> First, let me begin by saying, O.MGOSH!</li>
            <li> and I know in a month or two I am gonna be even more head over heels with my natural hair!</li>
            <li> and I know in a month or two I am gonna be even more head over heels with my natural hair!</li>
            <li> Hello everyone, I am a transitioning african-american mixed, I love this product!</li>
            <li> and that&#x27;s exactly where it went!  </li>
            <li> I was excited to use this because of all the great reviews, I am turning into a product junky, trying to find the best product for my hair - low porousity, coarse, thick</li>
            <li> The more cream I use, the more defined the curls are when they dry, but they also aren&#x27;t crispy at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product will give most naturals super soft, touchable hair.</li>
            <li> It dries light on your hair, but is very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> Since it is sulfate free, it doesn&#x27;t lather up much.</li>
            <li> than those few cons its a great product</li>
            <li> It has been since Nov 2013 since I had a touch-up and the outgrowth is smooth, hydrated, frizz-free, the relaxed hair is unscathed from the intense moisture punch</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s definitely worth trying.</li>
            <li> But, cantu is worth a try if you are battling dryness.</li>
            <li> cantu is one of my favorite lines for natural hair</li>
            <li> Ok im a natural girl.</li>
            <li> It came fast and as expected the product was Great....</li>
            <li> love it makes here soft</li>
            <li> I love this product on my natural hair.</li>
            <li> fresh</li>
            <li> far better job than conditioner or oil.  </li>
            <li> Well eventually I started to do my own hair and experiment with different products and techniques.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite leave in conditioners, using it leaves my hair soft and silky.</li>
            <li> It has a very pleasant light scent that lingers but doesn&#x27;t bother me as I am not too sensitive to fragrances; it has a creamy somewhat thick consistency that melts into my hair as I apply</li>
            <li> Got this yesterday and used it right away.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been struggling with trying to get the right products for my hair</li>
            <li> and now I feel like I&#x27;m headed in the right direction .</li>
            <li> But once i put this in my hair, I seal it with organic extra virgin coconut oil, &amp; hair is strong and soft &amp; smells nice.</li>
            <li> It is a heavier product so Co-washing is a good way to keep down on flakes or build-up.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair soft and easy to comb through.</li>
            <li> This keeps my hair soft and easy to comb.</li>
            <li> The grow strong and leave in repair creams made my hair really soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> its now soft, has no knots, easy to comb or twist, looks and feels well moisturized</li>
            <li> its now soft, has no knots, easy to comb or twist, looks and feels well moisturized</li>
            <li> My hair grew a lot more and was way more manageable then before, I have very curly hair, if i did my hair in the morning I would have tangles and knots by the afternoon, I recommend this product to everyone that want&#x27;s to keep there curls in check and the great thing is it cuts down time when I air dry, make sure you apply this product everywhere and make little curls with your finger.</li>
            <li> so it does not look frizzy nice texture not stiff easy to use thru the day after using in AM wet and reshape on the go&lt;</li>
            <li> /&gt;I am very very satisfied.&lt;br</li>
            <li> texture is very much like body</li>
            <li> First time ever using shea butter and conditioner definitely works treats and helps my hair very very well glad</li>
            <li> I will definitely get more.</li>
            <li> Obviously some products will work better for some than for others.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> They are pretty defined.</li>
            <li> They are pretty defined.</li>
            <li> and I also don&#x27;t shed as much!</li>
            <li> I have tried many different products on my bi-racial kids hair but nothing seemed to keep the moisture in their hair.  </li>
            <li> This will likely stay in my product list until I find better.</li>
            <li> I have this set up to ship every 3 months or so and its more than enough.</li>
            <li> I use this product for my braidouts and twistouts with fabulously consistent results.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, I bought it after I did my big chop 5 months ago.  </li>
            <li> and I cannot express enough how much I love this product.</li>
            <li> I recommend following up with this product after you use the Motions Moisture Plus; the two are safe to use together or by itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> then I had when I first used the product.</li>
            <li> Made hair soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> The first time I used this product, it didn&#x27;t saturate my hair like I need too.</li>
            <li> Honestly, I&#x27;ve never tried a great conditioning cream like Cantu&#x27;s..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read many reviews that said they were left with flakes and residue.  </li>
            <li> First, let me explain the product.</li>
            <li> And at first, you might want to just slather it on, and just let your hair absorb it.</li>
            <li> hair butter (once or twice I&#x27;ve used ECO styling gel on top of the butter/milk/styler) and have never had problems with flakes or had white balls of product</li>
            <li> Even Garnier&#x27;s LIC, surprisingly, left my hair more malleable and moisturized than Cantu&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I am a product junkie who can&#x27;t resist trying the latest deep conditioners, oils, and shampoos for my curly hair.</li>
            <li> , I tried it on my daughters hair and its great for them, so at least I dont have to throw it out</li>
            <li> This was the first leave in that I started using for my transition.</li>
            <li> I recently tried this product and I love it.</li>
            <li> I tried olive oil products and many different greasy ethnic hair products.</li>
            <li> If you stick with this leave in conditioner you will most definitely reap the benefits.</li>
            <li> I was fooled for the first two weeks.  </li>
            <li> I have used this product several times since purchasing it and am pleased.</li>
            <li> It is exactly as described.</li>
            <li> Defining Creme Glaze which also did a pretty fantastic job adding moisture and afterwards my hair was shiny and soft.</li>
            <li> Great for thick and curly hair.</li>
            <li> It tames all the frizzes and leaves your hair soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> After just the first application I noticed a difference.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s okay, no big deal.  </li>
            <li> In the few days I&#x27;ve had it, it&#x27;s been really good.</li>
            <li> I now use this product mostly as an ingredient in my own deep conditioner concoction (which includes other conditioners, coconut &amp; olive oil, honey, etc.)</li>
            <li> I did my big chop and was very excited..</li>
            <li> the ones that say \\&quot;shea soft\\&quot; instead of \\&quot;shea butter\\&quot; up top seem to have the same ingredients as the containers which omit \\&quot;made with pure shea butter.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> My first and favorite natural hair product by far.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very affordable and I love that I can buy it from my local drugstore/ beauty supply store.</li>
            <li> I bought this conditioner on the reccommendation of three websites--which reccommended a good moisturizer for African American course hair (like mine).  </li>
            <li> This leave in conditioner is just a MIRACLE it leaves your hair super soft and shiny !</li>
            <li> Repeat at least (2x&#x27;s a week); your hair will feel absolutely amazing!</li>
            <li> I keeps my hair long and healthy without feeling oily.</li>
            <li> It smells good, but I&#x27;m not really sure if it&#x27;s helping to do what it says it will do.</li>
            <li> It is very moisturizing and provides good slip, especially natural African American hair.  </li>
            <li> I bought this product and the very first use i literally could feel my hair becoming soft instantly as i massaged it into my hair.</li>
            <li> Go on, be generous with use, it will soak it right up with no thick greasy residue.</li>
            <li> The top dries flatter and the ends curl up and get thicker as they dry.  </li>
            <li> It leaves my hair feeling so super soft and my curls are as curly and defined as having Shirley Temple hair.</li>
            <li> but it just make my hair more dry.  </li>
            <li> It has a strong menthol scent and you can actually feel it tingling throughout your hair but isn&#x27;t overbearing on the scalp.</li>
            <li> The smell is pleasant and the consistency isn&#x27;t too thick</li>
            <li> Some containers of the \\&quot;Leave in Conditioner\\&quot; omit \\&quot;made with pure shea\\&quot; butter and those have shea butter as the #2 ingredient.</li>
            <li> the containers that have \\&quot;made with pure  </li>
            <li> And my hair is more fluffy than super defined.</li>
            <li> I used this product once and was pleasantly surprised as how soft his tail felt and how easily the tangles combed out.&lt;br /&gt;His</li>
            <li> bought Cantu Shea Butter (leave-in conditioning repair cream) after hearing these two females raving how much they love this product while shopping in the hair aisle at my local beauty supply store; as I have never tried Cantu products before I am always eager to try/learn new things.</li>
            <li> It smells really nice.. and keep my daughter hair moisturize and even enhance her curls a little ..</li>
            <li> Mellows it right out in a natural curl way!</li>
            <li> First time I put it on my hair, it left my edges really smooth and soft and most importantly, flat.</li>
            <li> The jar is huge and will last me for months and maybe even years!</li>
            <li> really soft\\</li>
            <li> For the life of me I do not know why people like this product so much.</li>
            <li> And don&#x27;t forget to try the LOC method, if dryness is really a problem for you.</li>
            <li> retention).is really a problem for you.</li>
            <li> I would really recommend my fav</li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;ve had that epiphany, I&#x27;ve been so much happer with my hair.</li>
            <li> I bend forward and gently scrunch my hair into the diffuser and hold the dryer still.</li>
            <li> I bend forward and gently scrunch my hair into the diffuser and hold the dryer still.</li>
            <li> It really moisturizes my hair well.</li>
            <li> My hair&#x27;s much softer than before.</li>
            <li> After one use my hair felt silky and had so much shine.</li>
            <li> This product however doesnt make my hair curl no matter how much i scrunch, it made my hair very stringy and puffy.</li>
            <li> highly highly recommend it for curly haired girls who need to condition and defrizz!</li>
            <li> so you&#x27;ll have to watch how much you use.</li>
            <li> There is too much wATER</li>
            <li> This leave-in conditioner really leaves my hair moisturized.</li>
            <li> I just don&#x27;t think it does much to help it either.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s cheap enough for you to give it a try.</li>
            <li> It has a light weight (about the consistency of regular hair conditioner), and doesn&#x27;t leave a waxy or oily residue in your hair.</li>
            <li> Fast service...*thumbs up</li>
            <li> I really like this.</li>
            <li> My hair absolutely loves this product.</li>
            <li> I even used this when I was transitioning and it made the 2 textures very manageable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It moisturized my hair very well.</li>
            <li> leaves my hair very moist.</li>
            <li> /&gt;the price is reasonable and the amount (16oz/2pk) is generous</li>
            <li> conditioners don&#x27;t really do anything for you anyway.</li>
            <li> I can really see the length of my hair now</li>
            <li> Thanks Cantu...</li>
            <li> I can really see the length of my hair now</li>
            <li> Thanks Cantu...</li>
            <li> start breaking off, this stuff helps a whole lot.</li>
            <li> It literally changed my whole hair routine.</li>
            <li> And after 3 years of curly girl techniques and cantu, my hair has really grown.</li>
            <li> would give the company a 5 for how fast it was shipped, but the package arrive with some of the product leaking out of the container.</li>
            <li> Now that I am further along in trying out products and my hair has more natural length...</li>
            <li> i use it daily in my natural hair for more moisture and it works.</li>
            <li> Works wonders in my seven year old daughters curly hair!!!</li>
            <li> The only thing good about cantu shea products are the prices, other than that they suck.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Now before going further into details I think it is important that you know my particular texture of hair.</li>
            <li> Definitely think its worth purchasing!</li>
            <li> I was excited to try it and couldn&#x27;t wait for my next wash/conditioning session at home in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was excited about the price, but personally I learned the &amp;#34;you get what you pay for&amp;#34</li>
            <li> I have tried other mostly organic products</li>
            <li> This product is amazing, I use it everyday and after a 2 weeks I notices my hair was a lot more moisturized and also had less split ends</li>
            <li> I only use it on clean, damp hair.</li>
            <li> use this as a rinse out conditioner as well as a leave-in treatment; Motions Moisture Plus product provides consistent results and is worth every cent; and for only a fraction of what one wouldpay for using Miss Jessie&#x27;s products.</li>
            <li> Even though my hair is pretty good, if it gets long, hitting mid back, it gets dry.&lt;br /&gt;Been</li>
            <li> Otherwise your hair will be full of white residue.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be sure to check back and adjust this review as deemed fit in a few months though.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so pleased with it, it really is better than anything else I&#x27;ve ever tried &amp; I&#x27;ve wasted so much money on just about every other product on the market.</li>
            <li> is laying down more</li>
            <li> The new formula didn&#x27;t work for me!</li>
            <li> Sometimes less is more.</li>
            <li> I suppose if you are one of those people who want super definition, and only want to twist once, and then pineapple for the rest of the week without having to re-twist, then Cantu won&#x27;t do that for you--because it has no hold.</li>
            <li> , I get a decent hold</li>
            <li> It fell short to leave my hair feeling, \\&quot;smooth or soft and/or manageable\\&quot; as its claim.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product is like enough to provide adequate moisture.</li>
            <li> Main ingredient used to be shea butter.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried SO many products for help, wasted a lot of money, but this is really working.  </li>
            <li> I will try the custard again when she&#x27;s much older.</li>
            <li> Mainly because my mom used to do it.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;it was very light and not thick like the other Cantu Shea Butter for natural hair leave in conditioning i got from a store.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Another product I highly recommend&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I highly reccommend</li>
            <li> highly recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> It weighs my hair down a little, but I welcome it since I deal with shrinkage.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair really soft and very curly.  </li>
            <li> is moist and SOFT, plus much easier to manage.</li>
            <li> Keeps my hair soft &amp; straight.</li>
            <li> I love that it is not too heavy but can be used in abundance to help set my curls.</li>
            <li> I add some argan oil after the product has air dried and this eliminates most of the flakes even though it&#x27;s annoying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It cost only $4.49 and can be found at major hair supply stores; it is for at home care and has a great light feeling to the hair and scent without hidden dyes or harsh</li>
            <li> It does a good job at keeping my dry poofy hair under control, but I find that it leaves my hair a bit dried out.</li>
            <li> Other wise a white residue will be left on hair.</li>
            <li> , i wait longer then normal for perms , and i experience so much new growth</li>
            <li> Normally I do two strain twist adding leave-in condition, leave my hair very soft.</li>
            <li> What I received was the new formula in the new bottle.  </li>
            <li> New formula also has Mineral Oil in it.</li>
            <li> Miracle&#x27;s Healing Live in Treatment and Conditioner - This product doesn&#x27;t just condition ones hair</li>
            <li> The new formula does not work as well for my hair.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m AA with a 1.5yr of new growth.</li>
            <li> I applied to newly shampooed hair and did bantu knots.</li>
            <li> Though, Oil is good for settling down my hair and probably prevents further damage but didn&#x27;t really moisturize or improve dry</li>
            <li> no white residue - which later looks like huge dandruff flakes - remain on you hair.</li>
            <li> Instead my hair felt dry and limb; nor did the product absorb quickly.</li>
            <li> Adds more sture but leaves white film if hair is too wet</li>
            <li> After blow drying, my hair has a very soft texture and no split ends or fly-aways are visible.</li>
            <li> I bought his product because it came highly recommended from the woman in my natural hair</li>
            <li> my hair is very soft and somewhat shiny&lt;br /&gt;hj</li>
            <li> The first ingredient is always water, which is what you want, but Shea butter is NOT the second ingredient.</li>
            <li> That night my boyfriend touched my relaxed hair and said \\&quot;Wow!</li>
            <li> My newly natural curly hair LOVES this leave in conditioner!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s only being sold for under 7$ any higher than</li>
            <li> No matter how many other products I try, I always come back to this one.  </li>
            <li> My curls came out conditioned and soft!</li>
            <li> I first used this product as a deep conditioner along with some additional oils.</li>
            <li> amazon shopping and ease of buying as well as offers through Prime Membership!</li>
            <li> /&gt;the labeling provided to many retailers seems to be off; i&#x27;m not sure if Amazon is included.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve been fortunate to buy it from a few stores (both on the ground and online) for less than $5 per jar so as long as my hair responds positively to it or until I find something that works better, this product will stay on my winter &#x27;HG&#x27; list.ecure using this product -</li>

            <li> I only dry my hair halfway so that I can shape my hair the way I want it and let it dry on its own.</li>
            <li> I only dry my hair halfway so that I can shape my hair the way I want it and let it dry on its own.</li>
            <li> Be aware that the picture and description are for the old formula, where shea butter is the 2nd ingredient.</li>
            <li> It makes it very easy to tame and manage my curls, it is a part of my daily hair routine</li>
            <li> Overall, I love this product, but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend buying it off of amazon because it&#x27;s about half the price if you buy it from Wal-Mart.</li>
            <li> For 3rd day hair I spray my hair all over, apply a good amount while soaking wet, brush with a bore brush when half dry and finger coil into fresh curls.</li>
            <li> she said to do lots of deep conditioning (with egg yolk, honey, some conditioners, pure virgin olive oil, tea tree oil etc..) and use Cantu products.</li>
            <li> I decided to try it because I had pretty decent results with Shea butter from my local African shop I bought for my skin.</li>
            <li> When I first wrote the review, I was a long term transitioner into natural hair.</li>
            <li> This has nothing to do with the product itself, but this is issue clearly needs to be addressed.</li>
            <li> I was playing with my moms natural hair and noticed it was incredibly soft.</li>
            <li> Your hair is soft...</li>
            <li> She is ecstatic about the way her natural hair looks and it has helped me to see her vision, as well.</li>
            <li> You absolutely can&#x27;t beat this low price!</li>
            <li> but it does not work for everyone&#x27;s natural hair...</li>
            <li> I am now fully natural, with about 7 inches of natural, 4b/c hair.</li>
            <li> When I wake up in the morning, my hair is soft, silky, moisturized, shiny.</li>
            <li> but when I went natural.</li>
            <li> Leaves your hair soft and managable.</li>
            <li> I never knew my hair could be so soft and wavy without blow drying.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s going to be that way, and that is the point of going natural.</li>
            <li> It does moisturizes my hair and makes it feel soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t provide a whole lot of shine but enough to notice a difference.</li>
            <li> This product dries my hair completely.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> I have a natural hair style</li>
            <li> It does contain hydrolyzed wheat protein (fyi for those that are protein sensitive), but that hasn&#x27;t been a problem for me.</li>
            <li> Hair felt softer and I was surprised to find that my hair had no oily feel.</li>
            <li> I have natural 3c/4a hair</li>
            <li> Hair feels soft but there is a bit of residue that stays in my hair that I cannot stand.</li>
            <li> Leaves hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> so my particular hair texture is very wavy, and slightly dry for this time of the year but not heavily course or damaging.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 16 weeks post relaxer (going natural).</li>
            <li> This product is recommended in natural hair posts but this is a no CAN DO for my 4c hair.</li>
            <li> ,the formula was changed in early 2012.</li>
            <li> Hair is protein, it will naturally retain</li>
            <li> I am almost 3 months natural</li>
            <li> It makes our hair soft and manageable.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been natural for about a year now and wash days always made me miss my relaxed hair.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve had no trouble with build up since I wash my hair each week with either a shampoo bar or cleansing co-wash</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve had no trouble with build up since I wash my hair each week with either a shampoo bar or cleansing co-wash conditioner.    </li>
            <li> It can be on natural or permed (relaxed) hair.</li>
            <li> I have used this on natural hair styles, but using it alone (will not provide a lot of moisture to your ends).</li>
            <li> gos)&lt;br /&gt;It dries clear and when u unravel ur twists they are soooo soft and shiny.  </li>
            <li> Anyway, I was advised NOT to do ANY chemical treatments in my hair for at LEAST 3-4 MORE WEEKS AFTER MY TOUCH-UP WAS DO!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Whether you are a natural, transitioner or touch-up extender...</li>
            <li> I have 4c natural hair &amp; it makes my hair manageable.</li>
            <li> I have been trying to embrace my naturally curly hair for a couple of months now.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m wearing my hair naturally and this products conditions well.  </li>
            <li> This detangles and leaves hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> It makes it soft on the spot.</li>
            <li> Leave it in after a shower and sleep with your hair wrapped up in a towel and leave it in until your next shower(it&#x27;ll feel weird and crusty for the day but your hair will feel so soft when you wash it out), great for repairing bleached hair</li>
            <li> I was transitioning from permed hair to natural hair.  </li>
            <li> I recommend this product to  all natural out there.</li>
            <li> It was no longer soft or shiny.  </li>
            <li> I am a natural, with the 4b/4c type of hair</li>
            <li> I read blogs on natural hair care and tips</li>
            <li> so if you can try to find it locally near you.^^</li>
            <li> (she&#x27;s almost 2 years old).</li>
            <li> I use this product as a leave it treatment and my 4a natural hair</li>
            <li> I slept in it overnight, in the morning my hair was so soft, bouncy and shiny.</li>
            <li> my hair has grown to bra band length using it with extra virgin olive oil, spring water and gentle detangling.  </li>
            <li> I started using this product when I was transitioning from relaxed to natural hair about six years ago.</li>
            <li> I have been natural for almost two years</li>
            <li> can i help them with going natural.  </li>
            <li> It leaves my hair soft and moisturized and manageable.</li>
            <li> My hair a natural texture</li>
            <li> My hair feels so soft and manageable now.</li>
            <li> it defines your curls and hair is soft all day plus you get two jars</li>
            <li> This did nothing for my natural hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a product junky as far as trying to find the &amp;#34;perfect&amp;#34; conditioner, so I tried this.  </li>
            <li> my hair feels really soft when i put it in</li>
            <li> I have natural hair and need a lot of moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> Keeps hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> Absorbs well, smells faint but good, and</li>
            <li> I do not have thick type hair but more of a medium-soft grade texture, and not a lot of frizz but do tend to have a lot of problems with hair detangle.</li>
            <li> Never been able to detangle here hair nor than 2 inches thick at a time.</li>
            <li> Her hair is very fine, with tight coils and curls and tends to get very dry.</li>
            <li> Let me just start out by saying,  i&#x27;ve tried soooo many products for my hair and none of them seemed to soften my ends or make my hair less dry.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It also claims to help with Frizz Free Hair by applying it daily to split ends or damaged areas; \\&quot;simply comb through hair, and then allow for it to dry naturally on its own.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> given that I don&#x27;t use this product as a daily moisturizer and they appear towards the end of the list, I felt reasonably secure using this product - thus far the proteins have never caused my hair to &#x27;freak out&#x27; as it has in the past when I used products with a high level of protein</li>
            <li> used Cantu LICRC on dry, co-washed, AND freshly washed hair with the same results.</li>
            <li> Being a person of Asian descent, my hair was no long shiny straight.  </li>
            <li> Also, if you mix plain yogurt, honey, olive oil, and real aloe vera gel (the real one) together, and then place in your hair as a treatment, cover and sit for 30 minutes, then wash out, your hair will be SOFT and your curls will start clumping together (a sign of moisture</li>

            <li> As always my cream came in on time and works wonderfully on my natural hair and my stuff is thick and very diffecult to manage I put large amout in and leave on overnight rinse out next day am ready for the world.</li>
            <li> The new formula has Canola Oil as the second ingredient and Shea Butter is now the sixth or seventh ingredient.  </li>
            <li> I am still fairly new at taking care of my hair and I am currently about 8 months in transition.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Apply any stand-alone regular hair conditioner with Dr Miracle&#x27;s Healing Live in Treatment and Conditioner; sit with a heating cap for about 15-20 minutes and then rinse.</li>
            <li> I received two containers of the NEW formula where shea butter is 7th and canola oil is 2nd.</li>
            <li> I decided to go natural last year because I saw a friend&#x27;s natural hair</li>
            <li> now that I have FINALLY FOUND products that work for me(*whew*), I will religiously follow my daily hair regimen</li>
            <li> now that I have FINALLY FOUND products that work for me(*whew*), I will religiously follow my daily hair regimen</li>
            <li> I am not one of those girls who can wash&#x27; fro&#x27; and go nor do my two strand twist/ blow out last more than a few hours, yes, even in the dry NYC fall/winter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have 3b/3c, fine strands, thick density, normal-high porosity hair.</li>
            <li> I have natural hair and this is the only product I use as my leave in.</li>
            <li> This is the only leave in that makes my hair soft, manageable and silky.  </li>
            <li> also sometimes if u use too much your hair will feel harder to comb tru</li>
            <li> The old formula has Shea Butter as the second ingredient.  </li>
            <li> The jars apparently had been opened before purchasing.  </li>
            <li> natural back in 2012.</li>
            <li> I wear my hair natural so moisture is key.</li>
            <li> I use it as a leave-in treatment after I deep condition and it leaves my hair feeling soft in the morning</li>
            <li> I really liked Miss Jessie&#x27;s curly pudding, but seriously, it is ridiculously expensive.</li>
            <li> Hair doesn&#x27;t seem to look any better or worse to me, but did feel softer.</li>
            <li> Overall if you have really thick dry hair and you want a little manageability this would be a great product for you.</li>
            <li> it was so hard and dry), so I am glad i have this now to use until i wash it out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still new to taking care of my hair and if I find a shampoo and deep conditioner regimen that makes my hair &amp;#34;pop&amp;#34; then I believe this product has the potential to be one of my favs.  </li>
            <li> and my ends dont dry out as much as they used to I recommend this product to freinds and anyone that asks daily.</li>
            <li> on dry hair, too much WILL leave the white residue.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m black and have worn my hair natural my whole life.</li>
            <li> first time I used it I tried it with additional leave-in treatments/styling aids and the result were less than favorable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m mixed (with black &amp; white) &amp; have super curly hair.</li>
            <li> so far i have been using this product for a week and although my hair is not natural it still makes my hair incredibly soft especially after straightening it.</li>
            <li> When I take down my twist out, I am always left with soft bouncy curls that are very defined.</li>
            <li> The one I purchased from a store does not have shea butter as the second ingredient, however I applied it last night and it did keep my hair soft and moisturized and</li>
            <li> I happened to purchase the last of the old batch from my local BSS.</li>
            <li> I am currently transitioning back to natural from being relaxed for years.</li>
            <li> you can never go wrong with shea butter and ever since i went natural this has helped keep my hair moist, healthy and has helped it grow too</li>
            <li> i s not dry at that length!&lt;br /&gt;Does</li>
            <li> My hair is a mix of 4A/B/C-- that means dry, course, brillo-like super tight coils.</li>
            <li> I notice that the permed hair from the top right side of my head broke off really bad.  </li>
            <li> I usually use about a quarter size finger full on each section of freshly washed damp hair (after it has dried a bit under a t-shirt)and add either grapeseed or olive oil to seal it; braid/twist it over night to dry.  </li>
            <li> This product keeps my hair soft all week long.</li>
            <li> Lasts long, natural cream without residue.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the difference between losing 75 percent in length to the heat versus looking like I have natural long curls which I do with Cantu.</li>
            <li> A week later I put a small amount of the Shea Butter in my hair again to help maintain moisture and it feels just as soft and silky as it did the first day again.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s a little bit higher here than in your local beauty store</li>
            <li> It is worth the money as a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> I tried this product 3 other times and it left it looking the same no matter how much of the product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this three times, each time on dry, natural hair.</li>
            <li> My hair is so much softer, produces looser curls and makes it less frizzy, I have biracial hair</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally curly and dry.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s super thick</li>
            <li> This product in my opinion failed to live up to its expectations that it would nourish, smooth and softens while protecting against damage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have long, thick wavy/curly hair that has become a lot drier over this last year or so, thanks to getting older, no doubt!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m half black and half Japanese, so my hair is very thick and is mostly s-shaped curls, some spirals underneath but with a hint of kinky as it easily</li>
            <li> thus far the proteins have never caused my hair to &#x27;freak out&#x27; as it has in the past when I used products with a high level of protein</li>
            <li> This leave in conditioning repair cream worked wonders for me, I am a 3c/4a mix with very dry locks, but this stuff in combination with an olive oil treatment cream made my hair look very shiny, soft, and professional looking to the point where I&#x27;m getting compliments all day long every day that I use it (which is everyday now!).</li>
            <li> , it was so soft and even defined my curls without any other product.</li>
            <li> I cant wait for my hair to grow so that I can try this for other  natural hairstyles.</li>
            <li> Using the hair dryer adds a little more dryness, so this is when I will spray a little Cantu Sheen Spray in my hand and shape my hair a little with my fingers, then leave it alone.&lt;br</li>

            <li> My hair feels moisturized and soft when I put it on my wet hair, but days later it feels dry.</li>
            <li> /c hair texture curly, soft &amp; cottony feel when completely dry; straw like feel when very dry.  </li>
            <li> It left my hair soft and moisturized, not weighed down or greasy.  </li>
            <li> When I took it down the next morning my hair was so soft and buttery and my curls were so defined.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have tried several other leave-in conditioners that really can&#x27;t be applied to the roots without making your hair look oily or weighing it down in the front.</li>
            <li> I am an African American female and I wash my hair almost daily due to my daily exercise routine.  </li>
            <li> washed my hair twice after and it dried unbelievably soft!!</li>
            <li> I can put this on dry or wet hair and it keeps the hair soft and moisturized all day.  </li>
            <li> I have only been wearing my hair naturally for less than a year</li>
            <li> hair is coarse and my twist outs always come out dry and parched.&lt;br /&gt;Altho this product leaves a white residue on hair (which is why I dont recommend for wash and</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m African American and have naturally dry hair</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t moisturize hair long and when it sets it leaves tons of white flakes.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it long enough yet.</li>
            <li> Its at the bottom of my bra strap when curly and it reaches mid-back whenever I flat iron it.</li>
            <li> I have long asian hair.</li>
            <li> I apply the product liberally to damp hair, detangle from tips to root, seal with coconut oil, and flat twist.  </li>
            <li> Last, I apply a tiny bit of coconut oil on my ends to seal them, and braid my hair into a loose bun.  </li>
            <li> It also allows me to leave my hair down as it enhances the natural waves in my hair.</li>
            <li> When I was little my hair would stay short due to it being very breakable ans brittle.</li>
            <li> I have found (now being completely natural) that a lot of those curl creams cause your hair to be initially soft, but then hard once it dries.</li>
            <li> I rarely write review and such about other products negatively.  </li>
            <li> My hair was still dry after using it and even after using it as a deep conditioner.</li>
            <li> This stuff is a must have for coarse, dry hair.  </li>
            <li> I am black and have natural hair</li>
            <li> when I leave it to dry naturally, I&#x27;m  definitely going to buy it again.</li>
            <li> My hair is always extremely dry in the summer months, and this product totally alleviates that problem.</li>
            <li> i have natural hair and when i used this product it made my hair feel coarse after a blow dried it, i have not used it again since</li>
            <li> It softens my natural hair and it only requires a little to go a long way.  </li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve bleached, dyed &amp; highlighted my hair for several years causing it to be straw dry!</li>
            <li> I have wandered off and tried numerous other products but always  come back to Cantu shea butter.</li>
            <li> highly recommend this product, especially for naturals with hard to manage hair.</li>
            <li> Apply it dry as a daily styling regiment (with blow dry or curling/</li>
            <li> But I also try to keep my hair a bit stretched as well.</li>
            <li> If your hair is wet when you put it in, it tends to ldry with white flaky stuff in your hair.  </li>
            <li> My hair was so soft and fluffy.</li>
            <li> Plus, it lasts for a long time.  </li>
            <li> However, be prepared, your hair will be sticky all day long....</li>
            <li> I agree with other reviews stating this does not mix well with other products and curling sprays...at least not until the condioner has completely absorbed into the hair...like the next day.  </li>
            <li> got lots of straight hair with volume, so as long as the oil is thick in consistency</li>
            <li> but it left my hair so dry!!</li>
            <li> However if here is wet when you put it in, it tends to dry with white flaky stuff in your hair, so you have to keep rubbing it through out the day until it all desolves and blend into the hair.</li>
            <li> I use it on my wet hair after washing, on dry hair before a twist out, and daily just to keep it moisturized.</li>
            <li> Long story, short; it became sooo messed up, it was coming out in balls of yarn straw!</li>
            <li> It mixed well with my other products too.</li>
            <li> It left little white balls all over my head</li>
            <li> I always use the cantu cowash with this too and my hair is unbelievable soft!</li>
            <li> While other products have come and gone since I was 16, the ONE thing I&#x27;ve kept in stock (when possible... at one point, Cantu leave-in was MIA), even now at 23, is this conditioner.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other products such as olive oil shampoos/conditioners and nothing worked quite as well as this!</li>
            <li> Her hair is not processed but very long.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;used it on my dry crispy roller set hair (done in salon 4 days ago and bugging me cos</li>
            <li> My hair has the tendency to get dry and brittle and I experience breakage.</li>
            <li> squeeze out my hair in the shower, do not towel dry.</li>
            <li> have curly and dry hair</li>
            <li> So on my dry hair, I put a generous handful of this, as well as coconut oil.</li>
            <li> I had used treseme naturals conditioner as a leave in but it made my hair dry.</li>
            <li> If you have dry or unmanageable hair this product it the product you want.</li>
            <li> This made my hair really dry</li>
            <li> I have extremely dry caucasian hair.</li>
            <li> then I blow dry my hair without rinsing it out.</li>
            <li> Let it air dry.</li>
            <li> My hair is not chemically treated and I use this cream after I co-wash my hair before I dry it.</li>
            <li> My hair was breaking and felt incredibly dry all of the time.</li>
            <li> My hair is so dry and unmanageable</li>
            <li> one year old son usually cringe when I comb is hair.</li>
            <li> After loosing all of my hair it grew back extremely curly short tight curls&lt;</li>
            <li> It left my hair dry and brittle ALL THE TIME!!!!</li>
            <li> Use while hair is wet and let dry to get hair to curl without the frizzies.</li>
            <li> product can be applied dry or to wet hair&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dry:</li>
            <li> Works on wet or dry hair.  </li>
            <li> went to Cannes Film festival last month, and I took big portion of this but was still anxious of running out.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It just didn&#x27;t penetrate my hair, whether wet or dry.</li>
            <li> Sometimes, I will lie on my bed on my back and let my hair hang off the edge of the bed for a few minutes just to keep it still and let it dry.</li>
            <li> Every single time!</li>
            <li> my hair was still the same; dry, brittle, dull and and very coarse.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it for 2 weeks now, so I don&#x27;t know if it is actually &amp;#34;repairing&amp;#34; anything yet, but I would dfinitely recommend this product for those of you looking for a solution to dry dull hair.</li>
            <li> This little concoction brought my hair back to life.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> After I deep conditioning my hair would be a little rough to handle ( I have 4c hair).  </li>
            <li> And after a month my hair is no longer dry, breaking off and is growing again due to not breaking off.</li>
            <li> Naturally it is course and hard to comb.</li>
            <li> I seriously cannot live without this stuff</li>
            <li> Love this product but it was badly packaged when I got it, it was leaking.</li>
            <li> but once again it was a huge disappointment.</li>
            <li> I have now been no-heat natural for 6 mo &amp; am not as naive as I was when I began my no chemicals (perms/relaxers) hair journey</li>
            <li> I apply this product to my wet, already washed and conditioned hair.</li>
            <li> After washing and towel-drying my hair, I use a wide tooth comb and pin my hair into sections.</li>
            <li> I wet my hair and comb through</li>
            <li> got my bro to start using it in his hair be careful.</li>
            <li> this makes your hair wet , it not a lotion so use after u wash ur hair.</li>
            <li> and I tend to wet my hair every morening, apply a palm sized amount and let it sit.</li>
            <li> Ensure that hair is not soak and wet, but damp when you apply it.</li>
            <li> The product was as expected.</li>
            <li> Softeners are harder to be degraded than detergents in general.&lt;br /&gt;Most</li>
            <li> Every day I wet and comb through my hair in the shower.</li>
            <li> You can also just use as a base, and add your personal favorite products to it.</li>
            <li> is if you apply it on wet hair it will dry a little white and flake (a little water as it starts to dry takes care of that)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I would yield the same results if I used it on dry hair.</li>
            <li> A little bit of this, goes a long way because you only need a little bit.</li>
            <li> Its also thick enough to allow me to add other essential oils to it.</li>
            <li> It was difficult to get the right products for my afro.</li>
            <li> I often do regular &#x60;leave-in&#x27; conditioning treatments about 2x&#x27;s a week; I prefer to stay away from a lot of hot ironing/curling to my hair or using Platinum base curlers which in my opinion will only damage the hair for short and long-term usage.</li>
            <li> It is flat and round and comes with a diffuser attachment.</li>
            <li> It is flat and round and comes with a diffuser attachment.</li>
            <li> It works well when used regularly and sometimes I will even mix some in with raw shea butter.</li>
            <li> I feel my hair less dry</li>
            <li> typically let my hair air dry from there.</li>
            <li> This conditioner doesn&#x27;t work very well as it is so greasy and very difficult to rinse out completely.  </li>
            <li> Does not mix well with other products, tend to make it harder to detangle when mix with other products.</li>
            <li> I can use just a little bit of it per use, so one jar lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;*doesn&#x27;t work well with other products</li>
            <li> Just started using it, so maybe I&#x27;ll notice other results over time.</li>
            <li> If you are going to combine it with any other product</li>
            <li> and I read that it doesn&#x27;t mix well with other products.</li>
            <li> All this product does is shrink your hair, and I mean major shrinkage.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t mix well with other products, so if I want some hold, I found that it works well with Pantene ProV curly gel (it can be drying tho)</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t get those small white lumps.</li>
            <li> and I feel compelled to buy every product that has curl on the label, but I usually find myself coming back to this.  </li>
            <li> and I even mix it with other products.  </li>
            <li> The only reason I&#x27;m giving it a 4 star instead of 5, is because I&#x27;m not sure what the long-term condition of my hair will be in from using this.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait to try other products in the Cantu line.</li>
            <li> I even tried to mix it with other products</li>
            <li> I have extremely curly hair</li>
            <li> I like this because, unlike other products, you don&#x27;t have to use a ton of it.  </li>
            <li> bought some other shea butter based hairlotion with this</li>
            <li> gave the other bottle to my daughter.  </li>
            <li> morning routine consists of spraying her hair with a little water, then adding the Mixed Chicks leave in and a little bit of this leave in an combing through.</li>
            <li> I use it everytime i shampoo my hair and a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> With this product, I have been asked by other</li>
            <li> and I sometimes mix it with castor oil if my hair is extremely dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It finally didn&#x27;t feel like a dead mass on my head anymore!</li>
            <li> Would definitely recommend for transitioners, naturals, and anyone with thick, dry hair!</li>
            <li> and I know how difficult it is to manage natural hair (especially the 4b/4c type).</li>
            <li> I use this after shampooing and or conditioning my hair, I add a little bit of this on each section before i use a wide tooth comb (to detangle my hair).</li>
            <li> My jar lasts a long time, and I wash my hair usually once a week.</li>
            <li> I am a white girl with course, thick hair.  </li>
            <li> I was forced to buy it when I ran out of my regular leave-in.</li>
            <li> But this if used on dry hair will leave white residue behind.</li>
            <li> hair down.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want to weigh my hair down, I want to moisturize and define the curl.</li>
            <li> By the end of May 2013, I broke down and bought it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s now listed farther down the list.</li>
            <li> and I will not have to worry about hunting it down at the store.</li>
            <li> It will weigh down your hair.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> , I hold the bottle upside down shaking n tapping the bottom</li>
            <li> Her method was to just gel it down and tie it up.</li>
            <li> Even after using salon leave in conditioners and products, this bests it hands down.</li>
            <li> I spent years finding products to help tame my hair and weigh it down, but I realized...</li>
            <li> Other than that it makes her hair hard, if I put it on and then blow dry afterwards.</li>
            <li> less breakage.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;PS in places like Target &amp; Walmart, this item was about $6/7, or less for one.</li>
            <li> The less I handle it,</li>
            <li> the less frizz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The less I handle it,</li>
            <li> the less frizz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I get less shrinkage from cowashing.</li>
            <li> The consistency is less fluent and not as mosturizing.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s softer, and it&#x27;s way less fuzzy.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s even less degradable than shampoo.</li>
            <li> I only use conditioner when my hair is in serious tangle, like after surfing.&lt;br</li>
            <li> day, my hair looks slept in and slightly waxy</li>
            <li> Results within less than a week.  </li>
            <li> shea buter\\&quot; have it as the #6 ingredient which means less shea butter.  </li>
            <li> but it leaves a white residue and my hair gets hard and stiff within a few hours.</li>
            <li> But still hard to comb through when dry.</li>
            <li> it was always brittle, dull, dry and kinda stuck</li>
            <li> I counteract this by adding a little water or another spray conditioner that I have, to break up the residue.  </li>
            <li> I applied a little bit of this on his damp hair and when I combed the comb when through effortlessly.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> but my trick is I rub a little olive oil in my palms and massage it through my hair and that takes care of it).</li>
            <li> Without weighing your hair down!  </li>
            <li> Moisturizes without leaving hair too heavy</li>
            <li> All of them dried out my hair and they we falling out.</li>
            <li> I use this product everyday for my hair type 4C</li>
            <li> It just made my hair feel heavy</li>
            <li> So, I gave this product three stars because of its limitibility and a few harsh ingredients.</li>
            <li> great&lt;br /&gt;*doesn&#x27;t contain any harsh chemicals</li>
            <li> It is also a bit heavy.</li>
            <li> It is a bit greasy to the touch but doesn&#x27;t feel heavy or weighed</li>
            <li> It feel sticky and quite too heavy on hair</li>
            <li> - it&#x27;s thin enough where there are no flakes</li>
            <li> If she has a puff or a few pig tails, I seal her edges with the Cantu pomade.</li>
            <li> Its great...not sticky, gummy or heavy to the hair...unless you over saturate your hair which will lead to product build up.  </li>
            <li> wouldn&#x27;t say it was a waste of money at $6, but it just didn&#x27;t work for my hair(4A relaxed).</li>
            <li> and I find that the Cantu Shea Butter Leave in Cream is too heavy for my hair type.  </li>
            <li> so I wouldn&#x27;t waste</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very heavy and leaves our hair matted down after being slept on once.  </li>
            <li> Coloring and flat iron make it worse.  </li>
            <li> not a good product for softening the hair - used it and my hair was hard the next mornig</li>
            <li> My hair doesn&#x27;t take well to moisture with water based products, including plain &#x27;ole water.</li>
            <li> That waxy feel &amp; residue is why I hated it when I first tried it alone as a leave-in when flat ironing my hair.</li>
            <li> I cannot say that this product is not great for natural hair, it just was not a great product for my transitional hair.</li>
            <li> For both of us it had very little slip, which my son doesn&#x27;t appreciate nor do I.</li>
            <li> It didnt make my hair hard when it dried, either.</li>
            <li> Now not sure what the difference is or if they just changed the container and formula, but i prefer this</li>
            <li> I tried using it for a twist out, after washing and before adding my extensions and eventually I ended up giving it to a friend who was anxious to try it.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not magic.</li>
            <li> Everybody&#x27;s hair is different or maybe just combined it with the wrong products.</li>
            <li> I used it as a leave in conditioner but leaves hair feeling patched and not smooth at all!</li>
            <li> I prefer to use a Titanium coated barrel and keep the setting no more than a medium type temperature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I usually buy from walmart or target (if they have it in stock).</li>
            <li> I suspect that this conditioner is for African Americans and wish that would have been clarified on the Amazon description as I wouldn&#x27;t have bought it then because I think my hair is the wrong texture for this product.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually write reviews</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical since I had tried several products that didn&#x27;t work..</li>
            <li> I no longer have painful tangles &amp; after a couple of months my hair is much longer.. quicker than usual.</li>
            <li> but on perm hair to me it makes the hair stiff and hard..</li>
            <li> It even helped mend some of the damage that was done from a few awful deep conditioners that left my hair dry and tangled.</li>
            <li> Very messy</li>
            <li> I am Black and have very, very thick hair that I texturize.</li>
            <li> and it had my hair feeling stiff, not good as a leave in or rinse out</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s hard to want to buy anything else anyway.</li>
            <li> Course, nappy, hard to manage hair.</li>
            <li> I was so unhappy with how my hair felt that I re-washed it two-days later as I did not like the texture of my hair.</li>
            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had heard extremely negative reviews of this product but then realized that the reviews were written between 2008 - 2012</li>
            <li> and there is no build up (at least not for us).</li>
            <li> Now my edges are burned off my thick hair.</li>
            <li> My hair&#x27;s thick &amp; course and needs all the conditioning it can get.</li>
            <li> for girls with thin hair it might be too heavy.</li>
            <li> tried the curling cream on her hair and it was too thick.</li>
            <li> I mean</li>
            <li> Also the new formula is terrible, my hair is always dry and crunchy!</li>
            <li> My hair is fuzzy, fluffy, brittle at the ends (horrible, I know), and in certain places - like the ends and edges</li>
            <li> that is ridiculous</li>
            <li> Seriously, I am a guy</li>
            <li> and you get that subtle coconut smell ALL day.</li>
            <li> But unfortunatly, the last time I got one which was damaged, it was opened and a lot of the product was spelled out :(</li>
            <li> and it is very hard for me to comb.</li>
            <li> The containers weren&#x27;t broken, but some of the conditioner was leaking out.</li>
            <li> and if I used another product, it made it worse.</li>
            <li> I received the product with the broken lid.</li>
            <li> really wanted to like this, but it leaves the worst residue in the hair</li>
            <li> I then blow dried my hair (using the cold setting) to help everything set.</li>
            <li> have always hated that my hair is so BIG.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, this was not for that use</li>
            <li> (Look in Walmart/Target for this product too, not as expensive)</li>
            <li> Sorry for the caps.</li>
            <li> I have a tendency to use up a product even if I&#x27;m not impressed with it.  </li>
            <li> So sad.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately the products that worked for my friend did not work for me</li>
            <li> Sadly, I did not get the moisturizing results others have reported.</li>
            <li> Not impressed by this prod</li>
            <li> I have never written a bad review, or hardly any reviews for that matter!</li>
            <li> the smell isnt too bad and is very subtle.</li>
            <li> so it needs moisture desperately.</li>
            <li> I am so mad.  </li>
            <li> am changing my hair regimen because I&#x27;ve always heard that hair grease is bad for your hair, but...</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe how bad my ends felt after using this.</li>
            <li> The consistency and ingredients in this all-natural (I&#x27;ve checked the ingredients AND the chemicals--remember, you&#x27;re made of chemicals, and you&#x27;re not so bad) will repair any hair type and add moisture in or out of the shower.&lt;br /&gt;4) BUY IT.</li>
            <li> I needed a leave in conditioner badly.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like this product at all :(</li>
            <li> That was very unpleasant.</li>
            <li> I absolutely hated this when I had relaxed hair</li>
            <li> I hated this.</li>
            <li> and I have not been disappointed yet!</li>
            <li> However, I was very disappointed</li>
            <li> horrible.. weighed my daughters</li>
            <li> HORRIBLE!!!</li>
            <li> Worst leave in conditioner ever!!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have natural hair and this is the only product I use as my leave in. I have wandered off and tried numerous other products but always  come back to Cantu shea butter. So now I have stopped cheating on Cantu ☺. Plus it works great on my hair.....that&#x27;s the plus!</li>
            <li> Moisturizes without leaving hair too heavy</li>
            <li> Odie el olor, me produce nauseas, no lo tolere aunque al cabello le cae super bien.</li>
            <li> One of the containers was open when I received it and lost 1/2 of the product.</li>
            <li> i love this product and it smell deliciously</li>
            <li> There are several of these containers around with different second ingredients. The first ingredient is always water, which is what you want, but Shea butter is NOT the second ingredient. The one I purchased from a store does not have shea butter as the second ingredient, however I applied it last night and it did keep my hair soft and moisturized and manageable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am changing my hair regimen because I&#x27;ve always heard that hair grease is bad for your hair, but...I couldn&#x27;t let go. I FINALLY have broken free of my grease.</li>
            <li> I was playing with my moms natural hair and noticed it was incredibly soft. When she mentioned this product, I went out and bought it immediately. I had to have it. That night my boyfriend touched my relaxed hair and said \\&quot;Wow! Your hair is soft... really soft\\&quot; It&#x27;s a great, inexpensive, non-greasy leave in that&#x27;s definitely worth trying.</li>
            <li> My daughter has noticed a change in the way her hair feels since using the Cantu line.  She is ecstatic about the way her natural hair looks and it has helped me to see her vision, as well.</li>
            <li> I bought some of this from walmart &amp; it works AMAZING. I&#x27;m mixed (with black &amp; white) &amp; have super curly hair. This made my curls look beautiful I literally couldn&#x27;t stop looking at myself in the mirror. I didn&#x27;t use that much &amp; it works awesome. This jar should last me awhile &amp; it runs out I will definitely get more. You absolutely can&#x27;t beat this low price!</li>
            <li> I was out of town and needed a conditioner so I picked this up.  I can put this on dry or wet hair and it keeps the hair soft and moisturized all day.  It doesn&#x27;t leave any residue, not stiff and the smell is pleasant.</li>
            <li> I used this product before but then i couldnt find it anymor. I use it to control my frizz and moisture my hair!! Its great after the fist time of using it I feel my hair less dry and my frizz was in great control I dont even use mouse anymore!!!</li>
            <li> My newly natural curly hair LOVES this leave in conditioner! It makes my hair soft and easy to comb through. It works well with my color treated hair and, it smells sooooooooooooo good! When I use it regularly, I notice my hair is stronger with less breakage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product, especially for naturals with hard to manage hair.</li>
            <li> horrible.. weighed my daughters hair down.</li>
            <li> The only thing good about cantu shea products are the prices, other than that they suck. The leave in conditioner is drying it is not at all creamy or slippery enough. For the life of me I do not know why people like this product so much.</li>
            <li> This does not work on my hair and I had to end up giving it away. My hair was still dry after using it and even after using it as a deep conditioner. There have been many great reviews about this product but it does not work for everyone&#x27;s natural hair...sigh....still looking...</li>
            <li> This stuff is GREAT, so nourishing, if your hair is dry you need this. It dries light on your hair, but is very moisturizing. It&#x27;s not at all sticky when it dries, so many of the &amp;#34;leave in&amp;#34; products feel stiff or oily, but the Cantu Shea Butter is awesome. Smells good, too.</li>
            <li> Let me just start out by saying,  i&#x27;ve tried soooo many products for my hair and none of them seemed to soften my ends or make my hair less dry. This leave in conditioner is just a MIRACLE it leaves your hair super soft and shiny ! Without weighing your hair down!  Please give it a try !</li>
            <li> I am transitioning and I use this product for my braid outs. My hair feels moisturized and soft when I put it on my wet hair, but days later it feels dry. I like the results it gives for my braid outs, but I don&#x27;t think it is a great moisturizing conditioner.</li>
            <li> The only good thing I have to say about this product is that it smells good. It doesn&#x27;t moisturize hair long and when it sets it leaves tons of white flakes. HORRIBLE!!!</li>
            <li> It smells really nice.. and keep my daughter hair moisturize and even enhance her curls a little .. but on perm hair to me it makes the hair stiff and hard..</li>
            <li> Absolute best! Best product for my 4c hair, hair feels soft and wonderful!</li>
            <li> Hi this is a good product from a timely and diligent seller. I recently started caring for my hair and this moisturizer is good stuff. i would definitely reccomend</li>
            <li> I apply this product to my wet, already washed and conditioned hair. I guess I use it as a leave in conditioner.  It softens the hair and makes it manageable. However, it does leave a white residue on the hair. I counteract this by adding a little water or another spray conditioner that I have, to break up the residue.  Other than that, it&#x27;s great for moisture retention.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nov 7, 2014 edit:&lt;br /&gt;I just wanted to add to my original review. When I first wrote the review, I was a long term transitioner into natural hair. I am now fully natural, with about 7 inches of natural, 4b/c hair. There are so many products on the market, promising all types of results. And when we first start this natural hair journey, we run out and buy all of them (getting caught up in the hype, lol). Obviously some products will work better for some than for others. But I stick by my original review of this product. This product will give most naturals super soft, touchable hair. I have found (now being completely natural) that a lot of those curl creams cause your hair to be initially soft, but then hard once it dries. I suppose if you are one of those people who want super definition, and only want to twist once, and then pineapple for the rest of the week without having to re-twist, then Cantu won&#x27;t do that for you--because it has no hold. However, if you are okay with having to re-twist to keep your twist out-then I would say Cantu leave in is a superior product. I get nice soft curls when I twist with it--more like curls instead of waves. And my hair is more fluffy than super defined. But I also try to keep my hair a bit stretched as well. So everyone does what works for them. But I get so many compliments and questions about my hair. Sometimes less is more. I don&#x27;t see myself buying anymore of these so called \\&quot;curl creams\\&quot; with the exception of shea moisture&#x27;s curl enhancing smoothie. But, cantu is worth a try if you are battling dryness. And don&#x27;t forget to try the LOC method, if dryness is really a problem for you. Also, if you mix plain yogurt, honey, olive oil, and real aloe vera gel (the real one) together, and then place in your hair as a treatment, cover and sit for 30 minutes, then wash out, your hair will be SOFT and your curls will start clumping together (a sign of moisture retention).is really a problem for you.

            <li> just on intial open-and-sniff... i love the smell&lt;br /&gt;it was very light and not thick like the other Cantu Shea Butter for natural hair leave in conditioning i got from a store. I love that. Now not sure what the difference is or if they just changed the container and formula, but i prefer this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;used it on my dry crispy roller set hair (done in salon 4 days ago and bugging me cos it was so hard and dry), so I am glad i have this now to use until i wash it out.</li>
            <li> The only hair product I use on my curls, hydrating without being sticky/slimy or dandruffy.</li>
            <li> Love this product but it was badly packaged when I got it, it was leaking.</li>
            <li> I used to use hair jell. All of them dried out my hair and they we falling out. I just wanted something that would hold my hair in place, but not ruin them. This fit the job.</li>
            <li> Love this product. perfect for natural hair, recommend it to all.  I use this product everyday for my hair type 4C and I absolutely love it and my hair loves it as well.</li>
            <li> not a good product for softening the hair - used it and my hair was hard the next mornig</li>
            <li> FYI, I have 4b/c hair texture curly, soft &amp; cottony feel when completely dry; straw like feel when very dry.  When I was beginning my no chemicals (aka no perms/relaxers) hair journey, I initially was looking for a protective product to apply to my hair before straightening it, in order to moisturize and protect it.  Needless to say, this was not for that use (I later discovered the miracle of good heat protectors). I have now been no-heat natural for 6 mo &amp; am not as naive as I was when I began my no chemicals (perms/relaxers) hair journey 2 1/2 yrs ago.  I now use this product mostly as an ingredient in my own deep conditioner concoction (which includes other conditioners, coconut &amp; olive oil, honey, etc.) and it works well together.  I do notice that it can have a waxy feel as well as left over residue when used alone as a leave in conditioner(maybe try adding another conditioner product in addition to this if u don&#x27;t like the feel of it alone as a leave-in).  That waxy feel &amp; residue is why I hated it when I first tried it alone as a leave-in when flat ironing my hair. Overall though, its a good product for sealing in &amp; moisturizing the hair no matter how u use it, &amp; a good product for the price(not this price, though).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS in places like Target &amp; Walmart, this item was about $6/7, or less for one. I recommend looking there first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PPS However, if you&#x27;re looking for a great leave-in you can absolutely use alone (or in deep conditioners, or as a detangler, a wash-out conditioner, &amp; more)that leaves no waxiness or residue I would really recommend my fav [[ASIN:B00128WK4I Kinky-Curly Knot Today Leave In Conditioner/Detangler - 8 oz]]  (Look in Walmart/Target for this product too, not as expensive)</li>
            <li> Smells so good but it leaves white stuff in you&#x27;re hair when you use with something else. I use OGX coconut milk anti breakage serum and my hair always has white stuff in it! Also the new formula is terrible, my hair is always dry and crunchy! Will be handing this off to someone else and going back to Shea Moisture 😔</li>
            <li> I seriously cannot live without this stuff</li>
            <li> After reading all the good reviews I thought I would love it. But shea moistures is way better. I tried using it for a twist out, after washing and before adding my extensions and eventually I ended up giving it to a friend who was anxious to try it. It just made my hair feel heavy like there was a grease build up.</li>
            <li> I use this on my daughters&#x27; hair. Was a great two pack buy! Thanks!</li>
            <li> LOOOVE THIS PRODUCT! great for natural hair and is much cheaper online than in stores! love, love, love! cantu is one of my favorite lines for natural hair</li>
            <li> I rarely write review and such about other products negatively.  However, this is a cautionary tale. This product has burned my hair.  I have 4b hair and I had but an oil and shea butter then applied to damp hair. Now my edges are burned off my thick hair. I am so mad.  You can NOT layer with this product.</li>
            <li> Ok im a natural girl. I thought this would work with all the good reviews but it left my hair so dry!! I couldn&#x27;t believe how bad my ends felt after using this. I thought I could try it on my kids hair because they have very different hair types than me (biracial kids) but NOPE! not even on their hair was this a good product. If this works for you good for you but it was 0-3 for me.</li>
            <li> I am Black and have very, very thick hair that I texturize. My hair has the tendency to get dry and brittle and I experience breakage. This product.... is the GREATEST THING EVER! After washing and towel-drying my hair, I use a wide tooth comb and pin my hair into sections. Next, I run this repair cream through my hair, concentrating on my ends. Last, I apply a tiny bit of coconut oil on my ends to seal them, and braid my hair into a loose bun.  When I wake up in the morning, my hair is soft, silky, moisturized, shiny. Every single time! I only use it on clean, damp hair. I&#x27;m not sure if I would yield the same results if I used it on dry hair. PLEASE, GO AHEAD AND BUY THIS SO YOU CAN UNDERSTAND WHAT I&#x27;M TALKING ABOUT! A+ :)</li>
            <li> I absolutely hated this when I had relaxed hair but when I went natural. OMG. The best leave in conditioner ever, it was so soft and even defined my curls without any other product. I put olive oil on my hair before applyin the product and it was heaven</li>
            <li> Leaves your hair soft and managable. Great for transitioners like me. The smell is phenomenal as well, coconut and shea butter.</li>
            <li> Yes this product is great for 4a/4b hair...which is mine, but this price is a no no...go to Walmart or target to get your deals....it&#x27;s only being sold for under 7$ any higher than that is ridiculous</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve finally found a product that agrees with my hair.  This is a great conditioner- makes my hair so soft.</li>
            <li> This is my first purchase of any Cantu products and this one is AMAZING. I never knew my hair could be so soft and wavy without blow drying. Its also great for gel styling to add extra moisture. I am impressed and in love.</li>
            <li> My hair is 3b/3c. I&#x27;m half black and half Japanese, so my hair is very thick and is mostly s-shaped curls, some spirals underneath but with a hint of kinky as it easily frizzes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have always hated that my hair is so BIG. I spent years finding products to help tame my hair and weigh it down, but I realized...my hair IS big. It&#x27;s going to be that way, and that is the point of going natural. So that changed my ideas of what I needed in hair care products. I don&#x27;t want to weigh my hair down, I want to moisturize and define the curl. Since I&#x27;ve had that epiphany, I&#x27;ve been so much happer with my hair. I get lots of compliments, and my hair care regimen can&#x27;t be easier! Here is what I do:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shampoo:&lt;br /&gt;I use Creme of Nature sulfate-free Argan Oil Shampoo once every two weeks. (My curls are at their best when it&#x27;s been a while since I&#x27;ve shampooed but the products build up on the scalp.) Since it is sulfate free, it doesn&#x27;t lather up much. I like the shampoo because my hair doesn&#x27;t feel stripped I shampoo, comb through with a wide-tooth comb while rinsing out. I do not use a conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(If I don&#x27;t shampoo, I still start here daily...I wet my hair and comb through daily.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Style:&lt;br /&gt;I squeeze out my hair in the shower, do not towel dry. From there, I spray some Cantu Coconut Milk spray on my hair and run through with my fingers. This stuff smells awesome and it adds extra moisture. I use a comb to part my hair where I want it. Then I slather on the Cantu leave-in conditioning cream liberally by running through with my fingers in sections on top, and then run my fingers through underneath, keeping the part where I want it. The more cream I use, the more defined the curls are when they dry, but they also aren&#x27;t crispy at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dry:&lt;br /&gt;I typically let my hair air dry from there. The top dries flatter and the ends curl up and get thicker as they dry.  Sometimes, I will lie on my bed on my back and let my hair hang off the edge of the bed for a few minutes just to keep it still and let it dry. The less I handle it, the less frizz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I&#x27;m going somewhere immediately and want dryer hair, I use my pancake hair dryer. Best invention ever! I bought it here on Amazon, Conair Curl Fusion Ionic Ceramic hair dryer. It is flat and round and comes with a diffuser attachment. I bend forward and gently scrunch my hair into the diffuser and hold the dryer still. Doing this adds volume so I have a fuller, more rounded shape, and it dries the curls quickly. They are pretty defined. I only dry my hair halfway so that I can shape my hair the way I want it and let it dry on its own. Using the hair dryer adds a little more dryness, so this is when I will spray a little Cantu Sheen Spray in my hand and shape my hair a little with my fingers, then leave it alone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used many products on my hair from the cheaper Africa&#x27;s Best, to Carol&#x27;s Daughter, to Mixed Chicks and also Miss Jessie&#x27;s. I find that this mix of Cantu products is the best I&#x27;ve found so far, for so much cheaper than the ones I&#x27;ve mentioned above. I really liked Miss Jessie&#x27;s curly pudding, but seriously, it is ridiculously expensive.the edge of the bed for a few minutes just to keep it still and let it dry.

            <li> I actually bought this for my Appaloosa. He has a Beautiful long tail (which doesn&#x27;t come about very often) Naturally it is course and hard to comb. I used this product once and was pleasantly surprised as how soft his tail felt and how easily the tangles combed out.&lt;br /&gt;His tail still blew around in the wind so it didn&#x27;t seem &amp;#34;heavy&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I honestly love this stuff !!! I have un-relaxed hair and this is an awesome leave in for keeping it moisturized. Smells awesome as well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used several products in the Cantu line. This is a very good leave in. The Cantu leave in conditioner is great for moisture and it leaves my hair very soft and manageable. Just apply after a co-wash before styling with gel or twisting.</li>
            <li> My hair&#x27;s thick &amp; course and needs all the conditioning it can get. This stuff works great! It really moisturizes my hair well. My hair&#x27;s much softer than before. But still hard to comb through when dry. This stuff is great.. but it&#x27;s not magic.</li>
            <li> This product worked amazingly for me! After one use my hair felt silky and had so much shine. I leave it in over night under a hair cap once every week, and I have noticed that I don&#x27;t have as many split ends and I also don&#x27;t shed as much! Overall, I love this product, but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend buying it off of amazon because it&#x27;s about half the price if you buy it from Wal-Mart.</li>
            <li> I am a white girl with course, thick hair.  This is the only leave in that makes my hair soft, manageable and silky.  I can use just a little bit of it per use, so one jar lasts a long time.  Great stuff!!</li>
            <li> I like the way it smells and the way it makes my hair feel.  Will buy again.  Does not require you to use a lot of it.</li>
            <li> It came fast and as expected the product was Great.... I use it all the time, I love it so much</li>
            <li> I love this product for my daughters&#x27; 3c and 4b hair. And even mine. This stuff is light weight but does the job. It is so darn inexpensive it&#x27;s hard to want to buy anything else anyway. Compared to Shea Naturals leave in, I choose this one.</li>
            <li> Everybody&#x27;s hair is different or maybe just combined it with the wrong products. Honestly, this product just sits on my hair. I have another shea butter leave in conditioner that I use that works great and makes my hair curly without scrunching up or cause frizz. This product however doesnt make my hair curl no matter how much i scrunch, it made my hair very stringy and puffy. I will not buy this product anymore.</li>
            <li> love it makes here soft it smells fablous, got my bro to start using it in his hair be careful. this makes your hair wet , it not a lotion so use after u wash ur hair. also sometimes if u use too much your hair will feel harder to comb tru</li>
            <li> Makes hair nice and moist. However if here is wet when you put it in, it tends to dry with white flaky stuff in your hair, so you have to keep rubbing it through out the day until it all desolves and blend into the hair.</li>
            <li> i have bleach blonde hair and i put this stuff on while sunbathing by the pool today--washed my hair twice after and it dried unbelievably soft!! highly highly recommend it for curly haired girls who need to condition and defrizz!</li>
            <li> This stuff is a must have for coarse, dry hair.  I find that my hair is much more manageable and styles hold better when I use this product.  It is worth the money as a little goes a long way.  Not too oily but definitely adds moisture.</li>
            <li> leaves my hair moisturized and tamed ( 3c curly hair)</li>
            <li> Omg the best moisturizing leave in conditioner EVER! I&#x27;ve switched to this brand recently and I&#x27;ve been recommending it to everyone I know</li>
            <li> If your hair is wet when you put it in, it tends to ldry with white flaky stuff in your hair.  Very messy</li>
            <li> I have tried many different products on my bi-racial kids hair but nothing seemed to keep the moisture in their hair.  A worker at a local hair shop suggested I try this and I absolutely love it.  They put it in after washing their hair and then on days when they don&#x27;t wash their hair, they just comb a little through and it works great!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s mineral oil free (excellent), it leaves dry hair moisturized and manageable.  Would 100% recommend for curly, dry, chemically damaged, ethnic hair as part of a good hair care routine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a year or more and the results have been consistent. It does moisturizes my hair and makes it feel soft and manageable. It doesn&#x27;t provide a whole lot of shine but enough to notice a difference. What i don&#x27;t like about this product is that sometimes it leaves a white residue on the hair so you&#x27;ll have to watch how much you use. Also you probably don&#x27;t want to use it with gel or similar products for the same reason. Overall if you have really thick dry hair and you want a little manageability this would be a great product for you.</li>
            <li> Simply the best. I never used something like that.&lt;br /&gt;I have curly and dry hair it was good for my No Poo routine.</li>
            <li> This product dries my hair completely. I used it as a leave in conditioner but leaves hair feeling patched and not smooth at all! Better off with something else.</li>
            <li> Shippungs great, product is great, okay value, but I&#x27;d recoomend!</li>
            <li> The Cantu Shea Butter Leave-In Conditioner and list of ingredients shown on the site is not the formulation that I received.  What I received was the new formula in the new bottle.  The old formula has Shea Butter as the second ingredient.  The new formula has Canola Oil as the second ingredient and Shea Butter is now the sixth or seventh ingredient.  New formula also has Mineral Oil in it.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair soft and manageable. It smells great. I get so many compliments when I use it.  Been using it for about a year now.</li>
            <li> I have two African children and use this on them both. It lasts forever and does a good job keeping hair moisturized. Absorbs well, smells faint but good, and great price!</li>
            <li> The product is wonderful.  The jars apparently had been opened before purchasing.  The containers weren&#x27;t broken, but some of the conditioner was leaking out.</li>
            <li> I am still fairly new at taking care of my hair and I am currently about 8 months in transition.  This was one of the first actually good conditioners I tried.  I instantly liked it because I felt like I finally was getting somewhere with good products.  It left my hair soft and moisturized, not weighed down or greasy.  It didnt make my hair hard when it dried, either. Definately not a sugar coated product.  This is a good stand along product and it seems to keep the moisture in my hair all day.  Now that I am further along in trying out products and my hair has more natural length... I think my roots need a heavier conditioner.  Like I said, I&#x27;m still new to taking care of my hair and if I find a shampoo and deep conditioner regimen that makes my hair &amp;#34;pop&amp;#34; then I believe this product has the potential to be one of my favs.  I agree with other reviews stating this does not mix well with other products and curling sprays...at least not until the condioner has completely absorbed into the hair...like the next day.  So, I gave this product three stars because of its limitibility and a few harsh ingredients. This will likely stay in my product list until I find better.</li>
            <li> As always my cream came in on time and works wonderfully on my natural hair and my stuff is thick and very diffecult to manage I put large amout in and leave on overnight rinse out next day am ready for the world. It is also fantastic for bleached hair as I am experimenting with blond color now and my ends dont dry out as much as they used to I recommend this product to freinds and anyone that asks daily.</li>
            <li> I have this set up to ship every 3 months or so and its more than enough. I have a natural hair style and I tend to wet my hair every morening, apply a palm sized amount and let it sit. Once my hair dries it is soft and manageable and smells really good. So...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;*smells great&lt;br /&gt;*doesn&#x27;t contain any harsh chemicals&lt;br /&gt;*always received it ahead of schedule&lt;br /&gt;*helps my hair grow&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;*tends to build up if you don&#x27;t wash your hair weekly&lt;br /&gt;*doesn&#x27;t work well with other products&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than those few cons its a great product and I have been ordering Cantu from Amazon for 4 years! Definitely think its worth purchasing!</li>
            <li> I am black and have natural hair and I love this conditioning cream!! I love to use this after washing my hair and right before a twist out. When I take down my twist out, I am always left with soft bouncy curls that are very defined. Smells good too, but please don&#x27;t pay 18 bucks for this.</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner for my hair it leave is soft and moisturized for upto 4 duals after washing, it is also a great detangler!</li>
            <li> I have 3b/3c, fine strands, thick density, normal-high porosity hair. I use this product for my braidouts and twistouts with fabulously consistent results. It gives me great definition and keeps my hair moisturized, but doesn&#x27;t provide hold like a gel would. However it doesn&#x27;t claim to. It is after all a moisturizer, not a styler! It weighs my hair down a little, but I welcome it since I deal with shrinkage. It&#x27;s very affordable and I love that I can buy it from my local drugstore/ beauty supply store. It does contain hydrolyzed wheat protein (fyi for those that are protein sensitive), but that hasn&#x27;t been a problem for me.</li>
            <li> I had heard so much about Cantu products and I&#x27;m so glad I gave it a try. this is my current leave-in and I have not been disappointed yet!</li>
            <li> There is too much wATER AND ALCOHOL IN THIS PRODUCT AND IT IS DRYING.  IT DOES NOT FEEL LIKE  GOOD CONDITIONER.  Sorry for the caps.</li>
            <li> Just ordered this to try. Got it and the lids on the jars allow the Conditioner to leak. Amazon tied them in a bag before placing them in the box to ship. I cleaned them up and gave it a try. Hair felt softer and I was surprised to find that my hair had no oily feel. Not greasy at all. Hair doesn&#x27;t seem to look any better or worse to me, but did feel softer. Just started using it, so maybe I&#x27;ll notice other results over time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a year now, and I&#x27;ve finally figured out the best way to use it (for me anyway).  Instead of applying it to my hair after washing, I use it as part of my deep conditioning routine.  So on my dry hair, I put a generous handful of this, as well as coconut oil.</li>
            <li> It came a day earlier than predicted which is awesome! It smells amazing like vanilla-coconut the texture is smooth and creamy like lotion. I have yet to use it but i&#x27;m excited! I cant believe for 13 bucks i got two! they should last awhile</li>
            <li> It does a good job as a leave in conditioner. If you are going to combine it with any other product it&#x27;s best to put the Cantu Shea Butter on first and let your hair dry up to 80% then apply curling or twisting product. Otherwise your hair will be full of white residue.</li>
            <li> I use this product daily. Once in the morning and depending if my hair is being stubborn before bed, I&#x27;ll use it again. My hair is stronger and softer than ever before. This product is a must try! I never travel without it.</li>
            <li> Smells good but leaves a white residue on the hair when it dries.  I&#x27;ve resorted to using and rinsing it out after shampooing because it does detangle, I just don&#x27;t like the white, ashy look.</li>
            <li> Great product to control curly hair. Use while hair is wet and let dry to get hair to curl without the frizzies.</li>
            <li> a good product for my hair type 4b</li>
            <li> I am currently loving Cantu natural hair products. This leave-in conditioner really leaves my hair moisturized. I use it on a daily basis for braid outs.</li>
            <li> I love to use this leave in conditioner.. It makes my hair really soft and very curly.  I use this product on my baby&#x27;s hair also.</li>
            <li> Cantu please. I adore this leave in. I went. natural back in 2012. I had used treseme naturals conditioner as a leave in but it made my hair dry. So I was on the hunt for something better. Both of m sisters said that they really liked cantu, so I went online and I read that it doesn&#x27;t mix well with other products. Because of that i didn&#x27;t buy it. By the end of May 2013, I broke down and bought it. OMG i am so glad that i did because it is fantastic. It mixed well with my other products too. My hair was so soft and fluffy. Bouncy and great curl definition. It&#x27;s 2015 and we&#x27;re still together. That says a lot.</li>
            <li> Love it my curls are beautiful</li>
            <li> I had high hopes. It felt nice and creamy. It smells amazing. I&#x27;ve used this three times, each time on dry, natural hair. All this product does is shrink your hair, and I mean major shrinkage. I get less shrinkage from cowashing. Also it flakes everywhere. I don&#x27;t think this product hurts your hair. I didn&#x27;t have issues with breakage or anything. I just don&#x27;t think it does much to help it either. It just felt like I putting product that just sat on top of my hair. I could feel it when I ran my fingers through it throughout the day.</li>
            <li> NOTE: This stuff is cheaper at Wal-Mart. They have it for about $5.99, so from now on I&#x27;m buying it from there. I just thought I would mention that... This leave in conditioning repair cream worked wonders for me, I am a 3c/4a mix with very dry locks, but this stuff in combination with an olive oil treatment cream made my hair look very shiny, soft, and professional looking to the point where I&#x27;m getting compliments all day long every day that I use it (which is everyday now!). Seriously, I am a guy and I&#x27;ve got to say this cream is awesome for any dude (or chick) with a hair type similar to mine who doesn&#x27;t like spending more than 10 min in the bathroom styling their mane. Giving this 5 stars. Hope it works well for you too.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, I bought it after I did my big chop 5 months ago.  I have natural 3c/4a hair and I use this product when I do my wash an gos. I rake it through my hair and it defines my curls nicely and it has a nice smell. It doesn&#x27;t mix well with other products, so if I want some hold, I found that it works well with Pantene ProV curly gel (it can be drying tho), I get a decent hold and I don&#x27;t get those small white lumps. I am a product junkie and I feel compelled to buy every product that has curl on the label, but I usually find myself coming back to this.  It may not be for everyone but it&#x27;s cheap enough for you to give it a try.</li>
            <li> Hair feels soft but there is a bit of residue that stays in my hair that I cannot stand. It is also a bit heavy.</li>
            <li> Leaves hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> great product still use to this day and im going natural so its a great product for those ladies who are thinking of going natural or are already doing so.</li>
            <li> Amazing! My hair is so much softer, produces looser curls and makes it less frizzy, I have biracial hair and it&#x27;s perfect for it, thanks from Australia!! :) xx</li>
            <li> I have only been wearing my hair naturally for less than a year so I&#x27;m still seeing what works best for my hair and fell in love with this product. I use it on my wet hair after washing, on dry hair before a twist out, and daily just to keep it moisturized. It smells great and I love how creamy it is.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve tried this product, and I am really happy with it. It has a light weight (about the consistency of regular hair conditioner), and doesn&#x27;t leave a waxy or oily residue in your hair. I also like the fact that this can be applied root to tip. I have tried several other leave-in conditioners that really can&#x27;t be applied to the roots without making your hair look oily or weighing it down in the front. This product doesn&#x27;t have a drastic effect on the weight of your hair. After blow drying, my hair has a very soft texture and no split ends or fly-aways are visible. My hair looks very healthy and bouncy even after using hot appliances. I will definitely purchase this again.</li>
            <li> works well on African American hair. i use this on my 4 girls it seems to help keep hair condition.</li>
            <li> Best leave in ever im 19 and i have relaxed hair, i wait longer then normal for perms , and i experience so much new growth and it is very hard for me to comb. I bought this product and the very first use i literally could feel my hair becoming soft instantly as i massaged it into my hair. AMAZING PRODUCT A MUST HAVE.</li>
            <li> This product in my opinion failed to live up to its expectations that it would nourish, smooth and softens while protecting against damage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now before going further into details I think it is important that you know my particular texture of hair. My family origin is that of Jamaican/Cuban and Indian so my particular hair texture is very wavy, and slightly dry for this time of the year but not heavily course or damaging. I do not have thick type hair but more of a medium-soft grade texture, and not a lot of frizz but do tend to have a lot of problems with hair detangle. I often do regular &#x60;leave-in&#x27; conditioning treatments about 2x&#x27;s a week; I prefer to stay away from a lot of hot ironing/curling to my hair or using Platinum base curlers which in my opinion will only damage the hair for short and long-term usage. I prefer to use a Titanium coated barrel and keep the setting no more than a medium type temperature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought Cantu Shea Butter (leave-in conditioning repair cream) after hearing these two females raving how much they love this product while shopping in the hair aisle at my local beauty supply store; as I have never tried Cantu products before I am always eager to try/learn new things. I was excited to try it and couldn&#x27;t wait for my next wash/conditioning session at home in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Scent&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say out of the various Cantu products I smelled in the store this company is consistent with having a nice, pleasant scent with their products. This product lives up to the Cantu reputation as this smells heavenly! It has a nice dewy scent and doesn&#x27;t have that heavy-perfume aroma; the smell is resemblance of the tropics with a hint of coconut. It is a bit greasy to the touch but doesn&#x27;t feel heavy or weighed down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cantu Shea Butter (the Product)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I used it I tried it with additional leave-in treatments/styling aids and the result were less than favorable. Instead my hair felt dry and limb; nor did the product absorb quickly. I had to keep re-apply more product just to have that softness I was hoping to achieve. I was so unhappy with how my hair felt that I re-washed it two-days later as I did not like the texture of my hair. The next time I tried Cantu Shea Butter about two-weeks later I did not add anything in conjunction with the product but once again it was a huge disappointment. Although, I left it &#x60;AS-IS&#x27; (as a leave-in conditioner) there were no bells and whistles to rave home about. It fell short to leave my hair feeling, \\&quot;smooth or soft and/or manageable\\&quot; as its claim.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product can be applied dry or to wet hair&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dry: Apply it dry as a daily styling regiment (with blow dry or curling/styling irons).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wet: As a Leave-In Treatment after regular shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also claims to help with Frizz Free Hair by applying it daily to split ends or damaged areas; \\&quot;simply comb through hair, and then allow for it to dry naturally on its own.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I suggest using instead&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using Motions Moisture Plus After Shampoo Conditioner for years and I cannot express enough how much I love this product. It leaves my hair feeling so super soft and my curls are as curly and defined as having Shirley Temple hair. It leaves my hair manageable and tangible to comb through wet or dry; this particular bottle is for Medium to Coarse type textured hair. It is great for after shampoo usage, color treated hair or after relaxed hair; it does not matter the outcome it has the same level of consistency each and every time. It cost only $4.49 and can be found at major hair supply stores; it is for at home care and has a great light feeling to the hair and scent without hidden dyes or harsh chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this as a rinse out conditioner as well as a leave-in treatment; Motions Moisture Plus product provides consistent results and is worth every cent; and for only a fraction of what one wouldpay for using Miss Jessie&#x27;s products. If you&#x27;re not looking to pay for the name but for a good quality product; this is the product to try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another product I highly recommend&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dr Miracle&#x27;s Healing Live in Treatment and Conditioner - This product doesn&#x27;t just condition ones hair but it helps to treat problematic hair and scalp problems. It has a strong menthol scent and you can actually feel it tingling throughout your hair but isn&#x27;t overbearing on the scalp. I recommend following up with this product after you use the Motions Moisture Plus; the two are safe to use together or by itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair treatment recommendation&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Apply any stand-alone regular hair conditioner with Dr Miracle&#x27;s Healing Live in Treatment and Conditioner; sit with a heating cap for about 15-20 minutes and then rinse. Repeat at least (2x&#x27;s a week); your hair will feel absolutely amazing! Your hair will feel Super-soft; having that truly conditioned feeling/healthy look and leave hair with a nice minty scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;** You can also add an egg for additional nutrients if you like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Review has been brought to you by &#x27;Awakened1&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;** See all my reviews:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A34AZ5B6CCBLPN/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_pr_auth_rev?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;sort_by&#x3D;MostRecentReview</li>
            <li> It smells good, but I&#x27;m not really sure if it&#x27;s helping to do what it says it will do. Despite the alcohol being in this product, it is not drying. I will continue to use after I&#x27;ve shampooed and conditioned my hair, but I&#x27;ll have to advise you to try it for yourself, and see if you like it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product over a year ago from a beauty supply store. I have a tendency to use up a product even if I&#x27;m not impressed with it.  This product did nothing for my hair. I&#x27;m 16 weeks post relaxer (going natural). This product is recommended in natural hair posts but this is a no CAN DO for my 4c hair. I will mix the remainder with essential oils to use it up.  I was sold on the shea butter title but I didn&#x27;t pay attention to the fine print</li>
            <li> This product is amazing, I use it everyday and after a 2 weeks I notices my hair was a lot more moisturized and also had less split ends then I had when I first used the product. My hair grew a lot more and was way more manageable then before, I have very curly hair, if i did my hair in the morning I would have tangles and knots by the afternoon, I recommend this product to everyone that want&#x27;s to keep there curls in check and the great thing is it cuts down time when I air dry, make sure you apply this product everywhere and make little curls with your finger.</li>
            <li> Super moisturizing!!!! use it to braid my hair under wigs and before getting regular boxbraids. i do get the best results when hair is slightly damp. on dry hair, too much WILL leave the white residue. Good for all hair types</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product for natural hair. This product keeps my hair soft all week long. You can also use this product to do a great twist out. I have used many popular products and none kept my hair soft and moisturized pass a couple of days. If your hair loves a lot of moisture than this product is for you.</li>
            <li> Nice leave in for natural hair not my favorite, but does the job of moisturizing my 3c hair. Would definitely recommend for transitioners, naturals, and anyone with thick, dry hair! Smells great too.</li>
            <li> Made hair soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> It feel sticky and quite too heavy on hair the smell is also strong. Thou some of my friends like the smell</li>
            <li> I use this all the time. Works best when your constantly doing wash and go&#x27;s. Ensure that hair is not soak and wet, but damp when you apply it. Other wise a white residue will be left on hair.</li>
            <li> Be aware that the picture and description are for the old formula, where shea butter is the 2nd ingredient. I received two containers of the NEW formula where shea butter is 7th and canola oil is 2nd. The new formula does not work as well for my hair.  It is stickier and does not help with detangling as well.</li>
            <li> For the longest time  i have been looking for a product that smells good and keeps my natural hair moist, and Cantu does the job. I don&#x27;t think it will work well on processed hair but if you are considering to do the big chop cantu is the product for you. I had tried the shea moisture smoothie but i did not get the same results. Cantu works well with olive oil and after a pre-wash.</li>
            <li> This product was great before the manufacturer changed the ingredients!! Shea Butter is not the second ingredient any more!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s now listed farther down the list.The consistency is less fluent and not as mosturizing. The scent is the same but thats about it.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t be fooled ,the formula was changed in early 2012. I happened to purchase the last of the old batch from my local BSS. The new formula didn&#x27;t work for me!</li>
            <li> Fast service...*thumbs up*</li>
            <li> It makes my hair softer and easier to comb . My hair no longer frizzes when I leave it to dry naturally, I&#x27;m  definitely going to buy it again.</li>
            <li> Lasts long, natural cream without residue. Protects, preserves, grows. No awful smells either</li>
            <li> This cream smells really good and it stops breakage and keeps hair shiny and hydrated. The price at Amazon is unbeatable!!! Will definitely buy again!</li>
            <li> I love this product, it smells so good and leaves my hair nice and soft.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing! Simply amazing! If you have dry or unmanageable hair this product it the product you want. I have been using it for 2 yrs. It is also a great scalp conditioner. It leaves my hair soft and shiny and more healthy. As an added bonus it smells good too! I have tried everything prior to this and will continue using.</li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s the bottom line:&lt;br /&gt;1) Hair is protein, it will naturally retain moisture.&lt;br /&gt;2) If the hair is damaged or altered, it will not retain moisture as easily.&lt;br /&gt;3) The consistency and ingredients in this all-natural (I&#x27;ve checked the ingredients AND the chemicals--remember, you&#x27;re made of chemicals, and you&#x27;re not so bad) will repair any hair type and add moisture in or out of the shower.&lt;br /&gt;4) BUY IT.</li>
            <li> My first and favorite natural hair product by far. It was what I used in my transition last year. And although I&#x27;ve become quite found of Shea Moisture, I will alway but Cantu leave-in from here 2 at a time.</li>
            <li> help keep your hair healthy</li>
            <li> Great &amp;#34;natural hair&amp;#34; product.  I bought this to use prior to swimming this summer and it worked well to protect my hair against dryness from chlorine.</li>
            <li> It works in the hot Georgia Summer heat to keep my hair moisturized and frizz free. It&#x27;s the difference between losing 75 percent in length to the heat versus looking like I have natural long curls which I do with Cantu.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair feel good, great smell like it.</li>
            <li> The first time I used this product, it didn&#x27;t saturate my hair like I need too. It left little white balls all over my head and if I used another product, it made it worse. Now this would happen everytime I would use this product!</li>
            <li> I received the product with the broken lid. Therefore, the contents was poured out of the container. That was very unpleasant.</li>
            <li> I love this product, however when I received it yesterday, the lid had come off of one of the jars, and both jars were covered with product.  Thankfully it was encased in a plastic bag, and I was able to collect most of the product.  As this not the only comment regarding \\&quot;lids\\&quot;, maybe you can consider shrink wrapping the lid to the jar, that way the lids won&#x27;t come off.  This has nothing to do with the product itself, but this is issue clearly needs to be addressed.</li>
            <li> Honestly, I&#x27;ve never tried a great conditioning cream like Cantu&#x27;s.. And this Seller is offering a catchy deal that I bought from him 2 times, 5 for each ( so 10 as for the deal).. But unfortunatly, the last time I got one which was damaged, it was opened and a lot of the product was spelled out :(.. I signed and take it..  But My request is to make sure of the carrier company that it delivers the packages in good condition...</li>
            <li> i have 4b/4c natural hair.works wonderfully to maintain moisture and reduce shrinkage. Great for use as a leave-in- conditioner and also just after a shampoo.Helps to reduce breakage on hair ends.&lt;br /&gt;Cons-causes build up and flakes when used with other products.&lt;br /&gt;Nevertheless its an excellent conditioner for natural hair.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this stuff!  It is my go to product.  No matter how many other products I try, I always come back to this one.  I&#x27;ve read many reviews that said they were left with flakes and residue.  I have never had that problem and I even mix it with other products.  A little goes a long way.  Good stuff. Try it.</li>
            <li> First, let me explain the product. It&#x27;s a creamy lotion conditioner. I thought it would be a bit like hair grease, but it&#x27;s not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now let me explain my hair: My hair is fuzzy, fluffy, brittle at the ends (horrible, I know), and in certain places - like the ends and edges - it&#x27;s dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, here&#x27;s what Cantu&#x27;s leave-in conditioner does for my hair: It goes on real smooth. And at first, you might want to just slather it on, and just let your hair absorb it. Because that&#x27;s what my hair did. First time I put it on my hair, it left my edges really smooth and soft and most importantly, flat. I no longer want to process my hair. I just want something to put in it to smooth it out some and moisturize it, which I think I&#x27;ve found in this. I really like this. In the few days I&#x27;ve had it, it&#x27;s been really good. The only reason I&#x27;m giving it a 4 star instead of 5, is because I&#x27;m not sure what the long-term condition of my hair will be in from using this. I&#x27;ll be sure to check back and adjust this review as deemed fit in a few months though. And if this proves to be extremely great, I&#x27;ll be buying more of Cantu&#x27;s products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT: Okay, I just have to add this... I bought this as my Christmas gift from my guy, and he even said that my hair looks a lot better. And the only things he pays attention to are his games and his guns. So, that&#x27;s saying something. And I have to add myself, that I&#x27;m noticing my hair is laying down more, it&#x27;s softer, and it&#x27;s way less fuzzy.</li>
            <li> The product was as expected. I used it before to maintain my curls and there was no difference with this lot.</li>
            <li> Love this product!!!!! Works wonders in my seven year old daughters curly hair!!! Makes the curls perfect and no frizz!!</li>
            <li> I have been deliberating buying this product. I was forced to buy it when I ran out of my regular leave-in. I used it as a moisturizer and sealed my hair with coconut oil and proceeded to braid my hair in two cornrows. When I took it down the next morning my hair was so soft and buttery and my curls were so defined.&lt;br /&gt;My one year old son usually cringe when I comb is hair. I applied a little bit of this on his damp hair and when I combed the comb when through effortlessly.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t plan on using this as a daily moisturizer but I am definitely keeping this as my leave-in when I do my weekly washes. I plan on using it my daughter&#x27;s hair.&lt;br /&gt;Yes, I would recommend to someone else. Great product. I am in love with the smell.</li>
            <li> This product smells awesome. I like using this as a deep conditioner with a heating cap. I am almost 3 months natural so my hair is short. I cant wait for my hair to grow so that I can try this for other  natural hairstyles. It smells good enough to eat. LOL</li>
            <li> I love this product. I am an African-american women who decided to stop putting chemical in her hair. This product is like enough to provide adequate moisture. Its also thick enough to allow me to add other essential oils to it. I had this product on auto delivery but the program was suspend. You can know only purchase it as an add on item. I won&#x27;t buy it as an add on because its cheaper for me to get it in a beauty supply store.</li>
            <li> First time ever using shea butter and conditioner definitely works treats and helps my hair very very well glad I got this Shea butter for a great price</li>
            <li> I use this product as a moisurizer and curl activator for myself and my grandson.  It makes our hair soft and manageable.  And it smells wonderful.  Plus, it lasts for a long time.  I will always buy it.</li>
            <li> My hair absolutely loves this product. Am relaxed and I use it to moisturize nightly and seal with Rose oil and wrap my hair with a silk scarf and let me tell you all I do in the a.m. is unwrap and style. Plus the scent is heavenly. even after a work out my hair smells great.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I use this condition almost every day.  Can&#x27;t wait to try other products in the Cantu line.</li>
            <li> I love this product! I&#x27;ve been natural for about a year now and wash days always made me miss my relaxed hair. After I deep conditioning my hair would be a little rough to handle ( I have 4c hair).  Now would this leave in condition by hair is moist and SOFT, plus much easier to manage. I always use the cantu cowash with this too and my hair is unbelievable soft! Next, Im going to purchase the hair masque. Its soo good to find products that good soo early on my journey which makes going natural easy!....... THIS IS A MUST BUY! PS.. I even used this when I was transitioning and it made the 2 textures very manageable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope you give this product a try!</li>
            <li> Ugh. I have never written a bad review, or hardly any reviews for that matter! But, I decided I needed to say something about this product. I left this product in my hair overnight and it left it too oily in the morning. I tried this product 3 other times and it left it looking the same no matter how much of the product I used.&lt;br /&gt;I am glad this stuff wasn&#x27;t that expensive, because after this attempt I just put both of the containers in the trash. I&#x27;m currently googling best leave in conditioners AGAIN.... Please do not buy this product. Keep looking around for something better. I don&#x27;t understand how this product has received 4.5 stars?</li>
            <li> I began using this product last winter as my leave-in and it worked wonders on my hair.  I usually use about a quarter size finger full on each section of freshly washed damp hair (after it has dried a bit under a t-shirt)and add either grapeseed or olive oil to seal it; braid/twist it over night to dry.  The next day I spritz it a bit with water then add a moisturizer then hair butter (once or twice I&#x27;ve used ECO styling gel on top of the butter/milk/styler) and have never had problems with flakes or had white balls of product build up in my hair by combining the products (although I have heard many others who have experienced this problem).  It has a very pleasant light scent that lingers but doesn&#x27;t bother me as I am not too sensitive to fragrances; it has a creamy somewhat thick consistency that melts into my hair as I apply it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had heard extremely negative reviews of this product but then realized that the reviews were written between 2008 - 2012 and the ingredients were totally different so I decided to give the product a try based on its current ingredient list:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Water, Canola Oil, Cetearyl Alcohol, Stearalkonium Chloride, Glycerin, Dicetyldimonium Chloride, Shea Butter, Aloe Vera Leaf Juice, Rosemary Leaf Extract, Nettle Extract, Sage Leaf Extract, Yarrow Extract, Fragrance, Olive Fruit Oil, Hydrolyzed Collagen, Dimethicone PEG-8 Meadowfoamate, Hydrolyzed Wheat Protein, Pentaerythrityl Tetracaprylate/Tetracaprate, Silk Amino Acids, Panthenol, DMDM Hydantoin, Dimethicone, Disodium EDTA, Polyquaternium-4, Polyquaternium-32 &amp; Mineral Oil &amp; PPG-1 Tricedeth-6, Hydrolyzed Wheat Protein PG-Propyl Silantriol, Hydrolyzed Glycosaminoglycans &amp; Sodium Hyaluronate, Propylene Glycol, Citric Acid, Sodium Chloride&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I looked up all of the ingredients and the ones that most troubled me initially were the proteins, Dimethicone &amp; Disodium EDTA but given that I don&#x27;t use this product as a daily moisturizer and they appear towards the end of the list, I felt reasonably secure using this product - thus far the proteins have never caused my hair to &#x27;freak out&#x27; as it has in the past when I used products with a high level of protein and I&#x27;ve had no trouble with build up since I wash my hair each week with either a shampoo bar or cleansing co-wash conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This has been a really good leave-in for me during the colder months and I&#x27;ve been fortunate to buy it from a few stores (both on the ground and online) for less than $5 per jar so as long as my hair responds positively to it or until I find something that works better, this product will stay on my winter &#x27;HG&#x27; list.ecure using this product - thus far the proteins have never caused my hair to &#x27;freak out&#x27; as it has in the past when I used products with a high level of protein and I&#x27;ve had no trouble with build up since I wash my hair each week with either a shampoo bar or cleansing co-wash conditioner.

            <li> I love this product on my natural hair. I use this after shampooing and or conditioning my hair, I add a little bit of this on each section before i use a wide tooth comb (to detangle my hair). A little bit of this, goes a long way because you only need a little bit. My jar lasts a long time, and I wash my hair usually once a week. It can be on natural or permed (relaxed) hair. I have used this on natural hair styles, but using it alone (will not provide a lot of moisture to your ends). This keeps my hair soft and easy to comb. This is one of my leave in conditioners. I have recommended this to others (natural or permed) because it is a great products (price wise and product wise).</li>
            <li> It seems to be okay.  I haven&#x27;t used it long enough yet. I will do another review later after a period of time.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best leave-in conditioners that I have ever used! I recently transitioned from relaxed to natural hair, and this shea butter produces the best twist-outs!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like this product at all :( I was excited about the price, but personally I learned the &amp;#34;you get what you pay for&amp;#34; lesson. My son is a toddler with 4a curls, and I myself am 3C. For both of us it had very little slip, which my son doesn&#x27;t appreciate nor do I. It&#x27;s very heavy and leaves our hair matted down after being slept on once.  Imagine my dismay when bath time (11AM) featuring beautiful curls, morphed into a brillo pad upon waking from his nap (3PM). And my hair doesn&#x27;t last one overnight. A simple spritz of water does nothing to bring life back to our hair, we have to entirely re-soak it and start over. Every.Day.For.Two.Weeks. After two weeks I gave up on Cantu for good.</li>
            <li> It smells incredible and does provide moisture, but does not soften my 4c hair. I put this in and still have difficulty combing my hair, leading to quite a bit of breakage. So I have stopped using this product.</li>
            <li> I bought his product because it came highly recommended from the woman in my natural hair group.&lt;br /&gt;My hair is coarse and my twist outs always come out dry and parched.&lt;br /&gt;Altho this product leaves a white residue on hair (which is why I dont recommend for wash and gos)&lt;br /&gt;It dries clear and when u unravel ur twists they are soooo soft and shiny.  I love it.</li>
            <li> I wear my hair natural so moisture is key. I use this every day, and have people coming up to me all the time asking how I keep my hair so moist. I love this Shea butter</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing to me &amp; my daughter&#x27;s hair. Never been able to detangle here hair nor than 2 inches thick at a time. With this I could comb handfuls.</li>
            <li> Loved it, has a great scent that lasts but is not too strong, and the product lasts a long time. Overall a great leave in for natural/transitioning hair.</li>
            <li> Worst leave in conditioner ever!!! This made my hair really dry I even tried to mix it with other products but it just make my hair more dry.  I will  not be buying this product ever again</li>
            <li> It just doesn&#x27;t do it for me and my 3b/3c hair. It makes iot unmanageable</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m AA with a 1.5yr of new growth. My hair is a mix of 4A/B/C-- that means dry, course, brillo-like super tight coils. My hair doesn&#x27;t take well to moisture with water based products, including plain &#x27;ole water. I am not one of those girls who can wash&#x27; fro&#x27; and go nor do my two strand twist/ blow out last more than a few hours, yes, even in the dry NYC fall/winter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used Cantu LICRC on dry, co-washed, AND freshly washed hair with the same results. Course, nappy, hard to manage hair. It makes dentangling and braiding more difficult (even on damp hair).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll stick to Miracle 7&#x27;s LIC mist or my homemade mix of shea and coco butters w coco oil. Even Garnier&#x27;s LIC, surprisingly, left my hair more malleable and moisturized than Cantu&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I use this product every day. I usually buy from walmart or target (if they have it in stock). This was such a good deal and I will not have to worry about hunting it down at the store. I have curly hair and find that with Cantu leave in conditioner my hair stays soft, moisturized, and smelling really good. It is a heavier product so Co-washing is a good way to keep down on flakes or build-up.</li>
            <li> excellent product, leaves hair so soft and rich.</li>
            <li> I love this leave in conditioner.  I have extremely curly hair and I use this and a curling jelly when I wash my hair.  I like this because, unlike other products, you don&#x27;t have to use a ton of it.  It doesn&#x27;t leave a white residue nor has it flaked either.</li>
            <li> I bought this conditioner on the reccommendation of three websites--which reccommended a good moisturizer for African American course hair (like mine).  A friend also reccommended it to me.  However, I was very disappointed bc it did not moisturize my hair--at all.  I highly reccommend She Moisture Leave in conditioner.  It moisturized my hair very well.</li>
            <li> Main ingredient used to be shea butter. It still works but you have to use it like 3 days in a row to get your hair to the texture you want. You cant mix it with anything else. Works on wet or dry hair.  I use it for twist out and before a blow out. Smells amazing.</li>
            <li> First, let me begin by saying, O.MGOSH! This little concoction brought my hair back to life.&lt;br /&gt;I always had hair that once relaxed, it was fine, I used to do it myself. It got longer and taxing to do, so I made the mistake of going to a salon to do it. Long story, short; it became sooo messed up, it was coming out in balls of yarn straw! I had BALD SPOTS! Anyway, I was advised NOT to do ANY chemical treatments in my hair for at LEAST 3-4 MORE WEEKS AFTER MY TOUCH-UP WAS DO!&lt;br /&gt;I tried alll sorts of things to replace, put and keep the moisture back into my hair. Until I visited a site and this product was mentioned. It has been since Nov 2013 since I had a touch-up and the outgrowth is smooth, hydrated, frizz-free, the relaxed hair is unscathed from the intense moisture punch this product gives.&lt;br /&gt;YOU WILL IMMEDIATELY FEEL THE DIFFERENCE IN ONE APPLICATION! Go on, be generous with use, it will soak it right up with no thick greasy residue. It has a pleasant light scent. I totally recommend this product to ALL! Whether you are a natural, transitioner or touch-up extender...THIS, is theee aabsosulte product for you! It will not disappoint for those who like a liquidy mixture.&lt;br /&gt; Even those of you who don&#x27;t, apply at night. It is GONE by MORN!It can be applied as a stay in after shampoo, used to style hair or daily use.&lt;br /&gt;I hope they change nothing about this recipe! GOOD LUCK !</li>
            <li> After years of looking for a product that can moisturise my curls I&#x27;ve finally found it. I have extremely dry caucasian hair. If I co wash and use this amazing stuff I can get even the ends of my highlighted hair to stay glossy and smooth for 2 days - even though I don&#x27;t use and heat at all. I&#x27;ve been using it for months now. It washes out easier leaving no build up. For 3rd day hair I spray my hair all over, apply a good amount while soaking wet, brush with a bore brush when half dry and finger coil into fresh curls. The results are amazing. I&#x27;m so pleased with it, it really is better than anything else I&#x27;ve ever tried &amp; I&#x27;ve wasted so much money on just about every other product on the market.</li>
            <li> This is a great leave in conditioner. leaves my hair very moist. you can never go wrong with shea butter and ever since i went natural this has helped keep my hair moist, healthy and has helped it grow too</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS PRODUCT. I have 4c natural hair &amp; it makes my hair manageable. But once i put this in my hair, I seal it with organic extra virgin coconut oil, &amp; hair is strong and soft &amp; smells nice.</li>
            <li> Fresh smelling, light souffle texture.  I didnt know I was getting two.  That was a bonus.  Works a treat as a leave in conditioner.</li>
            <li> I have been trying to embrace my naturally curly hair for a couple of months now. I am a product junkie who can&#x27;t resist trying the latest deep conditioners, oils, and shampoos for my curly hair. This conditioner is so inexpensive, yet it gets the job done! My curls came out conditioned and soft! I put this on after I apply my shampoo and put in some tea tree and olive oil to give my hair some extra moisture. I love this product and strongly recommend it. The jar is huge and will last me for months and maybe even years!</li>
            <li> I love the way this product smells.  It softens my natural hair and it only requires a little to go a long way.  I am an African American female and I wash my hair almost daily due to my daily exercise routine.  I&#x27;m wearing my hair naturally and this products conditions well.  I&#x27;m so glad I purchased this product and it will remain as my leave in conditioner from now on.  I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I could not beat the price for a double pack. This detangles and leaves hair soft and manageable. It works.</li>
            <li> My daughter turned me on to this product a year ago, and every since, I&#x27;ve been faithful to it. After washing my hair I take a good scoop out, and massage it in my hair. After covering it with a plastic bag for a good ten minutes then I blow dry my hair without rinsing it out. I keeps my hair long and healthy without feeling oily. By far the BEST conditioner that I&#x27;ve used in 40 years.</li>
            <li> It is really good to condition your hair. It makes it soft on the spot. The only downfall is the residue. It makes your hair really white, which makes you have to wait a while to walk out in the street. The smell is awesome, it lasts all day long. If you are bothered by strong scents then you might want to overlook this product.</li>
            <li> Absolutely the best...I mean the best!!!&lt;br /&gt;I love the texture. The best thing since tofu...lol... Normally I do two strain twist adding leave-in condition, leave my hair very soft.</li>
            <li> Excellent moisturizer. Not greasy. Light pleasant fragrance. It softens my transitioning hair and gives it great slip after cowashing. I use it as a daily moisturizer as well.</li>
            <li> Works OK. However, be prepared, your hair will be sticky all day long.... bring a comb with you will be a good decision</li>
            <li> This stuff is absolutely great!!  After reading the many reviews I thought I would give it a shot and it&#x27;s fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;Just what the doctor ordered.</li>
            <li> ...it leaves some kind of residue if you try to mix with another product. If it didn&#x27;t leave that filmy layer on my hair, I&#x27;d give it 5 stars. So sad. It smells SO good...</li>
            <li> really wanted to like this, but it leaves the worst residue in the hair</li>
            <li> Leave it in after a shower and sleep with your hair wrapped up in a towel and leave it in until your next shower(it&#x27;ll feel weird and crusty for the day but your hair will feel so soft when you wash it out), great for repairing bleached hair</li>
            <li> This conditioner doesn&#x27;t work very well as it is so greasy and very difficult to rinse out completely.  I suspect that this conditioner is for African Americans and wish that would have been clarified on the Amazon description as I wouldn&#x27;t have bought it then because I think my hair is the wrong texture for this product.  I could see it working well on African American hair, though.</li>
            <li> so far i have been using this product for a week and although my hair is not natural it still makes my hair incredibly soft especially after straightening it. the smell isnt too bad and is very subtle. overall i ,love this product and will keep using it!!!</li>
            <li> Great, good quality product and I love it. I will be ordering this again in the future.</li>
            <li> Sensational for very curly hair! Mellows it right out in a natural curl way!</li>
            <li> After loosing all of my hair it grew back extremely curly short tight curls&lt;br /&gt;this product is great holds the hair down so it does not look frizzy nice texture not stiff easy to use thru the day after using in AM wet and reshape on the go&lt;br /&gt;the price is reasonable and the amount (16oz/2pk) is generous&lt;br /&gt;smells fresh my hair is very soft and somewhat shiny&lt;br /&gt;hj</li>
            <li> I purchased this product about a two months ago becuase I was transitioning from permed hair to natural hair.  I notice that the permed hair from the top right side of my head broke off really bad.  I cannot say that this product is not great for natural hair, it just was not a great product for my transitional hair.</li>
            <li> I have long, thick wavy/curly hair that has become a lot drier over this last year or so, thanks to getting older, no doubt!  Never had an issue with dryness or frizz or breakage before, but now I do.  I&#x27;ve tried SO many products for help, wasted a lot of money, but this is really working.  It soothes the dryness, detangles and helps some with the frizz - not a miracle for that, but better than it&#x27;s been.  GREAT scent, too!  AND a very nice amount of product for the money, won&#x27;t run out quickly - very happy about that - that&#x27;s important to me given the amount of hair I have and the length! Recommended.</li>
            <li> I was excited to use this because of all the great reviews, I am turning into a product junky, trying to find the best product for my hair - low porousity, coarse, thick, I tried this and it had my hair feeling stiff, not good as a leave in or rinse out, I tried it on my daughters hair and its great for them, so at least I dont have to throw it out</li>
            <li> This product is great in black hair. It provides moisture without making my hair oily. It also allows me to leave my hair down as it enhances the natural waves in my hair. Love this product. Have recommended it to many friends.</li>
            <li> This leave in conditioner smells delicious, almost like a pina colada. It does a good job at keeping my dry poofy hair under control, but I find that it leaves my hair a bit dried out. Nothing too horrible, but I am still looking for that perfect leave-in and this is not it.</li>
            <li> Love everything about it.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t use conditioner bc it&#x27;s even less degradable than shampoo. Softeners are harder to be degraded than detergents in general.&lt;br /&gt;Most conditioners don&#x27;t really do anything for you anyway. They detangle hair in the shower, a temporary relief. No permanent improvement or hydration. I only use conditioner when my hair is in serious tangle, like after surfing.&lt;br /&gt;So, in daily showers, I skip conditioner and used to put on some oil or body lotion.&lt;br /&gt;Prabably I can do this bc my hair is pretty healthy. I don&#x27;t perm or dye.&lt;br /&gt;And I am asian. got lots of straight hair with volume, so as long as the oil is thick in consistency and I put it on sparingly, I come out okay.  Though, Oil is good for settling down my hair and probably prevents further damage but didn&#x27;t really moisturize or improve dry hair.&lt;br /&gt;So I looked through amazon to see if I could find something that could moisturize.&lt;br /&gt;Cantu had excellent pricing and good review, so I tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very very satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;It does moisturize. Even though my hair is pretty good, if it gets long, hitting mid back, it gets dry.&lt;br /&gt;Been using Cantu for several months now and I swear, my hair i s not dry at that length!&lt;br /&gt;Does far better job than conditioner or oil.  highly recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;But for girls with thin hair it might be too heavy. It will weigh down your hair.&lt;br /&gt;I like that about it bc my hair is full and gets frizzy when the weather is damp and shit.&lt;br /&gt;So if you want silky shiny light stuff, this is not it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The texture is very much like body lotion.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not greasy. It&#x27;s rather sticky when it&#x27;s on hair. Mayb I slather on too much.&lt;br /&gt;But I love to scoop and slather slather slather after shampooing on damp hair and go to sleep.&lt;br /&gt;Next day, my hair looks slept in and slightly waxy and I like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the big jar. Really easy to scoop the thing out in large amount.&lt;br /&gt;I bought some other shea butter based hairlotion with this and I&#x27;ve started to use it and I like that one too but the thing is it&#x27;s in a bottle and it&#x27;s super thick, I hold the bottle upside down shaking n tapping the bottom but still it won&#x27;t come out, I have to squeeze hard.&lt;br /&gt;Cantu, one more star for its ease of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went to Cannes Film festival last month, and I took big portion of this but was still anxious of running out.&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t leave without it.</li>
            <li> I am currently transitioning back to natural from being relaxed for years. This was the first leave in that I started using for my transition. The product is great for both my 3c/4a texture growing in and my relaxed hair. It is very moisturizing and smells great! It even helped mend some of the damage that was done from a few awful deep conditioners that left my hair dry and tangled.</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally curly and dry.  Coloring and flat iron make it worse.  Results within less than a week.  Hair is softer, shines and almost frizz free.</li>
            <li> I like the smell of this product. But this if used on dry hair will leave white residue behind. It is best used on wet or damp hair and with perhaps a little castor oil or oil of your choice to kind of blend it in more and make sure no white residue - which later looks like huge dandruff flakes - remain on you hair.</li>
            <li> I recommend this product to  all natural out there. Does not mix well with other products, tend to make it harder to detangle when mix with other products.</li>
            <li> Got this yesterday and used it right away.  My hair is overprocessed after years of color, highlighting, and curling.  It was no longer soft or shiny.  Even though it had been almost 2 years since I last processed my hair it was just not the same.  Being a person of Asian descent, my hair was no long shiny straight.  I tried shining products and smoothing products but nothing seemed to work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I washed my hair and applied the product.  I didn&#x27;t have a anything to cover my hair so used a reegular plastic bag and wrapped that in a towel.  Today my hair is amazing.  I can&#x27;t stop touching it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave the other bottle to my daughter.  Her hair is not processed but very long.  I can see this as being a great way of keep it untangled.</li>
            <li> I recently tried this product and I love it. I have natural 4b/4c hair and this product works great for me!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually write reviews but I feel I should put this out here especially for my fellow naturalistas. I am a natural, with the 4b/4c type of hair and I know how difficult it is to manage natural hair (especially the 4b/4c type). I decided to go natural last year because I saw a friend&#x27;s natural hair and I loved it. I did my big chop and was very excited..Unfortunately the products that worked for my friend did not work for me and I was stuck. I have (or rather had..thanks to cantu..hehehe) very coarse hair..it was always brittle, dull, dry and kinda stuck inside(was kind of growing inside). I hated this. I tried lots of products but they never worked..my hair was still the same; dry, brittle, dull and and very coarse. I read blogs on natural hair care and tips but I still could not get anything meaningful..It was difficult to get the right products for my afro. I considered texturizing the hair..I read about it and I was discouraged. I was on the verge of going back to perm when a friend told me to change my hair regimen..she said to do lots of deep conditioning (with egg yolk, honey, some conditioners, pure virgin olive oil, tea tree oil etc..) and use Cantu products. I was a bit skeptical since I had tried several products that didn&#x27;t work..but I decided to give this a try. So I came on Amazon to search for some cantu products. I got the cantu shea butter shampoo cream, the cantu shea butter leave in repair conditioning cream and the cantu shea butter grow strong treatment. Soon as my products arrived, I did a shampoo wash.. I couldn&#x27;t believe it.. the shampoo worked magic for my hair.. it freed the knots in my hair and I was able to comb as if I had conditioned it. I could actually feel my scalp breathing.. The grow strong and leave in repair creams made my hair really soft and manageable. I could comb my hair with no pain. (I know these two kind of leave residue.. but my trick is I rub a little olive oil in my palms and massage it through my hair and that takes care of it). The products kinda freed my hair..its now soft, has no knots, easy to comb or twist, looks and feels well moisturized and I can see the curls/coils are kinda defined now. The hair stretches too.. I can really see the length of my hair now and oh my gosh..I am so in love with it! I love my cantu products..now that I have FINALLY FOUND products that work for me(*whew*), I will religiously follow my daily hair regimen and I know in a month or two I am gonna be even more head over heels with my natural hair! Thanks Cantu...You guys rock!!!akes care of it). The products kinda freed my hair..its now soft, has no knots, easy to comb or twist, looks and feels well moisturized and I can see the curls/coils are kinda defined now. The hair stretches too..

            <li> A coworker suggested this product line to me and while searching, I discovered this and I decided to try it. I absolutely love the smell, it&#x27;s very nice. I use it as a leave-in treatment after I deep condition and it leaves my hair feeling soft in the morning (I have natural/relaxed transitioning hair). Plus there&#x27;s a lot in the jar when you get it so you get the most out of it. I didn&#x27;t buy this off Amazon and it&#x27;s a little bit higher here than in your local beauty store so if you can try to find it locally near you.^^</li>
            <li> Perfectly meet my expectation</li>
            <li> This is one of the best leave in conditioner one can use... Absolutely nice.  I love it, love it and I love it.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t praise this product enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using Cantu shea butter leave in conditioning cream since I was a teenager, feeling my way through the hair products aisle. While other products have come and gone since I was 16, the ONE thing I&#x27;ve kept in stock (when possible... at one point, Cantu leave-in was MIA), even now at 23, is this conditioner. Nothing has treated my hair better, absolutely nothing. Even with the ingredient change (I remember shea butter being #2 on the list), I still love this conditioner most.</li>
            <li> This products works well for my daughter&#x27;s 3b/3c hair (she&#x27;s almost 2 years old). Her hair is very fine, with tight coils and curls and tends to get very dry. The smell is pleasant and the consistency isn&#x27;t too thick - it&#x27;s thin enough where there are no flakes and there is no build up (at least not for us). I&#x27;ve tried several products and several combination of products to bring her curls to life (Curls, Shea Moisture, Knot Today, etc) . I&#x27;m giving this 4 stars because it&#x27;s not my &amp;#34;a-ha!&amp;#34; product but it&#x27;ll work for now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our morning routine consists of spraying her hair with a little water, then adding the Mixed Chicks leave in and a little bit of this leave in an combing through. Her curls are defined and moisturized. If she has a puff or a few pig tails, I seal her edges with the Cantu pomade. I&#x27;ve tried this routine without the Mixed Chicks Leave in and I&#x27;ve noticed that her hair isn&#x27;t as sleek and her curls aren&#x27;t as defined.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried the curling cream on her hair and it was too thick. The custard worked out well but since she&#x27;s at an age where she still rolls around on the floor and touches her hair a lot, the curls got crunchy and frizzy. I will try the custard again when she&#x27;s much older.</li>
            <li> Ive got 4c texturised hair, I love this product, very moisturizing and nourishing, leaves hair soft, best leave in I have used.</li>
            <li> This stuff is God Send!! I use this product as a leave it treatment and my 4a natural hair start breaking off, this stuff helps a whole lot. I would definately recomend it.</li>
            <li> Hello everyone, I am a transitioning african-american mixed, I love this product! I brought it for the first time yesterday and the results  are incredible, I have mid-back length hair. I applied to newly shampooed hair and did bantu knots. I slept in it overnight, in the morning my hair was so soft, bouncy and shiny. Its the perfect (one) moisturizer I probably will need for quite some time, I am hook!</li>
            <li> Purchased many times over. Does wonders on the scalp and hair.Hair feels very well conditioned and great shine to it. Reccommend it to others.</li>
            <li> I have been using this stuff for about 3 years now. I fell in love with it since the first time I tried it. I&#x27;m black and have worn my hair natural my whole life. When I was little my hair would stay short due to it being very breakable ans brittle. Mainly because my mom used to do it. Her method was to just gel it down and tie it up. Well eventually I started to do my own hair and experiment with different products and techniques. I tried olive oil products and many different greasy ethnic hair products. After endless trial and error I came across this wonderful, god-sent leave in conditioner. It literally changed my whole hair routine. Every day I wet and comb through my hair in the shower. When I hop out I take a couple scoops of the cantu and run it from root to tip. (focus mostly on the ends) Then that&#x27;s it! Nothing else. Don&#x27;t comb through it! Let it air dry. I promise you there will be no frizz and you get that subtle coconut smell ALL day. This is literally the only thing I ever use. I have tried other mostly organic products but I always find myself straying back to this one. And after 3 years of curly girl techniques and cantu, my hair has really grown. Its at the bottom of my bra strap when curly and it reaches mid-back whenever I flat iron it. If you stick with this leave in conditioner you will most definitely reap the benefits.</li>
            <li> Great product at great price</li>
            <li> I heard so many great things about this product but oh my goodness this product is garbage and that&#x27;s exactly where it went!  I was fooled for the first two weeks.  I LOVED this stuff as a leave-in but after two weeks I noticed that it was drying out my 3C hair.  I have now trimmed off damage and have gone back to my Jessicurl prodcuts!  If it ain&#x27;t broke don&#x27;t fix it I suppose.</li>
            <li> This is an awesome product for really curly hair. It leaves my curls smooth and shiny and smells great too.</li>
            <li> Great product, non greasy. African American with curly hair and it leaves my hair looking like I just walked out of the perfection salon.</li>
            <li> This is a really good product for bringing out the natural curl pattern in your hair!  I&#x27;ve used it for about a year now and swear by it!  The only draw back to it is if you apply it on wet hair it will dry a little white and flake (a little water as it starts to dry takes care of that) but that&#x27;s about it.  The scent is nice and your scalp will feel good with this product.</li>
            <li> I have long asian hair. i&#x27;ve bleached, dyed &amp; highlighted my hair for several years causing it to be straw dry! I&#x27;ve used other products such as olive oil shampoos/conditioners and nothing worked quite as well as this! I use it everytime i shampoo my hair and a little goes a long way! Keeps my hair soft &amp; straight. I no longer have painful tangles &amp; after a couple of months my hair is much longer.. quicker than usual. love it!!</li>
            <li> I have used this product several times since purchasing it and am pleased. I do have to heat it up by sitting under a hooded dryer as I have low porosity hair, but it works wonderfully and my hair feels nourished</li>
            <li> Excellent product for my locs.</li>
            <li> LOVE  IT  THANK  U  CARDINE  L.  JORDAN</li>
            <li> i read mixed reviews but decided to try it out anyway. i use it daily in my natural hair for more moisture and it works. i do not have any problems. its a great leave in for natural hair</li>
            <li> LOVE this product so much. I needed a leave in conditioner badly. I&#x27;m African American and have naturally dry hair so I did some research and found this product and decided to give a try...couldn&#x27;t beat the price. My hair feels wonderful after using this product. When I blew my hair out it was like butter. Would buy again and I already recommended it to my mom :)</li>
            <li> My hair is not chemically treated and I use this cream after I co-wash my hair before I dry it. It is awesome. I leaves my hair soft and manageable and it smells great. I also use apply the &amp;#34;grow strong&amp;#34; hair dress.</li>
            <li> this is my go to daily conditioner. my hair has grown to bra band length using it with extra virgin olive oil, spring water and gentle detangling.  it is the best for hair like mine (very fine, very soft, porous, tightly coiled hair).</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite leave in conditioners, using it leaves my hair soft and silky. It makes it very easy to tame and manage my curls, it is a part of my daily hair routine and I have seen such improvement and growth since I have been using this. I love that it is not too heavy but can be used in abundance to help set my curls.</li>
            <li> I live by the stuff!!!! I started using this product when I was transitioning from relaxed to natural hair about six years ago. Since then I&#x27;ve gone back to relaxed and it&#x27;s works wonderfully for both. I&#x27;m a product junkie and am constantly trying new products to find the best ones. This one is the best leave in conditioner that I&#x27;ve ever used. And an added bonus, it&#x27;s cheap!!! I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;d do if they ever discontinued this product.</li>
            <li> This product definitely increases definition for twist outs.  The price is unbeatable, it smells good, and the results are pretty good.  I have 4c (Afro textured) hair.  I apply the product liberally to damp hair, detangle from tips to root, seal with coconut oil, and flat twist.  I am satisfied and will continue to purchase.</li>
            <li> I liked the product! It is exactly as described.</li>
            <li> Thickens and softens hair overnight! Not even kidding. Love this stuff!!!</li>
            <li> i have natural hair and when i used this product it made my hair feel coarse after a blow dried it, i have not used it again since</li>
            <li> It is one of the best products for my hair, I will recommend it to anyone who has natural hair!</li>
            <li> I have been natural for almost two years and i just discovered this product.  Look no further this is what your hair needs!!  I have zero skills when it comes to maintaining my hair.  With this product, I have been asked by other can i help them with going natural.  I wash my hair and add the shea butter.  Instantly my curls appear and last all day!! LOVE IT</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a new curly girl and still not sure exactly which products work best in my hair, but I decided to try this product because so many people swear by it.  Well I am sold! My hair is always extremely dry in the summer months, and this product totally alleviates that problem. It leaves my hair soft and moisturized and manageable. I&#x27;ve only been using it for 2 weeks now, so I don&#x27;t know if it is actually &amp;#34;repairing&amp;#34; anything yet, but I would dfinitely recommend this product for those of you looking for a solution to dry dull hair.</li>
            <li> I have used this conditioner for a while and I love it. It works well when used regularly and sometimes I will even mix some in with raw shea butter. This is the only thing that I will use in mine and my children&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li> I love using the Cantu Leave In Conditioner. My hair a natural texture and I sometimes mix it with castor oil if my hair is extremely dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would give the company a 5 for how fast it was shipped, but the package arrive with some of the product leaking out of the container.</li>
            <li> I got this product at an amazing price and I love it!! I&#x27;ve been struggling with trying to get the right products for my hair and now I feel like I&#x27;m headed in the right direction . I use this in conjunction with Mizani moisturizing milk leave-in spray then I seal my hair with argan oil. My hair feels so soft and manageable now.</li>
            <li> What can I say about this? Its great...not sticky, gummy or heavy to the hair...unless you over saturate your hair which will lead to product build up.  It smells great and it keeps my kinky coils hydrated and soft.</li>
            <li> Bought this product from my local pharmacy for my incredibly damaged 4a/4b hair. My hair was breaking and felt incredibly dry all of the time. I first used this product as a deep conditioner along with some additional oils. I rinsed that out and my hair felt stronger and softer almost immediately. It finally didn&#x27;t feel like a dead mass on my head anymore! I coated a relatively generous amount on my hair as I combed through to prepare for finger coils. It gave great slip for combing and my hair wasn&#x27;t breaking at all! I then finger coiled my hair with Au Naturale Curl Defining Creme Glaze which also did a pretty fantastic job adding moisture and afterwards my hair was shiny and soft. I then blow dried my hair (using the cold setting) to help everything set. It came out soft and shiny and beautiful. A week later I put a small amount of the Shea Butter in my hair again to help maintain moisture and it feels just as soft and silky as it did the first day again. I don&#x27;t have any build up from this product, BUT my hair is incredibly damaged and dry so it needs moisture desperately.</li>
            <li> Adds more sture but leaves white film if hair is too wet</li>
            <li> Excellent i will buy it again</li>
            <li> I have 4C hair. This does not work for me. It left my hair dry and brittle ALL THE TIME!!!!</li>
            <li> I can honestly say this leave-in conditioner does what it claims. My hair is smoother, managable, thicker, longer and healthier.</li>
            <li> Anyone who wants a good conditioner thats not greasy and smells great, Look no further you have found it. Works great on 3b,3c hair it defines your curls and hair is soft all day plus you get two jars I say go for it.</li>
            <li> I decided to try it because I had pretty decent results with Shea butter from my local African shop I bought for my skin. Sadly, I did not get the moisturizing results others have reported. It just didn&#x27;t penetrate my hair, whether wet or dry. It would be like I never put it on to begin with, except for the pleasant scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t say it was a waste of money at $6, but it just didn&#x27;t work for my hair(4A relaxed). I&#x27;ve had much better results with Elasta QP Olive oil &amp; Mango Butter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not giving it my stamp of approval; I would say try it for yourself, to see if it works for your hair. It&#x27;s at least worth a shot at under $10.</li>
            <li> Great for thick and curly hair. It tames all the frizzes and leaves your hair soft and smooth. Great conditioner</li>
            <li> My hair loves it and therefore I love it. Finally found something that keeps my strands moist. My hair is always protected in twists so it&#x27;s perfect for that.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I have used this for 2 years and I have no complaints.  It is very moisturizing and provides good slip, especially natural African American hair.  I do recommend it.</li>
            <li> This did nothing for my natural hair. Felt like a &amp;#34;coating&amp;#34; instead of a conditioner! Not impressed by this prod</li>
            <li> I had never seen this product before. It is sold only in the African American have product selection. My hair is so dry and unmanageable I happened to look there. It definitely paid off. After just the first application I noticed a difference. And after a month my hair is no longer dry, breaking off and is growing again due to not breaking off. By far the BEST hair product I&#x27;ve used. Even after using salon leave in conditioners and products, this bests it hands down.</li>
            <li> I have type 2b curly hair and I find that the Cantu Shea Butter Leave in Cream is too heavy for my hair type.  I feel like I have something that I need to wash out when I put it on after showering.  Perhaps if my hair type were more curly, it would work.  I&#x27;m a product junky as far as trying to find the &amp;#34;perfect&amp;#34; conditioner, so I tried this.  That&#x27;s okay, no big deal.  I&#x27;ve been using it as a wash out conditioner so I wouldn&#x27;t waste it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love amazon shopping and ease of buying as well as offers through Prime Membership!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on the fence about this product. my hair feels really soft when i put it in but it leaves a white residue and my hair gets hard and stiff within a few hours. I add some argan oil after the product has air dried and this eliminates most of the flakes even though it&#x27;s annoying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the labeling provided to many retailers seems to be off; i&#x27;m not sure if Amazon is included. CHECK YOUR INGREDIENTS WHEN THE BOTTLE ARRIVES. It seems Cantu has pulled the switcheroo. Some containers of the \\&quot;Leave in Conditioner\\&quot; omit \\&quot;made with pure shea\\&quot; butter and those have shea butter as the #2 ingredient. the containers that have \\&quot;made with pure  shea buter\\&quot; have it as the #6 ingredient which means less shea butter.  the ones that say \\&quot;shea soft\\&quot; instead of \\&quot;shea butter\\&quot; up top seem to have the same ingredients as the containers which omit \\&quot;made with pure shea butter.\\&quot; One contains a higher concentration and many websites have that image and ingredient list even though they are shipping the one with a lower concentration of shea butter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005IUGRBI/ref&#x3D;s9_psimh_gw_p194_d0_i3?pf_rd_m&#x3D;ATVPDKIKX0DER&amp;pf_rd_s&#x3D;center-2&amp;pf_rd_r&#x3D;1D6ZZZ41Q78GYDMRJS1Z&amp;pf_rd_t&#x3D;101&amp;pf_rd_p&#x3D;1389517282&amp;pf_rd_i&#x3D;507846&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[...] (what I bought at walmart had a different ingredient list than this)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[...]%20Pics/DSCN1205.jpg  (notice difference in labeling)</li>
            <li> Great value for the price.  I have natural hair and need a lot of moisturizer.  Keeps hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> This is a great cheap leave in for my 4B hair. You can also just use as a base, and add your personal favorite products to it.</li>
            <li> I use this on my daughter&#x27;s hair to add moisture.  The only style that it works well with is when I do two-strand twist on her hair.  It comes out beautiful.  Other than that it makes her hair hard, if I put it on and then blow dry afterwards.</li>
