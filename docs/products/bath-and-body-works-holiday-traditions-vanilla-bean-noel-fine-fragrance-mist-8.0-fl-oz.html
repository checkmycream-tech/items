            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>Bought as a gift for one of my girls that LOVE&#x27;S this</li>
            <li>but I had to have it as I got some of the body gel for Christmas and wanted more.</li>
            <li>Love the Vanilla Bean spray, would have given 5 stars but it took forever to ship</li>
            <li>My Favorite scent from Bath and Body Works.  </li>
            <li>So glad to see it on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I was excited to find this on Amazon, without any laughing employees!&lt;br /&gt;Comparing</li>
            <li>Sweet vanilla.  </li>
            <li>This is quite possibly the most tantalizing, yummy B&amp;BW scent yet!  </li>
            <li>So fresh and delectable..</li>
            <li>This will be my first time trying</li>
            <li>I called a week after Christmas to see if my local Bath and Body Works had any left in stock, and they LAUGHED at me, saying all the product was sold out by the day after Christmas.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t last very long nor smell as good as lotion</li>
            <li>really obnoxious odor.  </li>
            <li>After calling B&amp;BW as so fourth, I was overly excited to find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li>May sound strange, but shipping was extremely fast.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li>it to what was left of my mini version, this is legitimate as far as my nose can tell.</li>

            <li> they gaveme the hardest time and wanted to give 3.80 for an empty bottle.</li>
            <li> A little expensive</li>
            <li> like artificial something or other.  </li>
            <li> Emails were very RUDE</li>
            <li> On the expensive side</li>
            <li> Just awful.  </li>

            <li> ordrered 2 bottles and one leaked and they gaveme the hardest time and wanted to give 3.80 for an empty bottle. Emails were very RUDE</li>
            <li> Loved it!  It has been one of my favorites for many years!</li>
            <li> LOVE THE SMELL!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> This will be my first time trying B&amp;BW Noel from Amazon.  I was given a bottle for X-mas and I was down to my last spray. After calling B&amp;BW as so fourth, I was overly excited to find it on Amazon. This product is amazing for any season...........  I hope once my order arrives, I&#x27;ll continue to feel the same.</li>
            <li> Smells so great- my granddaughter loved it! Service great too!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected. Received in the mail very quickly!</li>
            <li> Love this, it smells awesome!</li>
            <li> My daughters favorite scent!  Sweet vanilla.  Great for anytime day or night.  Love it</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe this was a seasonal scent! It&#x27;s one of the simplest, best vanilla fragrances I&#x27;ve ever had the pleasure of smelling. I called a week after Christmas to see if my local Bath and Body Works had any left in stock, and they LAUGHED at me, saying all the product was sold out by the day after Christmas. I was excited to find this on Amazon, without any laughing employees!&lt;br /&gt;Comparing it to what was left of my mini version, this is legitimate as far as my nose can tell. The sugar and vanilla notes last hours and hours, heating up when I&#x27;m active throughout the day.</li>
            <li> Bought as a gift for one of my girls that LOVE&#x27;S this so I get it for her every year</li>
            <li> This smells so good. On the expensive side but I had to have it as I got some of the body gel for Christmas and wanted more.</li>
            <li> Love the Vanilla Bean spray, would have given 5 stars but it took forever to ship</li>
            <li> This is quite possibly the most tantalizing, yummy B&amp;BW scent yet!  So fresh and delectable.. Christmas, winter and home warmth all in one bottle!</li>
            <li> My Favorite scent from Bath and Body Works.  Bath and Body Works only sells it at Christmas time. So glad to see it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> One of the greatest pieces by Bath and Body Works. May sound strange, but shipping was extremely fast. We received the package 5 days earlier than the expected arrival date; no exaggeration!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t last very long nor smell as good as lotion</li>
            <li> A little expensive but it smells wonderful.</li>
            <li> odor is obviously a personal matter....I thought this stuff stank...like artificial something or other.  Just awful.  I need to find someone to give it away to before I forget and spray it again.  or simply toss it in the trash.  really obnoxious odor.  NOT vanilla at all...</li>
            <li> this smells amazing üòç</li>
