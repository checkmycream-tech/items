            <li>Nice product.</li>
            <li>Nice assortment of tools though.</li>
            <li>I was offered the opportunity to review this kit in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.</li>
            <li>So far these have worked great!</li>
            <li>I guess they are mo9re suitable for people who have&lt;br /&gt;constant blemishes.</li>
            <li>How do you pick the appropriate size?  </li>
            <li>better than the ones i bought at the store..</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s still top notch.</li>
            <li>Just make sure you research how to use it</li>
            <li>She said she got it just in time because she had a stubborn pimple on her lip that she couldn&#x27;t get out, but was able to remove it with these tools.</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t know theres so many tool options to choose from</li>
            <li>Perhaps they&#x27;re better used on more surface breakouts (vs blackheads).</li>
            <li>but i&#x27;m glad I found one now.</li>
            <li>I purchased one for my daughters and they love it.  </li>
            <li>I love everything about this kit.</li>
            <li>She finds using these more effective and more gentle on her skin than using her fingers.</li>
            <li>The tools are sturdy and not flimsy or cheap looking which are enclosed in an attractive, professional looking case.</li>
            <li>These tools allow a much cleaner and more effective method to remove pimples and blackheads that removes the problem but doesn&#x27;t leave a mark or blemish afterwards.</li>
            <li>The zipper works fine, no kinks.</li>
            <li>Very high quality, nice case.</li>
            <li>I can see a huge difference already.</li>
            <li>Great for the big ones</li>
            <li>It has a tool for every type of blemish which is fabulous.</li>
            <li>The tools are said to be very useful and work as intended.</li>
            <li>Comes with cool case, product feels great, I just need to find out how to properly use them.</li>
            <li>works pretty well for me, I wish it came with better instructions.</li>
            <li>so I was excited to try out this set.</li>
            <li>The included instructions work just fine, but its nice to see it in action.</li>
            <li>best product ever, i have very small pores that come around my nose, but this product makes it easy to remove</li>
            <li>/&gt;There are clear instructions included, in case you aren&#x27;t sure how to use one of the removers, or if you want tips on removing blemishes easily.</li>
            <li>The tools are all stainless steel, easy to clean with rubbing alcohol.</li>
            <li>Quick delivery.</li>
            <li>I got my kit in a stylish pearl white case, and it is more petite than it appears in the stock</li>
            <li>The tools themselves are stainless, so easy to clean and sanitize.  </li>
            <li>It comes in a nice zipped pouch so you will never loose any of the items</li>
            <li>This product is made with good quality ingredients, and the case actually looked pretty refined and also presentable.</li>
            <li>In using it, it removed a couple of my whiteheads, but I did  this product is made with good quality ingredients, and the case actually looked pretty refined and also presentable.</li>
            <li>The blackhead removers that I buy at the store tend to get lost, as they are only sold in packs of 1, and are not in a nice case.</li>
            <li>It would be nice if the burr hole was a bit larger.</li>
            <li>They also get blackheads in their outer ears and behind their ears which these work great for!  </li>
            <li>Of course don&#x27;t stick anything into the ear canal, but for the outer ear and behind, where I can never reach with my fingers, these work perfect.  </li>
            <li>Tools are made high quality and feel as if they would not break easily.</li>
            <li>they seem very durable!</li>
            <li>My entire life up until now I have popped pimples the &amp;#34;old fashioned&amp;#34; way using fingernails which although was generally successful, was gross and often times did more damage to the skin than necessary.</li>
            <li>Good kit, for those precise tough to reach blemishes</li>
            <li>You can be clean, sterile and professional at home and not end up damaging your skin trying to use your fingers.</li>
            <li>No compensation for a positive review was provided.</li>
            <li>and I never guarantee a positive review.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s pretty much</li>
            <li>Makes facial care really easy.</li>
            <li>The inner holders are sturdy and do not seem to easily come off.</li>
            <li>works really well on blackheads.</li>
            <li>I actually really like these.</li>
            <li>The circular tool really got in there and pulled out the blackheads.</li>
            <li>, they didn&#x27;t do much else.</li>
            <li>Either way, the product in itself appears to be very well-made.</li>
            <li>All of the tools are made of solid Stainless Steel and the wide variety of options in the package is great for different kinds of blemishes.</li>
            <li>I love that it is in a case, that it has multiple sizes and different types of tools.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just a normal person</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found that the white head end is easy to use with the blemishes that are ready to come out, and the black head end is helpful with the not so ready ones!</li>
            <li>I use the cup and small loop tool the most often.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s very decent on the smaller ones if you catch my drift</li>
            <li>Overall I am pleased with the product but my only concern is the spoon shaped tool with the tiny hole is too small to fit over and then see the blemishes.</li>
            <li>Overall I think it will help keep my skin clear.</li>
            <li>It was a little more complicated than I expected but ultimately glad with my purchase</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a crazy blemish picker and this is my favorite tool ever!</li>
            <li>The product itself was this dirty, not easily broken, and did not look cheap.</li>

            <li> The product itself was this dirty, not easily broken, and did not look cheap.</li>
            <li> I paid about half as much for one single tool from the drug store</li>
            <li> For about the same cost of a single one at a store you can get an entire set.  </li>
            <li> The other extractors have all different sized loops.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this set!</li>
            <li> so large ANY of those loops could fit!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Video or links or something at least for how to use</li>
            <li> I do like the product, however, i was extremly disappointed when i didnt get better instructions on how to use the tools on my skin!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a single pore</li>
            <li> The case is white leather, wish it was black</li>
            <li> It is not too big and small enough that you can carry it in your purse if you want.</li>
            <li> No real instructions.  </li>
            <li> sturdy, zipper close, and red felt lining with elastic bands to hold the tools firmly in place.  </li>
            <li> With this kit, you get six tools and a case which makes it much harder to lose.  </li>
            <li> I wish I would have found this kit or at least something similar a long time ago</li>
            <li> One of the extractors even has a lancet on one end and a spoon extractor on the other, which I have never seen on the ones that you can buy in stores.</li>
            <li> Other than the tool(s)leaving a slight imprint on my face</li>
            <li> The one thing I would change would be to have a sharper tool so that way there&#x27;s less damage to your skin.</li>
            <li> they were vaguely typed out and was not clear enough for me</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s going to take a little while to figure out how to use it correctly.  </li>
            <li> I will be using the set every few days just</li>
            <li> A waste of time and money</li>
            <li> would have gotten this at least 4 stars, probably 5 if I could figure out what to do besides stare at them.</li>
            <li> There isn&#x27;t one negative thing I can say about this kit.</li>
            <li> This set would be very hard to lose.</li>
            <li> I have blackheads on my nose really bad</li>
            <li> Did not work for me. :(</li>

            <li> I love this set! The blackhead removers that I buy at the store tend to get lost, as they are only sold in packs of 1, and are not in a nice case. This set would be very hard to lose. It zips compactly so that it can be stored in a medicine cabinet, or even in the average-sized purse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are clear instructions included, in case you aren&#x27;t sure how to use one of the removers, or if you want tips on removing blemishes easily. One of the extractors even has a lancet on one end and a spoon extractor on the other, which I have never seen on the ones that you can buy in stores. There is an angled extractor for hard-to-reach areas. The other extractors have all different sized loops.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this set!</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my teenage daughter, as she is having acne breakouts. She finds using these more effective and more gentle on her skin than using her fingers.</li>
            <li> works pretty well for me, I wish it came with better instructions. works really well on blackheads.</li>

            <li> No complaints! My wife loves to pick at my face and squeeze and poke every zit, blackhead, and blemish. So far these have worked great!</li>
            <li> Works great, perfect for the picker in your life. Different sizes for different jobs</li>
            <li> Works great if you follow instructions. It was a little more complicated than I expected but ultimately glad with my purchase</li>
            <li> It comes with all the tools you will ever need for blackheads. And it works!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure the product is wonderful, but the instructions on how to use them is so lacking it&#x27;s pretty much worthless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It says to use the loops for blackheads for example.  But what loops?  How do you pick the appropriate size?  I don&#x27;t have a single pore so large ANY of those loops could fit!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Video or links or something at least for how to use would have gotten this at least 4 stars, probably 5 if I could figure out what to do besides stare at them.</li>
            <li> Great for the big ones and it&#x27;s very decent on the smaller ones if you catch my drift 4 stars I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> great set! better than the ones i bought at the store.. they seem very durable!</li>
            <li> Did not work for me. :(</li>
            <li> Excellent quality, I haven&#x27;t used them but these are a nice quality. The case is white leather, wish it was black but it&#x27;s still top notch.</li>
            <li> Well made. Nice product. Sturdy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was NOT paid to do this review or discounted anything. I&#x27;m just a normal person and this was a legit product.</li>
            <li> Great set. Comes just as advertised in a zip-up pouch. Tools are made high quality and feel as if they would not break easily.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve canceled this product after reading how if done improperly it could damage your skin.  Would recommend reading all instructions.  I may give it another shot in the future.</li>
            <li> Overall I am pleased with the product but my only concern is the spoon shaped tool with the tiny hole is too small to fit over and then see the blemishes. It would be nice if the burr hole was a bit larger. The tools are sturdy and not flimsy or cheap looking which are enclosed in an attractive, professional looking case. I am very satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> Lots of tools when one good one would have sufficed.  No real instructions.  I guess they are mo9re suitable for people who have&lt;br /&gt;constant blemishes.</li>
            <li> I have blackheads on my nose really bad so I was excited to try out this set. I used it within minutes of it being delivered! It has a tool for every type of blemish which is fabulous. The circular tool really got in there and pulled out the blackheads. I can see a huge difference already. I will be using the set every few days just so I don;t overdo it!</li>
            <li> Quick delivery. Product works well.</li>
            <li> Comes with cool case, product feels great, I just need to find out how to properly use them.</li>
            <li> This is a great comodone removal kit. I use the cup and small loop tool the most often. I am still experimenting with the proper pressure needed, but even as a novice I have not done any damage to my face.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend watching Youtube videos of people using these tools to figure out how to use them properly. The included instructions work just fine, but its nice to see it in action. I got my kit in a stylish pearl white case, and it is more petite than it appears in the stock photo.&lt;br /&gt;This is a must for anyone who gets blackheads or acne. Just make sure you research how to use it properly!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recieved this product free/at a substantial discount for my opinions and review.</li>
            <li> I got this as a gift for my mom. She said she got it just in time because she had a stubborn pimple on her lip that she couldn&#x27;t get out, but was able to remove it with these tools. The reason that it gets 4 starts instead of 5 is because she said that there weren&#x27;t directions. I feel like all beauty products should come with instructions!</li>
            <li> What a great product. You can be clean, sterile and professional at home and not end up damaging your skin trying to use your fingers. All of the tools are made of solid Stainless Steel and the wide variety of options in the package is great for different kinds of blemishes. The carry container is not the greatest quality but the tools themselves are wonderful. I recommend.</li>
            <li> I got this product at a reduced price so I would leave a rating but my rating is based on the product not the price, great quality and really strong!</li>
            <li> This is a great product that will help you with your pimples and blackheads. It comes in a nice zipped pouch so you will never loose any of the items</li>
            <li> Great quality product! Comes in a good case as well!</li>
            <li> This is a great kit for blemishes. I purchased this kit as a gift and have heard great reviews. The tools are said to be very useful and work as intended.</li>
            <li> Good kit, for those precise tough to reach blemishes</li>
            <li> comes with a good set of instructions. works well! didn&#x27;t know theres so many tool options to choose from</li>
            <li> Received at discounted rate</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a crazy blemish picker and this is my favorite tool ever! I&#x27;ve found that the white head end is easy to use with the blemishes that are ready to come out, and the black head end is helpful with the not so ready ones! Honestly though don&#x27;t extract your pores to the point of pain!!! Give it time and love and know your skin!!</li>
            <li> Quite underwhelmed especially given all the review hype. I would return if I had not yet used a couple of the tools. Other than the tool(s)leaving a slight imprint on my face, they didn&#x27;t do much else. Perhaps they&#x27;re better used on more surface breakouts (vs blackheads). Bottom line: I&#x27;d rather have a blackhead invisible to all but me (in my magnification mirror), than a tool imprint noticeable to all.</li>
            <li> Definitely not surgical steel.  Has a kind of metallic smell and taste that makes me wonder if it&#x27;s good for my face.  Nice assortment of tools though.</li>
            <li> This product is made with good quality ingredients, and the case actually looked pretty refined and also presentable. The product itself was this dirty, not easily broken, and did not look cheap. In using it, it removed a couple of my whiteheads, but I did  this product is made with good quality ingredients, and the case actually looked pretty refined and also presentable. The product itself was this dirty, not easily broken, and did not look cheap. I did have to struggle a bit to remove a whitehead because I needed to press a lot. However maybe it&#x27;s just my type of skin that&#x27;s problematic. Either way, the product in itself appears to be very well-made.</li>
            <li> My entire life up until now I have popped pimples the &amp;#34;old fashioned&amp;#34; way using fingernails which although was generally successful, was gross and often times did more damage to the skin than necessary. I was offered the opportunity to review this kit in exchange for an honest and unbiased review. No compensation for a positive review was provided. All of my reviews are based 100% off of my experience with the product and I never guarantee a positive review.These tools allow a much cleaner and more effective method to remove pimples and blackheads that removes the problem but doesn&#x27;t leave a mark or blemish afterwards. I wish I would have found this kit or at least something similar a long time ago but i&#x27;m glad I found one now.</li>
            <li> This is the best thing ever.  I love that it is in a case, that it has multiple sizes and different types of tools.  I purchased one for my daughters and they love it.  I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for extractors.  For about the same cost of a single one at a store you can get an entire set.  The case they are in is perfect.  It is not too big and small enough that you can carry it in your purse if you want.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s going to take a little while to figure out how to use it correctly.  But I like the idea of not using fingers and damaging the skin.</li>
            <li> best product ever, i have very small pores that come around my nose, but this product makes it easy to remove</li>
            <li> I loved the packaging and products are of good quality. The inner holders are sturdy and do not seem to easily come off. The zipper works fine, no kinks.</li>
            <li> Very high quality, nice case. It works.</li>
            <li> I do like the product, however, i was extremly disappointed when i didnt get better instructions on how to use the tools on my skin! they were vaguely typed out and was not clear enough for me</li>
            <li> I love everything about this kit. I&#x27;ll start with the case: sturdy, zipper close, and red felt lining with elastic bands to hold the tools firmly in place.  It&#x27;s not at all flimsy.  The tools themselves are stainless, so easy to clean and sanitize.  There are two different grip styles either a matte square shape or a textured rounded shape.  You get various different tools, and it comes with an instructional guide book so you can choose the proper tool for the issue.  Between my husband and my teenage son, someone is always having a blackhead/whitehead/ingrown hair/pimple issue and I am the sort of person that can NOT look at a pimple on them and not pop it.  With this tool kit I can stop damaging my nails (and their skin) squeezing them out with my fingers.  They also get blackheads in their outer ears and behind their ears which these work great for!  Of course don&#x27;t stick anything into the ear canal, but for the outer ear and behind, where I can never reach with my fingers, these work perfect.  I paid about half as much for one single tool from the drug store and I lost it almost as soon as I bought it.  With this kit, you get six tools and a case which makes it much harder to lose.  There isn&#x27;t one negative thing I can say about this kit.</li>
            <li> A waste of time and money</li>
