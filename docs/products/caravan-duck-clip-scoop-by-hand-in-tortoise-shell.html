            <li>Its the best clip ever</li>
            <li>Awesome!!</li>
            <li>It was the best hair clip.</li>
            <li>Great clips!</li>
            <li>Great design!</li>
            <li>so I was happy to see it when I found it here.  </li>
            <li>This is a great hair clip.  </li>
            <li>happy with product&lt;br /&gt;good</li>
            <li>happy today</li>
            <li>Two of these clips fit nicely, one on either side of my twist up like 2 hands &amp; they keep it up ALL DAY, AMAZING!!!</li>
            <li>It looks great, love the color, is well made, is of a heavier grade of plastic...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be buying more!</li>
            <li>I love these!</li>
            <li>it can hold all my hair up and it looks nice.</li>
            <li>I was impressed, but I still didn&#x27;t think it could hold all my hair up in the back.</li>
            <li>I hadn&#x27;t been able to find them in the stores or online</li>
            <li>I love this clip.</li>
            <li>I could not be more pleased.</li>
            <li>So glad I was able to find them again.</li>
            <li>Was planning on getting more today</li>
            <li>quality is better than a lot of hairclips, as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The price is higher than what you&#x27;d pay at a drug store, but as I said,  it is of heavier plastic and looks good...</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know why these side clips have never caught on--they hold better and they&#x27;re more comfortable.</li>
            <li>Plus they make it easy to sleep if I leave them in.</li>
            <li>Came extremely quick and it works fabulous!  </li>
            <li>I prefer the design they had last year but still works great.</li>
            <li>It hold a lot of hair, and sits nicely on head - doesn&#x27;t stick out too much.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;ll fit under a hat, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>but now that I&#x27;ve been using it for awhile, I consider price to be worth it and will order more as spares.</li>
            <li>Made really good; nice and tight construction.  </li>
            <li>Years ago I had found some awesome clips at the stores that worked great to quickly put up my long thick curly and unruly hair.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s so good to finally have a hair clip that works!</li>
            <li>It is very sturdy and stays in my hair better than the rest of my clips.</li>
            <li>Although it is similar looking, this is NOT as good as the discontinued Scunci side hinge claw clip.</li>
            <li>Trustworthy seller and arrived quick.</li>
            <li>My new favorite.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s still where I first put it!</li>
            <li>This clip holds it gently in place without crushing it.</li>
            <li>Amazon were nice enough to upgrade to 2 days shipping</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been in search of the perfect hair clip for as long as I&#x27;ve had long hair (20+ years).</li>
            <li>Nice clip for long hair!  </li>
            <li>They arrived very quickly and they were in my hair by the end of the day and have thrown all my old ones out.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d have cut the whole mop off without it!</li>
            <li>This is exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>but it had a plastic hinge pin &amp; broke the first time I tried to adjust it.  </li>
            <li>The pictured clip was what I owned for many years until the spring finally broke.</li>
            <li>I was surprised that the teeth that fit against the the head are not curved...maybe it would work if you planned to wear it along the side of the head.</li>
            <li>I bought one of these under a different brand name, three years ago, and have been looking for more, ever since.</li>
            <li>This is exactly what I&#x27;ve been looking for, It holds my hair all day which is the first clip I have found that does.</li>
            <li>I thought these would be larger, but they are more of a medium than a large.  </li>
            <li>Big and strong, just what I needed.</li>
            <li>I really like the deep Tortoise Shell color and the strong quality of the material.  </li>
            <li>the kind that can bend a little without breaking.  </li>
            <li>so I returned and asked for a replacement because I really want them.  </li>
            <li>The person who received the gift appreciated them though.</li>
            <li>Gets stuck in your hair, doesn&#x27;t hold as much hair</li>
            <li>I often sleep in a chair by my mothers bed &amp; this one is comfortable enough that I don&#x27;t need to remove it then.  </li>
            <li>I have already purchased another one to have on hand or if my daughter wants to borrow one.</li>
            <li>When I ordered I thought the price a bit high</li>
            <li>but I needed new ones.  </li>
            <li>I tried this side hinge claw clip out when the Scunci clip I&#x27;d been using to secure a French twist finally broke.</li>
            <li>At first glance this looked tiny to me.</li>
            <li>I could&#x27;ve appreciated a slightly lower price, but in the end it was worth every cent that I paid.  </li>
            <li>My friends and even my young nieces are always borrowing these clips.</li>
            <li>However the items I received had a slightly different design and did not hold my hair in place very well.</li>
            <li>but its design with the  straight lower teeth which are slanted at an upward angle make it harder to fit tight against the curve of the head.</li>
            <li>This clip, though smaller than the discontinued clip I used previously, keeps my longish hair securely anchored up.  </li>
            <li>I like it though because I can put my hair up before I dry it while I get ready</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve spent so much money on all kinds of hair clips.</li>
            <li>I have long hair and work outside, normal clips don&#x27;t work under a stocking cap, these do!</li>
            <li>This clip holds my long thick hair easily &amp; comfortably.  </li>
            <li>Unlike other claw clips, this open on the side and it holds alot more tightly and does not hurt as other clips.</li>

            <li> You can end up with a mat of dry split ends at the back of your head with a lot of clips.</li>
            <li> This Caravan Duck Clip was larger than I expected</li>
            <li> I have long hair and pull it up in a twist.</li>
            <li> It holds my thick hair very well.  </li>
            <li> This clip let&#x27;s me twist in in a chignon or wrap it loosely in a loop and get it out of my way.  </li>
            <li> It holds my hair loosely which I like.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of curly hair and wet or dry this clip keeps it in place.</li>
            <li> AND it was much cheaper than the other clips I have purchased in the past few years.</li>
            <li> wow!, the spring in this thing is very firm!</li>
            <li> Everything as described, definitely holds your hair firmly and you don&#x27;t have to worry about it falling out.</li>
            <li> It takes a firm squeeze to open but once in place it stays in place.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just a pity they are not sold in the UK, but now I know where to get them.  </li>
            <li> This is a solid, heavy duty clip,  thick plastic, although it&#x27;s smaller than I expected.</li>
            <li> But for me, after wearing it and having to repeatedly adjust it during the day...it went into the closet as an \\&quot;in case all my other clips break</li>
            <li> I have spent a small fortune trying to find clips that will keep my heavy long hair up, it always takes 2 of them</li>
            <li> They&#x27;ve all been weak and crappy, wouldn&#x27;t hold my hair up for longer than 30 minutes without needing to be readjusted, even though they&#x27;ve all been much bigger in size than this, and I have to be careful not to drop them because they break so</li>
            <li> They are the Rosallini Woman Girls Black Plastic Hairpin Clam Hair Claw Clips.  </li>
            <li> They hold my hair to my head, so it slips less, and they don&#x27;t poke me or hang up on headrests.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe I&#x27;d paid 10 bucks for this little thing.</li>
            <li> but they are out of stock even though they are a little pricey.</li>
            <li> very thick and regular clips just don&#x27;t hold it because of the weight.  </li>
            <li> I had some a few years ago &amp; they lasted quite awhile</li>
            <li> The only reason I even gave it a try was because, since it opens on the side, it&#x27;s less uncomfortable if I lean my head against the couch or something.</li>
            <li> It holds my hair tightly and works like a hair clip!</li>
            <li> It has some teeth that were not on the previous one that I had ordered that I do not like!!&#x27;  </li>
            <li> I have a lot of hair, and it&#x27;s thick and heavy!</li>
            <li> have a hard time finding this product, so</li>
            <li> and it does not leave those weird marks that other clips will..</li>
            <li> Not a good thing</li>
            <li> but I was disappointed to find out that the replacement package has the same hair clips that I had just returned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair to my waist and this holds all of it at once.</li>
            <li> My Granddaughter has thin hair and we tried it in her hair and it held that too.  </li>
            <li> too bad it doesn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> This is a solid, heavy duty clip,  thick plastic, although it&#x27;s smaller than I expected. I wish it were wider</li>
            <li> I owned one of this clip so I was happy to see it when I found it here.  I immediately ordered 3 and when the package arrived, it was not the same type as shown on the picture.  I thought they made a mistake so I returned and asked for a replacement because I really want them.  Amazon were nice enough to upgrade to 2 days shipping but I was disappointed to find out that the replacement package has the same hair clips that I had just returned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a hard time finding this product, so I don&#x27;t mind paying for it.  Its the best clip ever and I don&#x27;t know why it has been discontinued. Unlike other claw clips, this open on the side and it holds alot more tightly and does not hurt as other clips. If anyone know where i could locate this product, Please let me know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its ashamed that Amazon still have this listed with this picture on.  In fact, i want to know where can I complain about this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been in search of the perfect hair clip for as long as I&#x27;ve had long hair (20+ years). I have a lot of hair, and it&#x27;s thick and heavy! I&#x27;ve spent so much money on all kinds of hair clips. They&#x27;ve all been weak and crappy, wouldn&#x27;t hold my hair up for longer than 30 minutes without needing to be readjusted, even though they&#x27;ve all been much bigger in size than this, and I have to be careful not to drop them because they break so easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The package arrived today. At first glance this looked tiny to me. I couldn&#x27;t believe I&#x27;d paid 10 bucks for this little thing. The only reason I even gave it a try was because, since it opens on the side, it&#x27;s less uncomfortable if I lean my head against the couch or something. So I opened it, and wow!, the spring in this thing is very firm! I was impressed, but I still didn&#x27;t think it could hold all my hair up in the back. I gathered my hair, put this thing in, and it didn&#x27;t budge! It&#x27;s been in my hair all day and it&#x27;s still where I first put it! Ahhhh . . . it&#x27;s so good to finally have a hair clip that works! I&#x27;ll be buying more!</li>
            <li> For those of us who have lots of hair, this is the clip you want.  My hair is very thick and regular clips just don&#x27;t hold it because of the weight.  This clip let&#x27;s me twist in in a chignon or wrap it loosely in a loop and get it out of my way.  I&#x27;d have cut the whole mop off without it!</li>
            <li> I did like this clip.  I ordered several and this is one of my favorites.  It holds my hair loosely which I like.</li>
            <li> I thought these would be larger, but they are more of a medium than a large.  The person who received the gift appreciated them though.</li>
            <li> Years ago I had found some awesome clips at the stores that worked great to quickly put up my long thick curly and unruly hair.  They held my hair and didn&#x27;t hurt.  I hadn&#x27;t been able to find them in the stores or online and so tried this one.  It&#x27;s not the same.  Gets stuck in your hair, doesn&#x27;t hold as much hair and they hurt.  I did find the ones I wanted also on Amazon.  They are the Rosallini Woman Girls Black Plastic Hairpin Clam Hair Claw Clips.  They are awesome!&lt;br /&gt;!</li>
            <li> Big and strong, just what I needed.</li>
            <li> I prefer the design they had last year but still works great. I have a lot of curly hair and wet or dry this clip keeps it in place. A big danger with clips and curly hair is the crush factor. You can end up with a mat of dry split ends at the back of your head with a lot of clips. This clip holds it gently in place without crushing it. My friends and even my young nieces are always borrowing these clips.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I was looking for. Not quite as big as I was expecting, about 3 inches at it&#x27;s longest -- but it can hold all my hair up and it looks nice.</li>
            <li> Nice clip for long hair!  It holds my hair tightly and works like a hair clip! I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> Awesome!! Came extremely quick and it works fabulous!  Everything as described, definitely holds your hair firmly and you don&#x27;t have to worry about it falling out.</li>
            <li> I have been searching for the side clips like this.  I had some a few years ago &amp; they lasted quite awhile but I needed new ones.  I bought a different one but it had a plastic hinge pin &amp; broke the first time I tried to adjust it.  This one has a metal hinge pin and holds all my hair all day without adjusting.  I often sleep in a chair by my mothers bed &amp; this one is comfortable enough that I don&#x27;t need to remove it then.  I also like that it&#x27;s not the brittle plastic but the kind that can bend a little without breaking.  I have already purchased another one to have on hand or if my daughter wants to borrow one.</li>
            <li> I really like the deep Tortoise Shell color and the strong quality of the material.  It takes a firm squeeze to open but once in place it stays in place.</li>
            <li> The clip I received was not the same as pictured on the web page. I exchanged it and again received a different style. The pictured clip was what I owned for many years until the spring finally broke. It was the best hair clip. However the items I received had a slightly different design and did not hold my hair in place very well.</li>
            <li> My new favorite. I love this clip. It hold a lot of hair, and sits nicely on head - doesn&#x27;t stick out too much.</li>
            <li> This Caravan Duck Clip was larger than I expected but I find that I have been reaching for it almost every day. It is very sturdy and stays in my hair better than the rest of my clips. I could not be more pleased. AND it was much cheaper than the other clips I have purchased in the past few years. I would definitely buy it again and may actually do so when it is back in stock!</li>
            <li> I have spent a small fortune trying to find clips that will keep my heavy long hair up, it always takes 2 of them but still I could not find ones to work until these clips. Two of these clips fit nicely, one on either side of my twist up like 2 hands &amp; they keep it up ALL DAY, AMAZING!!! So comfy, no sore spots that make you take them out. Great clips!</li>
            <li> This clip holds my long thick hair easily &amp; comfortably.  It&#x27;s not flimsily made.  After a month of using this clip almost daily, it shows no signs of weakness or wear.  I could&#x27;ve appreciated a slightly lower price, but in the end it was worth every cent that I paid.  If/when it gives out, I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to purchase this same item again.</li>
            <li> I tried this side hinge claw clip out when the Scunci clip I&#x27;d been using to secure a French twist finally broke. Scunci stopped producing this style but have told me that they plan to bring it back. Although it is similar looking, this is NOT as good as the discontinued Scunci side hinge claw clip. It looks great, love the color, is well made, is of a heavier grade of plastic...but its design with the  straight lower teeth which are slanted at an upward angle make it harder to fit tight against the curve of the head. Not a good thing if you wear your hair up and back. I was surprised that the teeth that fit against the the head are not curved...maybe it would work if you planned to wear it along the side of the head. But for me, after wearing it and having to repeatedly adjust it during the day...it went into the closet as an \\&quot;in case all my other clips break I&#x27;ll use it\\&quot; item! The Caravan Duck Clip Scoop...why call it that anyway?  The price is higher than what you&#x27;d pay at a drug store, but as I said,  it is of heavier plastic and looks good...too bad it doesn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> I love these! I have long hair and work outside, normal clips don&#x27;t work under a stocking cap, these do! Plus they make it easy to sleep if I leave them in. Great design! So glad I was able to find them again.</li>
            <li> This is a great hair clip.  It holds my thick hair very well.  My Granddaughter has thin hair and we tried it in her hair and it held that too.  Was planning on getting more today but they are out of stock even though they are a little pricey.</li>
            <li> I bought one of these under a different brand name, three years ago, and have been looking for more, ever since. I don&#x27;t know why these side clips have never caught on--they hold better and they&#x27;re more comfortable. They hold my hair to my head, so it slips less, and they don&#x27;t poke me or hang up on headrests. They&#x27;ll fit under a hat, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The quality is better than a lot of hairclips, as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Come on, Caravan, start making these again!</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I&#x27;ve been looking for, It holds my hair all day which is the first clip I have found that does. It&#x27;s just a pity they are not sold in the UK, but now I know where to get them.  They arrived very quickly and they were in my hair by the end of the day and have thrown all my old ones out.</li>
            <li> This is like one of the &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; claws. Made really good; nice and tight construction.  I have very thick hair to my waist and this holds all of it at once. When I ordered I thought the price a bit high but now that I&#x27;ve been using it for awhile, I consider price to be worth it and will order more as spares. Trustworthy seller and arrived quick.</li>
            <li> happy with product&lt;br /&gt;good to use, convenient package.&lt;br /&gt;very happy today and I hope in the future&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for a job</li>
            <li> No. It has some teeth that were not on the previous one that I had ordered that I do not like!!&#x27;  I have long hair and pull it up in a twist. This Duck clip pulls my hair and I actually can&#x27;t put it in my hair the correct way!!! I would have sent it back but I threw away the bag before I noticed the teeth.</li>
            <li> Well..it is a hair clip and it works.. I like it though because I can put my hair up before I dry it while I get ready and it does not leave those weird marks that other clips will..</li>
            <li> This clip, though smaller than the discontinued clip I used previously, keeps my longish hair securely anchored up.  It seems to be sturdily made.</li>
