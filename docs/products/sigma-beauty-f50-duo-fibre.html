            <li>It&#x27;s amazing</li>
            <li>Thank you for sending it in a timely manner and packing it so nicely for shipping.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It tends to create a lighter coverage than my f80, but it creates a nice finish.</li>
            <li>I had to get one of my own</li>
            <li>It blends out nicely.</li>
            <li>It gives you a flawless, soft, airbrush look!</li>
            <li>I love this brush more than my beauty blender!  </li>
            <li>I have been using it for awhile now, and the bristles are so soft and the foundation goes on flawlessly.</li>
            <li>So yes I recommend this brush if you want a cheap, good brush.</li>
            <li>Gives you the near flawless look.</li>
            <li>I DID SAY NEAR FLAWLESS...</li>
            <li>Makes foundation so easy to apply!</li>
            <li>Better than MAC</li>
            <li>great for fast foundation application</li>
            <li>Love this brush.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments on my skin since I started using the brush.</li>
            <li>really love this brush</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>Nice brush - blends smooth and doesn&#x27;t leave bristles all over like the cheap ones!</li>
            <li>I love this brush.</li>
            <li>This brush is fantastic!</li>
            <li>I really really love this brush.</li>
            <li>I really love this brush.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;m in love.</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how I lived without one for so many years.  </li>
            <li>I wanted to love this one, but I&#x27;ll stick with my Sigma kabuki which hasn&#x27;t given me any problems.</li>
            <li>so I gave it 4 stars because so far so good!</li>
            <li>I was so excited when I received my brushes in the mail today!</li>
            <li>Quality is great, arrived fast, true as pictured.</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t really make a comparison, but this brush is still really good.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Real Techniques Stippling brush for about a year now with good results, but I always thought the brush head is a bit skimpy &amp; the handle isn&#x27;t wel designed.</li>
            <li>The finish of makeup is really good, it seems more natural.</li>
            <li>They are at a very reasonable price for such great quality.!</li>
            <li>that is even and smooth.  </li>
            <li>the stippling effect of this brush is fantastic.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean and make sturdy.</li>
            <li>Love the product and worth every penny.</li>
            <li>I completely recommend this product to anyone looking for a good makeup brush.</li>
            <li>Hurry up and buy these brushes before they go main stream and end up costing way more!</li>
            <li>The Sigma gave me a beautiful, air-brushed finish And Didn&#x27;t Shed A Single Hair!</li>
            <li>I clean my brush every week with soap and water.</li>
            <li>But I give Real Techniques full marks because their Stippling brush works well, has held together for more than a year &amp; it never, ever sheds.</li>
            <li>I love this brush for applying my liquid foundation, it really does what it says it does and makes your makeup look airbrushed.</li>
            <li>I can apply full coverage foundation without looking cakey.</li>
            <li>Item was shipped quickly.</li>
            <li>I love it and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>My wife loves this Sigma brush very much!</li>
            <li>My new MAC brush sheds like a cheap fur coat every time I use it, even after repeated cleanings!</li>
            <li>I personally find it better than MAC&#x27;s 187!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll definitely be buying more of their brushes soon!</li>
            <li>Soft bristles, durable, picks up product fabulously!</li>
            <li>The brush is not even a month old and the top already came off.</li>
            <li>These brushes are worth every penny.</li>
            <li>love this due fiber brushe, its gives such a nice brush effect , i used it for the liquid foundation, and its so easy to clean though.</li>
            <li>I saved so much money buying these brushes and they seriously are the best!</li>
            <li>I generally tend to love Sigma brushes.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s nothing a quick touch of a flat top brush couldn&#x27;t fix</li>
            <li>I recently lost my MAC 187 brush but couldn&#x27;t get myself to pay another $42 for another one, so I brought this more economical brush instead for a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li>the product arrived earlier than expected, in great condition and true to its description... delivers an airbrushed finish upon application of foundation.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I did, because this brush is high quality and nearly identical to the MAC&#x27;s version.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I purchase a sigma brush.</li>
            <li>I am a pro MUA and I love this brush for creating sheer coverage looks.  </li>
            <li>The brush has a great thick handle, for ease of use.</li>
            <li>I am really satisfied with this brush &amp; will definitely be repurchasing.</li>
            <li>The bristles are rather short &amp; there could be more of them.</li>
            <li>I really like the brush!</li>
            <li>I love all Sigma brushed</li>
            <li>First of...</li>
            <li>This was the first stippling brush I ever owned</li>
            <li>This brush is definitely not a fake, upon opening</li>
            <li>I have trie pd that same foundation with other brushes and this one is by far the best.</li>
            <li>While, I don&#x27;t use it everyday, I can&#x27;t say much about the life before bristles start falling out, but so far so good!</li>
            <li>I washed it the first time and noticed shedding but thought it was normal the first time they are washed.</li>
            <li>I washed it the first time and noticed shedding/bleeding which seems to be normal for a lot of brushes the first time they are washed.</li>
            <li>Its super soft.</li>
            <li>While this left my face a very interesting shade of blue, it was not the effect I was hoping to achieve.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this brush if you use liquid foundation!</li>
            <li>The brush was better than expected.</li>
            <li>The shipping to France was fast (10 days)</li>
            <li>Blends my powder &amp; concealer very well.  </li>
            <li>It shipped to me fast</li>
            <li>Other than that I will look forward to using this product :)</li>
            <li>I had previously used a friends duo fibre-F50 brush and I absolutely fell in love with it.</li>
            <li>Wish the bristles were a little stiffer, but overall a good quality brush for the price.  </li>
            <li>I would HIGHLY reccomend the brushes to everyone.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this one!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>i guess i was expecting it to be a little better.</li>
            <li>Gives the skin a natural, airbrush finish in a matter of seconds!</li>
            <li>Why pay all that money at MAC when you can buy a cheaper brush from Sigma that performs exactly the same?</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say how long it will last for, but for the price it is definitely worth the investment!</li>
            <li>This set was recommended to me by a professional make-up artist in the DC area.  </li>
            <li>(I guess that&#x27;s because the bristles are a combo of natural &amp; synthetic hairs...?)</li>
            <li>surprised her with this gift and Sigma beauty</li>
            <li>surprised her with the additional gift that they sent to her</li>
            <li>You skin will look airbrushed if you stipple the foundation on and do soft circular motions to blend it in.</li>
            <li>No shedding so far, and the bristles are extremely soft.</li>
            <li>I noticed how soft the bristles were.</li>
            <li>It FAR exceeds the one I purchased from the Laura Mercier counter at a major department store.</li>
            <li>Worth every single penny!!!</li>
            <li>High quality and lasts long.</li>
            <li>I wash my brushes gently with mild brush cleaner and dry and store them correctly, so I&#x27;m not sure why this happened.</li>
            <li>Barely there finish</li>
            <li>They are exactly what I expected and I can&#x27;t wait to use them!!</li>
            <li>But I was able to live with the little black hairs left behind on my face as they were easily picked off.  </li>

            <li> The finish of makeup is really good, it seems more natural.</li>

            <li> that is even and smooth.  </li>
            <li> the stippling effect of this brush is fantastic.</li>

            <li> The Sigma gave me a beautiful, air-brushed finish And Didn&#x27;t Shed A Single Hair!</li>
            <li> I clean my brush every week with soap and water.</li>
            <li> But I give Real Techniques full marks because their Stippling brush works well, has held together for more than a year &amp; it never, ever sheds.</li>

            <li> My new MAC brush sheds like a cheap fur coat every time I use it, even after repeated cleanings!</li>
            <li> I personally find it better than MAC&#x27;s 187!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll definitely be buying more of their brushes soon!</li>
            <li> Soft bristles, durable, picks up product fabulously!</li>
            <li> The brush is not even a month old and the top already came off.</li>
            <li> These brushes are worth every penny.</li>
            <li> love this due fiber brushe, its gives such a nice brush effect , i used it for the liquid foundation, and its so easy to clean though.</li>
            <li> I saved so much money buying these brushes and they seriously are the best!</li>
            <li> I generally tend to love Sigma brushes.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s nothing a quick touch of a flat top brush couldn&#x27;t fix</li>
            <li> I recently lost my MAC 187 brush but couldn&#x27;t get myself to pay another $42 for another one, so I brought this more economical brush instead for a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li> the product arrived earlier than expected, in great condition and true to its description... delivers an airbrushed finish upon application of foundation.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I did, because this brush is high quality and nearly identical to the MAC&#x27;s version.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I purchase a sigma brush.</li>
            <li> I am a pro MUA and I love this brush for creating sheer coverage looks.  </li>
            <li> The brush has a great thick handle, for ease of use.</li>
            <li> I am really satisfied with this brush &amp; will definitely be repurchasing.</li>
            <li> The bristles are rather short &amp; there could be more of them.</li>
            <li> I really like the brush!</li>
            <li> I love all Sigma brushed</li>
            <li> First of...</li>
            <li> This was the first stippling brush I ever owned</li>
            <li> This brush is definitely not a fake, upon opening</li>
            <li> I have trie pd that same foundation with other brushes and this one is by far the best.</li>
            <li> While, I don&#x27;t use it everyday, I can&#x27;t say much about the life before bristles start falling out, but so far so good!</li>
            <li> I washed it the first time and noticed shedding but thought it was normal the first time they are washed.</li>
            <li> I washed it the first time and noticed shedding/bleeding which seems to be normal for a lot of brushes the first time they are washed.</li>
            <li> Its super soft.</li>
            <li> While this left my face a very interesting shade of blue, it was not the effect I was hoping to achieve.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this brush if you use liquid foundation!</li>
            <li> The brush was better than expected.</li>
            <li> The shipping to France was fast (10 days)</li>
            <li> Blends my powder &amp; concealer very well.  </li>
            <li> It shipped to me fast</li>
            <li> Other than that I will look forward to using this product :)</li>
            <li> I had previously used a friends duo fibre-F50 brush and I absolutely fell in love with it.</li>
            <li> Wish the bristles were a little stiffer, but overall a good quality brush for the price.  </li>
            <li> I would HIGHLY reccomend the brushes to everyone.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this one!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> i guess i was expecting it to be a little better.</li>
            <li> Gives the skin a natural, airbrush finish in a matter of seconds!</li>
            <li> Why pay all that money at MAC when you can buy a cheaper brush from Sigma that performs exactly the same?</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say how long it will last for, but for the price it is definitely worth the investment!</li>
            <li> This set was recommended to me by a professional make-up artist in the DC area.  </li>
            <li> (I guess that&#x27;s because the bristles are a combo of natural &amp; synthetic hairs...?)</li>
            <li> surprised her with this gift and Sigma beauty</li>
            <li> surprised her with the additional gift that they sent to her</li>
            <li> You skin will look airbrushed if you stipple the foundation on and do soft circular motions to blend it in.</li>
            <li> No shedding so far, and the bristles are extremely soft.</li>
            <li> I noticed how soft the bristles were.</li>
            <li> It FAR exceeds the one I purchased from the Laura Mercier counter at a major department store.</li>
            <li> Worth every single penny!!!</li>
            <li> High quality and lasts long.</li>
            <li> I wash my brushes gently with mild brush cleaner and dry and store them correctly, so I&#x27;m not sure why this happened.</li>
            <li> Barely there finish</li>
            <li> They are exactly what I expected and I can&#x27;t wait to use them!!</li>
            <li> But I was able to live with the little black hairs left behind on my face as they were easily picked off.  </li>
            <li> I bought it along with a few other Sigma brushes, and I am NOT sorry that I bought it!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use MAC cosmetics because they&#x27;re made with lead &amp; other toxins, but nearly everyone online raves about how their line is the Rolls Royce of make-up brushes, they last forever, yadda-yadda.</li>
            <li> It just really helps apply very little liquid makeup onto entire face.</li>
            <li> The bristles are so soft... shedding is very minimal and close to none.</li>
            <li> A few weeks ago I spent $42 to buy the MAC 187, my first ever MAC brush.</li>
            <li> and I know they will last me a long time.</li>
            <li> I bought three Sigma brushes for my wife (DUO FIBRE F80, DUO FIBRE F50, PRECISION FLAT P80)</li>
            <li> longer than the MAC, which I prefer because I have long fingers.</li>
            <li> Not only are the bristles shedding, but the black dye from the bottom bristles travelled upwards to the white part!</li>
            <li> The brush gives a good application of foundation and makes it look very natural but that shedding is really annoying!</li>
            <li> The brush gives a good application of your foundation and makes it look very natural but that shedding is really annoying!</li>
            <li> Then, after owning this brush for just 3 months, it started bleeding dark blue dye when I washed it.  </li>
            <li> The white bristles applied my liquid foundation and the black bristles blended it for an almost airburshed look.  </li>
            <li> The only problem with it was the the cover that came with it to protect the bristles had come off, thus leaving the bristles a little bent and altered.</li>
            <li> And like another review said, it left black dye on my face as I was blending the foundation!</li>
            <li> and it did not leave any streaks and blended EXTREMELY well.</li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t make your makeup look cakey like other brushes do.</li>
            <li> Yes, I had problems with the brush shedding, as other reviewers noted.  </li>
            <li> I gave the product four stars; the texture of the brush hair is soft, but some the hairs have already broken off.</li>
            <li> but they&#x27;re slightly softer &amp; silkier.</li>
            <li> brush was unusable because, in addition to the little black brush hairs I had to pick off my face, the dye bled into my foundation.</li>
            <li> I had hoped that the shedding would stop after I washed the brush a few times, but it only got worse.  </li>
            <li> but, after using for a few times and washed twice, I still find a hair or two stuck on my face!</li>
            <li> I use it everyday!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for the past 4 days and keep getting compliments.</li>
            <li> My friend knows her makeup and recommended the Sigma stippling brush to me, even over MAC or any other expensive brand.</li>
            <li> Yes, they are a little expensive</li>
            <li> you won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
            <li> Now I have this weird grayish brush that sheds like crazy and leaves fibers all over my face.</li>
            <li> You will NOT be sorry!</li>
            <li> Sad!</li>
            <li> I used to be hesitant to use liquid foundation because I hate it when it looks caked on.</li>
            <li> VERY unhappy at this point!!!</li>
            <li> Horrible.</li>
            <li> quality brush, i saw on you tube and decide to buy, you will not be disappointed by the quality of this brush!!!</li>

            <li> Timely delivery and product was as promised.</li>
            <li> My friend knows her makeup and recommended the Sigma stippling brush to me, even over MAC or any other expensive brand. I have been using it for awhile now, and the bristles are so soft and the foundation goes on flawlessly. I feel like it was airbrushed on. I can&#x27;t say how long it will last for, but for the price it is definitely worth the investment!</li>
            <li> I LOVE SIGMA! Better than MAC</li>
            <li> I think it is one of the best brushes from Sigma Beauty. My wife loves this Sigma brush very much!</li>
            <li> I love this brush for applying my liquid foundation, it really does what it says it does and makes your makeup look airbrushed. I highly recommend this brush if you use liquid foundation!</li>
            <li> This brush is a must for applying liquid foundation. You get an airbrushed look! Item was shipped quickly. Good quality brush for the price!</li>
            <li> This is the first time I purchase a sigma brush. I love my brush! Thank you for sending it in a timely manner and packing it so nicely for shipping. The brush was better than expected.</li>
            <li> great for fast foundation application</li>
            <li> What a good good surprise!! I wanted a brush for my liquid foundation and this duo fiber is so smooth!! I love it!! I recommand it to everyone! The shipping to France was fast (10 days) so to european customers: GO!!</li>
            <li> This set was recommended to me by a professional make-up artist in the DC area.  I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase.  Description of contents and thier use included.</li>
            <li> This brush is actually REALLY good. I haven&#x27;t tried the MAC brush so I can&#x27;t really make a comparison, but this brush is still really good. I used it for my liquid foundation and it did not leave any streaks and blended EXTREMELY well. I have trie pd that same foundation with other brushes and this one is by far the best. I would HIGHLY reccomend the brushes to everyone. They are at a very reasonable price for such great quality.!</li>
            <li> I am a pro MUA and I love this brush for creating sheer coverage looks.  The fibers create a pixel effect (similar to technology used in movie animation)  which means there is an airbrush effect, making foundation look like a second skin.  Barely there finish that is even and smooth.  The brush has a great thick handle, for ease of use.</li>
            <li> love this due fiber brushe, its gives such a nice brush effect , i used it for the liquid foundation, and its so easy to clean though.</li>
            <li> Where do i begin? I love this brush!! This has to be like Sigma&#x27;s best brush! I personally find it better than MAC&#x27;s 187! i love everything from the grip of the brush to the synthetic hair its perfect! i defiantly recommend this brush to everyone who wants a perfect flawless skin :)</li>
            <li> I gave the product four stars; the texture of the brush hair is soft, but some the hairs have already broken off. Blends my powder &amp; concealer very well.  So yes I recommend this brush if you want a cheap, good brush.</li>
            <li> I was so excited when I received my brushes in the mail today! They are exactly what I expected and I can&#x27;t wait to use them!! Yes, they are a little expensive but I think the quality is exceptional and I know they will last me a long time.</li>
            <li> Love this brush. I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments on my skin since I started using the brush. It&#x27;s amazing what a difference it makes.</li>
            <li> I ordered this October 29th, today is November 14th and I have yet to receive it...VERY unhappy at this point!!!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this brush!!!! Worth every single penny!!! Soft bristles, durable, picks up product fabulously! YES buy this brush you won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
            <li> This brush evenly spreads &amp; applies your foundation perfectly. It gives you a flawless, soft, airbrush look! I think it is one of the best brushes from sigma. It leaves you with an amazing, flawless face &amp; makes you look amazing in pictures. I 100% recommend this brush to anyone who is looking for a flawless brush for foundation. It also doesn&#x27;t make your makeup look cakey like other brushes do. Once I tried it out it instantly amazed me. I find it even better than my MAC 187 brush! I am really satisfied with this brush &amp; will definitely be repurchasing. It also can be used for blush or highlighter, if you want a soft/subtle pop of application on your face. It gives you great coverage without making your face cakey. LOVE THIS BRUSH!</li>
            <li> Quality is great, arrived fast, true as pictured. Yes I recommend this product and  I plan to purchase again from this site in the future.</li>
            <li> Wish the bristles were a little stiffer, but overall a good quality brush for the price.  Happy to have it.</li>
            <li> Gives the skin a natural, airbrush finish in a matter of seconds! Makes foundation so easy to apply! I love this bush!</li>
            <li> I washed it the first time and noticed shedding but thought it was normal the first time they are washed. but, after using for a few times and washed twice, I still find a hair or two stuck on my face! The brush gives a good application of foundation and makes it look very natural but that shedding is really annoying!</li>
            <li> This is the best brush i have purchased. It blends your foundation in to a flawless look.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Sigma brushes for a while after reviewing numerous&lt;br /&gt;You Tube videos of make up artist.  Good product.</li>
            <li> JUST BUY ANY SIGMA BRUSH, YOU WONT REGRET IT. THEY ALL WORK GUD. I AM A HAPPY CUSTOMER AND I WILL BUY THESE AGAIN!!!!</li>
            <li> Great brush for applying blush!</li>
            <li> OMG!  This brush leaves your makeup looking flawless!!  I love this brush more than my beauty blender!  It leaves no streak marks which is perfect!</li>
            <li> Not the greatest foundation brush, but maybe stippling isn&#x27;t for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It tends to create a lighter coverage than my f80, but it creates a nice finish.</li>
            <li> really love this brush but when I use it to apply my foundation it does come out a but streaky sometimes but it&#x27;s nothing a quick touch of a flat top brush couldn&#x27;t fix</li>
            <li> I use this brush with my powder to apply a finishing coat to seal my foundations with. I love the softness of the bristles and the great application. While, I don&#x27;t use it everyday, I can&#x27;t say much about the life before bristles start falling out, but so far so good!</li>
            <li> A few weeks ago I spent $42 to buy the MAC 187, my first ever MAC brush. I don&#x27;t use MAC cosmetics because they&#x27;re made with lead &amp; other toxins, but nearly everyone online raves about how their line is the Rolls Royce of make-up brushes, they last forever, yadda-yadda. So I thought I&#x27;d buy a MAC brush. I&#x27;ve been using Real Techniques Stippling brush for about a year now with good results, but I always thought the brush head is a bit skimpy &amp; the handle isn&#x27;t wel designed. The bristles are rather short &amp; there could be more of them. But I give Real Techniques full marks because their Stippling brush works well, has held together for more than a year &amp; it never, ever sheds. My new MAC brush sheds like a cheap fur coat every time I use it, even after repeated cleanings! (I guess that&#x27;s because the bristles are a combo of natural &amp; synthetic hairs...?) But my Sigma F-50 arrived today &amp; it works like a charm! The handle is about 3/4 in. longer than the MAC, which I prefer because I have long fingers. The bristles are not quite as dense as the MAC but they&#x27;re slightly softer &amp; silkier. The Sigma gave me a beautiful, air-brushed finish And Didn&#x27;t Shed A Single Hair! :) So my overpriced MAC brush is going in the bathroom drawer as a back-up tool. Wish I&#x27;d saved the receipt so I could return it. Some women say brush shedding is no big deal, they just pick the hairs off their face. But after spending the time to apply a flawless foundation, I hate picking brush hairs off my skin! Assuming it holds up over time, the Sigma F50 will be the last stippling brush you&#x27;ll ever need. I&#x27;ll definitely be buying more of their brushes soon!</li>
            <li> I generally tend to love Sigma brushes. I think they are great quality for the price. However, this brush was such a dud! The brush is not even a month old and the top already came off. I only used it 3 times!!! Horrible. I will say that the three times I used it, I worked beautifully but this is unacceptable. Hopefully no one else has this issue.</li>
            <li> This brush is awesome. High quality and lasts long. I clean my brush every week with soap and water. Spreads foundation so well. Gives you the near flawless look. I DID SAY NEAR FLAWLESS...</li>
            <li> I really like the brush! The finish of makeup is really good, it seems more natural. I recommend! The product has good quality material and looks very good.</li>
            <li> Nice brush - blends smooth and doesn&#x27;t leave bristles all over like the cheap ones!</li>
            <li> I used to be hesitant to use liquid foundation because I hate it when it looks caked on. But after using liquid foundation with this brush, it totally changed my mind. I can apply full coverage foundation without looking cakey. the stippling effect of this brush is fantastic. It also worked with my mineral foundation which is a plus.</li>
            <li> I love this brush. I love all Sigma brushed but this one I use daily.  I use it for applying powder over my liquid foundation.  Easy to clean and make sturdy. These brushes are worth every penny.</li>
            <li> This brush is GREAT! I bought it along with a few other Sigma brushes, and I am NOT sorry that I bought it! These brushes are twenty times better than MAC brushes! I saved so much money buying these brushes and they seriously are the best! You will NOT be sorry! Hurry up and buy these brushes before they go main stream and end up costing way more!</li>
            <li> I like the finish it gives me but it feels too soft.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used from MAC to Synthetic Kabuki brushes and for the price i guess i was expecting it to be a little better. But it does leave my face looking flawless.</li>
            <li> I received this brush in a 12-pack kit of brushes that Sigma sells and couldn&#x27;t wait to try it. I washed it the first time and noticed shedding/bleeding which seems to be normal for a lot of brushes the first time they are washed. However, every time I use it to put on my foundation, I always find a hair or two stuck on my face! The brush gives a good application of your foundation and makes it look very natural but that shedding is really annoying! Also, I noticed that the hairs on the sides started getting \\&quot;frizzy\\&quot; and not in line with the rest.</li>
            <li> This brush is fantastic! I love it and highly recommend it. It shipped to me fast so I was very happy about that!</li>
            <li> First of... the product arrived earlier than expected, in great condition and true to its description... delivers an airbrushed finish upon application of foundation. The bristles are so soft... shedding is very minimal and close to none. Love the product and worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I had previously used a friends duo fibre-F50 brush and I absolutely fell in love with it. I had to get one of my own and I cannot wait to use it.</li>
            <li> I bought three Sigma brushes for my wife (DUO FIBRE F80, DUO FIBRE F50, PRECISION FLAT P80) and she loved the quality of the brushes.&lt;br /&gt;I surprised her with this gift and Sigma beauty surprised her with the additional gift that they sent to her (a SHORT SHADER E20 brush).&lt;br /&gt;Also she want me to say in this review that she recommends Sigma beauty brushes!!!</li>
            <li> quality brush, i saw on you tube and decide to buy, you will not be disappointed by the quality of this brush!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy no complains</li>
            <li> Great Purchase and excellent seller</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this brush! I use it everyday!</li>
            <li> I really really love this brush. I&#x27;ve been using it for the past 4 days and keep getting compliments. It just really helps apply very little liquid makeup onto entire face. I&#x27;ve used my fingers before and my fingers just don&#x27;t do a very good job of spreading evenly on my face. I really love this brush. This was delivered on time so I gave it 4 stars because so far so good!</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m in love. this brush makes everything airbrushed on my face. Its super soft. Not as dense but that&#x27;s ok. It blends out nicely.</li>
            <li> This was the first stippling brush I ever owned and I loved the effect it achieved. I don&#x27;t know how I lived without one for so many years.  The white bristles applied my liquid foundation and the black bristles blended it for an almost airburshed look.  Yes, I had problems with the brush shedding, as other reviewers noted.  But I was able to live with the little black hairs left behind on my face as they were easily picked off.  I had hoped that the shedding would stop after I washed the brush a few times, but it only got worse.  Then, after owning this brush for just 3 months, it started bleeding dark blue dye when I washed it.  I hoped the bleeding would stop after a while, but it didn&#x27;t.  It got to the point that I could put the brush in a glass of water and it would look like a big bucket o&#x27;dye in a couple minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush was unusable because, in addition to the little black brush hairs I had to pick off my face, the dye bled into my foundation. While this left my face a very interesting shade of blue, it was not the effect I was hoping to achieve.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be looking for another stippling brush to replace this one, but the brand I buy will not be Sigma.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a stipple brush that won&#x27;t shed.  This is it!  Very happy with this product.  It FAR exceeds the one I purchased from the Laura Mercier counter at a major department store.</li>
            <li> I recently lost my MAC 187 brush but couldn&#x27;t get myself to pay another $42 for another one, so I brought this more economical brush instead for a fraction of the price. I&#x27;m glad I did, because this brush is high quality and nearly identical to the MAC&#x27;s version. The quality is just as good and applies liquid foundation evenly and perfectly. You skin will look airbrushed if you stipple the foundation on and do soft circular motions to blend it in. No shedding so far, and the bristles are extremely soft. Why pay all that money at MAC when you can buy a cheaper brush from Sigma that performs exactly the same? I highly recommend this one!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT 11/24/12- I loved this brush for the first two weeks but after a few washes, it started shedding like crazy! I wash my brushes gently with mild brush cleaner and dry and store them correctly, so I&#x27;m not sure why this happened. Not only are the bristles shedding, but the black dye from the bottom bristles travelled upwards to the white part! Now I have this weird grayish brush that sheds like crazy and leaves fibers all over my face. And like another review said, it left black dye on my face as I was blending the foundation! Sad! I wanted to love this one, but I&#x27;ll stick with my Sigma kabuki which hasn&#x27;t given me any problems.</li>
            <li> This brush is definitely not a fake, upon opening I noticed how soft the bristles were. The only problem with it was the the cover that came with it to protect the bristles had come off, thus leaving the bristles a little bent and altered. Other than that I will look forward to using this product :)</li>
            <li> I completely recommend this product to anyone looking for a good makeup brush. The quality is great and you can&#x27;t beat the price! This can be used for liquid, cream, or mineral foundation and there is no shedding. Love this brush!</li>
