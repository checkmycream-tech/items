    <ol>

            <li>Excellent product.</li>
            <li>Great exfoliating cleanser!</li>
            <li>The grain of the exfoliant is of perfect fineness.</li>
            <li>Since the beginning of my use (three months ago), it has cleared up my skin beautifully!</li>
            <li>Great stuff!</li>
            <li>I used Murad products 20 years ago, and was very happy with them, but this revelation disappoints me.</li>
            <li>I think it is one of the best cleansers around</li>
            <li>Best exfoiliating face wash</li>
            <li>They are the best face cleansers on the market.</li>
            <li>It was on my Christmas List and Amazon had the best price.  </li>

            <li>Happy to say, this stuff is awesome and doesn&#x27;t make me break out.  </li>
            <li>Both of these being AHA&#x27;s, they are hydrophilic and exfoliate the skin from the surface, which is ideal in anti-aging and texture-improving applications.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So yeah, if you have skin like mine - this is great.</li>
            <li>Great price - I knew it was a great product.  </li>
            <li>great for 3 times a week</li>

            <li>This is great.</li>
            <li>I use a couple times per week and my face looks great.</li>

            <li>great product, great price.  </li>
            <li>Great product in a travel size.  </li>
            <li>This is a great Exfoilator.  </li>
            <li>&gt; Just from reading the information on the tube I can tell this is a great exfoliating product: it packs a threefold punch with Alpha Hydroxy Acids, Beta Hydroxy Acid and exfoliating texture</li>
            <li>This makes my skin look and feel great.  </li>
            <li>It feels amazing to use too!</li>
            <li>Good product, great price?</li>
            <li>Easily the best exfoliator I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
            <li>I thought this one one be good since it had both AHAs and BHAs.</li>
            <li>This cleanser is wonderful and leaves my skin silky smooth.  </li>
            <li>I have always used good products for my skin care but couldn&#x27;t find a satisfactory exfoliator.</li>
            <li>I decided to try Murad because of the good reviews I read on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Despite what some say, the product line is consistently good and delivers on it&#x27;s promise.</li>
            <li>I do still use it on my hands and body in the shower as it is a good exfoliator but will not order it again.</li>
            <li>Leaves my skin feeling clean but it isn&#x27;t the best exfoliator I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li>Very good cleanser, I love it, but make sure you do NOT use every day!</li>
            <li>Works great for many skin types.</li>
            <li>Love this product, my skin feels great after washing my face.</li>
            <li>This product is really good for exfoliating and giving your skin a nice glow.</li>
            <li>I have used this product for over 4 years and absolutely love it!</li>
            <li>I will be buying more once it runs out!</li>
            <li>I love it also!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>This is a permanent feature in my skin-care regiment and I love it!</li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I love this cleanser!  </li>
            <li>THIS PRODUCT IS AMAZING ON MY SKIN.</li>
            <li>Its amazing what this and all Murad products will deliver results.</li>
            <li>This is an amazing cleanser/exfoliator at an amazing price.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 28 &amp; have started focusing on anti-aging regimens, so this product fits in nicely</li>
            <li>It exfoliates/ cleans face nicely as well.</li>
            <li>Best cleanser I have found so far.  </li>
            <li>Best face wash for sensitive acne prone skin.</li>
            <li>The combination of this cleanser and a good ingrown hair treatment has kept me smooth.  </li>
            <li>Nice to save some money on my favorite exfoliating cleanser.</li>
            <li>great delivery right to your door.  </li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s really perfect for exactly what I need it for: that transitional time between acne products and full blown anti aging products.</li>
            <li>I experienced that a lot at first, but not anymore now.</li>
            <li>Works great and fast shipment!</li>
            <li>Be very sure to wear sunscreen, you will burn very quickly and easily if you do not.</li>
            <li>I love this exfoliator.</li>
            <li>I plan to buy more.</li>
            <li>You wouldn&#x27;t be able to tell from looking at my skin now that I ever had issues with acne.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for over 10 years and love it.</li>
            <li>, the BHA part of this is salicyliac acid, which clears up my skin wonderfully, leaving my pores smaller, no black/whiteheads and a rejuvenated glow.</li>
            <li>I really love this product.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I LOVE THE MURAD LINE.</li>
            <li>HAS NEVER LOOKED BETTER.</li>
            <li>I find this as the BEST facial cleanser I have ever used.</li>
            <li>I make sure to avoid it in my shampoo, and I wouldn&#x27;t have purchased this if I had seen it in a list of ingredients for this cleanser.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>It really is my favorite exfoliator.</li>
            <li>&amp; I&#x27;m sure that with extended use, I&#x27;ll see better results.</li>
            <li>While I&#x27;d recommend it to others, I wouldn&#x27;t view it as a magical &#x27;cure-all.&#x27;</li>
            <li>My favorite Murad cleanser is still the Vitamin C one.</li>
            <li>Also leaves skin feeling nice and smooth afterwards.</li>
            <li>LOVE IT&lt;</li>
            <li>My skin is oily and I find that if I exfoliate too often it makes it more oily.  </li>
            <li>but I get more in the 20&#x27;s comment.</li>
            <li>Used only 3 times a week and my skin looks amazing!!!</li>
            <li>I am so glad I did,</li>
            <li>I love this cleanser.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an okay product.</li>
            <li>Like I said its just okay.</li>
            <li>It has cleared up and looks better than when I was using the Murad Anti-Aging Acne skin line.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>LOVE this product.</li>
            <li>I like that its a flip top, squeeze bottle.  </li>
            <li>The Alpha Hydroxy Acids in this product are Lactic Acid, a gentler chemical exfoliator, and Glycolic Acid, a slightly more aggressive chemical exfoliator.</li>
            <li>Perhaps if you used a Murad serum or moisturizer it would work better?</li>
            <li>This is the best facial cleanser out there...</li>
            <li>Feels very clean afterwards.</li>
            <li>Nice pleasant smell and not rough on your skin.  </li>
            <li>I moisturize with a rich hydrant and am much more pleased with my skin.</li>
            <li>and I love how smooth my face feels after I wash with it.</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon for good products and helpful reviews.</li>
            <li>The number of pimples has reduced significantly and I love the way my skin looks.</li>
            <li>Murad has been so great-I love the wash products, and the price is great for a bigger bottle!</li>
            <li>very  mild cleanser - I like it a lot .</li>
            <li>But, I am here to stand strong for this&lt;</li>
            <li>Whata amazing clean and fresh sensation, this product is top-notch!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Hands down the best face wash.</li>
            <li>I just did a couple of TCA 30% acid peels and they did wonders for erasing fine lines and hyper-pigmentation from my face as well as brightening.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;the light come through.  </li>
            <li>In between, I use the murad clarifying cleanser and toner and its a fabulous combo.</li>
            <li>You will enjoy the benefits.</li>
            <li>I bought this product because they use Murad products at Massage Envy where I go for my facials, and it is such a great product.</li>
            <li>I want to keep my skin free from anything returning (soon), so I purchased this cleanser</li>
            <li>I am still not acne free but this does well controlling oil.</li>
            <li>I continue on with my skin care regimen: toner, serum, light moisturizer.</li>
            <li>It is gentle yet also incredibly effective and not greasy at all.      </li>
            <li>Cleanser arrived sealed and securely packed.</li>
            <li>It is creamy, gentle and has very fine exfoliating beads that dissolve easily.  </li>
            <li>Like I said, this product is an amazing multi tasker and I highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li>I was expecting a more intense experience, it is actually a very gentle clenser, has a very fine &amp;#34;grit&amp;#34; when it comes to the scrub aspect and is on the creamier side.</li>
            <li>So far, I&#x27;ve been very pleased.  </li>
            <li>Worth the money!</li>
            <li>I got $10 off of what the original price would be.</li>
            <li>I wanted something to help clean out my pores and get rid of blackheads.</li>
            <li>But overall- amazing smooth scrub!</li>
            <li>After I use it, my skin looks clean, polished, even-toned, and my pores are minimized after just one use.     </li>
            <li>Two to three times a week is good enough.</li>
            <li>My favorite part about this purchase is still the fact that I got it much cheaper than retail.</li>
            <li>so I haven&#x27;t been able to use much of anything on it without breaking out.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not pricey if you plan on spending this much money for a product that lasts for about 6-9 months or more.</li>
            <li>Good companion to larger size of this product.</li>
            <li>so I was really hoping this would do more to combat that.</li>
            <li>This is great for a few times a week to exfoliate and leaves your skin smooth and silky.</li>
            <li>I have acne and this is one of my favorite washes and one of the better methods of controlling my blemishes even though it&#x27;s technically an anti aging wash</li>
            <li>Now, as mentioned before, that was after the very first use.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re just starting a facial regime and don&#x27;t know where to start, I believe after you do some research, you will find that glycolic, lactic, &amp; salicylic acids work great and give better results when utilized together - so this product delivers that.  </li>
            <li>I love it, my face was brighter, it really removes the dead skin, great product</li>
            <li>but I noticed results the very first time I used it.</li>
            <li>this stuff makes my skin feel fabulous; clean, soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>Anyone who wants a glowing complexion, give this a try!!</li>
            <li>First ingredient is Sodium Laureth Sulfate (after water)!  </li>
            <li>Not for makeup removal, but great for dead skin removal.</li>
            <li>The product also really works and leaves my face feeling smooth and looking fresh.  </li>
            <li>I have mature, sensitive skin and this product from Murad is so good, I can use it EVERY NIGHT.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is worth every penny</li>
            <li>This is by far my favorite cleaners.</li>
            <li>it is worth every penny.</li>
            <li>I am not crazy for the &amp;#34;milky&amp;#34; feel.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had better results with this product than with professional chemical peels.  </li>
            <li>I have been using Murad products for about 10yrs and at 47 many think I am 25 or 30yrs old</li>
            <li>What I really love about it is that it is not harsh so it won&#x27;t irritate your skin, nor does it feel like you&#x27;re scraping your skin off when you scrub.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>If you look at the ingredients, they are the same used in the popular ingrown hair serums (BHA, AHA and lactic acid).  </li>
            <li>but well worth every penny.</li>
            <li>Has definitely reduced my acne, brighten my complexion, and causes zero irritation of any kind.</li>
            <li>In my experience it&#x27;s surprisingly safe for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very gentle on this sensitive skin of mine and works so well and so mild that I can use it more than once day if I wish.</li>
            <li>they they deep into the pores and clean them out effectively but gently.</li>
            <li>Other wise i will recommend it.</li>
            <li>In terms of fading my acne scars I can&#x27;t really tell a significant difference after 2 weeks of using it three  times a week.</li>
            <li>I do feel my skin is smoother right after washing but its no miracle wash.</li>
            <li>Seems to really help clean up my face and also seems to have some benefit for razor bumps</li>
            <li>The chemical exfoliator is the alpha hydroxy acids and beta hydroxy acids, like lactic acid and salicylic acid, which just gets rid of skin cells on top chemically, which is better than scrubs which can be more harmful and irritating.</li>
            <li>I alternate between the regular cleanser and this product and my skin feels great.</li>
            <li>I alternate it 2-3x/week with Murad&#x27;s Acne Time-release Cleanser for my very problematic skin &amp; it seems to do a nice job.</li>
            <li>Great for old broad&#x27;s skin being 84 years young.</li>
            <li>To start: I am 23 and have sensitive but oily, congested skin and already have some fine lines on my forehead, I also have some freckles/sun damage.</li>
            <li>After the first use my skin felt smoother.</li>
            <li>It instantly shrinks pores and forms more uniform complexion.</li>
            <li>I do not have anything negative to say about this product-it&#x27;s a great wash.</li>
            <li>It has wonderful exfoliating results while being gentle enough to use everyday.</li>
            <li>On the bright side, it lasts along time, 8 months n counting, when I&#x27;m not using it everyday.</li>
            <li>first I used this twice a day</li>
            <li>Be aware, if you have bumps and blemishes under the skin, as you continue to exfoliate, they will come to the surface.</li>
            <li>Makes my face so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>The next morning, my skin looked cleaner, clearer, brighter and definately more polished.</li>
            <li>First time using the Murad line.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>It is a chemical exfoliant, which I personally think shows more results.</li>
            <li>it leaves my skin smooth &amp; soft.</li>
            <li>and I noticed an improvement the first day.</li>
            <li>The beads are small but perfect enough to exfoliate without scratching my face.</li>
            <li>My skin feels so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>When I am finished cleansing with this product my skin is incredibly soft and smooth and has a visibly more even texture, my pores are much smaller and my skin looks \\&quot;tighter\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>This product works amazing if you exfoliate 3 times a week and on the other days you use a quality face soap</li>
            <li>This will make your skin so soft and clean feeling.</li>
            <li>HELPS IT STAY CLEAR, SOFT, REINVIGORATED, AND HEALTHY.</li>
            <li>One benefit of using such an exfoliating cleanser is that your skin will more readily absorb treatments; I follow with a salicylic toner and then an oxygenating serum.</li>
            <li>Since I first started using this product, my skin complexion has improved so much.</li>
            <li>This product was recommended to me after having a facial done at massage envy, I love how smooth this makes my face feel, i&#x27;m currently using it 4x a week.</li>
            <li>but this product is able to exfoliate skin without leaving it dry or irritated.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always had super sensitive skin</li>
            <li>After several weeks of using, my skin is noticeably smoother, light marks are really light, and face is just brighter in general.</li>
            <li>I found my skin started looking a bit dull, breakouts in certain areas, I needed a good exfoliator.</li>
            <li>little beads do a nice job of exfoliating.</li>
            <li>This has little granules in a creamy lotion that foams up nicely.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall I love this product and believe it helps with improving texture, fine lines, sun damage (as long as a strict sunscreen regimine is followed while using this product), clogged pores and probably minor scarring as well.</li>
            <li>I have tried so many products and was skeptical of this but its amazing.</li>
            <li>and it definitely helps smooth my skin.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t feel extra smooth or exfoliated when done using.</li>
            <li>It really does polish your face and make it glow.  </li>
            <li>My skin really doesn&#x27;t like alpha hydroxides</li>
            <li>Seems to work very well.  </li>
            <li>Product got here in a timely fashion and, I believe reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re so gentle on your skin as well.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t think it contains all that much aha/bha.</li>
            <li>Studies call SLS a \\&quot;very corrosive irritant to the skin\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>It exfoliates very well.</li>
            <li>Murad&#x27;s AHA/BHA Exfoliating Cleanser has a very fine-grit, yet creamy texture &amp;</li>
            <li>and you might feel like it doesn&#x27;t do much</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is not too much grit</li>
            <li>I really like this product.  </li>
            <li>The &#x27;dots&#x27; on the bottom really bother me.  </li>
            <li>I have very combination skill.</li>
            <li>next&lt;br /&gt;though really do like PCA collagen hydrator.</li>
            <li>It really primes your skin for moisturizers or treatments.</li>
            <li>but it doesn&#x27;t do too much</li>
            <li>I have only used it a couple of times but each time I have, my skin is so smooth after.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also important when you&#x27;re using such an exfoliating product to moisturize afterwards!</li>
            <li>This cleanser was shipped in a few days of its order and it works very nicely for daily cleansing regime.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this for those who have especially sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I love all of the Murad products, especially as I am 45 years old and am experiencing some adult acne issues.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new to Murad and bought this to help clean my face and fight blackheads and the occasional blemish.  </li>
            <li>After the very first use, my skin felt different, it also felt tingly during the use.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Either way, if you have oily skin I would stick to a drugstore exfoliator or Dermalogica and save yourself the high pricetag of this Exfoliator/Cleanser.</li>
            <li>I was drawn to this product because of my rough, clogged skin, fine lines and sun damage.&lt;br</li>
            <li>A really well developed product.</li>
            <li>dried my skin out, overpriced infective product, I get more results from using soap and water  than this product, dont buy</li>
            <li>This exfoliating cleanser is not only effective in smoothing away dead cells, revealing fresh, younger smoother cells, but it leaves the skin hydrated and soft.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Also, I remembered from 15 years ago as a kid Murad products were the only thing that helped my pretty severe adolescent acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I will continue to use and alternate between this product and another higher strength glycolic (11%) cleanser.  </li>
            <li>At 32, I am told pretty regularly that I look like I&#x27;m 27!!</li>
            <li>Wow I can&#x27;t believe how well this product works!</li>
            <li>I ordered this product, delivery was fast and this product like all the other murad products i have used thus far is no disappointment.</li>
            <li>With my sensitive skin, I always worry that a new product will make me break out, but this didn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li>Not for everyday, but it really keeps my face clean and soft.</li>
            <li>but it still makes my cheeks dry and other areas like my nose more oily then normal.</li>
            <li>This combination has helped my skin to look clear and hydrated.</li>
            <li>skin type and generally clear skin.</li>
            <li>Makes your face feel soft.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin soft.</li>
            <li>A big thanks to my esthetician who recommended it.</li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon for having such competitive prices!</li>
            <li>With all of that, it may sound harsh...</li>
            <li>The directions say to keep it away from eye area, but when you are washing your face there is no way to keep it completely away when using a wash cloth to wipe the face.</li>
            <li>after seeing the reviews for this product and being a long time user of murad I was pretty upset with this product.</li>
            <li>Anyway, I am 30 years old, combo.</li>
            <li>and wow... my skin continues to improve.  </li>
            <li>I will say though that I found a 16.9 fl oz professional size at another site for $35...</li>
            <li>Gentle exfoliation if properly used.  </li>
            <li>(though that is not a noted use as far as I know).</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a soft exfoliant</li>
            <li>My skin is so soft after using this.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive, oily, acne prone skin</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 37 years old and this product has lightened the sun spots and acne scars on my face.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not harsh on the skin.</li>
            <li>I use it twice a week and use something a little more gentle the other days.</li>
            <li>Unlike many beauty products that work well enough but run out fast, a little of this goes a long way.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t feel like much, and it&#x27;s not apparently abrasive.</li>
            <li>I had three areas on my face that were constantly dry and peeling and as I aged the pores on my nose and chin got larger and more problematic.</li>
            <li>Since using it i&#x27;ve noticed my skin is softer, but  if I don&#x27;t follow up with a acne treatment gel I break out more then usual the next day.</li>
            <li>The product eliminates any little dry flakes, dirt, oils, and overall leaves my face incredibly clean and fresh.</li>
            <li>This is a nice daily cleanser with gentle exfoliation, not too gritty or tough for my aging skin.  </li>
            <li>so I searched high and low for a face wash that could rejuvenate my skin.</li>
            <li>When I am done my skin is a little pink for a bit probably from the brush, and slightly more sensitive to products but</li>
            <li>Aside from the tightening of the pores, the light creases in my forehead are less noticeable, and  effect which I hope will increase over time by using this product regularly.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle and it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need to use much and it lasts a long time-</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle yet contains scrubbing exfolliants, lathers well, lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this because I read good reviews on other sites about it&#x27;s ability to fade acne redness and dark marks due to</li>
            <li>The hunt for a new facial cleanser continues.</li>
            <li>On the plus side though, the bottle is huge and would definitely last the average person several months of use!</li>
            <li>only if I use products that normally irritate my skin a little anyway (again, I will mention that my skin is pretty sensitive).</li>
            <li>Lasts long, using daily over 2 months with more than half left.  </li>
            <li>highly recommend trying it, particularly if you are like me: a middle aged woman with oily skin.</li>
            <li>My skin feels so soft and I look years younger.</li>
            <li>I spent so much on it</li>
            <li>I was sure this would irritate it and would make my skin break out even worse.</li>
            <li>Not as obnoxious to use as some other products with large exfoliating beads.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle enough on my sensitive skin that I use it every other day with no irritation.  </li>
            <li>These are smoother than some other texture ingredients in scrubs and also these exfoliating beads are so small you barely notice them, but hypothetically they help open up the skin to be more receptive to the chemical exfoliator (AHA and BHA).&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I cut back to using it every other night and followed up with a soothing face mask (eg oatmeal and honey or pure aloe vera)</li>
            <li>I really see a change in the dark age spot that was building on my face.  </li>
            <li>lasts a long time and keeps your face so so soft.</li>
            <li>I live in Seattle wa, during winter time my skin gets very dry.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive, acne-prone skin and this hasn&#x27;t caused dry spots or breakouts.</li>
            <li>I do chemical exfoliation/peels regularly and still found the first few days with this cleanser</li>
            <li>My pores are smaller and skin is clear but not overly dry.</li>
            <li>When I wake up the next day, my skin is very noticeably brighter, marks have faded slightly.</li>
            <li>I use it daily and really scrub at my face with the little microbeads.</li>
            <li>I use it on my face for a gentle exfoliation and this may sound crazy, but I use it also on my bikini area to prevent ingrown hairs from waxing.  </li>

            <li> Excellent product.</li>
            <li> Great exfoliating cleanser!</li>
            <li> The grain of the exfoliant is of perfect fineness.</li>
            <li> Since the beginning of my use (three months ago), it has cleared up my skin beautifully!</li>
            <li> Great stuff!</li>
            <li> I used Murad products 20 years ago, and was very happy with them, but this revelation disappoints me.</li>
            <li> I think it is one of the best cleansers around</li>
            <li> Best exfoiliating face wash</li>

            <li> Happy to say, this stuff is awesome and doesn&#x27;t make me break out.  </li>
            <li> Both of these being AHA&#x27;s, they are hydrophilic and exfoliate the skin from the surface, which is ideal in anti-aging and texture-improving applications.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So yeah, if you have skin like mine - this is great.</li>
            <li> Great price - I knew it was a great product.  </li>

            <li> This is a great Exfoilator.  </li>
            <li> &gt; Just from reading the information on the tube I can tell this is a great exfoliating product: it packs a threefold punch with Alpha Hydroxy Acids, Beta Hydroxy Acid and exfoliating texture</li>
            <li> This makes my skin look and feel great.  </li>
            <li> It feels amazing to use too!</li>
            <li> Good product, great price?</li>
            <li> Easily the best exfoliator I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>

            <li> This cleanser is wonderful and leaves my skin silky smooth.  </li>
            <li> I have always used good products for my skin care but couldn&#x27;t find a satisfactory exfoliator.</li>
            <li> I decided to try Murad because of the good reviews I read on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Despite what some say, the product line is consistently good and delivers on it&#x27;s promise.</li>
            <li> I do still use it on my hands and body in the shower as it is a good exfoliator but will not order it again.</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin feeling clean but it isn&#x27;t the best exfoliator I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li> Very good cleanser, I love it, but make sure you do NOT use every day!</li>
            <li> Works great for many skin types.</li>
            <li> Love this product, my skin feels great after washing my face.</li>
            <li> This product is really good for exfoliating and giving your skin a nice glow.</li>

            <li> I will be buying more once it runs out!</li>

            <li> I love this cleanser!  </li>
            <li> THIS PRODUCT IS AMAZING ON MY SKIN.</li>
            <li> Its amazing what this and all Murad products will deliver results.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing cleanser/exfoliator at an amazing price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 28 &amp; have started focusing on anti-aging regimens, so this product fits in nicely</li>
            <li> It exfoliates/ cleans face nicely as well.</li>
            <li> Best cleanser I have found so far.  </li>
            <li> Best face wash for sensitive acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> The combination of this cleanser and a good ingrown hair treatment has kept me smooth.  </li>
            <li> Nice to save some money on my favorite exfoliating cleanser.</li>
            <li> great delivery right to your door.  </li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s really perfect for exactly what I need it for: that transitional time between acne products and full blown anti aging products.</li>
            <li> I experienced that a lot at first, but not anymore now.</li>
            <li> Works great and fast shipment!</li>
            <li> Be very sure to wear sunscreen, you will burn very quickly and easily if you do not.</li>
            <li> I love this exfoliator.</li>
            <li> I plan to buy more.</li>
            <li> You wouldn&#x27;t be able to tell from looking at my skin now that I ever had issues with acne.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for over 10 years and love it.</li>
            <li> , the BHA part of this is salicyliac acid, which clears up my skin wonderfully, leaving my pores smaller, no black/whiteheads and a rejuvenated glow.</li>
            <li> I really love this product.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THE MURAD LINE.</li>
            <li> HAS NEVER LOOKED BETTER.</li>
            <li> I find this as the BEST facial cleanser I have ever used.</li>
            <li> I make sure to avoid it in my shampoo, and I wouldn&#x27;t have purchased this if I had seen it in a list of ingredients for this cleanser.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> It really is my favorite exfoliator.</li>
            <li> &amp; I&#x27;m sure that with extended use, I&#x27;ll see better results.</li>
            <li> While I&#x27;d recommend it to others, I wouldn&#x27;t view it as a magical &#x27;cure-all.&#x27;</li>
            <li> My favorite Murad cleanser is still the Vitamin C one.</li>
            <li> Also leaves skin feeling nice and smooth afterwards.</li>
            <li> LOVE IT&lt;</li>
            <li> My skin is oily and I find that if I exfoliate too often it makes it more oily.  </li>
            <li> but I get more in the 20&#x27;s comment.</li>
            <li> Used only 3 times a week and my skin looks amazing!!!</li>
            <li> I am so glad I did,</li>
            <li> I love this cleanser.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an okay product.</li>
            <li> Like I said its just okay.</li>
            <li> It has cleared up and looks better than when I was using the Murad Anti-Aging Acne skin line.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> LOVE this product.</li>
            <li> I like that its a flip top, squeeze bottle.  </li>
            <li> The Alpha Hydroxy Acids in this product are Lactic Acid, a gentler chemical exfoliator, and Glycolic Acid, a slightly more aggressive chemical exfoliator.</li>
            <li> Perhaps if you used a Murad serum or moisturizer it would work better?</li>
            <li> This is the best facial cleanser out there...</li>
            <li> Feels very clean afterwards.</li>
            <li> Nice pleasant smell and not rough on your skin.  </li>
            <li> I moisturize with a rich hydrant and am much more pleased with my skin.</li>
            <li> and I love how smooth my face feels after I wash with it.</li>
            <li> Thanks Amazon for good products and helpful reviews.</li>
            <li> The number of pimples has reduced significantly and I love the way my skin looks.</li>
            <li> Murad has been so great-I love the wash products, and the price is great for a bigger bottle!</li>
            <li> very  mild cleanser - I like it a lot .</li>
            <li> But, I am here to stand strong for this&lt;</li>
            <li> Whata amazing clean and fresh sensation, this product is top-notch!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Hands down the best face wash.</li>
            <li> I just did a couple of TCA 30% acid peels and they did wonders for erasing fine lines and hyper-pigmentation from my face as well as brightening.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;the light come through.  </li>
            <li> In between, I use the murad clarifying cleanser and toner and its a fabulous combo.</li>
            <li> You will enjoy the benefits.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because they use Murad products at Massage Envy where I go for my facials, and it is such a great product.</li>
            <li> I want to keep my skin free from anything returning (soon), so I purchased this cleanser</li>
            <li> I am still not acne free but this does well controlling oil.</li>
            <li> I continue on with my skin care regimen: toner, serum, light moisturizer.</li>
            <li> It is gentle yet also incredibly effective and not greasy at all.      </li>
            <li> Cleanser arrived sealed and securely packed.</li>
            <li> It is creamy, gentle and has very fine exfoliating beads that dissolve easily.  </li>
            <li> Like I said, this product is an amazing multi tasker and I highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li> I was expecting a more intense experience, it is actually a very gentle clenser, has a very fine &amp;#34;grit&amp;#34; when it comes to the scrub aspect and is on the creamier side.</li>
            <li> So far, I&#x27;ve been very pleased.  </li>
            <li> Worth the money!</li>
            <li> I got $10 off of what the original price would be.</li>
            <li> I wanted something to help clean out my pores and get rid of blackheads.</li>
            <li> But overall- amazing smooth scrub!</li>
            <li> After I use it, my skin looks clean, polished, even-toned, and my pores are minimized after just one use.     </li>
            <li> Two to three times a week is good enough.</li>
            <li> My favorite part about this purchase is still the fact that I got it much cheaper than retail.</li>
            <li> so I haven&#x27;t been able to use much of anything on it without breaking out.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not pricey if you plan on spending this much money for a product that lasts for about 6-9 months or more.</li>
            <li> Good companion to larger size of this product.</li>
            <li> so I was really hoping this would do more to combat that.</li>
            <li> This is great for a few times a week to exfoliate and leaves your skin smooth and silky.</li>
            <li> I have acne and this is one of my favorite washes and one of the better methods of controlling my blemishes even though it&#x27;s technically an anti aging wash</li>
            <li> Now, as mentioned before, that was after the very first use.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re just starting a facial regime and don&#x27;t know where to start, I believe after you do some research, you will find that glycolic, lactic, &amp; salicylic acids work great and give better results when utilized together - so this product delivers that.  </li>
            <li> I love it, my face was brighter, it really removes the dead skin, great product</li>
            <li> but I noticed results the very first time I used it.</li>
            <li> this stuff makes my skin feel fabulous; clean, soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> Anyone who wants a glowing complexion, give this a try!!</li>
            <li> First ingredient is Sodium Laureth Sulfate (after water)!  </li>
            <li> Not for makeup removal, but great for dead skin removal.</li>
            <li> The product also really works and leaves my face feeling smooth and looking fresh.  </li>
            <li> I have mature, sensitive skin and this product from Murad is so good, I can use it EVERY NIGHT.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is worth every penny</li>
            <li> This is by far my favorite cleaners.</li>
            <li> it is worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I am not crazy for the &amp;#34;milky&amp;#34; feel.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had better results with this product than with professional chemical peels.  </li>
            <li> I have been using Murad products for about 10yrs and at 47 many think I am 25 or 30yrs old</li>
            <li> What I really love about it is that it is not harsh so it won&#x27;t irritate your skin, nor does it feel like you&#x27;re scraping your skin off when you scrub.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> If you look at the ingredients, they are the same used in the popular ingrown hair serums (BHA, AHA and lactic acid).  </li>
            <li> but well worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Has definitely reduced my acne, brighten my complexion, and causes zero irritation of any kind.</li>
            <li> In my experience it&#x27;s surprisingly safe for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very gentle on this sensitive skin of mine and works so well and so mild that I can use it more than once day if I wish.</li>
            <li> they they deep into the pores and clean them out effectively but gently.</li>
            <li> Other wise i will recommend it.</li>
            <li> In terms of fading my acne scars I can&#x27;t really tell a significant difference after 2 weeks of using it three  times a week.</li>
            <li> I do feel my skin is smoother right after washing but its no miracle wash.</li>
            <li> Seems to really help clean up my face and also seems to have some benefit for razor bumps</li>
            <li> The chemical exfoliator is the alpha hydroxy acids and beta hydroxy acids, like lactic acid and salicylic acid, which just gets rid of skin cells on top chemically, which is better than scrubs which can be more harmful and irritating.</li>
            <li> I alternate between the regular cleanser and this product and my skin feels great.</li>
            <li> I alternate it 2-3x/week with Murad&#x27;s Acne Time-release Cleanser for my very problematic skin &amp; it seems to do a nice job.</li>
            <li> Great for old broad&#x27;s skin being 84 years young.</li>
            <li> To start: I am 23 and have sensitive but oily, congested skin and already have some fine lines on my forehead, I also have some freckles/sun damage.</li>
            <li> After the first use my skin felt smoother.</li>
            <li> It instantly shrinks pores and forms more uniform complexion.</li>
            <li> I do not have anything negative to say about this product-it&#x27;s a great wash.</li>
            <li> It has wonderful exfoliating results while being gentle enough to use everyday.</li>
            <li> On the bright side, it lasts along time, 8 months n counting, when I&#x27;m not using it everyday.</li>
            <li> first I used this twice a day</li>
            <li> Be aware, if you have bumps and blemishes under the skin, as you continue to exfoliate, they will come to the surface.</li>
            <li> Makes my face so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> The next morning, my skin looked cleaner, clearer, brighter and definately more polished.</li>
            <li> First time using the Murad line.</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> It is a chemical exfoliant, which I personally think shows more results.</li>
            <li> it leaves my skin smooth &amp; soft.</li>
            <li> and I noticed an improvement the first day.</li>
            <li> The beads are small but perfect enough to exfoliate without scratching my face.</li>
            <li> My skin feels so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> When I am finished cleansing with this product my skin is incredibly soft and smooth and has a visibly more even texture, my pores are much smaller and my skin looks \\&quot;tighter\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> This product works amazing if you exfoliate 3 times a week and on the other days you use a quality face soap</li>
            <li> This will make your skin so soft and clean feeling.</li>
            <li> HELPS IT STAY CLEAR, SOFT, REINVIGORATED, AND HEALTHY.</li>
            <li> One benefit of using such an exfoliating cleanser is that your skin will more readily absorb treatments; I follow with a salicylic toner and then an oxygenating serum.</li>
            <li> Since I first started using this product, my skin complexion has improved so much.</li>
            <li> This product was recommended to me after having a facial done at massage envy, I love how smooth this makes my face feel, i&#x27;m currently using it 4x a week.</li>
            <li> but this product is able to exfoliate skin without leaving it dry or irritated.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had super sensitive skin</li>
            <li> After several weeks of using, my skin is noticeably smoother, light marks are really light, and face is just brighter in general.</li>
            <li> I found my skin started looking a bit dull, breakouts in certain areas, I needed a good exfoliator.</li>
            <li> little beads do a nice job of exfoliating.</li>
            <li> This has little granules in a creamy lotion that foams up nicely.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall I love this product and believe it helps with improving texture, fine lines, sun damage (as long as a strict sunscreen regimine is followed while using this product), clogged pores and probably minor scarring as well.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many products and was skeptical of this but its amazing.</li>
            <li> and it definitely helps smooth my skin.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t feel extra smooth or exfoliated when done using.</li>
            <li> It really does polish your face and make it glow.  </li>
            <li> My skin really doesn&#x27;t like alpha hydroxides</li>
            <li> Seems to work very well.  </li>
            <li> Product got here in a timely fashion and, I believe reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re so gentle on your skin as well.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t think it contains all that much aha/bha.</li>
            <li> Studies call SLS a \\&quot;very corrosive irritant to the skin\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> It exfoliates very well.</li>
            <li> Murad&#x27;s AHA/BHA Exfoliating Cleanser has a very fine-grit, yet creamy texture &amp;</li>
            <li> and you might feel like it doesn&#x27;t do much</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is not too much grit</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  </li>
            <li> The &#x27;dots&#x27; on the bottom really bother me.  </li>
            <li> I have very combination skill.</li>
            <li> next&lt;br /&gt;though really do like PCA collagen hydrator.</li>
            <li> It really primes your skin for moisturizers or treatments.</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t do too much</li>
            <li> I have only used it a couple of times but each time I have, my skin is so smooth after.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also important when you&#x27;re using such an exfoliating product to moisturize afterwards!</li>
            <li> This cleanser was shipped in a few days of its order and it works very nicely for daily cleansing regime.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this for those who have especially sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I love all of the Murad products, especially as I am 45 years old and am experiencing some adult acne issues.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to Murad and bought this to help clean my face and fight blackheads and the occasional blemish.  </li>
            <li> After the very first use, my skin felt different, it also felt tingly during the use.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Either way, if you have oily skin I would stick to a drugstore exfoliator or Dermalogica and save yourself the high pricetag of this Exfoliator/Cleanser.</li>
            <li> I was drawn to this product because of my rough, clogged skin, fine lines and sun damage.&lt;br</li>
            <li> A really well developed product.</li>
            <li> dried my skin out, overpriced infective product, I get more results from using soap and water  than this product, dont buy</li>
            <li> This exfoliating cleanser is not only effective in smoothing away dead cells, revealing fresh, younger smoother cells, but it leaves the skin hydrated and soft.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Also, I remembered from 15 years ago as a kid Murad products were the only thing that helped my pretty severe adolescent acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I will continue to use and alternate between this product and another higher strength glycolic (11%) cleanser.  </li>
            <li> At 32, I am told pretty regularly that I look like I&#x27;m 27!!</li>
            <li> Wow I can&#x27;t believe how well this product works!</li>
            <li> I ordered this product, delivery was fast and this product like all the other murad products i have used thus far is no disappointment.</li>
            <li> With my sensitive skin, I always worry that a new product will make me break out, but this didn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> Not for everyday, but it really keeps my face clean and soft.</li>
            <li> but it still makes my cheeks dry and other areas like my nose more oily then normal.</li>
            <li> This combination has helped my skin to look clear and hydrated.</li>
            <li> skin type and generally clear skin.</li>
            <li> Makes your face feel soft.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin soft.</li>
            <li> A big thanks to my esthetician who recommended it.</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Thanks Amazon for having such competitive prices!</li>
            <li> With all of that, it may sound harsh...</li>
            <li> The directions say to keep it away from eye area, but when you are washing your face there is no way to keep it completely away when using a wash cloth to wipe the face.</li>
            <li> after seeing the reviews for this product and being a long time user of murad I was pretty upset with this product.</li>
            <li> Anyway, I am 30 years old, combo.</li>
            <li> and wow... my skin continues to improve.  </li>
            <li> I will say though that I found a 16.9 fl oz professional size at another site for $35...</li>
            <li> Gentle exfoliation if properly used.  </li>
            <li> (though that is not a noted use as far as I know).</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s a soft exfoliant</li>
            <li> My skin is so soft after using this.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive, oily, acne prone skin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 37 years old and this product has lightened the sun spots and acne scars on my face.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not harsh on the skin.</li>
            <li> I use it twice a week and use something a little more gentle the other days.</li>
            <li> Unlike many beauty products that work well enough but run out fast, a little of this goes a long way.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t feel like much, and it&#x27;s not apparently abrasive.</li>
            <li> I had three areas on my face that were constantly dry and peeling and as I aged the pores on my nose and chin got larger and more problematic.</li>
            <li> Since using it i&#x27;ve noticed my skin is softer, but  if I don&#x27;t follow up with a acne treatment gel I break out more then usual the next day.</li>
            <li> The product eliminates any little dry flakes, dirt, oils, and overall leaves my face incredibly clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> This is a nice daily cleanser with gentle exfoliation, not too gritty or tough for my aging skin.  </li>
            <li> so I searched high and low for a face wash that could rejuvenate my skin.</li>
            <li> When I am done my skin is a little pink for a bit probably from the brush, and slightly more sensitive to products but</li>
            <li> Aside from the tightening of the pores, the light creases in my forehead are less noticeable, and  effect which I hope will increase over time by using this product regularly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gentle and it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need to use much and it lasts a long time-</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gentle yet contains scrubbing exfolliants, lathers well, lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this because I read good reviews on other sites about it&#x27;s ability to fade acne redness and dark marks due to</li>
            <li> The hunt for a new facial cleanser continues.</li>
            <li> On the plus side though, the bottle is huge and would definitely last the average person several months of use!</li>
            <li> only if I use products that normally irritate my skin a little anyway (again, I will mention that my skin is pretty sensitive).</li>
            <li> Lasts long, using daily over 2 months with more than half left.  </li>
            <li> highly recommend trying it, particularly if you are like me: a middle aged woman with oily skin.</li>
            <li> My skin feels so soft and I look years younger.</li>
            <li> I spent so much on it</li>
            <li> I was sure this would irritate it and would make my skin break out even worse.</li>
            <li> Not as obnoxious to use as some other products with large exfoliating beads.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gentle enough on my sensitive skin that I use it every other day with no irritation.  </li>
            <li> These are smoother than some other texture ingredients in scrubs and also these exfoliating beads are so small you barely notice them, but hypothetically they help open up the skin to be more receptive to the chemical exfoliator (AHA and BHA).&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I cut back to using it every other night and followed up with a soothing face mask (eg oatmeal and honey or pure aloe vera)</li>
            <li> I really see a change in the dark age spot that was building on my face.  </li>
            <li> lasts a long time and keeps your face so so soft.</li>
            <li> I live in Seattle wa, during winter time my skin gets very dry.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive, acne-prone skin and this hasn&#x27;t caused dry spots or breakouts.</li>
            <li> I do chemical exfoliation/peels regularly and still found the first few days with this cleanser</li>
            <li> My pores are smaller and skin is clear but not overly dry.</li>
            <li> When I wake up the next day, my skin is very noticeably brighter, marks have faded slightly.</li>
            <li> I use it daily and really scrub at my face with the little microbeads.</li>
            <li> I use it on my face for a gentle exfoliation and this may sound crazy, but I use it also on my bikini area to prevent ingrown hairs from waxing.  </li>
            <li> However I would avoid exfoliation  (especially chemical exfoliation as in this product) if your skin is extremely sensitive and/or irritated by other products or treatments.</li>
            <li> When I first got it, the product said that it was a daily cleanser, but when I used it everyday, it made my skin very dry.</li>
            <li> I wet my face first, then apply a small amount over my entire face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this cleaner for over 4 years now and it&#x27;s the only thing that doesn&#x27;t irritate my face or dry it out.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive, combination skin and this is one of the only products that I have used that hasn&#x27;t dried out my skin or caused breakouts upon using it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because it makes my eyelids very dry and somewhat irritated.  </li>
            <li> Beta Hydroxy Acid is salicylic acid, which penetrates the oil in pores and exfoliates them from inside: because of this mode of action BHA is commonly found in acne-treating products but can also help improve texture in congested or oily skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The last method of exfoliation in this product is the very tiny scrubbing beads...</li>
            <li> I could see it being too harsh or drying for mature skin.</li>
            <li> I will be using this product for a long time.  </li>
            <li> I am still getting some blemishes, but those typically are more difficult to get rid of anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After only 4 days use my black heads are almost gone and my pores smaller.</li>
            <li> But the only thing you have to be careful is not getting a Dry face after using.</li>
            <li> Of course, in between that time i switch to other skincare as the skin i find tends to become used to the same product after a while and therefore do not produce noticeable results.</li>
            <li> Personally, I don&#x27;t use any other cleansers on the other day, so I may have a different experience than others.</li>
            <li> But I don&#x27;t credit all this improvement to this exfoliator, because I also use other products for the same purpose.</li>
            <li> It does tend to dry out my skin a bit</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had any skin issues (dry or oily) since using this product.</li>
            <li> br /&gt;It helps with dry patches it got rid of it in two days!!&lt;br</li>
            <li> because eventhough I have dry skin, I can use this product at bathtime and it works wonders.</li>
            <li> My face now feels leathery and dry.  </li>
            <li> I massage it in for about 5 minutes then rinse off and pat dry.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m pretty tough.</li>
            <li> I told her I have very sensitive, cominbation skin, and was having a hard time finding something that worked for my face.  </li>
            <li> and I noticed I was starting to get slight crows feet.</li>
            <li> I use it with a soft face cleansing brush, wet my skin and the brush, apply the cleanser to the brush and massage it into my skin in small circles.</li>
            <li> If you have dry skin you won&#x27;t need to use it everyday so it will last even longer.</li>
            <li> However, the texture in this product is provided by jojoba esters, basically tiny little beads of the wax-oil jojoba (</li>
            <li> Definitely not too harsh on skin.</li>
            <li> Be careful to not rub over your eyes with it, try to avoid your eyes, because the beads can get into your eye.</li>
            <li> Then, I wash it off, with my eye closed, to avoid getting the beads in my eye.</li>
            <li> when crushed walnut shells are used in scrubs).</li>
            <li> Expensive, yes, but worth it.</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical at first since I have oily skin, which breaks out, and frequently have clogged pores.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I use it every other day with my face wash</li>
            <li> Like this product and all it other companion products for your face, I do feel a difference after using this cleansing cream.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> MURAD is on the expensive side as far as facial products</li>
            <li> my nose dark spots vanished and now my skin tone is extremely even!&lt;br</li>
            <li> and my skin has gone all wonky the last couple of years.  </li>
            <li> I use it at least 3 times a week with my Murad Vitamin C Daily Cleanser.</li>
            <li> I have a little bit of every complexion issue: oily t-zone, dry areas, slight enlarged pores, slight breakouts, slight sun damage, and slight signs of aging.</li>
            <li> so you don&#x27;t feel like you&#x27;re taking your skin down to the bone.  </li>
            <li> This is hands down my fave exfoliating cleanser.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this for about two months, every other night, and my face is just glowing!</li>
            <li> Use no more than twice a week because you don&#x27;t want to over dry your skin.  </li>
            <li> When I don&#x27;t use this cleanser for a couple of weeks, my skin looks dull, a little bit oily, and my pores sadly open up to the world for all to see.  </li>
            <li> Not as harsh as other products I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I use it 2-3 times a week, or less.</li>
            <li> I squeeze a small amount into my palm after I wet my hands, and lather it.</li>
            <li> but then I noticed my face felt and looked too tight.</li>
            <li> My face does feel slightly tight after product use, but I always follow up with a moisturizer (including the nights I don&#x27;t use the Exfoliator).</li>
            <li> I use it everyday and it was half the price that it is at any salon or day spa.</li>
            <li> I find that it can be a little to drying if over used.</li>
            <li> when I scrub my skin with it, it&#x27;s like a slippery gel with little beads in it.</li>
            <li> It gets a little bubbly, then I massage it all over my face and neck, avoiding my eyes of course.</li>
            <li> without mention that this product will last at least 2 months using almost every day!</li>
            <li> are my thoughts on this cleanser: It may be too harsh for your skin if you aren&#x27;t used to using AHA products.</li>
            <li> It has a grit so it removes dead skin,  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t use this everyday, which, of course, I tried to do, isn&#x27;t too exfoliating, and with leave it irritated if I use too often.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m amazed by the results I have seen after just a few days of use.</li>
            <li> waste of money.</li>
            <li> I would not recommend to use it everyday as it says.</li>
            <li> This works without being too harsh.  </li>
            <li> I wish I could use this exfoliator everyday because each time I use it, my skin glows.</li>
            <li> So, I so not enjoy wearing them.</li>
            <li> and I use it everyday.</li>
            <li> I use it every few days and always like how my skin looks and feels.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wanna waste the money I paid for the product.</li>
            <li> I used to have pretty bad acne</li>
            <li> The directions on the back do say to use this only a few times, a week, so that is my bad.  </li>
            <li> I am not personally able to use it everyday though.  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> Makes your face feel soft. Cleans well. I would suggest that you maybe only use this 2 to 3 times a week. I find that it can be a little to drying if over used.</li>
            <li> I love this exfoliator. It makes my skin soft. Unlike many beauty products that work well enough but run out fast, a little of this goes a long way. I plan to buy more.</li>
            <li> I wanted something to help clean out my pores and get rid of blackheads. After the first use my skin felt smoother. It does tend to dry out my skin a bit so I would suggest using moisturizer after.</li>
            <li> Very good cleanser, I love it, but make sure you do NOT use every day! It must be used every 2-3 days! I read it on their website! But overall- amazing smooth scrub!</li>
            <li> I like the way it makes my face feel after using it. I alternate between the regular cleanser and this product and my skin feels great. A big thanks to my esthetician who recommended it.</li>
            <li> Best face wash. Use it almost every day and it definitely helps smooth my skin.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. It instantly shrinks pores and forms more uniform complexion.</li>
            <li> I am 27 with combination skin - meaning seriously a combination of everything. I have a little bit of every complexion issue: oily t-zone, dry areas, slight enlarged pores, slight breakouts, slight sun damage, and slight signs of aging. I have has a difficult time choosing what skin care products to try because of this. I thought this one one be good since it had both AHAs and BHAs. Also, I remembered from 15 years ago as a kid Murad products were the only thing that helped my pretty severe adolescent acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cleanser after 2 weeks has made a noticeable improvement in my skin. My pores are smaller and skin looks brighter and smoother. I am still getting some blemishes, but those typically are more difficult to get rid of anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are my thoughts on this cleanser: It may be too harsh for your skin if you aren&#x27;t used to using AHA products. I do chemical exfoliation/peels regularly and still found the first few days with this cleanser I had some redness and irritation. Also, this cleanser is marketed as an ant-aging cleanser. I could see it being too harsh or drying for mature skin. I think it&#x27;s really perfect for exactly what I need it for: that transitional time between acne products and full blown anti aging products. So yeah, if you have skin like mine - this is great.</li>
            <li> This is great for a few times a week to exfoliate and leaves your skin smooth and silky. It has a grit so it removes dead skin,  It has some type of moisturizer so there is no dryness.</li>
            <li> Murad has been so great-I love the wash products, and the price is great for a bigger bottle! I do not have anything negative to say about this product-it&#x27;s a great wash.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for over 4 years and absolutely love it! I used to have pretty bad acne and once my skin started clearing up I was getting scars on my cheeks from the acne. Since I first started using this product, my skin complexion has improved so much. You wouldn&#x27;t be able to tell from looking at my skin now that I ever had issues with acne. I use it every other day with my face wash and I swear by it! My sister just started using it and she loves it as well.</li>
            <li> I use the clarifying on a daily basis but was told I needed and additional exfoliant, I am not a big fan, I will use up the bottle but I don&#x27;t feel extra smooth or exfoliated when done using.</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin feeling clean but it isn&#x27;t the best exfoliator I&#x27;ve used.  I was a bit disappointed.</li>
            <li> Great exfoliating cleanser! Definitely not too harsh on skin. I have extremely sensitive skin but this product is able to exfoliate skin without leaving it dry or irritated.</li>
            <li> Great price - I knew it was a great product.  Thanks Amazon for having such competitive prices!</li>
            <li> I have mature, sensitive skin and this product from Murad is so good, I can use it EVERY NIGHT. This exfoliating cleanser is not only effective in smoothing away dead cells, revealing fresh, younger smoother cells, but it leaves the skin hydrated and soft. It is not drying at all. I wet my face first, then apply a small amount over my entire face. It is a creamy consistency with Jojoba Beads coupled with Salicylic, Lactic and Glycolic Acid that helps cell turn over. With all of that, it may sound harsh...but it&#x27;s anything but ... It&#x27;s very gentle on this sensitive skin of mine and works so well and so mild that I can use it more than once day if I wish. ..but I don&#x27;t. I only use it at night. I highly recommend this for those who have especially sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I started getting compliments about a week after using it twice a day.  The exfoliate isn&#x27;t too rough, I have sensitive skin and no problems.</li>
            <li> It really does polish your face and make it glow.  Use no more than twice a week because you don&#x27;t want to over dry your skin.  Anyone who wants a glowing complexion, give this a try!!</li>
            <li> I love this product. I use it everyday and it was half the price that it is at any salon or day spa. Works great for many skin types.</li>
            <li> dried my skin out, overpriced infective product, I get more results from using soap and water  than this product, dont buy</li>
            <li> great for 3 times a week</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for over 10 years and love it. It has wonderful exfoliating results while being gentle enough to use everyday. I have sensitive, combination skin and this is one of the only products that I have used that hasn&#x27;t dried out my skin or caused breakouts upon using it.&lt;br /&gt;It is worth every penny and I will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> My skin really doesn&#x27;t like alpha hydroxides, the BHA part of this is salicyliac acid, which clears up my skin wonderfully, leaving my pores smaller, no black/whiteheads and a rejuvenated glow. I can&#x27;t use this everyday, which, of course, I tried to do, isn&#x27;t too exfoliating, and with leave it irritated if I use too often. So I use it maybe once  a week, when I remember. On the bright side, it lasts along time, 8 months n counting, when I&#x27;m not using it everyday.</li>
            <li> I have really bad scars after a bout of hormonal acne. My skin was so bad that no amount of makeup could hide the patches. I don&#x27;t have money for facials so I searched high and low for a face wash that could rejuvenate my skin. I&#x27;m amazed by the results I have seen after just a few days of use. My skin is brighter and smoother and the scars have faded tremendously.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first I used this twice a day but then I noticed my face felt and looked too tight. I cut back to using it every other night and followed up with a soothing face mask (eg oatmeal and honey or pure aloe vera) This combination has helped my skin to look clear and hydrated.</li>
            <li> Works great. Be very sure to wear sunscreen, you will burn very quickly and easily if you do not.</li>
            <li> I have read so not to go remarks about Murad Exfoliating Cleanser.  But, I am here to stand strong for this&lt;br /&gt;product.  I really see a change in the dark age spot that was building on my face.  Now I am starting to see&lt;br /&gt;the light come through.  I will be using this product for a long time.  Once you start to use it on a regular bases&lt;br /&gt;you can&#x27;t help but see a different to your face.  I did and it only took two week.&lt;br /&gt;I am starting to have a glow.  And, I like that a lot.</li>
            <li> This cleanser is wonderful and leaves my skin silky smooth.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because it makes my eyelids very dry and somewhat irritated.  The directions say to keep it away from eye area, but when you are washing your face there is no way to keep it completely away when using a wash cloth to wipe the face.</li>
            <li> after seeing the reviews for this product and being a long time user of murad I was pretty upset with this product. after receiving this product half of it was spilled into the box due to the cap being broken, what little bit I used I would hardly qualify as an exfoliator. waste of money. never again</li>
            <li> This is by far my favorite cleaners. I use it daily and really scrub at my face with the little microbeads. I can tell if I haven&#x27;t used this in a while, because my face starts looking dull/ and I will start getting breakouts. This stuff works wonders!!</li>
            <li> I really love this product. After only one month, my skin is smoother and clearer. Be aware, if you have bumps and blemishes under the skin, as you continue to exfoliate, they will come to the surface. After that, clearer, softer skin!</li>
            <li> Makes my face so soft and smooth. Controls breakouts. Just put a dime size amount on. I use 2-3x a week.</li>
            <li> A really well developed product. This will make your skin so soft and clean feeling. The grain of the exfoliant is of perfect fineness. I will be buying more once it runs out!</li>
            <li> Heard about this product on one of the daytime shows that recommended a cleanser for your face that had AHA on the label.  Seems to work very well.  Only time will tell if the show I watched knew of what they were saying.  Product got here in a timely fashion and, I believe reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> Best cleanser I have found so far.  It not only exfoliates but has AHA&#x27;S for further exfoliation.  I used it daily with my sonic face brush. It preps your skin well for applications of vitamin C and your regimen.</li>
            <li> I have been using Murad skincare face products for about 5 years now. Of course, in between that time i switch to other skincare as the skin i find tends to become used to the same product after a while and therefore do not produce noticeable results. Anyway, I am 30 years old, combo. skin type and generally clear skin. I found my skin started looking a bit dull, breakouts in certain areas, I needed a good exfoliator. I ordered this product, delivery was fast and this product like all the other murad products i have used thus far is no disappointment. After the very first use, my skin felt different, it also felt tingly during the use. The next morning, my skin looked cleaner, clearer, brighter and definately more polished. Now, as mentioned before, that was after the very first use. I use this three  times per week and the results are great. In between, I use the murad clarifying cleanser and toner and its a fabulous combo. If your skin is a bit dull, even if you do not suffer with acne but get a little breakout or even clogged pores from wearing makeup an so on, try it!!!!!!!!!!!! I highly recommend this product. You will enjoy the benefits.</li>
            <li> Hands down the best face wash. I use this and the murad C-essential cleanser. This is my pm wash and I love how smooth my face feels after I wash with it. It preps my skin for the rest of my pm treatments.</li>
            <li> I love this product. First time using the Murad line. It leaves my skin smooth and soft. I use it 2-3 times a week, or less.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because they use Murad products at Massage Envy where I go for my facials, and it is such a great product. Since the beginning of my use (three months ago), it has cleared up my skin beautifully! My skin feels so soft and I look years younger. I&#x27;m 32 and was not taking care of my skin as I should a year ago and I noticed I was starting to get slight crows feet. Now they&#x27;re all gone. I reversed the aging process at least a couple of years using the Murad products. They&#x27;re so gentle on your skin as well. I also use the Environmental Shield SPF 50. I love it also! Great stuff!</li>
            <li> I LOVE THE MURAD LINE. THIS PRODUCT IS AMAZING ON MY SKIN. HELPS IT STAY CLEAR, SOFT, REINVIGORATED, AND HEALTHY. I USE IT  TWICE DAILY WITH MY OLAY PROx FACIAL CLEANSING BRUSH AND MY SKIN HAS NEVER LOOKED BETTER. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.</li>
            <li> I just did a couple of TCA 30% acid peels and they did wonders for erasing fine lines and hyper-pigmentation from my face as well as brightening.  I want to keep my skin free from anything returning (soon), so I purchased this cleanser and wow... my skin continues to improve.  I will say though that I found a 16.9 fl oz professional size at another site for $35... I will continue to use and alternate between this product and another higher strength glycolic (11%) cleanser.  If you&#x27;re just starting a facial regime and don&#x27;t know where to start, I believe after you do some research, you will find that glycolic, lactic, &amp; salicylic acids work great and give better results when utilized together - so this product delivers that.  i just wished the product listed the % of each acid.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t think it contains all that much aha/bha. Not as harsh as other products I&#x27;ve tried. I am still not acne free but this does well controlling oil. I can&#x27;t comment on the conjunction of different murad products. But cleanser itself is great too.</li>
            <li> have been using it for years!  great delivery right to your door.  lasts a long time and keeps your face so so soft.</li>
            <li> This product was recommended to me after having a facial done at massage envy, I love how smooth this makes my face feel, i&#x27;m currently using it 4x a week.</li>
            <li> I find this as the BEST facial cleanser I have ever used. Not for everyday, but it really keeps my face clean and soft. A+ in my book.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for about 8 years. I was looking for an unscented facial scrub and while it is expensive...it is worth every penny. I haven&#x27;t had any skin issues (dry or oily) since using this product. Love it!</li>
            <li> Gentle exfoliation if properly used.  Skin glows after use daily.  Not for makeup removal, but great for dead skin removal.</li>
            <li> First ingredient is Sodium Laureth Sulfate (after water)!  I avoid this stuff like the plague. I used Murad products 20 years ago, and was very happy with them, but this revelation disappoints me. Studies call SLS a \\&quot;very corrosive irritant to the skin\\&quot;.  It is said that it \\&quot;exerts its damage by stripping your skin of protective oils and moisture\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;  I make sure to avoid it in my shampoo, and I wouldn&#x27;t have purchased this if I had seen it in a list of ingredients for this cleanser. I will still try it because of Murad&#x27;s reputation, but will quit immediately if I start getting irritated skin.</li>
            <li> It exfoliates very well. I am not crazy for the &amp;#34;milky&amp;#34; feel. It&#x27;s almost sticky.</li>
            <li> I use this 2-3 times a week. I love it. When I first got it, the product said that it was a daily cleanser, but when I used it everyday, it made my skin very dry. I would not recommend to use it everyday as it says. Two to three times a week is good enough. I basically use it every third day. Personally, I don&#x27;t use any other cleansers on the other day, so I may have a different experience than others. It feels like nothing when I scrub my skin with it, it&#x27;s like a slippery gel with little beads in it. Be careful to not rub over your eyes with it, try to avoid your eyes, because the beads can get into your eye. I experienced that a lot at first, but not anymore now. I squeeze a small amount into my palm after I wet my hands, and lather it. It gets a little bubbly, then I massage it all over my face and neck, avoiding my eyes of course. I concentrate it on the areas where I have marks or texture. It doesn&#x27;t feel like much, and it&#x27;s not apparently abrasive. It&#x27;s definitely different from sugar scrubs, etc. It is a chemical exfoliant, which I personally think shows more results. I do this for several minutes. Then, I wash it off, with my eye closed, to avoid getting the beads in my eye. I rinse several times. I continue on with my skin care regimen: toner, serum, light moisturizer. When I wake up the next day, my skin is very noticeably brighter, marks have faded slightly. After several weeks of using, my skin is noticeably smoother, light marks are really light, and face is just brighter in general. I also noticed that a lot of blackheads on my chin disappeared after a while. But I don&#x27;t credit all this improvement to this exfoliator, because I also use other products for the same purpose. It should be used sparingly, but diligently. The chemical exfoliator is the alpha hydroxy acids and beta hydroxy acids, like lactic acid and salicylic acid, which just gets rid of skin cells on top chemically, which is better than scrubs which can be more harmful and irritating. This does a great job. I would definitely repurchase this in the future. It really is my favorite exfoliator.</li>
            <li> Murad&#x27;s AHA/BHA Exfoliating Cleanser has a very fine-grit, yet creamy texture &amp; it leaves my skin smooth &amp; soft. I&#x27;m 28 &amp; have started focusing on anti-aging regimens, so this product fits in nicely &amp; I&#x27;m sure that with extended use, I&#x27;ll see better results. I alternate it 2-3x/week with Murad&#x27;s Acne Time-release Cleanser for my very problematic skin &amp; it seems to do a nice job. While I&#x27;d recommend it to others, I wouldn&#x27;t view it as a magical &#x27;cure-all.&#x27; My favorite part about this purchase is still the fact that I got it much cheaper than retail.</li>
            <li> It irritated my skin and I&#x27;m pretty tough. My favorite Murad cleanser is still the Vitamin C one.</li>
            <li> Seems to really help clean up my face and also seems to have some benefit for razor bumps (though that is not a noted use as far as I know). Also leaves skin feeling nice and smooth afterwards.</li>
            <li> I love all of the Murad products, especially as I am 45 years old and am experiencing some adult acne issues.  This works without being too harsh.  I use it every evening and follow with anti aging serum.</li>
            <li> Dr. Murad&#x27;s Exfoliating Cleanser was recommended to me by a skin specialist.  I was worried it was going to be like a lot of \\&quot;gentle\\&quot; exfoliators:  greasy with hardly any grit to polish the skin.  Boy was I wrong.  It is gentle yet also incredibly effective and not greasy at all.      I&#x27;ve had better results with this product than with professional chemical peels.  When I don&#x27;t use this cleanser for a couple of weeks, my skin looks dull, a little bit oily, and my pores sadly open up to the world for all to see.  After I use it, my skin looks clean, polished, even-toned, and my pores are minimized after just one use.     This is a permanent feature in my skin-care regiment and I love it!</li>
            <li> Best face wash for sensitive acne prone skin. I&#x27;ll never use anything else. Works instantly.</li>
            <li> very  mild cleanser - I like it a lot . I think it is one of the best cleansers around</li>
            <li> LOVE IT&lt;br /&gt;It helps with dry patches it got rid of it in two days!!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a soft exfoliant and you might feel like it doesn&#x27;t do much but man does it ever</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to Murad and bought this to help clean my face and fight blackheads and the occasional blemish.  So far, I&#x27;ve been very pleased.  I alternate between this one and the Reform foam.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The microbeads are very small so you don&#x27;t feel like you&#x27;re taking your skin down to the bone.  It&#x27;s gentle enough on my sensitive skin that I use it every other day with no irritation.  My skin is oily and I find that if I exfoliate too often it makes it more oily.  So my routine seems to be working for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product to a friend as it does what it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
            <li> I have been using Murad products for about 10yrs and at 47 many think I am 25 or 30yrs old but I get more in the 20&#x27;s comment. Its amazing what this and all Murad products will deliver results.</li>
            <li> Used only 3 times a week and my skin looks amazing!!! At 32, I am told pretty regularly that I look like I&#x27;m 27!!</li>
            <li> Wow I can&#x27;t believe how well this product works! I was a bit skeptical, but I have dry skin and I noticed an improvement the first day. This is definitely going to be a staple in my beauty regime.</li>
            <li> this stuff makes my skin feel fabulous; clean, soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> I had three areas on my face that were constantly dry and peeling and as I aged the pores on my nose and chin got larger and more problematic. I have always used good products for my skin care but couldn&#x27;t find a satisfactory exfoliator. I decided to try Murad because of the good reviews I read on Amazon. I am so glad I did, because eventhough I have dry skin, I can use this product at bathtime and it works wonders. My pores are smaller and skin is clear but not overly dry. I moisturize with a rich hydrant and am much more pleased with my skin. I would recommend this product to anyone. We women need to exfoliate at least three times a week. Thanks Amazon for good products and helpful reviews.</li>
            <li> I like the size and the container&lt;br /&gt;It is not too much grit so my face does not feel raw after using it</li>
            <li> This is a nice daily cleanser with gentle exfoliation, not too gritty or tough for my aging skin.  A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I have been use this one almost 2 year. My skin looks 10 year younger than actual age.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I live in Seattle wa, during winter time my skin gets very dry. This product works amazing if you exfoliate 3 times a week and on the other days you use a quality face soap ( I use a loccitane soap).... The beads are small but perfect enough to exfoliate without scratching my face. I will definitely continue using this product.</li>
            <li> I used this cleanser on the recommendation of my stylist at the salon where I go.  I told her I have very sensitive, cominbation skin, and was having a hard time finding something that worked for my face.  After several uses, my skin burned each time I used this product.  And after washing, my face was red and splotchy.  Note:  The directions on the back do say to use this only a few times, a week, so that is my bad.  However, even after cutting back on the usage, it still made my skin burn.  My face now feels leathery and dry.  I have stopped using it.  My stylist mentioned that I may have ultra sensitivity to glycolic acid, which is an ingredient.  Disappointed I spent so much on it and it did not work.  The hunt for a new facial cleanser continues.</li>
            <li> I love this cleanser.  I&#x27;m 41 and my skin has gone all wonky the last couple of years.  I&#x27;ve always had super sensitive skin so I haven&#x27;t been able to use much of anything on it without breaking out.  Happy to say, this stuff is awesome and doesn&#x27;t make me break out.  My skin is so soft after using this.  Worth the money!</li>
            <li> I love this product! I use it every night as my nightly routine before I go to bed. I have sensitive, oily, acne prone skin but this has controlled the oil (my skin doesn&#x27;t seem as oily as before). I haven&#x27;t had any bad reaction to it despite my sensitive skin. It exfoliates/ cleans face nicely as well. Totally reccomend!</li>
            <li> This works wonders on my oily, clogged pore prone skin. I alternate between this and the creamy cleanser. little beads do a nice job of exfoliating.</li>
            <li> Like this product and all it other companion products for your face, I do feel a difference after using this cleansing cream.</li>
            <li> I love it, my face was brighter, it really removes the dead skin, great product</li>
            <li> This has little granules in a creamy lotion that foams up nicely. It seems to exfoliate without drying my dehydrated skin. Feels very clean afterwards.</li>
            <li> Despite what some say, the product line is consistently good and delivers on it&#x27;s promise. I wish I could use this exfoliator everyday because each time I use it, my skin glows.</li>
            <li> This is hands down my fave exfoliating cleanser. It&#x27;s gentle and it lasts a long time. It&#x27;s not pricey if you plan on spending this much money for a product that lasts for about 6-9 months or more. A little goes a long way! It&#x27;s an investment not just a purchase!!</li>
            <li> This is great. I use a couple times per week and my face looks great. I&#x27;ve been using this product for over a year and I have no complaints. The number of pimples has reduced significantly and I love the way my skin looks. Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  I have very sensitive skin yet it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin in the slightest.  The product also really works and leaves my face feeling smooth and looking fresh.  My bottle lasted me for over a year used every week or so.</li>
            <li> The &#x27;dots&#x27; on the bottom really bother me.  So, I so not enjoy wearing them.</li>
            <li> I have acne and this is one of my favorite washes and one of the better methods of controlling my blemishes even though it&#x27;s technically an anti aging wash</li>
            <li> This product is really good for exfoliating and giving your skin a nice glow. What I really love about it is that it is not harsh so it won&#x27;t irritate your skin, nor does it feel like you&#x27;re scraping your skin off when you scrub. Don&#x27;t let the price discourage you-- it&#x27;s worth it. You don&#x27;t need to use much and it lasts a long time- I just ran out after 4 mos. This is definitely a staple in my beauty regimen!</li>
            <li> Love this product, my skin feels great after washing my face.</li>
            <li> After only 4 days use my black heads are almost gone and my pores smaller. I have tried so many products and was skeptical of this but its amazing. Cant wait to see how my face looks in a week. I have very combination skill. Its dehydrated yet oily in my nose crease and chin. This leaves my face hydrated.  I might try their moisturizer next&lt;br /&gt;though really do like PCA collagen hydrator.</li>
            <li> Love it! Works great and fast shipment!</li>
            <li> Best exfoiliating face wash I&#x27;ve tried! It really primes your skin for moisturizers or treatments. I use it at least 3 times a week with my Murad Vitamin C Daily Cleanser. They are the best face cleansers on the market. My skin always looks great after using. I will definitely buy it again!</li>
            <li> I love this cleanser!  It is creamy, gentle and has very fine exfoliating beads that dissolve easily.  I use it on my face for a gentle exfoliation and this may sound crazy, but I use it also on my bikini area to prevent ingrown hairs from waxing.  If you look at the ingredients, they are the same used in the popular ingrown hair serums (BHA, AHA and lactic acid).  The combination of this cleanser and a good ingrown hair treatment has kept me smooth.  Like I said, this product is an amazing multi tasker and I highly recommend it.  Plus you can find great deals for it on Amazon.  I got $10 off of what the original price would be.</li>
            <li> great product, great price.  Lasts long, using daily over 2 months with more than half left.  A massage chain charged me 2x the price, returned when I received this one.</li>
            <li> It was on my Christmas List and Amazon had the best price.  This is my second tube of the cleanser, and I can&#x27;t imagine switching to anything else.</li>
            <li> This cleanser was shipped in a few days of its order and it works very nicely for daily cleansing regime.</li>
            <li> Each time I used it I broke out in red whitehead-like pimples. I do still use it on my hands and body in the shower as it is a good exfoliator but will not order it again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 37 years old and this product has lightened the sun spots and acne scars on my face.  It&#x27;s gentle yet contains scrubbing exfolliants, lathers well, lasts a long time.  With my sensitive skin, I always worry that a new product will make me break out, but this didn&#x27;t.  I use this in combo with Murad Resurgence Daily cleanser.</li>
            <li> Great product in a travel size.  Can be used every day without overly drying your face.  Good companion to larger size of this product.</li>
            <li> Great cleanser! I use it every morning and it makes my skin feel very good! I would highly recommend it. It&#x27;s not harsh on the skin.</li>
            <li> Correct item. Received on time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an okay product. I thought my skin would look clearer and that it would help with my blemishes but it doesn&#x27;t do too much plus it is kinda drying to my skin. I do feel my skin is smoother right after washing but its no miracle wash. I use another product and not feel a loss for replacing this one. Like I said its just okay.</li>
            <li> MURAD is on the expensive side as far as facial products but well worth every penny. This bottle will last me 8 months and I use it everyday. If you have dry skin you won&#x27;t need to use it everyday so it will last even longer.</li>
            <li> This product was recommended to me when I had a facial at Massage Envy. I was very skeptical at first since I have oily skin, which breaks out, and frequently have clogged pores. I was sure this would irritate it and would make my skin break out even worse. I was completely wrong. My skin feels so soft and smooth. It has cleared up and looks better than when I was using the Murad Anti-Aging Acne skin line.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend trying it, particularly if you are like me: a middle aged woman with oily skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this cleaner for over 4 years now and it&#x27;s the only thing that doesn&#x27;t irritate my face or dry it out. LOVE this product. Wish the moisturizers were a bit cheaper so I could afford them to go with it!</li>
            <li> Great for old broad&#x27;s skin being 84 years young.</li>
            <li> Easily the best exfoliator I&#x27;ve ever used! I&#x27;ve tried a number of exfoliators from different lines and none of them can compare to this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this for about two months, every other night, and my face is just glowing! The product eliminates any little dry flakes, dirt, oils, and overall leaves my face incredibly clean and fresh. There is ZERO stinging and actually feels somewhat soothing when applied. My face does feel slightly tight after product use, but I always follow up with a moisturizer (including the nights I don&#x27;t use the Exfoliator). Has definitely reduced my acne, brighten my complexion, and causes zero irritation of any kind.</li>
            <li> saved a lot of money by buying through Amazon instead of the spa</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t write reviews but I had to for this product. I have only used it a couple of times but each time I have, my skin is so smooth after. My mom recommended Murad products to me and I can see why. This is an amazing cleanser/exfoliator at an amazing price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Murad products for years.  This is a great Exfoilator.  Nice pleasant smell and not rough on your skin.  I use it every few days and always like how my skin looks and feels.  I like that its a flip top, squeeze bottle.  A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> To start: I am 23 and have sensitive but oily, congested skin and already have some fine lines on my forehead, I also have some freckles/sun damage. I was drawn to this product because of my rough, clogged skin, fine lines and sun damage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Just from reading the information on the tube I can tell this is a great exfoliating product: it packs a threefold punch with Alpha Hydroxy Acids, Beta Hydroxy Acid and exfoliating texture beads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The Alpha Hydroxy Acids in this product are Lactic Acid, a gentler chemical exfoliator, and Glycolic Acid, a slightly more aggressive chemical exfoliator. Both of these being AHA&#x27;s, they are hydrophilic and exfoliate the skin from the surface, which is ideal in anti-aging and texture-improving applications.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Beta Hydroxy Acid is salicylic acid, which penetrates the oil in pores and exfoliates them from inside: because of this mode of action BHA is commonly found in acne-treating products but can also help improve texture in congested or oily skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The last method of exfoliation in this product is the very tiny scrubbing beads... some estheticians say that exfoliating textures in products are a no-no as they can irritate the skin and be too \\&quot;sharp\\&quot; and cause microscopic damage to the skin (ie. when crushed walnut shells are used in scrubs). However, the texture in this product is provided by jojoba esters, basically tiny little beads of the wax-oil jojoba (dont&#x27;t worry, it&#x27;s not in its oil form). These are smoother than some other texture ingredients in scrubs and also these exfoliating beads are so small you barely notice them, but hypothetically they help open up the skin to be more receptive to the chemical exfoliator (AHA and BHA).&lt;br /&gt;I have only been using this product for 3 days but I noticed results the very first time I used it. I use it with a soft face cleansing brush, wet my skin and the brush, apply the cleanser to the brush and massage it into my skin in small circles. I especially focus on the areas with big, clogged pores (cheeks, nose, chin). I massage it in for about 5 minutes then rinse off and pat dry. When I am done my skin is a little pink for a bit probably from the brush, and slightly more sensitive to products but only if I use products that normally irritate my skin a little anyway (again, I will mention that my skin is pretty sensitive). When I am finished cleansing with this product my skin is incredibly soft and smooth and has a visibly more even texture, my pores are much smaller and my skin looks \\&quot;tighter\\&quot;. One benefit of using such an exfoliating cleanser is that your skin will more readily absorb treatments; I follow with a salicylic toner and then an oxygenating serum. It&#x27;s also important when you&#x27;re using such an exfoliating product to moisturize afterwards! Aside from the tightening of the pores, the light creases in my forehead are less noticeable, and  effect which I hope will increase over time by using this product regularly. I am also hoping the exfoliation will help diminish my freckles and sun damage along with my daily application of spf 50 sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I love this product and believe it helps with improving texture, fine lines, sun damage (as long as a strict sunscreen regimine is followed while using this product), clogged pores and probably minor scarring as well. This should be the goal of any solid exfoliating product. In my experience it&#x27;s surprisingly safe for sensitive skin. However I would avoid exfoliation  (especially chemical exfoliation as in this product) if your skin is extremely sensitive and/or irritated by other products or treatments.</li>
            <li> Awesome price at $22. Cleanser arrived sealed and securely packed. I usually pay $35 for this at Sephora. Nice to save some money on my favorite exfoliating cleanser.</li>
            <li> This makes my skin look and feel great.  I am not personally able to use it everyday though.  I use it twice a week and use something a little more gentle the other days.</li>
            <li> Good product, great price?</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful exfoliating cleanser. I use it 3-4 times a week and have been very happy with the results. I have sensitive, acne-prone skin and this hasn&#x27;t caused dry spots or breakouts. It feels amazing to use too!</li>
            <li> Whata amazing clean and fresh sensation, this product is top-notch!&lt;br /&gt;I bought one for me and used with Clarisonic, I can say with 100% certainty that my skin never looked so good!&lt;br /&gt;All my nose dark spots vanished and now my skin tone is extremely even!&lt;br /&gt;Everybody that tested mine, just bought one afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;All without mention that this product will last at least 2 months using almost every day!</li>
            <li> It is very good you will feel your face reborn after using it. But the only thing you have to be careful is not getting a Dry face after using. Other wise i will recommend it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this because I read good reviews on other sites about it&#x27;s ability to fade acne redness and dark marks due to it&#x27;s BHA/AHA ingredients.  In terms of fading my acne scars I can&#x27;t really tell a significant difference after 2 weeks of using it three  times a week. I was expecting a more intense experience, it is actually a very gentle clenser, has a very fine &amp;#34;grit&amp;#34; when it comes to the scrub aspect and is on the creamier side. I have oil-dry combination, acne prone skin. I usually have at least one break out on my face so I was really hoping this would do more to combat that. Since using it i&#x27;ve noticed my skin is softer, but  if I don&#x27;t follow up with a acne treatment gel I break out more then usual the next day. I followed up with a basic  acne moisturizer and SPF but it still makes my cheeks dry and other areas like my nose more oily then normal. Perhaps if you used a Murad serum or moisturizer it would work better? Either way, if you have oily skin I would stick to a drugstore exfoliator or Dermalogica and save yourself the high pricetag of this Exfoliator/Cleanser. On the plus side though, the bottle is huge and would definitely last the average person several months of use!</li>
            <li> Got to use this product coz I don&#x27;t wanna waste the money I paid for the product. Don&#x27;t see any changes at all. Will never buy expensive produtct anymore, guess will stick to my cheape one!</li>
            <li> This is the best facial cleanser out there... The exfoliating beads are really really tiny, almost microscopic, so they they deep into the pores and clean them out effectively but gently. Not as obnoxious to use as some other products with large exfoliating beads. Expensive, yes, but worth it.</li>
