            <li>Very good product,wife loves it and uses some on the dogs also.</li>
            <li>And best of all, it works great for oily hair.</li>
            <li>it has shine, volumn &amp; smells beautiful.</li>
            <li>One pump is the perfect amount for my hair, and it seems to do a fairly good job of adding volume.</li>
            <li>my hair looks great</li>
            <li>Great for curly hair.</li>
            <li>This makes me smell great</li>
            <li>and it does a great job.  </li>
            <li>Great strawberry aroma.  </li>
            <li>Shipoos look great after use.</li>
            <li>A top notch product!!</li>
            <li>One word, amazing!</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo its wonderful</li>
            <li>Nothing spectacular, but I&#x27;ve never found a shampoo that is!</li>
            <li>SMELLS REALLY GOOD</li>
            <li>Good shampoo.</li>
            <li>I love the fragrance, but even more than that, it is the best volumizing shampoo I have found.</li>
            <li>Love this shampoo been using it for years!</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo!</li>
            <li>AND YOUR HAIR FEELS REALLY NICE</li>
            <li>The pump is so handy in the shower.  </li>
            <li>The smell is so strong and it smells like strawberry!</li>
            <li>More importantly, bed head doesn&#x27;t test on animals which makes it even more appealing!</li>
            <li>Could just be a one time thing but as a paying customer I would expect my items to be packaged better.</li>
            <li>I loved the smells and fun bottle colors and designs.</li>
            <li>It is her favorite shampoo and that says a lot for a woman who switches shampoos, hairsprays, and things like this faster than The Flash can stand up.</li>
            <li>Let&#x27;s see how it works after a couple more uses.  </li>
            <li>I use the coordinating  conditioner too and love it.</li>
            <li>It now sits in my guest bathroom available to friends and family who visit !</li>
            <li>I also noticed that about 1 month after use my hair felt and looked like it had more volume.</li>
            <li>My absolute favorite shampoo and conditioner duo!!</li>
            <li>The smell was great according to my 9 year old niece, and had I been her age</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like the strawberry smell that it is too strong</li>
            <li>I have fine wavy hair of medium thickness that gets oily very quickly.</li>
            <li>I like the shampoo just fine</li>
            <li>Huge bottle.</li>
            <li>During that time I used the sulfate free &amp;#34; superstar &amp;#34; I believe it was called so sulfates wouldn&#x27;t damage my extension bond.</li>
            <li>Since then, I purchased Mastey Traite&#x27; Cream Shampoo, which is also sulfate free.  </li>
            <li>, it doesn&#x27;t leave my hair light or clean.</li>
            <li>Love the large bottle.</li>
            <li>My boyfriend is the one who noticed, and he was right!</li>
            <li>I have pretty fine, damaged hair, and the fact that this is sulfate free is a heaven send for my locks.</li>
            <li>Love it - really makes my hair bouncier.</li>
            <li>The price was good and the shampoo is terrific.</li>
            <li>Nice pump action.</li>
            <li>so it is important that I use just the right shampoo.  </li>
            <li>This smells amazing and gives my fine blonde hair some volume!</li>
            <li>This shampoo smells fantastic and lathers really well.  </li>
            <li>For an SLS free shampoo it lathers really well and cleans my hair.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend for anyone looking for a light feel with fullness.</li>
            <li>I am still very pleased by the way it makes my hair feel, makes it clean and soft feeling overall.</li>
            <li>Highly recommending to everyone!!</li>
            <li>and it made my hair so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>I just used this product for the first time yesterday...</li>
            <li>My hair was very obviously fuller and more bouncy than it had been I&#x27;m years.</li>
            <li>I have never found a shampoo that I couldn&#x27;t live without.....until now!!</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t get the volume, and to be honest my hair felt a little &#x27;stripped&#x27; of moisture after using it.</li>
            <li>My boyfriend really likes and uses it as well.</li>
            <li>Paid way too much to be stuck with something I don&#x27;t like.</li>
            <li>Initial thoughts were that it smelled fantastic .. like strawberries.</li>
            <li>I love Tigi products, but this one was a let down.</li>
            <li>The shampoo is made of high quality ingredients.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had a hard time finding sulphate-free shampoos that create a nice lather.</li>
            <li>However, I don&#x27;t really understand why shampoo is called, \\&quot;epic volume.\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>This shampoo is luxuriously thick and lathers up nicely.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used other SLS free shampoos and find that it leaves a residue</li>
            <li>I only use a tiny bit of this shampoo on my scalp (sometimes on my hair to remove coconut oil masks) and it rinses clean.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very thick and goes a long way, and of course has a very rich scent, like a huge bucket of strawberries.</li>
            <li>I purchased this shampoo because I was looking for a sulfate free shampoo that would give my hair a little body.  </li>
            <li>I will keep using Lush&#x27;s Cynthia Sylvia or Lush&#x27;s</li>
            <li>Since I was young my mom used to spoil me with an array of Bed Head products.</li>
            <li>I recommend it with the epic volume conditioner.</li>
            <li>This epic volume works just as well.  </li>
            <li>After one shampoo, my hair was silky and soft.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t believe how good this shampoo is, Gives you lots of volume, does not cause buildup, &amp; it only takes a small amount!!!</li>
            <li>I recommend this product for women who want to steer clear of sulfates and harsh chemicals, and for those who are seeking a little bit more volume over time.</li>
            <li>know I&#x27;ve only used it once so far</li>
            <li>However, I only gave this product four instead of five stars because it doesn&#x27;t create volume as I thought it would for my thin fine hair.</li>

            <li> I have very thin hair and have tried all sorts of products that advertise that they create more volume, this product actually works.</li>
            <li> I have long, coarse (color-treated ) hair</li>
            <li> It has also restored my hair back to its health that I dont even need to blow dry or treat it</li>
            <li> (I have soft slightly wavy hair</li>
            <li> It smells heavenly and the shampoo itself is wonderfully thick and you can really feel it in your roots.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone who wants/needs extra volume without the sulfates of other shampoos.  </li>
            <li> I have thick long hair that can get pretty heavy, but this makes it behave well and feel bouncy.</li>
            <li> and while some were semi-effective, this is the ONLY product that has stopped my hair from falling (not sure if its because its sulfate-free or some other reason)</li>
            <li> Due to the heaviness of my hair, I need something for volume in order not to be weighted down, and I also need a sulfate-free shampoo.  </li>
            <li> I usually buy it in my salon but figured I would order it from Amazon to save myself a little money and extra trip to the salon.</li>
            <li> However my problem is when I received it the lid was unscrewed and over half of my shampoo was dumped all over the container and box.</li>
            <li> but I wouldn&#x27;t say it was anything out of the ordinary from other volumizing shampoos.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This shampoo dried out my hair so that it looked like straw, even though I have a Brazilian Blowout treatment.  </li>
            <li> I gave it a 5 star because I don&#x27;t think you can ever go wrong with any Bed Head item, especially this shampoo.</li>
            <li> No more words to describe.</li>
            <li> Furthermore, I was not able to return this product.  </li>
            <li> A little bit of it spilled, not much at all, but still this shampoo is expensive and the lid should be screwed on tighter.</li>
            <li> Around 5 years ago I cut and donated my long hair, and ended up getting expensive extensions put in.</li>
            <li> and it is too thick</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found that this shampoo tricks people into thinking I have thick hair.</li>
            <li> I have used other BED HEAD products before and have never been disappointed.  </li>
            <li> If it will work on my difficult hair, it should work on everyone!</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Love it - really makes my hair bouncier.</li>
            <li> I like the shampoo just fine I usually buy it in my salon but figured I would order it from Amazon to save myself a little money and extra trip to the salon. However my problem is when I received it the lid was unscrewed and over half of my shampoo was dumped all over the container and box. Could just be a one time thing but as a paying customer I would expect my items to be packaged better.</li>
            <li> The shampoo is made of high quality ingredients.  More importantly, bed head doesn&#x27;t test on animals which makes it even more appealing! However, I don&#x27;t really understand why shampoo is called, \\&quot;epic volume.\\&quot;. It smells heavenly and the shampoo itself is wonderfully thick and you can really feel it in your roots.

            <li> Love this shampoo been using it for years!</li>
            <li> Love the large bottle.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo its wonderful my hair looks great it has shine, volumn &amp; smells beautiful.</li>
            <li> This smells amazing and gives my fine blonde hair some volume! Not a ton, but definitely noticeable. My boyfriend really likes and uses it as well.</li>
            <li> It was not for me. I don&#x27;t like the strawberry smell that it is too strong, it doesn&#x27;t leave my hair light or clean. I will keep using Lush&#x27;s Cynthia Sylvia or Lush&#x27;s Big for a lighter, healthier hair and scalp.</li>
            <li> I have never found a shampoo that I couldn&#x27;t live without.....until now!! Can&#x27;t believe how good this shampoo is, Gives you lots of volume, does not cause buildup, &amp; it only takes a small amount!!! Highly recommending to everyone!!</li>
            <li> I AM A BED HEAD FAN.  SMELLS REALLY GOOD AND YOUR HAIR FEELS REALLY NICE WHEN YOU USE THIS.  I RECOMMEND IT .</li>
            <li> Since I was young my mom used to spoil me with an array of Bed Head products. I loved the smells and fun bottle colors and designs. I have thick long hair that can get pretty heavy, but this makes it behave well and feel bouncy. Around 5 years ago I cut and donated my long hair, and ended up getting expensive extensions put in. During that time I used the sulfate free &amp;#34; superstar &amp;#34; I believe it was called so sulfates wouldn&#x27;t damage my extension bond. I believe this is a newer/updated version of that plus the &amp;#34;style shot &amp;#34;. I am still very pleased by the way it makes my hair feel, makes it clean and soft feeling overall. It&#x27;s very thick and goes a long way, and of course has a very rich scent, like a huge bucket of strawberries. I gave it a 5 star because I don&#x27;t think you can ever go wrong with any Bed Head item, especially this shampoo.</li>
            <li> I have used this shampoo for 8 years. Excellent shampoo. Does not damage color treated hair or rinse out color. Great for curly hair.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this. It is her favorite shampoo and that says a lot for a woman who switches shampoos, hairsprays, and things like this faster than The Flash can stand up.</li>
            <li> This shampoo smells fantastic and lathers really well.  The pump is so handy in the shower.  I like the shampoo because it doesn&#x27;t contain sulfates or parabens.</li>
            <li> This one is the best shampoo in the world EVER! I do recommend for everyone.  No more words to describe.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the smell and it is too thick and I can&#x27;t exchange from this seller.....Paid way too much to be stuck with something I don&#x27;t like.</li>
            <li> I started using this when it was called \\&quot;Superstar.\\&quot; I was concerned when they switched the name but thankfully the ingredients haven&#x27;t changed. I only use a tiny bit of this shampoo on my scalp (sometimes on my hair to remove coconut oil masks) and it rinses clean. I have fine wavy hair of medium thickness that gets oily very quickly. I&#x27;ve found that this shampoo tricks people into thinking I have thick hair.</li>
            <li> A little bit of it spilled, not much at all, but still this shampoo is expensive and the lid should be screwed on tighter. The smell is so strong and it smells like strawberry! 4 stars as of now because I haven&#x27;t used it yet.  Edit:  Just used it and it made my hair so soft and smooth. Let&#x27;s see how it works after a couple more uses.  Edit: 1/9/12  One word, amazing!</li>
            <li> For years my hair has been falling out (various reasons: medication, salty water, straightening / dying, etc.) and I have tried all sorts of remedies (various shampoos from salons, vitamins, oils, etc.) and while some were semi-effective, this is the ONLY product that has stopped my hair from falling (not sure if its because its sulfate-free or some other reason) but since then it has been the only shampoo that I use. It has also restored my hair back to its health that I dont even need to blow dry or treat it (I have soft slightly wavy hair but it can get frizzy, esp in the humid climate in my country). I recommend it with the epic volume conditioner.</li>
            <li> This makes me smell great and it does a great job.  I use the coordinating  conditioner too and love it.</li>
            <li> The price was good and the shampoo is terrific. Great strawberry aroma.  My son and daughter-inlaw are going to purchase it also.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a hard time finding sulphate-free shampoos that create a nice lather. This shampoo is luxuriously thick and lathers up nicely. One pump is the perfect amount for my hair, and it seems to do a fairly good job of adding volume. Nothing spectacular, but I&#x27;ve never found a shampoo that is! I&#x27;ll definitely order this again.</li>
            <li> I have been buying the bedhead superstar for volume for years.  This epic volume works just as well.  I have tried others &amp; bedhead is the best.</li>
            <li> I have long, coarse (color-treated ) hair so it is important that I use just the right shampoo.  Due to the heaviness of my hair, I need something for volume in order not to be weighted down, and I also need a sulfate-free shampoo.  I have used other BED HEAD products before and have never been disappointed.  I would recommend this product to anyone who wants/needs extra volume without the sulfates of other shampoos.  If it will work on my difficult hair, it should work on everyone!</li>
            <li> I purchased this shampoo because I was looking for a sulfate free shampoo that would give my hair a little body.  This shampoo dried out my hair so that it looked like straw, even though I have a Brazilian Blowout treatment.  Furthermore, I was not able to return this product.  So now I am stuck with it or I must toss it and be out over $20.  Since then, I purchased Mastey Traite&#x27; Cream Shampoo, which is also sulfate free.  After one shampoo, my hair was silky and soft.  I wish I had found Mastey Traite&#x27; Cream Shampoo before I bought this stuff.</li>
            <li> I just used this product for the first time yesterday... Initial thoughts were that it smelled fantastic .. like strawberries. For an SLS free shampoo it lathers really well and cleans my hair.  I&#x27;ve used other SLS free shampoos and find that it leaves a residue and my gets oily by the end of the day,&lt;br /&gt;As for the &amp;#34;epic volume&amp;#34; my hair definitely had a bit of a volume boost but I wouldn&#x27;t say it was anything out of the ordinary from other volumizing shampoos.&lt;br /&gt;I know I&#x27;ve only used it once so far but I think I&#x27;ll definitely purchase this again!</li>
            <li> I love Tigi products, but this one was a let down. The smell was great according to my 9 year old niece, and had I been her age I would have agreed! Didn&#x27;t get the volume, and to be honest my hair felt a little &#x27;stripped&#x27; of moisture after using it. It now sits in my guest bathroom available to friends and family who visit !</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo! And the convenient dispenser it comes in. I love the fragrance, but even more than that, it is the best volumizing shampoo I have found.</li>
            <li> Very good product,wife loves it and uses some on the dogs also.Shipoos look great after use. HA</li>
            <li> My absolute favorite shampoo and conditioner duo!! I have pretty fine, damaged hair, and the fact that this is sulfate free is a heaven send for my locks. I also noticed that about 1 month after use my hair felt and looked like it had more volume. My boyfriend is the one who noticed, and he was right! My hair was very obviously fuller and more bouncy than it had been I&#x27;m years. I recommend this product for women who want to steer clear of sulfates and harsh chemicals, and for those who are seeking a little bit more volume over time. A top notch product!!</li>
            <li> This is the best volume shampoo on the market.  And best of all, it works great for oily hair. I highly recommend for anyone looking for a light feel with fullness.</li>
            <li> Have been using this shampoo (and the conditioner) for over a year now.... and I won&#x27;t be using anything else ever again.</li>
            <li> Huge bottle. Nice pump action. Can tell a difference in my fine/thin hair - definitely volumizes. No conditioner necessary for me. Bought this and used it all, tried something fancier, went back and bought this again. Good shampoo.</li>
            <li> I have very thin hair and have tried all sorts of products that advertise that they create more volume, this product actually works. I will never use anything else!</li>
