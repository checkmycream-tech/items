            <li>I never knew that coco oil could be so good and versatile.</li>

            <li>I use it every day, leave my feeling good</li>
            <li>Wish the bottle did not come full to the brim!!!  </li>
            <li>excellent coconut oil - you can even tale it by the spoon full</li>
            <li>As advertised, a great oil for massage - not so oily, yet still very smooth.</li>
            <li>Cheaper than most but great quality.  </li>
            <li>But I am sure it will work great for me when I do.</li>
            <li>I use this odorless, great textured product on many of my clients.</li>
            <li>With a flip-top dispenser of some sort this would be perfect and well worth a 5-star review.</li>
            <li>Am very pleased with it.  </li>
            <li>Superior product, fast shipping, and great price!!!</li>

            <li>I love this oil!</li>
            <li>So soothing and makes your skin feel wonderful love love love</li>
            <li>I love it! </li>
            <li>This is a great and light oil.</li>
            <li>It has no scent of its own so adding fragrance was not a problem</li>
            <li>The delivery was fast and the bottle was wrapped perfect.</li>
            <li>I really liked the feel of the product, but I the price point is not cost effective for my massage business.  </li>
            <li>We use this to moisturize our faces after spritzing with rose water and it keeps our faces hydrated throughout the day without feeling or looking oily.</li>
            <li>I use this soap to make my own cleaner for furniture.  </li>
            <li>Nice quality.</li>
            <li>It absorbs into my skin nicely and does not leave a greasy feeling afterward.</li>
            <li>Absolutely loving this product.</li>
            <li>I am amazed and impressed that no matter the weather conditions (unusual winter here in Calif. temps at night getting to 40&#x27;s, 30&#x27;s and now below freezing levels of 28 degrees) inflicted on this product, it stays liquified.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I will def purchase this again from Dr. Adorable, and I love the name too!</li>
            <li>I am happy with this product and would recommend it to other oil users and the price was great!</li>
            <li>and I really love the light weight of coconut oil and how nicely it soaks into skin while still leaving a good glide.  </li>
            <li>good product, good price, fast shipping</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s perfect since it&#x27;s all natural &amp; unscented :)</li>
            <li>It was shipped quickly and seems to be a good quality oil.</li>
            <li>I love it and the fact that it has no scent</li>
            <li>This product by Dr. Adorable is perfect for my needs and affordable at the same time!</li>
            <li>Love this oil.</li>
            <li>In fact I think it has helped her skin to keep a healthy glow.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a slightly more viscous than the DoTerra brand...</li>
            <li>so I thought I&#x27;d try Dr. Adorable&#x27;s...</li>
            <li>This is a versatile product and has many uses.  </li>
            <li>It is perfect to mix with essential oils.</li>
            <li>It is the perfect carrier oil for many of my favorite essential oil blends.  </li>
            <li>Thank you Dr. Adorable.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m quite pleased with the results.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Just love this oil:)</li>
            <li>Perfect for making soap and body washes and diluting essential oils</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>My favorite lotion is cetaphil</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>This oil is perfect as a carrier for my therapeutic oils and gets used daily.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Order two or more at a time to save shipping.</li>
            <li>I really love it.  </li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>I use a lot of therapeutic essential oils and this coconut oil is perfect as a carrier oil.</li>
            <li>How do I love this product?</li>
            <li>Great product and delivered fast</li>
            <li>The product is a nice scent free and lightweight oil</li>
            <li>I love the oil.  </li>
            <li>I love this oil.  </li>
            <li>Great light oil that mixes well with everything I have tried it with so far.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s such a great price:).</li>
            <li>/&gt;Application was easy and it disperses well.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>and it easily abosrbed into the skin.</li>
            <li>(I put it in a pump bottle), as it is really full (more for your money, I&#x27;m not complaining.)</li>
            <li>Excellent product...works very very well with essential oil application.</li>
            <li>The oil is fine.</li>
            <li>No scent, light weight and great alone as a moisturizer or combined with essential oils.</li>
            <li>so I can make my own body oil with the scented oils that are coming to me very soon.</li>
            <li>The price was fantastic too.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still on my quest to find the fractionated coconut oil that&#x27;s a fit for my practice.</li>
            <li>Mixed it with almond oil and my bees wax to make a really great hand cream.</li>
            <li>Also, it is great for mixing essential oils.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light, odorless  and non-greasy.</li>
            <li>Overall the product is very nice.  </li>
            <li>What is significant is that I am allergic to skin products that contain petroleum.  </li>
            <li>The oil is light and absorbs quickly into the skin/hair.</li>
            <li>I was really happy with it until I realized after about a week of using it that my skin is dry and itchy.  </li>
            <li>Nice, light, no odor (unlike the Bon Vital version).  </li>
            <li>It works very well-releases dirt and add a beautiful shine at the same time.</li>
            <li>And it shipped fast:).  </li>
            <li>I love it so much~</li>
            <li>any inexpensive lotion will do;&lt;br /&gt;I add it in leave in serums for my hair - it is a most potent weapon against psoriasis;&lt;br /&gt;After showering and toweling off, I smear  a little in my pubic area to keep that area nice and fresh</li>
            <li>I also use it on my hair and love the way it leaves my hair feeling nice and light, not weighted down and greasy.</li>
            <li>Luckily, I ordered the 16oz bottle.  </li>
            <li>I use it for topical application and for cooking and could not be more satisfied.</li>
            <li>local company used to make all my favorite flavors of oil sprays I used in the shower to keep my skin smelling great but more so, soft and not dried out and cracked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>As I continued on my journey to research more on the history and usefulness of essential oils, I couldn&#x27;t believe more people weren&#x27;t using this.</li>
            <li>Absorbs quickly so you don&#x27;t feel to greasy.</li>
            <li>Mixed with an essential oil, or not, this has wonderful glide and moisturizing.</li>
            <li>I now mix it with almost all my body oils and lotions~not only to make them last longer~but because it just feels soooo good on my skin!!!</li>
            <li>I found that my skin feels great for the first couple of hours, but as the day goes on my skin is still dry at the end.  </li>
            <li>Very nice oil to add other oil to.  </li>
            <li>I love this coconut oil: the price is right, it&#x27;s unscented, and keeps my skin soft &amp; smooth.</li>
            <li>The oil is not greasy at all but doesn&#x27;t get absorbed too quickly.</li>
            <li>This blend better with my smoothies, works well with essential oils and is easy to cook with.</li>
            <li>Clear, smooth, rubs into skin easily.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve completely stopped using lotion. :)</li>
            <li>The manufacture tried to prevent this by putting a anti-tamper seal on the bottle and applying a piece of clear tape over the screw top to prevent it from accidentally loosening.  </li>
            <li>This are good ideas, but the bottle is too flimsy and gets crushed during shipping.  </li>
            <li>I add my own essential oils to make a variety of massage and therapeutic oils.  </li>
            <li>Super fast shipping!</li>
            <li>I experienced an allergic reaction causing small blisters and redness to appear on the areas I applied the oil to.  </li>
            <li>I ordered the Organic Pure Fractionated Coconut Oil and it arrived quickly despite a three day ice storm.</li>
            <li>This is better than hard coconut oil that would get stuck in my razor, this gives you a nice close shave without the irritation.</li>
            <li>but if it ever runs out I will certainly purchase this again!</li>
            <li>Product arrived super fast, was double bagged in a bubble wrap postage bag, and the oil has been great at diluting my doTERRA oils for daily use!</li>
            <li>The shipping was SUPER fast too.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it for several weeks now and it works great as a carrier oil for essential oils.  </li>
            <li>It lasts for an entire massage without drying out (and requiring more).</li>
            <li>I recently started using Doterra oils and found that many oils need a carrier oil.  </li>
            <li>You get 3-4 times more oil for the same price as Doterra&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>This is the first coconut oil I have used</li>
            <li>Love it for diluting my essential oils!  </li>
            <li>Love the consistency of this oil and mixing it with my essential oils.  </li>
            <li>Just make sure you put it in a different container</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll definitely be buying more.</li>
            <li>I hesitantly used her samples over the course of two (2) months which I later learned to absolutely love.</li>
            <li>Dr Adorable Inc. I&#x27;ll continue using this product and will definitely recommend to my family and friends.</li>
            <li>I will be back for more.</li>
            <li>No scent, so you can mix with your favorite essential oil.</li>
            <li>The only thing I would change, is to have a squeeze top so the oil doesn&#x27;t come out so fast.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used pure coconut oil as a body lotion for years....</li>
            <li>This oil is so pure it looks like water.  </li>
            <li>It is pure...</li>
            <li>Very high quality product</li>
            <li>I really like this and the large amount you get for the money.</li>
            <li>Overall, this is a great product and does not cost a lot compared to other organic oils!!</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>I really like the feel of this oil.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>much better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It works very well for my home business making body care products.</li>
            <li>This really helps him not to itch and scratch till he bleeds.</li>
            <li>I expected more from this oil.  </li>
            <li>The whole point of buying it fractionated is so that it remains a liquid.</li>
            <li>THE BOTTLE LETS TO MUCH OUT AT A</li>
            <li>THANKS</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast.</li>
            <li>Use this for a lot of different  reasons, the latest being  an all natural bug repellant , it works greaat</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t want to make a mess every time you use it, pour some into a better bottle first.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s many other uses.  </li>
            <li>Not a bad thing, just different!</li>
            <li>It costs less than anywhere else I looked (including some of the big essential oil companies) &amp; is great quality-and a large amount for the price</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is my new found choice for using this at the end of my shower routine and keeping my skin smelling like a REAL COCONUT, healing and keeping it soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks and keep on making it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Enjoy the liquid form, left skin soft</li>
            <li>I  highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I recommend this highly to all oil users.  </li>
            <li>I have decided to use organic products for my skin routine, so this is my new moisturizer at the moment.  </li>
            <li>My oil came in a liquid form, but it was hot outside.</li>
            <li>A co-worker first introduced me to the world of essential oils.</li>
            <li>I use a LOT of Fractionated Coconut Oil but require purity so as not to take away from the benefits of my 100% pure CPTG Essential Oils.  </li>
            <li>I can only conclude that this product may not be 100% pure but has petroleum oil in it.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t clog pores and it works very well as a vehicle for our essential oils as well.</li>
            <li>so far everyone I have applied it on loves it.</li>
            <li>Completely odorless.</li>
            <li>and I was looking for something that&#x27;s natural that does the trick without making my skin feel too greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>As the old adage goes....the proof is in the pudding.</li>
            <li>so you can really smell the essential oils well.  </li>
            <li>The earlier posting about the bottle was VERY helpful.</li>
            <li>You really should have a smaller container of some sort ready when you open this bottle.</li>
            <li>I have since emptied the entire bottle into an empty and clean dish soap bottle to solve the problem.</li>
            <li>It does not sink into the skin as quickly as lotion, which means less reapplication.</li>
            <li>I use it often on my son who has MS and  sometimes has dry skin from certain medications.</li>
            <li>But as I used the oils over the last three months now, I can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li>It helps to stretch my essential oils and makes them last so much longer.</li>
            <li>I like that it is not extremely greasy.</li>
            <li>If I set it down to fast, the oil jumped out of the top of it and splashed, or it ran down the sides after pouring some in my hand when I was careful not to let it spill.</li>
            <li>The oil comes in a clear bottle with simple labeling.</li>
            <li>put the oil on right out of the shower and give it a few minutes to soak in before getting dressed.  </li>
            <li>Least greasy, and absorbs in quickly.</li>
            <li>My husband likes the way it makes his skin feel because his skin is very dry and sensitive.</li>

            <li> I thought this was a good price</li>
            <li> I use it every day, leave my feeling good</li>
            <li> Wish the bottle did not come full to the brim!!!  </li>
            <li> excellent coconut oil - you can even tale it by the spoon full</li>
            <li> As advertised, a great oil for massage - not so oily, yet still very smooth.</li>
            <li> Cheaper than most but great quality.  </li>
            <li> But I am sure it will work great for me when I do.</li>
            <li> I use this odorless, great textured product on many of my clients.</li>
            <li> With a flip-top dispenser of some sort this would be perfect and well worth a 5-star review.</li>
            <li> Am very pleased with it.  </li>
            <li> Superior product, fast shipping, and great price!!!</li>
            <li> Definitely more for your money without lowering the quality!</li>
            <li> I love this oil!</li>
            <li> So soothing and makes your skin feel wonderful love love love</li>
            <li> I love it! </li>
            <li> This is a great and light oil.</li>
            <li> It has no scent of its own so adding fragrance was not a problem</li>
            <li> The delivery was fast and the bottle was wrapped perfect.</li>
            <li> I really liked the feel of the product, but I the price point is not cost effective for my massage business.  </li>
            <li> We use this to moisturize our faces after spritzing with rose water and it keeps our faces hydrated throughout the day without feeling or looking oily.</li>
            <li> I use this soap to make my own cleaner for furniture.  </li>
            <li> Nice quality.</li>
            <li> It absorbs into my skin nicely and does not leave a greasy feeling afterward.</li>
            <li> Absolutely loving this product.</li>
            <li> I am amazed and impressed that no matter the weather conditions (unusual winter here in Calif. temps at night getting to 40&#x27;s, 30&#x27;s and now below freezing levels of 28 degrees) inflicted on this product, it stays liquified.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I will def purchase this again from Dr. Adorable, and I love the name too!</li>
            <li> I am happy with this product and would recommend it to other oil users and the price was great!</li>
            <li> and I really love the light weight of coconut oil and how nicely it soaks into skin while still leaving a good glide.  </li>
            <li> good product, good price, fast shipping</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s perfect since it&#x27;s all natural &amp; unscented :)</li>
            <li> It was shipped quickly and seems to be a good quality oil.</li>
            <li> I love it and the fact that it has no scent</li>
            <li> This product by Dr. Adorable is perfect for my needs and affordable at the same time!</li>
            <li> Love this oil.</li>
            <li> In fact I think it has helped her skin to keep a healthy glow.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a slightly more viscous than the DoTerra brand...</li>
            <li> so I thought I&#x27;d try Dr. Adorable&#x27;s...</li>
            <li> This is a versatile product and has many uses.  </li>
            <li> It is perfect to mix with essential oils.</li>
            <li> It is the perfect carrier oil for many of my favorite essential oil blends.  </li>
            <li> Thank you Dr. Adorable.</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m quite pleased with the results.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Just love this oil:)</li>
            <li> Perfect for making soap and body washes and diluting essential oils</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> My favorite lotion is cetaphil</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> This oil is perfect as a carrier for my therapeutic oils and gets used daily.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Order two or more at a time to save shipping.</li>
            <li> I really love it.  </li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> I use a lot of therapeutic essential oils and this coconut oil is perfect as a carrier oil.</li>
            <li> How do I love this product?</li>
            <li> Great product and delivered fast</li>
            <li> The product is a nice scent free and lightweight oil</li>
            <li> I love the oil.  </li>
            <li> I love this oil.  </li>
            <li> Great light oil that mixes well with everything I have tried it with so far.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s such a great price:).</li>
            <li> /&gt;Application was easy and it disperses well.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> and it easily abosrbed into the skin.</li>
            <li> (I put it in a pump bottle), as it is really full (more for your money, I&#x27;m not complaining.)</li>
            <li> Excellent product...works very very well with essential oil application.</li>
            <li> The oil is fine.</li>
            <li> No scent, light weight and great alone as a moisturizer or combined with essential oils.</li>
            <li> so I can make my own body oil with the scented oils that are coming to me very soon.</li>
            <li> The price was fantastic too.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still on my quest to find the fractionated coconut oil that&#x27;s a fit for my practice.</li>
            <li> Mixed it with almond oil and my bees wax to make a really great hand cream.</li>
            <li> Also, it is great for mixing essential oils.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light, odorless  and non-greasy.</li>
            <li> Overall the product is very nice.  </li>
            <li> What is significant is that I am allergic to skin products that contain petroleum.  </li>
            <li> The oil is light and absorbs quickly into the skin/hair.</li>
            <li> I was really happy with it until I realized after about a week of using it that my skin is dry and itchy.  </li>
            <li> Nice, light, no odor (unlike the Bon Vital version).  </li>
            <li> It works very well-releases dirt and add a beautiful shine at the same time.</li>
            <li> And it shipped fast:).  </li>
            <li> I love it so much~</li>
            <li> any inexpensive lotion will do;&lt;br /&gt;I add it in leave in serums for my hair - it is a most potent weapon against psoriasis;&lt;br /&gt;After showering and toweling off, I smear  a little in my pubic area to keep that area nice and fresh</li>
            <li> I also use it on my hair and love the way it leaves my hair feeling nice and light, not weighted down and greasy.</li>
            <li> Luckily, I ordered the 16oz bottle.  </li>
            <li> I use it for topical application and for cooking and could not be more satisfied.</li>
            <li> local company used to make all my favorite flavors of oil sprays I used in the shower to keep my skin smelling great but more so, soft and not dried out and cracked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> As I continued on my journey to research more on the history and usefulness of essential oils, I couldn&#x27;t believe more people weren&#x27;t using this.</li>
            <li> Absorbs quickly so you don&#x27;t feel to greasy.</li>
            <li> Mixed with an essential oil, or not, this has wonderful glide and moisturizing.</li>
            <li> I now mix it with almost all my body oils and lotions~not only to make them last longer~but because it just feels soooo good on my skin!!!</li>
            <li> I found that my skin feels great for the first couple of hours, but as the day goes on my skin is still dry at the end.  </li>
            <li> Very nice oil to add other oil to.  </li>
            <li> I love this coconut oil: the price is right, it&#x27;s unscented, and keeps my skin soft &amp; smooth.</li>
            <li> The oil is not greasy at all but doesn&#x27;t get absorbed too quickly.</li>
            <li> This blend better with my smoothies, works well with essential oils and is easy to cook with.</li>
            <li> Clear, smooth, rubs into skin easily.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve completely stopped using lotion. :)</li>
            <li> The manufacture tried to prevent this by putting a anti-tamper seal on the bottle and applying a piece of clear tape over the screw top to prevent it from accidentally loosening.  </li>
            <li> This are good ideas, but the bottle is too flimsy and gets crushed during shipping.  </li>
            <li> I add my own essential oils to make a variety of massage and therapeutic oils.  </li>
            <li> Super fast shipping!</li>
            <li> I experienced an allergic reaction causing small blisters and redness to appear on the areas I applied the oil to.  </li>
            <li> I ordered the Organic Pure Fractionated Coconut Oil and it arrived quickly despite a three day ice storm.</li>
            <li> This is better than hard coconut oil that would get stuck in my razor, this gives you a nice close shave without the irritation.</li>
            <li> but if it ever runs out I will certainly purchase this again!</li>
            <li> Product arrived super fast, was double bagged in a bubble wrap postage bag, and the oil has been great at diluting my doTERRA oils for daily use!</li>
            <li> The shipping was SUPER fast too.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for several weeks now and it works great as a carrier oil for essential oils.  </li>
            <li> It lasts for an entire massage without drying out (and requiring more).</li>
            <li> I recently started using Doterra oils and found that many oils need a carrier oil.  </li>
            <li> You get 3-4 times more oil for the same price as Doterra&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> This is the first coconut oil I have used</li>
            <li> Love it for diluting my essential oils!  </li>
            <li> Love the consistency of this oil and mixing it with my essential oils.  </li>
            <li> Just make sure you put it in a different container</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll definitely be buying more.</li>
            <li> I hesitantly used her samples over the course of two (2) months which I later learned to absolutely love.</li>
            <li> Dr Adorable Inc. I&#x27;ll continue using this product and will definitely recommend to my family and friends.</li>
            <li> I will be back for more.</li>
            <li> No scent, so you can mix with your favorite essential oil.</li>
            <li> The only thing I would change, is to have a squeeze top so the oil doesn&#x27;t come out so fast.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used pure coconut oil as a body lotion for years....</li>
            <li> This oil is so pure it looks like water.  </li>
            <li> It is pure...</li>
            <li> Very high quality product</li>
            <li> I really like this and the large amount you get for the money.</li>
            <li> Overall, this is a great product and does not cost a lot compared to other organic oils!!</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> I really like the feel of this oil.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> much better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It works very well for my home business making body care products.</li>
            <li> This really helps him not to itch and scratch till he bleeds.</li>
            <li> I expected more from this oil.  </li>
            <li> The whole point of buying it fractionated is so that it remains a liquid.</li>
            <li> THE BOTTLE LETS TO MUCH OUT AT A</li>
            <li> THANKS</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast.</li>
            <li> Use this for a lot of different  reasons, the latest being  an all natural bug repellant , it works greaat</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t want to make a mess every time you use it, pour some into a better bottle first.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s many other uses.  </li>
            <li> Not a bad thing, just different!</li>
            <li> It costs less than anywhere else I looked (including some of the big essential oil companies) &amp; is great quality-and a large amount for the price</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is my new found choice for using this at the end of my shower routine and keeping my skin smelling like a REAL COCONUT, healing and keeping it soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks and keep on making it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Enjoy the liquid form, left skin soft</li>
            <li> I  highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I recommend this highly to all oil users.  </li>
            <li> I have decided to use organic products for my skin routine, so this is my new moisturizer at the moment.  </li>
            <li> My oil came in a liquid form, but it was hot outside.</li>
            <li> A co-worker first introduced me to the world of essential oils.</li>
            <li> I use a LOT of Fractionated Coconut Oil but require purity so as not to take away from the benefits of my 100% pure CPTG Essential Oils.  </li>
            <li> I can only conclude that this product may not be 100% pure but has petroleum oil in it.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t clog pores and it works very well as a vehicle for our essential oils as well.</li>
            <li> so far everyone I have applied it on loves it.</li>
            <li> Completely odorless.</li>
            <li> and I was looking for something that&#x27;s natural that does the trick without making my skin feel too greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> As the old adage goes....the proof is in the pudding.</li>
            <li> so you can really smell the essential oils well.  </li>
            <li> The earlier posting about the bottle was VERY helpful.</li>
            <li> You really should have a smaller container of some sort ready when you open this bottle.</li>
            <li> I have since emptied the entire bottle into an empty and clean dish soap bottle to solve the problem.</li>
            <li> It does not sink into the skin as quickly as lotion, which means less reapplication.</li>
            <li> I use it often on my son who has MS and  sometimes has dry skin from certain medications.</li>
            <li> But as I used the oils over the last three months now, I can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li> It helps to stretch my essential oils and makes them last so much longer.</li>
            <li> I like that it is not extremely greasy.</li>
            <li> If I set it down to fast, the oil jumped out of the top of it and splashed, or it ran down the sides after pouring some in my hand when I was careful not to let it spill.</li>
            <li> The oil comes in a clear bottle with simple labeling.</li>
            <li> put the oil on right out of the shower and give it a few minutes to soak in before getting dressed.  </li>
            <li> Least greasy, and absorbs in quickly.</li>
            <li> My husband likes the way it makes his skin feel because his skin is very dry and sensitive.</li>
            <li> To see real results, I believe you have to be consistent and use it everyday for at least a month.  </li>
            <li> , this bottle was hard to get oil out of without making  a huge mess.</li>
            <li> It will last a long time for me.</li>
            <li> . . . it is FAR LESS EXPENSIVE that the miniscule 4 ounce bottles one can order from doTERRA or Young Living Oils for quite a pretty penny!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had been searching for a long time a coconut oil to use in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
            <li> I goes a long way</li>
            <li> Hopefully it will keep for a very long time with out spoiling.</li>
            <li> Helps with dry skin, scalp and hair.</li>
            <li> My husband is Diabetic and has dry legs.</li>
            <li> I imagine it will last forever because we only use a few drops at a time</li>
            <li> The Doterra Coconut Oil is very expensive for the quantity received, thus I wanted to find something else more in my budget.  </li>
            <li> Was hard to use it the first few times without spilling.  </li>
            <li> I love it, just wish it wasn&#x27;t so expensive :/</li>
            <li> If your skin is ultra dry, you will probably need to mix this with some of their other oils like jojoba.</li>
            <li> This is absorbs well and leaves no real fragrance.  </li>
            <li> , I had no issues with shipping or packaging, as this plastic bottle arrived fully closed without nary a leak.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Trifle spendy compared to other oils</li>
            <li> Comparable to other fractionated coconut oil.</li>
            <li> the possibilities are endless.</li>
            <li> The seller is extremely responsive.</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> Something is NOT right.  </li>
            <li> If you have a hard time using regular coconut oil, you may like this oil for a moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> suggest that at least use simple boxes instead of wrapping</li>
            <li> Been using other oils until a friend gave me a sample of this and yup!</li>
            <li> Less greasy than I was expecting.</li>
            <li> Does not leave her skin a slimy oily mess.</li>
            <li> This bottle is not good for daily use.</li>
            <li> This is not nearly the quality I was hoping for, it does not absorb into the skin like my usual product, and doesn&#x27;t seem to have the qualities as others I&#x27;ve tried... Would not recommend as I am not sure as to the &amp;#34;pure organic&amp;#34; claim...</li>
            <li> The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is that the cap is just a cap; unless you put it into a separate dispenser, it is both messy and impossible to dispense the desired quantity (usually you get too much).</li>
            <li> I was looking for a coconut oil with little scent to make my moisturizing body lotion for my husband&#x27;s psoriasis.</li>
            <li> Also I have used other coconut oils in the past with no allergic reaction.  </li>
            <li> The first time I tried to dispense some though, it was nearly impossible to keep the oil from dribbling down the side of the bottle.  </li>
            <li> It hardly resembles any oil other than a rancid liquid.</li>
            <li> And there is no strong smell to it.</li>
            <li> I ran out of my usual and the health food store was out of stock</li>
            <li> Had a small leak..</li>
            <li> If the coconut oil bottle was as thick as the jojoba bottle, then I think there would be no crushing of the bottles</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what fractionated oil is, but this coconut oil doesn&#x27;t solidify in cooler temps.  </li>
            <li> I was nervous buying this because it&#x27;s so much less expensive than the other fractionated coconut oil I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It is not as thick as the Jojoba oil but does the job for about 75% of the price of Jojoba.  </li>
            <li> Works well but difficult to use, consistency of water, which makes it difficult to blend with my essential oils and often creates a mess!</li>
            <li> year (winter time) has been the worst for me as far as dry cuticles, fingers go.  </li>
            <li> Only bad thing is the shipping.  </li>
            <li> This is not a good product.  </li>
            <li> I was looking for an unscented oil base for essential oils and this one fits the bill.  </li>
            <li> There was no package,&lt;br /&gt;the lid was broken and 20% of oil was gone already&lt;br</li>
            <li> Hate, hate, hate the coconut oil in the solid format.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Disappointed that the coconut oil came in a plastic bottle.</li>
    </ol>

    <ol>
            <li> I love it and the fact that it has no scent so I can make my own body oil with the scented oils that are coming to me very soon.</li>
            <li> I use a LOT of Fractionated Coconut Oil but require purity so as not to take away from the benefits of my 100% pure CPTG Essential Oils.  This product by Dr. Adorable is perfect for my needs and affordable at the same time!</li>
            <li> Wish the bottle did not come full to the brim!!!  Was hard to use it the first few times without spilling.  Overall the product is very nice.  Not too oily and a very nice bottle.  Shipped well protected.  Thanks</li>
            <li> Product arrived super fast, was double bagged in a bubble wrap postage bag, and the oil has been great at diluting my doTERRA oils for daily use! No scent, light weight and great alone as a moisturizer or combined with essential oils.</li>
            <li> Product was shipped timely and packaged well.  I bought it to make make one product but have started to research it&#x27;s many other uses.  Would buy this product again.</li>
            <li> Best stuff for skin and hair.  Helps with dry skin, scalp and hair.</li>
            <li> Love this oil best. Least greasy, and absorbs in quickly.</li>
            <li> I used it to make sugar scrubs.  It has no scent of its own so adding fragrance was not a problem</li>
            <li> I went looking for some Coconut Oil that i could use for making my home remedy spa products and this is it!</li>
            <li> Love this oil. I use it to mix with EO.</li>
            <li> Cheaper than most but great quality.  I am using as a carrier oil for my esssential oils.  Also using it for a facial and body moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I love this coconut oil: the price is right, it&#x27;s unscented, and keeps my skin soft &amp; smooth. I&#x27;ve completely stopped using lotion. :)</li>
            <li> I use this oil to massage my wife. I really like the feel of this oil. It heats well and takes scents well too. Just remember to under do the scent. A little goes a long way. Does not leave her skin a slimy oily mess. In fact I think it has helped her skin to keep a healthy glow. Trifle spendy compared to other oils but the only one I will buy from now on.</li>
            <li> Great light oil that mixes well with everything I have tried it with so far.  I will order this again for myself.</li>
            <li> This was just what I wanted.  It helps to stretch my essential oils and makes them last so much longer. The delivery was fast and the bottle was wrapped perfect. The price was fantastic too.  I will def purchase this again from Dr. Adorable, and I love the name too!</li>
            <li> I tried DoTerra&#x27;s fractionated coconut oil.  I really liked the feel of the product, but I the price point is not cost effective for my massage business.  I then went on a search for something that could make my wallet happy and I found this product.  Luckily, I ordered the 16oz bottle.  It&#x27;s a slightly more viscous than the DoTerra brand... The feel is a bit heavier.  I&#x27;m still on my quest to find the fractionated coconut oil that&#x27;s a fit for my practice.</li>
            <li> We use this to moisturize our faces after spritzing with rose water and it keeps our faces hydrated throughout the day without feeling or looking oily. It doesn&#x27;t clog pores and it works very well as a vehicle for our essential oils as well. I imagine it will last forever because we only use a few drops at a time but if it ever runs out I will certainly purchase this again!</li>
            <li> Hate, hate, hate the coconut oil in the solid format. This blend better with my smoothies, works well with essential oils and is easy to cook with.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used pure coconut oil as a body lotion for years.... I ran out of my usual and the health food store was out of stock so I thought I&#x27;d try Dr. Adorable&#x27;s... This is not nearly the quality I was hoping for, it does not absorb into the skin like my usual product, and doesn&#x27;t seem to have the qualities as others I&#x27;ve tried... Would not recommend as I am not sure as to the &amp;#34;pure organic&amp;#34; claim...</li>
            <li> I use this soap to make my own cleaner for furniture.  It works very well-releases dirt and add a beautiful shine at the same time. This is a versatile product and has many uses.  I  highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Great for oil pulling!</li>
            <li> I was looking for an unscented oil base for essential oils and this one fits the bill.  The shipping was SUPER fast too.  Will order again in the future.</li>
            <li> Excellent product...works very very well with essential oil application. It lasts for an entire massage without drying out (and requiring more). Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Great product! will purchase again.</li>
            <li> This is absorbs well and leaves no real fragrance.  My skin is in better condition than when I use all the expensive body lotions.&lt;br /&gt;Great product.</li>
            <li> like I said before. awesome pruduct. recommend it to anyone.  so far everyone I have applied it on loves it.</li>
            <li> I recently started using Doterra oils and found that many oils need a carrier oil.  The Doterra Coconut Oil is very expensive for the quantity received, thus I wanted to find something else more in my budget.  This oil is perfect!  You get 3-4 times more oil for the same price as Doterra&#x27;s.  I&#x27;ve used it for several weeks now and it works great as a carrier oil for essential oils.  I recommend this highly to all oil users.  Definitely more for your money without lowering the quality!</li>
            <li> This stuff last forever. It is perfect to mix with essential oils. Hopefully it will keep for a very long time with out spoiling. And there is no strong smell to it. It is a generous amount that you get for the amount of money you pay.</li>
            <li> This oil is so pure it looks like water.  It is the perfect carrier oil for many of my favorite essential oil blends.  I do, however, prefer almond oil for massage so if you&#x27;re looking for a massage oil, you might like a thicker oil but it&#x27;s a matter of personal preference.</li>
            <li> I would have given this 5 stars if it had an ingredient list on the back but it does not.</li>
            <li> This product slides on silky-slinky and does not leave an oily residue.  Soaks in well, and my skin is softer.  Product was delivered expeditiously.  Thank you Dr. Adorable.</li>
            <li> The oil is fine.,  It is convenient that it does not solidify.  And no smell.&lt;br /&gt;I am not giving 5 stars for these reasons:&lt;br /&gt;- The organic claim is not certified.  When enquired they say they are working on getting certification.&lt;br /&gt;- They used environmentally harmful and wasteful styrofoam peanuts and unused plastic USPS Priority Mail envelops as packing material when shipping.</li>
            <li> I avoided giving a review for this item, but then the request keeps popping up.  This is not a good product.  It hardly resembles any oil other than a rancid liquid.</li>
            <li> All Dr Adorable organic oils are excellent!!</li>
            <li> I never knew that coco oil could be so good and versatile. I use it for topical application and for cooking and could not be more satisfied.</li>
            <li> Gave as a gift to my daughters and to myself.  Nice quality. I like the way it feels on my skin. Use to mix with essential oils.</li>
            <li> This is the first coconut oil I have used and I love it. It absorbs into my skin nicely and does not leave a greasy feeling afterward. My husband likes the way it makes his skin feel because his skin is very dry and sensitive.</li>
            <li> If you use essential oils which need to be diluted, this is the product to use!  It&#x27;s &amp;#34;pure&amp;#34; liquid coconut oil, without scent, and makes a great EO combo to put into roll-on bottles.  And the best part is . .  . . . it is FAR LESS EXPENSIVE that the miniscule 4 ounce bottles one can order from doTERRA or Young Living Oils for quite a pretty penny!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I had no issues with shipping or packaging, as this plastic bottle arrived fully closed without nary a leak.  Yeah!</li>
            <li> Very nice oil to add other oil to.  It is perfect for many health and fitness needs.</li>
            <li> So happy with this oil. It costs less than anywhere else I looked (including some of the big essential oil companies) &amp; is great quality-and a large amount for the price</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s such a great price:). Love it for diluting my essential oils!  And it shipped fast:).  I will be buying lots from the Dr.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve paired this product with essential oils and I&#x27;m quite pleased with the results.&lt;br /&gt;Application was easy and it disperses well.&lt;br /&gt;The customer service on this purchase would prompt me to purchase product from them again.&lt;br /&gt;Fast and painless!  A good go-to company!</li>
            <li> Love the consistency of this oil and mixing it with my essential oils.  Recommend it to anyone.  You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Amazed that it is odorless. Mixed it with almond oil and my bees wax to make a really great hand cream.</li>
            <li> Clear, smooth, rubs into skin easily.</li>
            <li> Works well but difficult to use, consistency of water, which makes it difficult to blend with my essential oils and often creates a mess! Prefer unfractionated personally.</li>
            <li> I have curly hair and it works great.</li>
            <li> I really like this and the large amount you get for the money. Works great!</li>
            <li> Wonderful oil. I use it with my essential oils almost every day. The oil is light and absorbs quickly into the skin/hair. Just love this oil:)</li>
            <li> This is better than hard coconut oil that would get stuck in my razor, this gives you a nice close shave without the irritation. I love it, just wish it wasn&#x27;t so expensive :/</li>
            <li> I have not had the opportunity to use this product at this time.  But I am sure it will work great for me when I do.</li>
            <li> I use this odorless, great textured product on many of my clients. It does not sink into the skin as quickly as lotion, which means less reapplication. Also, it is great for mixing essential oils. Just make sure you put it in a different container (I put it in a pump bottle), as it is really full (more for your money, I&#x27;m not complaining.) I definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> Disappointed that the coconut oil came in a plastic bottle. I use it exclusively as a carrier oil for essential oils. I did purchase Ah Shayh Virgin Coconut oil to use on my face. It came in a glass jar.</li>
            <li> It works great...2nd time ordering it.</li>
            <li> I love this oil! I mix it with organic shea butter and it is extra moisturizing! I will definitely purchase again and recommend to anyone!</li>
            <li> Best oil for my blends!</li>
            <li> Perfect for making soap and body washes and diluting essential oils</li>
            <li> Had a small leak..I&#x27;ve had to transfer to a different container..looks like was cracked during shipping</li>
            <li> Amazing! Super fast shipping! Great Product!</li>
            <li> I will buy again and again!</li>
            <li> Very high quality product</li>
            <li> This is a great and light oil. Less greasy than I was expecting. I have decided to use organic products for my skin routine, so this is my new moisturizer at the moment.  The only problem I have is with the cap.  A lot of oil comes out of it and sometimes it spills everywhere.  I will probably transfer this to a smaller container with a roller or something.  This is a moisturizing oil, but as said in the ad it is to be used as a carrier. If your skin is ultra dry, you will probably need to mix this with some of their other oils like jojoba. I am going to order that next time. Overall, this is a great product and does not cost a lot compared to other organic oils!!</li>
            <li> Great product! I was looking for a coconut oil with little scent to make my moisturizing body lotion for my husband&#x27;s psoriasis. I use essential oils and the Doterra oil was too costly to use every day. I am happy with this product and would recommend it to other oil users and the price was great!</li>
            <li> I love this product.  So soothing and makes your skin feel wonderful love love love</li>
            <li> Update 4/1/15 - Something is NOT right.  I have used this product for a couple of times since my last review below.  I experienced an allergic reaction causing small blisters and redness to appear on the areas I applied the oil to.  What is significant is that I am allergic to skin products that contain petroleum.  Also I have used other coconut oils in the past with no allergic reaction.  I can only conclude that this product may not be 100% pure but has petroleum oil in it.  I noticed this product is manufactured in the Philippines and am suspicious of the labeled ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&lt;br /&gt;It is not as thick as the Jojoba oil but does the job for about 75% of the price of Jojoba.  Only bad thing is the shipping.  When I received the product through the mail, some of the oil leaked out.  The manufacture tried to prevent this by putting a anti-tamper seal on the bottle and applying a piece of clear tape over the screw top to prevent it from accidentally loosening.  This are good ideas, but the bottle is too flimsy and gets crushed during shipping.  If the coconut oil bottle was as thick as the jojoba bottle, then I think there would be no crushing of the bottles and this would mitigate leaking.</li>
            <li> As advertised, a great oil for massage - not so oily, yet still very smooth. Smoothness is also durable - no need to continually re-apply. Completely odorless. The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is that the cap is just a cap; unless you put it into a separate dispenser, it is both messy and impossible to dispense the desired quantity (usually you get too much). With a flip-top dispenser of some sort this would be perfect and well worth a 5-star review.</li>
            <li> If you have a hard time using regular coconut oil, you may like this oil for a moisturizer.  I found that my skin feels great for the first couple of hours, but as the day goes on my skin is still dry at the end.  My legs end up itching at night. My favorite lotion is cetaphil and I was looking for something that&#x27;s natural that does the trick without making my skin feel too greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put the oil on right out of the shower and give it a few minutes to soak in before getting dressed.  It wasn&#x27;t too oily for me.  I was really happy with it until I realized after about a week of using it that my skin is dry and itchy.  I like jojoba oil much better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, this bottle was hard to get oil out of without making  a huge mess. If I set it down to fast, the oil jumped out of the top of it and splashed, or it ran down the sides after pouring some in my hand when I was careful not to let it spill.</li>
            <li> Absolutely loving this product. It works very well for my home business making body care products. It doesn&#x27;t have a scent at all. I am definitely buying this again!</li>
            <li> This is my official oil as of now! Been using other oils until a friend gave me a sample of this and yup! Perfect!</li>
            <li> good product, good price, fast shipping</li>
            <li> My husband is Diabetic and has dry legs. This really helps him not to itch and scratch till he bleeds. Thank you!!!</li>
            <li> excellent coconut oil - you can even tale it by the spoon full</li>
            <li> GREAT OIL FOR MASSAGING OR JUST GETTING OUT OF THE SHOWER SKIN SOFTENER!&lt;br /&gt;TOTALLY SATISFIED AMAZON SHOPPER!!!  :)</li>
            <li> Wonderful item. I use it for my Doterra essential oil mixtures for myself and also for my dogs.</li>
            <li> I cannot speak to the quality of the oil.  The first time I tried to dispense some though, it was nearly impossible to keep the oil from dribbling down the side of the bottle.  I have since emptied the entire bottle into an empty and clean dish soap bottle to solve the problem.</li>
            <li> I bought it for me and hubby is using it all the time</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been through 3 bottles of this stuff and I think it is high-quality oil. I will continue to purchase this for use with my essential oil potions and protocols.</li>
            <li> I expected more from this oil.  I&#x27;m not sure what fractionated oil is, but this coconut oil doesn&#x27;t solidify in cooler temps.  Not a bad thing, just different!</li>
            <li> This oil is perfect as a carrier for my therapeutic oils and gets used daily. Perfect for my needs and a great value. I love it.</li>
            <li> I am getting into essential oils and now using this as my carrier oil.  I like that it is not extremely greasy.</li>
            <li> I use this product on my skin, for massaging &amp; my dogs belly for her skin problem. It&#x27;s perfect since it&#x27;s all natural &amp; unscented :)</li>
            <li> Have used this in making body wash and with essential oils.  Am very pleased with it.  will recommend to friends.</li>
            <li> I use this product from head to toe! It&#x27;s great in the shower just before drying off. I use it often on my son who has MS and  sometimes has dry skin from certain medications. I also use it on my hair and love the way it leaves my hair feeling nice and light, not weighted down and greasy.</li>
            <li> My oil came in a liquid form, but it was hot outside. Once it reached room temperature it solidified. The whole point of buying it fractionated is so that it remains a liquid. I had to cut the bottle open and scoop it out. We still used it but I would have preferred that it remain a liquid for my purposes and for the price.</li>
            <li> Enjoy the liquid form, left skin soft</li>
            <li> I ordered the Organic Pure Fractionated Coconut Oil and it arrived quickly despite a three day ice storm. The oil comes in a clear bottle with simple labeling. I have used it twice with wonderful results. I will use this seller again.</li>
            <li> I LIKE THE OIL THE BOTTLE LETS TO MUCH OUT AT A TIME.BUT IN AM GETTING USED TO IT. THANKS</li>
            <li> I use this with my essential oils. Very good price and quality. Order two or more at a time to save shipping.</li>
            <li> I bought this to use with essential oils. It was shipped quickly and seems to be a good quality oil.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a massage therapist and I really love the light weight of coconut oil and how nicely it soaks into skin while still leaving a good glide.  I was nervous buying this because it&#x27;s so much less expensive than the other fractionated coconut oil I&#x27;ve used.  I really love it.  Nice, light, no odor (unlike the Bon Vital version).  I&#x27;ll definitely be buying more.</li>
            <li> Love this product. I use it for everything, works great for hair, feet and skin. Doesnt leave any greasy residue.</li>
            <li> I use a lot of therapeutic essential oils and this coconut oil is perfect as a carrier oil. It&#x27;s light, odorless  and non-greasy. PERFECT!&lt;br /&gt;You can&#x27;t tell there&#x27;s a carrier oil added at all.</li>
            <li> How do I love this product? Let me count the ways:&lt;br /&gt;I use in body lotion - any inexpensive lotion will do;&lt;br /&gt;I add it in leave in serums for my hair - it is a most potent weapon against psoriasis;&lt;br /&gt;After showering and toweling off, I smear  a little in my pubic area to keep that area nice and fresh (coconut oil is an antimicrobial);&lt;br /&gt;If I am out of my Kerasal foot ointment, I use this on my feet.</li>
            <li> Use this for a lot of different  reasons, the latest being  an all natural bug repellant , it works greaat</li>
            <li> I thought this was a good price and I needed it in a hurry.</li>
            <li> I had been searching for a long time a coconut oil to use in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One local company used to make all my favorite flavors of oil sprays I used in the shower to keep my skin smelling great but more so, soft and not dried out and cracked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This year (winter time) has been the worst for me as far as dry cuticles, fingers go.  Cracked, drying, peeling, bleeding. YUCK!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I finally found this product and even posted to the posters there asking questions before i tried it out and bought it.  They were a big help and thanks!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product has NO fragances and perfumes in it... It is pure... I am amazed and impressed that no matter the weather conditions (unusual winter here in Calif. temps at night getting to 40&#x27;s, 30&#x27;s and now below freezing levels of 28 degrees) inflicted on this product, it stays liquified.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is my new found choice for using this at the end of my shower routine and keeping my skin smelling like a REAL COCONUT, healing and keeping it soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks and keep on making it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~M</li>
            <li> Great product! Comparable to other fractionated coconut oil.</li>
            <li> Great product and delivered fast</li>
            <li> This oil is very nice on my skin</li>
            <li> I use it every day, leave my feeling good</li>
            <li> A co-worker first introduced me to the world of essential oils. I hesitantly used her samples over the course of two (2) months which I later learned to absolutely love. As I continued on my journey to research more on the history and usefulness of essential oils, I couldn&#x27;t believe more people weren&#x27;t using this. I thought to myself - is this a gimmick that only people like me buy into? But as I used the oils over the last three months now, I can&#x27;t live without it. As the old adage goes....the proof is in the pudding. The sample my co-worker gave me was mixed with coconut oil and vanilla that can be used as a room spray, face &amp; body moisturizer, make-up remover etc...the possibilities are endless. To see real results, I believe you have to be consistent and use it everyday for at least a month.  Thank you Dr Adorable Inc. I&#x27;ll continue using this product and will definitely recommend to my family and friends.</li>
            <li> The product is a nice scent free and lightweight oil and it easily abosrbed into the skin. I use this as a carrier oil for my Doterra products. The seller is extremely responsive. I had problems getting my order here and Laura was a gem and worked with me to ensure I had my oils here just in time for my meeting. Thank you and I will definitely come back for future needs!</li>
            <li> Using this as a carrier oil, works wonderfully.  It doesn&#x27;t have an aroma so you can really smell the essential oils well.  Absorbs quickly so you don&#x27;t feel to greasy.</li>
            <li> I love the oil.  The only thing I would change, is to have a squeeze top so the oil doesn&#x27;t come out so fast.  Other than that, I will be ordering again. Shipping was fast.</li>
            <li> There was no package,&lt;br /&gt;the lid was broken and 20% of oil was gone already&lt;br /&gt;the wrap was oily and leaking&lt;br /&gt;I suggest that at least use simple boxes instead of wrapping</li>
            <li> i have used this in my hair on my dogs hair, on my skin and feet also.  it feels great and smells wonderful</li>
            <li> I use this in my bubble bath that I make its a great price for the oz you get. It will last a long time for me. will order again.</li>
            <li> I love this oil.  I add my own essential oils to make a variety of massage and therapeutic oils.  It adds no smell and is perfect for my needs!</li>
            <li> Superior product, fast shipping, and great price!!! Thank you!  I will be back for more.</li>
            <li> Mixed with an essential oil, or not, this has wonderful glide and moisturizing.</li>
            <li> I bought this to use as a \\&quot;carrier oil\\&quot; for the various essential oils I use on my face.&lt;br /&gt; I love it so much~I now mix it with almost all my body oils and lotions~not only to make them last longer~but because it just feels soooo good on my skin!!! I goes a long way too!!!&lt;br /&gt; GREAT product! I love it! </li>
            <li> The oil is not greasy at all but doesn&#x27;t get absorbed too quickly. Perfect for massaging. No scent, so you can mix with your favorite essential oil. The earlier posting about the bottle was VERY helpful. You really should have a smaller container of some sort ready when you open this bottle. This bottle is not good for daily use. If you don&#x27;t want to make a mess every time you use it, pour some into a better bottle first.</li>
