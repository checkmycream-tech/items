    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>This has worked great for me!  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve decided that this geodeo was the best smelling stick, with no irritation at the best price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Out of organic deodorants I&#x27;ve tried this is probably the best ...</li>
            <li>After giving the detox a chance to work this DEO is amazing even on the hottest sweatiest days!!</li>
            <li>it works great for him.</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>Really great deodorant</li>
            <li>No skin reaction, smells great and does the job.</li>
            <li>Great price.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s been great.  </li>
            <li>but a GREAT man smell.</li>
            <li>called the company to compliment them on their product and they were very nice.  </li>
            <li>He loves the ease of use and the nice scent!  </li>
            <li>Pleasant, neutral scent.</li>
            <li>All three are good at preventing odor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They keep the bacteria that cause the B.O. smell from growing, and work surprisingly well for just being a chunk of salt.</li>
            <li>Sounds good huh?</li>
            <li>The &amp;#34;ocean&amp;#34; scent smells good too.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also used their Island scent which is really good too but being a fella I tend to stick with this</li>
            <li>if you order this product and aren&#x27;t happy give it a couple weeks before you make a decision; also make sure to fully cover the underarm when you apply.  </li>
            <li>let me just start out by saying this ANY Geodeo deodorant is AMAZING.</li>
            <li>I can attest that it has remained effective for periods longer than 48 hours...</li>
            <li>Thanks for a great product!</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t get a coupon or anything, but they still were nice.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own</li>
            <li>The deodorant smells good, but but it has more of a manly scent to it than I would&#x27;ve guessed.</li>
            <li>but this product is the best natural deodorant I have found.  </li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t amazing, but not terrible either.</li>
            <li>Best natural deodorant I&#x27;ve used...</li>
            <li>yet the smell quickly wears off, which is actually good because if you&#x27;re wearing a cologne/perfume, that wouldn&#x27;t be overpowered.</li>
            <li>Had to leave the favorite because glands were clogging or something.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve tried so many \\&quot;natural\\&quot; type deodorants.  </li>
            <li>Lovely.  </li>
            <li>Why is it that most &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; deodorant products leave you smelling au naturel?</li>
            <li>It uses the buzz words we all love...</li>
            <li>This one is the best bang for the buck in my opinion, but definitely will get me about 1/2-3/4 way through my day.  </li>
            <li>The coverage time has gotten better and better.</li>
            <li>Glad I made the switch</li>
            <li>But, sweating, while gross, is good for you!</li>
            <li>and it goes on easy</li>
            <li>Not too strong.</li>
            <li>I smelled the scented ones and thought they might be too strong, but after using them I discovered they aren&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li>For a natural deodorant this works and has a pleasant smell.  </li>
            <li>If you are truly wanting to go Natural, this is a good bet</li>
            <li>however the other smell Island, is more fruity and girly, yet as a man, probably prefer that one because I just love those kind of smells more.</li>
            <li>I cannot say that the &amp;#34;24-hour protection&amp;#34; claim is accurate for me, but if I apply it at night, and in the morning (and maybe once more during a really hot day) it does work well for me.  </li>
            <li>This is important to me especially because I go from a shop setting to a corporate office setting many times during the day and want to smell my best when I&#x27;m in front of the CEO.</li>
            <li>It gets better immediately, but that first turn is</li>
            <li>gave this a 4 star rating because it is a deodorant, but you must reapply to keep things fresh!</li>
            <li>The Ocean scent is pleasant, not overpowering, but enough to counteract your body smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once</li>
            <li>, I feel this is true.</li>
            <li>It smells nice, is natural, and the scent lasts all day.</li>
            <li>: I also purchased from PPP their Primer spray, which is basically witchhazel and essential oils, and that is pretty much amazing!</li>
            <li>Understand that I have to reapply conventional deodorants just as often, and haven&#x27;t been as happy with the results.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Scent is good, it&#x27;s not really clear</li>
            <li>My husband also has a hard time finding a deodorant that is easy on his armpits and this deodorant was great for him in that respect as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Was looking for something that was more natural without all the &amp;#34;stuff&amp;#34; in it.</li>
            <li>I like that this one is more natural, as well.</li>
            <li>stuff I&#x27;ve found that goes on easily and clear and works.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t really aware I had allergies</li>
            <li>;)  </li>
            <li>That being said, I now sometimes use this deodorant in conjunction with baking soda; I first apply the deodorant and then pat on a bit of baking soda afterwards.</li>
            <li>This is the first &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>With so many users complaining about it not lasting, I&#x27;m stocking up.</li>
            <li>That didn&#x27;t bother me because I am married</li>
            <li>maybe in the future i&#x27;ll just get the unscented and not worry about it, but all-in-all; what a fantastic deodorant!</li>
            <li>but it doesn&#x27;t do much to keep you fresh during the day.</li>
            <li>Any will get the job done by keeping down perspiration and being a great natural product.</li>
            <li>It seemed to be less effective the first week I was using it, so</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have to reapply it multiple times a day, it smells fine</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s hard to explain, but it&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li>and I have to say it&#x27;s effective while not having to worry about absorbing heavy metals like aluminum into my body.  </li>
            <li>Of the countless Aluminum free deodorants I have tried this one really works for me, even in sticky NYC summers.</li>
            <li>It goes on rather smooth to me, much like traditional invisible solids.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t perspire much, so that isn&#x27;t an issue.</li>
            <li>5 dollars from my healthfood store and didn&#x27;t sweat much at all at my job and smelled funky 1/2-way</li>
            <li>nothing strong and hard, but a light decent &amp;#34;im-a-guy&amp;#34</li>
            <li>this scent in particular</li>
            <li>I prefer natural products when I can get them, but generally from both personal experience and the experiences of friends and family, most &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; deodorants just don&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I would have preferred to get the unscented version but this fragrance is very light and dissipates after a few hours, which does not affect the effectiveness of</li>
            <li>Natural deodorant, no aluminum, and it really works.  </li>
            <li>Normal deodorant has always bothered my skin and sometimes caused a rash.</li>
            <li>For me protection never lasts more than a few hours.</li>
            <li>The deodorant worked ok, but didn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li>Not flowery or feminine but also doesn&#x27;t smell like my father--that classic &amp;#34;manly&amp;#34; old spice, brute, speed stick or whatever perfume.</li>
            <li>though, I&#x27;m going to be using this until I find a better natural option which I&#x27;m not really looking to do at the current time.</li>
            <li>During this detox you sweat and STINK so much more than usual.</li>
            <li>Definitely doesn&#x27;t last a full 24 hours, maybe about 8-10 on me.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Somewhat negative: the top is hard to get off, andthere is a cap-thing which is stuck inside the top of the cap.  </li>
            <li>It was painful, this has fit the bill nicely.</li>
            <li>So I gave this to my nine year old</li>
            <li>I have tried almost every natural deodorant, and no of them work - except this brand.  </li>
            <li>I tried a number of hypoallergenic and natural sticks</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re sensitive to fragrances, I&#x27;d still avoid them.  </li>
            <li>natural deodorants</li>
            <li>It actually works this way, haha...)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been searching for a natural deodorant that works and this one isn&#x27;t it.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a natural deodorant, do yourself a favor and keep looking.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a bunch of organic deodorants as the anti-perspirants and Old Spices with non-organic deodorants will stain clothing.  </li>
            <li>the protection isn&#x27;t fantastic, so I usually end up carrying an extra stick with me if I&#x27;m going to the lake or out at night during the summer when I know it&#x27;ll be hot.  </li>
            <li>The combo of the primer and natural deodorant is a WIN.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I remain on the hunt for a working natural deodorant.</li>
            <li>Only complaint is they don&#x27;t put more of the stuff in each container.  </li>
            <li>As i use this more, i find i need deodorant less and less.  </li>
            <li>Ocean scent smelled a bit strong and like a typical &#x27;regular&#x27; (not natural) deodorant.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re set on a natural product that actually works, don&#x27;t buy this.</li>
            <li>We have been using natural deodorants for years and this is only one of two that actually work for him!  </li>
            <li>The only natural deodorant product I&#x27;ve used that has ever worked for me are those salt crystal ones sold under various names and brands.</li>
            <li>I tested it the usual way-put it on right after showering before bed, woke up in the morning, and checked for B.O.</li>

            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a natural deodorant, do yourself a favor and keep looking.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a bunch of organic deodorants as the anti-perspirants and Old Spices with non-organic deodorants will stain clothing.  </li>
            <li> the protection isn&#x27;t fantastic, so I usually end up carrying an extra stick with me if I&#x27;m going to the lake or out at night during the summer when I know it&#x27;ll be hot.  </li>

            <li> Only complaint is they don&#x27;t put more of the stuff in each container.  </li>

            <li> Ocean scent smelled a bit strong and like a typical &#x27;regular&#x27; (not natural) deodorant.  </li>

            <li> Also, the first time you use it, it&#x27;s hard to turn the stick.  </li>
            <li> In fact, the slight smell of the deodorant, which smells quite nice in the stick, mixes with the smell of the B.O. to combine into an even worse smell!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> If you sweat excessively, exercise, or have nervous sweat this is not the product for you. After three hours I smelled awful. Gave it to my parents to try thinking it was just me (I had a three pack) nope they had the same problem. So I gave this to my nine year old it works great for him.</li>
            <li> For a natural deodorant this works and has a pleasant smell.  Had to leave the favorite because glands were clogging or something.  It was painful, this has fit the bill nicely.</li>
            <li> I have tried almost every natural deodorant, and no of them work - except this brand.  Everything us makes you stink before noon, but this lasts (even days). Great product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for several months and I have to say it&#x27;s effective while not having to worry about absorbing heavy metals like aluminum into my body.  It seemed to be less effective the first week I was using it, so if you order this product and aren&#x27;t happy give it a couple weeks before you make a decision; also make sure to fully cover the underarm when you apply.  Really great deodorant though, I&#x27;m going to be using this until I find a better natural option which I&#x27;m not really looking to do at the current time.</li>
            <li> Normal deodorant has always bothered my skin and sometimes caused a rash. Was looking for something that was more natural without all the &amp;#34;stuff&amp;#34; in it. This has worked great for me!  No skin reaction, smells great and does the job. Works all day for me, might not last as long as some other brands but has not been an issue  and worth the other benefits.</li>
            <li> Natural deodorant, no aluminum, and it really works.  Great price. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> After giving the detox a chance to work this DEO is amazing even on the hottest sweatiest days!! Even when I&#x27;ve forgotten to use it and applied nothing at all...I can attest that it has remained effective for periods longer than 48 hours...THIS STUFF WORKS!!!</li>
            <li> Just got the package and tried it. I like how the stick deodorant glides on my skin. I like the fragrance. Not too heavy. Not too strong.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t really aware I had allergies but I recently took the patch test and was informed that one of the common ingredients in deodorant was irritating me. I tried a number of hypoallergenic and natural sticks and I&#x27;ve decided that this geodeo was the best smelling stick, with no irritation at the best price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I knocked it down one star because I usually have to reapply in the afternoon. However, this might be a side effect of not having industrial chemicals to carry it through.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this!  We have been using natural deodorants for years and this is only one of two that actually work for him!  Other brands were not effective at all!  He loves the ease of use and the nice scent!  Thanks for a great product!</li>
            <li> I tried all three--unscented, Island, and Ocean.  All of them worked the same for me, so this is a review of all of them (with a remark about each scent at the bottom).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried so many \\&quot;natural\\&quot; type deodorants.  I don&#x27;t need or want the antiperspirant (aluminum) component of deodorants.  I just want something which will stop odor. Deodorants stop odor and antiperspirants stop wetness.  Unfortunately, antiperspirants require alum or aluminum, neither of which I want on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried almost all the popular \\&quot;natural\\&quot; brands and am disappointed by the end of the day.  They just don&#x27;t work.  I&#x27;m not a heavy laborer or anything like it, but some of them seem to make me smell awful.  I bought this brand, not expecting it to work, but it was on sale at our local co-op.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, I&#x27;ve used it for ten days (I apply it every morning) and it&#x27;s been great.  I don&#x27;t perspire much, so that isn&#x27;t an issue. As I said, I am trying to avoid alum (like the mineral stick put out for the Geodeo people) and aluminum products.  This doesn&#x27;t have it in it, so you may perspire with it.  I&#x27;ll take my chances with perspiration instead of aluminum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried three versions: unscented, Island, and Ocean.  I smelled the scented ones and thought they might be too strong, but after using them I discovered they aren&#x27;t.  If you&#x27;re sensitive to fragrances, I&#x27;d still avoid them.  All three are good at preventing odor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unlike other deodorants (Mennon Speed Stick, for example), these don&#x27;t leave an icky residue on your skin, even after showering.  I&#x27;m sold on them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I called the company to compliment them on their product and they were very nice.  I didn&#x27;t get a coupon or anything, but they still were nice.  ;)  I&#x27;m going to put this comment on all three versions, so if you see it I&#x27;m not trying to put anything over on anyone.  I&#x27;ve used all three and want to comment on them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Somewhat negative: the top is hard to get off, andthere is a cap-thing which is stuck inside the top of the cap.  The rep told me that is supposed to be there to keep it from drying out, but I didn&#x27;t know that and tried to remove it.  Also, the first time you use it, it&#x27;s hard to turn the stick.  It gets better immediately, but that first turn is hard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Ocean scent smelled a bit strong and like a typical &#x27;regular&#x27; (not natural) deodorant.  However, the scent doesn&#x27;t last long and is not overpowering.</li>
            <li> Terrible. 5 dollars from my healthfood store and didn&#x27;t sweat much at all at my job and smelled funky 1/2-way they my 12-hr shift. Lovely.  👎👎 Ocean smells like bug spray too. Terrible product! Yuck! Yuck!!!</li>
            <li> Of the countless Aluminum free deodorants I have tried this one really works for me, even in sticky NYC summers. I would have preferred to get the unscented version but this fragrance is very light and dissipates after a few hours, which does not affect the effectiveness of the product.&lt;br /&gt;With natural deodorants it seems to be a matter of finding one that works for one&#x27;s individual body chemistry.</li>
            <li> Agree with all other users that you have to give this one time.  I&#x27;m not an overly excessive sweater either, so I guess I can&#x27;t speak for that but this product is the best natural deodorant I have found.  I don&#x27;t have to reapply it multiple times a day, it smells fine and it goes on easy ( I don&#x27;t know if there are different types, but I do not agree with the other reviews that say this goes on hard, that seemed like a weird review of this product to me).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Full disclosure, I have not used a &amp;#34;mainstream&amp;#34; deodorant for years, so I would agree with all reviews that you need to detox your body from that crap before this would work for you.  Like 1-2 months, even.  If you are truly wanting to go Natural, this is a good bet and I have tried close to every alternative out there.</li>
            <li> Why is it that most &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; deodorant products leave you smelling au naturel? I prefer natural products when I can get them, but generally from both personal experience and the experiences of friends and family, most &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; deodorants just don&#x27;t work. Still, I bought this product on a whim, because I wanted to see if the &amp;#34;odor neutralizing enzymes&amp;#34; in it truly worked. I tested it the usual way-put it on right after showering before bed, woke up in the morning, and checked for B.O. It didn&#x27;t work at all! In fact, the slight smell of the deodorant, which smells quite nice in the stick, mixes with the smell of the B.O. to combine into an even worse smell! I&#x27;ve tried Tom&#x27;s of Maine deodorant before too, same problem, not only did it not prevent the B.O., it added to it! The only natural deodorant product I&#x27;ve used that has ever worked for me are those salt crystal ones sold under various names and brands. They keep the bacteria that cause the B.O. smell from growing, and work surprisingly well for just being a chunk of salt. I can&#x27;t imagine how Geodeo is supposed to be a deodorant for running around during the day when it can&#x27;t even inhibit bacteria growth at night, when you&#x27;re not even sweating. If you&#x27;re set on a natural product that actually works, don&#x27;t buy this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve yet to try this deodorant on a humid summer day, but it&#x27;s working like a dream under layers of winter sweaters!</li>
            <li> Pleasant, neutral scent. Only works for 3-4 hours. I&#x27;m not terribly stinky once this deodorant starts to fail, but yes, I&#x27;m stinky. Reapplying this didn&#x27;t help either.  (Note: I purchased this at a local health food store, not on Amazon.)  (Extra info: Sometimes I use a homemade deodorant paste made with a little corn starch, baking soda and water. It&#x27;s the only thing that truly works for me. [That is, until my pits get used to it. When that happens, I have to switch to something else for sometime.] That being said, I now sometimes use this deodorant in conjunction with baking soda; I first apply the deodorant and then pat on a bit of baking soda afterwards. It actually works this way, haha...)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for a natural deodorant that works and this one isn&#x27;t it. It uses the buzz words we all love...&amp;#34;24 hour protection&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;detox&amp;#34;. Sounds good huh? Well it doesn&#x27;t work well. The solid is waxy and hard. This makes application a bit difficult. For me protection never lasts more than a few hours. I feel like I smell worse at the end of the day than if I would&#x27;ve just worn nothing. If you&#x27;re looking for a natural deodorant, do yourself a favor and keep looking.</li>
            <li> For a 3 pack, this was the cheapest organic.  I&#x27;ve tried a bunch of organic deodorants as the anti-perspirants and Old Spices with non-organic deodorants will stain clothing.  This one is the best bang for the buck in my opinion, but definitely will get me about 1/2-3/4 way through my day.  I do sweat and stink above average, or at least that&#x27;s what my gf says.</li>
            <li> Out of organic deodorants I&#x27;ve tried this is probably the best ... the protection isn&#x27;t fantastic, so I usually end up carrying an extra stick with me if I&#x27;m going to the lake or out at night during the summer when I know it&#x27;ll be hot.  That way I can use it once or twice if needed when away from home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Scent is good, it&#x27;s not really clear so you usually have to let it dry before you get max protection from it.  i would recommend it amongst the organic/natural deodorants though.</li>
            <li> I cannot say that the &amp;#34;24-hour protection&amp;#34; claim is accurate for me, but if I apply it at night, and in the morning (and maybe once more during a really hot day) it does work well for me.  Understand that I have to reapply conventional deodorants just as often, and haven&#x27;t been as happy with the results.  I like that this one is more natural, as well.</li>
            <li> I am not displeased with this. Only complaint is they don&#x27;t put more of the stuff in each container.  It works every time.</li>
            <li> At first I was disappointed because like other reviewers have stated, it was only lasting about three hours. Since I work from home though, I figured I mine as well use it up even if i have to reapply often. But about ten days to two weeks in, I noticed that my stink wasn&#x27;t showing up after three hours. Even up a closer smell. The coverage time has gotten better and better. I even forget to apply once after 24 hours and eight hours later, my stink was minimal. My theory is it took some time for me underarm bacteria or something in or on my body to adapt to the non-toxic stuff. This is the first &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; stuff I&#x27;ve found that goes on easily and clear and works. The &amp;#34;ocean&amp;#34; scent smells good too. Not overpowering. Not flowery or feminine but also doesn&#x27;t smell like my father--that classic &amp;#34;manly&amp;#34; old spice, brute, speed stick or whatever perfume. With so many users complaining about it not lasting, I&#x27;m stocking up.</li>
            <li> I first bought a multi-pack of these a few years ago, tried it for a few days, I sweat and stank, they all went to the back of my drawer. Fast forward to a few months ago. I&#x27;ve been actively removing chemicals from my life. I remembered I had bought these, so I decided to try again while waiting for my PrimalPitPaste to come, which was recommended by a friend. Upon my research, I read that when you switch from regular antiperspirants and chemical deodorants your skin and pores need to DETOX from it. During this detox you sweat and STINK so much more than usual. You need to power through it! I made a point to start over a long weekend where I knew I wasn&#x27;t going to be too active to reduce my possibility of smelling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I used Geodeo for about a week and half. It wasn&#x27;t amazing, but not terrible either. Definitely doesn&#x27;t last a full 24 hours, maybe about 8-10 on me. Had to reapply occasionally. It goes on rather smooth to me, much like traditional invisible solids. The Ocean scent is pleasant, not overpowering, but enough to counteract your body smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once my PrimalPitPaste arrived, I started to use that. They warn of detoxing a lot as well, which I basically skipped using the Geodeo. I used the PPP in Patchouli for about 2 weeks and found that the PPP did not counteract smell as well as the Geodeo!&lt;br /&gt;I have since switched back to using Geodeo regularly, and will use PPP on my lazy days.&lt;br /&gt;Sidenote: I also purchased from PPP their Primer spray, which is basically witchhazel and essential oils, and that is pretty much amazing! The combo of the primer and natural deodorant is a WIN.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With extended natural deodorant use, your body is supposed to smell less on it&#x27;s own, I feel this is true. The hardest part is the initial &amp;#34;detox&amp;#34; and getting used to actually FEELING yourself sweat. But, sweating, while gross, is good for you!</li>
            <li> I like this deodorant. It smells nice, is natural, and the scent lasts all day. This is important to me especially because I go from a shop setting to a corporate office setting many times during the day and want to smell my best when I&#x27;m in front of the CEO.</li>
            <li> Best natural deodorant I&#x27;ve used... and I&#x27;ve used a lot. Of course this is not antiperspirant as there is no aluminum in it. It is also cruelty-free and vegan. I&#x27;ve also used their Island scent which is really good too but being a fella I tend to stick with this scent.&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s a link that might help some folk: http://vegangr.com/2013/05/smell-ya-later/</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work at all. Gave it a month and still does not work. Actually smells worse. Reapplying didn&#x27;t help either. Waste of money.</li>
            <li> I purchased this deodorant after seeing an advertisement for the product. I like the fact that it does not contain toxins, which was the biggest reason I bought it. The deodorant smells good, but but it has more of a manly scent to it than I would&#x27;ve guessed. That didn&#x27;t bother me because I am married and I gave it to my husband so it wasn&#x27;t wasted. I used the product once and I didn&#x27;t have any sensitivity as I sometimes do with other products. The deodorant worked ok, but didn&#x27;t last very long. My husband also has a hard time finding a deodorant that is easy on his armpits and this deodorant was great for him in that respect as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave this a 4 star rating because it is a deodorant, but you must reapply to keep things fresh!</li>
            <li> let me just start out by saying this ANY Geodeo deodorant is AMAZING. Any will get the job done by keeping down perspiration and being a great natural product. this scent in particular though is no doubt for men because it has a man-smelling smell. but a GREAT man smell. nothing strong and hard, but a light decent &amp;#34;im-a-guy&amp;#34; smell. it&#x27;s hard to explain, but it&#x27;s good. however the other smell Island, is more fruity and girly, yet as a man, probably prefer that one because I just love those kind of smells more. yet the smell quickly wears off, which is actually good because if you&#x27;re wearing a cologne/perfume, that wouldn&#x27;t be overpowered. maybe in the future i&#x27;ll just get the unscented and not worry about it, but all-in-all; what a fantastic deodorant! beats all other anti-perspiration drug store deodorants..</li>
            <li> As i use this more, i find i need deodorant less and less.  Glad I made the switch</li>
            <li> Thought this might actually work but it doesn&#x27;t do much to keep you fresh during the day. Severely disappointed. I remain on the hunt for a working natural deodorant.</li>
    </ol>
