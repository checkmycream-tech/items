            <li>Great buy!!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a great buy!</li>
            <li>My finger and toe nails will always look great moving forward - no excuses!</li>
            <li>Great nail drill!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s awesome</li>
            <li>I just started doing acrylic nails and let me say it does wonders, I really loved it!  </li>
            <li>Others mileage may vary lol</li>
            <li>Great drill</li>
            <li>I just don&#x27;t want to sit in the nail salon and this will come in handy for sure!!!</li>
            <li>To be fair, the FootSmart when I got it years agon was about $40</li>
            <li>This will do for now and the price was good and</li>
            <li>Not as amazing as I wanted it to be.</li>
            <li>I have been doing my own nails for over 20yrs.  </li>
            <li>The body gets a bit warm during use, if, say you use it a bit like I did trying to reduce some thickened nails.</li>
            <li>Would be nice if it came in a nice storage box rather than the cardboard box and plastic insert.</li>
            <li>Great product works great easy to use shipped fast.</li>
            <li>Very handy for a quick fix on your nails when you don&#x27;t have time to run to the salon.</li>
            <li>Works great and worth the value.&lt;br /&gt;I bought a fill-in kit for those weeks</li>
            <li>It arrived on time, it&#x27;s pretty good, it works well, doesn&#x27;t make much noise, it is perfect for the price</li>
            <li>Does the job just fine!</li>
            <li>I LOVE</li>
            <li>Powerful instrument, loved the accessories.</li>
            <li>An angle plug would be better at securing the cord to the drill.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Attachments are easy to change</li>
            <li>It comes with some nice diamond tips, and I was also able to put my older &amp;#34;FootSmart&amp;#34; bits into it since I was using it on my feet.</li>
            <li>say on your feet comfortably.</li>
            <li>but the receptacle looks like it is cheap aluminum (if you take the ring collar off and look at the insides).</li>
            <li>i haven&#x27;t had no problems with this so far so good..</li>
            <li>long sooo you get what you pay for lol</li>
            <li>Received in good time good price and just the same as the ones I have seen only for more money to do the same thing.</li>
            <li>the only thing that I would liked</li>
            <li>RIGHT AWAY</li>
            <li>This didn&#x27;t work right out-of-the-box.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I went to Sally&#x27;s beauty supply, spent a little more, and now I have a great drill.</li>
            <li>At first I wasn&#x27;t so convinced on buying it.</li>
            <li>It really does work!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s if it had a longer power cord,  but other than that I love it!</li>
            <li>The speed is easily adjusted and what really determines how it removes my old gel nail polish.</li>
            <li>The adjustable speed is just a wheel switch and for me it seems like two speeds, when it first turns on, kinda low power and then pretty much full on.</li>
            <li>Really works well.</li>
            <li>Makes it so much easier to remove gels</li>
            <li>So its powerful enough without getting hot.</li>
            <li>It is made in China and the power cord is pretty short so one would need an extension cord really to use it</li>
            <li>Maybe I should have done a little more research but the cord was ridiculously short.</li>
            <li>I mean it is ok.</li>
            <li>The brush heads don&#x27;t really file down as fast as I would like.</li>
            <li>At least the &amp;#34;bits&amp;#34; are in a case but even that case is not an easy open design</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Could not believe the power!  I have been doing my own nails for over 20yrs.  Every time I purchase a hand held drill, it never works with enough power to actually file the nail tip.  This tool, I actually had to turn the power down.  Totally in shock. Great buy!!</li>
            <li> Received item and it did not work very big disappointment. Sent back</li>
            <li> Received in good time good price and just the same as the ones I have seen only for more money to do the same thing.</li>
            <li> THE PACKAGE CAME ON TIME  EVERYTHING WAS THERE I USE IT RIGHT AWAY I LOVE IT  WORK  JUST LIKE THE SALON U SHOULD REALY GET THIS VICKYY ;0)</li>
            <li> Powerful instrument, loved the accessories.</li>
            <li> I got it and am very sad to say that it does not work at all. Won&#x27;t even turn on. Very disappointed. Am sending back.</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for! I mean it is ok. It is made in China and the power cord is pretty short so one would need an extension cord really to use it say on your feet comfortably. The power adapter plugs straight into the back making it not extremely secure. An angle plug would be better at securing the cord to the drill. It works like a drill with a chuck type device that you loosen in order to put your &amp;#34;bits&amp;#34; into the tip. The adjustable speed is just a wheel switch and for me it seems like two speeds, when it first turns on, kinda low power and then pretty much full on. Others mileage may vary lol The body gets a bit warm during use, if, say you use it a bit like I did trying to reduce some thickened nails. It comes with some nice diamond tips, and I was also able to put my older &amp;#34;FootSmart&amp;#34; bits into it since I was using it on my feet. They were a slight bit thicker shank but it accepted them quite well but the receptacle looks like it is cheap aluminum (if you take the ring collar off and look at the insides). But, it works! Would be nice if it came in a nice storage box rather than the cardboard box and plastic insert. At least the &amp;#34;bits&amp;#34; are in a case but even that case is not an easy open design but it does protect the diamond bits and the sanding covers. To be fair, the FootSmart when I got it years agon was about $40 and now I think they want around $100 for it but all I need is a replacement drill. This will do for now and the price was good and a few improvements I would give it4 or 5 stars. But I feel it won&#x27;t last long sooo you get what you pay for lol</li>
            <li> It arrived on time, it&#x27;s pretty good, it works well, doesn&#x27;t make much noise, it is perfect for the price</li>
            <li> Great drill but the charger kept falling out and it was really annoying constantly putting the cord back in.</li>
            <li> Not as amazing as I wanted it to be. The brush heads don&#x27;t really file down as fast as I would like.</li>
            <li> Love it. Once I figured out how to put drill together it files like a pro.</li>
            <li> Does the job just fine!</li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t work right out-of-the-box.&lt;br /&gt;It didn&#x27;t spin, it just buzzed. I only gave it one star because at least one is required.  I went to Sally&#x27;s beauty supply, spent a little more, and now I have a great drill.</li>
            <li> i haven&#x27;t had no problems with this so far so good..</li>
            <li> Really works well. The speed is easily adjusted and what really determines how it removes my old gel nail polish. Makes it so much easier to remove gels</li>
            <li> Works great and worth the value.&lt;br /&gt;I bought a fill-in kit for those weeks I just don&#x27;t want to sit in the nail salon and this will come in handy for sure!!! It&#x27;s speed adjustable and I used it already to shorten my nails from medium  to sporty length. So its powerful enough without getting hot. Attachments are easy to change it&#x27;s a great buy! My finger and toe nails will always look great moving forward - no excuses!</li>
            <li> Very handy for a quick fix on your nails when you don&#x27;t have time to run to the salon.</li>

            <li> Great product works great easy to use shipped fast. Would buy again</li>
            <li> Great nail drill!  It&#x27;s awesome the only thing that I would liked it&#x27;s if it had a longer power cord,  but other than that I love it!</li>
