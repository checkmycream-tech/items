            <li>I love how this product smells</li>
            <li>&gt; I absolutely love Kenra products, but this one isn&#x27;t working for</li>
            <li>Do I need say more?</li>
            <li>Their Platinum line of shampoos and conditioners are top notch too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However....</li>

            <li>Love the product but the nozzle does not work.  </li>
            <li>Love Kenra products.</li>
            <li>:) Every girl needs this in her life.</li>
            <li>I love this silkening mist.  </li>
            <li>I love the spray.  </li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I wish I loved it, I really do.&lt;br</li>
            <li>- you don&#x27;t need much, so go easy.  </li>
            <li>Of course it did not and stayed strong all day.  </li>
            <li>It leaves your hair shiny, silky, and smooth feeling.  </li>
            <li>Worked well, but I could not handle the cheap strawberry scent.  </li>
            <li>Kenra used to have a spray on mist that made my hair so smooth and silky, unlike anything else.</li>
            <li>The smell is fabulous.</li>
            <li>I should have one for every location I&#x27;m at-since I am always in and out-which means coats on and off and hats, ect, so my hair does get static often, but this has really helped!</li>
            <li>I love the smell and it makes my hair look so pretty</li>
            <li>I love it so much!</li>
            <li>Now I have a full can and can&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li>I LOVE the smell of this product, and it has softened my hair, but it doesn&#x27;t really control frizz for me.  </li>
            <li>Well worth the price.</li>
            <li>after countless other products that claim this.....Kenra is the best.  </li>
            <li>Simply amazing product for dry, damaged hair.</li>
            <li>Makes my hair thick hair silky and smell great.</li>
            <li>Not sad I ordered but just does not work like I thought it would .</li>
            <li>Gives hair a soft, silky, light texture.</li>
            <li>Love how this product works with a flat iron</li>
            <li>Im sure this will last forever even as much as i use it.   </li>
            <li>/&gt;The truth is that the smell is so powerful and sweet, it smells like a teenage girl&#x27;s perfume overload.</li>
            <li>I have long thick hair and this stuff is awesome!</li>
            <li>Love the smell, just be careful not to use too much.</li>
            <li>Not used a hair spray, a styling tool really</li>
            <li>It was much cheaper than in the salon.</li>
            <li>Maybe a bit of shine, but for how much this costs?</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just a shame, really.</li>
            <li>Product as described and fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Will find a real retailer elsewhere.</li>
            <li>Good for dry hair &amp; when the ends are dry.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t live without this stuff.  </li>
            <li>I cant live without it now</li>
            <li>I have fine hair, so a lot of the shine products on the market tend to weigh my hair down.  </li>
            <li>Most hair product stinks, but I really enjoy this smell.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li>leaves my hair soft, silky and shiny whether I wear it naturally curly or straighten it.  </li>
            <li>After she was done I asked her what made my hair feel so wonderfully soft, and ever since then I&#x27;ve used this product (and I used to NEVER use anything in my hair, not even</li>
            <li>This makes my hair feel and look so soft and</li>
            <li>This spray is very lightweight and makes your blonde hair glisten like it has gold in it!!  </li>
            <li>My hair is very unmanageable, and I have tried SEVERAL products with the goal of having a salon end result.</li>
            <li>I have ordered three cans thus far.  </li>
            <li>It also makes it shiny and soft.  </li>
            <li>My hair is soft and shiny and healthier than ever.</li>
            <li>this product left a huge mess in my fresh washed hair, there was nothing silkening about it, 1 hour later it was either dried up or when I used a bit more it made it wet looking.</li>
            <li>but I can&#x27;t really see the shine I expected.</li>
            <li>For this price, you would expect they have a packaging solution that doesn&#x27;t ruin the outside of the bottle, but that&#x27;s exactly what they did, making this completely unusable in a salon setting or even at home unless you want a black sticky residue on everything and the finish peeling off because of the tape they used.</li>
            <li>Key, is don&#x27;t use too much, it will make your hair weigh down too much and leave it long and stringy.</li>

            <li> I would not trust any other source then a professional salon that offer Kenra.</li>
            <li> I use a decent amount because I have quite a bit of hair, but this can still lasts me a few months.</li>
            <li> flat iron</li>
            <li> I use it after flat ironing my frizzy hair and it makes it feel as if my hair dresser just got done stying it.</li>
            <li> Lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Just a few sprays does the trick and leaves it so soft.</li>
            <li> I wish I had found this a long time ago.  </li>
            <li> I have thin, fine, limp hair.</li>
            <li> me.&lt;br /&gt;I find myself holding this product in one hand, and Garnier Sleek and Shine Sleek Finish 5-In-1 Serum Spray for Sleek Finish in the other (the one I&#x27;ve had forever), and always ending up choosing the latter.</li>
            <li> I am sold and committed to it for as long as it continues to provide those results for me!</li>
            <li> and it make my dull course hair look vibrant and shiny,</li>
            <li> It never leaves my hair feeling sticky or dry.  </li>
            <li> Actually brings out tones and highlights in hair without making it weighted down or sticky.</li>
            <li> I use it sparingly, a little for me goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to get my hands sticky like other products.</li>
            <li> This product gives you shine without weighing down your hair.</li>
            <li> Doesnt weigh your hair down or make it look/feel greasy.</li>
            <li> Helps to keep the frizzies down.</li>
            <li> I would not consider this a hairspray because it doesn&#x27;t make the hair stiff or hold it in place.</li>
            <li> This product smooths my hair without making it stiff.  </li>
            <li> so not sure how Amazon is offering it.  </li>
            <li> After styling I spray a small amount into my hair.  </li>
            <li> I am not sure if this is the equivalent or not.</li>
            <li> I have used the silkening drops in the past.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find a shine spray for your hair.</li>
            <li> When I got the product they did not have a cap on the canister it got sprayed in the box because there was oil spots in the box extremely unhappy.</li>
            <li> It made me sick.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>

            <li> I love this product!!  I have fine hair, so a lot of the shine products on the market tend to weigh my hair down.  Not this one!  I love it ... leaves my hair soft, silky and shiny whether I wear it naturally curly or straighten it.  I can&#x27;t live without this stuff.  I have ordered this product from this seller a few times now, and the shipping speed is always incredibly fast.  Love the product ... love the service!</li>
            <li> My daughter, the recipient is very pleased</li>
            <li> LOVE this product. I am also a fan of B&amp;B and Aveda, but thought I would give this a try. Wonderful. Good for dry hair &amp; when the ends are dry. Not used a hair spray, a styling tool really</li>
            <li> This product is Great for gray hair - it give your hair a wonderful shine - you don&#x27;t need much, so go easy.  It was much cheaper than in the salon.</li>
            <li> I love how this product smells and I like using it but I can&#x27;t really see the shine I expected.</li>
            <li> I had a hair trim in a salon and the stylist sprayed this on my hair. After she was done I asked her what made my hair feel so wonderfully soft, and ever since then I&#x27;ve used this product (and I used to NEVER use anything in my hair, not even hair spray!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are some of the great things about this spray:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. It smells good! Most hair product stinks, but I really enjoy this smell.&lt;br /&gt;2. Softer hair! This makes my hair feel and look so soft and sleek!&lt;br /&gt;3. Detangler! My hair tangles from the slightest gust of wind. This plus a straightener keeps my hair from tangling quite as much.&lt;br /&gt;4. Lasts a long time. I use a decent amount because I have quite a bit of hair, but this can still lasts me a few months.</li>
            <li> I wish I loved it, I really do.&lt;br /&gt;The truth is that the smell is so powerful and sweet, it smells like a teenage girl&#x27;s perfume overload. I don&#x27;t like it.&lt;br /&gt;Also, it doen&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s &amp;#34;silkening&amp;#34; anything. Maybe a bit of shine, but for how much this costs? I don&#x27;t know.&lt;br /&gt; I absolutely love Kenra products, but this one isn&#x27;t working for me.&lt;br /&gt;I find myself holding this product in one hand, and Garnier Sleek and Shine Sleek Finish 5-In-1 Serum Spray for Sleek Finish in the other (the one I&#x27;ve had forever), and always ending up choosing the latter. It&#x27;s just a shame, really.</li>
            <li> I use this after each day of styling my hair...the finishing touch to a great hair day....My hairdresser also uses this product on me..</li>
            <li> Product as described and fast shipping.</li>
            <li> This was my second purchase of this product.  I&#x27;m very happy with it and will continue to use it.  It&#x27;s a hair spray that adds gloss and smells good.</li>
            <li> Its Kenra.  Do I need say more? this product smells so good and adds a great shine to my hair whether i go curly or straight.  Im sure this will last forever even as much as i use it.   Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Loved the spray, but after 5-6 times using it stopped spraying.  Now I have a full can and can&#x27;t use it. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> This product is truly weightless.....after countless other products that claim this.....Kenra is the best.  It makes my hair dazzle w shine, softens, and smells great.  Their Platinum line of shampoos and conditioners are top notch too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However....according to Kenra&#x27;s website their products are sold ONLY thru salons....so not sure how Amazon is offering it.  I would not trust any other source then a professional salon that offer Kenra.</li>
            <li> My hairstylist recommended this product.I have long thick hair and this stuff is awesome! Will definitely buy this again.</li>
            <li> Love my Kenra products and thrilled I can get them on Amazon!</li>
            <li> This spray is very lightweight and makes your blonde hair glisten like it has gold in it!!  I love this product!!</li>
            <li> I LOVE the smell of this product, and it has softened my hair, but it doesn&#x27;t really control frizz for me.  Also, the glitter on the cap came peeling and constantly comes off on my hands.  I think I&#x27;ll try something else next time.</li>
            <li> I have been using Kenra Silkening Mist for over five years and it is the only finishing product I will use on my hair.  It never leaves my hair feeling sticky or dry.  I use it sparingly, a little for me goes a long way.  After styling I spray a small amount into my hair.  If it feels good to you don&#x27;t use more.  It leaves your hair shiny, silky, and smooth feeling.  I would not consider this a hairspray because it doesn&#x27;t make the hair stiff or hold it in place.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  I spray it before I flat iron and it make my dull course hair look vibrant and shiny, plus I love the way it smells!</li>
            <li> Love love love this product!!! I have thin, fine, limp hair. This product gives you shine without weighing down your hair. I will continue to buy this over &amp; over!</li>
            <li> When I got the product they did not have a cap on the canister it got sprayed in the box because there was oil spots in the box extremely unhappy.</li>
            <li> Awesome product!! My hair is very unmanageable, and I have tried SEVERAL products with the goal of having a salon end result. Nothing has ever resulted in that manner UNTIL i tried this product. I love love love the results. I am sold and committed to it for as long as it continues to provide those results for me! Thanks.</li>
            <li> Enjoyed my product. Thanks</li>
            <li> Great price and makes your hair shiny.</li>
            <li> I love this product and smell. Makes my hair thick hair silky and smell great. I don&#x27;t have to get my hands sticky like other products. I can just spray and go. I am on my second bottle.</li>
            <li> This product you can by all over but on amazon it is the best price you will find anywhere.. it is also the best silkening mist you can buy that leaves your hair shiny silky and healthy I have used it for years all my family loves it also</li>
            <li> this product left a huge mess in my fresh washed hair, there was nothing silkening about it, 1 hour later it was either dried up or when I used a bit more it made it wet looking. Also did not care for the smell</li>
            <li> This product is all it promises to be and more.  At last I have a silky sheen to my hair, at just the touch of a button.  No oiliness but a great effect.&lt;br /&gt;Gramcrackergran, CA</li>
            <li> Worked well, but I could not handle the cheap strawberry scent.  It made me sick.  I did not have time to wash it out and thought it might diffuse after a while.  Of course it did not and stayed strong all day.  I threw the spray away after using it once.</li>
            <li> Kenra used to have a spray on mist that made my hair so smooth and silky, unlike anything else. I am not sure if this is the equivalent or not. But it is quite good. -)</li>
            <li> Love the product but the nozzle does not work.  Can&#x27;t retrieve product.</li>
            <li> Love Kenra products. The smell is fabulous. My hair belongs to Kenra! Just do yourself a favor and buy it!</li>
            <li> This is a product that was introduced to me on the Today Show.  I have ordered three cans thus far.  I found the product to do what it says it will do...makes your hair shiney.</li>
            <li> I buy this hairspray regularly. I have for years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smells like strawberry, tames fly aways, and gives your hair a gorgeous shine and lustre</li>
            <li> This is an excellent hair shine.  Has a very pleasant smell.  This item is very light weight on the hair.  Makes you hair look and smell beautiful.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy this product. For this price, you would expect they have a packaging solution that doesn&#x27;t ruin the outside of the bottle, but that&#x27;s exactly what they did, making this completely unusable in a salon setting or even at home unless you want a black sticky residue on everything and the finish peeling off because of the tape they used. Will find a real retailer elsewhere.</li>
            <li> Very happy with this product. I should have one for every location I&#x27;m at-since I am always in and out-which means coats on and off and hats, ect, so my hair does get static often, but this has really helped! I love the smell and it makes my hair look so pretty :) Every girl needs this in her life.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great. Softens your hair and smells like strawberries. I use it after flat ironing my frizzy hair and it makes it feel as if my hair dresser just got done stying it. I&#x27;ve been using it for years. Key, is don&#x27;t use too much, it will make your hair weigh down too much and leave it long and stringy. Just a few sprays does the trick and leaves it so soft.</li>
            <li> Not sad I ordered but just does not work like I thought it would . I just would not order this again.</li>
            <li> really a good product.... good shine and brushes out easily at the end of the day- price was spot on</li>
            <li> My hair dresser uses it on me and I always get compliments when I use it.  It protects the hair from heat and smells like strawberries yet it compliments your perfume.  My daughter loves it.</li>
            <li> Great for fine hair. Doesnt weigh your hair down or make it look/feel greasy. Perfect shine and you dont lose the volume!</li>
            <li> I have used the silkening drops in the past.  Received a sample from my hair sytlist and loved it! Amazon had it a great price! Love the smell, just be careful not to use too much.</li>
            <li> Simply amazing product for dry, damaged hair. Gives hair a soft, silky, light texture. Boost shine also. I cant live without it now and I have tried tons of straightening products.</li>
            <li> This product smooths my hair without making it stiff.  It also makes it shiny and soft.  It is an awesome product.</li>
            <li> I love this silkening mist.  And always get compliments on the shiny completed look.  Thanks for Kenra great products!  betty</li>
            <li> I love the spray.  It makes my hair shine and look great.  I wish I had found this a long time ago.  People notice the shine in my hair.</li>
            <li> This works so well on my hair without being greasy. I use it almost every day.  I love it so much!</li>
            <li> Great Product, Perfect Seller A+</li>
            <li> Love how this product works with a flat iron</li>
            <li> This product was recommended to me by my stylist and it&#x27;s lived up to the expectations I had.  My hair is soft and shiny and healthier than ever.</li>
            <li> Helps to keep the frizzies down. Actually brings out tones and highlights in hair without making it weighted down or sticky. Love this stuff. Well worth the price.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find a shine spray for your hair. This is the perfect one, I promise. I&#x27;m a hair guru and this will NOT disappoint!</li>
