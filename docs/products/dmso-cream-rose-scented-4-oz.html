            <li>but the cream has a good consistency and was promptly delivered.  </li>

            <li>I love this stuff and it&#x27;s great for dealing with pain or scar tissue reduction.</li>
            <li>We all are very pleased with the cream and how it helps with sore joints.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Smells amazing, feels good on ailments</li>
            <li>Very pleased but the fragrance is stronger than I like.</li>
            <li>If you need DMSO cream, this smells good, massages in quickly and is a good size for travel!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>This product is amazing for eliminating muscle and joint pains..</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is amazing</li>
            <li>It works great on my aches and pains and it also provides your body with the needed oxygen that our bodies need to fight off free radicals that damage our bodies.</li>
            <li>This product is amazing.  </li>
            <li>Plus it has rose &amp;#34;scent&amp;#34;, which is yet another chemical.</li>
            <li>and it does go on nicely and works.  </li>
            <li>use the rose cream or Dr. Jacobs lab grade</li>
            <li>The product does smell like rose.  </li>
            <li>My skin is irritated by the gel version, but not this Rose</li>
            <li>I think it is somewhat effective in relieving arthritis pain</li>
            <li>Love the product so many uses and it works great.  </li>
            <li>She also liked the rose scent..</li>
            <li>the rose scent could not overpower the dmso scent.i will not buy this again.</li>
            <li>The rose scent does take care of the odor problem, in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It soaks in well and is pleasantly rose scented.  </li>
            <li>Also nice cream consistency.</li>
            <li>Life is so much more enjoyable since I discovered Rose Scented DMSO Cream!  </li>
            <li>I will however try the gel DMSO to see if it&#x27;s any better then the rose scented.</li>
            <li>I buy a lot of dmso,  rose scented is ok ,  </li>
            <li>The liquid DMSO seems to work better for me but the liquid stuff doesnt smell as nice as this one.</li>
            <li>The most effective pain relief for my arthritis pain.  </li>
            <li>dmso is amazing, worked much better than I had hoped for</li>
            <li>A veterinarian friend of mine said that humans have used dmso for years with great success</li>
            <li>I have utilized the DMSO Cream Rose Scented item for many years by now.  </li>
            <li>Easy transaction and would buy from again!  </li>
            <li>I do Very Sincerely Thank You for my very long term recite of this DMSO Cream Rose Scented Product !!!!   </li>
            <li>I will continue for the full 6 weeks to be fair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very light and does smell like roses.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very smooth silky cream that moisturizes, exfoliates and penetrates the skin.  </li>
            <li>so long I&#x27;m sure the DSMO is helping and the rose smell is very pleasant.</li>
            <li>I will be buying more of this....</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>The sooner applied after injury the better</li>
            <li>Love this cream...</li>
            <li>so many benefits from DMSO.</li>
            <li>Most people simply endure skin problems thinking there can be no relief, this works wonderfully.</li>
            <li>Love the scent too.</li>
            <li>of course, the price is quite a bit more</li>
            <li>and I was able to start playing again.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>I will order more.</li>
            <li>DMSO Cream did not seem as effective and is as smooth to put on.</li>
            <li>The smell of the DMSO itself is mostly masked by the fragrance in the cream, but it is still there - thus 4 stars.</li>
            <li>like the light rose smell.  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure if I should use this or not, but it does work.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s more like menthol.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s really magic..</li>
            <li>This is a much better value.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad she did.</li>
            <li>For sure it works better than anything else I have tried.</li>
            <li>Be sure to study up on DMSO and read the reviews.</li>
            <li>We love this oxygenated cream.</li>
            <li>It could use more instructions on use.</li>
            <li>It is okay.</li>
            <li>there are many uses for this cream.</li>
            <li>I am always pleased with this product for my arthritis.</li>
            <li>No awful smell</li>
            <li>Awesome stuff mixed with oregano oil for anti inflammatory bliss.</li>
            <li>We both love the relief we get from DMSO.</li>
            <li>DMSO is under appreciated and it is a wonderful product worth doing the research on.</li>
            <li>but the system said I needed 9 more words.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many products but nothing has come close to the effectiveness of this product.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Do make sure you have washed the area before using though.</li>
            <li>If I wasn&#x27;t completely satisfied I wouldn&#x27;t continue to order it.</li>
            <li>Will have to make sure I keep this around the house.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s ok to use it.</li>
            <li>I do Sincerely Thank You,  Ron Folian</li>
            <li>It was on me about 6 to 7 hours before I have to put more on.</li>
            <li>I love it the way it does the pain.</li>
            <li>According to what I have read, we all need more minerals now days because of depletion of our soils.</li>
            <li>I love the product.</li>
            <li>The cream is a lot better than the gel.</li>
            <li>A must have for any medicine cabinet or first aide kit!!!</li>
            <li>my son ,so far so good very satisfied..</li>
            <li>The rose improves it, but it really just smells like turpentine plus rose.</li>
            <li>Good scent to the product -- masks its natural odor effectively.  </li>
            <li>Never live without it!&lt;br /&gt;Perfect for every boo-boo out there and superb on burns!!!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Every one, who is suffering from headaches, muscle cramps, frozen shoulders issues, join pain and many other health issues, buy this cream, which will save your money on pills, doctor&#x27;s office visits and makes you happy!</li>
            <li>this was the fourth order for this product, very good, it works for me.</li>
            <li>On the downside, I&#x27;m personally not crazy for the rose scent, as it tends to make me a bit nauseous.  </li>
            <li>I have used this among other brands for my arthritis and have found that Topricin and Penetrex works the best.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;m so happy that the cream goes on and is absorbed so much faster than the gel.</li>
            <li>When applied it didn&#x27;t rub into the skin easy.</li>
            <li>Because I liked the movie so much and have watched it more than once.</li>
            <li>This one goes on easily and has no odor and is easy to apply.  </li>
            <li>I rubbed this cream on it, and whamooo, no bruise ( and I bruise easy).  </li>
            <li>I strongly recommend DMSO.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The scent is a bit too strong for me, but so it goes.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t use industrial strength as it causes rashes as it is too strong.</li>
            <li>Very strong odor that takes some getting used to but worth it.</li>
            <li>I liked the cream very much, A friend told me about the cream and</li>
            <li>I&#x27; been using the rose cream since it first came out because</li>
            <li>RECOMMEND TO EVERYONE!&lt;br /&gt;ABSOLUTELY  SUPER CREAM!  </li>
            <li>Thank you for the quick delivery!</li>
            <li>My husband uses the rose scented and I purchased the large non-scented because I like to use</li>
            <li>The Dmso hslped our back pain problem greatly.</li>
            <li>Take a look at DMSO, as this is a fantastic product.</li>
            <li>and my skin stays smooth.  </li>
            <li>use lightly .</li>
            <li>Worked great to provide instant pain relief on my knee.</li>
            <li>I want to explore more of it&#x27;s healing properties, esp since I have found good back pain relief with MSM (sulfer), which is made from DMSO.</li>
            <li>This stuff works really good on many different ailments.</li>
            <li>One good source is the company started by the medical Doctor that helped so many patients with DMSO therapy - Dr. Stanley Jacob.</li>
            <li>So anyway, thanks for such a great product!</li>
            <li>But as one person said &amp;#34;horses won&#x27;t run if they hurt&amp;#34; so I originally got the stuff from the feed store and it works just fine.  </li>
            <li>Guess I have to be more consistent.</li>
            <li>The rose scent covers the normal stench of the DMSO.</li>
            <li>I use it mixed with Arnica cream, so effective!</li>
            <li>I just went through my first jar and ordered two more.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my wife and it significantly relieved her pain from arthritis</li>
            <li>good news is that real Medical Grade (or Laboratory Grade) DMSO is readily available.</li>
            <li>I find that the rose scented cream eliminates this situation for me, and the rose scent is very light and delicate.</li>
            <li>I have used it for years to help heal various injuries, always with good results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Also no bad taste.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Just make certain that your skin is very clean when you apply the DMSO, as it will carry along with it anything else that is on your skin.  </li>
            <li>Other than that concern, great product.</li>
            <li>Dissipates quickly though.</li>
            <li>and we are healed quickly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been putting it in my neck, as I have mild arthritis and steno-sis and often have neck pain or awaken with headaches.</li>
            <li>WORKS TREMENDOUSLY WELL.</li>
            <li>I am so glad this is back on the market and available to all of us!  </li>
            <li>This product did, the very first night I used it.  </li>
            <li>Dmso is a great pain reliever and will remove a bruise in half the time that nature can.</li>
            <li>This was delivered on time, was exactly what I was expecting, and is working as desired!</li>
            <li>This particular brand has a nice fragrance as DMSO normally has a garlicky smell.</li>
            <li>It is not 100% effective and it is not instant but it works probably 85% to 90% at relieving discomfort.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s definitely worth a try.</li>
            <li>I have been using the Penetrex only and have not yet tried the DMSO Rose Sentented cream.  </li>
            <li>but, if one can afford it, well worth it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m being honest yet keeping an open mind.</li>
            <li>I have used DMSO for nearly 3 years, and have been incredibly pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m not a big fan of rose scent, but</li>
            <li>We purchased this to treat my husband&#x27;s hand for a rare infection (as yet not diagnosed conclusively - whether bacterial or fungal.  </li>
            <li>For 20 dollars it is a chance worth the risk.</li>
            <li>That means the rose fragrance is being absorbed deep into your skin.</li>
            <li>and it goes right away.</li>
            <li>Instead of taking a pill which travels throughout the body, this stuff goes right to the source.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is my second time ordering this product it works very well for joints and aches very pleased</li>
            <li>The fda frowns on treatments that are cheap and effective and readily available (takes money away from big pharamceutical companies)  and if the distributor  labeled it for human issues</li>
            <li>The rose scented DMSO smells strongly of roses, but no garlic or stinky smell like the plain gel.</li>
            <li>this cream really works, I recommend this product to anyone!</li>
            <li>I am aware of it&#x27;s ability to transport whatever is on your skin into your bloodstream.</li>
            <li>Sure in off the next day was gone</li>
            <li>Stick to hot compress or heating pad.</li>
            <li>I first learned about DMSO when I worked at Portland Meadows in 1962.</li>
            <li>I use it daily as I drive for many hours and me legs hurt from clutch pressing and gas pedal pressing and</li>
            <li>I have not used it enough to say more.</li>
            <li>I am aware of the placebo effect</li>
            <li>heal much much much faster!</li>
            <li>We will know more as time passes about the final results of it&#x27;s use.</li>
            <li>They know exactly what they are doing, especially with the cute tree logo and the fact that they market to health food</li>
            <li>I have not found that DMSO offered any more relief than MSM creams that are made for human use.  </li>
            <li>Regardless, while it has a nice fragrance, it had absolutely no discernable effect when applying to my wife&#x27;s arthiritic shoulder.  </li>
            <li>I will be buying more when I get low.  </li>
            <li>His legs look pretty good now and it took a few weeks to heal the sores.</li>
            <li>This stuff also helped his legs not hurt and he slept all night through the first night</li>
            <li>So far don&#x27;t see significant impact</li>
            <li>makes the pain pretty much</li>
            <li>Used it for several years and it helps more than most other pain relief creams and lotions.</li>
            <li>This is better than any icy hot or arthritis creams etc.  </li>
            <li>, it is so pure that there is no noticeable odor.  </li>
            <li>so i am ordering pure liquid dmso.</li>
            <li>For example, if you want to push more B12 into your bloodstream, it can be crushed &amp; dissolved into DMSO</li>
            <li>It works fast.  </li>
            <li>To much cream maybe?</li>
            <li>Thank you so much.</li>
            <li>This stuff really works-it&#x27;s the bomb---------I&#x27;d</li>
            <li>let everyone know it&#x27;s the real deal&lt;</li>
            <li>Fast delivery.</li>
            <li>While it is not a miracle cream, it does take the edge off the intense pain.</li>
            <li>I really wanted it to work.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The product works very well for both of us.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have to go to the chiropractor as much when I use this product.</li>
            <li>The easing affect which follows is where the real benefit arrives.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>It works very well.</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t work very well</li>
            <li>Since this cream takes whatever non-oil on your skin directly into your blood stream, the iodine is immediately absorbed.  </li>
            <li>and I really was please with it.</li>
            <li>Still researching whether you can put too much DMSO in your system through creams or IV.</li>
            <li>horses\\&quot; (wink..they didnt really have horses).  </li>
            <li>she also confirmed that this is labeled the way it is becuase of the FDA and not because its a different grade.</li>
            <li>It really works on pain.</li>
            <li>I have suffered with sore fingers and knee joint pain for several years, I even make my own lotion that does help, but I wake in the middle of the night sometimes to re apply the lotion.  </li>
            <li>The local health food store was out of this Rose Scented product, so I bought the gel by the same company.  </li>
            <li>A quick word about the rose scented cream is that DMSO can result in a slight garlic-like smell after several days of use.  </li>
            <li>Read other reviews for more specifics.</li>
            <li>the price was better than other websites.</li>
            <li>I use this daily and significantly improved my well being.</li>
            <li>ONLY USE ON CLEAN SURFACE.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised the first night I used it on my hands</li>
            <li>I have been sleeping better, my days are much less painful, and this wonderful product has really brightened my quality of life.  </li>
            <li>This cream is of high quality but being a man  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Can easily move my hands for driving, typing and other tasks--for the price, it cannot be beaten.</li>
            <li>I love it because it works and last a long time.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Bottom line, it helps my shoulder pain when Rx NSAID  pills would not, and the rose has no foul smell nor has it given me any negative reactions.  </li>
            <li>(I&#x27;ve scoured the net, watched videos, and I&#x27;m reading Dr. Morton Walker&#x27;s book on it right now)</li>
            <li>I do not choose to live without it.</li>
            <li>there is a new prescription called Pennsaid.  </li>
            <li>now with 11 dessicated Discs, one new one installed and severe  arthritis in both hands and spine  </li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m giving it a few more days for complete confirmation</li>
            <li>the cream goes on so smooth, no strong odor, very helpful for relieving the pain from my knees, hands and feet.  </li>
            <li>I tried DMSO for the first time and within a few days the muscle pain quickly went away.</li>
            <li>I usually use it in combination with another pain cream, layering the DMSO on top.  </li>
            <li>I am not sure how safe/ healthy that is.</li>
            <li>And it doesn&#x27;t not feel like your body real hot like some of the other cream you put on.  </li>
            <li>We are glad they have some scent to it, because plain DMSO smells pretty bad and we don&#x27;t love the rose scent, but it is a large improvement over plain.  </li>
            <li>Smells so much better than a plain one!</li>
            <li>Medical or pharmaceutical grade is truly 99% pure.</li>
            <li>(besides using pure hydrogen peroxide [35% food grade mixed with reverse osmosis process filtered water to equal pure 2% hydrogen peroxide)</li>
            <li>probably 30 minutes or so later I&#x27;ll realize I&#x27;m not in as much pain.</li>
            <li>I have used DMSO cream for years and often recommended it to others for soft tissue pain issues.</li>
            <li>It smells like old lady purfume.</li>
            <li>For years I have used the old time DMSO suffering with the smell and taste,  </li>
            <li>at 16 years old one application</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s all natural.</li>
            <li>So I am working with an old injury.  </li>
            <li>but she has my 20 year old daughter using it to after her work outs at the gym.  </li>
            <li>I have chronic Lyme, and the pain can be overwhelming, to say the least.  </li>
            <li>I am noticing some real improvement in neck pain and reduced headaches after about 3 days of putting it on daily.</li>
            <li>I like how it soaks in, but so far no relief.</li>
            <li>I am surprised at the people who do not know about DMSO.  </li>
            <li>I did some of the early research on it when it fwrst came out in the 1960s for use in Vet Medicine</li>
            <li>I think it has helped, although, the last time I used DMSO it really had a burning sensation.  </li>
            <li>He&#x27;s been sleeping a lot better lately.</li>
            <li>I have combined it with a larger proportion of the same firm&#x27;s Aloe Vera gel version of this product and thus reduced the rose scent to a bearable level.</li>
            <li>, I am still sick many days after, I do not think this is a reputable company</li>
            <li>Only takes a tiny amount &amp; really reduces pain &amp; stiffness in my knee &amp; finger joint for 4-6 hours.</li>
            <li>wife called them to ask what grade this is, since it isn&#x27;t marked on the container, and they said that the bottle is marked as not for human use, and that it is Industrial grade that they buy in 55 gallon containers.</li>
            <li>works great for me and does not smell bad.</li>
            <li>so if I ever get really bad muscle pains I&#x27;ll try it lol</li>
            <li>Works very well on long term back pain.  </li>
            <li>be careful not to drink too much  one ounce  </li>
            <li>Within a few weeks, I was back at full strength</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use it in large amounts at all, but if I get a cold sore coming on a dab the size of a q tip top 2 or 3 x</li>
            <li>Just place a little bit on the nape of your neck for 3 days at the first sign of a tingle.</li>
            <li>Also there is a new  company that promotes this product which has the active ingredient MSM and aloe  </li>

            <li> If you need DMSO cream, this smells good, massages in quickly and is a good size for travel!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> This product is amazing for eliminating muscle and joint pains..</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is amazing</li>
            <li> It works great on my aches and pains and it also provides your body with the needed oxygen that our bodies need to fight off free radicals that damage our bodies.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing.  </li>
            <li> Plus it has rose &amp;#34;scent&amp;#34;, which is yet another chemical.</li>
            <li> and it does go on nicely and works.  </li>
            <li> use the rose cream or Dr. Jacobs lab grade</li>
            <li> The product does smell like rose.  </li>
            <li> My skin is irritated by the gel version, but not this Rose</li>
            <li> I think it is somewhat effective in relieving arthritis pain</li>
            <li> Love the product so many uses and it works great.  </li>
            <li> She also liked the rose scent..</li>
            <li> the rose scent could not overpower the dmso scent.i will not buy this again.</li>
            <li> The rose scent does take care of the odor problem, in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It soaks in well and is pleasantly rose scented.  </li>
            <li> Also nice cream consistency.</li>
            <li> Life is so much more enjoyable since I discovered Rose Scented DMSO Cream!  </li>
            <li> I will however try the gel DMSO to see if it&#x27;s any better then the rose scented.</li>
            <li> I buy a lot of dmso,  rose scented is ok ,  </li>
            <li> The liquid DMSO seems to work better for me but the liquid stuff doesnt smell as nice as this one.</li>
            <li> The most effective pain relief for my arthritis pain.  </li>
            <li> dmso is amazing, worked much better than I had hoped for</li>
            <li> A veterinarian friend of mine said that humans have used dmso for years with great success</li>
            <li> I have utilized the DMSO Cream Rose Scented item for many years by now.  </li>
            <li> Easy transaction and would buy from again!  </li>
            <li> I do Very Sincerely Thank You for my very long term recite of this DMSO Cream Rose Scented Product !!!!   </li>
            <li> I will continue for the full 6 weeks to be fair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very light and does smell like roses.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very smooth silky cream that moisturizes, exfoliates and penetrates the skin.  </li>
            <li> so long I&#x27;m sure the DSMO is helping and the rose smell is very pleasant.</li>
            <li> I will be buying more of this....</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> The sooner applied after injury the better</li>
            <li> Love this cream...</li>
            <li> so many benefits from DMSO.</li>
            <li> Most people simply endure skin problems thinking there can be no relief, this works wonderfully.</li>
            <li> Love the scent too.</li>
            <li> of course, the price is quite a bit more</li>
            <li> and I was able to start playing again.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love it</li>
            <li> I will order more.</li>
            <li> DMSO Cream did not seem as effective and is as smooth to put on.</li>
            <li> The smell of the DMSO itself is mostly masked by the fragrance in the cream, but it is still there - thus 4 stars.</li>
            <li> like the light rose smell.  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure if I should use this or not, but it does work.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s more like menthol.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s really magic..</li>
            <li> This is a much better value.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad she did.</li>
            <li> For sure it works better than anything else I have tried.</li>
            <li> Be sure to study up on DMSO and read the reviews.</li>
            <li> We love this oxygenated cream.</li>
            <li> It could use more instructions on use.</li>
            <li> It is okay.</li>
            <li> there are many uses for this cream.</li>
            <li> I am always pleased with this product for my arthritis.</li>
            <li> No awful smell</li>
            <li> Awesome stuff mixed with oregano oil for anti inflammatory bliss.</li>
            <li> We both love the relief we get from DMSO.</li>
            <li> DMSO is under appreciated and it is a wonderful product worth doing the research on.</li>
            <li> but the system said I needed 9 more words.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many products but nothing has come close to the effectiveness of this product.  </li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Do make sure you have washed the area before using though.</li>
            <li> If I wasn&#x27;t completely satisfied I wouldn&#x27;t continue to order it.</li>
            <li> Will have to make sure I keep this around the house.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s ok to use it.</li>
            <li> I do Sincerely Thank You,  Ron Folian</li>
            <li> It was on me about 6 to 7 hours before I have to put more on.</li>
            <li> I love it the way it does the pain.</li>
            <li> According to what I have read, we all need more minerals now days because of depletion of our soils.</li>
            <li> I love the product.</li>
            <li> The cream is a lot better than the gel.</li>
            <li> A must have for any medicine cabinet or first aide kit!!!</li>
            <li> my son ,so far so good very satisfied..</li>
            <li> The rose improves it, but it really just smells like turpentine plus rose.</li>
            <li> Good scent to the product -- masks its natural odor effectively.  </li>
            <li> Never live without it!&lt;br /&gt;Perfect for every boo-boo out there and superb on burns!!!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Every one, who is suffering from headaches, muscle cramps, frozen shoulders issues, join pain and many other health issues, buy this cream, which will save your money on pills, doctor&#x27;s office visits and makes you happy!</li>
            <li> this was the fourth order for this product, very good, it works for me.</li>
            <li> On the downside, I&#x27;m personally not crazy for the rose scent, as it tends to make me a bit nauseous.  </li>
            <li> I have used this among other brands for my arthritis and have found that Topricin and Penetrex works the best.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m so happy that the cream goes on and is absorbed so much faster than the gel.</li>
            <li> When applied it didn&#x27;t rub into the skin easy.</li>
            <li> Because I liked the movie so much and have watched it more than once.</li>
            <li> This one goes on easily and has no odor and is easy to apply.  </li>
            <li> I rubbed this cream on it, and whamooo, no bruise ( and I bruise easy).  </li>
            <li> I strongly recommend DMSO.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The scent is a bit too strong for me, but so it goes.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t use industrial strength as it causes rashes as it is too strong.</li>
            <li> Very strong odor that takes some getting used to but worth it.</li>
            <li> I liked the cream very much, A friend told me about the cream and</li>
            <li> I&#x27; been using the rose cream since it first came out because</li>
            <li> RECOMMEND TO EVERYONE!&lt;br /&gt;ABSOLUTELY  SUPER CREAM!  </li>
            <li> Thank you for the quick delivery!</li>
            <li> My husband uses the rose scented and I purchased the large non-scented because I like to use</li>
            <li> The Dmso hslped our back pain problem greatly.</li>
            <li> Take a look at DMSO, as this is a fantastic product.</li>
            <li> and my skin stays smooth.  </li>
            <li> use lightly .</li>
            <li> Worked great to provide instant pain relief on my knee.</li>
            <li> I want to explore more of it&#x27;s healing properties, esp since I have found good back pain relief with MSM (sulfer), which is made from DMSO.</li>
            <li> This stuff works really good on many different ailments.</li>
            <li> One good source is the company started by the medical Doctor that helped so many patients with DMSO therapy - Dr. Stanley Jacob.</li>
            <li> So anyway, thanks for such a great product!</li>
            <li> But as one person said &amp;#34;horses won&#x27;t run if they hurt&amp;#34; so I originally got the stuff from the feed store and it works just fine.  </li>
            <li> Guess I have to be more consistent.</li>
            <li> The rose scent covers the normal stench of the DMSO.</li>
            <li> I use it mixed with Arnica cream, so effective!</li>
            <li> I just went through my first jar and ordered two more.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife and it significantly relieved her pain from arthritis</li>
            <li> good news is that real Medical Grade (or Laboratory Grade) DMSO is readily available.</li>
            <li> I find that the rose scented cream eliminates this situation for me, and the rose scent is very light and delicate.</li>
            <li> I have used it for years to help heal various injuries, always with good results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also no bad taste.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Just make certain that your skin is very clean when you apply the DMSO, as it will carry along with it anything else that is on your skin.  </li>
            <li> Other than that concern, great product.</li>
            <li> Dissipates quickly though.</li>
            <li> and we are healed quickly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been putting it in my neck, as I have mild arthritis and steno-sis and often have neck pain or awaken with headaches.</li>
            <li> WORKS TREMENDOUSLY WELL.</li>
            <li> I am so glad this is back on the market and available to all of us!  </li>
            <li> This product did, the very first night I used it.  </li>
            <li> Dmso is a great pain reliever and will remove a bruise in half the time that nature can.</li>
            <li> This was delivered on time, was exactly what I was expecting, and is working as desired!</li>
            <li> This particular brand has a nice fragrance as DMSO normally has a garlicky smell.</li>
            <li> It is not 100% effective and it is not instant but it works probably 85% to 90% at relieving discomfort.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s definitely worth a try.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Penetrex only and have not yet tried the DMSO Rose Sentented cream.  </li>
            <li> but, if one can afford it, well worth it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m being honest yet keeping an open mind.</li>
            <li> I have used DMSO for nearly 3 years, and have been incredibly pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m not a big fan of rose scent, but</li>
            <li> We purchased this to treat my husband&#x27;s hand for a rare infection (as yet not diagnosed conclusively - whether bacterial or fungal.  </li>
            <li> For 20 dollars it is a chance worth the risk.</li>
            <li> That means the rose fragrance is being absorbed deep into your skin.</li>
            <li> and it goes right away.</li>
            <li> Instead of taking a pill which travels throughout the body, this stuff goes right to the source.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is my second time ordering this product it works very well for joints and aches very pleased</li>
            <li> The fda frowns on treatments that are cheap and effective and readily available (takes money away from big pharamceutical companies)  and if the distributor  labeled it for human issues</li>
            <li> The rose scented DMSO smells strongly of roses, but no garlic or stinky smell like the plain gel.</li>
            <li> this cream really works, I recommend this product to anyone!</li>
            <li> I am aware of it&#x27;s ability to transport whatever is on your skin into your bloodstream.</li>
            <li> Sure in off the next day was gone</li>
            <li> Stick to hot compress or heating pad.</li>
            <li> I first learned about DMSO when I worked at Portland Meadows in 1962.</li>
            <li> I use it daily as I drive for many hours and me legs hurt from clutch pressing and gas pedal pressing and</li>
            <li> I have not used it enough to say more.</li>
            <li> I am aware of the placebo effect</li>
            <li> heal much much much faster!</li>
            <li> We will know more as time passes about the final results of it&#x27;s use.</li>
            <li> They know exactly what they are doing, especially with the cute tree logo and the fact that they market to health food</li>
            <li> I have not found that DMSO offered any more relief than MSM creams that are made for human use.  </li>
            <li> Regardless, while it has a nice fragrance, it had absolutely no discernable effect when applying to my wife&#x27;s arthiritic shoulder.  </li>
            <li> I will be buying more when I get low.  </li>
            <li> His legs look pretty good now and it took a few weeks to heal the sores.</li>
            <li> This stuff also helped his legs not hurt and he slept all night through the first night</li>
            <li> So far don&#x27;t see significant impact</li>
            <li> makes the pain pretty much</li>
            <li> Used it for several years and it helps more than most other pain relief creams and lotions.</li>
            <li> This is better than any icy hot or arthritis creams etc.  </li>
            <li> , it is so pure that there is no noticeable odor.  </li>
            <li> so i am ordering pure liquid dmso.</li>
            <li> For example, if you want to push more B12 into your bloodstream, it can be crushed &amp; dissolved into DMSO</li>
            <li> It works fast.  </li>
            <li> To much cream maybe?</li>
            <li> Thank you so much.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works-it&#x27;s the bomb---------I&#x27;d</li>
            <li> let everyone know it&#x27;s the real deal&lt;</li>
            <li> Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> While it is not a miracle cream, it does take the edge off the intense pain.</li>
            <li> I really wanted it to work.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The product works very well for both of us.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to go to the chiropractor as much when I use this product.</li>
            <li> The easing affect which follows is where the real benefit arrives.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> It works very well.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t work very well</li>
            <li> Since this cream takes whatever non-oil on your skin directly into your blood stream, the iodine is immediately absorbed.  </li>
            <li> and I really was please with it.</li>
            <li> Still researching whether you can put too much DMSO in your system through creams or IV.</li>
            <li> horses\\&quot; (wink..they didnt really have horses).  </li>
            <li> she also confirmed that this is labeled the way it is becuase of the FDA and not because its a different grade.</li>
            <li> It really works on pain.</li>
            <li> I have suffered with sore fingers and knee joint pain for several years, I even make my own lotion that does help, but I wake in the middle of the night sometimes to re apply the lotion.  </li>
            <li> The local health food store was out of this Rose Scented product, so I bought the gel by the same company.  </li>
            <li> A quick word about the rose scented cream is that DMSO can result in a slight garlic-like smell after several days of use.  </li>
            <li> Read other reviews for more specifics.</li>
            <li> the price was better than other websites.</li>
            <li> I use this daily and significantly improved my well being.</li>
            <li> ONLY USE ON CLEAN SURFACE.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised the first night I used it on my hands</li>
            <li> I have been sleeping better, my days are much less painful, and this wonderful product has really brightened my quality of life.  </li>
            <li> This cream is of high quality but being a man  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Can easily move my hands for driving, typing and other tasks--for the price, it cannot be beaten.</li>
            <li> I love it because it works and last a long time.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Bottom line, it helps my shoulder pain when Rx NSAID  pills would not, and the rose has no foul smell nor has it given me any negative reactions.  </li>
            <li> (I&#x27;ve scoured the net, watched videos, and I&#x27;m reading Dr. Morton Walker&#x27;s book on it right now)</li>
            <li> I do not choose to live without it.</li>
            <li> there is a new prescription called Pennsaid.  </li>
            <li> now with 11 dessicated Discs, one new one installed and severe  arthritis in both hands and spine  </li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m giving it a few more days for complete confirmation</li>
            <li> the cream goes on so smooth, no strong odor, very helpful for relieving the pain from my knees, hands and feet.  </li>
            <li> I tried DMSO for the first time and within a few days the muscle pain quickly went away.</li>
            <li> I usually use it in combination with another pain cream, layering the DMSO on top.  </li>
            <li> I am not sure how safe/ healthy that is.</li>
            <li> And it doesn&#x27;t not feel like your body real hot like some of the other cream you put on.  </li>
            <li> We are glad they have some scent to it, because plain DMSO smells pretty bad and we don&#x27;t love the rose scent, but it is a large improvement over plain.  </li>
            <li> Smells so much better than a plain one!</li>
            <li> Medical or pharmaceutical grade is truly 99% pure.</li>
            <li> (besides using pure hydrogen peroxide [35% food grade mixed with reverse osmosis process filtered water to equal pure 2% hydrogen peroxide)</li>
            <li> probably 30 minutes or so later I&#x27;ll realize I&#x27;m not in as much pain.</li>
            <li> I have used DMSO cream for years and often recommended it to others for soft tissue pain issues.</li>
            <li> It smells like old lady purfume.</li>
            <li> For years I have used the old time DMSO suffering with the smell and taste,  </li>
            <li> at 16 years old one application</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s all natural.</li>
            <li> So I am working with an old injury.  </li>
            <li> but she has my 20 year old daughter using it to after her work outs at the gym.  </li>
            <li> I have chronic Lyme, and the pain can be overwhelming, to say the least.  </li>
            <li> I am noticing some real improvement in neck pain and reduced headaches after about 3 days of putting it on daily.</li>
            <li> I like how it soaks in, but so far no relief.</li>
            <li> I am surprised at the people who do not know about DMSO.  </li>
            <li> I did some of the early research on it when it fwrst came out in the 1960s for use in Vet Medicine</li>
            <li> I think it has helped, although, the last time I used DMSO it really had a burning sensation.  </li>
            <li> He&#x27;s been sleeping a lot better lately.</li>
            <li> I have combined it with a larger proportion of the same firm&#x27;s Aloe Vera gel version of this product and thus reduced the rose scent to a bearable level.</li>
            <li> , I am still sick many days after, I do not think this is a reputable company</li>
            <li> Only takes a tiny amount &amp; really reduces pain &amp; stiffness in my knee &amp; finger joint for 4-6 hours.</li>
            <li> wife called them to ask what grade this is, since it isn&#x27;t marked on the container, and they said that the bottle is marked as not for human use, and that it is Industrial grade that they buy in 55 gallon containers.</li>
            <li> works great for me and does not smell bad.</li>
            <li> so if I ever get really bad muscle pains I&#x27;ll try it lol</li>
            <li> Works very well on long term back pain.  </li>
            <li> be careful not to drink too much  one ounce  </li>
            <li> Within a few weeks, I was back at full strength</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use it in large amounts at all, but if I get a cold sore coming on a dab the size of a q tip top 2 or 3 x</li>
            <li> Just place a little bit on the nape of your neck for 3 days at the first sign of a tingle.</li>
            <li> Also there is a new  company that promotes this product which has the active ingredient MSM and aloe  </li>
            <li> it is not generally approved for human use</li>
            <li> I am not sure how much DMSO is in this cream.  </li>
            <li> I had similar injuries after which thigh,calf, leg pain persisted and kept me from playing and running for a long while.</li>
            <li> and I too think this one is dangerous, please only buy pharmeutical grade dmso from a reputable company.</li>
            <li> I take my 70% gel and some of the pure  and make a paste with aspirin or my pain medicine and mix a thick paste  </li>
            <li> Basic instructions for DMSO demands a clean skin surface so as not to push the wrong chemicals into your body.</li>
            <li> Bees like it, too, so be careful when outside!</li>
            <li> I would guess actual DMSO content is minimal.</li>
            <li> I have arthritis and aches and pains associated with muscle pulls or just plain old aging.  </li>
            <li> I have gotten relief using this cream when other topical ointments have not worked for me.  </li>
            <li> Does not turn my collars blue as other products have done.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Since there are other products out there that are manufactured for human use, I can&#x27;t see why anyone would choose to use an industrial solvent.</li>
            <li> I have been using it along with providone iodine, mixing them both together in the palms of my hands, just a dab of the DMSO with a teaspoon of providone iodine and then applying this to my husbands legs once a day, before bedtime, where he has had two open sores for a year and a half because of his diabetes and nothing seemed to heal them, but using this with the iodine has healed them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a little hesitant about using this since DMSO is supposed to make things absorb deep into your skin.</li>
            <li> Will keep trying to use it and see if it helps me further down the road!</li>
            <li> Both the cream and the  Dr Jacobs lab  have minimal taste if any,  </li>
            <li> and that is not much  this cream or the Jacobs mix</li>
            <li> I know a few of your reviewers where scared to use this because it has not been certified for human use.  </li>
            <li> but it was rather rough on my skin.  </li>
            <li> Product is what I expected.  </li>
            <li> I expected a heating affect; it does not heat the affected area.</li>
            <li> You must be careful to sanitize the skin before applying so that harmful pathogens do not go into the body with it.</li>
            <li> Again, maybe I misunderstood the benefits to be expected, but I see no advantage over any drugstore skin creams.  </li>
            <li> As soon as got it, I gave my wife a rubbe downon her stiff back that she was complaining for days.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> No More topical and then apply this over it!</li>
            <li> I kept one and gave the other 2 to my Mother and Aunt for them to try.</li>
            <li> Acetone and other ingredients are &amp;#34;allowed&amp;#34; to exist in that grade.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve used other creams that said it would do things</li>
            <li> Not sure about the actual effect of this stuff</li>
            <li> I also put other supplements on for the DMSO to deliver into the area to help with healing.  </li>
            <li> When first applied you may experience an uncomfortable stinging sensation.</li>
            <li> I mistakenly saw the other reviews saying this after I already bought, so</li>
            <li> I hope this helps reach other people to warn them that even the manufacturer said not to use it on your skin</li>
            <li> It works for Genital Herpies as well just place a small amount just above your tail bone for 3 days and watch the miracle.</li>
            <li> It can carry with it other substances that can be beneficial.</li>
            <li> I told my friend who is treating a family member with cancer (end stage), and she uses it to absord the pain medicine and some other medications through the skin under the care and watch of the doctor.  </li>
            <li> If you struggle with arthritis in your hands or any other joints, this is for you.</li>
            <li> I swear by this stuff for tendonitis and other things.</li>
            <li> Goes on smoothly and does not smell bad like some other DMSO products do.</li>
            <li> Do this for 3 days and say good by to that nasty looking virus.</li>
            <li> Hands down</li>
            <li> My friend put on me and the pain was down in about 5 to 10 minutes.</li>
            <li> I am a  senior citizen and previously had fallen on this knee 3 times.  </li>
            <li> I have to say that I have been taking less pain medications.</li>
            <li> There are a number of books on the subject.</li>
            <li> When my arthritis is really bad, I use it and it works right away!  </li>
            <li> Keep the lid on tight between uses as DMSO attracts oxygen and it will get watery if you don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I was a little unsure about using DMSO.  </li>
            <li> I include in the list of preparations that I have tried with little to no result the prescription ointments also.  </li>
            <li> and it does have a little sulfa  in it.</li>
            <li> , i was hoping it would work but hasnt helped ankle tendenitis not even a little</li>
            <li> Applied some of this and it healed in a few days</li>
            <li> I use this materials and the pain went away after a few hours.</li>
            <li> Something I dont like,  however,  it does relieve pain for a few hours.</li>
            <li> Fever blister will go away within a few days.</li>
            <li> She also has hooked a few of her friends and they all swear by it</li>
            <li> I have to apply it a few times a day to my knees,wrists,and lower back.&lt;br</li>
            <li> One of the few products that works as it says it does.</li>
            <li> and it stopped them from spreading and dried them up in a few days.</li>
            <li> plain DMSO has a \\&quot;stink\\&quot; to it</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve also been using the less expensive 90% gel which takes awhile to dry and does have a garlicky odor.</li>
            <li> I really couldn&#x27;t tell that it did anything for my painful knees.  </li>
            <li> Not sure it works for what I was hoping.</li>
            <li> Works well on arthritic joints, aches and sore muscles without the analgesic usual smell.  </li>
            <li> The 70 % ratio is what is usually recommended.  </li>
            <li> Now, I rub in a small amount of DMSO cream, and the pain literally disappears in seconds - joints, muscles, carpal tunnel, on my face for TMJ pain, below and around ears and over sinus cavities for sinus headaches and earaches, overexertion -</li>
            <li> product does not have a bad smell like some other similar products.</li>
            <li> Everyone, and I mean everyone should have this as a staple in the medicine cabinet.  </li>
            <li> I ordered several products to try on a bad knee.  </li>
            <li> Hmmmm  living in sever pain is not a good thing.</li>
            <li> I am not saying it is not a good product.</li>
            <li> but I dont feel like its working enough for my arthritis :(</li>
            <li> the list is as long as the number of painful areas you have.  </li>
            <li> Unlike the liquid, it doesn&#x27;t smell bad or dry out your skin.  </li>
            <li> Or I should say my wife has not experienced my breath smelling like garlic.  </li>
            <li> This company is truly criminal - they are buying INDUSTRIAL GRADE DMSO in bulk and then marketing it for personal-care use.</li>
            <li> Did nothing for me, false hope.</li>
            <li> My joints are still stiff, but the stabbing pain is gone.</li>
            <li> It does help with muscle aches, but it&#x27;s hard for me to get past the cream base unknowns.</li>
            <li> got a nasty second degree burn from some steam about 3 inches around.</li>
            <li> thank you to the person who wrote about this product being industrial grade, I too think it is, I used the smallest amount of this product and was violently ill needing hospitalisation</li>
            <li> It can be dangerous of your skin is dirty.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve use it on soar muscles, knee pain and to prevent cold soars.</li>
            <li> Let me tell you folks if you ever get cold sores - this stuff will cure it forever.</li>
            <li> Industrial grade DMSO has dangerous contaminants in it like Acetone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was desperate to find something that would help with OA of the hip.  </li>
            <li> My husband suffers with joint pain in his hands and hip and swears by DMSO.</li>
            <li> The scented cream helps to disguise the originally unpleasant scent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had any bad effects from using DMSO.</li>
            <li> it dosen&#x27;t give you bad breath</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t do a thing for me : (</li>
            <li> There is no ingredient listing for the cream base that this DMSO has been incorporated into.</li>
            <li> It was water base.</li>
            <li> and it was terrible garlic taste and at 99.9% burned my skin and would not penetrate the skin, just rolled off my hands and what did go in  had a terrible taste.  </li>
            <li> but i have heard of people with these allergies, but I was 6&#x27;6\\&quot; and had horrible growing pains in my knees  </li>
            <li> But then it made your breath smell terrible and felt like it burned when you put it on.  </li>

            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen any improvements. Guess I have to be more consistent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used quite a bit of this cream over the last ten years. It&#x27;s very light and does smell like roses. Keep the lid on tight between uses as DMSO attracts oxygen and it will get watery if you don&#x27;t. Wash hands before using as DMSO is a carrier that will cause anything with it to be soaked deeply into skin. Wash hands afterwards so you don&#x27;t get it in your eyes or anywhere else you don&#x27;t want it. I&#x27;ve never had any bad effects from using DMSO. Any controversy about this product is unwarranted.</li>
            <li> this cream really works, I recommend this product to anyone!</li>
            <li> I use this for all kinds of aches and pains.  The rose scent covers the normal stench of the DMSO.</li>
            <li> I use this product daily for back and neck pain.  I definitely recommend it</li>
            <li> I want to explore more of it&#x27;s healing properties, esp since I have found good back pain relief with MSM (sulfer), which is made from DMSO. However, now that I have read a ton (I&#x27;ve scoured the net, watched videos, and I&#x27;m reading Dr. Morton Walker&#x27;s book on it right now) I am aware of it&#x27;s ability to transport whatever is on your skin into your bloodstream. For example, if you want to push more B12 into your bloodstream, it can be crushed &amp; dissolved into DMSO them applied to your skin. Basic instructions for DMSO demands a clean skin surface so as not to push the wrong chemicals into your body. There is no ingredient listing for the cream base that this DMSO has been incorporated into. Plus it has rose &amp;#34;scent&amp;#34;, which is yet another chemical. All of that worries me as to what I&#x27;m putting into me with this product. I have ordered Dr. Jacob Stanley&#x27;s pharma grade DMSO and will experiment with that as an alternative. It does help with muscle aches, but it&#x27;s hard for me to get past the cream base unknowns.</li>
            <li> I have suffered with sore fingers and knee joint pain for several years, I even make my own lotion that does help, but I wake in the middle of the night sometimes to re apply the lotion.  I was pleasantly surprised the first night I used it on my hands and then my knee joints, I slept strait through the night.  Thank you!  I will be buying more of this....do you sell stock? (lol) I have been telling others about the way this works, and no garlic taste or smell.</li>
            <li> The Dmso hslped our back pain problem greatly.</li>
            <li> LOVE!!!! I use it every day on my breasts.. I mix in either organic frankincense oil or dragons blood in to this cream</li>
            <li> It helps alleviate arthritic pain.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing for eliminating muscle and joint pains.. I use it mixed with Arnica cream, so effective!</li>
            <li> Works great to get rid of pain.</li>
            <li> Quck delivery.  Thank you!  As for benefit of product, it does help my arthritis some.  I&#x27;m still evaluating though.</li>
            <li> I love this product. Granted it&#x27;s for horses but in my case it works for humans too. It is not 100% effective and it is not instant but it works probably 85% to 90% at relieving discomfort. I apply it and go about my business and probably 30 minutes or so later I&#x27;ll realize I&#x27;m not in as much pain. I use it on my back/hips/knees and calves. I just went through my first jar and ordered two more. This product will not be for everyone but it&#x27;s definitely worth a try.</li>
            <li> I have used DMSO cream for years and often recommended it to others for soft tissue pain issues. The sooner applied after injury the better it seems to work. Having worked as an RN for over 35 years, it never ceased to amaze with it&#x27;s pain relieving abilities.</li>
            <li> Love this cream...so many benefits from DMSO. Product was packaged beautifully and arrived on time.</li>
            <li> This is my second order of this product; so, obviously I like it.</li>
            <li> A tiny bit of this cream vanishes stress redness from skin... Most people simply endure skin problems thinking there can be no relief, this works wonderfully.</li>
            <li> This cream is such a saver!  When my arthritis is really bad, I use it and it works right away!  Love the scent too.</li>
            <li> I was a little unsure about using DMSO.  My naturopath suggested it as a method of pushing topical meds into the skin.  It can be dangerous of your skin is dirty.  ONLY USE ON CLEAN SURFACE.&lt;br /&gt;It is amazing how well it pushes in my topical meds.  A little goes a long way.  Great product.</li>
            <li> My wife purchased the DMSO as well as the Penetrex for me.  I have been using the Penetrex only and have not yet tried the DMSO Rose Sentented cream.  I have no rating for the DEMO. Frank</li>
            <li> I love this stuff and it&#x27;s great for dealing with pain or scar tissue reduction. I do have some concerns however about things I&#x27;ve read as to &amp;#34;industrial&amp;#34; grade or what? It&#x27;s the only DMSO cream I can find so I use it.</li>
            <li> As soon as got it, I gave my wife a rubbe downon her stiff back that she was complaining for days. Sure in off the next day was gone almost100%... I personnally used it to and my son ,so far so good very satisfied..</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use it in large amounts at all, but if I get a cold sore coming on a dab the size of a q tip top 2 or 3 x and it goes right away.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t do a thing for me : (</li>
            <li> This thing works on back pain.  It works fast.  I&#x27;d say within 20 minutes.  Supposedly it makes ones breath smell like garlic.  I haven&#x27;t experienced that.  Or I should say my wife has not experienced my breath smelling like garlic.  Instead of taking a pill which travels throughout the body, this stuff goes right to the source.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also tried the gel which gave me a rash every time.  So I suggest sticking with the cream.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m so happy that the cream goes on and is absorbed so much faster than the gel. this cream has a very pleasant scent, too.  of course, the price is quite a bit more but, if one can afford it, well worth it.  i&#x27;ve also been using the less expensive 90% gel which takes awhile to dry and does have a garlicky odor.</li>
            <li> I strongly recommend DMSO.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had a moderate-to-serious muscle injury while playing soccer. I had similar injuries after which thigh,calf, leg pain persisted and kept me from playing and running for a long while. I tried DMSO for the first time and within a few days the muscle pain quickly went away. It also made the recovery quicker. Within a few weeks, I was back at full strength and I was able to start playing again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product does not have a bad smell like some other similar products.</li>
            <li> Not sure it works for what I was hoping.</li>
            <li> Never live without it!&lt;br /&gt;Perfect for every boo-boo out there and superb on burns!!!&lt;br /&gt;I got a nasty second degree burn from some steam about 3 inches around. Applied some of this and it healed in a few days and I don&#x27;t have a scar.&lt;br /&gt;So great for muscle aches. I use Sore No More topical and then apply this over it! SOOOO good!!!</li>
            <li> Smells so much better than a plain one! Love it</li>
            <li> Works well on arthritic joints, aches and sore muscles without the analgesic usual smell.  We have used this for years.</li>
            <li> When applied it didn&#x27;t rub into the skin easy. To much cream maybe? Took several days of use before any relief. Only lasted a couple of days then had to reapply.Didn&#x27;t like the smell. It smells like old lady purfume. The DMSO at a animal feed store cost 1/3 the price &amp; only took 2 days for results that lasted almost 3 weeks.It was water base. I will however try the gel DMSO to see if it&#x27;s any better then the rose scented. I&#x27;m being honest yet keeping an open mind.</li>
            <li> I am so delighted with this product.  For years I have used the old time DMSO suffering with the smell and taste,  this is a very pleasant change.  Thank you so much.</li>
            <li> I buy this often.  Read other reviews for more specifics.</li>
            <li> Helps my husband with muscle aches.  He&#x27;s always on the go and&lt;br /&gt;appreciates the relief he gets from this product.</li>
            <li> Cream works great and smells pleasant.</li>
            <li> Can easily move my hands for driving, typing and other tasks--for the price, it cannot be beaten. I will order more.</li>
            <li> I have used this among other brands for my arthritis and have found that Topricin and Penetrex works the best. DMSO Cream did not seem as effective and is as smooth to put on.</li>
            <li> Great way to use DMSO. Goes on smoothly and does not smell bad like some other DMSO products do. The price was great.  I found it the same thing in s health food store for $28.00.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for 8 years I do not choose to live without it. It works great on my aches and pains and it also provides your body with the needed oxygen that our bodies need to fight off free radicals that damage our bodies. Great product.</li>
            <li> I have bought multiple purchases of this cream -- because it works.  I have arthritis and aches and pains associated with muscle pulls or just plain old aging.  I have gotten relief using this cream when other topical ointments have not worked for me.  I include in the list of preparations that I have tried with little to no result the prescription ointments also.  Sometimes, I almost forget how well the cream works…until I find it in my supplies and try it again.  It&#x27;s not a miracle cream and it does not totally alleviate the pain.  But, then, nothing does.  To me, it&#x27;s the best of the topicals.  The smell of the DMSO itself is mostly masked by the fragrance in the cream, but it is still there - thus 4 stars.</li>
            <li> Because I liked the movie so much and have watched it more than once. I am a fan of Ton Cruise as well as Jack Nickleson.</li>
            <li> I buy a lot of dmso,  rose scented is ok ,  but I like the 70% i get  from Dr. Jacobs lab, it is so pure that there is no noticeable odor.  This cream is of high quality but being a man  maybe why i dont  like the light rose smell.  and it does go on nicely and works.  I take my 70% gel and some of the pure  and make a paste with aspirin or my pain medicine and mix a thick paste  then add it to the  gel and mix it thoroughly.  Both the cream and the  Dr Jacobs lab  have minimal taste if any,  I bought some a different  source that was 99.9 and it was terrible garlic taste and at 99.9% burned my skin and would not penetrate the skin, just rolled off my hands and what did go in  had a terrible taste.  this product is  awesome  maybe for a woman.  there is a new prescription called Pennsaid.  Now I paid over 230 dollars for 150mils  and that is not much  this cream or the Jacobs mix i make works just as good and the Pennsaid  at a fraction of the cost plus no Dr. visit.  Oh and Pennasid is around12% DMSO  Hmmmm  living in sever pain is not a good thing. take it from me  I have used Dr Jacobs DMSO since 1973  I will warn you do not buy the veterinarian grade . use the rose cream or Dr. Jacobs lab grade only 70  or 80% add your pain med  or strait out of the bottle. Tylenol is to poison for everyone.  so dont try that stuff. any way I hope you try the products i have tried, and watch for a rash and it does have a little sulfa  in it. I dont know anyone that is allergic to sulpha  drugs should use this. but i have heard of people with these allergies, but I was 6&#x27;6\\&quot; and had horrible growing pains in my knees  and  could not do anything because of the pain.  in 1974  I got some of Dr Jacobs dmso coated my knees saturated  them wrapped them with ace bandages and I never had a knee pain again until I was 39.  at 16 years old one application and it took carer of the pain. now with 11 dessicated Discs, one new one installed and severe  arthritis in both hands and spine  kneesmorphine does of someone dying  just doesn&#x27;t do the trick anymore.  P.S.  I even drink a diluted solution with juice or distilled water.  be careful not to drink too much  one ounce  and you will not pass a breathalyzer. Also there is a new  company that promotes this product which has the active ingredient MSM and aloe  and it sells for a bundle  but they claim it is the fountain of youth, MSM  is a powder form of dmso and mixed with a lot of different nutrients ,like glucosimine(which I dont know how to  spell) all comes with MSM the powder form of DMSO  hmmmm</li>
            <li> Great scent but I dont feel like its working enough for my arthritis :( The liquid DMSO seems to work better for me but the liquid stuff doesnt smell as nice as this one. Will keep trying to use it and see if it helps me further down the road!</li>
            <li> I liked the cream very much, A friend told me about the cream and how good it was. Thought I would it a try so I ordered 3 of them. I kept one and gave the other 2 to my Mother and Aunt for them to try. We all are very pleased with the cream and how it helps with sore joints.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We are telling our friends about it to and what it does for us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank You</li>
            <li> I did not find find that this DMSO cream worked at all for me. I will try try it in a different form not cream.</li>
            <li> I rub this stuff on every time my joints or muscles ache.  works great for me and does not smell bad.</li>
            <li> It works for me!  I use this materials and the pain went away after a few hours. I would purchase this again!!</li>
            <li> I am having good results with this. Only takes a tiny amount &amp; really reduces pain &amp; stiffness in my knee &amp; finger joint for 4-6 hours. Gives relief from bursitis in my shoulder too, but to a lesser extent. I can&#x27;t say it smells great though. The rose improves it, but it really just smells like turpentine plus rose. Dissipates quickly though.</li>
            <li> I like the product but it is industrial grade DMSO. Acetone and other ingredients are &amp;#34;allowed&amp;#34; to exist in that grade. Medical or pharmaceutical grade is truly 99% pure.</li>
            <li> this did not help the pain.  both the wife and I tried  it and no change. did not like the smell eqther</li>
            <li> My mother lived to be 99 and absolutely loved this product, said it helped her with aches and pains.  I used to order it for her about 4 times a year.  I personally haven&#x27;t had the need to use it yet.</li>
            <li> Great stuff for pain relief. Used it for several years and it helps more than most other pain relief creams and lotions.</li>
            <li> This helped my quad strain immediately. Very happy with this product! I would recommend this to anyone with a strain or pull.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing, feels good on ailments</li>
            <li> I have used DMSO for nearly 3 years, and have been incredibly pleased with the results.  Take a look at DMSO, as this is a fantastic product.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works-it&#x27;s the bomb---------I&#x27;d let everyone know it&#x27;s the real deal&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used other creams that said it would do things but they never work---I&#x27;m sold&lt;br /&gt;on this product-----Thanks</li>
            <li> Every one, who is suffering from headaches, muscle cramps, frozen shoulders issues, join pain and many other health issues, buy this cream, which will save your money on pills, doctor&#x27;s office visits and makes you happy! Research about DMSO product and you never regret this purchase. I am so happy to have and use  this pain killer every day!</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure if I should use this or not, but it does work. I have plantar fasciitis with varying degrees of pain and just a dime size amount of cream makes the pain pretty much disappear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you take blood thinners, read up on it. I think it&#x27;s suggested to not use DMSO if you do.</li>
            <li> Works great!  But don&#x27;t expect it to smell like roses, it&#x27;s more like menthol.  It&#x27;s a very smooth silky cream that moisturizes, exfoliates and penetrates the skin.  Skin feels like satin.</li>
            <li> Not sure about the actual effect of this stuff but the cream has a good consistency and was promptly delivered.  The scent is a bit too strong for me, but so it goes.  I have combined it with a larger proportion of the same firm&#x27;s Aloe Vera gel version of this product and thus reduced the rose scent to a bearable level.</li>
            <li> No noticeable  difference after using the cream for over one week. Some relief after two. Wouldn&#x27;t buy again. Stick to hot compress or heating pad.</li>
            <li> I know a few of your reviewers where scared to use this because it has not been certified for human use.  It is for horses.  But as one person said &amp;#34;horses won&#x27;t run if they hurt&amp;#34; so I originally got the stuff from the feed store and it works just fine.  I don&#x27;t smell the so called garlic smell but it was rather rough on my skin.  So when I saw this product I bought it and my skin stays smooth.  I will be reordering again.</li>
            <li> Has been a life saving cream for me for years.  The most effective pain relief for my arthritis pain.  combined with&lt;br /&gt;MSM cream it&#x27;s really magic..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy about the speed of delivery and the fact that it is 4 oz size, most are 2 oz. This is a much better value. I will reorder if needed.</li>
            <li> The product does smell like rose.  Something I dont like,  however,  it does relieve pain for a few hours.</li>
            <li> RECOMMEND TO EVERYONE!&lt;br /&gt;ABSOLUTELY  SUPER CREAM!  Very good price. Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> Works well for fever blisters. Use it 3 times a day on lips and about a 3-5 inch spot on upper back.  Fever blister will go away within a few days.</li>
            <li> This is my second time ordering this product it works very well for joints and aches very pleased</li>
            <li> Takes care of neck pain within minutes.  Perfect answer to chronic pain for me.  Does not turn my collars blue as other products have done.  I will always reorder this item when needed.</li>
            <li> I have arthritis in my knee and have tried every cream out there. A friend told me about this stuff and I&#x27;m glad she did. While it is not a miracle cream, it does take the edge off the intense pain. For sure it works better than anything else I have tried. Very strong odor that takes some getting used to but worth it.</li>
            <li> use lightly . Works well for any soreness</li>
            <li> Did nothing for me, false hope. Should have tried with the Aloe in it.</li>
            <li> the cream goes on so smooth, no strong odor, very helpful for relieving the pain from my knees, hands and feet.  I am exxtremely happy with this product. Go for it.</li>
            <li> i bought this by my place in l.a. , i was hoping it would work but hasnt helped ankle tendenitis not even a little so i am ordering pure liquid dmso. i hope that works cuz my ankles are killing me. will post review on amazon when it arrives.</li>
            <li> I first learned about DMSO when I worked at Portland Meadows in 1962. But then it made your breath smell terrible and felt like it burned when you put it on.  I&#x27; been using the rose cream since it first came out because it dosen&#x27;t give you bad breath and it dosen&#x27;t burn, and it works.</li>
            <li> My Dad used this back in the 1930&#x27;s &amp; 40&#x27;s on his horses and himself and swore by it until he died in in 2006.</li>
            <li> For me it works great at relieving arthritis joint pain. I. Use a dab of DMSO and a dab of mineral ice gel on my joints (knees, shoulders, hands, etc.) and soon feel relief.</li>
            <li> Cream is a life saver on spasmes</li>
            <li> This is the best pain reliever medicine out there and it&#x27;s all natural. Can&#x27;t beat that with a bat. Great</li>
            <li> This was delivered on time, was exactly what I was expecting, and is working as desired! If you need DMSO cream, this smells good, massages in quickly and is a good size for travel!</li>
            <li> dmso is amazing, worked much better than I had hoped for</li>
            <li> Excellent service and product</li>
            <li> received in a timely fashion.  Product is what I expected.  Have used it before, find it quite helpful for inflammation.  This brand goes on well,  doesn&#x27;t stay gooey or sticky.</li>
            <li> I ordered several products to try on a bad knee.  I am a  senior citizen and previously had fallen on this knee 3 times.  So I am working with an old injury.  I have several DMSO products I was trying.  This one goes on easily and has no odor and is easy to apply.  The 70 % ratio is what is usually recommended.  I also put other supplements on for the DMSO to deliver into the area to help with healing.  I can see some improvement , but have only been using it for about a week.  Be sure to study up on DMSO and read the reviews.</li>
            <li> Want to feel good immediately? Use this stuff on your aches and pains. Use it on your spine. Don&#x27;t use industrial strength as it causes rashes as it is too strong. This strength is perfect!</li>
            <li> Great delivery and product.</li>
            <li> Very pleased but the fragrance is stronger than I like.</li>
            <li> We love this oxygenated cream. We have a cut, use the cream and we are healed quickly. My wife uses this as anti aging cream. Great product. Will always keep it in the house.</li>
            <li> I really couldn&#x27;t tell that it did anything for my painful knees.  I really wanted it to work.</li>
            <li> I have back pain and a friend suggested this cream. I have to say that I have been taking less pain medications.</li>
            <li> My husband uses the rose scented and I purchased the large non-scented because I like to use&lt;br /&gt;scented body washes.&lt;br /&gt;The product works very well for both of us.  I had been buying a pricey prescription cream and&lt;br /&gt;this does the job for me at a fraction of the cost.</li>
            <li> It could use more instructions on use.</li>
            <li> My mother has been using this for over 10 years and she swears by it.  She says it&#x27;s the best muscle pain killer out there.  I&#x27;ve never used it but she has my 20 year old daughter using it to after her work outs at the gym.  She also has hooked a few of her friends and they all swear by it so if I ever get really bad muscle pains I&#x27;ll try it lol</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to go to the chiropractor as much when I use this product.</li>
            <li> This prod. Is very good for all types of joint and muscular pain. I use it daily as I drive for many hours and me legs hurt from clutch pressing and gas pedal pressing and the relief I get is excellent.</li>
            <li> This stuff works really good on many different ailments. I&#x27;ve use it on soar muscles, knee pain and to prevent cold soars.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my wife. She has joint pain especially after spending time in her gardens. When first applied you may experience an uncomfortable stinging sensation. After a period of time it should subside. The easing affect which follows is where the real benefit arrives. This is simply a really great product. The scented cream helps to disguise the originally unpleasant scent.</li>
            <li> Life is so much more enjoyable since I discovered Rose Scented DMSO Cream!  I have chronic Lyme, and the pain can be overwhelming, to say the least.  Now, I rub in a small amount of DMSO cream, and the pain literally disappears in seconds - joints, muscles, carpal tunnel, on my face for TMJ pain, below and around ears and over sinus cavities for sinus headaches and earaches, overexertion - the list is as long as the number of painful areas you have.  The good news is that the pain truly decreases dramatically and/or disappears in seconds, and an added bonus is that your hands and fingers feel great from rubbing it in!!  Just make certain that your skin is very clean when you apply the DMSO, as it will carry along with it anything else that is on your skin.  A quick word about the rose scented cream is that DMSO can result in a slight garlic-like smell after several days of use.  I find that the rose scented cream eliminates this situation for me, and the rose scent is very light and delicate. I have been sleeping better, my days are much less painful, and this wonderful product has really brightened my quality of life.  If you are suffering from pain, give it a try, and you will be smiling too!!</li>
            <li> On the container itself it states that this should not be put on skin.  I mistakenly saw the other reviews saying this after I already bought, so I hope this helps reach other people to warn them that even the manufacturer said not to use it on your skin</li>
            <li> This cream help a lot my mother in law with her upper back pain.  Was recommend to her and priceless.  Thanks</li>
            <li> It works very well. I&#x27;ve been using it for years. I have to apply it a few times a day to my knees,wrists,and lower back.&lt;br /&gt;It has a pleasant scent of roses. I love it!</li>
            <li> Works very well on long term back pain.  Continuous use is the key to reducing inflammation and relieving chronic pain..</li>
            <li> It is okay. I have not used it enough to say more. I expected a heating affect; it does not heat the affected area. I am not saying it is not a good product.</li>
            <li> great stuff, use it all the time. there are many uses for this cream. the price was better than other websites.</li>
            <li> The best pain cream on the market.</li>
            <li> The local health food store was out of this Rose Scented product, so I bought the gel by the same company.  My skin is irritated by the gel version, but not this Rose cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not a big fan of rose scent, but plain DMSO has a \\&quot;stink\\&quot; to it and I&#x27;d rather smell like roses!</li>
            <li> This product is excellent. I&#x27;ve been putting it in my neck, as I have mild arthritis and steno-sis and often have neck pain or awaken with headaches. I am noticing some real improvement in neck pain and reduced headaches after about 3 days of putting it on daily. I&#x27;ve taken pain pills, had cortisone shots, and physical rehab, and as of today, I feel this cream tops all those. I am aware of the placebo effect so I&#x27;m giving it a few more days for complete confirmation but I&#x27;ve dealt with this so long I&#x27;m sure the DSMO is helping and the rose smell is very pleasant. The cream does not stain, burn, or irritate the skin in this mixture. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I am always pleased with this product for my arthritis.</li>
            <li> Worked great to provide instant pain relief on my knee. Will purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> Thank you for the quick delivery! Item as described! I use this daily and significantly improved my well being. What would I ever do without this miracle cream?! (besides using pure hydrogen peroxide [35% food grade mixed with reverse osmosis process filtered water to equal pure 2% hydrogen peroxide)</li>
            <li> I like how it soaks in, but so far no relief. I will continue for the full 6 weeks to be fair.</li>
            <li> Wonderful customer service and excellent product.</li>
            <li> GREAT IT RELIEVES THE PAIN IN MY HUSBAND&#x27;S FEET!  WORKS GREAT!</li>
            <li> I think it is somewhat effective in relieving arthritis pain but the relief is only 2 hours in my case</li>
            <li> Love the product so many uses and it works great.  A must have for any medicine cabinet or first aide kit!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife and it significantly relieved her pain from arthritis She also liked the rose scent..</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t work very well</li>
            <li> Excellent to use for after surgery pain (when wound is healed).  Go online to investigate the use of DMSO &#x27;cause it is not generally approved for human use but I have had no problem and it works.</li>
            <li> I love it because it works and last a long time.  No awful smell even if you put it on twice aday my husband even like it and my daughter likes it too work for them too.</li>
            <li> Let me tell you folks if you ever get cold sores - this stuff will cure it forever. Just place a little bit on the nape of your neck for 3 days at the first sign of a tingle. Do this for 3 days and say good by to that nasty looking virus. I used to get this 3 times a year for over 30 years and haven&#x27;t had an outbreak in 5 years. It works for Genital Herpies as well just place a small amount just above your tail bone for 3 days and watch the miracle.</li>
            <li> WORKS TREMENDOUSLY WELL. IT WAS FOR MY GRANII~N~GRACE. SHE HURT HER ANKLE RUNNING AN AERATION MACHINE. SHE CALLS IT MIRACLE CREAM.</li>
            <li> this was the fourth order for this product, very good, it works for me.</li>
            <li> This is better than any icy hot or arthritis creams etc.  I am surprised at the people who do not know about DMSO.  Hands down it works.  All sprains,  injuries, etc. heal much much much faster!</li>
            <li> Dmso is a great pain reliever and will remove a bruise in half the time that nature can. I did some of the early research on it when it fwrst came out in the 1960s for use in Vet Medicine</li>
            <li> Awesome stuff mixed with oregano oil for anti inflammatory bliss.</li>
            <li> We purchased this to treat my husband&#x27;s hand for a rare infection (as yet not diagnosed conclusively - whether bacterial or fungal.  We have suffered with this for 7 months.  This is one of the treatments that seems to help.  We are glad they have some scent to it, because plain DMSO smells pretty bad and we don&#x27;t love the rose scent, but it is a large improvement over plain.  We will know more as time passes about the final results of it&#x27;s use.</li>
            <li> I have had problems with my lower back and joints all my life. My wife has fibromyalgia. We both love the relief we get from DMSO.</li>
            <li> DMSO is the only substance known to penetrate the human skin. It can carry with it other substances that can be beneficial. Therefore it can be helpful in soothing sprains and muscle aches. You must be careful to sanitize the skin before applying so that harmful pathogens do not go into the body with it. There are a number of books on the subject. Read one before using this product.</li>
            <li> I have been looking forward to this review.  Everyone, and I mean everyone should have this as a staple in the medicine cabinet.  I have tension headaches that go into my neck.  I rubbed this cream on my neck, and I am not kidding, within 1 to 2 minutes all of the pain was gone!!!  I bumped by leg on a chair. I rubbed this cream on it, and whamooo, no bruise ( and I bruise easy).  I put a drop of iodine a day on my wrist.  Since this cream takes whatever non-oil on your skin directly into your blood stream, the iodine is immediately absorbed.  I use it to absorb hydrogen peroxide and colloidal silver.  I told my friend who is treating a family member with cancer (end stage), and she uses it to absord the pain medicine and some other medications through the skin under the care and watch of the doctor.  Only under the watch and care of a doctor!!!!</li>
            <li> Very pleasant experience. Item arrived ahead of the schedule. Give them 5 stars</li>
            <li> the product did not relieve any pain or discomfort. the rose scent could not overpower the dmso scent.i will not buy this again.</li>
            <li> DMSO is wonderful stuff, and has many therapeutic uses. I have used it for years to help heal various injuries, always with good results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, only MEDICAL GRADE or LABORATORY GRADE DMSO should ever be used for this purpose. This company is truly criminal - they are buying INDUSTRIAL GRADE DMSO in bulk and then marketing it for personal-care use. Industrial grade DMSO has dangerous contaminants in it like Acetone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife called them to ask what grade this is, since it isn&#x27;t marked on the container, and they said that the bottle is marked as not for human use, and that it is Industrial grade that they buy in 55 gallon containers. They know exactly what they are doing, especially with the cute tree logo and the fact that they market to health food stores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The good news is that real Medical Grade (or Laboratory Grade) DMSO is readily available. One good source is the company started by the medical Doctor that helped so many patients with DMSO therapy - Dr. Stanley Jacob. His website is jacoblab.com. Amazon sells some of his products, search using jacob, lab and dmso.</li>
            <li> This is a great way to apply DMSO. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> DMSO is under appreciated and it is a wonderful product worth doing the research on. I like the gel too!</li>
            <li> This product is amazing.  Smells great. and works!  I only use it on my one knee so it last for months.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product. Removes or reduces pain almost immediately. One of the few products that works as it says it does. I use it regularly. A tiny bit does the trick.</li>
            <li> I loved the product!  Easy transaction and would buy from again!  Once again, I have said what I thought was needed..but the system said I needed 9 more words.  Think I have covered that now!</li>
            <li> As others have noted, this product is not made for human use, though that&#x27;s what almost all of the reviews indicate, it&#x27;s being used for.  I have not found that DMSO offered any more relief than MSM creams that are made for human use.  Thus I can&#x27;t recommend this product.  The rose scent does take care of the odor problem, in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since there are other products out there that are manufactured for human use, I can&#x27;t see why anyone would choose to use an industrial solvent.</li>
            <li> I had dislocated my shoulder blade.  The resulting injury was underneath the bone.  Nothing helped until I used this cream with a heating pad.  What a lifesaver.  Give this product a try.  For 20 dollars it is a chance worth the risk.</li>
            <li> I have no idea what this stuff does.</li>
            <li> I was desperate to find something that would help with OA of the hip.  I&#x27;ve tried so many products but nothing has come close to the effectiveness of this product.  Unlike the liquid, it doesn&#x27;t smell bad or dry out your skin.  I keep a jar at home and at work. So thankful that someone introduced me to DMSO!</li>
            <li> Love it. Because comparing with the gel, I didnt feel pain, or ardor, and workes a lot to relieve the pain.</li>
            <li> thank you to the person who wrote about this product being industrial grade, I too think it is, I used the smallest amount of this product and was violently ill needing hospitalisation, I am still sick many days after, I do not think this is a reputable company and I too think this one is dangerous, please only buy pharmeutical grade dmso from a reputable company.</li>
            <li> If you struggle with arthritis in your hands or any other joints, this is for you. Do make sure you have washed the area before using though. My husband suffers with joint pain in his hands and hip and swears by DMSO. This particular brand has a nice fragrance as DMSO normally has a garlicky smell. I my husband will use it and not complain, then it is a great product.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product after reading that people have been using this and I really was please with it. I would order this again in the future.</li>
            <li> The rose scented cream is great. I swear by this stuff for tendonitis and other things. Why not for human use they say/ Beats me.</li>
            <li> This is the best pain cream that I&#x27;ve found, and, believe me, I&#x27;ve tried a lot of them.  I usually use it in combination with another pain cream, layering the DMSO on top.  The rose scent is very nice. Bees like it, too, so be careful when outside!</li>
            <li> Perhaps I didn&#x27;t carefully read the description when purchasing, thus expected too much?  Regardless, while it has a nice fragrance, it had absolutely no discernable effect when applying to my wife&#x27;s arthiritic shoulder.  Years ago, when handling DMSO, I immediately \\&quot;tasted\\&quot; a garlic like flavor as the compound penetrated the skin.  I never \\&quot;tasted\\&quot; anything when using this product.  Again, maybe I misunderstood the benefits to be expected, but I see no advantage over any drugstore skin creams.  I would guess actual DMSO content is minimal.</li>
            <li> Too smelly and the vapors actually irritate my eyes.  I bought to use for carpal tunnel in my wrist and fingers, do work.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a little hesitant about using this since DMSO is supposed to make things absorb deep into your skin. That means the rose fragrance is being absorbed deep into your skin. I am not sure how safe/ healthy that is.</li>
            <li> I have used DMSO for years now. If I wasn&#x27;t completely satisfied I wouldn&#x27;t continue to order it.</li>
            <li> Great stuff.  Did everything I thought it would.  Will have to make sure I keep this around the house.</li>
            <li> I have used this cream several times since it&#x27;s arrival. It soaks in well and is pleasantly rose scented.  I think it has helped, although, the last time I used DMSO it really had a burning sensation.  I am not sure how much DMSO is in this cream.  It doesn&#x27;t give you that sensation such as Ben-gay, etc.  I will continue it, as I still have neck and shoulder pain.  I am hoping it will alleviate it in time.</li>
            <li> Use it like hand cream nightly</li>
            <li> Uses this after every workout.  Works great to get rid of inflammation! I recommend it to everyone that I meet!</li>
            <li> Good scent to the product -- masks its natural odor effectively.  Works well for what I need it to do.</li>
            <li> So far don&#x27;t see significant impact but it&#x27;s ok to use it. May be its creating good effect but I cann&#x27;t confirm.&lt;br /&gt;Keep using it!</li>
            <li> Great stuff! works well and smells nice!</li>
            <li> Have used a lot of topical creams for joint pain relief. This is as good as anything out there. Still researching whether you can put too much DMSO in your system through creams or IV. Other than that concern, great product.</li>
            <li> The rose scented DMSO smells strongly of roses, but no garlic or stinky smell like the plain gel. Also no bad taste.&lt;br /&gt;I have had shoulder pain and a rotator cuff injury and have had cortisone shots but they only worked for a while. A veterinarian friend of mine said that humans have used dmso for years with great success and she knew human doctors who would send people to her clinc to buy it for \\&quot;their horses\\&quot; (wink..they didnt really have horses).  she told me to use the gel when i got shingles and it stopped them from spreading and dried them up in a few days. she also confirmed that this is labeled the way it is becuase of the FDA and not because its a different grade. The fda frowns on treatments that are cheap and effective and readily available (takes money away from big pharamceutical companies)  and if the distributor  labeled it for human issues the fda would be all over them.&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, it helps my shoulder pain when Rx NSAID  pills would not, and the rose has no foul smell nor has it given me any negative reactions.  Also nice cream consistency.</li>
            <li> My usage of this product is based on the suggestion / recommendation of my podiatrist.  The DMSO has proven to be a great medication for the application which it is utilized.  I am Very Happy and Wonderfully Pleased with &amp;#34;DMSO Cream Rose Scented&amp;#34; !!!!   I do Very Sincerely Thank You for my very long term recite of this DMSO Cream Rose Scented Product !!!!   It is a wonderfully medical device !!!  I have utilized the DMSO Cream Rose Scented item for many years by now.  I do Sincerely Thank You,  Ron Folian</li>
            <li> As advertised, the cream works to reduce joint pain for perhaps 3-4 hours. Very good product.</li>
            <li> Super excellent . It really works on pain. It was on me about 6 to 7 hours before I have to put more on. My friend put on me and the pain was down in about 5 to 10 minutes. And it doesn&#x27;t not feel like your body real hot like some of the other cream you put on.  I will be buying more when I get low.  I love it the way it does the pain.Thanks&lt;br /&gt;Would give it a 10 star if they had it</li>
            <li> This stuff works great.  I have been using it along with providone iodine, mixing them both together in the palms of my hands, just a dab of the DMSO with a teaspoon of providone iodine and then applying this to my husbands legs once a day, before bedtime, where he has had two open sores for a year and a half because of his diabetes and nothing seemed to heal them, but using this with the iodine has healed them. The open sores are gone! This stuff worked for us as a carrier to help the body absorb the iodine. His legs look pretty good now and it took a few weeks to heal the sores. This stuff also helped his legs not hurt and he slept all night through the first night I applied it with the iodine. That was a miracle for him because he had been waking up several times a night from the pain. He&#x27;s been sleeping a lot better lately. I am not a doctor and am not telling people to mix this product with iodine or anything else, but for me and my husband, it worked! I think his body also needed the mineral iodine. According to what I have read, we all need more minerals now days because of depletion of our soils. So anyway, thanks for such a great product!</li>
            <li> I love the product. Thank you and I will order from you again.</li>
            <li> Good pricing,  except that it didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> Best for pain! I am so glad this is back on the market and available to all of us!  Try it, you&#x27;ll like it!</li>
            <li> Works great. Has improved the quality of my skin within a week of use.</li>
            <li> I have been dealing with bursitis since November of &#x27;14, and have found nothing to relieve the pain.  This product did, the very first night I used it.  I would wake up several times during the night with pain in my shoulder (akin to someone sticking an icepick in the joint and rotating it).  My joints are still stiff, but the stabbing pain is gone. On the downside, I&#x27;m personally not crazy for the rose scent, as it tends to make me a bit nauseous.  And I have noticed a garlic taste in my mouth.  I&#x27;ll tolerate the scent and the garlic taste over the pain.</li>
            <li> The cream is a lot better than the gel. The gel did not work but this seems to get rid of some of my pains.</li>
