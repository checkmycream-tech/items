            <li>I tried it and loved it.  </li>
            <li>it was good.  </li>
            <li>I am not quite sure how good this product is.</li>
            <li>This was one of the top 5 creams and that was what sold me on it.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend it IF you could find it at a better price.  </li>
            <li>It works great, could see results almost instantly.</li>
            <li>the product arrived in good condition and complete.</li>
            <li>i m very very unsatisfied with the product..</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this cream for 1 month exactly (twice/day)</li>
            <li>i didn&#x27;t see much change i have tried this product 5 times it isn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
            <li>Not wonderful, not the best thing ever, but</li>
            <li>It really works and the price is very reasonable and affordable.  </li>
            <li>But after getting it, it WAS better than average, but just better than average.  </li>
            <li>I have researched online to find that it works, however, I have not used it long enough to know for sure.</li>
            <li>Very natural looking.</li>
            <li>Worked at first but didn&#x27;t last if you don&#x27;t use it every day.</li>
            <li>I purchased this product a month ago and so far see no difference.</li>
            <li>Don not buy this.. it is  a waste of money and it has a very distinct smell that makes me want to throw up..</li>
            <li>I researched several products for removing age spots and this one ranked high.  </li>
            <li>It is a slow removing process which is absolutely fine with me.  </li>
            <li>As a facial cream it&#x27;s pretty good, but no effect yet on the spots :(</li>
            <li>Seems a little much to use all the time.</li>

            <li> I am not quite sure how good this product is. I have researched online to find that it works, however, I have not used it long enough to know for sure.</li>
            <li> It did not do anything but moisturize, no skin brightening, no spot fading. I would never use any of their products again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cream for 1 month exactly (twice/day) and I see absolutedly no difference in my sun spots. As a facial cream it&#x27;s pretty good, but no effect yet on the spots :( I&#x27;ve had them for 6 months and they still look the same. I&#x27;ll finish the tube and see what happens...</li>
            <li> You could use this stuff til the cows come home and it won&#x27;t make a bit of difference in ligntening pigment areas on your face. If anything, it lightens the areas around the pigment spots, so the spots look darker!!&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t waste your money. I wish I didn&#x27;t!!</li>
            <li> i didn&#x27;t see much change i have tried this product 5 times it isn&#x27;t worth it. it is over priced, i suggest customers try orgins</li>

            <li> Is the best for my skin and the delivery time is amazing!!! I have been buying this product since last year and it is just perfect!!!</li>
            <li> Don not buy this.. it is  a waste of money and it has a very distinct smell that makes me want to throw up.. It does not work at all...</li>
            <li> It works great, could see results almost instantly.</li>
            <li> the product arrived in good condition and complete. The results of their effectiveness have not see them, but I will take weeks to make my skin look even and white.</li>
            <li> not need to wait for a couple of weeks, the results appears in a couple of days, i like it</li>
            <li> Not sure it brightens, but I think it works enough for me to keep using it,</li>
