            <li>The brush is awesome for straightening out my frizzy hair after a shampoo.</li>
            <li>Might be perfect for thinner hair, but they don&#x27;t hold on to my hair and they just collapse when I try to use the brush.  </li>

            <li>Nice brush</li>
            <li>This brush has a nice handle but the brush bristles do not stand up to think hair.  </li>
            <li>I gave three stars because the brush is well made and has a nice handle.</li>

            <li>disclaimer:got this item in exchange of my honest review.</li>
            <li>/&gt;These are my own opinions</li>
            <li>Absolutely one of the best brushes I have used to Date!</li>
            <li>hair has always kind of been a disaster.</li>
            <li>The brush utilizes heat from the drier to style quickly, efficiently and beautifully.</li>
            <li>Great price, works really good, and very durable!</li>
            <li>The price was excellent and the size is great for long hair.</li>
            <li>omg i love love it!</li>
            <li>Glad to have had the opportunity to try this at a discount for an honest opinion.  </li>
            <li>This brush worked great the first time I used it</li>
            <li>Works quickly and holds hair fairly well.</li>
            <li>Handle has a comfortable grip, and the barrel is great for blow drying your hair quickly and evenly.</li>
            <li>Love this hair product on my hair.</li>
            <li>I love this brush</li>
            <li>I love revlon brushes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never bought this brand of brush before, and I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>I thought that it was more like a brush</li>
            <li>I was able to get these for .99 each and purchased three of them- one for home, work &amp; my vehicle.</li>
            <li>I love this brush.</li>
            <li>This is a ok brush.</li>
            <li>I love this brush.</li>
            <li>she love this brush... and it was hell of a lot cheaper here than a retail store.</li>
            <li>I love this brush.</li>
            <li>I love the way it looks after I do it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never bought this brand of brush before, and I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>Brush is ok, but could be so much better if the bristles were longer.  </li>
            <li>Love this brush.</li>
            <li>The top piece broke off of the handle&lt;br</li>
            <li>Ok if your looking for a non-expensive brush.</li>
            <li>I love the handle and it doesn&#x27;t have a slit that can yank hair out of your head.</li>
            <li>Its okay.</li>
            <li>Love it; will buy again when needed.</li>
            <li>Love the brush but expect something of this cost to hold up longer than 2 months.</li>
            <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE this brush</li>
            <li>I love the way my hair looks and feels now, thanks to Revlon for another amazing product!</li>
            <li>Very fast delivery, really good .&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
            <li>It is so easy to work with and very smooth.</li>
            <li>I was very sceptic to buy this type of hair brush but all i have to say it is amazing!</li>
            <li>Works pretty good.</li>
            <li>and it worked great, but today it broke while my 12 year old was holding it.  </li>
            <li>It does a great job as far as making my hair shiny and smooth.</li>
            <li>My hair slides off the brush too easily</li>
            <li>Easy to use and hair doesn&#x27;t tangle</li>
            <li>Because of the thermal, it dries my hair (armpit length) very quickly.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a pretty nice brush though otherwise.</li>
            <li>The brush has a comfortable grip handle which easily fits in my hand.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair, so it should be no problem, but</li>
            <li>It also shipped quick!</li>
            <li>Brush barrel is nicely sized, but the bristles don&#x27;t hold on to my fine hair very well.  </li>
            <li>Love this super large brush, makes doing a blowout super easy in your own home.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t expect its going to be this huge</li>
            <li>Great brush for short hair!</li>
            <li>I received my Revlon Perfect Style Thermal Round Brush on time and as described.  </li>
            <li>but so far the ones that I received have held up fairly well.</li>
            <li>Makes hair styling quick and easy.</li>
            <li>Honestly, I am a air dry hair kind of girl</li>
            <li>Straightens my hair easily without getting stuck in my hair also leaves it nice and soft.</li>
            <li>I was excited about the price of this hair brush  </li>
            <li>Oh Revlon, I just love you so much for creating this brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great for those of us who like to straighten with a flat iron, this will help so much!</li>
            <li>Who doesn&#x27;t love a good round brush?</li>
            <li>Its high quality, large, and amazing.</li>
            <li>This is My new favorite from now till forever.</li>
            <li>I gives enough heat to dry to a perfect style.</li>
            <li>Unbeatable price (special offer) and gives long hair a nice lift after blow-drying</li>
            <li>I was thrilled to get this at such a steal!</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t know it was even worth that.  </li>
            <li>makes big curls for flipping the hair at the bottom i liked it</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a really nice size barrel for various hair lengths and for bangs too.</li>
            <li>It would be worth five stars then.</li>
            <li>It works great when blow drying my hair and it even seems to cut drying time in half !</li>
            <li>Other than that, its a good brush.</li>
            <li>the handle just broke right off.  </li>
            <li>The round portion gets really hot while styling with a hair dryer and is great for adding volume and hold.</li>
            <li>I have no idea why it was so cheap as in the stores and even now it is normally in the $10-$15 range.</li>
            <li>This product is light weight and was not hard on my wrist as I  blew out my hair.</li>
            <li>Love it, my hair is thick, wavy and kind of course and this brush has helped so much!</li>
            <li>I love it and use it daily.</li>
            <li>Brush is exactly as described.  </li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Saw the same brush in cvs for 10times more money</li>
            <li>I stuck it in a drawer and went out and bought a different brush for $3 more</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m definitely a fan :)</li>
            <li>It feels like a gentle scalp massage every time I use it!</li>
            <li>Used it for the first time yesterday.</li>
            <li>/&gt;i might be giving the brush too much credit, but hey, it&#x27;s worth a shot.</li>
            <li>This brush is bigger than I expected but works great.  </li>
            <li>really don&#x27;t know how this brush received as many positive ratings as it has unless I simply received a dud.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve got super thick, super long hair, and this reduces frizz and gives me a nice blow-out smooth look.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love curling my hair with this brush as I blow dry it.</li>
            <li>and i feel like it helped dry my hair more evenly with the holes when blow drying.</li>
            <li>The glue holding it together isn&#x27;t strong enough, or melted with the heat of a blow dryer.</li>
            <li>Large brush that makes blow drying a breeze.  </li>
            <li>This brush was too large to use on medium-length layered hair.  </li>
            <li>Nice quality large round brush.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so hard to find good brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Thanks Revlon.</li>
            <li>These types of brushes just make getting my hair to look the way I want sooo much easier.</li>
            <li>but just the look of it is very discouraging.</li>
            <li>Using this while blow drying has given my hair so much volume.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t want to spend too much on a brush</li>
            <li>It did smooth out my medium short hair</li>
            <li>I really like the circumference of the barrel.</li>
            <li>Plus, it&#x27;s very prone to frizz.</li>
            <li>I decided to purchase this brush and start blowing out my hair, and this brush has just absolutely done wonders.</li>
            <li>but I actually really like this one.</li>
            <li>These brushes are perfect and for the price I couldn&#x27;t go wrong!</li>
            <li>As they say timing is everything, last week the original brush fell off the sink and the handle broke off when it hit the floor.</li>
            <li>But if you use it with dry hair it seems to get tangled into the brush easily.</li>
            <li>I have long but fine hair.</li>
            <li>Also works good when my hair is even wet or dry.</li>
            <li>Easy to maneuver and use even with a hair dryer in the other hand.  </li>
            <li>The bristles are missing in many holes and those that they are coming through</li>
            <li>worth for the price but its very Big size</li>
            <li>Bristles are very soft, not hard.</li>
            <li>Bristles are very soft, not hard.</li>
            <li>I inadvertently trashed my ionic brush and needed a new one.</li>
            <li>Gives hair lift and helps dry hair quickly.  </li>
            <li>I loved this brush when I blow dried my hair wet.</li>
            <li>they don&#x27;t come through very far.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had it for a few months now, and use it about 2 times a week, and it&#x27;s still sturdy and going strong.</li>
            <li>I use this with my blow-dryer and cuts my drying time down significantly, we&#x27;re talking like 3/4s.  </li>
            <li>The brush is large so it would probably not work with very short hair.</li>
            <li>It pulls the hair near the handle and also the rubber material around it doesn&#x27;t let the hair slide.</li>
            <li>This brush just looks professional.</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t get the sleak volumized hair style that I was able to achieve with my old round brush that broke after several years use.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It heats up on contact, it&#x27;s big and round, it&#x27;s pretty much exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>My hair has so much more bounce, and a little less frizz then normal after using this with my blow dryer.</li>
            <li>Applied with a little heat from the blow drier, the brush rolls through and makes a nice round curl at the end of my hair</li>
            <li>My hair is suddenly shiny and stylish instead of dull and blah.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Helps my hair dry really fast.</li>
            <li>I barely used it!</li>
            <li>Only problem is it didn&#x27;t completely grab my hair.</li>
            <li>bristles on this brush are too soft to actually capture your hair.</li>
            <li>However after prolonged use, Some of the black coating evidently peels off of the brush</li>
            <li>This brush is bigger than I expected - the description does say large</li>
            <li>I also don&#x27;t get too much hair stuck in it like my other brushes.</li>
            <li>high quality, of course, Revlon products usually make high quality prodcts!  </li>
            <li>however it&#x27;s completely ineffective when using as I blow my hair dry.  </li>
            <li>The bristles are not long enough to &amp;#34;grab&amp;#34; my hair.  </li>
            <li>(past shoulders).&lt;br /&gt;- VERY fast drying time with hair dryer&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
    </ol>

    <ol>
            <li> Awesome brush.</li>
            <li> The brush is awesome for straightening out my frizzy hair after a shampoo.</li>
            <li> Might be perfect for thinner hair, but they don&#x27;t hold on to my hair and they just collapse when I try to use the brush.  </li>

            <li> Nice brush</li>
            <li> This brush has a nice handle but the brush bristles do not stand up to think hair.  </li>

            <li> /&gt;These are my own opinions</li>
            <li> Absolutely one of the best brushes I have used to Date!</li>
            <li> hair has always kind of been a disaster.</li>
            <li> The brush utilizes heat from the drier to style quickly, efficiently and beautifully.</li>
            <li> Great price, works really good, and very durable!</li>
            <li> The price was excellent and the size is great for long hair.</li>
            <li> omg i love love it!</li>
            <li> Glad to have had the opportunity to try this at a discount for an honest opinion.  </li>
            <li> This brush worked great the first time I used it</li>
            <li> Works quickly and holds hair fairly well.</li>
            <li> Handle has a comfortable grip, and the barrel is great for blow drying your hair quickly and evenly.</li>
            <li> Love this hair product on my hair.</li>
            <li> I love this brush</li>
            <li> I love revlon brushes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never bought this brand of brush before, and I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> I thought that it was more like a brush</li>
            <li> I was able to get these for .99 each and purchased three of them- one for home, work &amp; my vehicle.</li>
            <li> I love this brush.</li>
            <li> This is a ok brush.</li>
            <li> I love this brush.</li>
            <li> she love this brush... and it was hell of a lot cheaper here than a retail store.</li>
            <li> I love this brush.</li>
            <li> I love the way it looks after I do it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never bought this brand of brush before, and I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> Brush is ok, but could be so much better if the bristles were longer.  </li>
            <li> Love this brush.</li>
            <li> The top piece broke off of the handle&lt;br</li>
            <li> Ok if your looking for a non-expensive brush.</li>
            <li> I love the handle and it doesn&#x27;t have a slit that can yank hair out of your head.</li>
            <li> Its okay.</li>
            <li> Love it; will buy again when needed.</li>
            <li> Love the brush but expect something of this cost to hold up longer than 2 months.</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE this brush</li>
            <li> I love the way my hair looks and feels now, thanks to Revlon for another amazing product!</li>
            <li> Very fast delivery, really good .&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
            <li> It is so easy to work with and very smooth.</li>
            <li> I was very sceptic to buy this type of hair brush but all i have to say it is amazing!</li>
            <li> Works pretty good.</li>
            <li> and it worked great, but today it broke while my 12 year old was holding it.  </li>
            <li> It does a great job as far as making my hair shiny and smooth.</li>
            <li> My hair slides off the brush too easily</li>
            <li> Easy to use and hair doesn&#x27;t tangle</li>
            <li> Because of the thermal, it dries my hair (armpit length) very quickly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a pretty nice brush though otherwise.</li>
            <li> The brush has a comfortable grip handle which easily fits in my hand.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair, so it should be no problem, but</li>
            <li> It also shipped quick!</li>
            <li> Brush barrel is nicely sized, but the bristles don&#x27;t hold on to my fine hair very well.  </li>
            <li> Love this super large brush, makes doing a blowout super easy in your own home.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect its going to be this huge</li>
            <li> Great brush for short hair!</li>
            <li> I received my Revlon Perfect Style Thermal Round Brush on time and as described.  </li>
            <li> but so far the ones that I received have held up fairly well.</li>
            <li> Makes hair styling quick and easy.</li>
            <li> Honestly, I am a air dry hair kind of girl</li>
            <li> Straightens my hair easily without getting stuck in my hair also leaves it nice and soft.</li>
            <li> I was excited about the price of this hair brush  </li>
            <li> Oh Revlon, I just love you so much for creating this brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Great for those of us who like to straighten with a flat iron, this will help so much!</li>
            <li> Who doesn&#x27;t love a good round brush?</li>
            <li> Its high quality, large, and amazing.</li>
            <li> This is My new favorite from now till forever.</li>
            <li> I gives enough heat to dry to a perfect style.</li>
            <li> Unbeatable price (special offer) and gives long hair a nice lift after blow-drying</li>
            <li> I was thrilled to get this at such a steal!</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t know it was even worth that.  </li>
            <li> makes big curls for flipping the hair at the bottom i liked it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a really nice size barrel for various hair lengths and for bangs too.</li>
            <li> It would be worth five stars then.</li>
            <li> It works great when blow drying my hair and it even seems to cut drying time in half !</li>
            <li> Other than that, its a good brush.</li>
            <li> the handle just broke right off.  </li>
            <li> The round portion gets really hot while styling with a hair dryer and is great for adding volume and hold.</li>
            <li> I have no idea why it was so cheap as in the stores and even now it is normally in the $10-$15 range.</li>
            <li> This product is light weight and was not hard on my wrist as I  blew out my hair.</li>
            <li> Love it, my hair is thick, wavy and kind of course and this brush has helped so much!</li>
            <li> I love it and use it daily.</li>
            <li> Brush is exactly as described.  </li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> Saw the same brush in cvs for 10times more money</li>
            <li> I stuck it in a drawer and went out and bought a different brush for $3 more</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m definitely a fan :)</li>
            <li> It feels like a gentle scalp massage every time I use it!</li>
            <li> Used it for the first time yesterday.</li>
            <li> /&gt;i might be giving the brush too much credit, but hey, it&#x27;s worth a shot.</li>
            <li> This brush is bigger than I expected but works great.  </li>
            <li> really don&#x27;t know how this brush received as many positive ratings as it has unless I simply received a dud.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got super thick, super long hair, and this reduces frizz and gives me a nice blow-out smooth look.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love curling my hair with this brush as I blow dry it.</li>
            <li> and i feel like it helped dry my hair more evenly with the holes when blow drying.</li>
            <li> The glue holding it together isn&#x27;t strong enough, or melted with the heat of a blow dryer.</li>
            <li> Large brush that makes blow drying a breeze.  </li>
            <li> This brush was too large to use on medium-length layered hair.  </li>
            <li> Nice quality large round brush.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so hard to find good brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Thanks Revlon.</li>
            <li> These types of brushes just make getting my hair to look the way I want sooo much easier.</li>
            <li> but just the look of it is very discouraging.</li>
            <li> Using this while blow drying has given my hair so much volume.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to spend too much on a brush</li>
            <li> It did smooth out my medium short hair</li>
            <li> I really like the circumference of the barrel.</li>
            <li> Plus, it&#x27;s very prone to frizz.</li>
            <li> I decided to purchase this brush and start blowing out my hair, and this brush has just absolutely done wonders.</li>
            <li> but I actually really like this one.</li>
            <li> These brushes are perfect and for the price I couldn&#x27;t go wrong!</li>
            <li> As they say timing is everything, last week the original brush fell off the sink and the handle broke off when it hit the floor.</li>
            <li> But if you use it with dry hair it seems to get tangled into the brush easily.</li>
            <li> I have long but fine hair.</li>
            <li> Also works good when my hair is even wet or dry.</li>
            <li> Easy to maneuver and use even with a hair dryer in the other hand.  </li>
            <li> The bristles are missing in many holes and those that they are coming through</li>
            <li> worth for the price but its very Big size</li>
            <li> Bristles are very soft, not hard.</li>
            <li> Bristles are very soft, not hard.</li>
            <li> I inadvertently trashed my ionic brush and needed a new one.</li>
            <li> Gives hair lift and helps dry hair quickly.  </li>
            <li> I loved this brush when I blow dried my hair wet.</li>
            <li> they don&#x27;t come through very far.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it for a few months now, and use it about 2 times a week, and it&#x27;s still sturdy and going strong.</li>
            <li> I use this with my blow-dryer and cuts my drying time down significantly, we&#x27;re talking like 3/4s.  </li>
            <li> The brush is large so it would probably not work with very short hair.</li>
            <li> It pulls the hair near the handle and also the rubber material around it doesn&#x27;t let the hair slide.</li>
            <li> This brush just looks professional.</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t get the sleak volumized hair style that I was able to achieve with my old round brush that broke after several years use.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It heats up on contact, it&#x27;s big and round, it&#x27;s pretty much exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> My hair has so much more bounce, and a little less frizz then normal after using this with my blow dryer.</li>
            <li> Applied with a little heat from the blow drier, the brush rolls through and makes a nice round curl at the end of my hair</li>
            <li> My hair is suddenly shiny and stylish instead of dull and blah.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Helps my hair dry really fast.</li>
            <li> I barely used it!</li>
            <li> Only problem is it didn&#x27;t completely grab my hair.</li>
            <li> bristles on this brush are too soft to actually capture your hair.</li>
            <li> However after prolonged use, Some of the black coating evidently peels off of the brush</li>
            <li> This brush is bigger than I expected - the description does say large</li>
            <li> I also don&#x27;t get too much hair stuck in it like my other brushes.</li>
            <li> high quality, of course, Revlon products usually make high quality prodcts!  </li>
            <li> however it&#x27;s completely ineffective when using as I blow my hair dry.  </li>
            <li> The bristles are not long enough to &amp;#34;grab&amp;#34; my hair.  </li>
            <li> (past shoulders).&lt;br /&gt;- VERY fast drying time with hair dryer&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m trying not to use my straight iron every day, because I think it was starting to dry my hair out a little.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I got busy with my daughter&#x27;s wedding and didn&#x27;t get around to returning it in time for a full refund.  </li>
            <li> Then I would spend another 20-30 minutes with my flat iron to get out any kinks or wave that</li>
            <li> The only issue all 3 of us have had is sometimes our hair is getting tangled in them once it starts to dry.</li>
            <li> Works well for blow drying my long hair.  </li>
            <li> Would definitely only recommend using when hair is wet</li>
            <li> They were much larger than I expected them to be but that was a plus in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair and sometimes a round brush ends up just getting tangled and damages my hair</li>
            <li> addition , the size is larger than expected.</li>
            <li> My previous brush like this (Large, Thermal, Round, Revlon) got stepped on so it no longer worked as I needed it to.</li>
            <li> that flat iron daily also bristles are strong hasn&#x27;t broken yet!!</li>
            <li> Does not grab the hair in a way that helps blow dry it.</li>
            <li> This brush helps my hairdryer to quickly dry my hair.</li>
            <li> I really wish the bristles were just a wee little bit longer; my hair has a hard time staying on the brush.</li>
            <li> I think this is just me not being careful though.</li>
            <li> It holds my hair though, but does not really style it.</li>
            <li> They worked well for blow drying and styling our hair when wet.</li>
            <li> so i know she wasn&#x27;t being rough with it.  </li>
            <li> It is not straight, not curly, not really even wavy.</li>
            <li> I have thick hair that gets stuck in round brushes, but this particular one works for me.</li>
            <li> I lost my old ceramic brush and was in desperate need of a new one.</li>
            <li> this doesn&#x27;t brake your hair like other brushes.</li>
            <li> This was a fraction of the cost of the other brush but works just as well.</li>
            <li> Does not get stuck in my hair like all the other&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> My other brushes handles are always breaking because my hair is so thick, this brush really holds up against thick curly hair</li>
            <li> I have really thick hair and the bristles are a little wimpy (short and soft), so the goings a little slow</li>
            <li> That is my only complaint about this brush.</li>
            <li> I would definitely hate it even more...</li>
            <li> Hate it....catches and pulls my hair like no other... doesn&#x27;t even dry hair that fast...</li>
            <li> + minutes with my old round brush and blow dryer and eventually give up because my arms were too tired to continue.</li>
            <li> Ever since I started using ceramic instead of metal, my hair feels less frizzy and looks shinier.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty disappointed, but I glued it back together.</li>
            <li> For daily brushing this is not a good brush at all.</li>
            <li> This brush is going to work swell when I gift it to my g-dtr who has thick curly long hair</li>
            <li> Very hard to find a round brush with a larger barrel that doesn&#x27;t pull your hair.</li>
            <li> Or ir you just want to get your hair blow dried</li>
            <li> I have seen a few people get some duds that fell apart</li>
            <li> Just a heads up that this is not your standard-size round brush.</li>
            <li> The round helps give NY hair the volume I need.</li>
            <li> The bristles wouldn&#x27;t grab my hair at all, so I couldn&#x27;t wrap it around the round brush while drying.  </li>
            <li> The handle broke off after a few months</li>
            <li> I have relatively thin hair and this brush does not damage my hair or tangle it when winding hair to dry.</li>
            <li> It kinda hurt my scalp cut the brush is kinda hard.  </li>
            <li> My hair is thick and voluminous.</li>
            <li> Not a good brush.  </li>
            <li> however it&#x27;s no good for my medium textured shoulder length</li>
            <li> Not good at all,</li>
            <li> I was a little disappointed that my daughter dropped the brush on the floor and the handle broke.</li>
            <li> I have curly hair and must brushes are extremely painful when combing through it</li>
            <li> Disappointed.</li>
            <li> I used this stupid brush 3 times before it fell apart.  </li>
            <li> The barrel is glued to the base, and the glue doesn&#x27;t hold up under heat.  </li>
            <li> I went to use this hairbrush and it is awful!  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I got this brush for my girls and myself. I am amazed at how great it is. Its high quality, large, and amazing. I would recommend this brush to anyone. It helps us daily style and head out the door. It also shipped quick!</li>
            <li> Woot woot! Helps with my frizzy hair too!</li>
            <li> I love this brush!  It works well with my blow dryer to straighten my hair and get rid of frizz.</li>
            <li> Awesome brush. I love it and use it daily.</li>
            <li> I have wavy to curly just longer than shoulder length hair and blow drying it is the biggest pain on the planet. I used to spend 45+ minutes with my old round brush and blow dryer and eventually give up because my arms were too tired to continue. Then I would spend another 20-30 minutes with my flat iron to get out any kinks or wave that I missed.&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Size is great for my hair length (past shoulders).&lt;br /&gt;- VERY fast drying time with hair dryer&lt;br /&gt;- Does not pull hair!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- Some hairs get snagged on the handle. I think this is just me not being careful though. Still 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;Summary:&lt;br /&gt;This brush has changed my life.</li>
            <li> Love this super large brush, makes doing a blowout super easy in your own home. Or ir you just want to get your hair blow dried faster this is the brush for you.</li>
            <li> Very nice hair brush. My hair has so much more bounce, and a little less frizz then normal after using this with my blow dryer. I definitely recommend this.</li>
            <li> Nice brush it helps to style my curly hair</li>
            <li> I wish the brush tips were just a bit longer, but all in all, I love this brush!!</li>
            <li> This brush is going to work swell when I gift it to my g-dtr who has thick curly long hair</li>
            <li> I was thrilled to get this at such a steal! The brush is awesome for straightening out my frizzy hair after a shampoo.</li>
            <li> Love this hair product on my hair. It works wonders. Thanks Revlon.</li>
            <li> This brush has a nice handle but the brush bristles do not stand up to think hair.  Might be perfect for thinner hair, but they don&#x27;t hold on to my hair and they just collapse when I try to use the brush.  I gave three stars because the brush is well made and has a nice handle.</li>
            <li> Great brush and easy to use</li>
            <li> Great brush for short hair! I love this brush this doesn&#x27;t brake your hair like other brushes. I love revlon brushes.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Brush is exactly as described.  Gives hair lift and helps dry hair quickly.  The brush is large so it would probably not work with very short hair.</li>
            <li> Brush barrel is nicely sized, but the bristles don&#x27;t hold on to my fine hair very well.  Handle has a comfortable grip, and the barrel is great for blow drying your hair quickly and evenly.</li>
            <li> Very good brush.  Lightweight, east to hold.</li>
            <li> Not a good brush.  Used once and tossed.</li>
            <li> Hate it....catches and pulls my hair like no other... doesn&#x27;t even dry hair that fast... If it wasn&#x27;t 99cents I would definitely hate it even more... you get what you pay for I guess....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never bought this brand of brush before, and I absolutely love it. Bristles are very soft, not hard. I have curly hair, and doesn&#x27;t get tangled in it at all. Got this for a great deal!</li>
            <li> Makes hair styling quick and easy. This is a well-made brush and is an excellent value for the money</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used these myself . I got tgem as Christmas presents for my 2 nieces. Thanks!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in loooove. I&#x27;ve never had a brush like this before so I have nothing to compare it to but I am very, very happy! :)</li>
            <li> Saw the same brush in cvs for 10times more money</li>
            <li> I got a couple of these brushes while they were selling them for a steal! I lost my old ceramic brush and was in desperate need of a new one. Ever since I started using ceramic instead of metal, my hair feels less frizzy and looks shinier. These types of brushes just make getting my hair to look the way I want sooo much easier. I have seen a few people get some duds that fell apart but so far the ones that I received have held up fairly well.</li>
            <li> Large brush that makes blow drying a breeze.  Works quickly and holds hair fairly well. No complaints</li>
            <li> This is a very good brush. My hair is always getting tangled and this brush works great. I use it everydasy on my hair. Also works good when my hair is even wet or dry.</li>
            <li> This brush is bigger than I expected - the description does say large so I&#x27;ll take the blame for that. Just a heads up that this is not your standard-size round brush. Still works great for blowing out my shoulder length bob.</li>
            <li> What an awesome deal on this brush!  Works well for blow drying my long hair.  And you just can&#x27;t beat the price!  I might buy an extra just to keep on hand.</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for I guess.  This was a add-on item for 99 cents and I don&#x27;t know it was even worth that.  The bristles are missing in many holes and those that they are coming through they don&#x27;t come through very far.  I haven&#x27;t used it yet but just the look of it is very discouraging.</li>
            <li> Disappointed. It pulls the hair near the handle and also the rubber material around it doesn&#x27;t let the hair slide.</li>
            <li> Great price for a great styling blow out brush!</li>
            <li> Good product as described.</li>
            <li> Not MY type of brush... I thought that it was more like a brush but it has stabby bristles that hurt my head!</li>
            <li> nice item, and nice seller.</li>
            <li> Great deal on brushes!! I was able to get these for .99 each and purchased three of them- one for home, work &amp; my vehicle. These brushes are perfect and for the price I couldn&#x27;t go wrong!</li>
            <li> I use this for my &amp;#34;styling&amp;#34;, with an exception that it does not style my hair. My hair is thick and voluminous. So, if you have thin/fine hair, you can try your luck. It holds my hair though, but does not really style it.</li>
            <li> Great brush for blow drying. The brush utilizes heat from the drier to style quickly, efficiently and beautifully.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with this brush. I inadvertently trashed my ionic brush and needed a new one. This was a fraction of the cost of the other brush but works just as well. No frizzy ends. Great results when using it with my bio-ionic blow dryer</li>
            <li> I love this brush. I gives enough heat to dry to a perfect style. The round helps give NY hair the volume I need.</li>
            <li> Great price, works really good, and very durable!</li>
            <li> This product is light weight and was not hard on my wrist as I  blew out my hair. Only problem is it didn&#x27;t completely grab my hair. Other than that, its a good brush.</li>
            <li> I used this stupid brush 3 times before it fell apart.  The barrel is glued to the base, and the glue doesn&#x27;t hold up under heat.  I stuck it in a drawer and went out and bought a different brush for $3 more and it works great.  Unfortunately I got busy with my daughter&#x27;s wedding and didn&#x27;t get around to returning it in time for a full refund.  DON&#x27;T BUY THIS BRUSH.</li>
            <li> Using this while blow drying has given my hair so much volume. I no longer have to go to the salon for a hair &#x27;blowout&#x27; so I&#x27;m saving a ton with this brush.</li>
            <li> Great brush, gives me great volume and smoothes out my hair.</li>
            <li> Great brush for a great price!</li>
            <li> I loved this brush when I blow dried my hair wet. But if you use it with dry hair it seems to get tangled into the brush easily. Would definitely only recommend using when hair is wet</li>
            <li> I use this with my blow-dryer and cuts my drying time down significantly, we&#x27;re talking like 3/4s.  I&#x27;ve got super thick, super long hair, and this reduces frizz and gives me a nice blow-out smooth look.  I&#x27;ve gotten many complements!  Easy to maneuver and use even with a hair dryer in the other hand.  I&#x27;ve had it for a few months now, and use it about 2 times a week, and it&#x27;s still sturdy and going strong.</li>
            <li> makes big curls for flipping the hair at the bottom i liked it alot</li>
            <li> Nice brush!  high quality, of course, Revlon products usually make high quality prodcts!  Does a great job if you need some body and volume will drying your hair. I got this item at a discounted rate in exchange for a review.</li>
            <li> It does a great job as far as making my hair shiny and smooth. My hair definitely dries faster as well. It&#x27;s a really nice size barrel for various hair lengths and for bangs too. I really wish the bristles were just a wee little bit longer; my hair has a hard time staying on the brush. Occasionally a hair or two will get caught on the upper brush part in the seam between the metal and plastic portion. It&#x27;s a pretty nice brush though otherwise.</li>
            <li> Does not grab the hair in a way that helps blow dry it.</li>
            <li> Great product at a great price. Nice quality large round brush.</li>
            <li> Nice brush! Good quality, I&#x27;ve had problems with it. Works the best when combined with blow drying!</li>
            <li> This is a ok brush. It is great for blow drying hair but that is about it. For daily brushing this is not a good brush at all. I was a little disappointed that my daughter dropped the brush on the floor and the handle broke. If I wouldn&#x27;t got for 99 cents I would be returning and getting my money back.</li>
            <li> Who doesn&#x27;t love a good round brush? I bought a couple of these at a discounted price for my mom and myself. I knew if I didn&#x27;t get her one she would just end up taking mine on one of her visits. It works great to get a nice under curl while blow drying your hair. Gives nice volume to my hair and dries it quicker.</li>
            <li> I love this brush. Honestly, I am a air dry hair kind of girl but, this brush has changed that for me. It is so easy to work with and very smooth.</li>
            <li> this brush is perfect for blowdrying and styling your hair. Revlon never cease to amaze me.</li>
            <li> Awesome brush!! Does not get stuck in my hair like all the other&#x27;s. Very happy customer I would suggest this brush to anyone.</li>
            <li> This brush is bigger than I expected but works great.  Helps my hair dry really fast.</li>
            <li> My previous brush like this (Large, Thermal, Round, Revlon) got stepped on so it no longer worked as I needed it to. I didn&#x27;t want to spend too much on a brush so I came to Amazon. For some reason this was being offered as a .99 Add-On item. I have no idea why it was so cheap as in the stores and even now it is normally in the $10-$15 range. I purchased it and of course was happy with it. It is perfect for home blow outs. I have relatively thin hair and this brush does not damage my hair or tangle it when winding hair to dry.</li>
            <li> I used this for the time today.  My stylist recently told me to use a blow dryer brush with the spiky bristles vs. a brush with the plastic tipped bristles.  It did smooth out my medium short hair and I liked the volume.  I&#x27;m trying not to use my straight iron every day, because I think it was starting to dry my hair out a little.</li>
            <li> This brush worked great the first time I used it and then the second time It broke. The glue holding it together isn&#x27;t strong enough, or melted with the heat of a blow dryer. Either way, it didn&#x27;t even last me two blowouts.</li>
            <li> she love this brush... and it was hell of a lot cheaper here than a retail store. well built and sturdy.</li>
            <li> This brush helps my hairdryer to quickly dry my hair. Also helps to retain moisture. The brush has a comfortable grip handle which easily fits in my hand. Good hair brush for sure!</li>
            <li> Wonderful tool for blowing out your hair!</li>
            <li> I love this brush. It works great when blow drying my hair and it even seems to cut drying time in half ! My hair actually has volume and bounce now! I love the way my hair looks and feels now, thanks to Revlon for another amazing product! I received this product at a discounted price for my unbiased review!</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and great quality!</li>
            <li> great for blow drying and straightening kinky hair a must for those of us that flat iron daily also bristles are strong hasn&#x27;t broken yet!!</li>
            <li> I have really thick hair and the bristles are a little wimpy (short and soft), so the goings a little slow but it gets the job done.</li>
            <li> Amazing brush! Great quality!</li>
            <li> I was excited about the price of this hair brush  and it also appeared to be the correct size however it&#x27;s no good for my medium textured shoulder length hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bristles on this brush are too soft to actually capture your hair. It was the perfect width that I was looking for however it&#x27;s completely ineffective when using as I blow my hair dry.  My hair slides off the brush too easily so I can&#x27;t get the sleak volumized hair style that I was able to achieve with my old round brush that broke after several years use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really don&#x27;t know how this brush received as many positive ratings as it has unless I simply received a dud.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love curling my hair with this brush as I blow dry it. I love the way it looks after I do it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never bought this brand of brush before, and I absolutely love it. Bristles are very soft, not hard. I have wavy/curly hair, and doesn&#x27;t get tangled in it at all. Would buy again for sure!</li>
            <li> Brush is ok, but could be so much better if the bristles were longer.  The bristles are not long enough to &amp;#34;grab&amp;#34; my hair.  I have long but fine hair.</li>
            <li> Love this brush. It gives great volumn</li>
            <li> The top piece broke off of the handle&lt;br /&gt;2 months after I bought this! I only used it once or twice a week.</li>
            <li> works great, can&#x27;t beat the price of under a dollar</li>
            <li> I ordered 3 of these brushes. One for myself, one for my daughter and one for my son&#x27;s girlfriend. They were much larger than I expected them to be but that was a plus in my opinion. They worked well for blow drying and styling our hair when wet. The only issue all 3 of us have had is sometimes our hair is getting tangled in them once it starts to dry. It&#x27;s getting wrapped around the barrel and then doesn&#x27;t want to slide off without pulling some. We all have shoulder length or longer hair so maybe wouldn&#x27;t happen with shorter hair. Otherwise, it&#x27;s a very nice brush and lives up the the Revlon name and reputation.</li>
            <li> Ok if your looking for a non-expensive brush. It does hold though.</li>
            <li> Love this!!!  Use it almost every time I style my hair!</li>
            <li> My wife loves it.. All that matters</li>
            <li> This brush just looks professional. I love the handle and it doesn&#x27;t have a slit that can yank hair out of your head. The round portion gets really hot while styling with a hair dryer and is great for adding volume and hold. I love it!</li>
            <li> AWESOME MY DAUGHTER IS 17 AND LOVES IT HEATS NICELY KEEPS GREAT CURL TO HER HAIR.</li>
            <li> sturdy handle and seems well made. i bought it for the gf and she loves it . . . .</li>
            <li> This brush was too large to use on medium-length layered hair.  The bristles wouldn&#x27;t grab my hair at all, so I couldn&#x27;t wrap it around the round brush while drying.  I returned it.</li>
            <li> Works pretty good. The price was excellent and the size is great for long hair.</li>
            <li> Its okay. I barely used it! It is a nice brush.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect its going to be this huge but omg i love love it! It kinda hurt my scalp cut the brush is kinda hard.  But does its job. disclaimer:got this item in exchange of my honest review.</li>
            <li> I have thick hair that gets stuck in round brushes, but this particular one works for me. Applied with a little heat from the blow drier, the brush rolls through and makes a nice round curl at the end of my hair</li>
            <li> It heats up on contact, it&#x27;s big and round, it&#x27;s pretty much exactly what I was looking for. I also don&#x27;t get too much hair stuck in it like my other brushes.</li>
            <li> I received my Revlon Perfect Style Thermal Round Brush on time and as described.  I have shoulder length hair and the bristles glide through my hair without any pulling.  I use it after my shower to comb out my hair and it does a great job. Glad to have had the opportunity to try this at a discount for an honest opinion.  It&#x27;s so hard to find good brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are my own opinions and I have not been compensated for them.</li>
            <li> Very hard to find a round brush with a larger barrel that doesn&#x27;t pull your hair. Already had this same style brush( purchased several years prior) and thought I should have a backup.  As they say timing is everything, last week the original brush fell off the sink and the handle broke off when it hit the floor. Good thing that I had purchased this one.</li>
            <li> i used this brush once and it worked great, but today it broke while my 12 year old was holding it.  she was standing in front of me when it happened so i know she wasn&#x27;t being rough with it.  the handle just broke right off.  use with care.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this brush for a while now. It does a great job drying my hair. However after prolonged use, Some of the black coating evidently peels off of the brush And it appears in your hair as you brush is out. That is my only complaint about this brush. I really like the circumference of the barrel. I wish it didn&#x27;t peel- It would be worth five stars then.</li>
            <li> Absolutely one of the best brushes I have used to Date! I have curly hair and must brushes are extremely painful when combing through it but this was is amazing and painless!</li>
            <li> Great brush. The bristles are awesome, and I love the grip. I use this as my &amp;#34;hair dryer brush&amp;#34; since it adds a great amount of volume to my hair. I&#x27;m definitely a fan :)</li>
            <li> It feels like a gentle scalp massage every time I use it! Love it; will buy again when needed.</li>
            <li> Used it for the first time yesterday. Easy to use and hair doesn&#x27;t tangle</li>
            <li> worth for the price but its very Big size</li>
            <li> Unbeatable price (special offer) and gives long hair a nice lift after blow-drying</li>
            <li> Not good at all, but it&#x27;s only 99 c, so ...</li>
            <li> Oh Revlon, I just love you so much for creating this brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair has always kind of been a disaster. It is not straight, not curly, not really even wavy. Plus, it&#x27;s very prone to frizz. All great things, obviously.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I never knew what to do with it, so I always let it air-dry, which never looked great. I decided to purchase this brush and start blowing out my hair, and this brush has just absolutely done wonders. Because of the thermal, it dries my hair (armpit length) very quickly. It gives my hair volume and bounce like I&#x27;ve never seen before. My hair is suddenly shiny and stylish instead of dull and blah.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i might be giving the brush too much credit, but hey, it&#x27;s worth a shot.</li>
            <li> I was very sceptic to buy this type of hair brush but all i have to say it is amazing! I have really&lt;br /&gt;Long hair and it did the job from roots to end, deff will buy another if i have too. This is My new favorite from now till forever. Thank u!!!&#x27;</li>
            <li> Love it, my hair is thick, wavy and kind of course and this brush has helped so much! This is one of the best brush&#x27;s I have used. Great for those of us who like to straighten with a flat iron, this will help so much!</li>
            <li> Great item, just like description, what i want.&lt;br /&gt;highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Love the brush but expect something of this cost to hold up longer than 2 months. I&#x27;m pretty disappointed, but I glued it back together.</li>
            <li> The handle broke off after a few months and I had to throw it away.</li>
            <li> Great brush for an amazing price.</li>
            <li> I went to use this hairbrush and it is awful!  The bristles are so short that I can&#x27;t get them to hold onto the hair so it can do any curling.  I have fine hair, so it should be no problem, but no luck.  The hair just falls off of it, with no grip.  I&#x27;m sending it back.</li>
            <li> Very nice brush and does not get tangedl easily in my hair like some do... I have naturally curly hair and sometimes a round brush ends up just getting tangled and damages my hair but I actually really like this one.</li>
            <li> Very fast delivery, really good .&lt;br /&gt;In addition , the size is larger than expected. Gives the hair combed like a charm. Very good product !</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE this brush especially the price I paid for it!!!</li>
            <li> My other brushes handles are always breaking because my hair is so thick, this brush really holds up against thick curly hair and i feel like it helped dry my hair more evenly with the holes when blow drying. I am very pleased with this purchase</li>
            <li> Love this brush! Straightens my hair easily without getting stuck in my hair also leaves it nice and soft.</li>
            <li> My daughter like this.</li>
