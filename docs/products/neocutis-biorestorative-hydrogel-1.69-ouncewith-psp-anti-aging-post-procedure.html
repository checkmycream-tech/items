            <li> but, when the weather gets really dry, I put La Mer over the gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Adds moisture quick!  Use it day and night.</li>
            <li> Whenever i apply this product to my face , my skin smiles , shines, brightness... It really restores the skin and this is exactly what i need...</li>
            <li> I decided to try the gel but have decided I like the moisture the cream adds to my skin.  The product still provides the same anti-aging properties.</li>
            <li> Just a tad too pricey.</li>
            <li> Previoulsy, I used this product recommended by my dermatologist at an alarming office price.  I purchased it here for less than half the price. Immediately you can tell the difference once applied.  Great product.  Shipped fast.  I would recommend this product for all skin types as part of your facial regimen.</li>
            <li> I had a very ugly fast growing growth removed from my forehead recently. My daughter gave me the remainder of a tube of Bio-gel. I was amazed at the way this wound healed. Being a woman I was very worried about the scar that could have been a focal point to onlookers. Other than a small indention, it is not even noticeable. I couldn&#x27;t be happier! I ordered my own Bio-Gel from Amazon at a discounted price and will keep this on hand.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. I was so pleased to find it on Amazon &amp; for such a great price. The product was shipped quickly. No problems at all. I&#x27;ll continue to purchase this product through Amazon as long as it is available!</li>
            <li> As with all Neocutis products, it&#x27;s free of DMAE and very pure. I highly recommend this product as part of a daily routine.</li>
            <li> I started using the Neocutis line on recommendation by my dermatologist.  This hydrogel is a great product - cool, clear, light and effective.  I have very sensitive skin and I don&#x27;t need an oily product - this is both soothing and non-oily.  With use over time, my skin feels firmer and has fewer fine lines.  I notice it also helps to heal my blemishes - I&#x27;m not saying it prevents blemishes, it&#x27;s just healing.  That makes sense because they originally researched PSP for healing wounds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unlike products that simply hydrate and \\&quot;plump\\&quot; the skin, the results of using PSP are longer lasting.  However, the gel may not be as moisturizing as some expect.  This gel contains hyaluronic acid, which is hydrating, but it does not contain a creamy or oily shield to keep moisture in.  I don&#x27;t know if it is recommended but, when the weather gets really dry, I put La Mer over the gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price is great - I&#x27;ve seen this size on sale for $185.</li>
            <li> I love this product. If your face tends to break out with creams, then this product is for you. It is a gel and there is no oily residue. I can say only good things about this product.</li>
            <li> Excellent hydro-gel for combination skin.  I love Neocutis products and have always had very good results.  My skin is very sensitive, yet I have never had a reaction to any Neocutis products.  I also like many of the Eminence products as well.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product. However, you get what you pay for. These products are not supposed to be sold online. They require a physician to sell them. You have no idea if the product is expired, if its actually what its supposed to be. You have no idea if its been stored properly or if it remains effective. I see it all the time. Don&#x27;t cheat yourself. There is no way they can be sold for these prices and be good, believe me I know how much it cost a seller to buy them and they would not make any money.</li>
            <li> I always have this product with me every since my dermatologist recommend. I love it! It is light weight, and leaves my skin feeling hydrated without being “cakey”</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for several years.  I find it does keep my face firmer if I use it every day.</li>
            <li> A very nice, light gel.</li>
            <li> Have used this for years with excellent results.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what I did for my skin before this product.  It makes my moisturizer work better and it makes my skin feel soft and healthy.  I ran out of it and I could tell the difference in less than two days.  Love this gel!! (gel last longer then the cream)</li>
            <li> great product, easy to use, and effective.  Will continue to use!  Love all the Neocutis products.  Hope the anti-aging is all it is cracked up to be!</li>
            <li> The gel is non-greasy &amp; goes into the skin almost immediately.  I&#x27;ve only been using it for a week so I can&#x27;t give any long term effects on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;I do miss the &amp;#34;dewey&amp;#34; look that I got from the Neocutis Biorestorative cream. Perhaps I was using that  too often because I began to get a few small white bumps on my face.  Which is why I&#x27;m giving the gel a chance.</li>
            <li> My dermotoligist recommended this highly about ten years ago and I&#x27;ve been using it ever since. I can&#x27;t be sure it&#x27;s the reason but people are shocked at my age and keep telling me not to tell my age anymore because I look more than 10 years younger than I am.</li>
            <li> My skin is extremely sensitive, and very prone to breakouts. The gel is so lightweight, it feels like you have put almost nothing on - yet your skin feels soft and moisturized. I&#x27;ve used it for a few months now and have noticed a decrease in breakouts, as well as dry skin. There is not much of a smell to the product that I have noticed. Just a clear odorless gel.</li>
            <li> It is light weight. Works great under make up. It moisturizes without causing breakouts. Great on combination skin. I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  Best out of all the moisturizers I&#x27;ve used.  Great for sensitive skin and doesn&#x27;t make u break out. Don&#x27;t hesitate to buy this product.  Always ships promptly.</li>
            <li> I had extensive plastic surgery for my saggy neck and droopy upper eyelids. A month after healing, I asked him for his product endorsement. He strongly recommended Bio-Gel at a cost of $190.00 for 1.69 oz. As he did such an amazing job on my face, I assumed he would not lead me astray on a product. First, the price was DOUBLE+ Amazon or a few on-line companies. Second, the product does NOTHING! I see no diminshing of fine lines, no scar reduction, no hydration of the skin. And worst of all, I paid more than I had planned to ever spend on facial anti-aging gel. I would not buy it if it was $15.00 at the corner pharmacy. Shame on me for getting ripped off. I hope I can help someone else save their money.I would recommend the plastic surgeon. Those of you using Neocutis Bio-Gel post surgery, getting compliments...its probably NOT the product but the plastic surgery you had done.</li>
            <li> For those of you who are pro life this product contains an ingredient by the name of Processed Skin Cell Proteins, or PSP which comes from medically donated aborted human fetuses. Meaning the cells are from human babies who have been essentially killed from their mother&#x27;s wombs with the consent of the mother and then processed to make beauty creams. Most of the line of this brand contains this ingredient, so if you are pro life or just find it creepy where the ingredient comes from I recommend you do not buy this product. If you are still skeptical about this review I invite you to take a moment of your time to investigate this on your own. Thank you.</li>
            <li> Great face gel with no oily residue left after applied. :)</li>
            <li> This provides light hydration. Its not greasy at all and causes no breakouts! Im hoping this will help change the texture of my skin.</li>
            <li> Great for sensitive, mature, or post procedure skin. Expensive. Don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll purchase again although I haven&#x27;t found a bettter product.</li>
            <li> Very moisturizing, but makes my face break out in small white heads.  Supposedly this product heals the skin after surgery and is an amazing moisturizer.  I&#x27;ve been using it for three months now continuously, but have to use it only at night, then wash it off completely in the am.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.  There&#x27;s something not quite right with these Neocutis products being&lt;br /&gt;sold on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;The consistency used in this Necocutis product is not the same consistency, and does not have&lt;br /&gt;near the same results of the same product I bought through a dermatologist, as per a prescription.&lt;br /&gt; You get what you pay for.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t waste your money,  even though reviews here say it&#x27;s working,&lt;br /&gt;because even if it is &amp;#34;working&amp;#34;, guaranteed, it&#x27;s to a far lesser degree.</li>
            <li> I bought this twice, thinking I needed more time with it. I don&#x27;t like wasting money on products that don&#x27;t deliver</li>
