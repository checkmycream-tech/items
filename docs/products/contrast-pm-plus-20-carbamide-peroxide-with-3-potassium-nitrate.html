            <li>He DID say that there were stronger percentages, but also assured me that the 20%/3% was the one that was the best &#x27;bang for your buck&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I can not believe how great this stuff works!</li>
            <li>This is working great!</li>
            <li>Whitens perfectly.</li>
            <li>It does the trick at a very good price!</li>
            <li>Product arrived on time as promised and is an excellent choice.</li>
            <li>This product costs $45 at our dentist&#x27;s office so this is a very good value.</li>
            <li>I get great results from this product very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li>Great product and great experience.</li>
            <li>I have used this product before and got great result.  </li>
            <li>lol</li>
            <li>My results were great.</li>
            <li>This product works great</li>
            <li>Great product.  </li>
            <li>Great Product, I always purchase from this company.</li>
            <li>Not as good as without 3% Potassium Nitrate</li>
            <li>When using it for the first time it is the best to over night for 2 consecutive weeks.</li>
            <li>In fact this reminds me I need to order more!</li>
            <li>The 20% was a great fit for me.</li>
            <li>so I ordered more of this to use until my procedure at night with the trays the dentist gave me.</li>
            <li>We have used this product for many years to touch up our teeth after they are cleaned at the dentist.  </li>
            <li>Love this...</li>
            <li>I originally got this product from my dentist and it works well but ordering it online is much more affordable!  </li>
            <li>I really like use this as a great maintenance on my teeth whitening</li>
            <li>it burned my gums and I wasn&#x27;t able to use all the treatment continuously as indicated.</li>
            <li>This is a good product and it&#x27;s priced very well.</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t experience any sensitivity, and the gel whitened my teeth very quickly.</li>
            <li>find the best way to use it is with my clear plastic retainer, which are a much tighter fit than any of the mouthguard like plastic molds on amazon.</li>
            <li>I am now on my 5th consecutive night of using Contrast PM and whilst there is a mild tingling through the day, it is certainly more than bearable by comparison.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s pretty strong, lower strength is better to sleep all night.</li>
            <li>Great Results, Does not hurt and lasts for a long time!</li>
            <li>bright white..</li>
            <li>You really have to be sure not to swallow any of your saliva while using this though, as it will really irritate your stomach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I used it for 1-2 hours each day for the 8 days and my teeth got much whiter.</li>
            <li>your teeth will be very sensitive but it melts off all your plaque and brightens your teeth like a piece of paper!</li>
            <li>I would recommend highly to my friends and family.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I could barely use the opalessence for more than 2 days in a row due to the severe tingling sensation, verging on pain!</li>
            <li>I once tried to use 22% and it was itchy and made my teeth very sensitive.</li>
            <li>is the exact same stuff for a fraction of the cost from the dentist.</li>
            <li>If you have sensitive teeth go for the 15%, the 20% is what I am using because I have a limited time to get them the color I want and it does leave my teeth sensitive</li>
            <li>the time it takes is pretty similar to other products</li>
            <li>Perhaps this supplier makes a different custom declaration, I&#x27;m not sure, but it was still worth it for me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I live in the UK and this product was hit with customs duty before it arrived meaning I had to pay a further £14 before I could get it - this has never happened when ordering the other whitener which I have done on several occasions.</li>

            <li> Great product and great experience.</li>
            <li> Not as good as without 3% Potassium Nitrate</li>
            <li> I was fitted for mouth trays by my dentist and he referred me to this whitener. He DID say that there were stronger percentages, but also assured me that the 20%/3% was the one that was the best &#x27;bang for your buck&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t experience any sensitivity, and the gel whitened my teeth very quickly. Would definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> I have used this product before and got great result.  Will use it again.</li>
            <li> Definitely helps (comes in different strengths)</li>
            <li> I can not believe how great this stuff works! its RX strength. just put a little dot in each tooth spot on your trays and then go to sleep. your teeth will be very sensitive but it melts off all your plaque and brightens your teeth like a piece of paper! movie star bright white..lol no joke this stuff is the 200 dollar stuff you get from the dentist</li>
            <li> I get great results from this product very happy with my purchase. I would recommend highly to my friends and family.</li>
            <li> I have had severly stained yellow teeth, I had zoom whitening done at the dentist (worst pain ever) it did brighten my teeth several shades which is what I wanted but they weren&#x27;t quite white enough. I am having 4 front crowns done in a week and really do not want them to be yellow so I ordered more of this to use until my procedure at night with the trays the dentist gave me. This is working great! If you have sensitive teeth go for the 15%, the 20% is what I am using because I have a limited time to get them the color I want and it does leave my teeth sensitive but there is an end in sight.&lt;br /&gt;This is the exact same stuff for a fraction of the cost from the dentist.</li>
            <li> Great Results, Does not hurt and lasts for a long time! I highly recommend this product. When using it for the first time it is the best to over night for 2 consecutive weeks. My results were great. Every year or half-year I maintain my &amp;#34;Colgate-smile&amp;#34; and use Contrast PM for a few nights only. The 20% was a great fit for me. I once tried to use 22% and it was itchy and made my teeth very sensitive.</li>
            <li> Will never buy from dentist again! Amazon is the way to go.  This product works great, it&#x27;s pretty strong, lower strength is better to sleep all night.</li>
            <li> We have used this product for many years to touch up our teeth after they are cleaned at the dentist.  This product costs $45 at our dentist&#x27;s office so this is a very good value.</li>
            <li> Love this...my teeth is as white as snow</li>
            <li> I originally got this product from my dentist and it works well but ordering it online is much more affordable!  In fact this reminds me I need to order more!</li>
            <li> I am giving this product 5 stars. I have used a couple of other products prior to this - the way it whitens the teeth and the time it takes is pretty similar to other products (Opalessence is what I have been using previously) but for me the biggest difference is the lack of tingling with my teeth whilst bleaching.  I could barely use the opalessence for more than 2 days in a row due to the severe tingling sensation, verging on pain!

            <li> Great product.  Whitens perfectly.</li>
            <li> Works as described. You really have to be sure not to swallow any of your saliva while using this though, as it will really irritate your stomach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find the best way to use it is with my clear plastic retainer, which are a much tighter fit than any of the mouthguard like plastic molds on amazon.</li>
            <li> Ein tolles Produkt White Whiter am Whitersten Gruß Gerhard</li>
            <li> Great Product, I always purchase from this company. I&#x27;m always receiving compliments on how white my teeth are.</li>
            <li> It does the trick at a very good price!</li>
            <li> I really like use this as a great maintenance on my teeth whitening</li>
            <li> Product arrived on time as promised and is an excellent choice.</li>
            <li> This is a good product and it&#x27;s priced very well. I didn&#x27;t develop any tooth sensitivity, but I didn&#x27;t wear it overnight. I used it for 1-2 hours each day for the 8 days and my teeth got much whiter. I will purchase this product again to maintain white teeth.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe it takes 4-6 hrs  - I didn&#x27;t expect that&lt;br /&gt;Also it burned my gums and I wasn&#x27;t able to use all the treatment continuously as indicated. - because of the time and the gum issue was not what I was expecting - I did have results but not the ones that I wanted.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll try the 36% that only takes like 5 min..I don&#x27;t have the time to quietly wait.</li>
