            <li>Great product for the hair particularly to help strengthening and manage damaged hair</li>
            <li>great conditioner made my hair very soft and easy to manage.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t usually make reviews, but I just had to make one for this product because I honestly think this may be one of the best conditioners out there for afro-textured hair like mine.</li>
            <li>but my friend says it is a great product, makes her hair soft and</li>
            <li>the smell was very mild not like garlic at all  </li>
            <li>with quick!</li>
            <li>I tried Alter Ego Garlic Hot Oil Treatment and first of all it does not smell like garlic, but has a very pleasant smell and when you mush it all in your scalp and hair, your hair becomes soft like butter!  </li>
            <li>The conditioning treatment helps to strenghthens the hair and keeps it full of body.  </li>
            <li>It smells lovely and it makes my hair so soft!</li>
            <li>shipment was very fast</li>
            <li>Then, when you blow out your hair, it&#x27;s soft, shiny, bouncy and smells fresh and clean.  </li>
            <li>First of all, there is NO garlic smell.</li>
            <li>This is a fantastic conditioner it helps prevent shedding and leaves your hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>I use it every four weeks to give my relaxed 4b hair type the extra love it needs to get through.</li>
            <li>My hair has been healthy and definitely started growing since I started to use this product!</li>
            <li>i ordered this conditioning treatment and received the hot oil</li>
            <li>I was told about this conditioner many times but took me a long time to give it a try.  </li>
            <li>my hair feels super soft after use.  </li>
            <li>My hair comes out very flowy and manageable.</li>
            <li>I had so many damaging chemicals put on my hair, that it was just mush and breaking off when it was wet.  </li>
            <li>It can leave hair very greasy if you don&#x27;t rinse very well.  </li>
            <li>I have very curly and frizzy hair.</li>
            <li>I really can&#x27;t think of any cons for this product because I notice that my hair looks healthier, fuller, and feels softer after I began using it.</li>
            <li>better than the other gunk i use</li>
            <li>It makes my curls more defined and there is less frizz.</li>

            <li>When you think you have rinsed completely rinse again.  </li>
            <li>My hair is borderline mature</li>
            <li>Product keeps the hair moisturized, soft, shiny and helps reduce breakage.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> worked well as usual no complaints</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner.  I conditioner my hair once a week and I love the way this conditioner makes my hair feel.  It&#x27;s a great value for the money and it doesn&#x27;t smell like garlic at all.</li>
            <li> This site sells this product cheaper than the beauty supply stores!  I read all the reviews and decided to invest because I purchased MT and garlic pills.  When I do my co wash I detangle then rinse out conditioner then apply MT and Aphogee essential oils to my scalp wait a few min. Rinse out and apply Alter Ego.  It smells good and my hair is stronger after use.  I will continue to buy this oil treatment forever. I love it!</li>
            <li> LOVE IT!!! even use it on a daily as hair creme to weight my hair down...better than the other gunk i use &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for over 5 years now and its kept my hair shiny and healthy. It&#x27;s never let me down!</li>
            <li> Hello all:  Hope everyone is well. I tried Alter Ego Garlic Hot Oil Treatment and first of all it does not smell like garlic, but has a very pleasant smell and when you mush it all in your scalp and hair, your hair becomes soft like butter!  It&#x27;s great!  Then, when you blow out your hair, it&#x27;s soft, shiny, bouncy and smells fresh and clean.  I keep a jar handy always.  After shampooing, just put on soaking wet hair and really massage in scalp and then hair.  You can also do a deep condition with it.  Instead of rinsing out, just leave it on and clip hair up and rinse out later.  It&#x27;s even better!  You can&#x27;t buy in stores, but only on line or in certain salons.  I&#x27;ll always purchase this.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> If you are seriously looking for a product that will make your hair look healthy and silky, definitely try this conditioner. I do use it in combination with other products such as Keracare hydrating shampoo, prowash leave-in conditioner and FHI flat iron protectant or biosilk.  I also leave the alter ego conditioner on (with a plastic cap) for as long as I can -- maybe an hour or two. If I am short on time I will sit under my dryer for 5-10 minutes. And then proceed as normal.  My hair comes out very flowy and manageable. If you are in search of something new and different that TRULY works, definitely give this a try.</li>
            <li> I had so many damaging chemicals put on my hair, that it was just mush and breaking off when it was wet.  This product is amazing, it has healed my hair over a one month span.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually make reviews, but I just had to make one for this product because I honestly think this may be one of the best conditioners out there for afro-textured hair like mine. I apply it after shampooing and sit under my soft bonnet dryer for about 15 minutes and rinse it out. It not only detangled my hair with ease, but it strengthened it and left my hair soft and shiny! I can&#x27;t believe it took me so long to try this conditioner! I absolutely love it and I will definitely be repurchasing this in the 1000mL size.</li>
            <li> I like this product, I have used it for two months and my hair is softer by far.  It can leave hair very greasy if you don&#x27;t rinse very well.  When you think you have rinsed completely rinse again.  Don&#x27;t worry it does NOT smell like garlic not even a little. I would buy it again even though its pricy its a great conditioner.  My hair is borderline mature so I need a conditioner that does what it claims.  I was buying Aveda and I like this much better.</li>
            <li> i use this 1or 2x/mnth when i want nice shiny hair. Works great. I blow dry my hair and have color and this is a great product.</li>
            <li> It leaves your hair soft and extremely moisturized.  I loved it and will continue to purchase it and use.  Works great on damaged hair.</li>

            <li> My daughter used it mostly. She said it was ok. Rated it 3.5 stars. It made her hair manageable and softer, but no drastic difference.</li>
            <li> I recommend conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;Good for split ends, adds volume and shine after one use.  This product is popular in all dominican salon</li>

            <li> Product keeps the hair moisturized, soft, shiny and helps reduce breakage.  It doesn&#x27;t smell like garlic to me and the ladies at the salon I go to (Dominican)swear by it.
