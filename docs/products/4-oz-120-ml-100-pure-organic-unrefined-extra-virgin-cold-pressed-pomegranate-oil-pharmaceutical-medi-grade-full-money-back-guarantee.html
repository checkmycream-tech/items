            <li> Pomegranates are well known to be great anti oxidants so when I saw it in an oil I knew I had to have it&lt;br /&gt;Although you can take it internally i have only rubbed it into my skin. I suffer with sensitive skin when using any creams or oils that is fragranced usually bit this is great. Not had any irritation at all&lt;br /&gt;For great skin buy this oil and a bargain at this price</li>
