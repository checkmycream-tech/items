            <li>Try it :)</li>

            <li>i love sigma products.</li>
            <li>I was going to buy a MAC brush (which is what most off my makeup brushes are),</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m so glad I saved some money on this one instead.</li>
            <li>I awnetd to love this brush</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s excellent quality, and the curved tip makes it easy to apply lipstick around the edges of your lip, especially in the Cupid&#x27;s bow area.  </li>
            <li>i am really excited to try more and more products from their line.</li>
            <li>The most comfortable ans softest lip brush I have ever used.</li>
            <li>but I make sure to wipe the brush with a tissue before storing to keep the inside clean.</li>
            <li>this is an amazing brush to apply your lipstick, lipgloss, it makes my life so much easier and i would recommend it 100%!</li>
            <li>it is smooth and easy to use...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the perfect size lip brush and love the option of short or long handle (put the cap on the end - it stays on place nicely) LOVE!</li>
            <li>It is compact with a nice silver lid, but when you open it up and put the lid on it becomes elongated for nice easy handling.  </li>
            <li>Was happy to find it on Amazon as I couldn&#x27;t find a lip brush in my local shops.</li>
            <li>Compact and fantastic quality.</li>
            <li>Now I understand why lipbrushes are important...</li>
            <li>they make lips fabulous</li>
            <li>I enjoy using it.</li>
            <li>Nice firm bristles allow for good application of lip color.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very soft, compact and nicely built.</li>
            <li>Applies lipstick very precisely, does not shed, and is very compact.  </li>
            <li>I think this brush does a good job applying the lipsticks evenly and would definitely buy again.</li>
            <li>Makes reapplication so much easier and more convenient.</li>
            <li>I think she liked the freebie brush a little more!</li>
            <li>The bristles are nice and firm, too, and the cover keeps it nice and clean in your purse.  </li>
            <li>This is a great little brush to keep on the go.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so worth the money.</li>
            <li>I especially like the way it encases the brush portion to make it nice for travel or to be carried in a purse.</li>
            <li>The price is right too.</li>
            <li>Thank you very much</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good little brush.  </li>
            <li>The design of this brush is both innovative and simple.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have any experience with higher brands</li>
            <li>I really like that it also has lid.  </li>
            <li>I really like this brush</li>
            <li>That really made my day.</li>
            <li>results  better than I expected  </li>
            <li>Good price compared to other lip brushes that are similar in description.  </li>
            <li>This brush works better than any other I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>the way it is designed the Sigma Lip Brush is small enough to fit in my cosmetic bag easily but full length when i put it together to use it...</li>
            <li>I mainly use it without the cap.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I love this little brush.  </li>
            <li>The brush is small enough to fit comfortably in my makeup bag.  </li>
            <li>This is one of my new favourite brushes.</li>
            <li>The bristles are very soft, and can tell it was well crafted.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s stiff enough to get a nice line around your lips, but feels very soft.  </li>
            <li>It by far exceeded my expectations.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve recently discovered the Sigma line of brushes and can highly recommend them.  </li>
            <li>I had been saving my lipstick tubes, not wanting to waste the rest of the relatively expensive lipstick that was down inside them, and the moderate cost of this brush is more than justified by being able to use up these lipsticks.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new to the world of makeup, especially lipstick...</li>
            <li>I have been looking for a lip brush that is small enough to carry in my makeup bag, but with a handle that is comfortable to use.  </li>
            <li>When I put the lid on the end and try to use it that way so that it&#x27;s long, the lid does not stay on, so I have to use it with the lid completely off.  </li>

            <li> It&#x27;s stiff enough to spread product without poking my lips.</li>
            <li> Just like any other lip brush works well</li>
            <li> but to me it&#x27;s not worth the price.</li>
            <li> , unfortunately it doesn&#x27;t work with really matte lipstick (like retro mattes from MAC).</li>
            <li> (Mostly because I hate the way some lipsticks are put on heavily and thickly.)</li>
            <li> It also came with a mini \\&quot;dupe\\&quot; brush compared to the MAC E25 (I mag be wrong about exact number sorry!!!)</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Just what I wanted. Was happy to find it on Amazon as I couldn&#x27;t find a lip brush in my local shops. Some might object to the fact that it doesn&#x27;t retract, but I don&#x27;t have an issue with that.</li>
            <li> A really nice lip brush.  Applies lipstick very precisely, does not shed, and is very compact.  I had been saving my lipstick tubes, not wanting to waste the rest of the relatively expensive lipstick that was down inside them, and the moderate cost of this brush is more than justified by being able to use up these lipsticks.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> very handy for on-the-go use!</li>
            <li> I only use Sigma brushes because they are wonderful and they get the job done beautifully and the price is reasonable.  This brush is perfect for applying lipstick and glosses.  Well done, Sigma.</li>
            <li> Compact and fantastic quality. This brush works better than any other I&#x27;ve tried. Since it can contain it self you don&#x27;t need to ever buy a travel size. Perfect for makeup enthusiasts and busy working women.</li>
            <li> This is only the 2nd lip brush I have ever purchased. It&#x27;s stiff enough to spread product without poking my lips. I didn&#x27;t read in the description before I bought it that the handle separates and creates a case. I like that, but I make sure to wipe the brush with a tissue before storing to keep the inside clean.</li>
            <li> This is one of my new favourite brushes. It&#x27;s so worth the money.</li>
            <li> Have one for myself and have bought two more as gifts. It&#x27;s the perfect size lip brush and love the option of short or long handle (put the cap on the end - it stays on place nicely) LOVE!</li>
            <li> This is the only Sigma brush I have but I like it. I especially like the way it encases the brush portion to make it nice for travel or to be carried in a purse.</li>
            <li> When I put the lid on the end and try to use it that way so that it&#x27;s long, the lid does not stay on, so I have to use it with the lid completely off.  It&#x27;s no problem if you don&#x27;t mind using it really short (3 to 3.5 inches), but to me it&#x27;s not worth the price.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good little brush.  Nice firm bristles allow for good application of lip color.  I really like that it also has lid.  I&#x27;ve recently discovered the Sigma line of brushes and can highly recommend them.  I now have a nice variety of them.  The price is right too.</li>
            <li> Great brush.  Received as described. Cap does come off sometimes, but might be a user issue.  I mainly use it without the cap.  Good price compared to other lip brushes that are similar in description.  I have not owned it long enough to review how it will handle long term use.</li>
            <li> I love this brush.  It&#x27;s stiff enough to get a nice line around your lips, but feels very soft.  It has a nice top that comes with it, so is great for carrying in your purse.</li>
            <li> This is a great little brush to keep on the go.  I love that it has a lid and that lid becomes part of the handle.</li>
            <li> I bought this on a whim after repeatedly reminding myself I needed a lip brush. (Mostly because I hate the way some lipsticks are put on heavily and thickly.) I think this brush does a good job applying the lipsticks evenly and would definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> JUST BUY ANY SIGMA BRUSH, YOU WONT REGRET IT. THEY ALL WORK GUD. I AM A HAPPY CUSTOMER AND I WILL BUY THESE AGAIN!!!!</li>
            <li> I really like this brush, unfortunately it doesn&#x27;t work with really matte lipstick (like retro mattes from MAC). So I tried using it as a concealer brush and its awesome!! Try it :)</li>
            <li> I was a little hesitant to purchase the lip brush but was pleasantly surprised when it came. It by far exceeded my expectations. I love the handle that is also used over the brush tip for travel. Makes reapplication so much easier and more convenient.</li>
            <li> Just like any other lip brush works well ,i don&#x27;t have any complaints item isn&#x27;t flimsy and is just what i wanted</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a lip brush that is small enough to carry in my makeup bag, but with a handle that is comfortable to use.  I finally found what I was looking for in the Sigma L05 lip brush.  The design of this brush is both innovative and simple.  The cap protects the brush.  The brush is small enough to fit comfortably in my makeup bag.  The cap fits onto the end of the brush handle and turns the brush into a full-size lip brush.  Could it get any better?  Oh wait, yes it can!  This lip brush does shed bristles when I use it!</li>
            <li> Great quality!! Best brand on brushes no doubt about it!! Your money is going to be well spend! Love it</li>
            <li> The most comfortable ans softest lip brush I have ever used.</li>
            <li> Excellant brush. Makes a big differance in how my lipstick looks. A actually use it to apply lipstick not gloss</li>
            <li> I love this little brush.  It is compact with a nice silver lid, but when you open it up and put the lid on it becomes elongated for nice easy handling.  Perfect for on the go!  Great product!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to the world of makeup, especially lipstick... but this brush seems absolutely perfect. It&#x27;s going to take some getting used to. It&#x27;s very soft, compact and nicely built. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s going to shed at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;AND they included a free blender brush! That really made my day. &amp;lt;3&amp;lt;3&amp;lt;3</li>
            <li> I did not receive the product I ordered. Instead I was mailed just the cap to the lip brush and no brush. Amazon was wonderful to work with regarding this issue.</li>
            <li> this brush is perfect for outlining the lips, and then filling them in with color. great tool better than other lip brushes i have tried, perfect!</li>
            <li> the lip brush is excellent quality leaves a beautiful finish I use it every day I love Thank you very much</li>
            <li> Very smooth and picks up color well. very easy to apply and helps lipstick stay on longer. I don&#x27;t have any experience with higher brands so I am not sure how it compares but for the price it works very well.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend decided to order this brush. She is in love with it. The bristles are very soft, and can tell it was well crafted. It also came with a mini \\&quot;dupe\\&quot; brush compared to the MAC E25 (I mag be wrong about exact number sorry!!!) and she was THRILLED about it. I think she liked the freebie brush a little more!</li>
            <li> I am really satisfied with this purchase. i love sigma products. this is an amazing brush to apply your lipstick, lipgloss, it makes my life so much easier and i would recommend it 100%! i am obsessed with sigma products and as this arrived i ordered more sigma brushes. i am really excited to try more and more products from their line.</li>
            <li> Não tinha nenhum pincel de boca e esse é muito bom! Prático para levar na bolsa! Recomendo esse e todos os outros pinceis da Sigma!</li>
            <li> really a good product..it is smooth and easy to use...results  better than I expected  Now I understand why lipbrushes are important...they make lips fabulous</li>
            <li> the way it is designed the Sigma Lip Brush is small enough to fit in my cosmetic bag easily but full length when i put it together to use it...also brush is right firmness to apply lipstick well and smoothly...very happy with this purchase</li>
            <li> a beautiful lip liner. I enjoy using it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard great hinge about Sigma brushes, but this is the first one I&#x27;ve purchased. It&#x27;s excellent quality, and the curved tip makes it easy to apply lipstick around the edges of your lip, especially in the Cupid&#x27;s bow area.  The bristles are nice and firm, too, and the cover keeps it nice and clean in your purse.  I was going to buy a MAC brush (which is what most off my makeup brushes are), but I&#x27;m so glad I saved some money on this one instead.</li>
            <li> I awnetd to love this brush but after a few uses it doesn&#x27;t do much. Doesn&#x27;t pick up product as well as I would like.</li>
