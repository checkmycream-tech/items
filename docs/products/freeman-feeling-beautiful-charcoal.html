            <li>I love the way my skin feels after using this!!!!</li>
            <li>Has been working great!</li>
            <li>This is the best mask I&#x27;ve ever applied.</li>
            <li>It is incredibly grainy and should not be even considered a mask at all!</li>
            <li>this gives me a perfect balance of moisture.</li>
            <li>Excellent.</li>
            <li>Smells great too!</li>
            <li>It has a self heating mechanism so it feels wonderful on your face.</li>
            <li>but my skin can take it and looks and feels great afterwards!</li>
            <li>So happy I checked Amazon!!</li>

            <li>This product doesn&#x27;t smell either - Very happy with the results.</li>
            <li>I suggest that those complaining of it doing so research carrier oils and decide which is the best match for their skin type and needs and use it nightly-ESPECIALLY after using this.</li>
            <li>Fab product, works the very best of anything I&#x27;ve tried over the years, even ProActive.</li>
            <li>But as a scrub, it is excellent.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s best used like a gommage and the sugar in it disolves in water, so no sticky residue or difficulty rinsing off!</li>
            <li>This is the best I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>My skin feels and smells wonderful after using this product.</li>

            <li>This stuff is AMAZING!</li>
            <li>The product is AMAZING!</li>
            <li>But, I just wanted to put it out there - while many people have great things to say about this (and maybe you will too!)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more of a scrub than a mask, but either way it made my skin feel great!</li>
            <li>If you can, spring water supplies the most benefits, hands down.research carrier oils and decide which is the best match for their skin type and needs and use it nightly-ESPECIALLY after using this.</li>
            <li>The smell was pleasant.</li>
            <li>It smells pleasant and makes my skin feel softer and SMOOTHER than any product I have tried.</li>
            <li>my skin feel so good after using this.</li>
            <li>It does feel good, though.</li>
            <li>I bought this thinking it would be good...</li>
            <li>feels good</li>
            <li>I read that charcoal masks were really good to control acne, so wanted to give charcoal a go.  </li>
            <li>It feels so nice when you put it on and it leaves your face feeling great</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kept my skin from overdrying and from getting too oily- a good balance for about 2 days after use.</li>
            <li>and I loved it.</li>
            <li>You can rest assured that you are getting a good exfoliation—</li>
            <li>Good product I&#x27;ve had a problem  </li>
            <li>clean/smooth smells good and taste good as well</li>
            <li>Good cleaner</li>
            <li>I have fair skin</li>
            <li>i purchased this mask along with freeman&#x27;s avocado and oatmeal mask, i had heard good things about charcoal for acne prone skin</li>
            <li>It is that good to me.</li>
            <li>This is a good product.  </li>
            <li>this smells so good</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good for washing your face but for some reason it&#x27;s not getting rid of my blackheads?</li>
            <li>Smells good.</li>
            <li>I would say this product would be good for a teenager that&#x27;s dealing with excess oil.  </li>
            <li>It smells good too.</li>
            <li>I have oily skin that is prone to breakouts and blackheads, I also have a fair complexion.  </li>
            <li>Great for those mornings/afternoons/evenings were you want to be in a nice bubble bath and relax.</li>
            <li>While it sounds good in theory in practice its not the easiest to apply.  </li>
            <li>It is so good.</li>
            <li>I am so happy I found a product that is easy on the wallet but still works!</li>
            <li>Love it, love it, love it!!!</li>
            <li>Wish it had been called &amp;#34;scrub&amp;#34; rather than &amp;#34;mask.&amp;#34; I think it is great as a scrub, but it does not stick to my face like I would expect of a coal mask, definitely more on the sugar side.</li>
            <li>Very refreshing on my skin.</li>
            <li>While this does make my skin feel great after I use it, I would classify it more as a scrub than a mask.</li>
            <li>Good price and nice results.</li>
            <li>really makes my face feel good, great expholiator!</li>
            <li>I use charcoal soap that works great, so I thought it would be a good fit.</li>

            <li>- Use after shower or have a damp warm face</li>
            <li>it is actually a nice moisturizing sugar scrub.  </li>
            <li>Feels warm going on.</li>
            <li>When you scrub on your face, it heats up and gets really warm, it&#x27;s so neat.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s kind of a burny tingle when u put it on, I like though.</li>
            <li>When you spread it on it heats up nicely.</li>
            <li>they are effective and dirt</li>
            <li>It was kind of soothing and warm.</li>
            <li>The product has a nice scent and is affordable.</li>
            <li>When I put it on, I feel a warm sensation on my face.</li>
            <li>Really nice cleaning product.  </li>
            <li>then i noticed that it felt kinda warm</li>
            <li>It has kind of a warming sensation, which I liked.</li>
            <li>Everyone always mentions how nice my skin has been looking lately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I am already getting compliments on how nice my skin looks.</li>
            <li>I let it set for about 5 minutes then began to exfoliate as directed, washed with warm water and</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve read so many good reviews about this mask</li>
            <li>and I feel like I have tried every kind of product out there.</li>
            <li>When you put it on it makes your skin feel warm.</li>
            <li>But as a scrub I liked it.  </li>
            <li>The mask starts to feel warm when you rub it in</li>
            <li>scrubbed with a bit of warm water and washed off.</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s kind of the idea</li>
            <li>I really liked that there is charcoal in this</li>
            <li>kind of replaced my st Ives scrub.</li>
            <li>It has a nice warming sensation when on the skin.  </li>
            <li>so even is really nice.  </li>
            <li>When I used it, it had this nice warming sensation, which made me assume it was working.</li>
            <li>if you try to spread it, you kind of end up wiping it off instead.</li>
            <li>and it also has a nice fragrance.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This scrub/mask is the perfect consistency to me; it&#x27;s really grainy and feels like it&#x27;s getting the job done.</li>
            <li>I roll onto my face and it gets warm.</li>
            <li>love this smells good too</li>
            <li>This one was suggested by my best buddy with plain flawless skin!</li>
            <li>Very impressed, skin feels clean and smooth.</li>
            <li>Works great with my Gurin Face and Body Ultra Clean Brush 4-in-1 SPA Cleansing System</li>
            <li>do highly recommend this delightful 2-in-1 mask.</li>
            <li>best scrub i have used and gives me such a bright complexion im brown skin</li>
            <li>The product comes over very easy as well.</li>
            <li>thats ok because I still love how it works!</li>
            <li>Works great, after the first use my face was smooth and felt great.</li>
            <li>Tastes pretty good if it rinses into your mouth, but, of course, don&#x27;t ingest it!</li>
            <li>THE best &amp;  mostly ALL natural !!</li>
            <li>soft and flawless looking like this stuff!</li>
            <li>Love that it gets warm when it&#x27;s on.</li>
            <li>liked this mask mostly for the exfoliating effect the sugar has.</li>
            <li>/&gt;4/5 stars, I liked this product but Ididn&#x27;t love it,</li>
            <li>I need to repurchase this, it was fun to use and smelled great, and I feel like it thoroughly cleaned my face without being overly abrasive.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve made my own sugar scrubs better than this.  </li>
            <li>My skin is so soft and looks great!!!</li>
            <li>this was not one of the best choices i made as far as skin care.</li>
            <li>most amazing mask ive ever used.</li>
            <li>Really good value and smelled pretty good.</li>
            <li>It feels so wonderful to rub it on my skin and it smells great and has a slight warming tingly feeling too.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m super happy :)</li>
            <li>it made my skin feel very smooth and made my moisturizer more effective.</li>
            <li>it has very nice ,fresh smell .</li>
            <li>It is awesome, my skin was instantly soft and looked better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty happy with it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This product goes on to the skin very smooth which is a plus for me.</li>
            <li>The product has a very light citrus smell almost like grapefruit</li>
            <li>The pinkness immediately subsided and my skin felt very smooth.  </li>
            <li>My face was baby smooth, incredible really!</li>
            <li>It has a nice smell and is so easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>it feels really good when you put it on, even has a warm tingle to it when you first put it on.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s beautiful and I would HIGHLY recommend it.</li>
            <li>Very very good - makes my skin feel soft,</li>
            <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very fair, sensitive combination skin and was looking for a charcoal mask that would suck out all the gunk.</li>
            <li>Love love love.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this mask twice and have fallen in love with it.</li>
            <li>As others have written, this is more of a scrub than a mask - except they want you to leave it on 5 minutes and then massage into your face for another 1-2.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I would classify this more like a &amp;#34;scrub&amp;#34; than a &amp;#34;mask&amp;#34; because of its grainy consistency.  </li>
            <li>I think there might be a better charcoal mask out there.</li>
            <li>so don&#x27;t hesitate; this item is fantastic!</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be buying more.</li>

            <li>Lovely and refreshing.</li>
            <li>I love Freeman&#x27;s products-</li>
            <li>Although I do like this product, I think it&#x27;s better to be categorized as an exfoliator.</li>

            <li>I love this polish mask.</li>
            <li>Love it</li>

            <li>truly love this product.</li>
            <li>think I have found the best combination of facial cleanser and makeup for my skin.</li>
            <li>The clearest, smoothest, and most even-toned skin I have had in years.</li>
            <li>In fact, I think this product would be better dubbed as solely an exfoliator.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this mask.</li>
            <li>and I love the warming effect it gave me.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quite abrasive, so I suggest not to use it more than twice a week.</li>
            <li>ive used it 2x and it made my extremely smooth!</li>
            <li>Also one of my favorites :)</li>
            <li>My scars seemed to vanish, and my skin looked better than it has in YEARS.</li>
            <li>My skin is still clearer and in much better condition than it was before, so I&#x27;m still in love with this mask.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s more of a scrub than a mask, i wish the texture was creamier.</li>
            <li>and I will be buying more</li>
            <li>Overall, I am so impressed.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this mask.</li>

            <li>This mask pulled everything out and after about 2 weeks my skin looked and felt so much better.</li>
            <li>Though I think it could have been better packaged.  </li>
            <li>I love this scrub.</li>
            <li>Love the way it feels.</li>
            <li>(It&#x27;s more of an exfoliator</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I love the value of the Freeman masks and facials.  </li>
            <li>Absolutely love this scrub.</li>
            <li>This is a sugar-based product (glad it&#x27;s not those plastic micro beads though).</li>
            <li>It seems to be more of a scrub than a mask.  </li>
            <li>I gave this product five star, because it does what it says and more.</li>
            <li>more like a sugar scrub then a face mask..</li>
            <li>I love this mask, made my skin feel like a baby&#x27;s butt.</li>
            <li>I love this scrub.  </li>
            <li>My face feels and appears smoother than it has in many years.</li>
            <li>I was satisfied with the product but</li>
            <li>Really, it cleans well and does a great job of cleaning oily skin.</li>
            <li>Talk about refreshing</li>
            <li>and sometimes I use more to get my decolletage.</li>
            <li>I love all Freeman masks and this one is one of their best.&lt;br /&gt;Not</li>
            <li>tested on animals either :)</li>
            <li>love that it has charcoal in it too.</li>
            <li>Face feels so smooth afterwards !</li>
            <li>:)&lt;br /&gt;Anyhow</li>
            <li>My face is softer, my complexion is clearing up and skin tone is more even.</li>
            <li>I also love that the scrub is made from sugar</li>
            <li>I have an oily face (hence trying this product) and was paranoid that this mask was going to just make my face even more oily.</li>
            <li>I SIMPLY LOVE THIS MASK.EVERY MORNING</li>
            <li>DID I SAY I LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS MASK.</li>
            <li>my skin tone looks more even after using it.</li>
            <li>I love all freeman products.</li>
            <li>This one is my favorite.</li>
            <li>Product is more of a scrub not a mask.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ll buy more once I run</li>
            <li>Both my nephew and I love it.</li>
            <li>but most people don&#x27;t recommend sugar scrubs on your face</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Love this scrub/mask.</li>
            <li>I love the warming sensation when u rub the scrub on your skin</li>
            <li>Makes my face nice and smooth.</li>
            <li>Baking soda is a better exfoliator, anyway.</li>
            <li>Finding this product was an interesting experience.</li>
            <li>I love the way this makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li>My scars seemed to vanish, and my skin looked better than it has in YEARS.</li>
            <li>My skin is still clearer and in much better condition than it was before, so I&#x27;m still in love with this mask.</li>
            <li>Seems to be comprised mostly of granulated sugar.</li>
            <li>, you feel the charcoal more  on your face, then when I don&#x27;t fell it any more</li>
            <li>the consistency is more scrub like</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used most of Freeman&#x27;s masks and scrubs</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>Its more like an exfoliated goop you sort of pat onto your skin --</li>
            <li>Happy with this product,  shipping was fast also.</li>
            <li>and i love it.</li>
            <li>Right when you put it on its nice and warm.</li>
            <li>It heats up and draws out impurities -- in fact, the mask heats up FAST and gets very warm.  </li>
            <li>This is a very unique mask.</li>
            <li>I ordered it 3 days ago and it arrived a week early which is good!</li>
            <li>It also has a really nice unique warming effect.  </li>
            <li>You also get more for your money and it has a nice, sweet scent.</li>
            <li>Okay, I read a lot of really good reviews and was super excited to try this out for myself.  </li>
            <li>I think this is overpriced, but it is pretty good.</li>
            <li>it is pretty good ...</li>
            <li>I first bought this in the packet size because I had heard good things about using products with activated charcoal for oily, acne-prone skin (like mine).</li>
            <li>Surprising warmth at first....</li>
            <li>it ok for a scrub, but nothing special in my opinion!</li>
            <li>make sure you leave on your face the full amount of time it says!  </li>
            <li>it wont cleanse your pores very well but it can make your skin super smooth and glowing i highy reccommend this to everyone and plus its cheap which is awesome</li>
            <li>Once she found out how much she liked it she begged me to buy her a tube of her own.</li>
            <li>Your skin does feel really amazing after use, but do use a old wash cloth for the charcoal does stain good ones.</li>
            <li>This mask is awesome and left my skin beautifully smooth.  </li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this mask after hearing so many good things about it.</li>
            <li>I love the feel of  this, it&#x27;s best to wet your face then put this on</li>
            <li>Feels great, makes my skin really soft!</li>
            <li>Makes me feel so clean!</li>
            <li>Face feels really clean!</li>
            <li>Love this stuff, though the lid doesn&#x27;t clasp shut (which made it leak when being shipped to me) but other than that it cleans my face wonderfully</li>
            <li>Very high moisture, good price, good qualities, helps my skin so much smoother like a baby&#x27;s skin.</li>
            <li>Great value and leaves my skin soft.</li>
            <li>Great price-might compare to Lush&#x27;s &amp;#34;Dark Angels&amp;#34; charcoal scrub.</li>
            <li>It does a great job of cleaning my pores and smoothing my 56 year old skin.  </li>
            <li>love this-makes your skin so smooth</li>
            <li>but even after just one time my skin was so smooth and soft.i love this stuff</li>
            <li>The smell is a very calming sweet and it feels great on my skin.</li>
            <li>great product, my skin never felt so soft.</li>
            <li>Good gentle scrub for face.</li>
            <li>Reasonable price for good product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m buying one to send to my baby sister as a gift I loved it so much</li>
            <li>This stuff makes my face feel very smooth and clean from any dirt and oil.</li>
            <li>I repurchased the mini packet three or so times before I decided that I just need the full size one!</li>
            <li>So I first I love love love the smell of this product so yummy .</li>
            <li>The texture of the scrub is easily put on this way.</li>
            <li>Nothing permanent, but take it easy until you know what your skin will tolerate.&lt;br</li>
            <li>great facial for healthy glowing face.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s decent as a scrub but the charcoal doesn&#x27;t draw impurities out of pores like a good clay mask does.  </li>
            <li>While it was &amp;#34;fun&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;exciting&amp;#34; for me to try something new, I guess I just thought it worked great and decided to buy a full size.  </li>
            <li>my face looks good and feels soft!!</li>
            <li>, it was the Freeman Feeling Beautiful Clay Purifying Facial Mask, with 5/5 stars</li>
            <li>When first applied, there is a warming sensation, not to warm though.</li>
            <li>so I haven&#x27;t tried it more than once, but I am purchasing it on here now since I can&#x27;t find the full tube anywhere.</li>
            <li>It smells pretty nice...</li>
            <li>so I haven&#x27;t tried it more than once, but I am purchasing it on here now since I can&#x27;t find the full tube anywhere.</li>
            <li>I love how this leaves my face feeling smooth and clean.  </li>
            <li>It smells great and leaves my skin super soft!</li>
            <li>Amazon does a really good job of alerting me to new products.</li>
            <li>I typically have reactions to masks, this one was perfect and non-drying.  </li>
            <li>The scrub works just fine.</li>
            <li>It opens and closes perfectly fine.</li>
            <li>I have tried so many difference face wash brands and types for my super combination skin.</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;ll break out into huge hives for weeks).</li>
            <li>I use this as a spot treatment, and legit, is the best all natural, or closest to all natural, thing i have used for spot treating blemishes.</li>
            <li>Skin feels smooth and renew</li>
            <li>It leaves your face smooth.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t expect it to go on smooth like a clay mask</li>
            <li>My face feels so smooth afterward.  </li>
            <li>I really liked to use this as a scrub, I didn&#x27;t seem much benefit from trying to use it as a mask.</li>
            <li>I even have the renewal advanced cleansing system with the brush..</li>
            <li>Kind of intense.  </li>
            <li>My face and neck are smooth.</li>
            <li>Fantastic.</li>
            <li>Then I rinsed it off with warm water while making circular motions to really exfoliate my face and OH MYGOODNESS.</li>
            <li>my face was really smooth.</li>
            <li>And the skin feels smooth to the touch.</li>
            <li>Anyway, I tried this product and my face feels great after only one use.</li>
            <li>It makes it feel so smooth and</li>
            <li>silky smooth</li>
            <li>- maybe dab it lightly with a towel before applying the mask.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The scrub is gentle, my skin felt amazing</li>
            <li>and so that was important to me</li>
            <li>but I didint want to sacrifice smooth skin lol.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>have light acne around my eyebrows, temples and jawline.</li>

            <li>very soft&lt;br /&gt;- smells nice</li>
            <li>The sugar in it is a great scrub and it actually works.</li>
            <li>effective and fast.</li>
            <li>My skin is as smooth as it is after a microderm for a fraction of the cost.</li>
            <li>Cheap.</li>
            <li>I read the reviews of this mask and since it&#x27;s so cheap</li>
            <li>This stuff is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>One said this was available at CVS</li>
            <li>Geez, this stuff was cheap; two for $7.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin so smooth.</li>

            <li>It leaves my skin really soft and it&#x27;s a good exofoliater before you put on your makeup.</li>
            <li>You can leave it on your skin for a good five to seven minutes and achieve what it claims -- clear, purified and exfoliated skin.</li>
            <li>I am sure with the right magnification you could see the damage you are doing.</li>
            <li>I would highly suggest this to anyone just make sure to use a moisturizer after!</li>
            <li>Awesome alternative to LUSH&#x27;s Dark Angels cleanser although to be honest</li>
            <li>It makes my skin feel smooth and fresh!</li>
            <li>I really love this mask, the smell is amazing and leaves my skin super soft.</li>
            <li>Afterwards my face did feel really smooth and clean.</li>
            <li>I use it once a week to exfoliate and it leave my skin smooth and clean.</li>
            <li>every time after using it skin become so clean and smooth.</li>
            <li>I am a firm believer that you need to take care of your skin every day for it to be healthy and beautiful.</li>
            <li>Firstly, it smells incredible; and finally, because, it smells</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone, it&#x27;s my new favorite mask!</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, the results are so amazing that I would still highly recommend this product, and I intend to keep using and buying it for myself.</li>
            <li>Well worth the small price, it&#x27;s effective, smells great and its so easy to use.</li>
            <li>I used it last night and my skin feels AMAZING!</li>
            <li>I love this stuff soooo much!</li>
            <li>disclosure: i have a pretty even skin complexion, but just wanted something to make my skin look more refreshed and glow.</li>
            <li>I was excited to get it.</li>
            <li>A very good sugar scrub and very gentle as long as you don&#x27;t over scrub.  </li>
            <li>I use this product and my skin felt so clean and fresh!</li>
            <li>But this mask/scrub threw me for a loop because it gave me a very significant result with the first use.</li>
            <li>Face feels clean after.</li>
            <li>I immediately felt like my face was clean and it made my face feel super smooth, too.  </li>
            <li>And I use it on my legs in combo with shaving to keep my skin super smooth.</li>
            <li>It made his skin super smooth and matte.</li>
            <li>I love this scrub, it does a great job of polishing away all the dead skin cells.</li>
            <li>It has a nice but light scent, and I say this as someone highly sensitive to smell, it doesn&#x27;t trigger my allergies or headaches at all.</li>
            <li>This is by far the best facial scrub I have tried!</li>
            <li>If it doesn&#x27;t, I&#x27;ll rinse it and clean it so it does.</li>
            <li>My face feels super smooth afterward.</li>
            <li>Its a grain similar to Tree Hut body scrubs (a bit grittier than a fine grain like most face washes), no odd odors, taste like sugar (obviously lol)</li>
            <li>have used other Freeman products, but this is absolutely the best.</li>
            <li>I certainly think it&#x27;s one of the better ones.&lt;br /&gt;People</li>
            <li>- don&#x27;t worry you&#x27;re doing it right!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s amazing makes my face feel so soft and clean</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had my fair share of using facial washes.</li>
            <li>The sugar makes it smell sweet</li>
            <li>This is cool.</li>
            <li>but it was a sweet scent.</li>
            <li>You can read my full review at BeautyApocalypse dot com.</li>
            <li>effect when you put this mask on your face and it is actually true.</li>
            <li>Leaving smooth and fresh skin.</li>
            <li>Once I scrubbed it off it did leave my skin nice and soft.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference in the oil levels of my skin, but everything else about this product description rings true.</li>
            <li>The real reward is the exfoliation after leaving it on 5-7 minutes, that&#x27;s when the magic happens.</li>
            <li>I used this scrub before reading the directions and found it to be just okay, but when I followed the instructions I could really tell the difference.</li>
            <li>Your skin feels...open...and cool....</li>
            <li>is that you dont need to leave it on forever like the clay masks to get the full effect.</li>
            <li>This scrub was ok, but I don&#x27;t feel it really did anything for my pores or texture of my skin.</li>
            <li>Love the intense scrub it produces.</li>
            <li>What cool about this product</li>
            <li>Heard that this was a good spa like deep cleanser.</li>
            <li>Some are saying it&#x27;s just a scrub and not a mask, and given the consistency, I can see why, but to get the full effect you need to use it as a mask.</li>
            <li>perfect.&lt;br /&gt;I licked it off my lips couple times, it&#x27;s so sweet</li>
            <li>Better luck purchasing a straight charcoal product and exfoliating with baking soda/powder.</li>
            <li>so much i will order more when needed</li>
            <li>I have to say the scrub have helped clean most of those stubbing build up on my faces making me look a bit more younger.</li>
            <li>and i feel fresh and clean after.</li>
            <li>Leaves your face feeling fresh &amp; clean.</li>
            <li>My skin feels and looks fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>Seller quick and undamaged.</li>
            <li>this mask in particular, I have seen many reviews that say it is not a mask, just a scrub.</li>
            <li>Quick delivery.</li>
            <li>but it goes away quickly.</li>
            <li>i enjoyed using the oatmeal and avocado mask also, i&#x27;ll definitely be trying more freeman products.</li>
            <li>I opened the package and saw they had taped the lid closed to make sure that it came nice and sealed and not squeezed into the mailing envelope.</li>
            <li>It turned out to be one of the best facial products I&#x27;ve purchased in awhile, especially in terms of value.</li>
            <li>It does a great job of &amp;#34;polishing&amp;#34; off the dead skin cells; my skin felt so smooth after I used it.</li>
            <li>to possibly describe how wonderful this facial scrub/mask is.</li>
            <li>It is a quick way to pamper yourself any time you want.</li>
            <li>Most face scrubs are very, very tough on the face, but this one is perfect.</li>
            <li>The texture just isn&#x27;t really right to be used as a mask, but it makes a good facial AND body scrub to be used in the shower.  </li>
            <li>I have a pineapple sugar scrup which is OK and the dead sea mineral clay mask which I love but the best thing about this black sugar mask</li>
            <li>It may feel kind of intense and rough but its amazing afterward.</li>
            <li>I have to stress how important it is to follow the instructions exactly....</li>
            <li>My first use of this product my skin was evenly smooth</li>
            <li>First I dampen my face to help the mask smooth on and stick during application</li>
            <li>But in the meantime if I use this product in the shower, very (very!)</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t leave a &amp;#34;squeaky clean&amp;#34; feeling, more of a natural clean if that makes sense.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This goes onto my list of Top 5 favorite scents along with pool-side chlorine scent, fresh green tea, snuggle, dinner, black sugar polish mask. :D</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin so soft and smooth and it feels so clean!</li>
            <li>My new favorite face mask.</li>
            <li>I have oily acne prone skin with lots of scarring and find that this product is great at making my skin feel less of an oil spill and smoother.  </li>
            <li>Not my favorite Freeman product by far, but not bad.</li>
            <li>My neck looked nice and my hands are soft and pretty.</li>
            <li>and after awhile when you get to the rinse stage it comes of really easy and leaves your skin SUPER smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>Hands down one of the best things I have come across as far as skin care</li>
            <li>Love the heat activation, wish I could find it in stores near me!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Now, my funny story!</li>
            <li>That only makes accidental swallowing while using in the shower better!</li>
            <li>Just very smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>Works great, can actually see it pull the gunk out of pores which is gross but great in the long run.</li>
            <li>My skin is silky soft and very smooth.  </li>
            <li>you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ironic thing in all of this is that after using it my kind looks so clear!</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend the black sugar and charcoal scrub to anyone looking to take better care of their skin.&lt;br /&gt;The warming sensation is a nice surprise as it feels nice.</li>
            <li>it works best if you really take your time and gently work it into your pores with a little bit of water for about two minutes.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great exfoliator, without being harsh.</li>
            <li>Enjoy freeman mask so much.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s very shiny on your face and the sugar needs to get worked out to a smooth layer too.</li>
            <li>I rarely get pimples and it has helped reduce the number of blackheads on my nose and cheeks.</li>
            <li>I bought this at cvs once and liked it, this was the same one.</li>
            <li>and I rarely ever do reviews but felt compelled to write one for this.</li>
            <li>It felt like I had just sloughed off years worth of dirt and debris that had built up over 23 years.</li>
            <li>even their own facial cleansers didn&#x27;t take off my makeup like this product does.</li>
            <li>I got this to substitute my love for Lush&#x27;s charcoal sugar scrub, since that is pricier.</li>
            <li>The price for this was excellent and not quite as messy as Lush&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>This is a pretty sweet product.</li>
            <li>The warming sensation when you apply it is nice (especially in the winter!), and the scrub is not too abrasive.  </li>
            <li>, it leaved the skin nicely exfoliated and soft, ready for the serum and moisturizer (the mask itself moisturizes</li>
            <li>This stuff makes my face so soft, I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>The charcoal pulls the dirt out of your pores and leaves your skin fresh and exfoliated.</li>
            <li>I use this in the shower because its nice to get a big glob and work it on to your face.</li>
            <li>This product made my sensitive skin break out even more.</li>
            <li>Okay, so I have relatively sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I logged into Amazon I got a nice display of eczema products and this product which left me scratching my head.</li>
            <li>i give it 5 stars well worth the money.</li>
            <li>But I love the clear skin.</li>
            <li>This is much more cost efficient and works better than any other exfoliation product I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>A scrub that I can feel work, it goes on smooth and rinses off leaving my face feeling clean and clear.</li>
            <li>Leaves you feeling very clean and soft.</li>
            <li>If youcut yourself, nothing you put on it will heal it right away.</li>
            <li>This face mask gives you sensation of heat right after apply , it works as soon as you put it on...</li>
            <li>wonders cleared my forehead acne right up</li>
            <li>You can see and feel the difference right away.</li>
            <li>I saw a difference right away.</li>
            <li>Iam a female welder and it cleans my face so good and leaves my skin so soft!!</li>
            <li>My face felt so soft and fresh after!!</li>
            <li>The sugar crystals work very well and your skin feels so clean.</li>
            <li>I was surprised at first because it seems more like a scrub, but I applied it like a mask, let it sit for about 10 minutes then used it as a scrub.</li>
            <li>It leave my face super soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>It cleans my pores better than most scrubs and makes them appear less noticeable.  </li>
            <li>After the first use my face looked like a playdough fun factory.</li>
            <li>and the thing is it is such an amazing product for such a cheap price!</li>
            <li>not 100% sold until I woke up in the morning and washed my face with my normal moisturizing wash, my face was a smooth as baby&#x27;s skin.</li>
            <li>Amazing product gets rid of dry winter skin in one use.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After the mask my face felt squeaky clean and super soft.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t know how wonderful it would feel, that it actually warms for a few seconds after you apply.</li>
            <li>It’s really not the most comfortable mask to have on one’s face.  </li>
            <li>it warms up quickly and i really like that aspect of the mask</li>
            <li>Mainly it is my nose area that feels squeaky clean.</li>
            <li>It has a nice warming quality and it is grainy enough that I can really feel it doing it&#x27;s job when I scrub it off.</li>
            <li>This one scrubs away dead skin cells and leaves a pleasant herbal fragrance.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t typically write a review but after one use of this product I loved it so much I had to!  </li>
            <li>Not only does is give my face a very clean fresh feel, but it also removes alot of dirt and oils.</li>
            <li>I use other Freeman products that I enjoy much more.</li>
            <li>I have other masks that I enjoy more than this one but still like the end results after.</li>
            <li>I was completely misguided by other review saying this was great.</li>
            <li>If you like heavy floral-ish scents, this will be great for you, but personally I was put off by the strong perfume.</li>
            <li>But it definitely felt/looked really clean, oil free and</li>
            <li>It does live you with an amazing clean smooth skin, I usually use it once a week and let it sit for about 15 mins then rinse off</li>
            <li>i love this stuff it leaves my face feeling and looking  nice and clear  plus its doesnt smells harsh ..</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s pretty transparent.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t experience the same overwhelming results that others are describing.</li>
            <li>you first pad it on, let it sit, then massage it around your face and rinse</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t feel any particular sensation after leaving it on for the recommended time, but once scrubbed off, my skin DOES feel super smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li>Can see a difference after first use</li>
            <li>I follow the instructions exactly</li>
            <li>Leaves my skin soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>My skin is left looking healthy and refreshed.</li>
            <li>so I was interested in trying it out.</li>
            <li>When you first use it, you will understand why it seems that way.</li>
            <li>I have not had flakes since the day I first started using this product, about 2 months ago.</li>
            <li>I think the face is the first thing you have to take care</li>
            <li>but with this is like Gods gift not expensive</li>
            <li>Learn from my mistake ;)</li>
            <li>I have used many different apricot scrubs in the past, but I&#x27;m really glad I switched to this sugar scrub; it works so much better; doesn&#x27;t leave my face feeling like it&#x27;s been through the blender.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!!</li>
            <li>Every evening I apply Neutrogena Oil Free Acne Stress Control Triple Action Toner.  </li>
            <li>I plan on buying this charcoal again, most definitely!</li>
            <li>I absolutely adore this product!</li>
            <li>It is rather abrasive and daily use would mostly like irritate your skin</li>
            <li>I decided to try this product after seeing my face for the first time in about 1 1/2 yrs.</li>
            <li>My pores are larger than I thought, more discoloration.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s definitely made my skin smoother and more even toned.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s kind of crazy how it dries the acne but adds such great moisture (without an oily feeling)!</li>
            <li>I really like it!</li>
            <li>i really like this mask!</li>
            <li>I have been using Freeman facial masks for many years.</li>
            <li>The first time I used this mask, I could feel the difference in my skin.</li>
            <li>Soft and smooth skin resulted from weekly use of this product.</li>
            <li>You could just use sugar and lemon and get a better facial scrub.</li>
            <li>I do so love this mask, wish I could find this locally</li>
            <li>This mask and scrub has never failed me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After I used the product my complexion is smooth and clear.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say I love this product enough!</li>
            <li>Evidently, that was my mistake.</li>
            <li>Buy it and you won&#x27;t be sorry, it&#x27;s the best!!</li>
            <li>First, I didn&#x27;t purchase this through Amazon.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin feel so smooth and look so clear and glowing after I use.</li>
            <li>as you scrub it on your face, and when you wash it off: Ahh, I feel smooth and soft like a goddess and no residue, no redness, dryness, or &amp;#34;tight&amp;#34; feeling.</li>
            <li>When first applied, it feels like smearing honey on my face.</li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s not only a mask but a scrub for when you wash it off.</li>
            <li>When I first splash water onto my face to start scrubbing I feel a soothing warmth coming off the mask.</li>
            <li>but before I did, I went onto their website and decided to try the travel-sized packet first.</li>
            <li>I thought the mask did exactly as it claims to do: to rid your face of oil and impurities.</li>
            <li>THE FIRST THING I DO IS APPLY</li>
            <li>It feels soothing and not uncomfortable.</li>
            <li>you can see the results from the first use</li>
            <li>Cleans pretty well but leaves face a but oily.</li>
            <li>first time I ever bought a face mask</li>
            <li>Its good , keeps away the whit heads and isn&#x27;t too harsh on my face and neck.</li>
            <li>Its not chemically painful or super strong, and does a very good job with skin polishing and detox.</li>
            <li>Okay, so I&#x27;ve tried 3 different freeman masks over the last few months (Clay Mask, Charcoal and black sugar, &amp; Dead sea minerals) just to see which one I like best, and though I don&#x27;t think this one is the best I&#x27;ve used</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not doing to repurchase because I&#x27;ve still got half a bottle, and I&#x27;m still hoping to find that right kind of charcoal/sugar mask combination.</li>
            <li>I then scrub it a bit harder-my skin isn&#x27;t sensitive-and rinse whilst still scrubbing with decently warm (not hot) water.</li>
            <li>Anyway, the reason this mask is getting five stars from me is because holy cow is it an amazing exfoliator.</li>
            <li>and it leaves me skin so soft and clean.</li>
            <li>Just clean and soft.</li>
            <li>I like how this makes my skin feel soft and clean.</li>
            <li>Skin feel so soft and clean afterwards.  </li>
            <li>leaves my face feeling so soft and clean.</li>
            <li>And as far as the cap issue goes, I keep mine clean.</li>
            <li>I usually cannot tell the difference after the first use of the product but immediately I loved how my face looked and felt .</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m rarely wowed by a beauty product, but I highly recommend this one.</li>
            <li>Most masks, your face is supposed to feel clean and tight.</li>
            <li>I have made this brand part of my skin routine because it leaves positive results.</li>
            <li>Having had such wonderful success with SkinFoods Black Sugar Foaming Scrub, I wanted to find some of the same elements plus charcoal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty gentle and doesn&#x27;t strip my skin.</li>
            <li>This product might be worth trying, but I think something with alpha hydroxy acid or some other type of acid exfoliator might produce better results for you.</li>
            <li>I used to get this product from those small packets in Wal-mart but decided I liked it so much I needed to save money and buy the full product.</li>
            <li>only thing I can add is that I also apply a light moisturizer to my face after bathing and I am looking so much better and younger.ter and younger.</li>
            <li>I use it once a week as part of my exfoliation routine and everytime my skin feels so soft and clean and very polished.</li>
            <li>It works well, I just wish the charcoal had a little bit more stick!</li>
            <li>The first time I used this my skin automatically went from oily and shiny to matte and normal!</li>
            <li>Leaves skin feeling new, looks shiny, and fresh.</li>
            <li>I think this would be better suited for dry skin types.</li>
            <li>I also have previously used Freeman masks and liked them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It leaves my face feeling super soft and I like the smell.</li>
            <li>mask leaves my face super soft.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe my face feels this clean, it definitely gives my hope for better skin in the future.</li>
            <li>When rinsed off my skin is super soft and I use it in conjunction with another product I like to control shine for hours.&lt;br</li>
            <li>After I got home from the gym I would wipe my face with a baby wipe, dampen my face with warm water, and put a generous amount of the Charcoal and Black Sugar Mask all over my face.</li>
            <li>and I love that it doesn&#x27;t strip my face dry.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t believe how soft my skin felt, and how quickly it removed blackheads.</li>
            <li>I would have preferred it to smell warm and sugary, like you&#x27;d expect, instead of slightly floral.     </li>
            <li>I am in my late thirties and although I&#x27;ve always had decent skin, I&#x27;ve noticed that as I age I seem to get more and more blackheads and clogged pores.</li>
            <li>Gone are the dry top layers.</li>
            <li>This is a 2 part mask and it leaves your skin super soft and supple.</li>
            <li>I am very particular and fussy when it comes to beauty products, but this made it to my keeper list.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This is gentle and smells sweet, pulls out impurities and leaves skin soft, supple, and without redness.</li>
            <li>Pure and natural!&lt;br /&gt;Maybe tasty.</li>
            <li>And even though I&#x27;m sure there isn&#x27;t really anyone out there who&#x27;d leave it on for this long, PLEASE DON&#x27;T DO THIS!</li>
            <li>And even though I&#x27;m sure there isn&#x27;t really anyone out there who&#x27;d leave it on for this long, PLEASE DON&#x27;T DO THIS!</li>
            <li>I love this scrub, I it scours off dry spots while still being gentle and I feel as if the charcoal purifies pores&lt;</li>
            <li>ONLY good thing I can say about this stuff is that it didn&#x27;t dry out my skin</li>
            <li>Over the next two months I went to Walmart on a weekly basis only to get more!</li>
            <li>It has a really good smell, it&#x27;s kinda hard to explain</li>
            <li>Like I couldn&#x27;t stop touching my face, it was so soft but at the same time it felt clean and the good part is that it doesn&#x27;t feel all dry and tight and</li>
            <li>Other than that, it makes my face super smooth.</li>
            <li>Makes my skin feel clean and soft and like new.</li>
            <li>This cleanses really nice, but very abrasive on skin, and it goes on patchy  not smooth for a mask.  </li>
            <li>but I leave it on for about 10 minutes and gentle scrub for 2 and my face feel baby soft and fresh.</li>
            <li>This works really well as an exfoliant and always leaves my skin feeling soft and fresh.</li>
            <li>I love the rough granules in it which makes it really feel like you&#x27;re sandblasting your face.  </li>
            <li>Much gentler on skin.  </li>
            <li>Now my whole forehead is peeling.  </li>
            <li>well, not so much now.</li>
            <li>This is my absolute go to face mask/scrub whenever my pores are a tad too noticeable.</li>
            <li>The charcoal benefit works very well and the sugar scrub is an added bonus as a two-in-one product.  </li>
            <li>but I wouldn&#x27;t really call it a mask.</li>
            <li>Could there really be a product</li>
            <li>It really does help with clearing out impurities.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>And the prices is beyond reasonable.</li>
            <li>I have very shiny, oily skin (but no acne)</li>
            <li>I only happened to glance at this product on the shelf at my local grocery store, and it was such a great price that I thought, &amp;#34;Why not?&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really really picky with my face</li>
            <li>and it really works</li>
            <li>But I have never tried something that changed my skin so much after one use.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s sticky and just really wasn&#x27;t what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>I have tried everything, nothing has ever made much of a difference besides fry or burn out my skin.</li>
            <li>i have very oily skin</li>
            <li>It works very well.</li>
            <li>(so that may or may not happen).&lt;br /&gt;It makes my skin so much smoother and softer each time I use it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d have appreciated knowing ahead of time.</li>
            <li>and I probably won&#x27;t continue to use it much except maybe to exfoliate in the shower once in a while.&lt;br /&gt;In case</li>
            <li>(I don&#x27;t have much of an oil problem, I break out after vigorous workouts and when I get my period)</li>
            <li>I have REALLY oily skin and a lot of blackheads on my nose</li>
            <li>I have very oily skin</li>
            <li>The warming sensation is gentle and you can feel it working.</li>
            <li>I actually have used it on my feet, made the heels feel wonderfully smooth.</li>
            <li>It has really helped me with my blackhead problems that are caused by using self tanners.</li>
            <li>highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>I also used it on my brother and his skin is very oily.</li>
            <li>It is a real money saver, if you want a scrub and detox for the price of one.</li>
            <li>Went through a whole tube before I paid attention to the directions to use it as a mask.</li>
            <li>I do recommend this for anyone with really oily skin like mine.</li>
            <li>While I was rinsing it out I could instantly feel how smooth my skin was.</li>
            <li>I really recommend this mask.</li>
            <li>At 36, I had very noticeable pores.</li>
            <li>With this, I can&#x27;t tell much of a difference.</li>
            <li>I decided to try this verision out because I really like scrubs.</li>
            <li>i want to eat it off my face it really works</li>
            <li>I then sit and watch some TV - the whole time massaging it into my skin.</li>
            <li>You really cannot beat it.</li>
            <li>My face was a lovely shade of pink when finished, and I was amazed at how well this sticky material washed off my face.  </li>
            <li>Gentle scrub.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t really pull the oil from my skin, but does exfoliate well and make my face feel like a baby&#x27;s butt.</li>
            <li>And really you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li>I am 47 and my skin gets very congested around my chin.</li>
            <li>Fantastic facial mask.</li>
            <li>I was very nervous to try this product because I have acne prone combination skin, so a lot of brands can be iffy and cause me to break out.</li>
            <li>After, I gently rub the oil in, ALWAYS in an upward massage.</li>
            <li>Since doing so, I have stopped getting any &amp;#34;monthly&amp;#34; acne, the texture of my face has become even, and while the lines aren&#x27;t gone they do appear much softer.</li>
            <li>Sugar scrubs are gentler on the skin than microbeads too, so I really like it for that reason.</li>
            <li>But a gentle massage is</li>
            <li>I really like it.  </li>
            <li>this did not help me much with exfoliation and did not make my skin clearer.</li>
            <li>and the fact that real sugar was used.</li>
            <li>The smell of this product is very therapeutic to me.</li>
            <li>Charcoal really pulls out the impurities in the skin and</li>
            <li>I will continue to use on a weekly basis and see if I notice real change after a couple of months.</li>
            <li>The sugar is a bit much for me.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it &amp;#34;purged&amp;#34; my skin as much as caused a reaction.</li>
            <li>It came much quicker than I was expecting.</li>
            <li>but when I saw a larger bottle was available</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really feel a difference.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t out much $</li>
            <li>Works very well on my face.</li>
            <li>mask isn&#x27;t really a mask.</li>
            <li>gently scrubbing and ignoring the smell</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m slightly sensitive and while I enjoyed the heat, I also didn&#x27;t want to overdo it and let it sit for only 7 minutes before moving on to the scrubbing in part --</li>
            <li>I would&#x27;ve rated it 5 stars but saw the same product at a drug store today for the same product but 2-1 deal which kind of bummed me out.</li>
            <li>However, Lush&#x27;s left my skin looking better.</li>
            <li>This mask is effective because the sugar removes the dead skin on my face with gentle rubs while the oil in it moisturizes.</li>
            <li>kind of thing, but for the price and ease of use, it&#x27;s definitely worth at least a try.</li>
            <li>It keeps my skin very soft and clean, i no longer have breakouts and my skin stays very even and just has a natural glow to it when I&#x27;m not wearing</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure if you were supposed to wash your face before or dampen it, so I just put it straight into my dry face (still not sure to be honest).</li>
            <li>and after your skin is SO SOFT!!!</li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t mean it won&#x27;t do good for your skin.  </li>
            <li>this is the only charcoal scrub/mask that had such a high rating and such great feedback</li>
            <li>but other than that I love it</li>
            <li>Anything with charcoal affects the friendly flora of the facial skin</li>
            <li>Have not been using long enough to really  give it a nice review.</li>
            <li>(since getting the tube) is putting a fair amount in one palm, a glob just larger than a silver dollar and a half.</li>
            <li>I used to use a popular apricot scrub and the small granules would get stuck in my pores.</li>
            <li>I was surprised the first time I put this on, it almost felt like putting a heating pad to my face.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It has a nice scent, and feels nice, but it&#x27;s difficult to actually get on the face.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin, so I didn&#x27;t test this product on a test patch of skin first.</li>
            <li>Felt nice but Broke me out :-/. So I stopped.</li>
            <li>If you can, spring water supplies the most benefits, hands down.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a professional esthetician and have used the most expensive, high end versions of this kind of scrub</li>
            <li>spanking brand new!  </li>
            <li>My face was as soft as my hands, and I&#x27;ve never felt such a huge difference in the texture of my skin with just one use of something.</li>
            <li>It was easy to apply with the fan brush, I just squeezed out some on the brush, then carefully applied it to a section my face at a time.  </li>
            <li>:  I recommend applying some sort of light, oil-free moisturizer to ensure that your face doesn&#x27;t get too dry and then flake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;the consistency is odd, as most would expect a mask to be thick/gunky but it truly gets the job done.</li>
            <li>then lightly coat with monoi tiare oil and let in sit as I dry off.  </li>
            <li>I have very oily, acne prone skin that really responds well to exfoliation,  but if you have sensitive skin, this might be too &amp;#34;scrubby&amp;#34; for you.</li>
            <li>If you can get a decent coat of it on your face</li>
            <li>the directions don&#x27;t mention to wash your face first but it only makes sense to do that first..</li>
            <li>If you have very sensitive skin, you may find this a bit too much for your skin to handle.</li>
            <li>I ordered three Freeman facial masks at the same time and when they arrived, this one was my least favorite, but now that I&#x27;ve learned how to use it, I LOVE it!  </li>
            <li>Use it after a long day before going to bed , never disappointed me.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have high expectations for this at all.</li>
            <li>, I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this to everyone.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this mask.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>This is the only mask I&#x27;ve tried that made a visible change after the first use!</li>
            <li>But its kind of hard to spread it evenly though.</li>
            <li>While I didn&#x27;t necessarily see an improvement in blackhead reduction, it makes my face super soft!</li>
            <li>Better than my other $60 mask!!</li>
            <li>I have VERY oily and sensitive skin, and have tried just about everything from scrubs, peels, masks, wipes, and prescriptions.</li>
            <li>it goes on like smooth wet sugar .</li>
            <li>it can&#x27;t stay on long, at least from what I&#x27;ve experienced.</li>
            <li>I leave the mask on for about 7 minutes and scrub away, and afterwards my skin feels sooooo soft and my pores feel like they can breathe again, haha.</li>
            <li>(it was... not a good thing, lol), so I left it on longer.</li>
            <li>Maybe all the harsh products, benzoyl peroxide, proactiv etc were just drying out the top layer of my skin and</li>
            <li>I definitely recommend this product if you want an effective, low cost, low maintenance way of taking care of your skin!</li>
            <li>I love to use everyday after work</li>
            <li>This facial has such a nice smell to it, but I will say if you&#x27;re sensitive to strong perfume like scents then this may not be for you since the smell is strong and a little heavy.</li>
            <li>I put my hands into the water to get a little more and my hands felt so soft it startled me!</li>
            <li>Love it and it seems to have a slight warming effect!</li>
            <li>Never makes my face feel dry just smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li>noticed that my skin was so much more clear and that my pores appeared less noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>last right before I got out.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m currently writing this review right after that,</li>
            <li>When I looked in one of those mirrors with the 2 sides (you know one side is huge the other is kinda normal)</li>
            <li>I have a UV(sun) allergy; while that is it&#x27;s own problem, it causes a lot of other complications with my skin in the long run.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m starting to get tiny fine lines, but @ 42</li>
            <li>You have all the other masks available at the stores can we please have lots of these going out everywhere?</li>
            <li>I had purchased the small sample packet awhile back, and liked it so much, I had to order a bottle.</li>
            <li>Though it kind of &#x27;shifted&#x27; a little, it wasn&#x27;t gooey enough to have drips fall into my lap, or on my clothes etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>A tip that I have is to wet face with pretty warm water to open the pores then dry it</li>
            <li>This mask almost creates new looking skin.</li>
            <li>I decided to try something new and bought this product.</li>
            <li>husband ordered this for me and it appeared to be in new condition.  </li>
            <li>Use twice a week and your skin will be like new..</li>
            <li>This one arrived within a day or so and was well packaged and brand new.  </li>
            <li>Then I VERY lightly scrub in small circles, to let the product start working into my skin.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re looking for something to refresh your skin and clean out your pores, reduce scars, and acne, and a rough scrub</li>
            <li>the black sugar really makes your complexion feel soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not really convinced that the charcoal is truly an &amp;#34;active&amp;#34; ingredient that draws impurities out of the skin, but more that the grainy paste exfoliates the upper layers of the skin.  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and this product does not irritate it.</li>
            <li>My face did feel cleaner, looked brighter, and was very soft.</li>
            <li>Helped clear up my complexion too!</li>
            <li>So, so clear!</li>
            <li>This is pretty graphic, but I have to say..</li>
            <li>My fav so far !</li>
            <li>Leaves your skin so soft!</li>
            <li>This is one of those products that actually made a difference from the first time I used it.</li>
            <li>I followed the directions exactly and left it on for 7 minutes and then scrubbed for two minutes in the bath.</li>
            <li>Wal-mart sells small packets like a sample size so try it and see for your self. :)</li>
            <li>It is a bit different than other masks you may have tried, since it doubles as a scrub, but once you get over the porous like texture, you will love it.</li>
            <li>When you give it any friction whatsoever, it begins to actually feel hot.</li>
            <li>The cost was enough to get me interested.</li>
            <li>Overnight, my skin seemed to change completely!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll use it 2-3 times a week in the shower with an exfoliating brush and my skin feels so soft afterwards!</li>
            <li>From now on I&#x27;ll leave the mask on as directed and do what I was doing before; no more experiments, I&#x27;m concerned about my skin even more.</li>
            <li>From now on I&#x27;ll leave the mask on as directed and do what I was doing before; no more experiments, I&#x27;m concerned about my skin even more.</li>
            <li>Overnight, my skin seemed to change completely!</li>
            <li>then when I started scrubbing I just wet my fingers and scrubbed and rinsed with cool water to close the pores</li>
            <li>I recommend applying over a sink because it&#x27;s easy to drop little chunks of the sugar, though once it&#x27;s on</li>
            <li>Although the oil problem was not as bad as when I used the Anti-Stress Dead sea mask, it was still more than I care to deal with on a regular basis.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve also used this product as a quick scrub in a shower and that works great to exfoliate as well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Blackheads had been hiding away for who knows how long, came sliding right out.</li>
            <li>Giving 4 stars because it goes on kind of weird at first.</li>
            <li>It may cause a breakout after the first 2 weeks (i use it 2x a week), but after a month my skin is definitely cleaner, more clear, and less red.</li>
            <li>Also it leaves my skin with a healthy glow over the course of 24hour and over time reduces the old but very few acne scars I  had.</li>
            <li>It smells naturally sweet without a lot of added chemical scents that some other products may have.</li>
            <li>applied this with a large fan paint brush, the same type of brush</li>
            <li>It really does clean the skin and get the dirt out of the pores without doing any excessive damage.</li>
            <li>For makeup, I use a fingertip sized amount of Almay Clear Complexion makeup (in beige 500) mixed with a drop of Clean &amp; Clear Dual Action salicylic acid Moisturizer and a drop of either Clean &amp; Clear Mattifying Moisturizer or the Neutrogena Shine Control primer (rice protein complex).</li>
            <li>The consistency of this stuff takes a little getting used to, it&#x27;s thinner than a traditional mask and feels more like an exfoliating scrub.</li>
            <li>It was hard to distribute making me use alot more then intended.</li>
            <li>most of them either dry my skin out, cause redness, and flaking/peeling while other did nothing to help.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m seeing everything so clearly, including my face.</li>
            <li>This is not a charcoal mask just to be clear</li>
            <li>and this also help clear up the skin.</li>
            <li>pores look clear and clear .</li>
            <li>You apply the stuff to your face and neck, let it sit, which is when the activated charcoal works to clear your pores, and then after 5-10 minutes you scrub your face with it which exfoliates your face.</li>
            <li>Makes your skin soft</li>
            <li>My skin glows afterwards and is really soft.</li>
            <li>My cheeks are sensitive</li>
            <li>It does leave your skin soft.</li>
            <li>If you have a Walmart near by, they always have sample packets of the Freeman masks for you to try.</li>
            <li>Leaves you soft as a baby&#x27;s...</li>
            <li>Like some have said, though, this mask isn&#x27;t really a &amp;#34;mask.&amp;#34; It says to layer it on your skin and then leave for several minutes before rubbing off.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really think that&#x27;s necessary.</li>
            <li>with my face being red and scaly around my nose and forehead  since using this product haven&#x27;t had much to none  </li>
            <li>Second, I don&#x27;t see much improvement in my clogged pores when I use this.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Skin was soft and silky.</li>
            <li>and you will not believe how soft your skin feels.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t recommend for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I leave this on for ten minutes, then scrub gently as I rinse off.</li>
            <li>Once I rinsed my face I could feel how soft my skin felt.</li>
            <li>once you&#x27;re done your face will feel SO SOFT.</li>
            <li>i have sensitive skin and didn&#x27;t have any adverse effects from using it.</li>
            <li>It took off all of my professional makeup.....</li>
            <li>My skin was so soft.</li>
            <li>I followed the directions completely.</li>
            <li>, but so far I don&#x27;t see any signs of a reaction.</li>
            <li>I have really sensitive skin</li>
            <li>One caveat is using it on sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Let me tell you, I use an exfoliating face wash with the soft scrubs and everything.</li>
            <li>I put it on directly after a shower or a steam to the face.</li>
            <li>Now, just because it doesn&#x27;t do anything for my skin (combination with the early stages of wrinkles trying to form</li>
            <li>think that this mask and scrub will work for any skin type because it is not harsh in any way.</li>
            <li>When you scrub this stuff off your face, you automatically have baby soft skin on your face.</li>
            <li>some going so far as to say 27.</li>
            <li>I pair it with the Charcoal face bar from Lush, and done.</li>
            <li>My skin is so clear and soft</li>
            <li>Makes skin feel so soft.</li>
            <li>If you want to have absolutely incredibly soft skin I recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Makes my face so soft</li>
            <li>Makes skin amazingly soft</li>
            <li>The scale from my eczema was gone, completely gone.</li>
            <li>This facial scub works really well.</li>
            <li>HOLY CANNOLI was my face soft after</li>
            <li>It helps control the oil on my face and leaves it feeling so soft.</li>
            <li>SO SO SO SOFT.</li>
            <li>I have ordered multiple times from this seller and the shipping is ridiculously fast.</li>
            <li>Enough to spread/pat out the mask, but also was okay with a few spots of skin tone peeking through here and there under lighter-coated spots.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t able to make it more than about 45 seconds when trying to gently massage my face - the sugar crystals are too large, sharp,  and painful.</li>
            <li>I mean, like, an hour or two later you still smell like you rolled in a rose bush.</li>
            <li>Smells pretty good, but hard to spread on your face, if you try to smear it on like a regular mask, little chunks of this will fall off all over your counter.</li>
            <li>and my skin stays red for a little while after, but feels clean!</li>
            <li>i just love the crazy clean feeling your skin gets after using this product.  </li>
            <li>Your face will feel a bit dry afterward, but some facial lotion will quickly fix that.</li>
            <li>and it even tastes a little sweet when it gets near your mouth.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Me: 34, occasional breakouts (from what I hear, they are hormonal around my age), oily skin (hey, less wrinkles down the road!), fair</li>
            <li>This mask is a bit messy but I like the warming effect and how clean my skin feels afterwards.</li>
            <li>I have been buying more expensive products and I am glad I happened upon the charcoal and black sugar scrub.</li>
            <li>The only thing I was initially hesitant about was the consistency, which is pretty gooey.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Instead, the granules in the mask are not black sugar, but microscopic plastic balls used to mimic the sugar crystals.</li>
            <li>Since I already use a couple of charcoal based products mainly for the tiny blackheads on my nose, I read the reviews for this.</li>
            <li>so if it gets on your lips, yes it is a little sweet</li>
            <li>My skin looks and feels so clean and is softer and smoother than with any other individual mask, scrub or combination of the two that I&#x27;ve ever</li>
            <li>Highly recommend especially for the price.</li>
            <li>It gently removes all the dead skin cells, leaves my face as smooth as a baby&#x27;s butt, and I swear my pores are three times smaller after using this mask for the last month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>When applying to face it can be a little messy but the warming sensation is such a good feeling.  </li>
            <li>Depending on how much time I have and how clogged my pores feel, I sometimes let it set for as long as 25 minutes.</li>
            <li>Smells FABULOUS, sugary but not overwhelming.</li>
            <li>I have fairly sensitive skin and am not a big fan of physical exfoliants for my face unless they&#x27;re really gentle.</li>
            <li>I then washed it off with cool water, took a shower, and dried off.</li>
            <li>It is kind of annoying to apply because it drips and never fully dries, but I just put a towel over my lap and it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li>I mean I like this not only because of that feature but because its pretty much true of what it afvertised.</li>
            <li>After I try a new face wash, I always perform an effectiveness test by wiping my forehead with a damp paper towel after washing my face to see if any dirt was left over.  </li>
            <li>Normally squeaky clean &#x3D; dry and tight.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle enough to wear every day, multiple times a day, no redness or drying!</li>
            <li>I also have very sensitive skin because I&#x27;m a red head and not once has this product irritated my skin.</li>
            <li>Most face scrubs make the skin extra dry and make your skin feel tight, but this one doesn&#x27;t do that at all.</li>
            <li>I did follow other reviewers instructions to use after taking a hot shower, to get some steam-action working.</li>
            <li>I sat in front of my computer and played a few games while still very aware I had the mask on my face.</li>
            <li>I was interested in trying this as a low-cost alternative to active charcoal masks found in high-end beauty stores, like Sephora.  </li>
            <li>Plays music very clear and loud, fits better than Apple earbuds and not as expensive.</li>
            <li>Really rough, with large crystals.</li>
            <li>but I mainly wanted to write a review to say that the same bottle is only $3.50 at CVS!!</li>
            <li>Probably useful if you have pretty tough skin</li>
            <li>It felt hot on my face, and after using it I feel like my pores looked more dirty than they did before I used the mask.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty difficult to find a smooth, non-bumpy patch of skin on face at the moment.</li>
            <li>Although I am a regular customer of Amazon, why would anyone pay $9.99 when you can buy directly from Freeman Beauty&#x27;s website for $3.99 each?</li>
            <li>Left it on for 10 minutes, scrubbed for 2 minutes and had an ultra soft face.</li>
            <li>I thought I was having a reaction, but apparently this happens every time.</li>
            <li>the formula is not rough on my skin.</li>
            <li>But after 5 miniutes and 2 of scrubing it left my skin exstreamly soft.</li>
            <li>This product not only refreshed my skin but also helped scrub away old acne scars.</li>
            <li>This happens to me after I get a professional facial as all the work draws impurities to the surface.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Because I use the oil religiously, this product has never dried my skin out.</li>
            <li>My skin feels so soft when I use it, and I have to admit that the tiny blackheads I had are gone now.</li>
            <li>My skin feels so soft when I use it, and I have to admit that the tiny blackheads I had are gone now.</li>
            <li>Oh my goodness, especially if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Oh my goodness, especially if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>while at the same time fighting dry flakes in certain areas.</li>
            <li>For a product so inexpensive compared to other, high-end masks, it certainly delivers every bit it promises.</li>
            <li>But it really does shrink your pores, get that dirt out, without dehydrating your skin (btw, big difference between dry skin and dehydrated skin).</li>
            <li>After waiting 7 minutes I massaged the scrub in my face with damp hands for two minutes, rinsed, patted my face dry and then moisturized as normal.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t dry like normal masks</li>
            <li>I use the Freeman Facial Charcoal &amp; Black Sugar every other day and it leaves my skin so clean and clear.  </li>
            <li>and this is gentle enough for my sensitive skin but rough enough to actually work!</li>
            <li>Charcoal face masks have been hyped up a lot on social media</li>
            <li>After I rinsed, I couldn&#x27;t believe that my face was not dry at ALL.</li>
            <li>No blackheads, no whiteheads, no dry skin.</li>
            <li>The smell is nice and the texture was a little weird at first but the results definitely out weigh that.</li>
            <li>The trick is that you need to splash a little water on your face first and then apply and scrub.  </li>
            <li>I first tried this mask from the little sample size they sell at Walmart.  </li>
            <li>I have tried a few different scrubs over the past year, but this is by far my favorite.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s abrasive but gentle and unlike scrubs that used ground nut shells and other coarse ingredients, the sugar will not clog your pores because it melts.</li>
            <li>Makes your skin feel soft for long time but did not work on my pores</li>
            <li>Same with all other Freeman products, much cheaper at your local drug store.</li>
            <li>mask is way different than any other clay type mask, more like a thick, oozy sugar scrub that sits on your face.  </li>
            <li>I read that black sugar works wonders and it really does</li>
            <li>Aside from the slight polishing affect of rubbing the sugar on and off your face, this doesnt really do anything.</li>
            <li>I found out about this line of facial products via social media.</li>
            <li>I have used scrubs in the past that have removed the dead skin from my face for the most part.</li>
            <li>Keep in mind it will not dry or harden like a regular mask, so</li>
            <li>I will start off saying what facial scrub you know that heats up a little when its rubbed between your hands with a little water to easily spread this thing.</li>
            <li>and I could swear the black heads on my nose were half their original size after one use.</li>
            <li>I have combination skin in the winter and this scrub/mask blasted right through that layer of dry skin and kept me oil free for days.</li>
            <li>Thought it would at least go on smoothly like a mask even though it&#x27;s grainy, but it was almost like putting wet sugar on my face and letting it sit there.</li>
            <li>Just clear, slightly pink skin remained.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> This is the best mask I&#x27;ve ever applied.</li>
            <li> It is incredibly grainy and should not be even considered a mask at all!</li>
            <li> this gives me a perfect balance of moisture.</li>
            <li> Excellent.</li>

            <li> Fab product, works the very best of anything I&#x27;ve tried over the years, even ProActive.</li>
            <li> But as a scrub, it is excellent.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s best used like a gommage and the sugar in it disolves in water, so no sticky residue or difficulty rinsing off!</li>

            <li> This stuff is AMAZING!</li>
            <li> The product is AMAZING!</li>
            <li> But, I just wanted to put it out there - while many people have great things to say about this (and maybe you will too!)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more of a scrub than a mask, but either way it made my skin feel great!</li>
            <li> If you can, spring water supplies the most benefits, hands down.research carrier oils and decide which is the best match for their skin type and needs and use it nightly-ESPECIALLY after using this.</li>
            <li> The smell was pleasant.</li>
            <li> It smells pleasant and makes my skin feel softer and SMOOTHER than any product I have tried.</li>
            <li> my skin feel so good after using this.</li>
            <li> It does feel good, though.</li>
            <li> I bought this thinking it would be good...</li>
            <li> feels good</li>
            <li> I read that charcoal masks were really good to control acne, so wanted to give charcoal a go.  </li>
            <li> It feels so nice when you put it on and it leaves your face feeling great</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kept my skin from overdrying and from getting too oily- a good balance for about 2 days after use.</li>
            <li> and I loved it.</li>
            <li> You can rest assured that you are getting a good exfoliation—</li>
            <li> Good product I&#x27;ve had a problem  </li>
            <li> clean/smooth smells good and taste good as well</li>
            <li> Good cleaner</li>
            <li> I have fair skin</li>
            <li> i purchased this mask along with freeman&#x27;s avocado and oatmeal mask, i had heard good things about charcoal for acne prone skin</li>
            <li> It is that good to me.</li>
            <li> This is a good product.  </li>
            <li> this smells so good</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good for washing your face but for some reason it&#x27;s not getting rid of my blackheads?</li>
            <li> Smells good.</li>
            <li> I would say this product would be good for a teenager that&#x27;s dealing with excess oil.  </li>
            <li> It smells good too.</li>
            <li> I have oily skin that is prone to breakouts and blackheads, I also have a fair complexion.  </li>
            <li> Great for those mornings/afternoons/evenings were you want to be in a nice bubble bath and relax.</li>
            <li> While it sounds good in theory in practice its not the easiest to apply.  </li>
            <li> It is so good.</li>
            <li> I am so happy I found a product that is easy on the wallet but still works!</li>
            <li> Love it, love it, love it!!!</li>
            <li> Wish it had been called &amp;#34;scrub&amp;#34; rather than &amp;#34;mask.&amp;#34; I think it is great as a scrub, but it does not stick to my face like I would expect of a coal mask, definitely more on the sugar side.</li>
            <li> Very refreshing on my skin.</li>
            <li> While this does make my skin feel great after I use it, I would classify it more as a scrub than a mask.</li>
            <li> Good price and nice results.</li>
            <li> really makes my face feel good, great expholiator!</li>
            <li> I use charcoal soap that works great, so I thought it would be a good fit.</li>

            <li> - Use after shower or have a damp warm face</li>
            <li> it is actually a nice moisturizing sugar scrub.  </li>
            <li> Feels warm going on.</li>
            <li> When you scrub on your face, it heats up and gets really warm, it&#x27;s so neat.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s kind of a burny tingle when u put it on, I like though.</li>
            <li> When you spread it on it heats up nicely.</li>
            <li> they are effective and dirt</li>
            <li> It was kind of soothing and warm.</li>
            <li> The product has a nice scent and is affordable.</li>
            <li> When I put it on, I feel a warm sensation on my face.</li>
            <li> Really nice cleaning product.  </li>
            <li> then i noticed that it felt kinda warm</li>
            <li> It has kind of a warming sensation, which I liked.</li>
            <li> Everyone always mentions how nice my skin has been looking lately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I am already getting compliments on how nice my skin looks.</li>
            <li> I let it set for about 5 minutes then began to exfoliate as directed, washed with warm water and</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read so many good reviews about this mask</li>
            <li> and I feel like I have tried every kind of product out there.</li>
            <li> When you put it on it makes your skin feel warm.</li>
            <li> But as a scrub I liked it.  </li>
            <li> The mask starts to feel warm when you rub it in</li>
            <li> scrubbed with a bit of warm water and washed off.</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s kind of the idea</li>
            <li> I really liked that there is charcoal in this</li>
            <li> kind of replaced my st Ives scrub.</li>
            <li> It has a nice warming sensation when on the skin.  </li>
            <li> so even is really nice.  </li>
            <li> When I used it, it had this nice warming sensation, which made me assume it was working.</li>
            <li> if you try to spread it, you kind of end up wiping it off instead.</li>
            <li> and it also has a nice fragrance.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This scrub/mask is the perfect consistency to me; it&#x27;s really grainy and feels like it&#x27;s getting the job done.</li>
            <li> I roll onto my face and it gets warm.</li>
            <li> love this smells good too</li>
            <li> This one was suggested by my best buddy with plain flawless skin!</li>
            <li> Very impressed, skin feels clean and smooth.</li>
            <li> Works great with my Gurin Face and Body Ultra Clean Brush 4-in-1 SPA Cleansing System</li>

            <li> best scrub i have used and gives me such a bright complexion im brown skin</li>
            <li> The product comes over very easy as well.</li>
            <li> thats ok because I still love how it works!</li>
            <li> Works great, after the first use my face was smooth and felt great.</li>
            <li> Tastes pretty good if it rinses into your mouth, but, of course, don&#x27;t ingest it!</li>
            <li> THE best &amp;  mostly ALL natural !!</li>
            <li> soft and flawless looking like this stuff!</li>
            <li> Love that it gets warm when it&#x27;s on.</li>
            <li> liked this mask mostly for the exfoliating effect the sugar has.</li>
            <li> /&gt;4/5 stars, I liked this product but Ididn&#x27;t love it,</li>
            <li> I need to repurchase this, it was fun to use and smelled great, and I feel like it thoroughly cleaned my face without being overly abrasive.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve made my own sugar scrubs better than this.  </li>
            <li> My skin is so soft and looks great!!!</li>
            <li> this was not one of the best choices i made as far as skin care.</li>
            <li> most amazing mask ive ever used.</li>
            <li> Really good value and smelled pretty good.</li>
            <li> It feels so wonderful to rub it on my skin and it smells great and has a slight warming tingly feeling too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m super happy :)</li>
            <li> it made my skin feel very smooth and made my moisturizer more effective.</li>
            <li> it has very nice ,fresh smell .</li>
            <li> It is awesome, my skin was instantly soft and looked better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty happy with it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product goes on to the skin very smooth which is a plus for me.</li>
            <li> The product has a very light citrus smell almost like grapefruit</li>
            <li> The pinkness immediately subsided and my skin felt very smooth.  </li>
            <li> My face was baby smooth, incredible really!</li>
            <li> It has a nice smell and is so easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> it feels really good when you put it on, even has a warm tingle to it when you first put it on.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s beautiful and I would HIGHLY recommend it.</li>
            <li> Very very good - makes my skin feel soft,</li>
            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very fair, sensitive combination skin and was looking for a charcoal mask that would suck out all the gunk.</li>
            <li> Love love love.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this mask twice and have fallen in love with it.</li>
            <li> As others have written, this is more of a scrub than a mask - except they want you to leave it on 5 minutes and then massage into your face for another 1-2.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I would classify this more like a &amp;#34;scrub&amp;#34; than a &amp;#34;mask&amp;#34; because of its grainy consistency.  </li>
            <li> I think there might be a better charcoal mask out there.</li>
            <li> so don&#x27;t hesitate; this item is fantastic!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be buying more.</li>
            <li> I love it the scrub.</li>
            <li> As others have mentioned it is more like a scrub than a mask.</li>

            <li> I love it......  </li>

            <li> Lovely and refreshing.</li>
            <li> I love Freeman&#x27;s products-</li>
            <li> Although I do like this product, I think it&#x27;s better to be categorized as an exfoliator.</li>
            <li> My skin tone looked more even.</li>
            <li> I love this polish mask.</li>
            <li> Love it</li>

            <li> truly love this product.</li>
            <li> think I have found the best combination of facial cleanser and makeup for my skin.</li>
            <li> The clearest, smoothest, and most even-toned skin I have had in years.</li>
            <li> In fact, I think this product would be better dubbed as solely an exfoliator.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this mask.</li>
            <li> and I love the warming effect it gave me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quite abrasive, so I suggest not to use it more than twice a week.</li>
            <li> ive used it 2x and it made my extremely smooth!</li>
            <li> Also one of my favorites :)</li>
            <li> My scars seemed to vanish, and my skin looked better than it has in YEARS.</li>
            <li> My skin is still clearer and in much better condition than it was before, so I&#x27;m still in love with this mask.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s more of a scrub than a mask, i wish the texture was creamier.</li>
            <li> and I will be buying more</li>
            <li> Overall, I am so impressed.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this mask.</li>
            <li> So glad I bought this because my face feels as smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom!</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I love this .</li>
            <li> But anyway love the product</li>

            <li> i love this stuff</li>
            <li> This mask pulled everything out and after about 2 weeks my skin looked and felt so much better.</li>
            <li> Though I think it could have been better packaged.  </li>
            <li> I love this scrub.</li>
            <li> Love the way it feels.</li>
            <li> (It&#x27;s more of an exfoliator</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I love the value of the Freeman masks and facials.  </li>
            <li> Absolutely love this scrub.</li>
            <li> This is a sugar-based product (glad it&#x27;s not those plastic micro beads though).</li>
            <li> It seems to be more of a scrub than a mask.  </li>
            <li> I gave this product five star, because it does what it says and more.</li>
            <li> more like a sugar scrub then a face mask..</li>
            <li> I love this mask, made my skin feel like a baby&#x27;s butt.</li>
            <li> I love this scrub.  </li>
            <li> My face feels and appears smoother than it has in many years.</li>
            <li> I was satisfied with the product but</li>
            <li> Really, it cleans well and does a great job of cleaning oily skin.</li>
            <li> Talk about refreshing</li>
            <li> and sometimes I use more to get my decolletage.</li>
            <li> I love all Freeman masks and this one is one of their best.&lt;br /&gt;Not</li>
            <li> tested on animals either :)</li>
            <li> love that it has charcoal in it too.</li>
            <li> Face feels so smooth afterwards !</li>
            <li> :)&lt;br /&gt;Anyhow</li>
            <li> My face is softer, my complexion is clearing up and skin tone is more even.</li>
            <li> I also love that the scrub is made from sugar</li>
            <li> I have an oily face (hence trying this product) and was paranoid that this mask was going to just make my face even more oily.</li>
            <li> I SIMPLY LOVE THIS MASK.EVERY MORNING</li>
            <li> DID I SAY I LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS MASK.</li>
            <li> my skin tone looks more even after using it.</li>
            <li> I love all freeman products.</li>
            <li> This one is my favorite.</li>
            <li> Product is more of a scrub not a mask.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ll buy more once I run</li>
            <li> Both my nephew and I love it.</li>
            <li> but most people don&#x27;t recommend sugar scrubs on your face</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Love this scrub/mask.</li>
            <li> I love the warming sensation when u rub the scrub on your skin</li>
            <li> Makes my face nice and smooth.</li>
            <li> Baking soda is a better exfoliator, anyway.</li>
            <li> Finding this product was an interesting experience.</li>
            <li> I love the way this makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li> My scars seemed to vanish, and my skin looked better than it has in YEARS.</li>
            <li> My skin is still clearer and in much better condition than it was before, so I&#x27;m still in love with this mask.</li>
            <li> Seems to be comprised mostly of granulated sugar.</li>
            <li> , you feel the charcoal more  on your face, then when I don&#x27;t fell it any more</li>
            <li> the consistency is more scrub like</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used most of Freeman&#x27;s masks and scrubs</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> Its more like an exfoliated goop you sort of pat onto your skin --</li>
            <li> Happy with this product,  shipping was fast also.</li>
            <li> and i love it.</li>
            <li> Right when you put it on its nice and warm.</li>
            <li> It heats up and draws out impurities -- in fact, the mask heats up FAST and gets very warm.  </li>
            <li> This is a very unique mask.</li>
            <li> I ordered it 3 days ago and it arrived a week early which is good!</li>
            <li> It also has a really nice unique warming effect.  </li>
            <li> You also get more for your money and it has a nice, sweet scent.</li>
            <li> Okay, I read a lot of really good reviews and was super excited to try this out for myself.  </li>
            <li> I think this is overpriced, but it is pretty good.</li>
            <li> it is pretty good ...</li>
            <li> I first bought this in the packet size because I had heard good things about using products with activated charcoal for oily, acne-prone skin (like mine).</li>
            <li> Surprising warmth at first....</li>
            <li> it ok for a scrub, but nothing special in my opinion!</li>
            <li> make sure you leave on your face the full amount of time it says!  </li>
            <li> it wont cleanse your pores very well but it can make your skin super smooth and glowing i highy reccommend this to everyone and plus its cheap which is awesome</li>
            <li> Once she found out how much she liked it she begged me to buy her a tube of her own.</li>
            <li> Your skin does feel really amazing after use, but do use a old wash cloth for the charcoal does stain good ones.</li>
            <li> This mask is awesome and left my skin beautifully smooth.  </li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this mask after hearing so many good things about it.</li>
            <li> I love the feel of  this, it&#x27;s best to wet your face then put this on</li>
            <li> Feels great, makes my skin really soft!</li>
            <li> Makes me feel so clean!</li>
            <li> Face feels really clean!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff, though the lid doesn&#x27;t clasp shut (which made it leak when being shipped to me) but other than that it cleans my face wonderfully</li>
            <li> Very high moisture, good price, good qualities, helps my skin so much smoother like a baby&#x27;s skin.</li>
            <li> Great value and leaves my skin soft.</li>
            <li> Great price-might compare to Lush&#x27;s &amp;#34;Dark Angels&amp;#34; charcoal scrub.</li>
            <li> It does a great job of cleaning my pores and smoothing my 56 year old skin.  </li>
            <li> love this-makes your skin so smooth</li>
            <li> but even after just one time my skin was so smooth and soft.i love this stuff</li>
            <li> The smell is a very calming sweet and it feels great on my skin.</li>
            <li> great product, my skin never felt so soft.</li>
            <li> Good gentle scrub for face.</li>
            <li> Reasonable price for good product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m buying one to send to my baby sister as a gift I loved it so much</li>
            <li> This stuff makes my face feel very smooth and clean from any dirt and oil.</li>
            <li> I repurchased the mini packet three or so times before I decided that I just need the full size one!</li>
            <li> So I first I love love love the smell of this product so yummy .</li>
            <li> The texture of the scrub is easily put on this way.</li>
            <li> Nothing permanent, but take it easy until you know what your skin will tolerate.&lt;br</li>
            <li> great facial for healthy glowing face.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s decent as a scrub but the charcoal doesn&#x27;t draw impurities out of pores like a good clay mask does.  </li>
            <li> While it was &amp;#34;fun&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;exciting&amp;#34; for me to try something new, I guess I just thought it worked great and decided to buy a full size.  </li>
            <li> my face looks good and feels soft!!</li>
            <li> , it was the Freeman Feeling Beautiful Clay Purifying Facial Mask, with 5/5 stars</li>
            <li> When first applied, there is a warming sensation, not to warm though.</li>
            <li> so I haven&#x27;t tried it more than once, but I am purchasing it on here now since I can&#x27;t find the full tube anywhere.</li>
            <li> It smells pretty nice...</li>
            <li> so I haven&#x27;t tried it more than once, but I am purchasing it on here now since I can&#x27;t find the full tube anywhere.</li>
            <li> I love how this leaves my face feeling smooth and clean.  </li>
            <li> It smells great and leaves my skin super soft!</li>
            <li> Amazon does a really good job of alerting me to new products.</li>
            <li> I typically have reactions to masks, this one was perfect and non-drying.  </li>
            <li> The scrub works just fine.</li>
            <li> It opens and closes perfectly fine.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many difference face wash brands and types for my super combination skin.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;ll break out into huge hives for weeks).</li>
            <li> I use this as a spot treatment, and legit, is the best all natural, or closest to all natural, thing i have used for spot treating blemishes.</li>
            <li> Skin feels smooth and renew</li>
            <li> It leaves your face smooth.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t expect it to go on smooth like a clay mask</li>
            <li> My face feels so smooth afterward.  </li>
            <li> I really liked to use this as a scrub, I didn&#x27;t seem much benefit from trying to use it as a mask.</li>

            <li> Kind of intense.  </li>
            <li> My face and neck are smooth.</li>
            <li> Fantastic.</li>
            <li> Then I rinsed it off with warm water while making circular motions to really exfoliate my face and OH MYGOODNESS.</li>
            <li> my face was really smooth.</li>
            <li> And the skin feels smooth to the touch.</li>

            <li> It makes it feel so smooth and</li>
            <li> silky smooth</li>
            <li> - maybe dab it lightly with a towel before applying the mask.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The scrub is gentle, my skin felt amazing</li>
            <li> and so that was important to me</li>
            <li> but I didint want to sacrifice smooth skin lol.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

            <li> very soft&lt;br /&gt;- smells nice</li>
            <li> The sugar in it is a great scrub and it actually works.</li>

            <li> My skin is as smooth as it is after a microderm for a fraction of the cost.</li>
            <li> Cheap.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews of this mask and since it&#x27;s so cheap</li>
            <li> This stuff is fantastic.  </li>
            <li> One said this was available at CVS</li>
            <li> Geez, this stuff was cheap; two for $7.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin so smooth.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s a huge bonus that it&#x27;s cruelty free.</li>

            <li> You can leave it on your skin for a good five to seven minutes and achieve what it claims -- clear, purified and exfoliated skin.</li>
            <li> I am sure with the right magnification you could see the damage you are doing.</li>
            <li> I would highly suggest this to anyone just make sure to use a moisturizer after!</li>
            <li> Awesome alternative to LUSH&#x27;s Dark Angels cleanser although to be honest</li>
            <li> It makes my skin feel smooth and fresh!</li>
            <li> I really love this mask, the smell is amazing and leaves my skin super soft.</li>
            <li> Afterwards my face did feel really smooth and clean.</li>
            <li> I use it once a week to exfoliate and it leave my skin smooth and clean.</li>
            <li> every time after using it skin become so clean and smooth.</li>
            <li> I am a firm believer that you need to take care of your skin every day for it to be healthy and beautiful.</li>
            <li> Firstly, it smells incredible; and finally, because, it smells</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone, it&#x27;s my new favorite mask!</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, the results are so amazing that I would still highly recommend this product, and I intend to keep using and buying it for myself.</li>
            <li> Well worth the small price, it&#x27;s effective, smells great and its so easy to use.</li>
            <li> I used it last night and my skin feels AMAZING!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff soooo much!</li>
            <li> disclosure: i have a pretty even skin complexion, but just wanted something to make my skin look more refreshed and glow.</li>
            <li> I was excited to get it.</li>
            <li> A very good sugar scrub and very gentle as long as you don&#x27;t over scrub.  </li>
            <li> I use this product and my skin felt so clean and fresh!</li>
            <li> But this mask/scrub threw me for a loop because it gave me a very significant result with the first use.</li>
            <li> Face feels clean after.</li>
            <li> I immediately felt like my face was clean and it made my face feel super smooth, too.  </li>
            <li> And I use it on my legs in combo with shaving to keep my skin super smooth.</li>
            <li> It made his skin super smooth and matte.</li>
            <li> I love this scrub, it does a great job of polishing away all the dead skin cells.</li>
            <li> It has a nice but light scent, and I say this as someone highly sensitive to smell, it doesn&#x27;t trigger my allergies or headaches at all.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best facial scrub I have tried!</li>
            <li> If it doesn&#x27;t, I&#x27;ll rinse it and clean it so it does.</li>
            <li> My face feels super smooth afterward.</li>
            <li> Its a grain similar to Tree Hut body scrubs (a bit grittier than a fine grain like most face washes), no odd odors, taste like sugar (obviously lol)</li>
            <li> have used other Freeman products, but this is absolutely the best.</li>
            <li> I certainly think it&#x27;s one of the better ones.&lt;br /&gt;People</li>
            <li> - don&#x27;t worry you&#x27;re doing it right!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s amazing makes my face feel so soft and clean</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had my fair share of using facial washes.</li>
            <li> The sugar makes it smell sweet</li>
            <li> This is cool.</li>
            <li> but it was a sweet scent.</li>
            <li> You can read my full review at BeautyApocalypse dot com.</li>
            <li> effect when you put this mask on your face and it is actually true.</li>
            <li> Leaving smooth and fresh skin.</li>
            <li> Once I scrubbed it off it did leave my skin nice and soft.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference in the oil levels of my skin, but everything else about this product description rings true.</li>
            <li> The real reward is the exfoliation after leaving it on 5-7 minutes, that&#x27;s when the magic happens.</li>
            <li> I used this scrub before reading the directions and found it to be just okay, but when I followed the instructions I could really tell the difference.</li>
            <li> Your skin feels...open...and cool....</li>
            <li> is that you dont need to leave it on forever like the clay masks to get the full effect.</li>
            <li> This scrub was ok, but I don&#x27;t feel it really did anything for my pores or texture of my skin.</li>
            <li> Love the intense scrub it produces.</li>
            <li> What cool about this product</li>
            <li> Heard that this was a good spa like deep cleanser.</li>
            <li> Some are saying it&#x27;s just a scrub and not a mask, and given the consistency, I can see why, but to get the full effect you need to use it as a mask.</li>
            <li> perfect.&lt;br /&gt;I licked it off my lips couple times, it&#x27;s so sweet</li>
            <li> Better luck purchasing a straight charcoal product and exfoliating with baking soda/powder.</li>
            <li> so much i will order more when needed</li>
            <li> I have to say the scrub have helped clean most of those stubbing build up on my faces making me look a bit more younger.</li>
            <li> and i feel fresh and clean after.</li>
            <li> Leaves your face feeling fresh &amp; clean.</li>
            <li> My skin feels and looks fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> Seller quick and undamaged.</li>
            <li> this mask in particular, I have seen many reviews that say it is not a mask, just a scrub.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery.</li>
            <li> but it goes away quickly.</li>
            <li> i enjoyed using the oatmeal and avocado mask also, i&#x27;ll definitely be trying more freeman products.</li>
            <li> I opened the package and saw they had taped the lid closed to make sure that it came nice and sealed and not squeezed into the mailing envelope.</li>
            <li> It turned out to be one of the best facial products I&#x27;ve purchased in awhile, especially in terms of value.</li>
            <li> It does a great job of &amp;#34;polishing&amp;#34; off the dead skin cells; my skin felt so smooth after I used it.</li>
            <li> to possibly describe how wonderful this facial scrub/mask is.</li>
            <li> It is a quick way to pamper yourself any time you want.</li>
            <li> Most face scrubs are very, very tough on the face, but this one is perfect.</li>
            <li> The texture just isn&#x27;t really right to be used as a mask, but it makes a good facial AND body scrub to be used in the shower.  </li>
            <li> I have a pineapple sugar scrup which is OK and the dead sea mineral clay mask which I love but the best thing about this black sugar mask</li>
            <li> It may feel kind of intense and rough but its amazing afterward.</li>
            <li> I have to stress how important it is to follow the instructions exactly....</li>
            <li> My first use of this product my skin was evenly smooth</li>
            <li> First I dampen my face to help the mask smooth on and stick during application</li>
            <li> But in the meantime if I use this product in the shower, very (very!)</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave a &amp;#34;squeaky clean&amp;#34; feeling, more of a natural clean if that makes sense.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This goes onto my list of Top 5 favorite scents along with pool-side chlorine scent, fresh green tea, snuggle, dinner, black sugar polish mask. :D</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin so soft and smooth and it feels so clean!</li>
            <li> My new favorite face mask.</li>
            <li> I have oily acne prone skin with lots of scarring and find that this product is great at making my skin feel less of an oil spill and smoother.  </li>
            <li> Not my favorite Freeman product by far, but not bad.</li>
            <li> My neck looked nice and my hands are soft and pretty.</li>
            <li> and after awhile when you get to the rinse stage it comes of really easy and leaves your skin SUPER smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> Hands down one of the best things I have come across as far as skin care</li>
            <li> Love the heat activation, wish I could find it in stores near me!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Now, my funny story!</li>
            <li> That only makes accidental swallowing while using in the shower better!</li>
            <li> Just very smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> Works great, can actually see it pull the gunk out of pores which is gross but great in the long run.</li>
            <li> My skin is silky soft and very smooth.  </li>
            <li> you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ironic thing in all of this is that after using it my kind looks so clear!</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend the black sugar and charcoal scrub to anyone looking to take better care of their skin.&lt;br /&gt;The warming sensation is a nice surprise as it feels nice.</li>
            <li> it works best if you really take your time and gently work it into your pores with a little bit of water for about two minutes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great exfoliator, without being harsh.</li>
            <li> Enjoy freeman mask so much.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s very shiny on your face and the sugar needs to get worked out to a smooth layer too.</li>
            <li> I rarely get pimples and it has helped reduce the number of blackheads on my nose and cheeks.</li>
            <li> I bought this at cvs once and liked it, this was the same one.</li>
            <li> and I rarely ever do reviews but felt compelled to write one for this.</li>
            <li> It felt like I had just sloughed off years worth of dirt and debris that had built up over 23 years.</li>
            <li> even their own facial cleansers didn&#x27;t take off my makeup like this product does.</li>
            <li> I got this to substitute my love for Lush&#x27;s charcoal sugar scrub, since that is pricier.</li>
            <li> The price for this was excellent and not quite as messy as Lush&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> This is a pretty sweet product.</li>
            <li> The warming sensation when you apply it is nice (especially in the winter!), and the scrub is not too abrasive.  </li>
            <li> , it leaved the skin nicely exfoliated and soft, ready for the serum and moisturizer (the mask itself moisturizes</li>
            <li> This stuff makes my face so soft, I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> The charcoal pulls the dirt out of your pores and leaves your skin fresh and exfoliated.</li>
            <li> I use this in the shower because its nice to get a big glob and work it on to your face.</li>
            <li> This product made my sensitive skin break out even more.</li>
            <li> Okay, so I have relatively sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I logged into Amazon I got a nice display of eczema products and this product which left me scratching my head.</li>
            <li> i give it 5 stars well worth the money.</li>
            <li> But I love the clear skin.</li>
            <li> This is much more cost efficient and works better than any other exfoliation product I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> A scrub that I can feel work, it goes on smooth and rinses off leaving my face feeling clean and clear.</li>
            <li> Leaves you feeling very clean and soft.</li>
            <li> If youcut yourself, nothing you put on it will heal it right away.</li>
            <li> This face mask gives you sensation of heat right after apply , it works as soon as you put it on...</li>
            <li> wonders cleared my forehead acne right up</li>
            <li> You can see and feel the difference right away.</li>
            <li> I saw a difference right away.</li>
            <li> Iam a female welder and it cleans my face so good and leaves my skin so soft!!</li>
            <li> My face felt so soft and fresh after!!</li>
            <li> The sugar crystals work very well and your skin feels so clean.</li>
            <li> I was surprised at first because it seems more like a scrub, but I applied it like a mask, let it sit for about 10 minutes then used it as a scrub.</li>
            <li> It leave my face super soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> It cleans my pores better than most scrubs and makes them appear less noticeable.  </li>
            <li> After the first use my face looked like a playdough fun factory.</li>
            <li> and the thing is it is such an amazing product for such a cheap price!</li>
            <li> not 100% sold until I woke up in the morning and washed my face with my normal moisturizing wash, my face was a smooth as baby&#x27;s skin.</li>
            <li> Amazing product gets rid of dry winter skin in one use.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After the mask my face felt squeaky clean and super soft.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know how wonderful it would feel, that it actually warms for a few seconds after you apply.</li>
            <li> It’s really not the most comfortable mask to have on one’s face.  </li>
            <li> it warms up quickly and i really like that aspect of the mask</li>
            <li> Mainly it is my nose area that feels squeaky clean.</li>
            <li> It has a nice warming quality and it is grainy enough that I can really feel it doing it&#x27;s job when I scrub it off.</li>
            <li> This one scrubs away dead skin cells and leaves a pleasant herbal fragrance.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t typically write a review but after one use of this product I loved it so much I had to!  </li>
            <li> Not only does is give my face a very clean fresh feel, but it also removes alot of dirt and oils.</li>
            <li> I use other Freeman products that I enjoy much more.</li>
            <li> I have other masks that I enjoy more than this one but still like the end results after.</li>
            <li> I was completely misguided by other review saying this was great.</li>
            <li> If you like heavy floral-ish scents, this will be great for you, but personally I was put off by the strong perfume.</li>
            <li> But it definitely felt/looked really clean, oil free and</li>
            <li> It does live you with an amazing clean smooth skin, I usually use it once a week and let it sit for about 15 mins then rinse off</li>
            <li> i love this stuff it leaves my face feeling and looking  nice and clear  plus its doesnt smells harsh ..</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s pretty transparent.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t experience the same overwhelming results that others are describing.</li>
            <li> you first pad it on, let it sit, then massage it around your face and rinse</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel any particular sensation after leaving it on for the recommended time, but once scrubbed off, my skin DOES feel super smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li> Can see a difference after first use</li>
            <li> I follow the instructions exactly</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> My skin is left looking healthy and refreshed.</li>
            <li> so I was interested in trying it out.</li>
            <li> When you first use it, you will understand why it seems that way.</li>
            <li> I have not had flakes since the day I first started using this product, about 2 months ago.</li>
            <li> I think the face is the first thing you have to take care</li>
            <li> but with this is like Gods gift not expensive</li>
            <li> Learn from my mistake ;)</li>
            <li> I have used many different apricot scrubs in the past, but I&#x27;m really glad I switched to this sugar scrub; it works so much better; doesn&#x27;t leave my face feeling like it&#x27;s been through the blender.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!!</li>
            <li> Every evening I apply Neutrogena Oil Free Acne Stress Control Triple Action Toner.  </li>
            <li> I plan on buying this charcoal again, most definitely!</li>
            <li> I absolutely adore this product!</li>
            <li> It is rather abrasive and daily use would mostly like irritate your skin</li>
            <li> I decided to try this product after seeing my face for the first time in about 1 1/2 yrs.</li>
            <li> My pores are larger than I thought, more discoloration.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s definitely made my skin smoother and more even toned.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s kind of crazy how it dries the acne but adds such great moisture (without an oily feeling)!</li>
            <li> I really like it!</li>
            <li> i really like this mask!</li>
            <li> I have been using Freeman facial masks for many years.</li>
            <li> The first time I used this mask, I could feel the difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> Soft and smooth skin resulted from weekly use of this product.</li>
            <li> You could just use sugar and lemon and get a better facial scrub.</li>
            <li> I do so love this mask, wish I could find this locally</li>
            <li> This mask and scrub has never failed me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After I used the product my complexion is smooth and clear.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say I love this product enough!</li>
            <li> Evidently, that was my mistake.</li>
            <li> Buy it and you won&#x27;t be sorry, it&#x27;s the best!!</li>
            <li> First, I didn&#x27;t purchase this through Amazon.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin feel so smooth and look so clear and glowing after I use.</li>
            <li> as you scrub it on your face, and when you wash it off: Ahh, I feel smooth and soft like a goddess and no residue, no redness, dryness, or &amp;#34;tight&amp;#34; feeling.</li>
            <li> When first applied, it feels like smearing honey on my face.</li>
            <li> I love that it&#x27;s not only a mask but a scrub for when you wash it off.</li>
            <li> When I first splash water onto my face to start scrubbing I feel a soothing warmth coming off the mask.</li>
            <li> but before I did, I went onto their website and decided to try the travel-sized packet first.</li>
            <li> I thought the mask did exactly as it claims to do: to rid your face of oil and impurities.</li>
            <li> THE FIRST THING I DO IS APPLY</li>
            <li> It feels soothing and not uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> you can see the results from the first use</li>
            <li> Cleans pretty well but leaves face a but oily.</li>
            <li> first time I ever bought a face mask</li>
            <li> Its good , keeps away the whit heads and isn&#x27;t too harsh on my face and neck.</li>
            <li> Its not chemically painful or super strong, and does a very good job with skin polishing and detox.</li>
            <li> Okay, so I&#x27;ve tried 3 different freeman masks over the last few months (Clay Mask, Charcoal and black sugar, &amp; Dead sea minerals) just to see which one I like best, and though I don&#x27;t think this one is the best I&#x27;ve used</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not doing to repurchase because I&#x27;ve still got half a bottle, and I&#x27;m still hoping to find that right kind of charcoal/sugar mask combination.</li>
            <li> I then scrub it a bit harder-my skin isn&#x27;t sensitive-and rinse whilst still scrubbing with decently warm (not hot) water.</li>
            <li> Anyway, the reason this mask is getting five stars from me is because holy cow is it an amazing exfoliator.</li>
            <li> and it leaves me skin so soft and clean.</li>
            <li> Just clean and soft.</li>
            <li> I like how this makes my skin feel soft and clean.</li>
            <li> Skin feel so soft and clean afterwards.  </li>
            <li> leaves my face feeling so soft and clean.</li>
            <li> And as far as the cap issue goes, I keep mine clean.</li>
            <li> I usually cannot tell the difference after the first use of the product but immediately I loved how my face looked and felt .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m rarely wowed by a beauty product, but I highly recommend this one.</li>
            <li> Most masks, your face is supposed to feel clean and tight.</li>
            <li> I have made this brand part of my skin routine because it leaves positive results.</li>
            <li> Having had such wonderful success with SkinFoods Black Sugar Foaming Scrub, I wanted to find some of the same elements plus charcoal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty gentle and doesn&#x27;t strip my skin.</li>
            <li> This product might be worth trying, but I think something with alpha hydroxy acid or some other type of acid exfoliator might produce better results for you.</li>
            <li> I used to get this product from those small packets in Wal-mart but decided I liked it so much I needed to save money and buy the full product.</li>
            <li> only thing I can add is that I also apply a light moisturizer to my face after bathing and I am looking so much better and younger.ter and younger.</li>
            <li> I use it once a week as part of my exfoliation routine and everytime my skin feels so soft and clean and very polished.</li>
            <li> It works well, I just wish the charcoal had a little bit more stick!</li>
            <li> The first time I used this my skin automatically went from oily and shiny to matte and normal!</li>
            <li> Leaves skin feeling new, looks shiny, and fresh.</li>
            <li> I think this would be better suited for dry skin types.</li>
            <li> I also have previously used Freeman masks and liked them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It leaves my face feeling super soft and I like the smell.</li>
            <li> mask leaves my face super soft.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe my face feels this clean, it definitely gives my hope for better skin in the future.</li>
            <li> When rinsed off my skin is super soft and I use it in conjunction with another product I like to control shine for hours.&lt;br</li>
            <li> After I got home from the gym I would wipe my face with a baby wipe, dampen my face with warm water, and put a generous amount of the Charcoal and Black Sugar Mask all over my face.</li>
            <li> and I love that it doesn&#x27;t strip my face dry.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe how soft my skin felt, and how quickly it removed blackheads.</li>
            <li> I would have preferred it to smell warm and sugary, like you&#x27;d expect, instead of slightly floral.     </li>
            <li> I am in my late thirties and although I&#x27;ve always had decent skin, I&#x27;ve noticed that as I age I seem to get more and more blackheads and clogged pores.</li>
            <li> Gone are the dry top layers.</li>
            <li> This is a 2 part mask and it leaves your skin super soft and supple.</li>
            <li> I am very particular and fussy when it comes to beauty products, but this made it to my keeper list.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This is gentle and smells sweet, pulls out impurities and leaves skin soft, supple, and without redness.</li>
            <li> Pure and natural!&lt;br /&gt;Maybe tasty.</li>
            <li> And even though I&#x27;m sure there isn&#x27;t really anyone out there who&#x27;d leave it on for this long, PLEASE DON&#x27;T DO THIS!</li>
            <li> And even though I&#x27;m sure there isn&#x27;t really anyone out there who&#x27;d leave it on for this long, PLEASE DON&#x27;T DO THIS!</li>
            <li> I love this scrub, I it scours off dry spots while still being gentle and I feel as if the charcoal purifies pores&lt;</li>
            <li> ONLY good thing I can say about this stuff is that it didn&#x27;t dry out my skin</li>
            <li> Over the next two months I went to Walmart on a weekly basis only to get more!</li>
            <li> It has a really good smell, it&#x27;s kinda hard to explain</li>
            <li> Like I couldn&#x27;t stop touching my face, it was so soft but at the same time it felt clean and the good part is that it doesn&#x27;t feel all dry and tight and</li>
            <li> Other than that, it makes my face super smooth.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel clean and soft and like new.</li>
            <li> This cleanses really nice, but very abrasive on skin, and it goes on patchy  not smooth for a mask.  </li>
            <li> but I leave it on for about 10 minutes and gentle scrub for 2 and my face feel baby soft and fresh.</li>
            <li> This works really well as an exfoliant and always leaves my skin feeling soft and fresh.</li>
            <li> I love the rough granules in it which makes it really feel like you&#x27;re sandblasting your face.  </li>
            <li> Much gentler on skin.  </li>
            <li> Now my whole forehead is peeling.  </li>
            <li> well, not so much now.</li>
            <li> This is my absolute go to face mask/scrub whenever my pores are a tad too noticeable.</li>
            <li> The charcoal benefit works very well and the sugar scrub is an added bonus as a two-in-one product.  </li>
            <li> but I wouldn&#x27;t really call it a mask.</li>
            <li> Could there really be a product</li>
            <li> It really does help with clearing out impurities.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> And the prices is beyond reasonable.</li>
            <li> I have very shiny, oily skin (but no acne)</li>
            <li> I only happened to glance at this product on the shelf at my local grocery store, and it was such a great price that I thought, &amp;#34;Why not?&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really really picky with my face</li>
            <li> and it really works</li>
            <li> But I have never tried something that changed my skin so much after one use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sticky and just really wasn&#x27;t what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I have tried everything, nothing has ever made much of a difference besides fry or burn out my skin.</li>
            <li> i have very oily skin</li>
            <li> It works very well.</li>
            <li> (so that may or may not happen).&lt;br /&gt;It makes my skin so much smoother and softer each time I use it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d have appreciated knowing ahead of time.</li>
            <li> and I probably won&#x27;t continue to use it much except maybe to exfoliate in the shower once in a while.&lt;br /&gt;In case</li>
            <li> (I don&#x27;t have much of an oil problem, I break out after vigorous workouts and when I get my period)</li>
            <li> I have REALLY oily skin and a lot of blackheads on my nose</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin</li>
            <li> The warming sensation is gentle and you can feel it working.</li>
            <li> I actually have used it on my feet, made the heels feel wonderfully smooth.</li>
            <li> It has really helped me with my blackhead problems that are caused by using self tanners.</li>
            <li> highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I also used it on my brother and his skin is very oily.</li>
            <li> It is a real money saver, if you want a scrub and detox for the price of one.</li>
            <li> Went through a whole tube before I paid attention to the directions to use it as a mask.</li>
            <li> I do recommend this for anyone with really oily skin like mine.</li>
            <li> While I was rinsing it out I could instantly feel how smooth my skin was.</li>
            <li> I really recommend this mask.</li>
            <li> At 36, I had very noticeable pores.</li>
            <li> With this, I can&#x27;t tell much of a difference.</li>
            <li> I decided to try this verision out because I really like scrubs.</li>
            <li> i want to eat it off my face it really works</li>
            <li> I then sit and watch some TV - the whole time massaging it into my skin.</li>
            <li> You really cannot beat it.</li>
            <li> My face was a lovely shade of pink when finished, and I was amazed at how well this sticky material washed off my face.  </li>
            <li> Gentle scrub.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really pull the oil from my skin, but does exfoliate well and make my face feel like a baby&#x27;s butt.</li>
            <li> And really you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li> I am 47 and my skin gets very congested around my chin.</li>
            <li> Fantastic facial mask.</li>
            <li> I was very nervous to try this product because I have acne prone combination skin, so a lot of brands can be iffy and cause me to break out.</li>
            <li> After, I gently rub the oil in, ALWAYS in an upward massage.</li>
            <li> Since doing so, I have stopped getting any &amp;#34;monthly&amp;#34; acne, the texture of my face has become even, and while the lines aren&#x27;t gone they do appear much softer.</li>
            <li> Sugar scrubs are gentler on the skin than microbeads too, so I really like it for that reason.</li>
            <li> But a gentle massage is</li>
            <li> I really like it.  </li>
            <li> this did not help me much with exfoliation and did not make my skin clearer.</li>
            <li> and the fact that real sugar was used.</li>
            <li> The smell of this product is very therapeutic to me.</li>
            <li> Charcoal really pulls out the impurities in the skin and</li>
            <li> I will continue to use on a weekly basis and see if I notice real change after a couple of months.</li>
            <li> The sugar is a bit much for me.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it &amp;#34;purged&amp;#34; my skin as much as caused a reaction.</li>
            <li> It came much quicker than I was expecting.</li>
            <li> but when I saw a larger bottle was available</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really feel a difference.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t out much $</li>
            <li> Works very well on my face.</li>
            <li> mask isn&#x27;t really a mask.</li>
            <li> gently scrubbing and ignoring the smell</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m slightly sensitive and while I enjoyed the heat, I also didn&#x27;t want to overdo it and let it sit for only 7 minutes before moving on to the scrubbing in part --</li>
            <li> I would&#x27;ve rated it 5 stars but saw the same product at a drug store today for the same product but 2-1 deal which kind of bummed me out.</li>
            <li> However, Lush&#x27;s left my skin looking better.</li>
            <li> This mask is effective because the sugar removes the dead skin on my face with gentle rubs while the oil in it moisturizes.</li>
            <li> kind of thing, but for the price and ease of use, it&#x27;s definitely worth at least a try.</li>
            <li> It keeps my skin very soft and clean, i no longer have breakouts and my skin stays very even and just has a natural glow to it when I&#x27;m not wearing</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure if you were supposed to wash your face before or dampen it, so I just put it straight into my dry face (still not sure to be honest).</li>
            <li> and after your skin is SO SOFT!!!</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t mean it won&#x27;t do good for your skin.  </li>
            <li> this is the only charcoal scrub/mask that had such a high rating and such great feedback</li>
            <li> but other than that I love it</li>
            <li> Anything with charcoal affects the friendly flora of the facial skin</li>
            <li> Have not been using long enough to really  give it a nice review.</li>
            <li> (since getting the tube) is putting a fair amount in one palm, a glob just larger than a silver dollar and a half.</li>
            <li> I used to use a popular apricot scrub and the small granules would get stuck in my pores.</li>
            <li> I was surprised the first time I put this on, it almost felt like putting a heating pad to my face.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It has a nice scent, and feels nice, but it&#x27;s difficult to actually get on the face.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin, so I didn&#x27;t test this product on a test patch of skin first.</li>
            <li> Felt nice but Broke me out :-/. So I stopped.</li>
            <li> If you can, spring water supplies the most benefits, hands down.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a professional esthetician and have used the most expensive, high end versions of this kind of scrub</li>
            <li> spanking brand new!  </li>
            <li> My face was as soft as my hands, and I&#x27;ve never felt such a huge difference in the texture of my skin with just one use of something.</li>
            <li> It was easy to apply with the fan brush, I just squeezed out some on the brush, then carefully applied it to a section my face at a time.  </li>
            <li> :  I recommend applying some sort of light, oil-free moisturizer to ensure that your face doesn&#x27;t get too dry and then flake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;the consistency is odd, as most would expect a mask to be thick/gunky but it truly gets the job done.</li>
            <li> then lightly coat with monoi tiare oil and let in sit as I dry off.  </li>
            <li> I have very oily, acne prone skin that really responds well to exfoliation,  but if you have sensitive skin, this might be too &amp;#34;scrubby&amp;#34; for you.</li>
            <li> If you can get a decent coat of it on your face</li>
            <li> the directions don&#x27;t mention to wash your face first but it only makes sense to do that first..</li>
            <li> If you have very sensitive skin, you may find this a bit too much for your skin to handle.</li>
            <li> I ordered three Freeman facial masks at the same time and when they arrived, this one was my least favorite, but now that I&#x27;ve learned how to use it, I LOVE it!  </li>
            <li> Use it after a long day before going to bed , never disappointed me.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have high expectations for this at all.</li>
            <li> , I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this to everyone.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this mask.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This is the only mask I&#x27;ve tried that made a visible change after the first use!</li>
            <li> But its kind of hard to spread it evenly though.</li>
            <li> While I didn&#x27;t necessarily see an improvement in blackhead reduction, it makes my face super soft!</li>
            <li> Better than my other $60 mask!!</li>
            <li> I have VERY oily and sensitive skin, and have tried just about everything from scrubs, peels, masks, wipes, and prescriptions.</li>
            <li> it goes on like smooth wet sugar .</li>
            <li> it can&#x27;t stay on long, at least from what I&#x27;ve experienced.</li>
            <li> I leave the mask on for about 7 minutes and scrub away, and afterwards my skin feels sooooo soft and my pores feel like they can breathe again, haha.</li>
            <li> (it was... not a good thing, lol), so I left it on longer.</li>
            <li> Maybe all the harsh products, benzoyl peroxide, proactiv etc were just drying out the top layer of my skin and</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend this product if you want an effective, low cost, low maintenance way of taking care of your skin!</li>
            <li> I love to use everyday after work</li>
            <li> This facial has such a nice smell to it, but I will say if you&#x27;re sensitive to strong perfume like scents then this may not be for you since the smell is strong and a little heavy.</li>
            <li> I put my hands into the water to get a little more and my hands felt so soft it startled me!</li>
            <li> Love it and it seems to have a slight warming effect!</li>
            <li> Never makes my face feel dry just smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li> noticed that my skin was so much more clear and that my pores appeared less noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> last right before I got out.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m currently writing this review right after that,</li>
            <li> When I looked in one of those mirrors with the 2 sides (you know one side is huge the other is kinda normal)</li>
            <li> I have a UV(sun) allergy; while that is it&#x27;s own problem, it causes a lot of other complications with my skin in the long run.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m starting to get tiny fine lines, but @ 42</li>
            <li> You have all the other masks available at the stores can we please have lots of these going out everywhere?</li>
            <li> I had purchased the small sample packet awhile back, and liked it so much, I had to order a bottle.</li>
            <li> Though it kind of &#x27;shifted&#x27; a little, it wasn&#x27;t gooey enough to have drips fall into my lap, or on my clothes etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A tip that I have is to wet face with pretty warm water to open the pores then dry it</li>
            <li> This mask almost creates new looking skin.</li>
            <li> I decided to try something new and bought this product.</li>
            <li> husband ordered this for me and it appeared to be in new condition.  </li>
            <li> Use twice a week and your skin will be like new..</li>
            <li> This one arrived within a day or so and was well packaged and brand new.  </li>
            <li> Then I VERY lightly scrub in small circles, to let the product start working into my skin.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re looking for something to refresh your skin and clean out your pores, reduce scars, and acne, and a rough scrub</li>
            <li> the black sugar really makes your complexion feel soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not really convinced that the charcoal is truly an &amp;#34;active&amp;#34; ingredient that draws impurities out of the skin, but more that the grainy paste exfoliates the upper layers of the skin.  </li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and this product does not irritate it.</li>
            <li> My face did feel cleaner, looked brighter, and was very soft.</li>
            <li> Helped clear up my complexion too!</li>
            <li> So, so clear!</li>
            <li> This is pretty graphic, but I have to say..</li>
            <li> My fav so far !</li>
            <li> Leaves your skin so soft!</li>
            <li> This is one of those products that actually made a difference from the first time I used it.</li>
            <li> I followed the directions exactly and left it on for 7 minutes and then scrubbed for two minutes in the bath.</li>
            <li> Wal-mart sells small packets like a sample size so try it and see for your self. :)</li>
            <li> It is a bit different than other masks you may have tried, since it doubles as a scrub, but once you get over the porous like texture, you will love it.</li>
            <li> When you give it any friction whatsoever, it begins to actually feel hot.</li>
            <li> The cost was enough to get me interested.</li>
            <li> Overnight, my skin seemed to change completely!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll use it 2-3 times a week in the shower with an exfoliating brush and my skin feels so soft afterwards!</li>
            <li> From now on I&#x27;ll leave the mask on as directed and do what I was doing before; no more experiments, I&#x27;m concerned about my skin even more.</li>
            <li> From now on I&#x27;ll leave the mask on as directed and do what I was doing before; no more experiments, I&#x27;m concerned about my skin even more.</li>
            <li> Overnight, my skin seemed to change completely!</li>
            <li> then when I started scrubbing I just wet my fingers and scrubbed and rinsed with cool water to close the pores</li>
            <li> I recommend applying over a sink because it&#x27;s easy to drop little chunks of the sugar, though once it&#x27;s on</li>
            <li> Although the oil problem was not as bad as when I used the Anti-Stress Dead sea mask, it was still more than I care to deal with on a regular basis.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve also used this product as a quick scrub in a shower and that works great to exfoliate as well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Blackheads had been hiding away for who knows how long, came sliding right out.</li>
            <li> Giving 4 stars because it goes on kind of weird at first.</li>
            <li> It may cause a breakout after the first 2 weeks (i use it 2x a week), but after a month my skin is definitely cleaner, more clear, and less red.</li>
            <li> Also it leaves my skin with a healthy glow over the course of 24hour and over time reduces the old but very few acne scars I  had.</li>
            <li> It smells naturally sweet without a lot of added chemical scents that some other products may have.</li>
            <li> applied this with a large fan paint brush, the same type of brush</li>
            <li> It really does clean the skin and get the dirt out of the pores without doing any excessive damage.</li>
            <li> For makeup, I use a fingertip sized amount of Almay Clear Complexion makeup (in beige 500) mixed with a drop of Clean &amp; Clear Dual Action salicylic acid Moisturizer and a drop of either Clean &amp; Clear Mattifying Moisturizer or the Neutrogena Shine Control primer (rice protein complex).</li>
            <li> The consistency of this stuff takes a little getting used to, it&#x27;s thinner than a traditional mask and feels more like an exfoliating scrub.</li>
            <li> It was hard to distribute making me use alot more then intended.</li>
            <li> most of them either dry my skin out, cause redness, and flaking/peeling while other did nothing to help.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m seeing everything so clearly, including my face.</li>
            <li> This is not a charcoal mask just to be clear</li>
            <li> and this also help clear up the skin.</li>
            <li> pores look clear and clear .</li>
            <li> You apply the stuff to your face and neck, let it sit, which is when the activated charcoal works to clear your pores, and then after 5-10 minutes you scrub your face with it which exfoliates your face.</li>
            <li> Makes your skin soft</li>
            <li> My skin glows afterwards and is really soft.</li>
            <li> My cheeks are sensitive</li>
            <li> It does leave your skin soft.</li>
            <li> If you have a Walmart near by, they always have sample packets of the Freeman masks for you to try.</li>
            <li> Leaves you soft as a baby&#x27;s...</li>
            <li> Like some have said, though, this mask isn&#x27;t really a &amp;#34;mask.&amp;#34; It says to layer it on your skin and then leave for several minutes before rubbing off.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really think that&#x27;s necessary.</li>
            <li> with my face being red and scaly around my nose and forehead  since using this product haven&#x27;t had much to none  </li>
            <li> Second, I don&#x27;t see much improvement in my clogged pores when I use this.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Skin was soft and silky.</li>
            <li> and you will not believe how soft your skin feels.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I leave this on for ten minutes, then scrub gently as I rinse off.</li>
            <li> Once I rinsed my face I could feel how soft my skin felt.</li>
            <li> once you&#x27;re done your face will feel SO SOFT.</li>
            <li> i have sensitive skin and didn&#x27;t have any adverse effects from using it.</li>
            <li> It took off all of my professional makeup.....</li>
            <li> My skin was so soft.</li>
            <li> I followed the directions completely.</li>
            <li> , but so far I don&#x27;t see any signs of a reaction.</li>
            <li> I have really sensitive skin</li>
            <li> One caveat is using it on sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Let me tell you, I use an exfoliating face wash with the soft scrubs and everything.</li>
            <li> I put it on directly after a shower or a steam to the face.</li>
            <li> Now, just because it doesn&#x27;t do anything for my skin (combination with the early stages of wrinkles trying to form</li>
            <li> think that this mask and scrub will work for any skin type because it is not harsh in any way.</li>
            <li> When you scrub this stuff off your face, you automatically have baby soft skin on your face.</li>
            <li> some going so far as to say 27.</li>
            <li> I pair it with the Charcoal face bar from Lush, and done.</li>
            <li> My skin is so clear and soft</li>
            <li> Makes skin feel so soft.</li>
            <li> If you want to have absolutely incredibly soft skin I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Makes my face so soft</li>
            <li> Makes skin amazingly soft</li>
            <li> The scale from my eczema was gone, completely gone.</li>
            <li> This facial scub works really well.</li>
            <li> HOLY CANNOLI was my face soft after</li>
            <li> It helps control the oil on my face and leaves it feeling so soft.</li>
            <li> SO SO SO SOFT.</li>
            <li> I have ordered multiple times from this seller and the shipping is ridiculously fast.</li>
            <li> Enough to spread/pat out the mask, but also was okay with a few spots of skin tone peeking through here and there under lighter-coated spots.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t able to make it more than about 45 seconds when trying to gently massage my face - the sugar crystals are too large, sharp,  and painful.</li>
            <li> I mean, like, an hour or two later you still smell like you rolled in a rose bush.</li>
            <li> Smells pretty good, but hard to spread on your face, if you try to smear it on like a regular mask, little chunks of this will fall off all over your counter.</li>
            <li> and my skin stays red for a little while after, but feels clean!</li>
            <li> i just love the crazy clean feeling your skin gets after using this product.  </li>
            <li> Your face will feel a bit dry afterward, but some facial lotion will quickly fix that.</li>
            <li> and it even tastes a little sweet when it gets near your mouth.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Me: 34, occasional breakouts (from what I hear, they are hormonal around my age), oily skin (hey, less wrinkles down the road!), fair</li>
            <li> This mask is a bit messy but I like the warming effect and how clean my skin feels afterwards.</li>
            <li> I have been buying more expensive products and I am glad I happened upon the charcoal and black sugar scrub.</li>
            <li> The only thing I was initially hesitant about was the consistency, which is pretty gooey.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Instead, the granules in the mask are not black sugar, but microscopic plastic balls used to mimic the sugar crystals.</li>
            <li> Since I already use a couple of charcoal based products mainly for the tiny blackheads on my nose, I read the reviews for this.</li>
            <li> so if it gets on your lips, yes it is a little sweet</li>
            <li> My skin looks and feels so clean and is softer and smoother than with any other individual mask, scrub or combination of the two that I&#x27;ve ever</li>
            <li> Highly recommend especially for the price.</li>
            <li> It gently removes all the dead skin cells, leaves my face as smooth as a baby&#x27;s butt, and I swear my pores are three times smaller after using this mask for the last month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> When applying to face it can be a little messy but the warming sensation is such a good feeling.  </li>
            <li> Depending on how much time I have and how clogged my pores feel, I sometimes let it set for as long as 25 minutes.</li>
            <li> Smells FABULOUS, sugary but not overwhelming.</li>
            <li> I have fairly sensitive skin and am not a big fan of physical exfoliants for my face unless they&#x27;re really gentle.</li>
            <li> I then washed it off with cool water, took a shower, and dried off.</li>
            <li> It is kind of annoying to apply because it drips and never fully dries, but I just put a towel over my lap and it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li> I mean I like this not only because of that feature but because its pretty much true of what it afvertised.</li>
            <li> After I try a new face wash, I always perform an effectiveness test by wiping my forehead with a damp paper towel after washing my face to see if any dirt was left over.  </li>
            <li> Normally squeaky clean &#x3D; dry and tight.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gentle enough to wear every day, multiple times a day, no redness or drying!</li>
            <li> I also have very sensitive skin because I&#x27;m a red head and not once has this product irritated my skin.</li>
            <li> Most face scrubs make the skin extra dry and make your skin feel tight, but this one doesn&#x27;t do that at all.</li>
            <li> I did follow other reviewers instructions to use after taking a hot shower, to get some steam-action working.</li>
            <li> I sat in front of my computer and played a few games while still very aware I had the mask on my face.</li>
            <li> I was interested in trying this as a low-cost alternative to active charcoal masks found in high-end beauty stores, like Sephora.  </li>
            <li> Plays music very clear and loud, fits better than Apple earbuds and not as expensive.</li>
            <li> Really rough, with large crystals.</li>
            <li> but I mainly wanted to write a review to say that the same bottle is only $3.50 at CVS!!</li>
            <li> Probably useful if you have pretty tough skin</li>
            <li> It felt hot on my face, and after using it I feel like my pores looked more dirty than they did before I used the mask.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty difficult to find a smooth, non-bumpy patch of skin on face at the moment.</li>
            <li> Although I am a regular customer of Amazon, why would anyone pay $9.99 when you can buy directly from Freeman Beauty&#x27;s website for $3.99 each?</li>
            <li> Left it on for 10 minutes, scrubbed for 2 minutes and had an ultra soft face.</li>
            <li> I thought I was having a reaction, but apparently this happens every time.</li>
            <li> the formula is not rough on my skin.</li>
            <li> But after 5 miniutes and 2 of scrubing it left my skin exstreamly soft.</li>
            <li> This product not only refreshed my skin but also helped scrub away old acne scars.</li>
            <li> This happens to me after I get a professional facial as all the work draws impurities to the surface.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Because I use the oil religiously, this product has never dried my skin out.</li>
            <li> My skin feels so soft when I use it, and I have to admit that the tiny blackheads I had are gone now.</li>
            <li> My skin feels so soft when I use it, and I have to admit that the tiny blackheads I had are gone now.</li>
            <li> Oh my goodness, especially if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Oh my goodness, especially if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> while at the same time fighting dry flakes in certain areas.</li>
            <li> For a product so inexpensive compared to other, high-end masks, it certainly delivers every bit it promises.</li>
            <li> But it really does shrink your pores, get that dirt out, without dehydrating your skin (btw, big difference between dry skin and dehydrated skin).</li>
            <li> After waiting 7 minutes I massaged the scrub in my face with damp hands for two minutes, rinsed, patted my face dry and then moisturized as normal.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry like normal masks</li>
            <li> I use the Freeman Facial Charcoal &amp; Black Sugar every other day and it leaves my skin so clean and clear.  </li>
            <li> and this is gentle enough for my sensitive skin but rough enough to actually work!</li>
            <li> Charcoal face masks have been hyped up a lot on social media</li>
            <li> After I rinsed, I couldn&#x27;t believe that my face was not dry at ALL.</li>
            <li> No blackheads, no whiteheads, no dry skin.</li>
            <li> The smell is nice and the texture was a little weird at first but the results definitely out weigh that.</li>
            <li> The trick is that you need to splash a little water on your face first and then apply and scrub.  </li>
            <li> I first tried this mask from the little sample size they sell at Walmart.  </li>
            <li> I have tried a few different scrubs over the past year, but this is by far my favorite.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s abrasive but gentle and unlike scrubs that used ground nut shells and other coarse ingredients, the sugar will not clog your pores because it melts.</li>
            <li> Makes your skin feel soft for long time but did not work on my pores</li>
            <li> Same with all other Freeman products, much cheaper at your local drug store.</li>
            <li> mask is way different than any other clay type mask, more like a thick, oozy sugar scrub that sits on your face.  </li>
            <li> I read that black sugar works wonders and it really does</li>
            <li> Aside from the slight polishing affect of rubbing the sugar on and off your face, this doesnt really do anything.</li>
            <li> I found out about this line of facial products via social media.</li>
            <li> I have used scrubs in the past that have removed the dead skin from my face for the most part.</li>
            <li> Keep in mind it will not dry or harden like a regular mask, so</li>
            <li> I will start off saying what facial scrub you know that heats up a little when its rubbed between your hands with a little water to easily spread this thing.</li>
            <li> and I could swear the black heads on my nose were half their original size after one use.</li>
            <li> I have combination skin in the winter and this scrub/mask blasted right through that layer of dry skin and kept me oil free for days.</li>
            <li> Thought it would at least go on smoothly like a mask even though it&#x27;s grainy, but it was almost like putting wet sugar on my face and letting it sit there.</li>
            <li> Just clear, slightly pink skin remained.</li>
            <li> Many people comment on the crumbly  mess and roughness of the sugar bits; Just apply small amounts and remember the skin on your face is naturally sensitive so with anything you apply to your face: slowly and SOFTLY!  </li>
            <li> also really recommend the freeman facial charcoal and black sugar mud mask!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little messy, but it is worth it!</li>
            <li> I used it once and most my black heads were gone!!!!!</li>
            <li> and I very rarely have any difficulties with skincare products irritating my skin.  </li>
            <li> It really feels like the granules are scrubbing off the bad layers of skin and makes your skin feel super soft.</li>
            <li> Lush Dark Angels charcoal scrub is very similar.</li>
            <li> you want a charcoal cleanser that actually works, you should try Dark Angels from Lush.</li>
            <li> And with me going vegan over the last few years I been trying to find replacements for all my normal face wash line-up for a while now.</li>
            <li> The good news is that I don&#x27;t see any noticeable damage and it didn&#x27;t leave my skin red (but did make the peeling around my nose quite worse), but even though there isn&#x27;t anything I can see, there was definitely something that caused the irritating burn and possibly some damage to my skin that I have yet to find out about.</li>
            <li> The good news is that I don&#x27;t see any noticeable damage and it didn&#x27;t leave my skin red (but did make the peeling around my nose quite worse), but even though there isn&#x27;t anything I can see, there was definitely something that caused the irritating burn and possibly some damage to my skin that I have yet to find out about.</li>
            <li> It leaves your skin very soft and has a slight warming sensation as you put it on.</li>
            <li> May be hard to apply at first</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a really low price to compare with lots other brands, and I&#x27;ve seen bunch of other reviews talking about how high the cost performance is, but still &amp;#34;WHAT A SURPRISE!&amp;#34; when I use it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is possible to use this as a mask, but it is very gloopy and hard to apply as such.</li>
            <li> I was really hoping that it would have real black sugar crystals.</li>
            <li> The only thing that could be not natural would be fragrance....</li>
            <li> but is just not sensitive enough for my skin.</li>
            <li> The texture is a little odd when you first put it on, but once you recognize that it&#x27;s really not a traditional mask, you&#x27;ll get over it.</li>
            <li> Granted, it doesn&#x27;t last very long, but I haven&#x27;t found a mask that does.</li>
            <li> after two day my skin is visibly cleaner, noticeably less oily, my skin is soft, and is clearing up.</li>
            <li> I use it as a daily wash and sometimes leave it on to dry as a mask/</li>
            <li> It doesnt dry like a regular mask</li>
            <li> My skin is left glowing and soft without being clogged or dry, and I noticed some whiteheads drying up and less blackheads.</li>
            <li> Dry with the occasional breakout.</li>
            <li> Goes on lumpy and gritty and doesnt really dry in a way that the mark can be peeled off.</li>
            <li> I have very dry and sensitive skin, but because I workout outdoors and have to wear makeup for my job, my pores get dirty easily.</li>
            <li> I have a few new spots that were appearing and also a few areas that just won&#x27;t clear up.</li>
            <li> The major difference is that Dark Angels works, and this doesn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it is highly scented and my face breaks out to it sometimes.</li>
            <li> Gets all the dead skin off and leaves my skin feeling soft.</li>
            <li> Been using this product for a long time now.</li>
            <li> smells like perfume and has a strange consistency.</li>
            <li> &quot; feeling lasts for quite a long time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m looking forward to seeing the long term effects.</li>
            <li> The product rubs all the dead skin completely off, and leaves the skin feeling rejuvenated.</li>
            <li> and I hope after long term use it helps with blackheads.</li>
            <li> Just leave on too long.</li>
            <li> I have been using Freeman Cucumber Facial Peel-Off Mask for years and got curious about the rest of their line.</li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t break me out but caused strange, pustules all over my face.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve been looking for a polishing mask for so long</li>
            <li> /&gt;It feels very grainy and thick</li>
            <li> Recently finding that if your diet is on point, you sleep, drink water, and keep stress down with regular exercise, then it is your products.</li>
            <li> I always end up with dry skin after washing my face no matter how hard I scrub or how much lotion I put on.</li>
            <li> AND if you left the mask on prior to scrubbing, all the excess oil the charcoal pulled to the surface, the black sugar will remove.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used Freeman Facial Charcoal &amp; Black Sugar Mask and Scrub last night as directions indicate after washing my face.  </li>
            <li> I live on a small budget</li>
            <li> With most exfoliation products, aside from a simple scrub brush, a little bit of oil is to be expected but this was an uncomfortable amount that I had to wipe away 2 or 3 times before I went to bed, and I woke up with an oily face in the morning.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll never buy the more expensive brands again !</li>
            <li> I actually bought this product at my local Rite-Aid for a little over $3</li>
            <li> have not yet used it daily but every other day.</li>
            <li> Disappointed in this one, definitely would spend the money for a better product next time.</li>
            <li> so I know it helps moisturize my skin and will dissolve and not pollute the ocean like other scrubs that use tiny plastic pieces.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s rather hard to apply because you can&#x27;t really rub it into your skin without it feeling rough, you have to pat it on.</li>
            <li> First, it is very hard to apply as a mask.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry like clay masks do.  </li>
            <li> Hours after rinsing and being out in about my face feels moisturized but not oily; I have notoriously dry skin.</li>
            <li> Everything I tried, even those cleansers that are meant to be milder on the skin (Basis, Burt&#x27;s Bees), would leave my face feeling dry within minutes.</li>
            <li> With \\&quot;mask\\&quot; in the name, you&#x27;d think it would dry like a clay mask, it doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> When I patted my face dry</li>
            <li> I have dry, acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> You put it on and it doesn&#x27;t dry at all.  </li>
            <li> some parts are oily some parts are dry .</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t dry you out.</li>
            <li> I get out, wrap my hair, and pat dry my face...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not tested on animals, has no sulfates to dry out the skin, and has no parabens that could be carcinogenic.</li>
            <li> My dry skin was gone, too.</li>
            <li> Second, I have that oily Mediterranean skin that actually ALWAYS needs hydration and feels rough a slick at the same time.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t press too hard or for too long, I overdid it once and my very sensitive skin didn&#x27;t appreciate it.</li>
            <li> at least once, it does not feel like a normal mask, which is why I think people are unsatisfied with the product, but it is to be used as a mask.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t loose at the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I prefer my Healing Tree black charcoal soap and PureSol Bamboo charcoal konjac facial sponge.</li>
            <li> I have been having pore issues and slight break outs recently.</li>
            <li> and this product helped the problem, but only slightly.</li>
            <li> I also notice that my pores seem a bit smaller and there are less blackheads.</li>
            <li> Black and coarse.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Freeman&#x27;s Charcoal &amp; Black Sugar is an essential within my beauty ritual</li>
            <li> , I am often told I look no older than 30-32...</li>
            <li> I usually let in soak in for a few minutes, then I start scrubbing gently.</li>
            <li> As with all facial products, my skin tends to slightly break-out (just one blemish) after I use, but I think with time it will get used to and stop.  </li>
            <li> Well, unfortunately, I didn&#x27;t get as lucky...</li>
            <li> To start out, my skin is very pale and sensitive.</li>
            <li> Also very dry.</li>
            <li> The sugar polish bits kept falling off my face and created a big mess.</li>
            <li> It can be extremely irritating because the grain is so large</li>
            <li> When I hopped into the shower to wash it off, the mask was still sticky and I started massaging it into my face, adding only a little water at a time.</li>
            <li> being said, I wouldn&#x27;t use it every day and if I scrub too vigorously, my cheeks do get a little red.</li>
            <li> just a little (I left my face damp)</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t though, it left my face feeling cleaning and even faded out my blackheads a little.</li>
            <li> But, I have now noticed that my face is starting to break out a little bit.</li>
            <li> Obviously it wasn&#x27;t harmful, but I applied a little water to my face and neck and just sort of massaged it into or onto the skin&#x27;s surface for about 2 minutes.</li>
            <li> Freeman&#x27;s Charcoal &amp; Black Sugar polishing mask is different from any other mask I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> Charcoal in skin care products is beneficial because when it left on the surface of skin, it pulls oil from the inner part of the pore(which is hard to do without STRIPING the oil from the pore).</li>
            <li> Before I used it on my face, I tried a little on my hand to make sure I wouldn&#x27;t have a weird reaction (I have crazy sensitive skin) and not only was the back of my hand</li>
            <li> I like it, but don&#x27;t buy this if you have sensitive or delicate skin.</li>
            <li> Not really a fan.  </li>
            <li> I would not recommend this product for the face as I believe it is too harsh for facial skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I would also like to add that this stuff works WONDERS for thigh darkening and for rough elbows and knees.</li>
            <li> you slower people it stays wet, it is a mask not a peel off or drying mask.</li>
            <li> but once you put it on your face, that should be a bit wet, it gets thinner because the water seems to dissolve it.</li>
            <li> This mask did not harden in that time, it only slightly dried out.</li>
            <li> this product was beyond rough and sticky.</li>
            <li> THIS IS A ROUGH SCRUB BE CAREFUL.</li>
            <li> leave your face wet but not dripping</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s a bit rough</li>
            <li> I use it a few times a week and daily on zits to make them surface and go away faster.</li>
            <li> A bit rough</li>
            <li> It was exactly as I expected.</li>
            <li> Then once in the shower, I wet my hands and scrub for 2 minutes or so.</li>
            <li> In my humble opinion,  one needs at minimum of two of those things to get an actual bead on how well the product works.</li>
            <li> Takes care of dead skin and red spots diminish.</li>
            <li> It never really cleansed my skin.  </li>
            <li> This product helped get rid of my dead skin around my nose and cheeks, also I noticed a big reducing of the oily skin I keep getting.</li>
            <li> However, a few days ago I took it a bit too far and accidentally/purposely (will explain) went against the recommended leave-on time and left the mask on my face for at least 20-35 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It definitely removes a layer of dead skin.  </li>
            <li> I remove with a wet face cloth and I am done.  </li>
            <li> I have some old thin scars from a car accident when I was a teen, and some genetic skin discoloration toward my hairline, and have been doing TCA &amp; Lactic acid peels @</li>
            <li> But I still kind of hate</li>
            <li> I suggest a face- steam before bed, followed by this mask for 30min to an hour (no longer or will will dry you out!!)</li>
            <li> and it was a very weird but pleasant experience since i&#x27;ve never experienced that with a mask before.</li>
            <li> I found this scrub while I was at winco (weird right?)</li>
            <li> It looks like black sugar paste but feels super oily when applying it and suffocating.</li>
            <li> It is a scrub so it goes on thick and it hard to handle at first.</li>
            <li> It made my skin so incredibly soft and subtle.</li>
            <li> but a little bit goes a long way</li>
            <li> But the sugar grains are so large, so harsh and slow to dissipate that its like taking sandpaper to your skin!</li>
            <li> so it doesn&#x27;t make your face feel dry and tight.</li>
            <li> Also, unlike other charcoal masks I read about that can temporarily stain your skin, this doesn&#x27;t do that because of, I think,</li>
            <li> Adding it to the face routine, replacing my other weekly mask product.</li>
            <li> The past year especially, I have literally been at war with my skin.</li>
            <li> So with that I could already feel that i&#x27;ll be using this all the time because it&#x27;s unlike any other exfoliators i&#x27;ve used</li>
            <li> I was pretty skeptical until I used it for a week.</li>
            <li> I only bought a small sample size</li>
            <li> I use every other day.</li>
            <li> I think I still prefer it because it seems to have a higher concentration of activated charcoal and none of the weird chemicals.</li>
            <li> It was difficult to spread at first without clumps of blackened sugar falling all over, and trying to get the product evenly on your face is not going to happen.</li>
            <li> The sugar draws moisture to the surface of the skin while the charcoal helps draw out dirt, grime, and other impurities.</li>
            <li> ~ my stores only have the small sample style packs.</li>
            <li> I usually let this mask stay on my face for longer than a traditional mask as well.</li>
            <li> I only bought a small sample size</li>
            <li> I found that it left a greasy residue behind that can only be removed by washing my face with a clarifying cleanser.</li>
            <li> This would probably be too harsh on dry skin</li>
            <li> the sugar removes dead dry skin</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t use this everyday, obvi, or it will dry out your skin.</li>
            <li> I can see how people with very sensitive skin would react poorly to it.  </li>
            <li> Try it - I can hardly wait to try some other Freeman Facial products!</li>
            <li> I like that you can leave it on for a long time or a little time or just use as face wash!</li>
            <li> I felt the warming sensation and noticed my skin was a little pink, but</li>
            <li> The pores on my nose are medium sized and the texture can feel a little rough, so having a product like this to make it look</li>
            <li> my only compliant is the scrub is a bit hard to spread around (it tends to clump up. )</li>
            <li> My only complaint is the lid wont close all the way.</li>
            <li> This is a poor copy of Dark Angels from Lush.  </li>
            <li> a love hate relationship.</li>
            <li> Your face is definitely a little dry afterwards because this gets EVERY bit of your dead skin cells while simultaneously suckling up all the oil.</li>
            <li> It’s not very comfortable to remove either, as the sugar is quite abrasive.  </li>
            <li> and I notice when he use this product it tend to keep the pimple down.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t try to layer it, it WILL fall down your shirt, get into your hair and become sticky grainy bits all over your sink.</li>
            <li> I have oily skin, dirt is always trapped in my pores which leaves my skin so dull especially with make up.  </li>
            <li> It was sort of hard to put it on at the beginning since it&#x27;s thick and scrub, but once washing it off my skin had never felt so soft and polished before.</li>
            <li> Comes out black, but once you spread it out and rub it in</li>
            <li> I bought this because of the black charcoal.</li>
            <li> and it was odd because I do not have an oily face.</li>
            <li> I have less zits</li>
            <li> The 1st time I tried it was too odd.</li>
            <li> My skin seems to get less oily as the day progresses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> any slight blemishes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> I was apprehensive about the black sugar and was worried it would clog my pores.</li>
            <li> As for blackheads I could see less on my nose.</li>
            <li> What used to be congested, seriously blemished, with lots of hyper pigmentation and scarring, was left looking smoother, brighter, cleaner, and like porcelain.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s oddly soothing.</li>
            <li> I have noticed less blackheads and pimples.</li>
            <li> and I did notice a slight warming sensation.</li>
            <li> After drying my face I noticed a substantial difference in the amount of black heads on my nose and chin, as well as my coloring.  </li>
            <li> I got it for less than 1/2 the Amazon price at WM, after trying it in the &amp;#34;wee</li>
            <li> had to stop using Freeman Charcoal &amp; black Sugar scrub less than a week after I began because of two reasons.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure anyone else has this problem, but I apply a small amount to my upper lip and when I breathe out of my nose</li>
            <li> Black clumps of goo got all over the vanity and sink.</li>
            <li> What used to be congested, seriously blemished, with lots of hyper pigmentation and scarring, was left looking smoother, brighter, cleaner, and like porcelain.</li>
            <li> I agree with other reviewers who indicated this process can be a little messy (hence, 4 stars)</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have a problem with much mess .</li>
            <li> You can use something else but replenish your faces moisture or expect a tight face.</li>
            <li> It arrived on time, tightly sealed in package.  </li>
            <li> Personally, I have sensitive oily skin and have to be very careful with what I put on my face to avoid rashes, bad reactions or break outs.</li>
            <li> The first time I used this product, I had horribly rough skin(repairing from a bad sunburn).</li>
            <li> I felt the black sugar rubbing away my dead skin on my face.</li>
            <li> The black sugar part of the product is what is going to scrub away the dead skin.</li>
            <li> It works on dry skin, dull skin, dead skin, and eczema.</li>
            <li> Added instructions: When rubbing the product in lean your head over the sink because little globs of sugar will fall off your face.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the results didn&#x27;t last very long, but that&#x27;s understandable</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the results didn&#x27;t last very long, but that&#x27;s understandable</li>
            <li> My skin felt really soft and my winter dried hands were soft to the extent that there was no more dried, painful skin om my hands and fingers.</li>
            <li> My face always breaks out bad and it always takes forever to go away but with this stuff it only takes like 3 or 4 days to clear my skin again and its moisturizer</li>
            <li> the day&#x27;s grim and dead skin was all sloughed off, leaving a nice finish.  </li>
            <li> When my face feels really dirty , this stuff cleans very well</li>
            <li> but, if you have oily skin, this might actually make it worse.</li>
            <li> I use it once a week since I wear heavy makeup for work.</li>
            <li> I scrub it all over and then let it sit for a few minutes to let the charcoal do</li>
            <li> Every few minutes I rubbed it around so the sugar could do</li>
            <li> maybe I&#x27;m just unfortunate and it didn&#x27;t work well for my skin, but I have never considered my skin sensitive</li>
            <li> I would maybe do this mask every few weeks or so.</li>
            <li> This is a heavy duty scrub.</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve noticed after using it a few times.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday in the shower as my face wash</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always skeptical about face cleansers and masks because my face is so sensitive that it can just have a reaction to anything</li>
            <li> (it&#x27;s not as heavy as olive oil at all)</li>
            <li> Putting face lotion doesn&#x27;t help either because the dead skin residue is still on your face</li>
            <li> I am a connoisseur of facial masks (twice a week), but I have never experienced any product that has made my blackhead prone skin feel like silk.</li>
            <li> you can just leave it on your face a few minutes</li>
            <li> Use this product a few times a week</li>
            <li> Thankfully it didn&#x27;t, but still, I did not enjoy using this mask.</li>
            <li> Messy.</li>
            <li> For once, I missed the review that said it was grainy/sugary and messy.  </li>
            <li> The sugar is harsh on the skin and the end result was just to redden my face.</li>
            <li> With my hands, I slowly get a part of my face wet and start rinsing/washing/exfoliating with the sugar.</li>
            <li> So messy to use.</li>
            <li> If that is why you are looking at this product, look elsewhere as there is very little black charcoal here.  </li>
            <li> I have pale skin that leans toward rosacea.</li>
            <li> there was no easy feat.</li>
            <li> I am in my late 30&#x27;s an notice a few black heads or build up in my pores</li>
            <li> The consistency was a little gritty making the product difficult to remove.</li>
            <li> I typically have a little redness to my skin and there was no redness at all!!</li>
            <li> I put a very thin layer (as thin as possible, no caking here) of this mixture on as makeup...just enough to even out skin tone and hide</li>
            <li> But be careful if you scrub too hard it may cause irritation!</li>
            <li> decided to only use this on my hands and feet before showering, but am a little disappointed that I couldn&#x27;t continue to use it as a facial mask.</li>
            <li> its a little hard to apply to your face because its like a gel scrub almost.</li>
            <li> Sugar scrub with very little charcoal.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also started using it on those annoying little red bumps on my upper arms</li>
            <li> I like it as a scrub but bought it because I was looking for something similar to origins expensive Charcoal mask.</li>
            <li> This one cause I usually apply when Im in the shower..</li>
            <li> okay this mask is insane.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s suppose to do that</li>
            <li> not sure I like this.</li>
            <li> I usually get.</li>
            <li> , I do a minimum of 10, usually longer because I end up distracted reading the internet.</li>
            <li> This mask clears up the blackheads overnight, and the cystic acne in a few day!</li>
            <li> applied the mask as I usually would and decided that I would leave it on a bit longer this time.</li>
            <li> I have trouble with my skin and this mask is a godsend for me!</li>
            <li> I usually use it just as a scrub.</li>
            <li> At this point I was getting really anxious about how my face looked.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I use this product about twice a week to get all the dead skin off my face because I have random dry patches, and it always does the trick.</li>
            <li> Very messy</li>
            <li> exfoliating products i&#x27;ve encountered only contain those tiny color beads that don&#x27;t do crap for me.</li>
            <li> It warms SLIGHTLY (VERY slightly!)</li>
            <li> very messy.. again, not a mask at all.. and hard to close after using since the sugar is clogging the opening</li>
            <li> The skin on my face is always dry and flaky and I get random breakouts...</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a little difficult to apply, it&#x27;s basically just globs of thick black sugar.</li>
            <li> It never got hard like a mask,  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit hard to apply since it&#x27;s think and chunky in texture but the trick is to spread it by patting it not by smothering it everywhere.</li>
            <li> And I had a bit of a hard time applying all over my face because of the sugar i guess.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s hard for me to find something that won&#x27;t irritate my skin</li>
            <li> I rub it onto my face, I try not to scrub too hard because I&#x27;ve noticed that my face turns pinkish at the end if I do</li>
            <li> The sugary goop is hard to apply in a neat fashion and it tends to slide around and off.  </li>
            <li> It is really hard to spread it over your face because of the texture.</li>
            <li> Hard to use if you&#x27;re expecting a dense, creamy mask.</li>
            <li> I took a star off because it is really hard to spread onto your face -</li>
            <li> I have really bad skin and suffer from hormonal acne as an adult.</li>
            <li> Obviously this product isn&#x27;t minty but my pores feel as if they are breathing or cold wind is coming into contact with them.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s clumsy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I smeared this on thick and watched TV for a bit.</li>
            <li> Although it is advertised as a mask, it does not have as thick of a consistency as you would expect.</li>
            <li> I was really hoping to like this mask, but i hate it.</li>
            <li> I mean nothing makes my face soooooooo  </li>
            <li> I will no longer go back to expensive mud mask products!</li>
            <li> I mean, my skin is SO SOFT.&lt;br /&gt;That</li>
            <li> one last thing I&#x27;ll add is I hate the feeling of my skin feeling tight</li>
            <li> and i seriously glow after i use this scrub</li>
            <li> I did notice, about an hour after getting out of the shower and using this mask, that the sides of my nose, my chin, and my T zone were slightly oily, which is uncomfortable</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m seriously amazed by it.</li>
            <li> Seriously.</li>
            <li> Excuse my silly captions, I took the photos off of my snapchat!</li>
            <li> usually use it when I shower because then I won&#x27;t have to be afraid of getting it on my clothes and making black smudges on them.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is a little difficult to put on</li>
            <li> I feel bad for neglecting my skin for the last year.</li>
            <li> It is difficult to apply evenly, leaves clumps and would be a bit messy if applied to the neck.  </li>
            <li> Otherwise, it could be a sticky, messy and difficult experience.</li>
            <li> Or at least I can!</li>
            <li> May work for those with tough skin but guess I will use it on my feet.</li>
            <li> I would give this four stars, but it came with the lid broken.</li>
            <li> ...burned way worse than any face mask that I&#x27;ve ever used...</li>
            <li> I have sensitve skin and have no experienced any issues with this item.</li>
            <li> It felt thin and I couldn&#x27;t help but want to wash it off.</li>
            <li> so  you&#x27;re just making them stick on your face which makes matters worse.</li>
            <li> The burning/stinging feeling was still irritating my skin even after I washed it off, and while I went to bed (after I used my Palmer&#x27;s face oil, it soothed the stinging a bit</li>
            <li> Seriously, buy this stuff!</li>
            <li> Very subtle.  </li>
            <li> The burning never subsided and actually got so bad to the point where I had to get up, rush to my sink, and immediately rinse the mask off my face while (almost painfully) exfoliating and rubbing the sugar off.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t do anything for my skin unfortunately.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s weird, but it works well.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t spend your money on expensive facials just try once</li>
            <li> just know when you put it in it will appear faint</li>
            <li> I know some people like how that feels, but I think it&#x27;s weird and uncomfortable.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is literally the worst facial mask I have ever used!</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not nearly as impressed with this as I thought I would be.</li>
            <li> nothing uncomfortable.  </li>
            <li> but with a weird aftertaste.</li>
            <li> Having had a devastating attack of eczema in recent months, I have been buying a lot of products to get eczema under control.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li> feels weird while on</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m obsessed with this stuff.</li>
            <li> The texture is weird because it doesn&#x27;t spread out evenly</li>
            <li> Do not use a light-colored washcloth when rinsing the product off; wet charcoal leaves horrible stains.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so crazy about this stuff, I tell everyone about it..</li>
            <li> So tonight I was desperate</li>
            <li> Sounds crazy..</li>
            <li> My skin has crazy reactions to a lot of things and didn&#x27;t have any problem with this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I do the rest of my shower routine, and when I am done, I rinse again with cold water.</li>
            <li> The consistency makes it really awkward to use.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be sorry you tried this stuff!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Guess it&#x27;s over exaggerated!</li>
            <li> They were quite bad in fact.</li>
            <li> I am SHOCKED at the results I saw from using this mask.</li>

            <li> no burning or itching or uncomfortable feeling!!</li>
            <li> Yes, it&#x27;s weird and clumpy, but it&#x27;s sugar!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> Not really a fan.  This cleanses really nice, but very abrasive on skin, and it goes on patchy  not smooth for a mask.  Will use it just for cleansing. For an scrub cleanser I prefer Nuetrogena grapefruit acne wash.  Much gentler on skin.  Should of bought the Bior Mask 1 minute heating.  Probably a great stuff just not what I was looking for.  Seller quick and undamaged.</li>
            <li> Love the way it makes my skin look! I like that you can leave it on for a long time or a little time or just use as face wash!</li>
            <li> my face loves this product.</li>
            <li> Love this scrub! Gets all the dead skin off and leaves my skin feeling soft.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this mask 3 times now since ordering it. It smells great and leaves my skin super soft! Comes out black, but once you spread it out and rub it in it&#x27;s pretty transparent. Love it!</li>
            <li> This seemed to actually cause me to break out..didn&#x27;t do anything for my skin unfortunately.</li>
            <li> Love love love.  Right when you put it on its nice and warm. Skin feels smooth and renew</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had my fair share of using facial washes. You name it, I tried it. This has to be the best one I&#x27;ve used. Charcoal facial wash is one of the coolest revelations in the industry of facial care.</li>
            <li> This mask is a bit messy but I like the warming effect and how clean my skin feels afterwards.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this mask twice and have fallen in love with it. The sugar makes it smell sweet and it does what it says it will.&lt;br /&gt;Tips - Use after shower or have a damp warm face so your pores are as open as possible. Many people comment on the crumbly  mess and roughness of the sugar bits; Just apply small amounts and remember the skin on your face is naturally sensitive so with anything you apply to your face: slowly and SOFTLY!  Lastly, follow the time suggestions the bottle gives you and don&#x27;t skip the actual massaging of the scrub. You can&#x27;t expect it to work if you don&#x27;t follow directions.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!!! I have VERY oily and sensitive skin, and have tried just about everything from scrubs, peels, masks, wipes, and prescriptions. most of them either dry my skin out, cause redness, and flaking/peeling while other did nothing to help. after two day my skin is visibly cleaner, noticeably less oily, my skin is soft, and is clearing up. my only compliant is the scrub is a bit hard to spread around (it tends to clump up. ) but other than that I love it I will definitely buy again and DEFINATELY recommend it.</li>
            <li> A friend let my daughter use this at college.  Once she found out how much she liked it she begged me to buy her a tube of her own.</li>
            <li> Wish it had been called &amp;#34;scrub&amp;#34; rather than &amp;#34;mask.&amp;#34; I think it is great as a scrub, but it does not stick to my face like I would expect of a coal mask, definitely more on the sugar side.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t experience the same overwhelming results that others are describing. I use other Freeman products that I enjoy much more. I won&#x27;t purchase this again.</li>
            <li> my skin feel so good after using this. you first pad it on, let it sit, then massage it around your face and rinse</li>
            <li> This is sugar suspended in glycerin. The amount of charcoal is negligible. It never got hard like a mask,  it is actually a nice moisturizing sugar scrub.  I like it as a scrub but bought it because I was looking for something similar to origins expensive Charcoal mask.</li>
            <li> I feel likes it&#x27;s Break me out I&#x27;m sticking to apricot scrub instead</li>
            <li> As others have written, this is more of a scrub than a mask - except they want you to leave it on 5 minutes and then massage into your face for another 1-2. I bought this because of the black charcoal. If that is why you are looking at this product, look elsewhere as there is very little black charcoal here.  I prefer my Healing Tree black charcoal soap and PureSol Bamboo charcoal konjac facial sponge. They do the job without the abrasiveness of this product.  I would not recommend this product for the face as I believe it is too harsh for facial skin. I wasn&#x27;t able to make it more than about 45 seconds when trying to gently massage my face - the sugar crystals are too large, sharp,  and painful. I am sure with the right magnification you could see the damage you are doing. Exfoliation does not require abrasion. May work for those with tough skin but guess I will use it on my feet.</li>
            <li> My granddaughter loves this and I purchase it for her regularly, but not via Amazon.  Although I am a regular customer of Amazon, why would anyone pay $9.99 when you can buy directly from Freeman Beauty&#x27;s website for $3.99 each? Just sayin&#x27;</li>
            <li> This was just my experience but, if you have oily skin, this might actually make it worse. I found that it left a greasy residue behind that can only be removed by washing my face with a clarifying cleanser. I think this would be better suited for dry skin types. Didn&#x27;t like the greasy feel after rinsing it off.  As a note, I have combination skin. This may work for others, it just didn&#x27;t for me. Hope this helps.</li>
            <li> Great product. Makes your skin soft</li>
            <li> I love this scrub, I it scours off dry spots while still being gentle and I feel as if the charcoal purifies pores&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m acne prone and this stuff is great- I also like to use it as a scrub before shaving legs</li>
            <li> I think this is overpriced, but it is pretty good. It leaves your face smooth. I don&#x27;t have acne, so I can&#x27;t attest to it&#x27;s detox effects. It does feel good, though.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. I use it once a week since I wear heavy makeup for work. It keeps my skin very soft and clean, i no longer have breakouts and my skin stays very even and just has a natural glow to it when I&#x27;m not wearing makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would also like to add that this stuff works WONDERS for thigh darkening and for rough elbows and knees. Just apply the same way you would to your face.</li>
            <li> I would classify this more like a &amp;#34;scrub&amp;#34; than a &amp;#34;mask&amp;#34; because of its grainy consistency.  It is difficult to apply evenly, leaves clumps and would be a bit messy if applied to the neck.  I don&#x27;t feel any particular sensation after leaving it on for the recommended time, but once scrubbed off, my skin DOES feel super smooth and soft.  I&#x27;m not really convinced that the charcoal is truly an &amp;#34;active&amp;#34; ingredient that draws impurities out of the skin, but more that the grainy paste exfoliates the upper layers of the skin.  I think there might be a better charcoal mask out there.</li>
            <li> I ordered three Freeman facial masks at the same time and when they arrived, this one was my least favorite, but now that I&#x27;ve learned how to use it, I LOVE it!  Don&#x27;t expect it to go on smooth like a clay mask would.  The trick is that you need to splash a little water on your face first and then apply and scrub.  I scrub it all over and then let it sit for a few minutes to let the charcoal do it&#x27;s thing.  Then rinse off.  My face feels so smooth afterward.  I have very oily, acne prone skin that really responds well to exfoliation,  but if you have sensitive skin, this might be too &amp;#34;scrubby&amp;#34; for you.</li>
            <li> I personally could not use this as a mask. The sugar polish bits kept falling off my face and created a big mess. I would use this maybe as an exfoliant and rinse off immediately. However, it left an oil residue on the face that I didn&#x27;t care for. Probably will never repurchase.</li>
            <li> I bought this thinking it would be good... My face started burning and i had a blister on my forehead!!! Now my whole forehead is peeling.  Wont buy again!!</li>
            <li> I really liked to use this as a scrub, I didn&#x27;t seem much benefit from trying to use it as a mask. Smells lovely!</li>
            <li> Pure and natural!&lt;br /&gt;Maybe tasty.</li>
            <li> Great, great product.  Anything with charcoal affects the friendly flora of the facial skin so don&#x27;t hesitate; this item is fantastic!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. Feels warm going on. Face feels clean after. I&#x27;ll be buying more.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! Your face is definitely a little dry afterwards because this gets EVERY bit of your dead skin cells while simultaneously suckling up all the oil. My advice. Moisturize afterwards. I use st. Ives. You can use something else but replenish your faces moisture or expect a tight face. Definitely does the job, though!</li>
            <li> I would give this four stars, but it came with the lid broken. I have to keep it taped shut. I love it the scrub. As others have mentioned it is more like a scrub than a mask.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves this product!</li>
            <li> Plays music very clear and loud, fits better than Apple earbuds and not as expensive.</li>
            <li> More of a scrub then a mask</li>
            <li> Been using this product for a long time now. The skin on my face is always dry and flaky and I get random breakouts...well, not so much now. I used this scrub 3-4 times a week and it leaves me skin so soft and clean. I rarely get pimples and it has helped reduce the number of blackheads on my nose and cheeks. It&#x27;s abrasive but gentle and unlike scrubs that used ground nut shells and other coarse ingredients, the sugar will not clog your pores because it melts. I used to use a popular apricot scrub and the small granules would get stuck in my pores. No bueno. I also have very sensitive skin because I&#x27;m a red head and not once has this product irritated my skin.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many exfoliaters in my life. I even have the renewal advanced cleansing system with the brush.. But nothing..I mean nothing makes my face soooooooo  soft and flawless looking like this stuff! Like starting all over!  I started using this on my hands as well. It makes them so youthful! spanking brand new!  What else can I say?  I love this stuff soooo much! Freeman this is a product you should never stop making...Ever!  I&#x27;m 41 and this is something that makes me feel beautiful. You have all the other masks available at the stores can we please have lots of these going out everywhere? Like Walmart, ect.. PLEASE! Ladies I&#x27;m so crazy about this stuff, I tell everyone about it..</li>
            <li> best scrub i have used and gives me such a bright complexion im brown skin and i seriously glow after i use this scrub and i have no problem with breakouts with this</li>
            <li> THE best &amp;  mostly ALL natural !! I&#x27;ll never buy the more expensive brands again ! This can be used as to exfoliate  &amp;/or mask ! Has wonderful ingredients ! The only thing that could be not natural would be fragrance....</li>
            <li> I actually bought this product at my local Rite-Aid for a little over $3 and I love it!! My skin glows afterwards and is really soft.</li>
            <li> This is cool. When you scrub on your face, it heats up and gets really warm, it&#x27;s so neat. feels good and i feel fresh and clean after.</li>
            <li> This is pretty graphic, but I have to say.. this stuff rocks. After the first use my face looked like a playdough fun factory. Blackheads had been hiding away for who knows how long, came sliding right out. It was disgustingly satisfying. Also, my face feels like a baby&#x27;s butt after I use it.</li>
            <li> My fav so far ! Can see a difference after first use</li>
            <li> Its good , keeps away the whit heads and isn&#x27;t too harsh on my face and neck.</li>
            <li> I feel bad for neglecting my skin for the last year. I&#x27;ve been using for the last week and already can see and feel the difference.</li>
            <li> Works really great and my face is so smooth after washing it off</li>
            <li> This is my absolute go to face mask/scrub whenever my pores are a tad too noticeable. I have oily acne prone skin with lots of scarring and find that this product is great at making my skin feel less of an oil spill and smoother.  It smells like a dream. It&#x27;s a bit hard to apply since it&#x27;s think and chunky in texture but the trick is to spread it by patting it not by smothering it everywhere. Somehow I have a feeling this also helps with reducing pigmentation of my scars over time too.</li>
            <li> Leaves your skin so soft!</li>
            <li> Love this mask. I put it on and took a bubble bath. Every few minutes I rubbed it around so the sugar could do it&#x27;s job. I left it on for a total of 10 min. My face felt so soft and fresh after!! Best part...no burning or itching or uncomfortable feeling!! This is the only mask I&#x27;ve tried that made a visible change after the first use! Get this!</li>
            <li> I was interested in trying this as a low-cost alternative to active charcoal masks found in high-end beauty stores, like Sephora.  I read that charcoal masks were really good to control acne, so wanted to give charcoal a go.  After hunting through six different stores in one evening, I finally found it locally at Bed, Bath and Beyond.  I also have previously used Freeman masks and liked them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This mask is way different than any other clay type mask, more like a thick, oozy sugar scrub that sits on your face.  It doesn&#x27;t dry like clay masks do.  It doesn&#x27;t harden like peels.  It heats up and draws out impurities -- in fact, the mask heats up FAST and gets very warm.  This is the warmest mask I have ever used.  Kind of intense.  I can see how people with very sensitive skin would react poorly to it.  I&#x27;m slightly sensitive and while I enjoyed the heat, I also didn&#x27;t want to overdo it and let it sit for only 7 minutes before moving on to the scrubbing in part -- did that for only about a minute and rinsed it off.  To remove the mask I use a face sponge, I think this made it easier to wipe/pull the mask off.  Avoid the eye area when applying and scrubbing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would rather this had been a clay-mask then the consistency of this mask, but that&#x27;s a personal preference.  The charcoal benefit works very well and the sugar scrub is an added bonus as a two-in-one product.  Also, unlike other charcoal masks I read about that can temporarily stain your skin, this doesn&#x27;t do that because of, I think, the suspension of the sugar scrub.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I applied this with a large fan paint brush, the same type of brush I use applying clay masks. It was easy to apply with the fan brush, I just squeezed out some on the brush, then carefully applied it to a section my face at a time.  I think this is the way to go with this item so you don&#x27;t rub the scrub in prematurely, and it won&#x27;t drip down/off your face or fingers. I applied a medium/light covering:  Enough to spread/pat out the mask, but also was okay with a few spots of skin tone peeking through here and there under lighter-coated spots. Another reviewer commented about keeping a towel in her lap, so I did that just in case.  Though it kind of &#x27;shifted&#x27; a little, it wasn&#x27;t gooey enough to have drips fall into my lap, or on my clothes etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the mask my face felt squeaky clean and super soft.  Normally squeaky clean &#x3D; dry and tight.  Not the case with this mask. Just clean and soft. I didn&#x27;t see any life shattering changes in the look of my face as I don&#x27;t have tons of blackheads since I have been working on clearing up my skin for a couple of months now.  But it definitely felt/looked really clean, oil free and the day&#x27;s grim and dead skin was all sloughed off, leaving a nice finish.  Will definitely add this to my weekly face scrub if I don&#x27;t break out from it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;AFTERCARE:  I recommend applying some sort of light, oil-free moisturizer to ensure that your face doesn&#x27;t get too dry and then flake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line:  Great experience with it.  Met my expectations.  Adding it to the face routine, replacing my other weekly mask product.</li>
            <li> Had this for about three weeks and I love it. My skin always look brighter after using it. I follow the instructions exactly and it works great for me. I scrub twice a week only and it&#x27;s helped my skin tons! I have combo/oily skin btw. Will purchase again, but probably in store where it&#x27;ll be cheaper. lol. So glad I found this! Will be be my go to mask for exfoliating!</li>
            <li> I bought this at cvs once and liked it, this was the same one. Very refreshing on my skin.</li>
            <li> Makes skin smooth! My cheeks are sensitive so I avoid them when scrubbing. But still a great product</li>
            <li> I tried it. Wasn&#x27;t what I was expecting. Thought it would at least go on smoothly like a mask even though it&#x27;s grainy, but it was almost like putting wet sugar on my face and letting it sit there. It was hard to distribute making me use alot more then intended. It works great as a scrub but I wouldn&#x27;t really call it a mask.</li>
            <li> smells like perfume and has a strange consistency. did not feel any detoxifying effects.</li>
            <li> I like this product for clarifying and exfoliating. The directions say to use it as a mask, just don&#x27;t. It doesn&#x27;t spread evenly enough for that. It is the texture of of a body scrub. Works well for the price</li>
            <li> Okay, I read a lot of really good reviews and was super excited to try this out for myself.  Could there really be a product THIS INEXPENSIVE that worked as everyone said it would?!  Well, unfortunately, I didn&#x27;t get as lucky...instead, it burned when I scrubbed my face with it...burned way worse than any face mask that I&#x27;ve ever used...maybe I&#x27;m just unfortunate and it didn&#x27;t work well for my skin, but I have never considered my skin sensitive and I very rarely have any difficulties with skincare products irritating my skin.  But, I just wanted to put it out there - while many people have great things to say about this (and maybe you will too!), it just did not work for me.</li>
            <li> Very messy and I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s that great at cleansing blackheads......it ok for a scrub, but nothing special in my opinion!</li>
            <li> As soon as I put this stuff on I felt the black sugar rubbing away my dead skin on my face. I leave it on for the recommended time and I use it about three times a week and my face always feels so amazing afterwards. I didn&#x27;t have high expectations for this at all. But it is a wonderful product.</li>
            <li> I love this scrub it has a nice light scent and is very &amp;#34;scrubby&amp;#34;. It even has a self warming effect on my skin that i like as well.</li>
            <li> I use this mask as an exfoliator. It&#x27;s pretty gentle and doesn&#x27;t strip my skin. Lush Dark Angels charcoal scrub is very similar.</li>
            <li> I love this mask. It leave my face super soft and smooth. My only complaint is the lid wont close all the way.</li>
            <li> Love this item. It&#x27;s weird, but it works well. My face and neck are smooth. Left it on for 10 minutes, scrubbed for 2 minutes and had an ultra soft face. Will be ordering more of this product.</li>
            <li> I had purchased the small sample packet awhile back, and liked it so much, I had to order a bottle. It really does help with clearing out impurities. Your face will feel a bit dry afterward, but some facial lotion will quickly fix that.</li>
            <li> Feels good, makes my skin glow! I even use it as a daily shower scrub sometimes. Love the heat activation, wish I could find it in stores near me!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!! Leaves my skin soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> This is not a facial mask. I would classify it as a sugar scrub. Thus I give it 3 stars for the miss representation. However, the product is luscious. Great exfoliation and wonderful smell. Just nothing like a facial mask. Overall a wonderful smelling sugar scrub.</li>
            <li> Love love this mask. Leaves me face feeling refreshed.</li>
            <li> Really rough, with large crystals. Exfoliates well but is just not sensitive enough for my skin.</li>
            <li> It does live you with an amazing clean smooth skin, I usually use it once a week and let it sit for about 15 mins then rinse off</li>
            <li> I like it, but don&#x27;t buy this if you have sensitive or delicate skin. The sugar is very coarse and hurts a bit when you rub it in.</li>
            <li> Great value and leaves my skin soft. Plus it smells great while it is on.</li>
            <li> I love it......  that&#x27;s all I can say,,,,</li>
            <li> A great product at a great price! I use this product and my skin felt so clean and fresh! It&#x27;s a little messy, but it is worth it! I use it twice a week usually during my shower so I can rinse it off so much easier! Great product! Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s kind of a burny tingle when u put it on, I like though. Hours after rinsing and being out in about my face feels moisturized but not oily; I have notoriously dry skin. I have been having pore issues and slight break outs recently. I think my pores got smaller. I might raise it to 5 starts later.</li>
            <li> My face always breaks out bad and it always takes forever to go away but with this stuff it only takes like 3 or 4 days to clear my skin again and its moisturizer so it doesn&#x27;t make your face feel dry and tight.</li>
            <li> Giving 4 stars because it goes on kind of weird at first. Love that it gets warm when it&#x27;s on. Smells great also</li>
            <li> I thought it was a face mask but its more of a face scrub .. over all 4 stars cus it is pretty good ...</li>
            <li> This scrub is wonderful for exfoliating. My skin is left looking healthy and refreshed. I have been buying more expensive products and I am glad I happened upon the charcoal and black sugar scrub. This is much more cost efficient and works better than any other exfoliation product I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;I have not yet used it daily but every other day. The softness and \\&quot;clean\\&quot; feeling lasts for quite a long time. I would definitely recommend the black sugar and charcoal scrub to anyone looking to take better care of their skin.&lt;br /&gt;The warming sensation is a nice surprise as it feels nice. I would suggest putting quarter size amounts on spreading and repeating, until you cover your face. The texture of the scrub is easily put on this way.</li>
            <li> Charcoal face masks have been hyped up a lot on social media so I was interested in trying it out. This is a great product and I will be adding it to my weekly routine. When you spread it on it heats up nicely. When you rinse it off, it leaves your skin soft and brightened and smelling good. I&#x27;m looking forward to seeing the long term effects. I would&#x27;ve rated it 5 stars but saw the same product at a drug store today for the same product but 2-1 deal which kind of bummed me out.</li>
            <li> The consistency was a little gritty making the product difficult to remove. Apart from that it&#x27;s great it made my skin feel very smooth and made my moisturizer more effective.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s rather hard to apply because you can&#x27;t really rub it into your skin without it feeling rough, you have to pat it on. Really good though, as soon as i take it off the zit that i developed during the day because of my sweaty bangs becomes the size of a pin and all redness is gone. Lovely and refreshing. If this is something you want to have for a while i recommend buying two which will last longer!</li>
            <li> Love this face scrub! I immediately felt like my face was clean and it made my face feel super smooth, too.  The smell was pleasant. Highly recommend especially for the price.</li>
            <li> I like this mask a lot. It feels so nice when you put it on and it leaves your face feeling great afterwards!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also really recommend the freeman facial charcoal and black sugar mud mask! Absolutely amazing!</li>
            <li> To start out, my skin is very pale and sensitive. I have a UV(sun) allergy; while that is it&#x27;s own problem, it causes a lot of other complications with my skin in the long run. I love Freeman&#x27;s products- they are effective and dirt cheap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For this mask in particular, I have seen many reviews that say it is not a mask, just a scrub. When you first use it, you will understand why it seems that way. But it is a mask as well and should be used as one. Charcoal in skin care products is beneficial because when it left on the surface of skin, it pulls oil from the inner part of the pore(which is hard to do without STRIPING the oil from the pore). So leaving this product on your face for 5-7 minutes like it says to do is a key part of the process. It&#x27;s just not what people are used to in a mask. The black sugar part of the product is what is going to scrub away the dead skin. AND if you left the mask on prior to scrubbing, all the excess oil the charcoal pulled to the surface, the black sugar will remove.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, my funny story! The first time I used this product, I had horribly rough skin(repairing from a bad sunburn). I smeared this on thick and watched TV for a bit. I left it on a lot longer than it says to, but there was no discomfort. It was kind of soothing and warm. When I hopped into the shower to wash it off, the mask was still sticky and I started massaging it into my face, adding only a little water at a time. I put my hands into the water to get a little more and my hands felt so soft it startled me! I choked on some of the mask(which tastes just like sugar...) and washed the rest off. My face was as soft as my hands, and I&#x27;ve never felt such a huge difference in the texture of my skin with just one use of something. I am a firm believer that you need to take care of your skin every day for it to be healthy and beautiful. Nothing works over night, nothing is a miracle potion. Everything takes time because your skin goes through cycles. If youcut yourself, nothing you put on it will heal it right away. It&#x27;s the same for your skin. But this mask/scrub threw me for a loop because it gave me a very significant result with the first use. It&#x27;s kept my skin from overdrying and from getting too oily- a good balance for about 2 days after use. It&#x27;s a great exfoliator, without being harsh. And the prices is beyond reasonable. I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone, it&#x27;s my new favorite mask!</li>
            <li> I think the name can be a bit misleading. Although I do like this product, I think it&#x27;s better to be categorized as an exfoliator. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s necessary to leave on your skin longer than just a couple of minutes. The reason why it works so well is the second process of the two minute of rubbing the product into your skin. I don&#x27;t like how the product feels gooped on my face. Most masks, your face is supposed to feel clean and tight. The product has a nice scent and is affordable. I would maybe do this mask every few weeks or so. I have other masks that I enjoy more than this one but still like the end results after. It does leave your skin soft.</li>
            <li> Finally!! This is one of those products that actually made a difference from the first time I used it. I have tried so many difference face wash brands and types for my super combination skin. I have very shiny, oily skin (but no acne) while at the same time fighting dry flakes in certain areas. Everything I tried, even those cleansers that are meant to be milder on the skin (Basis, Burt&#x27;s Bees), would leave my face feeling dry within minutes. To the point that my moisturizer could not combat it - leaving me with flakes on my oily skin. I only happened to glance at this product on the shelf at my local grocery store, and it was such a great price that I thought, &amp;#34;Why not?&amp;#34;. Oh my goodness. I didn&#x27;t know how wonderful it would feel, that it actually warms for a few seconds after you apply. After I rinsed, I couldn&#x27;t believe that my face was not dry at ALL. Just very smooth and soft. I have not had flakes since the day I first started using this product, about 2 months ago. I am already stocking up on this stuff, I hope they never discontinue it!!</li>
            <li> It instantly brightened my skin</li>
            <li> Omg this is the best thing ever !!! Don&#x27;t spend your money on expensive facials just try once and you will see what I&#x27;m talking about I&#x27;m really really picky with my face I think the face is the first thing you have to take care and I don&#x27;t mind expending money for my face but with this is like Gods gift not expensive and it really works 😍😍😍😍🙌🏻🙏🏻</li>
            <li> I spend a lot of time and money on my skincare routine. I have tried a TON of masks and scrubs. They all have been so so. But I have never tried something that changed my skin so much after one use. It made my skin so incredibly soft and subtle. My pores were smaller. My skin tone looked more even. I have used scrubs in the past that have removed the dead skin from my face for the most part. This mask almost creates new looking skin. It&#x27;s beautiful and I would HIGHLY recommend it. Especially for the price. If you have a Walmart near by, they always have sample packets of the Freeman masks for you to try. However, this price is unbeatable and believe me you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> I love this item! It leaves my face feeling super soft and I like the smell. The only problem I have with it is that the lid doesn&#x27;t close properly because of the sugars.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t call this a mask, it&#x27;s a sugar scrub with charcoal. It&#x27;s sticky and just really wasn&#x27;t what I was looking for. With \\&quot;mask\\&quot; in the name, you&#x27;d think it would dry like a clay mask, it doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> i love this stuff it leaves my face feeling and looking  nice and clear  plus its doesnt smells harsh ..</li>
            <li> Fantastic. Just use as directed and don&#x27;t leave on longer. Learn from my mistake ;)</li>
            <li> I like how this makes my skin feel soft and clean.</li>
            <li> I have used many different apricot scrubs in the past, but I&#x27;m really glad I switched to this sugar scrub; it works so much better; doesn&#x27;t leave my face feeling like it&#x27;s been through the blender.</li>
            <li> This face mask gives you sensation of heat right after apply , it works as soon as you put it on...it has very nice ,fresh smell . Another great face mask...</li>
            <li> I love this polish mask. When I put it on, I feel a warm sensation on my face. It also smells wonderful but not overpowering. I leave the scrub on my face for a few minutes then wash it off with water and at the same time gently exfoliating my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mask leaves my face super soft. I have made this brand part of my skin routine because it leaves positive results.</li>
            <li> Leaves your face feeling fresh &amp; clean. I also used on my hands &amp; soon to use on my feet. The product rubs all the dead skin completely off, and leaves the skin feeling rejuvenated.</li>
            <li> I used this mask tonight and I rarely ever do reviews but felt compelled to write one for this. I have really bad skin and suffer from hormonal acne as an adult. The past year especially, I have literally been at war with my skin. I have tried everything, nothing has ever made much of a difference besides fry or burn out my skin. So tonight I was desperate I have a few new spots that were appearing and also a few areas that just won&#x27;t clear up. I followed the directions exactly and left it on for 7 minutes and then scrubbed for two minutes in the bath. When I got out I could literally feel my skin breathing &amp; was brought to tears. It felt like I had just sloughed off years worth of dirt and debris that had built up over 23 years. Maybe all the harsh products, benzoyl peroxide, proactiv etc were just drying out the top layer of my skin and what I needed was something like this to actually draw out all of the embedded toxins in my skin. I can&#x27;t believe my face feels this clean, it definitely gives my hope for better skin in the future.</li>
            <li> Love it and it seems to have a slight warming effect! Iam a female welder and it cleans my face so good and leaves my skin so soft!!</li>
            <li> I will start off saying what facial scrub you know that heats up a little when its rubbed between your hands with a little water to easily spread this thing. BOOOOM! This one cause I usually apply when Im in the shower..I mean I like this not only because of that feature but because its pretty much true of what it afvertised. Also it leaves my skin with a healthy glow over the course of 24hour and over time reduces the old but very few acne scars I  had.</li>
            <li> I have oily skin, dirt is always trapped in my pores which leaves my skin so dull especially with make up.  I use the Freeman Facial Charcoal &amp; Black Sugar every other day and it leaves my skin so clean and clear.  When applying to face it can be a little messy but the warming sensation is such a good feeling.  I leave the mask on for about 15 minutes, massage thoroughly then rise and moisturize.  Highly recommended!!</li>
            <li> Amazing product gets rid of dry winter skin in one use. Leaves you soft as a baby&#x27;s... Well you know the saying.</li>
            <li> Really nice cleaning product.  Moisture after used.  Love it</li>
            <li> okay this mask is insane. I ordered it 3 days ago and it arrived a week early which is good! and i tried it immediately after i removed all my make up and i just started putting it on my face. It has a really good smell, it&#x27;s kinda hard to explain but it was a sweet scent. And I had a bit of a hard time applying all over my face because of the sugar i guess. It kept on clumping and i can&#x27;t put an even layer but whatever then i left it on for about 7 minutes then i started scrubbing for about a minute or two then i noticed that it felt kinda warm and it was a very weird but pleasant experience since i&#x27;ve never experienced that with a mask before. Then I rinsed it off with warm water while making circular motions to really exfoliate my face and OH MYGOODNESS. When I patted my face dry my face was really smooth. Like I couldn&#x27;t stop touching my face, it was so soft but at the same time it felt clean and the good part is that it doesn&#x27;t feel all dry and tight and i felt like i didn&#x27;t have to put a ton of moisturizer on my face. So with that I could already feel that i&#x27;ll be using this all the time because it&#x27;s unlike any other exfoliators i&#x27;ve used and the thing is it is such an amazing product for such a cheap price!</li>
            <li> I tried this on a whim from the sample packets you can buy at Walmart and I loved it. Especially for the price. It has kind of a warming sensation, which I liked. When rinsed off my skin is super soft and I use it in conjunction with another product I like to control shine for hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, I wouldn&#x27;t use it every day and if I scrub too vigorously, my cheeks do get a little red. Nothing permanent, but take it easy until you know what your skin will tolerate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love it!</li>
            <li> i have very oily skin and im allergic to citrus acid so it&#x27;s hard for me to find something that won&#x27;t irritate my skin then I found this it&#x27;s amazing makes my face feel so soft and clean I&#x27;ve had one bottle for two months and I haven&#x27;t ran out I would recommend this to anyone 😊</li>
            <li> Its a grain similar to Tree Hut body scrubs (a bit grittier than a fine grain like most face washes), no odd odors, taste like sugar (obviously lol) if you accidentally get it your mouth lol. Its not chemically painful or super strong, and does a very good job with skin polishing and detox. I have sensitve skin and have no experienced any issues with this item. I have seen a noticeable difference after immediate use and improved skin condition with continued use. Its a very good product. I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> This is a heavy duty scrub. It works very well.</li>
            <li> I bought it after a youtuber recommended it. This mask seems to work ok, i do feel like it leaves a bit of an oil feel after i rinse it off, no break out tho, so i think it&#x27;s doing it&#x27;s job. Have not been using long enough to really  give it a nice review. Will update after i finished off the bottle</li>
            <li> Husband and I both use this.  He uses it all over his face.  It&#x27;s his favorite face scrub.  And I use it on my legs in combo with shaving to keep my skin super smooth.</li>
            <li> I stopped by Wal-mart and picked up a packet of this. It is awesome, my skin was instantly soft and looked better. I will be buying it in the tube now. Wal-mart sells small packets like a sample size so try it and see for your self. :)&lt;br /&gt;For you slower people it stays wet, it is a mask not a peel off or drying mask.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this! It has a nice smell and is so easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;I usually use it when I shower because then I won&#x27;t have to be afraid of getting it on my clothes and making black smudges on them.&lt;br /&gt;It feels very grainy and thick but once you put it on your face, that should be a bit wet, it gets thinner because the water seems to dissolve it. I think the grains you feel are the sugar grains because that&#x27;s what seems to dissolve when it comes into contact with water.&lt;br /&gt;When I rub it onto my face, I try not to scrub too hard because I&#x27;ve noticed that my face turns pinkish at the end if I do (so that may or may not happen).&lt;br /&gt;It makes my skin so much smoother and softer each time I use it and it seems to make my face brighter too. I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s suppose to do that but that&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve noticed after using it a few times.</li>
            <li> All I can say is, if you have problems with oily skin this will work wonders. Probably as well as the more expensive brands. A day after using it and still under control. One warning: it does heat up just a bit. It&#x27;s soothing but there&#x27;s no warning about that anywhere on the tube. I&#x27;d have appreciated knowing ahead of time. Not a deal breaker</li>
            <li> The sugary goop is hard to apply in a neat fashion and it tends to slide around and off.  It’s really not the most comfortable mask to have on one’s face.  It’s not very comfortable to remove either, as the sugar is quite abrasive.  You can rest assured that you are getting a good exfoliation—which is this mask’s redeeming quality.  You can read my full review at BeautyApocalypse dot com.</li>
            <li> Okay, so I&#x27;ve tried 3 different freeman masks over the last few months (Clay Mask, Charcoal and black sugar, &amp; Dead sea minerals) just to see which one I like best, and though I don&#x27;t think this one is the best I&#x27;ve used I certainly think it&#x27;s one of the better ones.&lt;br /&gt;People have mentioned a &amp;#34;warming&amp;#34; effect when you put this mask on your face and it is actually true. I was surprised the first time I put this on, it almost felt like putting a heating pad to my face.&lt;br /&gt;I used this mask 3 times a week after a vigorous workout. I have problems with breaking out after I work out and this product helped the problem, but only slightly. After I got home from the gym I would wipe my face with a baby wipe, dampen my face with warm water, and put a generous amount of the Charcoal and Black Sugar Mask all over my face. I would then chill out for the recommended 7-10 minutes. This mask did not harden in that time, it only slightly dried out. Then I would jump into the shower, do my daily routine, and scrub off the mask last right before I got out.&lt;br /&gt;I liked this mask mostly for the exfoliating effect the sugar has. My face was noticeably softer, and even my hands just from putting the mask on were softer. I did notice, about an hour after getting out of the shower and using this mask, that the sides of my nose, my chin, and my T zone were slightly oily, which is uncomfortable and it was odd because I do not have an oily face. With most exfoliation products, aside from a simple scrub brush, a little bit of oil is to be expected but this was an uncomfortable amount that I had to wipe away 2 or 3 times before I went to bed, and I woke up with an oily face in the morning. Although the oil problem was not as bad as when I used the Anti-Stress Dead sea mask, it was still more than I care to deal with on a regular basis.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve also used this product as a quick scrub in a shower and that works great to exfoliate as well.&lt;br /&gt;4/5 stars, I liked this product but Ididn&#x27;t love it, and I probably won&#x27;t continue to use it much except maybe to exfoliate in the shower once in a while.&lt;br /&gt;In case you&#x27;re wondering which product worked out best for me (I don&#x27;t have much of an oil problem, I break out after vigorous workouts and when I get my period), it was the Freeman Feeling Beautiful Clay Purifying Facial Mask, with 5/5 stars and it definitely noticeably helped my skin, I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I bought at my local grocery store for $4. I&#x27;m always trying different facial cleansers/masks and I have never found one that truly works. I have a blackhead problem on my nose. I&#x27;ve used strips and exfoliating scrubs and everything else but nothing. This mask is different. I used it once and most my black heads were gone!!!!! I just reccomened this to my sister because it truly is amazing. A tip that I have is to wet face with pretty warm water to open the pores then dry it just a little (I left my face damp) then when I started scrubbing I just wet my fingers and scrubbed and rinsed with cool water to close the pores</li>
            <li> LOVE this stuff. Makes my skin feel clean and soft and like new. This is a MUST! I have less zits and I hope after long term use it helps with blackheads. I don&#x27;t use it as a mask. The 1st time I tried it was too odd. It felt thin and I couldn&#x27;t help but want to wash it off.</li>
            <li> this product was beyond rough and sticky. did nothing. I felt like i needed a shower after to get it all off.</li>
            <li> THIS IS A ROUGH SCRUB BE CAREFUL.</li>
            <li> It cleans out your pores like magic. I noticed if I use it twice to three times a week it keeps my blackheads at bay. I have REALLY oily skin and a lot of blackheads on my nose and it makes them almost disappear. I read that black sugar works wonders and it really does</li>
            <li> Although it is advertised as a mask, it does not have as thick of a consistency as you would expect. I use it as a daily wash and sometimes leave it on to dry as a mask/deep clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Me: 34, occasional breakouts (from what I hear, they are hormonal around my age), oily skin (hey, less wrinkles down the road!), fair complexion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I truly love this product. It smells pleasant and makes my skin feel softer and SMOOTHER than any product I have tried. I also notice that my pores seem a bit smaller and there are less blackheads. My skin seems to get less oily as the day progresses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think I have found the best combination of facial cleanser and makeup for my skin. I use this cleanser in the morning and at night. Every evening I apply Neutrogena Oil Free Acne Stress Control Triple Action Toner.  For makeup, I use a fingertip sized amount of Almay Clear Complexion makeup (in beige 500) mixed with a drop of Clean &amp; Clear Dual Action salicylic acid Moisturizer and a drop of either Clean &amp; Clear Mattifying Moisturizer or the Neutrogena Shine Control primer (rice protein complex). I put a very thin layer (as thin as possible, no caking here) of this mixture on as makeup...just enough to even out skin tone and hide any slight blemishes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The result of this combination? The clearest, smoothest, and most even-toned skin I have had in years. Everyone always mentions how nice my skin has been looking lately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know sometimes that it is not one product, but a combination of products that makes a difference. Wanted to share this concoction with anyone who may have similar skin as mine!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck! I plan on buying this charcoal again, most definitely! Very pleased with the results!</li>
            <li> I absolutely adore this product! Like some have said, though, this mask isn&#x27;t really a &amp;#34;mask.&amp;#34; It says to layer it on your skin and then leave for several minutes before rubbing off. I don&#x27;t really think that&#x27;s necessary. In fact, I think this product would be better dubbed as solely an exfoliator.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is possible to use this as a mask, but it is very gloopy and hard to apply as such. If you can get a decent coat of it on your face I think the purpose of applying it as a mask is to let it work to soften your skin for exfoliation. Anyway, the reason this mask is getting five stars from me is because holy cow is it an amazing exfoliator. I have tried tons of exfoliators in my day and nothing has worked like this one. It gently removes all the dead skin cells, leaves my face as smooth as a baby&#x27;s butt, and I swear my pores are three times smaller after using this mask for the last month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for an exfoliator, give this a try before anything else. Freeman products are absolutely amazing.</li>
            <li> I cannot rave enough about this mask. I have very oily skin and I suffer from a lot of blackheads, but with just one application of the mask my skin felt cleaner and it looked like porcelain. It is a bit different than other masks you may have tried, since it doubles as a scrub, but once you get over the porous like texture, you will love it. The warming sensation is gentle and you can feel it working. I absolutely love this mask. I have been using it for 2 weeks and I am already getting compliments on how nice my skin looks.</li>
            <li> Good product I&#x27;ve had a problem  with my face being red and scaly around my nose and forehead  since using this product haven&#x27;t had much to none  redness and leaves face clean/smooth smells good and taste good as well lol</li>
            <li> This product has changed my life. I will no longer go back to expensive mud mask products! This product goes on to the skin very smooth which is a plus for me. The product comes over very easy as well. Leaving smooth and fresh skin.</li>
            <li> I really love this mask, the smell is amazing and leaves my skin super soft. Good price and nice results.</li>
            <li> not sure I like this. First, it is very hard to apply as a mask. Second, I don&#x27;t see much improvement in my clogged pores when I use this. I&#x27;ll finish the tube, but wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> It is a little difficult to put on but I leave it on for about 10 minutes and gentle scrub for 2 and my face feel baby soft and fresh. I was apprehensive about the black sugar and was worried it would clog my pores. It didn&#x27;t though, it left my face feeling cleaning and even faded out my blackheads a little. I do not recommend it for a daily scrub though. It is rather abrasive and daily use would mostly like irritate your skin&lt;br /&gt;I do highly recommend this delightful 2-in-1 mask.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more of a scrub than a mask, but either way it made my skin feel great!</li>
            <li> Black and coarse. Smells pretty good, but hard to spread on your face, if you try to smear it on like a regular mask, little chunks of this will fall off all over your counter. Just one or two smears is about all it can take before it comes off. It doesnt dry like a regular mask, you could probably even just use it like a regular scrub. It leaves your skin very soft and has a slight warming sensation as you put it on.</li>
            <li> The texture is a little odd when you first put it on, but once you recognize that it&#x27;s really not a traditional mask, you&#x27;ll get over it. It heats up on contact. I thought I was having a reaction, but apparently this happens every time. I have sensitive skin and it did not burn as I wore it or scrubbed. Skin was soft and silky. Great price, too.</li>
            <li> Most face scrubs are very, very tough on the face, but this one is perfect. It really does clean the skin and get the dirt out of the pores without doing any excessive damage. Most face scrubs make the skin extra dry and make your skin feel tight, but this one doesn&#x27;t do that at all. And the skin feels smooth to the touch. It&#x27;s great on the face and also great for the rest of your body too.</li>
            <li> really makes my face feel good, great expholiator!</li>
            <li> I love this product! Hands down one of the best things I have come across as far as skin care I use it everyday in the shower as my face wash and it works wonders cleared my forehead acne right up</li>
            <li> I purchased a sample of this from Walmart once and fell in love! It worked wonders on my skin! Over the next two months I went to Walmart on a weekly basis only to get more! Only problem was they were sold out every time! Then I discovered they sold it on Amazon, made my day! I highly recommend this to everyone.</li>
            <li> Feels like a sugar oil face scrub that&#x27;s bout it I could have made this myself. My face got irritated and red</li>
            <li> I decided to try this product after seeing my face for the first time in about 1 1/2 yrs. Sounds crazy..I know. I&#x27;ve been wearing the same glasses for 3 years and have just recently gotten contacts. I&#x27;m seeing everything so clearly, including my face. When I looked in one of those mirrors with the 2 sides (you know one side is huge the other is kinda normal) I didn&#x27;t like what I seen. My pores are larger than I thought, more discoloration. Anyway, I tried this product and my face feels great after only one use. When first applied, there is a warming sensation, not to warm though. I let it set for about 5 minutes then began to exfoliate as directed, washed with warm water and my face and neck feel smoother and softer than I can ever remember them being. I can&#x27;t wait to see what happens after weeks of use. Definitely will be recommending to my friends.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read so many good reviews about this mask however I decided not to try it because of the way it looked. This mask was great for my skin and I love the warming effect it gave me. I will repurchase and recommend.</li>
            <li> I need to repurchase this, it was fun to use and smelled great, and I feel like it thoroughly cleaned my face without being overly abrasive.</li>
            <li> I have acne, oily prone skin and I feel like I have tried every kind of product out there. I was looking at a more expensive charcoal mask when I stumbled across this. I am so glad I tried it! My pores seem smaller and my skin is smoother after using this. It has a warming sensation when you rub it on. I leave it on for 7-10 min, rinse and then moisturize. I am so happy I found a product that is easy on the wallet but still works!</li>
            <li> I use this once, sometimes twice a week. Leaves skin feeling new, looks shiny, and fresh. My new favorite face mask.</li>
            <li> I was pretty skeptical until I used it for a week. While I didn&#x27;t necessarily see an improvement in blackhead reduction, it makes my face super soft! I have been using Clinique face scrub for years, but I&#x27;m switching to this. I love it! I have dry, acne prone skin. This product does not make me break out and I love that it doesn&#x27;t strip my face dry. A wonderful product.</li>
            <li> Makes your skin feel soft for long time but did not work on my pores</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quite abrasive, so I suggest not to use it more than twice a week. I actually have used it on my feet, made the heels feel wonderfully smooth.</li>
            <li> Your skin does feel really amazing after use, but do use a old wash cloth for the charcoal does stain good ones. It has really helped me with my blackhead problems that are caused by using self tanners.</li>
            <li> Good cleaner but they should not label this as a mask!</li>
            <li> I love the way my skin feels after using this!!!! It makes it feel so smooth and the formula is not rough on my skin. Makes me feel so clean!</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin really soft and it&#x27;s a good exofoliater before you put on your makeup. I love this mask!</li>
            <li> The consistency of this stuff takes a little getting used to, it&#x27;s thinner than a traditional mask and feels more like an exfoliating scrub. But you just put it on (I do it in the shower while I&#x27;m conditioning my hair), wait 5 or so minutes, scrub it in and rinse it off and you will not believe how soft your skin feels. Before I used it on my face, I tried a little on my hand to make sure I wouldn&#x27;t have a weird reaction (I have crazy sensitive skin) and not only was the back of my hand silky smooth but it smelled amazing. I couldn&#x27;t stop sniffing! I&#x27;ve also started using it on those annoying little red bumps on my upper arms and it&#x27;s definitely made my skin smoother and more even toned. Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> this is the only charcoal scrub/mask that had such a high rating and such great feedback so I decided to try it. ive used it 2x and it made my extremely smooth! it&#x27;s kind of crazy how it dries the acne but adds such great moisture (without an oily feeling)! and the smell is beautiful!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the consistency is odd, as most would expect a mask to be thick/gunky but it truly gets the job done. just know when you put it in it will appear faint - don&#x27;t worry you&#x27;re doing it right! the directions don&#x27;t mention to wash your face first but it only makes sense to do that first..leave your face wet but not dripping - maybe dab it lightly with a towel before applying the mask.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I thought this was like a facial wash but it is a mask and thats ok because I still love how it works! You leave it on for about 6 minutes then scrub it and wash it off. My face was baby smooth, incredible really! I also used it on my brother and his skin is very oily. It made his skin super smooth and matte. I would highly suggest this to anyone just make sure to use a moisturizer after!</li>
            <li> Great scrub. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend for sensitive skin. I have fair skin and it&#x27;s a bit rough and my skin stays red for a little while after, but feels clean!</li>
            <li> I used it as a exfoliator. It worked great</li>
            <li> I bought this product orginally for blackheads its a little hard to apply to your face because its like a gel scrub almost. But after 5 miniutes and 2 of scrubing it left my skin exstreamly soft. As for blackheads I could see less on my nose. And I&#x27;m guessing over time they will hopefully go away.</li>
            <li> Works great, can actually see it pull the gunk out of pores which is gross but great in the long run. I use it a few times a week and daily on zits to make them surface and go away faster. Has been working great!</li>
            <li> I love this scrub! When you put it on it makes your skin feel warm. The scrub is gentle, my skin felt amazing</li>
            <li> This is the best mask I&#x27;ve ever applied. I couldn&#x27;t believe how soft my skin felt, and how quickly it removed blackheads. I mean, my skin is SO SOFT.&lt;br /&gt;That being said, I absolutely hate how it feels on my face. When you give it any friction whatsoever, it begins to actually feel hot. I know some people like how that feels, but I think it&#x27;s weird and uncomfortable.&lt;br /&gt;However, the results are so amazing that I would still highly recommend this product, and I intend to keep using and buying it for myself.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why they market this as a mask.  You put it on and it doesn&#x27;t dry at all.  I left it on for even longer than the 7 minutes it says to and it was still the same.  But as a scrub I liked it.  Once I scrubbed it off it did leave my skin nice and soft.  I think I&#x27;ll use it as a body scrub in the tub.</li>
            <li> I first bought this in the packet size because I had heard good things about using products with activated charcoal for oily, acne-prone skin (like mine). It is kind of annoying to apply because it drips and never fully dries, but I just put a towel over my lap and it&#x27;s fine. I leave this on for ten minutes, then scrub gently as I rinse off. My skin is left glowing and soft without being clogged or dry, and I noticed some whiteheads drying up and less blackheads. I repurchased the mini packet three or so times before I decided that I just need the full size one! I definitely recommend this mask!</li>
            <li> Quick delivery. Good gentle scrub for face. Never makes my face feel dry just smooth and soft.  Reasonable price for good product.</li>
            <li> This works really well as an exfoliant and always leaves my skin feeling soft and fresh. The smell is also very pleasant. It smells naturally sweet without a lot of added chemical scents that some other products may have. I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference in the oil levels of my skin, but everything else about this product description rings true. I really like it!</li>
            <li> This is literally the worst facial mask I have ever used! I was completely misguided by other review saying this was great. It is incredibly grainy and should not be even considered a mask at all!</li>
            <li> I found this scrub while I was at winco (weird right?) I was looking for my apricot facial scrub by st. Ives I usually get. I decided to try something new and bought this product. I&#x27;m seriously amazed by it. The cost was enough to get me interested. I live on a small budget and so that was important to me but I didint want to sacrifice smooth skin lol.&lt;br /&gt;I have light acne around my eyebrows, temples and jawline. This product not only refreshed my skin but also helped scrub away old acne scars. Its dramatically reduced the amount of breakouts I get also. I&#x27;m hooked on this stuff!&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for something to refresh your skin and clean out your pores, reduce scars, and acne, and a rough scrub this is it!&lt;br /&gt;Also one last thing I&#x27;ll add is I hate the feeling of my skin feeling tight this gives me a perfect balance of moisture. It doesn&#x27;t leave a &amp;#34;squeaky clean&amp;#34; feeling, more of a natural clean if that makes sense. Also try the cucumber peel off mask. Also one of my favorites :)</li>
            <li> Excellent. Smells and feels great on skin, happy with softness of face and hands from applying. Ordered on a Wednesday and received following Monday.</li>
            <li> I am SHOCKED at the results I saw from using this mask. Overnight, my skin seemed to change completely! What used to be congested, seriously blemished, with lots of hyper pigmentation and scarring, was left looking smoother, brighter, cleaner, and like porcelain. My scars seemed to vanish, and my skin looked better than it has in YEARS. Unfortunately, the results didn&#x27;t last very long, but that&#x27;s understandable I suppose. My skin is still clearer and in much better condition than it was before, so I&#x27;m still in love with this mask. I only bought a small sample size so I haven&#x27;t tried it more than once, but I am purchasing it on here now since I can&#x27;t find the full tube anywhere. You&#x27;ve gotta try it!</li>
            <li> I did follow other reviewers instructions to use after taking a hot shower, to get some steam-action working. Then follow the instructions on the tube. The mask starts to feel warm when you rub it in but it goes away quickly. The real reward is the exfoliation after leaving it on 5-7 minutes, that&#x27;s when the magic happens. Try it - I can hardly wait to try some other Freeman Facial products!</li>
            <li> Great product and great seller - very pleased with both!</li>
            <li> I used this scrub before reading the directions and found it to be just okay, but when I followed the instructions I could really tell the difference. I didn&#x27;t want to clog my drain so I removed the scrub from my face with tissue and threw in the garbage. Once I rinsed my face I could feel how soft my skin felt. It was amazing! I agree with other reviewers who indicated this process can be a little messy (hence, 4 stars) so I always use this over my bathroom sink. I have to stress how important it is to follow the instructions exactly....make sure you leave on your face the full amount of time it says!  You won&#x27;t be sorry you tried this stuff!</li>
            <li> It has a nice scent, and feels nice, but it&#x27;s difficult to actually get on the face.</li>
            <li> i purchased this mask along with freeman&#x27;s avocado and oatmeal mask, i had heard good things about charcoal for acne prone skin and i was intrigued. it&#x27;s more of a scrub than a mask, i wish the texture was creamier. it&#x27;s a little difficult to apply, it&#x27;s basically just globs of thick black sugar. it warms up quickly and i really like that aspect of the mask, i wasn&#x27;t expecting it and it&#x27;s oddly soothing. i leave it on for about 5-10 minutes, then scrub it off. it works best if you really take your time and gently work it into your pores with a little bit of water for about two minutes. once you&#x27;re done your face will feel SO SOFT. i really like this mask! i have sensitive skin and didn&#x27;t have any adverse effects from using it. i enjoyed using the oatmeal and avocado mask also, i&#x27;ll definitely be trying more freeman products.</li>
            <li> The product works well and it arrived almost instantly after I had ordered it. It is a real money saver, if you want a scrub and detox for the price of one.</li>
            <li> i just love the crazy clean feeling your skin gets after using this product.  It arrived on time, tightly sealed in package.  Your skin feels...open...and cool....after using this product, like it an breathe again.  I couldn&#x27;t find this in stores and I will be buying more incase it goes off the market. Your skin doesn&#x27;t feel inflamed or scorched like how some scrubbers can leave it feeling. It took off all of my professional makeup.....even their own facial cleansers didn&#x27;t take off my makeup like this product does.</li>
            <li> This one was suggested by my best buddy with plain flawless skin! I would say it suited me well ! All acne gone</li>
            <li> My skin was so soft. But don&#x27;t be decieved, of course it isn&#x27;t miracle cream. Surprising warmth at first....left on for 7 min....scrubbed with a bit of warm water and washed off. Smells great too! 1/2 times a week exgoliant...not for every day use!</li>
            <li> Love this scrub! Went through a whole tube before I paid attention to the directions to use it as a mask. I&#x27;m on my fourth tube now - recommend it!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this stuff! It has a self heating mechanism so it feels wonderful on your face. Feels like a hit bath without the water. Thumbs up!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use this as a mask. I use Origins Charcoal mask for that. This stuff is a great scrub. A bit rough but my skin can take it and looks and feels great afterwards! I do recommend this for anyone with really oily skin like mine. And for anyone who likes a thorough exfoliation.</li>
            <li> Obviously this product isn&#x27;t minty but my pores feel as if they are breathing or cold wind is coming into contact with them. Mainly it is my nose area that feels squeaky clean. This would probably be too harsh on dry skin so you might want to look for that. Overall, I am so impressed. I would pay $15 for this product. It is that good to me.</li>
            <li> Its basically just a scrub.... Nothing mask-y about it, which is what I thought I was buying.&lt;br /&gt;I followed the instructions, left it on for 3-5 minutes and it just sits on your face, with clumps falling off on to your shirt/couch/dog&#x27;s head. Then, I massaged my face and washed it off, as directed.&lt;br /&gt;Again, its basically just a scrub.&lt;br /&gt;Alrighty.</li>
            <li> I found this mask on a sample at the drugstore awhile back and could never find it in a big bottle. So happy I checked Amazon!! I LOVE this mask. I have been using Freeman facial masks for many years. I have a pineapple sugar scrup which is OK and the dead sea mineral clay mask which I love but the best thing about this black sugar mask is that you dont need to leave it on forever like the clay masks to get the full effect. It feels so wonderful to rub it on my skin and it smells great and has a slight warming tingly feeling too. I use it once a week as part of my exfoliation routine and everytime my skin feels so soft and clean and very polished.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always skeptical about face cleansers and masks because my face is so sensitive that it can just have a reaction to anything (I&#x27;ll break out into huge hives for weeks). My friend told me about this, and I decided to give it a try. I followed the directions completely. I wasn&#x27;t sure if you were supposed to wash your face before or dampen it, so I just put it straight into my dry face (still not sure to be honest). I waited the 7 minutes and used the 2 minutes to massage. OH MY GOSH. While I was rinsing it out I could instantly feel how smooth my skin was. I&#x27;m currently writing this review right after that, so I&#x27;ll give it 24 hours to see if I break out into hives (fingers crossed I don&#x27;t!), but so far I don&#x27;t see any signs of a reaction.So glad I bought this because my face feels as smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom! Excuse my silly captions, I took the photos off of my snapchat! 😊</li>
            <li> I have really sensitive skin but this mask is amazing. Does not irritate my skin.</li>
            <li> Bust scrub for the price.</li>
            <li> This is a good product.  I love it.</li>
            <li> So I first I love love love the smell of this product so yummy . I have combination skin ...some parts are oily some parts are dry . My first use of this product my skin was evenly smooth I love this . I usually cannot tell the difference after the first use of the product but immediately I loved how my face looked and felt . This is not a charcoal mask just to be clear it&#x27;s a sugar mask ...imagine mixing sugar with a light scented olive oil ...(it&#x27;s not as heavy as olive oil at all) but that&#x27;s kind of the idea it does not go on like a clay mask or charcoal mask at all it goes on like smooth wet sugar . I didn&#x27;t have a problem with much mess . But anyway love the product</li>
            <li> Very high moisture, good price, good qualities, helps my skin so much smoother like a baby&#x27;s skin. I would recommend this .</li>
            <li> I ordered this product January 28th and I received it January 30th! I opened the package and saw they had taped the lid closed to make sure that it came nice and sealed and not squeezed into the mailing envelope. I used it last night and my skin feels AMAZING! I really recommend this mask. They sell these masks at Walmart, but oh well :)</li>
            <li> While this does make my skin feel great after I use it, I would classify it more as a scrub than a mask.</li>
            <li> I like this facial mask. My only complaint is that it is highly scented and my face breaks out to it sometimes. Other than that, it makes my face super smooth.</li>
            <li> i love this stuff my face looks good and feels soft!! &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> This scrub was ok, but I don&#x27;t feel it really did anything for my pores or texture of my skin. At 36, I had very noticeable pores. They were quite bad in fact. After using this twice a week for 3 months, it unfortunately didn&#x27;t help with my pores or my texture, although it was ok and did make my skin feel softer temporarily. I would have preferred it to smell warm and sugary, like you&#x27;d expect, instead of slightly floral.     This product might be worth trying, but I think something with alpha hydroxy acid or some other type of acid exfoliator might produce better results for you. One caveat is using it on sensitive skin. It can be extremely irritating because the grain is so large and it&#x27;s quite abrasive. If you have very sensitive skin, you may find this a bit too much for your skin to handle.</li>
            <li> A very good sugar scrub and very gentle as long as you don&#x27;t over scrub.  Really good value and smelled pretty good.</li>
            <li> I got this to substitute my love for Lush&#x27;s charcoal sugar scrub, since that is pricier. The price for this was excellent and not quite as messy as Lush&#x27;s. You also get more for your money and it has a nice, sweet scent. However, Lush&#x27;s left my skin looking better. With this, I can&#x27;t tell much of a difference. I&#x27;ll keep using it but I&#x27;m not nearly as impressed with this as I thought I would be.</li>
            <li> it smells good, warms the skin immediately, cleans it and makes it smooth, it is my favorite Freeman mask, can only recommend it</li>
            <li> This mask is awesome and left my skin beautifully smooth.  I typically have reactions to masks, this one was perfect and non-drying.  I recommend for anyone.</li>
            <li> I bought this on a whim because I needed a cheap exfoliating mask. It turned out to be one of the best facial products I&#x27;ve purchased in awhile, especially in terms of value. I have combination skin in the winter and this scrub/mask blasted right through that layer of dry skin and kept me oil free for days. The only thing I was initially hesitant about was the consistency, which is pretty gooey.&lt;br /&gt;I only need to use it 2/3 times a week. I just glop it on liberally and let it sit for 7-10 minutes. Keep in mind it will not dry or harden like a regular mask, so i wouldn&#x27;t recommend it if those are the qualities you are looking for.</li>
            <li> Let me tell you, I use an exfoliating face wash with the soft scrubs and everything. But they never work for me. I always end up with dry skin after washing my face no matter how hard I scrub or how much lotion I put on. Putting face lotion doesn&#x27;t help either because the dead skin residue is still on your face so  you&#x27;re just making them stick on your face which makes matters worse. Just feels gross and look unpleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most exfoliating products i&#x27;ve encountered only contain those tiny color beads that don&#x27;t do crap for me. This mask is effective because the sugar removes the dead skin on my face with gentle rubs while the oil in it moisturizes. I don&#x27;t even have to put on any moisturizers after rinsing off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- skin very soft&lt;br /&gt;- smells nice&lt;br /&gt;- the sugar removes dead dry skin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- May be hard to apply at first but it aint rocket science so you&#x27;ll get use to it.</li>
            <li> Better than my other $60 mask!! The sugar in it is a great scrub and it actually works. Love it! I have red acne prone skin. Also very dry. This mask pulled everything out and after about 2 weeks my skin looked and felt so much better. I use every other day.</li>
            <li> Awesome alternative to LUSH&#x27;s Dark Angels cleanser although to be honest I think I still prefer it because it seems to have a higher concentration of activated charcoal and none of the weird chemicals. This is just so darn affordable though, in comparison.  And it also uses the same two main ingredients: Activated charcoal and black sugar.  I can&#x27;t see using this as a mask.  The texture just isn&#x27;t really right to be used as a mask, but it makes a good facial AND body scrub to be used in the shower.  It also has a really nice unique warming effect.  Very subtle.  My skin has crazy reactions to a lot of things and didn&#x27;t have any problem with this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband ordered this for me and it appeared to be in new condition.  Though I think it could have been better packaged.  The lid was taped shut and it was through into simple bubble mailer envelope.  That&#x27;s it.  Otherwise, great price, good product!</li>
            <li> The first time I used this mask, I could feel the difference in my skin. It does a great job of &amp;#34;polishing&amp;#34; off the dead skin cells; my skin felt so smooth after I used it. I also did not have any adverse reactions after; sometimes facial masks can cause me to break out after I use them. No breakouts after this one! I really liked that there is charcoal in this (it&#x27;s the primary reason I picked it up), because it is great at pulling out the crud in your pores. All in all, I would definitely recommend this mask; and for the price, you can&#x27;t beat it!</li>
            <li> I love this scrub. I found out about this line of facial products via social media. I decided to try this verision out because I really like scrubs. I&#x27;ve since repurchased it and it babe kind of replaced my st Ives scrub.</li>
            <li> this smells so good i want to eat it off my face it really works</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good for washing your face but for some reason it&#x27;s not getting rid of my blackheads?</li>
            <li> This is a pretty sweet product. It does work. Like another reviewer said, it&#x27;s a process. You are not one wash away from a Charlize Theron complexion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I saw complaints about the texture. It was exactly as I expected. Similar to a sugar scrub you use in the shower. It&#x27;s not a traditional cleanser or mask. It&#x27;s a goopy sugar scrub.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jump in. Can&#x27;t loose at the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: Wanted to provide an update. I have been using for a while now. I put it on directly after a shower or a steam to the face. I then sit and watch some TV - the whole time massaging it into my skin. Love the way it feels. (Note: Might want to put a towel on your lap - again as it&#x27;s a sugar scrub, pieces can/will \\&quot;roll\\&quot; from your face)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product leaves your skin with a bit of a glow and definitely helps minimize pores. But, I have now noticed that my face is starting to break out a little bit. This happens to me after I get a professional facial as all the work draws impurities to the surface.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product packs a punch for it&#x27;s $7 price tag.</li>
            <li> Love the intense scrub it produces. It is a mask but I use as a scrub also. effective and fast. I have noticed less blackheads and pimples. I use this a couple times weekly with 3 days break in between or you may have irritation and the skin needs to heal.</li>
            <li> Soft and smooth skin resulted from weekly use of this product.</li>
            <li> I tried it and it is a scrub not a mask.  It has a nice warming sensation when on the skin.  The skin does feel softer after rinsed off.</li>
            <li> I was really hoping to like this mask, but i hate it. I used it once and then threw it out. I was really hoping that it would have real black sugar crystals. Instead, the granules in the mask are not black sugar, but microscopic plastic balls used to mimic the sugar crystals. It felt hot on my face, and after using it I feel like my pores looked more dirty than they did before I used the mask.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this mask. It really feels like the granules are scrubbing off the bad layers of skin and makes your skin feel super soft. It may feel kind of intense and rough but its amazing afterward.</li>
            <li> This mask is amazing. My skin is as smooth as it is after a microderm for a fraction of the cost. Smells good. Cheap. You really cannot beat it.</li>
            <li> It is really hard to spread it over your face because of the texture. Afterwards my face did feel really smooth and clean.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews of this mask and since it&#x27;s so cheap I said why not give it a try...loved it! It leaves my skin so soft and smooth and it feels so clean! I would recommend this mask to anyone! (It&#x27;s more of an exfoliator but it&#x27;s awesome!)</li>
            <li> great facial for healthy glowing face. I love it. Use twice a week and your skin will be like new..</li>
            <li> Must buy! Works great, after the first use my face was smooth and felt great.</li>
            <li> I love how this leaves my face feeling smooth and clean.  I use it in the shower a couple times a week.  I would definitely purchase this product again.  I love the value of the Freeman masks and facials.  This one scrubs away dead skin cells and leaves a pleasant herbal fragrance.</li>
            <li> to possibly describe how wonderful this facial scrub/mask is. I am a connoisseur of facial masks (twice a week), but I have never experienced any product that has made my blackhead prone skin feel like silk. I&#x27;m always searching for my &#x27;Goldilocks&#x27; facial products, and this is definitely one that I will continue to buy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased it in a one-use packet, and trying to squeeze it out of there was no easy feat. It was difficult to spread at first without clumps of blackened sugar falling all over, and trying to get the product evenly on your face is not going to happen. The product has a very light citrus smell almost like grapefruit and I did notice a slight warming sensation. I left the product on my face for 10 minutes and scrubbed the recommended 2 minutes. My face was a lovely shade of pink when finished, and I was amazed at how well this sticky material washed off my face.  I will be on the lookout for a bottle of this amazing stuff.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! It makes my skin feel smooth and fresh! It is a quick way to pamper yourself any time you want.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this scrub. I&#x27;ll use it 2-3 times a week in the shower with an exfoliating brush and my skin feels so soft afterwards!</li>
            <li> I love this product! I use it once a week to exfoliate and it leave my skin smooth and clean.</li>
            <li> Gentle scrub.  Skin feel so soft and clean afterwards.  It does have sugar so if it gets on your lips, yes it is a little sweet but you dont want to eat it!</li>
            <li> Sugar scrub with very little charcoal. You could just use sugar and lemon and get a better facial scrub. Disappointed in this one, definitely would spend the money for a better product next time.</li>
            <li> I love this scrub, it does a great job of polishing away all the dead skin cells. The sugar draws moisture to the surface of the skin while the charcoal helps draw out dirt, grime, and other impurities. Great price-might compare to Lush&#x27;s &amp;#34;Dark Angels&amp;#34; charcoal scrub.</li>
            <li> I love this product! I am in my late thirties and although I&#x27;ve always had decent skin, I&#x27;ve noticed that as I age I seem to get more and more blackheads and clogged pores. But even after just one use if this my skin instantly felt lighter, smoother, and healthier. I definitely recommend this product if you want an effective, low cost, low maintenance way of taking care of your skin!</li>
            <li> I first tried this mask from the little sample size they sell at Walmart.  While it was &amp;#34;fun&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;exciting&amp;#34; for me to try something new, I guess I just thought it worked great and decided to buy a full size.  I&#x27;m not saying that it&#x27;s a different formula or anything like that...just saying that once the &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; wore off, reality set in.  I&#x27;ve made my own sugar scrubs better than this.  Now, just because it doesn&#x27;t do anything for my skin (combination with the early stages of wrinkles trying to form but I&#x27;m fighting it every step of the way) doesn&#x27;t mean it won&#x27;t do good for your skin.  I would say this product would be good for a teenager that&#x27;s dealing with excess oil.  It&#x27;s just not for me.</li>
            <li> I am in my late 30&#x27;s an notice a few black heads or build up in my pores so I decided to give this facial mask/scrub a try. I have to say the scrub have helped clean most of those stubbing build up on my faces making me look a bit more younger. I don&#x27;t ware a lot of make up so I figure the build up must come from being exposed to the outside or left over soap. What cool about this product it&#x27;s a scrub also but you don&#x27;t have to scrub your face you can just leave it on your face a few minutes and this also help clear up the skin. I use this product when I am relaxing in the tub. My teen also say he like it and I notice when he use this product it tend to keep the pimple down.</li>
            <li> It works well, I just wish the charcoal had a little bit more stick! Doesn&#x27;t really pull the oil from my skin, but does exfoliate well and make my face feel like a baby&#x27;s butt. I have very sensitive skin and this product does not irritate it.</li>
            <li> I do so love this mask, wish I could find this locally ~ my stores only have the small sample style packs.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this stuff and use it every week, without fail. Freeman&#x27;s Charcoal &amp; Black Sugar polishing mask is different from any other mask I&#x27;ve ever used. It&#x27;s actually a two-in-one mask and scrub.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unlike traditional clay or peel-off masks, I don&#x27;t wash my face before using this one since it follows as a cleansing scrub. First I dampen my face to help the mask smooth on and stick during application and I recommend anyone who is using this mask to do the same. Otherwise, it could be a sticky, messy and difficult experience. I usually let this mask stay on my face for longer than a traditional mask as well. Depending on how much time I have and how clogged my pores feel, I sometimes let it set for as long as 25 minutes. After letting the mask set, I splash my face with water and scrub for about 1-3 minutes. The end result is absolutely wonderful! My skin looks and feels so clean and is softer and smoother than with any other individual mask, scrub or combination of the two that I&#x27;ve ever tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think that this mask and scrub will work for any skin type because it is not harsh in any way. Depending on your skin sensitivity, you can simply adjust the frequency with which you use it and the time you let it set and scrub. Personally, I have sensitive oily skin and have to be very careful with what I put on my face to avoid rashes, bad reactions or break outs. This mask and scrub has never failed me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Freeman&#x27;s Charcoal &amp; Black Sugar is an essential within my beauty ritual and I can&#x27;t imagine ever being without it!</li>
            <li> Hard to use if you&#x27;re expecting a dense, creamy mask. This is a sugar-based product (glad it&#x27;s not those plastic micro beads though). It will look like you stuck bits of dirt and mud on your face but won&#x27;t look like a mask at all. Not that &amp;#34;looking&amp;#34; like a mask matters, but the coverage just isn&#x27;t there and it&#x27;s clumsy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And it can&#x27;t stay on long, at least from what I&#x27;ve experienced. It starts to burn my skin if I leave it on too long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to only use this on my hands and feet before showering, but am a little disappointed that I couldn&#x27;t continue to use it as a facial mask.</li>
            <li> It literally made my face feel on fire.</li>
            <li> Best stuff ever! Gets rid of the shine on your face.</li>
            <li> It seems to be more of a scrub than a mask.  Not my favorite Freeman product by far, but not bad.</li>
            <li> Awesome product.  But you can buy at the freeman web page for 1/2 this price. Smh</li>
            <li> Heard that this was a good spa like deep cleanser. I have no breakouts ever and never did, but is great for exfoliating....and after your skin is SO SOFT!!! Gone are the dry top layers.</li>
            <li> I gave this product five star, because it does what it says and more. After I used the product my complexion is smooth and clear.</li>
            <li> I just received this in the mail and could not wait to use it. Seriously, buy this stuff! It is amazing!! My skin is so soft and looks great!!!</li>
            <li> Background-- I have skin problems. Recently finding that if your diet is on point, you sleep, drink water, and keep stress down with regular exercise, then it is your products. I cleanse with pulverized steel cut oats, and moisturize with essential oils diluted in hemp oil.&lt;br /&gt;You can&#x27;t use this everyday, obvi, or it will dry out your skin. But it really does shrink your pores, get that dirt out, without dehydrating your skin (btw, big difference between dry skin and dehydrated skin). I use this as a spot treatment, and legit, is the best all natural, or closest to all natural, thing i have used for spot treating blemishes. On cystic, works in a couple days, on clog pore pimples, works overnight. For the summer, I imagine this will be my go-to for balancing my skin&#x27;s oil production.</li>
            <li> more like a sugar scrub then a face mask.. very messy.. again, not a mask at all.. and hard to close after using since the sugar is clogging the opening</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m rarely wowed by a beauty product, but I highly recommend this one. Some are saying it&#x27;s just a scrub and not a mask, and given the consistency, I can see why, but to get the full effect you need to use it as a mask. The charcoal needs time to do it&#x27;s thing. I put it on before I plan to shower. I recommend applying over a sink because it&#x27;s easy to drop little chunks of the sugar, though once it&#x27;s on it stays put. Bottle says to leave on 5-7 minutes, I do a minimum of 10, usually longer because I end up distracted reading the internet. Then once in the shower, I wet my hands and scrub for 2 minutes or so. I&#x27;ve noticed a great reduction in blackheads. My skin is softer and smoother. This doesn&#x27;t dry you out. It has a nice but light scent, and I say this as someone highly sensitive to smell, it doesn&#x27;t trigger my allergies or headaches at all. And really you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li> I heard about this from my sister. And I&#x27;ve used all kinds of scrubs , masks. Everything. This stuff makes my face feel very smooth and clean from any dirt and oil. I am 47 and my skin gets very congested around my chin. This mask helps with that.</li>
            <li> Finally, I a scrub that actually works! I can&#x27;t say I love this product enough! I Biore has nothing on this awesome pore over cleanser.</li>
            <li> I love this mask, made my skin feel like a baby&#x27;s butt. It smells good too. For the price it&#x27;s absolutely amazing. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I love this scrub.  It is a great product.  I use it 2 to 3 times a week.  It does a great job of cleaning my pores and smoothing my 56 year old skin.  It cleans my pores better than most scrubs and makes them appear less noticeable.  My face feels and appears smoother than it has in many years. The great price is a great added benefit!</li>
            <li> Not a&lt;br /&gt;What I thought it would be</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t typically write a review but after one use of this product I loved it so much I had to!  I have oily skin that is prone to breakouts and blackheads, I also have a fair complexion.  I used Freeman Facial Charcoal &amp; Black Sugar Mask and Scrub last night as directions indicate after washing my face.  I felt the warming sensation and noticed my skin was a little pink, but nothing uncomfortable.  After waiting 7 minutes I massaged the scrub in my face with damp hands for two minutes, rinsed, patted my face dry and then moisturized as normal.  The pinkness immediately subsided and my skin felt very smooth.  I was satisfied with the product but not 100% sold until I woke up in the morning and washed my face with my normal moisturizing wash, my face was a smooth as baby&#x27;s skin. It felt like silk!  After drying my face I noticed a substantial difference in the amount of black heads on my nose and chin, as well as my coloring.  I typically have a little redness to my skin and there was no redness at all!! My skin looked porcelain like.  I have never used a facial product where I have noticed immediate results before.  I gave it four stars only because I haven&#x27;t used it for an extended amount of time yet.  I am hoping that the with each use I will continue to see results and love it!</li>
            <li> My skin feels softer but is several shades redder in the initial hours after use. I have pale skin that leans toward rosacea. I use charcoal soap that works great, so I thought it would be a good fit.</li>
            <li> This stuff is fantastic.  I have tried a few different scrubs over the past year, but this is by far my favorite.  The warming sensation when you apply it is nice (especially in the winter!), and the scrub is not too abrasive.  I have used it with my Olay Prox brush as well as just with my hands and the results are great either way.  My skin is silky soft and very smooth.  The pores on my nose are medium sized and the texture can feel a little rough, so having a product like this to make it look so even is really nice.  After using this the texture of my skin looks great even under a liquid foundation.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this mask after hearing so many good things about it. When I used it, it had this nice warming sensation, which made me assume it was working. The day after using this mask, I broke out really badly (as in worst break-out I&#x27;ve ever had).&lt;br /&gt;I now have tiny pimples all over my face that won&#x27;t go away. It&#x27;s pretty difficult to find a smooth, non-bumpy patch of skin on face at the moment. I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin, so I didn&#x27;t test this product on a test patch of skin first. Evidently, that was my mistake.</li>
            <li> The scrub works just fine. Really, it cleans well and does a great job of cleaning oily skin. The problem is the smell. If you like heavy floral-ish scents, this will be great for you, but personally I was put off by the strong perfume. And it LINGERS. I mean, like, an hour or two later you still smell like you rolled in a rose bush. I threw the rest of the bottle away.</li>
            <li> Fantastic facial mask. When you scrub this stuff off your face, you automatically have baby soft skin on your face. I was very nervous to try this product because I have acne prone combination skin, so a lot of brands can be iffy and cause me to break out. However, this stuff was a gold mine for me. I am definitely going to keep ordering it because it has immensely helped with my acne. I use this product about twice a week to get all the dead skin off my face because I have random dry patches, and it always does the trick. Thank you Freeman&#x27;s, for saving my face!</li>
            <li> This product is AMAZING but I mainly wanted to write a review to say that the same bottle is only $3.50 at CVS!! Same with all other Freeman products, much cheaper at your local drug store. Buy it and you won&#x27;t be sorry, it&#x27;s the best!!</li>
            <li> Works great, arrived very quickly. Very impressed, skin feels clean and smooth. This product doesn&#x27;t smell either - Very happy with the results.</li>
            <li> Talk about refreshing I love to use everyday after work, It relaxes me</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to give an objective review here. First, I didn&#x27;t purchase this through Amazon. I got it for less than 1/2 the Amazon price at WM, after trying it in the &amp;#34;wee lil sample packet&amp;#34; size. In my humble opinion,  one needs at minimum of two of those things to get an actual bead on how well the product works. Second, I have that oily Mediterranean skin that actually ALWAYS needs hydration and feels rough a slick at the same time. I&#x27;m starting to get tiny fine lines, but @ 42, I am often told I look no older than 30-32...some going so far as to say 27. I have some old thin scars from a car accident when I was a teen, and some genetic skin discoloration toward my hairline, and have been doing TCA &amp; Lactic acid peels @ home.&lt;br /&gt;The way I use this (since getting the tube) is putting a fair amount in one palm, a glob just larger than a silver dollar and a half. I don&#x27;t wash my face first, but instead spread it as best I can all over my face &amp; neck-and sometimes I use more to get my decolletage. Then I VERY lightly scrub in small circles, to let the product start working into my skin. I leave it on for 10 minutes, and then hop into the shower. I then scrub it a bit harder-my skin isn&#x27;t sensitive-and rinse whilst still scrubbing with decently warm (not hot) water. I do the rest of my shower routine, and when I am done, I rinse again with cold water. This closes my pores well. I get out, wrap my hair, and pat dry my face...then lightly coat with monoi tiare oil and let in sit as I dry off.  After, I gently rub the oil in, ALWAYS in an upward massage. Sometimes I can by heavy-handed with the oil, so I pat the excess off.I use this product twice per week, and the oil nightly. Since doing so, I have stopped getting any &amp;#34;monthly&amp;#34; acne, the texture of my face has become even, and while the lines aren&#x27;t gone they do appear much softer. Because I use the oil religiously, this product has never dried my skin out. I suggest that those complaining of it doing so research carrier oils and decide which is the best match for their skin type and needs and use it nightly-ESPECIALLY after using this. This item is meant to be a pampering exfoliation,  not a miracle. My skin feels so soft when I use it, and I have to admit that the tiny blackheads I had are gone now. Just try it, keeping in mind that your skin takes work. Remember to drink plenty of water daily. If you can, spring water supplies the most benefits, hands down.research carrier oils and decide which is the best match for their skin type and needs and use it nightly-ESPECIALLY after using this.

            <li> Use this product a few times a week</li>
            <li> Love.this. I tend to get blackheads on my nose and cystic acne on my chin area. This mask clears up the blackheads overnight, and the cystic acne in a few day! It&#x27;s gentle enough to wear every day, multiple times a day, no redness or drying! I have used it as an exfoliant, but prefer it as a mask. Yes, it&#x27;s weird and clumpy, but it&#x27;s sugar!! Tastes pretty good if it rinses into your mouth, but, of course, don&#x27;t ingest it! Fab product, works the very best of anything I&#x27;ve tried over the years, even ProActive. I pair it with the Charcoal face bar from Lush, and done. Seriously.</li>
            <li> I love using this mask! It makes my skin feel so smooth and look so clear and glowing after I use. Sugar scrubs are gentler on the skin than microbeads too, so I really like it for that reason. I took a star off because it is really hard to spread onto your face - if you try to spread it, you kind of end up wiping it off instead. But as a scrub, it is excellent. I will repurchase.</li>
            <li> Never had problems with blackheads till I used this!</li>
            <li> This is a very unique mask. It is a scrub so it goes on thick and it hard to handle at first. But once you get to globbing it on your face its simple. I waited about 7 minutes then scrubbed for 2. This is a 2 part mask and it leaves your skin super soft and supple. I love all Freeman masks and this one is one of their best.&lt;br /&gt;Not tested on animals either :)</li>
            <li> i love this stuff! it feels really good when you put it on, even has a warm tingle to it when you first put it on. love that it has charcoal in it too. great for acne</li>
            <li> Love this product! Face feels so smooth afterwards !</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a professional esthetician and have used the most expensive, high end versions of this kind of scrub and I still love this! It&#x27;s best used like a gommage and the sugar in it disolves in water, so no sticky residue or difficulty rinsing off!</li>
            <li> This product is amazing &amp; does it&#x27;s job. Left my skin feel so moisturezed.</li>
            <li> Tried this after I read about it in a magazine as one of the &amp;#34;top five&amp;#34; facial scrubs. I have tried everything from St.Ives Apricot fromt he CVS to the fancy stuff from Sephora. This is the best I&#x27;ve tried. Smells FABULOUS, sugary but not overwhelming. It warms SLIGHTLY (VERY slightly!) as you scrub it on your face, and when you wash it off: Ahh, I feel smooth and soft like a goddess and no residue, no redness, dryness, or &amp;#34;tight&amp;#34; feeling. And the price is great. Big bottle, I only need a dime size for my whole face a few times a week. Has taken its place of honor in my shower.</li>
            <li> For a product so inexpensive compared to other, high-end masks, it certainly delivers every bit it promises. When first applied, it feels like smearing honey on my face. I usually let in soak in for a few minutes, then I start scrubbing gently. I don&#x27;t press too hard or for too long, I overdid it once and my very sensitive skin didn&#x27;t appreciate it. But a gentle massage is perfect.&lt;br /&gt;I licked it off my lips couple times, it&#x27;s so sweet I wanted to lick some some...I hope ingesting a tiny amount isn&#x27;t toxic :)&lt;br /&gt;Anyhow, it leaved the skin nicely exfoliated and soft, ready for the serum and moisturizer (the mask itself moisturizes some)&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m certainly happy I came across this wonderful product and bought it.</li>
            <li> After using this mask for 2 weeks I can already tell a difference in my skin. My face is softer, my complexion is clearing up and skin tone is more even. I love that it&#x27;s not only a mask but a scrub for when you wash it off. When I first splash water onto my face to start scrubbing I feel a soothing warmth coming off the mask. I also love that the scrub is made from sugar so I know it helps moisturize my skin and will dissolve and not pollute the ocean like other scrubs that use tiny plastic pieces.</li>
            <li> I really like it.  My skin feels and smells wonderful after using this product.</li>
            <li> This stuff makes my face so soft, I absolutely love it. I couldn&#x27;t find the 6oz size in any stores so I&#x27;m so glad I found this!</li>
            <li> I was planning to purchase this full-sized product but before I did, I went onto their website and decided to try the travel-sized packet first. I thought the mask did exactly as it claims to do: to rid your face of oil and impurities. My face did feel cleaner, looked brighter, and was very soft. However, the reason I&#x27;m giving it 3-stars is because the mask was way too greasy/oily. It looks like black sugar paste but feels super oily when applying it and suffocating. After applying it to my face, my hands felt greasy even after I washed off the product with soap. I have an oily face (hence trying this product) and was paranoid that this mask was going to just make my face even more oily. Thankfully it didn&#x27;t, but still, I did not enjoy using this mask.</li>
            <li> if you want to make your skin glowing and shining this the mask for you. it wont cleanse your pores very well but it can make your skin super smooth and glowing i highy reccommend this to everyone and plus its cheap which is awesome</li>
            <li> I AM SO HAPPY I PURCHASE THIS. I SIMPLY LOVE THIS MASK.EVERY MORNING THE FIRST THING I DO IS APPLY THIS MASK.I FOLLOW THE DIRECTION AND THATS IT. DID I SAY I LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS MASK. YES DEFINITELY RECOMMEND THIS,GET IT. DO NOT USE ANYTHING ELSE WHILE USING THIS MASK,IT WORK WONDER FOR ME.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best facial scrub I have tried! My skin is so clear and soft I can&#x27;t get over it. The smell is nice and the texture was a little weird at first but the results definitely out weigh that. I&#x27;m super happy :)</li>
            <li> Amazing mask.I have combination oily skin and this scrub is perfect for my skin.But its kind of hard to spread it evenly though.</li>
            <li> disclosure: i have a pretty even skin complexion, but just wanted something to make my skin look more refreshed and glow. this has been great! my skin tone looks more even after using it. i almost gave it 4 stars because it&#x27;s not I AM RENEWED kind of thing, but for the price and ease of use, it&#x27;s definitely worth at least a try.</li>
            <li> this was not one of the best choices i made as far as skin care. this did not help me much with exfoliation and did not make my skin clearer. i do like the idea of the product though and the fact that real sugar was used.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a scrub. It leaves my face feeling polished.</li>
            <li> Messy. Better luck purchasing a straight charcoal product and exfoliating with baking soda/powder.</li>
            <li> I defenetly would recommend it for everybody, guys and girls! Your skin get so refresh after you used it! Love it, love it, love it!!!</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome! Makes skin feel so soft. Just leave on too long. Takes care of dead skin and red spots diminish.</li>
            <li> I use this product every two weeks and my face feels like a baby&#x27;s butt! I used to get this product from those small packets in Wal-mart but decided I liked it so much I needed to save money and buy the full product. If you want to have absolutely incredibly soft skin I recommend this product. Great for those mornings/afternoons/evenings were you want to be in a nice bubble bath and relax.</li>
            <li> This is a poor copy of Dark Angels from Lush.  The major difference is that Dark Angels works, and this doesn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had to stop using Freeman Charcoal &amp; black Sugar scrub less than a week after I began because of two reasons.&lt;br /&gt;#1.  It never really cleansed my skin.  After I try a new face wash, I always perform an effectiveness test by wiping my forehead with a damp paper towel after washing my face to see if any dirt was left over.  This face wash failed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;#2.  This made my face develop acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ONLY good thing I can say about this stuff is that it didn&#x27;t dry out my skin and it also has a nice fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;If you want a charcoal cleanser that actually works, you should try Dark Angels from Lush.</li>
            <li> I tried it, but it is not what I was expecting.  For once, I missed the review that said it was grainy/sugary and messy.  I wanted a creamy/ clay like mask.</li>
            <li> I love all freeman products. This one is no exception. The charcoal pulls the dirt out of your pores and leaves your skin fresh and exfoliated.</li>
            <li> Enjoy freeman mask so much. This one is my favorite. Make my skin look healthier and brighter! Use it after a long day before going to bed , never disappointed me.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough about this scrub! I use this in the shower because its nice to get a big glob and work it on to your face. It feels like its heating up on you skin! It feels WONDERFUL! After you rinse it off, your skin feels jelly like.... in a good way! It feels like you went to a spa!</li>
            <li> This scrub/mask is the perfect consistency to me; it&#x27;s really grainy and feels like it&#x27;s getting the job done. I leave the mask on for about 7 minutes and scrub away, and afterwards my skin feels sooooo soft and my pores feel like they can breathe again, haha. It smells pretty nice... I don&#x27;t know what to compare the smell to. It&#x27;s neither fruity nor floral. It does seem to have a warming effect on the skin. It feels soothing and not uncomfortable. It&#x27;s not tested on animals, has no sulfates to dry out the skin, and has no parabens that could be carcinogenic. This is my all-time favorite exfoliator, and I hope it never gets discontinued!</li>
            <li> It would not recommend this product.  While it sounds good in theory in practice its not the easiest to apply.  I found that it dripped off my face as soon as I applied it to my face. The sugar is harsh on the skin and the end result was just to redden my face.</li>
            <li> The smell of this product is very therapeutic to me. Not only does is give my face a very clean fresh feel, but it also removes alot of dirt and oils. But be careful if you scrub too hard it may cause irritation!</li>
            <li> Added instructions: When rubbing the product in lean your head over the sink because little globs of sugar will fall off your face. Do not use a light-colored washcloth when rinsing the product off; wet charcoal leaves horrible stains. I recommend a paper towel, or simply use your hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, if you plan on wearing this around the house, prepare yourself for some perhaps racist or chimney sweeper jokes.</li>
            <li> Life changing! Makes my face so soft</li>
            <li> Charcoal really pulls out the impurities in the skin and the black sugar really makes your complexion feel soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> Rip off. At ulta this thing costs 4 bucks.</li>
            <li> very nice on the face! feels really good!</li>
            <li> Used this scrub 1-2 times per week. Leaves you feeling very clean and soft. Helped clear up my complexion too!</li>
            <li> Firstly, it smells incredible; and finally, because, it smells incredible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Apparently sugar masks/scrubs are known for that.  Didn&#x27;t know that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This goes onto my list of Top 5 favorite scents along with pool-side chlorine scent, fresh green tea, snuggle, dinner, black sugar polish mask. :D</li>
            <li> most amazing mask ive ever used. leaves my face feeling so soft and clean.</li>
            <li> This product made my sensitive skin break out even more. I would not purchase again. Product is more of a scrub not a mask.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!  I used every two or three nights, probably about three times a week total.  You can actually feel it working.  Or at least I can!</li>
            <li> I have been using Freeman Cucumber Facial Peel-Off Mask for years and got curious about the rest of their line. And with me going vegan over the last few years I been trying to find replacements for all my normal face wash line-up for a while now. Freeman&#x27;s shows up on the peta vegan company list. And with that I went looking. This product helped get rid of my dead skin around my nose and cheeks, also I noticed a big reducing of the oily skin I keep getting. I will definalty try out more of the freeman line and keep buying this one! It takes out 2 products with 1 hit, so what is there not to like!</li>
            <li> It was sort of hard to put it on at the beginning since it&#x27;s thick and scrub, but once washing it off my skin had never felt so soft and polished before. It&#x27;s a really low price to compare with lots other brands, and I&#x27;ve seen bunch of other reviews talking about how high the cost performance is, but still &amp;#34;WHAT A SURPRISE!&amp;#34; when I use it.</li>
            <li> The first time I used this my skin automatically went from oily and shiny to matte and normal! I apply as directed and sometimes (accidentally) leave it on for longer than recommended. With my hands, I slowly get a part of my face wet and start rinsing/washing/exfoliating with the sugar. Another reviewer said that if accidentally ingested it&#x27;ll taste like sugar. Well... it does, but with a weird aftertaste. That only makes accidental swallowing while using in the shower better! And as far as the cap issue goes, I keep mine clean. It opens and closes perfectly fine. If it doesn&#x27;t, I&#x27;ll rinse it and clean it so it does. That&#x27;s no big deal, and to me not a big enough hassle to where I&#x27;m removing a star. Amazing product and I&#x27;ll buy more once I run out!&lt;br /&gt;::EDIT 8/23/15::&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this mask daily and everyone has been asking me what I&#x27;ve been doing to my face! However, a few days ago I took it a bit too far and accidentally/purposely (will explain) went against the recommended leave-on time and left the mask on my face for at least 20-35 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;I applied the mask as I usually would and decided that I would leave it on a bit longer this time. Now, I was expecting to leave it on for another five minutes (11 in total; I leave it on for 6), not 25! I sat in front of my computer and played a few games while still very aware I had the mask on my face. I&#x27;m not sure anyone else has this problem, but I apply a small amount to my upper lip and when I breathe out of my nose it burns/stings a bit. Well as I was on my computer, my entire face started to do this too! I thought it was doing something to my face (it was... not a good thing, lol), so I left it on longer. The burning never subsided and actually got so bad to the point where I had to get up, rush to my sink, and immediately rinse the mask off my face while (almost painfully) exfoliating and rubbing the sugar off. The burning/stinging feeling was still irritating my skin even after I washed it off, and while I went to bed (after I used my Palmer&#x27;s face oil, it soothed the stinging a bit and I realized that my skin was probably the smoothest it&#x27;s been since I was younger). The good news is that I don&#x27;t see any noticeable damage and it didn&#x27;t leave my skin red (but did make the peeling around my nose quite worse), but even though there isn&#x27;t anything I can see, there was definitely something that caused the irritating burn and possibly some damage to my skin that I have yet to find out about. From now on I&#x27;ll leave the mask on as directed and do what I was doing before; no more experiments, I&#x27;m concerned about my skin even more. And even though I&#x27;m sure there isn&#x27;t really anyone out there who&#x27;d leave it on for this long, PLEASE DON&#x27;T DO THIS! Oh my goodness, especially if you have sensitive skin. I couldn&#x27;t imagine!to bed (after I used my Palmer&#x27;s face oil, it soothed the stinging a bit and I realized that my skin was probably the smoothest it&#x27;s been since I was younger).

            <li> Don&#x27;t think I like it&lt;br /&gt;Guess it&#x27;s over exaggerated! Will keep using to see</li>
            <li> When my face feels really dirty , this stuff cleans very well pores look clear and clear . i use it about once a week but a little bit goes a long way</li>
            <li> My face looks totally refreshed when I am finished with this.  It definitely removes a layer of dead skin.  As with all facial products, my skin tends to slightly break-out (just one blemish) after I use, but I think with time it will get used to and stop.  I will continue to use on a weekly basis and see if I notice real change after a couple of months.</li>
            <li> Great product! Face feels really clean!</li>
            <li> Works great! Both my nephew and I love it. You can see and feel the difference right away.</li>
            <li> This is the only mask I use on myself and my facial clients.  Its great.  This one arrived within a day or so and was well packaged and brand new.  The scrub I use once a week and the charcoal helps with my menopausal breakout skin.  I roll onto my face and it gets warm. I remove with a wet face cloth and I am done.  Its a great product and if you suffer with breakouts give it a try.  A+</li>
            <li> Superb product !!! Love it !!</li>
            <li> you can see the results from the first use</li>
            <li> love this-makes your skin so smooth</li>
            <li> I have fairly sensitive skin and am not a big fan of physical exfoliants for my face unless they&#x27;re really gentle. The sugar is a bit much for me. It just left my face really red.  Probably useful if you have pretty tough skin but most people don&#x27;t recommend sugar scrubs on your face so just keep that in mind!</li>
            <li> I have trouble with my skin and this mask is a godsend for me! It is both a mask and a scrub, which I love! It has a nice warming quality and it is grainy enough that I can really feel it doing it&#x27;s job when I scrub it off. My skin has never felt softer and it does visibly brighten my skin. Granted, it doesn&#x27;t last very long, but I haven&#x27;t found a mask that does.</li>
            <li> It is so good. every time after using it skin become so clean and smooth. I love it. Thanks and I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Love this scrub/mask. I usually use it just as a scrub. Exfoliates well. I love the warming sensation when u rub the scrub on your skin</li>
            <li> Okay, so I have relatively sensitive skin. Dry with the occasional breakout. This didn&#x27;t break me out but caused strange, pustules all over my face. I don&#x27;t think it &amp;#34;purged&amp;#34; my skin as much as caused a reaction. Beware.</li>
            <li> love this smells good too</li>
            <li> It came much quicker than I was expecting. I was excited to get it. I had tried the packets of it from the store but when I saw a larger bottle was available I was really happy. It works amazingly. Makes my face nice and smooth. It doesn&#x27;t dry like normal masks but when your done with it I promise you&#x27;ll be happy!</li>
            <li> Works great with my Gurin Face and Body Ultra Clean Brush 4-in-1 SPA Cleansing System</li>
            <li> Makes skin amazingly soft</li>
            <li> best stuff on the market!!!!!</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful cleanser/scrub product.  The sugar crystals work very well and your skin feels so clean. I would recommend  this product to anyone.p</li>
            <li> Love this stuff, though the lid doesn&#x27;t clasp shut (which made it leak when being shipped to me) but other than that it cleans my face wonderfully</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really feel a difference.</li>
            <li> So messy to use. Black clumps of goo got all over the vanity and sink. The consistency makes it really awkward to use. Baking soda is a better exfoliator, anyway.</li>
            <li> Finding this product was an interesting experience. Amazon does a really good job of alerting me to new products. Having had a devastating attack of eczema in recent months, I have been buying a lot of products to get eczema under control.&lt;br /&gt;When I logged into Amazon I got a nice display of eczema products and this product which left me scratching my head. Since I already use a couple of charcoal based products mainly for the tiny blackheads on my nose, I read the reviews for this. One said this was available at CVS so I went to my local CVS. Geez, this stuff was cheap; two for $7. I figured even if this was a dud I wouldn&#x27;t out much $.&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is great. It works on dry skin, dull skin, dead skin, and eczema. I applied this to my face and neck and decided to chill. You are only supposed to leave this on your face 5 to 7 minutes, but I was reading a book on my Kindle and probably read for about 20 minutes. Obviously it wasn&#x27;t harmful, but I applied a little water to my face and neck and just sort of massaged it into or onto the skin&#x27;s surface for about 2 minutes. I then washed it off with cool water, took a shower, and dried off. My skin felt really soft and my winter dried hands were soft to the extent that there was no more dried, painful skin om my hands and fingers. At this point I was getting really anxious about how my face looked.&lt;br /&gt;I got in front of my magnified and was amazed. The scale from my eczema was gone, completely gone. No blackheads, no whiteheads, no dry skin. Just clear, slightly pink skin remained. My dry skin was gone, too. My neck looked nice and my hands are soft and pretty. Even my cuticles look nice.&lt;br /&gt;I have used this eight times now without any problemsI had eczema on my ear lobes and that&#x27;s gone now.&lt;br /&gt;I have used other Freeman products, but this is absolutely the best. I use it twice a week now.&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I can add is that I also apply a light moisturizer to my face after bathing and I am looking so much better and younger.ter and younger.</li>
            <li> Feels great, makes my skin really soft!</li>
            <li> I love the way this makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li> I am SHOCKED at the results I saw from using this mask. Overnight, my skin seemed to change completely! What used to be congested, seriously blemished, with lots of hyper pigmentation and scarring, was left looking smoother, brighter, cleaner, and like porcelain. My scars seemed to vanish, and my skin looked better than it has in YEARS. Unfortunately, the results didn&#x27;t last very long, but that&#x27;s understandable I suppose. My skin is still clearer and in much better condition than it was before, so I&#x27;m still in love with this mask. I only bought a small sample size so I haven&#x27;t tried it more than once, but I am purchasing it on here now since I can&#x27;t find the full tube anywhere. You&#x27;ve gotta try it!</li>
            <li> This facial scub works really well.</li>
            <li> This is absolutely amazing. I was surprised at first because it seems more like a scrub, but I applied it like a mask, let it sit for about 10 minutes then used it as a scrub. HOLY CANNOLI was my face soft after and I could swear the black heads on my nose were half their original size after one use. Well worth the small price, it&#x27;s effective, smells great and its so easy to use. I&#x27;m buying one to send to my baby sister as a gift I loved it so much</li>
            <li> Goes on lumpy and gritty and doesnt really dry in a way that the mark can be peeled off. It has to be washed/ scrubbed off. Seems to be comprised mostly of granulated sugar. Aside from the slight polishing affect of rubbing the sugar on and off your face, this doesnt really do anything.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for years. I love it! I use it 1-2 times per week before applying the Freeman avocado clay mask. It makes my skin so smooth. The tube lasts forever and it&#x27;s a huge bonus that it&#x27;s cruelty free. Also, if you accidentally get some in your mouth (I don&#x27;t recommend doing that intentionally) it tastes like sugar.</li>
            <li> Works very well on my face. It helps control the oil on my face and leaves it feeling so soft.</li>
            <li> Felt nice but Broke me out :-/. So I stopped.</li>
            <li> I have only used this one time just got it but even after just one time my skin was so smooth and soft.i love this stuff so much i will order more when needed i give it 5 stars well worth the money.</li>
            <li> I love the feel of  this, it&#x27;s best to wet your face then put this on, you feel the charcoal more  on your face, then when I don&#x27;t fell it any more i went my hands then scrub my face then rinse off, it&#x27;s a mask and scrub but the consistency is more scrub like</li>
            <li> ABSOLUTELY AMAZING!!! i&#x27;ve been looking for a polishing mask for so long and this is gentle enough for my sensitive skin but rough enough to actually work! i&#x27;ve already bought more!!!</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing. The smell is a very calming sweet and it feels great on my skin. It&#x27;s an oily type of scrub so it&#x27;s very shiny on your face and the sugar needs to get worked out to a smooth layer too. But once you put it on you can already feel it working and after awhile when you get to the rinse stage it comes of really easy and leaves your skin SUPER smooth and soft. Not dryed out at all. It feels amazing. This is now my go-to product</li>
            <li> A scrub that I can feel work, it goes on smooth and rinses off leaving my face feeling clean and clear. Can&#x27;t wait to order more scrubs and masks from this brand!</li>
            <li> This stuff is AMAZING! I&#x27;ve used most of Freeman&#x27;s masks and scrubs at least once, it does not feel like a normal mask, which is why I think people are unsatisfied with the product, but it is to be used as a mask. You apply the stuff to your face and neck, let it sit, which is when the activated charcoal works to clear your pores, and then after 5-10 minutes you scrub your face with it which exfoliates your face. My pores were noticeably clearer after one use and my face was SO SMOOTH. SO SO SO SOFT. Definitely would recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand the great rep this stuff has.  It&#x27;s decent as a scrub but the charcoal doesn&#x27;t draw impurities out of pores like a good clay mask does.  About the best thing you can say about it is it&#x27;s cheap.</li>
            <li> cant be used daily. very coarse scrub it if used one to two times a week you will feel refreshed. feels weird while on but once its rinsed off your face is like a babys butt</li>
            <li> Very very good - makes my skin feel soft,</li>
            <li> Cleans pretty well but leaves face a but oily.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m obsessed with this stuff. I use it 2-3 times a week.  I love the rough granules in it which makes it really feel like you&#x27;re sandblasting your face.  You&#x27;re not supposed to eat it but when some does accidentally get in your mouth you&#x27;re going to like it. My face feels super smooth afterward.</li>
            <li> I have ordered multiple times from this seller and the shipping is ridiculously fast. The product is AMAZING! I saw a difference right away. The texture is weird because it doesn&#x27;t spread out evenly but it&#x27;s a scrub so it&#x27;s ok. This facial has such a nice smell to it, but I will say if you&#x27;re sensitive to strong perfume like scents then this may not be for you since the smell is strong and a little heavy. But overall I do recommend it.</li>
            <li> A great product. Thank you!</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing. I am very particular and fussy when it comes to beauty products, but this made it to my keeper list.&lt;br /&gt;I noticed that my skin was so much more clear and that my pores appeared less noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;The only thing that I did not like was that the cap is flimsy, (-1star).</li>
            <li> I received the product in record time and I do love it! My skin feels and looks fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> This product works. But I still kind of hate it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very fair, sensitive combination skin and was looking for a charcoal mask that would suck out all the gunk. Having had such wonderful success with SkinFoods Black Sugar Foaming Scrub, I wanted to find some of the same elements plus charcoal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This mask isn&#x27;t really a mask. Its more like an exfoliated goop you sort of pat onto your skin -- don&#x27;t try to layer it, it WILL fall down your shirt, get into your hair and become sticky grainy bits all over your sink. You can leave it on your skin for a good five to seven minutes and achieve what it claims -- clear, purified and exfoliated skin. But the sugar grains are so large, so harsh and slow to dissipate that its like taking sandpaper to your skin! Stinky, perfumed sandpaper, mind you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ironic thing in all of this is that after using it my kind looks so clear! So, so clear! Damn. I hate the texture, I hate the smell, I hate the consistency. But I love the clear skin. I&#x27;m all sorts of conflicted here. I&#x27;m not doing to repurchase because I&#x27;ve still got half a bottle, and I&#x27;m still hoping to find that right kind of charcoal/sugar mask combination. But in the meantime if I use this product in the shower, very (very!) gently scrubbing and ignoring the smell I&#x27;m pretty happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its a love hate relationship.</li>
            <li> Happy with this product,  shipping was fast also.</li>
            <li> This stuff is AWESOME.  Has plenty of grainy polish to smooth out your skin and it even tastes a little sweet when it gets near your mouth.</li>
            <li> I have very dry and sensitive skin, but because I workout outdoors and have to wear makeup for my job, my pores get dirty easily. This is gentle and smells sweet, pulls out impurities and leaves skin soft, supple, and without redness. I suggest a face- steam before bed, followed by this mask for 30min to an hour (no longer or will will dry you out!!) It may cause a breakout after the first 2 weeks (i use it 2x a week), but after a month my skin is definitely cleaner, more clear, and less red. I also suggest this as a spot-treatment for acne overnight!! I always keep this in my vanity drawer. It&#x27;s essential.</li>
            <li> great product, my skin never felt so soft. first time I ever bought a face mask and i love it.</li>
