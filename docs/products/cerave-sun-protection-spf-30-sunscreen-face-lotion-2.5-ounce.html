    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>I find this to be an excellent product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m impressed with it&#x27;s longevity and it&#x27;s protection.  </li>
            <li>I find it takes forever to blend in well and doesn&#x27;t smell the best either.</li>
            <li>The body spray was excellent; it is invisible.</li>
            <li>This is probably great for very fair caucasian skin.</li>
            <li>Great sunscreen used at the beach no sunburn</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>How can a company be happy with this.  </li>
            <li>Provides good sun protection, but would not reccommend for using on your face.</li>
            <li>The good news is that it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.  </li>
            <li>Best of success in finding what works for you!</li>
            <li>Very pleased with the products</li>
            <li>I applied a light foundation over it and it looked great.</li>
            <li>I sometimes prepare my own &amp;#34;mix&amp;#34; with this sunscreen: I add a bit of foundation to this (in my hand before applying), or a bit of lotion - as my skin needs.</li>
            <li>I love everything by CeraVe</li>
            <li>I use their am and pm lotions and love them.  </li>
            <li>We had to mix it with the Cerave without zinc to be able to use it at all.</li>
            <li>I love this sunscreen.  </li>
            <li>Since that time I have tried several sunscreens and love CerVa&#x27;s the best!!!!</li>
            <li>and I am very oily!!!!</li>
            <li>Goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li>To be fair, I bought this for the 1st time at a local store, not on Amazon</li>
            <li>CeraVe however is lightweight and absorbs quickly into my skin.</li>
            <li>Great product, I even got a few for my friend in Brazil and she loves it.</li>
            <li>It dries very quickly so you have to do it pretty fast.</li>
            <li>Great for my little daughter though!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t mind taking an extra minute. :)</li>
            <li>very lightweight!</li>
            <li>First time this has happened on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I bought this sunscreen at my local drugstore and love it.</li>
            <li>I was thrilled to finally find a zinc sunscreen I can use, because I&#x27;m not at all comfortable with the chemicals in traditional sunscreens.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Came Very highly recommended by my dermatologist.</li>
            <li>You have to take your time and really work it in...and don&#x27;t use too much, but it&#x27;s protection for my face, so</li>
            <li>It takes everything well, and applies very well to the skin - I don&#x27;t have to think about my face after applying it.</li>
            <li>This has too much zinc in it.</li>
            <li>Have to really rub it in.</li>
            <li>But it worked really well for me.</li>
            <li>Even after I tried and tried to gently rub it in.</li>
            <li>Love Cerave facial cleanser and had all kinds of high hopes for this product (\\&quot;dries to a clear finish\\&quot; was a real selling point).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m allergic to regular chemical sunscreens, and love other CeraVe products, so I was excited to try this.</li>
            <li>This lotion is good for sunscreen when you will be outside a lot or at the beach, but is too opaque for an everyday face moisturizer for work.</li>
            <li>It is a high quality brand, w/o a high price.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to look for something else with equally high levels of Zinc Oxide.</li>
            <li>So it&#x27;s probably fine for the beach, but I can&#x27;t really use it as an every day sunscreen because I don&#x27;t want to walk around all day with tiny white flakes on my face.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t normally write reviews for products because generally the product does what it says it will do.</li>
            <li>Who wants a white film on their face?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Spend your good money on a brand that doesn&#x27;t sell fake product.</li>
            <li>i usually burn and with one application, i was fine for the day-</li>
            <li>I have a medium olive complexion and it absorbed completely and dried clear.</li>
            <li>At any rate, it almost completely blocked all sun unlike regular sunscreens, so I wouldn&#x27;t use this if you want to get any color from the sun at all.</li>
            <li>It goes on super thick and won&#x27;t budge.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve had some issues in the past with certain products that I&#x27;ve purchased on Amazon - hair styling creams, razor blades, etc., that are possibly counterfeits, as they are completely different than what I buy in my local stores.</li>
            <li> However I gotta mention that it leaves the face a little whiter than normal.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was all set to buy my next tube of CeraVe on Amazon, as it&#x27;s six dollars cheaper than at the drug store, but after reading some of the other reviews, I&#x27;m concerned that this product might not be the same as what I currently have.</li>
            <li> So much for any claims of being invisible - it just sat on my face, thick and white as ever.</li>
            <li> If I wanted the product I received I would have ordered or bought long ago.</li>
            <li> The product I received is for dry skin</li>
            <li> Physical block sunscreen works differently than the chemical ones and you only need a very small amount</li>
            <li> Sadly this was my first Cerave product and I&#x27;m afraid I won&#x27;t be trying more.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried every sunscreen around and the products that use zinc are always too heavy for me, they&#x27;re greasy, leave a white film and cause my skin to break out.</li>
            <li> It leaves a heavy white film on my face.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> I do see a little bit of white when I am applying it, but it absorbs and I don&#x27;t see it after a few minutes.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to get rid of the white zinc.</li>
            <li> I have dark skin and this product didn&#x27;t whiten out my face</li>
            <li> For a product that&#x27;s fairly pricey, it was awful.</li>
            <li> For the record, I have a history of oily skin and breakouts, but now that I am pre-menopausal, have noticed less oiliness.</li>
            <li> It left a white film that was difficult to blend in.  </li>
            <li> I just cannot believe that people are writing that this sunscreen is a thick gloppy mess that leaves a heavy white film.</li>
            <li> little shiny after going on, but what sunscreen isn&#x27;t?</li>
            <li> However, it leaves tiny white flakes on my skin, that sort of look like small pieces of dry skin, and it&#x27;s nearly impossible to get them off without just rinsing off the sunscreen.  </li>
            <li> So that looked horrible, these huge white gobby streaks all over my face.</li>
            <li> and is not too heavy.</li>
            <li> A fairly heavy sunscreen.</li>
            <li> I love the mineral sunscreen protection with zinc instead of synthetic agents which tend to spread into my eyes when I sweat, and sting terribly</li>
            <li> though I was ordering, I am not pleased.</li>
            <li> I used very small amounts and did small sections at a time.</li>
            <li> My experience with this product was disgusting and it went right in the trash.</li>
            <li> It makes your face completely white and you end up looking like a moron.</li>
            <li> The sunscreen was awful hard to apply turn my face white used once and threw it away.</li>
            <li> Quite simply one of the worst sunscreen products I&#x27;ve ever purchased (and I am a swimmer and have used a lot).</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I have a bit of a tan</li>
            <li> Yes it kept her from getting sunburned, but it was such an awful consistency</li>
            <li> (I purchased one by ROC that was particularly bad in this regard).</li>
            <li> I am disappointed in the product.</li>
            <li> This, however, I had to share because this sunblock is horrible.</li>
            <li> The face cream was horrible.  </li>

            <li> A little goes a long way.  I do see a little bit of white when I am applying it, but it absorbs and I don&#x27;t see it after a few minutes.  You have to take your time and really work it in...and don&#x27;t use too much, but it&#x27;s protection for my face, so I don&#x27;t mind taking an extra minute. :)</li>
            <li> Goes on smoothly. works well&lt;br /&gt;with my foundation and is not too heavy.</li>
            <li> very lightweight! I have dark skin and this product didn&#x27;t whiten out my face</li>
            <li> A fairly heavy sunscreen. Leaves a white cast on your skin and feels greasy. Provides good sun protection, but would not reccommend for using on your face.</li>
            <li> I find this to be an excellent product. I don&#x27;t find it greasy at all. I love the mineral sunscreen protection with zinc instead of synthetic agents which tend to spread into my eyes when I sweat, and sting terribly (I purchased one by ROC that was particularly bad in this regard). I love everything by CeraVe (I also use facial moisturizer and cleanser). It is a high quality brand, w/o a high price. I sometimes prepare my own &amp;#34;mix&amp;#34; with this sunscreen: I add a bit of foundation to this (in my hand before applying), or a bit of lotion - as my skin needs. It takes everything well, and applies very well to the skin - I don&#x27;t have to think about my face after applying it. Done. For the record, I have a history of oily skin and breakouts, but now that I am pre-menopausal, have noticed less oiliness. I think Zinc helps in this me in this regard, as a matter of fact. I wish I had found this brand years ago. And the price here beats searching local drugstores for promotional sales. Nothing works for everyone, this is simply my experience. Best of success in finding what works for you!</li>
            <li> I use their am and pm lotions and love them.  The sunscreen was awful hard to apply turn my face white used once and threw it away.</li>
            <li> stays with you all day.  I reapply two times over day...I work on dive boat that has lots of sweat, salt water, etc....I&#x27;m impressed with it&#x27;s longevity and it&#x27;s protection.  Came Very highly recommended by my dermatologist.</li>
            <li> Would not recommend to use before jetting out the door. I find it takes forever to blend in well and doesn&#x27;t smell the best either.</li>
            <li> I asked a dermatologist for a sunscreen that I could wear every day, and I&#x27;d mentioned that some sunscreens irritate my skin, so she recommended this.  The good news is that it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.  However, it leaves tiny white flakes on my skin, that sort of look like small pieces of dry skin, and it&#x27;s nearly impossible to get them off without just rinsing off the sunscreen.  So it&#x27;s probably fine for the beach, but I can&#x27;t really use it as an every day sunscreen because I don&#x27;t want to walk around all day with tiny white flakes on my face.  I&#x27;m going to look for something else with equally high levels of Zinc Oxide.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally write reviews for products because generally the product does what it says it will do. This, however, I had to share because this sunblock is horrible. You can put it on, but it won&#x27;t come off. It makes your face completely white and you end up looking like a moron. And don&#x27;t bother trying to rub it in, it&#x27;s not going anywhere! Spend your good money on a brand that doesn&#x27;t sell fake product.</li>
            <li> Quite simply one of the worst sunscreen products I&#x27;ve ever purchased (and I am a swimmer and have used a lot). It does all kinds of things I&#x27;d think a dermatologist wouldn&#x27;t approve of, including immediately and visibly clogging pores. It will not rub in -- you will look like a clown. It took me 10 minutes to get it off. Sadly this was my first Cerave product and I&#x27;m afraid I won&#x27;t be trying more.</li>
            <li> Great product, I even got a few for my friend in Brazil and she loves it. However I gotta mention that it leaves the face a little whiter than normal.</li>
            <li> Not greasy.  Does it&#x27;s job.  Very pleased with the products</li>
            <li> This has too much zinc in it. It&#x27;s hard to get rid of the white zinc. We had to mix it with the Cerave without zinc to be able to use it at all.</li>
            <li> This is probably great for very fair caucasian skin. Unfortunately, I have a bit of a tan so this doesn&#x27;t work for me at all.</li>
            <li> Love Cerave facial cleanser and had all kinds of high hopes for this product (\\&quot;dries to a clear finish\\&quot; was a real selling point). Alas, I could only feel comfortable slathering this on if I were auditioning for a part as a geisha.  Even the thinnest application freaked out my kids,lol. I&#x27;m a frugal sort, however so I&#x27;ll use up every last bit of the two (!!) tubes &amp; maybe start playing the samisen.</li>
            <li> Have to really rub it in. Reminds me of zinc oxide.</li>
            <li> This lotion is good for sunscreen when you will be outside a lot or at the beach, but is too opaque for an everyday face moisturizer for work.</li>
            <li> Works well but leaves face with a white film.</li>
            <li> I like this product, but use sparingly as it will leave a whitish cast on your skin, well it did on mine.</li>
            <li> To be fair, I bought this for the 1st time at a local store, not on Amazon so maybe it was different. But it worked really well for me. I have a medium olive complexion and it absorbed completely and dried clear. I applied a light foundation over it and it looked great. Physical block sunscreen works differently than the chemical ones and you only need a very small amount - you don&#x27;t apply liberally like with a regular sunscreen. I used very small amounts and did small sections at a time. It dries very quickly so you have to do it pretty fast. At any rate, it almost completely blocked all sun unlike regular sunscreens, so I wouldn&#x27;t use this if you want to get any color from the sun at all. Great for my little daughter though!</li>
            <li> Great sunscreen used at the beach no sunburn</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m allergic to regular chemical sunscreens, and love other CeraVe products, so I was excited to try this. It&#x27;s horrid! It goes on super thick and won&#x27;t budge. I couldn&#x27;t spread it around and it didn&#x27;t absorb. So much for any claims of being invisible - it just sat on my face, thick and white as ever. So that looked horrible, these huge white gobby streaks all over my face. But forget trying to then get it OFF. Not happening. My experience with this product was disgusting and it went right in the trash. For a product that&#x27;s fairly pricey, it was awful. Try something else.</li>
            <li> The product I received was not what I ordered. First time this has happened on Amazon. Since I did not receive what I though I was ordering, I am not pleased. If I wanted the product I received I would have ordered or bought long ago. The product I received is for dry skin and I am very oily!!!!</li>
            <li> I purchased the sunscreen in the face cream and body spray forms.  The face cream was horrible.  It left a white film that was difficult to blend in.  It is visible!  The body spray was excellent; it is invisible.</li>
            <li> I love this sunscreen.  It is not oily or greasy at all for those of us with oily skin.  Great product.</li>
            <li> I bought this sunscreen at my local drugstore and love it. I&#x27;ve tried every sunscreen around and the products that use zinc are always too heavy for me, they&#x27;re greasy, leave a white film and cause my skin to break out. CeraVe however is lightweight and absorbs quickly into my skin. I was thrilled to finally find a zinc sunscreen I can use, because I&#x27;m not at all comfortable with the chemicals in traditional sunscreens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was all set to buy my next tube of CeraVe on Amazon, as it&#x27;s six dollars cheaper than at the drug store, but after reading some of the other reviews, I&#x27;m concerned that this product might not be the same as what I currently have. I&#x27;ve had some issues in the past with certain products that I&#x27;ve purchased on Amazon - hair styling creams, razor blades, etc., that are possibly counterfeits, as they are completely different than what I buy in my local stores. I just cannot believe that people are writing that this sunscreen is a thick gloppy mess that leaves a heavy white film. So I&#x27;m not going to risk it, I&#x27;m just going to buy this at the drug store.</li>
            <li> I am disappointed in the product. It leaves a heavy white film on my face. It is NOT invisible as noted in the title.</li>
            <li> i usually burn and with one application, i was fine for the day- no burns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;a little shiny after going on, but what sunscreen isn&#x27;t?</li>
            <li> Invisible Zinc?  I zinc not.  Put this on my daughter, she looked like she had white paint on.  It did NOT rub in or fade.  She was white.  Yes it kept her from getting sunburned, but it was such an awful consistency I will be throwing this away and getting a different sunscreen.</li>
            <li> Not invisible. Even after I tried and tried to gently rub it in. Plus it takes quite a bit of work to get it off.</li>
            <li> this face lotion is embarrassing. How can a company be happy with this.  Who wants a white film on their face?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On another note, I like the cerave products, their moisturizing lotion for face, their pm facial lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUT, this sunscreen for your face.  Today I tossed it in the garbage because I could not find the receipt.  Otherwise, I would have returned it.</li>
            <li> Last month I had mole removed and it came back showing evolving into melaoma.  Since that time I have tried several sunscreens and love CerVa&#x27;s the best!!!! I total recommend this product.</li>
