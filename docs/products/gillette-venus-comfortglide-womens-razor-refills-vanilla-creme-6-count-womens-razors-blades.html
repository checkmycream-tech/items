            <li>The product does a good job.</li>

            <li>Love it and so convenient!</li>
            <li>Love these!</li>
            <li>I just love these refills because I don&#x27;t have to apply shaving cream and then shave -its all-in-one !</li>
            <li>I love these razors because razor burn never happens to me anymore!</li>
            <li>Love these razors!</li>
            <li>They smell great, and glide smoothly.</li>
            <li>Once the majority of the soap had come off, I was able to use the razor a bit better, but it still doesn&#x27;t do that great of a job for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save</li>
            <li>I would suggest this to anyone who has tried Schick Intuition and liked it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The spa style has a nice scent.  </li>
            <li>You shouldn&#x27;t have to go through any sort of tutorial or training to effectively use a razor cartridge, and that&#x27;s what I feel like I need to get these to work</li>
            <li>Nice.  </li>
            <li>The price on these is perfect and so much cheaper than buying them at the store.</li>
            <li>A new razor lasts me about two months before I feel like I have to replace it, and that works perfectly for me.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re good at making my legs smooth</li>
            <li>The best razor I&#x27;ve found by far but WAY OVER PRICED.</li>
            <li>They smell amazing and are so easy to use.</li>
            <li>Good price and quick shipping</li>
            <li>I find the Venus Breeze heads are much better than the intuition heads -</li>
            <li>so you can get a better shave.  </li>
            <li>love it</li>
            <li>I purchased this here because the price was so much better than buying from a store, will do business with these sellers again.</li>
            <li>I have been using Schick Intuition razors for years and love them.</li>
            <li>If anything, I do think that the Spa Breeze may require more pressure for a close shave, and I have cut myself a couple of times, which never happened with the Breeze.  </li>
            <li>My summer legs love this</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better on the legs, but still not the close shave I expect from Venus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love the Venus Spa Breeze.</li>
            <li>Love these.</li>
            <li>Love Venus Breeze and keep them on my Amazon subscription list.  </li>
            <li>I love that I don&#x27;t have to use shaving gel.  </li>
            <li>But they are still a great product and very convenient to use.</li>
            <li>can always count on the top moisture bar to fall off after I use it 2 or 3 times, and the bottom one about 5 or 6.</li>
            <li>I am so confident in the Spa razors that when my daughter started shaving her legs</li>
            <li>I love venus.</li>
            <li>The price is better here than anywhere else.</li>
            <li>They make shaving faster and more convenient by not having to use shaving cream.</li>
            <li>These are my favorite Venus blades.</li>
            <li>Love being able to get it on subscription from prime.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The blades are cheaper in-store and online.&lt;br /&gt;You have more control over where the blade is, as well as visibility.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li>curves better to access no-nos and pits!&lt;br /&gt;No</li>
            <li>more shaving</li>
            <li>Expecting a much better product from Venus.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s something you should be able to treat yourself on.</li>
            <li>I love not having to use shaving cream anymore when I shave.</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>My wife and Daughter both love these -</li>
            <li>what more is there to say?</li>
            <li>I love these razors...</li>
            <li>they give a lovely close shave.</li>
            <li>Much better than running to the store all the time for the wife.</li>
            <li>I love these because they have soap and moisturizer all in one.</li>
            <li>and I absolutely love them.</li>
            <li>and I love how moisturizing it is.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I love this product been using it for many years</li>
            <li>My favorite razor is the Venus.  </li>
            <li>Sometimes I am amazed at the items I am able to find.  </li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>These are my favorite razor blades.  </li>
            <li>They make your legs feel so smooth!</li>
            <li>Read more about toxic chemicals to avoid in beauty products here:    </li>
            <li>These are my favorite.</li>
            <li>I love these razor heads, as I do not have to use any shaving cream.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s much better.</li>
            <li>I love these with the built in soothing strips.</li>
            <li>I love not having to use soap or cream.</li>
            <li>Great price for the high quality.</li>
            <li>Great Product would highly recommend it to you anyone who shaves there legs.</li>
            <li>Since I loved the Venus Divine blades so much, I thought, \\&quot;what could be better than a razor with built-in shave gel</li>
            <li>These spa Gillette razorhead refills do the trick and the scent is fine, not too potent.</li>
            <li>I love them even more then the original Venus Breeze.</li>
            <li>Love these and was a fantastic price.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use any other shaving cream or gel, because the bars work excellently.</li>
            <li>, I can shave very quickly without having to lather my legs up with a separate cream.</li>
            <li>the soap part falls apart easily</li>
            <li>Amazon once again offers a great product at a fantastic price.  </li>
            <li>Good price, and nice to have on regular order, never run out!</li>
            <li>I took one star off because these aren&#x27;t as good as the ProSkin cartridges that I normally use.  </li>
            <li>I got this on discount, am I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t pay full</li>
            <li>Good if you like Venus Breeze; i don&#x27;t think it smells any better with the white tea scent (which is fine with me).</li>
            <li>These were a great price so overall</li>
            <li>Fantastic product that does not need to use a separate soap or shaving cream.  </li>
            <li>I feel ok with her using them and not cutting herself.</li>
            <li>They leave your body feeling so silky smooth and with no razor burn or dryness</li>
            <li>smooth shave,</li>
            <li>They make my legs so smooth.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t get any razor burn and legs are silky smooth.</li>
            <li>They smell good and they do not irritate my sensitive.</li>
            <li>I love it to shave all my personal parts, and it very good for your skin and very soft.</li>
            <li>Makes my legs feel nice and soft!!</li>
            <li>When Venus Breeze came out I was soooo excited because they aren&#x27;t as bulky</li>
            <li>First of all, I love my Venus razor.</li>
            <li>Maybe i&#x27;ll stick with the original and use it with shaving cream.</li>
            <li>These have been my favorite razor heads since they first came out.</li>
            <li>What you put on your body is just as significant as what you put in your body.</li>
            <li>This is def my favorite brand of razors - they&#x27;re soft and soothing and get the job done :)</li>
            <li>Comfortable to use, convenient, and quick.  </li>
            <li>The large lotion bumper things make it so there is no accuracy and create more cuts at the ankle and knee.</li>
            <li>I do find that the gel bars can get a bit sticky, but overall these give you a really good shave.  </li>
            <li>I kind of have sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>I just wish they were a bit more reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>Good price when compared to retail, especially when subscribing...</li>
            <li>The soap strips on these razors dissolve so quickly.</li>
            <li>These have a great scent, last a reasonable amount of time</li>
            <li>They go quickly</li>
            <li>they leave my skin incredibly soft and smooth, and I love that I don&#x27;t have to keep reapplying soap or shaving cream when it washes off in the shower.</li>
            <li>, I have to take a shower really quick</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t last long so they&#x27;re not cost effective but very handy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been buying these since they very first came out.</li>
            <li>or two will always buy as long as we can get a good price</li>
            <li>The delivery from Amazon was fast and free, so that&#x27;s a plus too.</li>
            <li>But I got this razor for free and I really like it.  </li>
            <li>It also doesn&#x27;t give a close shave, and you end up shaving more frequently.</li>
            <li>I love these, my skin is so soft after.</li>
            <li>The fact that you get 6 razors is nice because Gillette usually only packages 5 in their boxes.</li>
            <li>Worth the money every time.</li>
            <li>nice gliding with the white tea scent.</li>
            <li>I love how soft these are</li>
            <li>The only ones my wife wants to use, must be good for her.</li>
            <li>The only kind of razor I will use.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what it says and arrived quickly</li>
            <li>Other than that its a good product.</li>
            <li>right.</li>
            <li>Right to your doorstep</li>
            <li>And they are easy to use not messy.</li>
            <li>This is the only brand my Fiance uses and I can agree it makes her legs very smooth.</li>
            <li>2 more catridges for the same price as 4 of them in the drugstore!</li>
            <li>These are only OK.</li>
            <li>Not so much - I feel like I have a 5 o&#x27;clock shadow every day, and I didn&#x27;t buy into this line of razors to have to contend with stubble!</li>
            <li>Not so much - I feel like I have a 5 o&#x27;clock shadow every day, and I didn&#x27;t buy into this line of razors to have to contend with stubble!</li>
            <li>Even though gel doesn&#x27;t last long, these are great cartridges.</li>
            <li>They are exactly like the ones from the store.</li>
            <li>I absolutely looooooooovvveee these!</li>
            <li>it is the shave I get for the first 3 times.  </li>
            <li>Brand new and shipped quickly.</li>
            <li>I love these because they&#x27;re so easy, and I&#x27;ve become a lazy shaver.</li>
            <li>I have very, very sensitive legs, so I normally pay the extra money to get nice razor heads for my Venus razor.</li>
            <li>and you have super soft legs.</li>
            <li>Just like I normally buy only at a much better price.</li>
            <li>Good product, we won&#x27;t use anything else - they last a long time too.</li>
            <li>Even with the razor brand new right out of the package it does not give a close shave</li>
            <li>I needed some time to get used to the large razor head with the built in shaving cream, but it has turned out to be very convenient.</li>
            <li>but after that, the Shave Gel Bars don&#x27;t do much at all (except get in the way).</li>
            <li>These razors are the only ones that can make my legs smooth when I dont get around to waxing.</li>
            <li>Cheaper than local stores and appears to be genuine Gillette product.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t say much for a scent because who cares about that</li>
            <li>Makes shaving so much easier.</li>
            <li>I really like them for taking on vacation; again, because I don&#x27;t need to pack shaving cream</li>
            <li>The strips lather my skin very well</li>
            <li>Multiple blades are nice, but you can get that in a traditional razor.</li>
            <li>So easy to use; they glide up and down my legs, even the back where hair is a bit more course.  </li>
            <li>Love the pink strip on either side of the razor, no need for shave gel!</li>
            <li>but I just happen to notice more cuts compared to other designs.</li>
            <li>/&gt;They&#x27;re great for traveling, since you can just take one slim little razor (plus a refill if you&#x27;re doing a long trip),</li>
            <li>and they last a nice long time too!  </li>
            <li>While the razors are okay, they&#x27;re not worth the money in my opinion.</li>
            <li>I live the subscribe and save price as it is cheaper than buying at Kroger!</li>
            <li>I rarely use them for my legs because the blade is not very wide.</li>
            <li>What these are great for are 1) not cutting yourself, regardless of being a careless shaver, 2) quick shaving (largely because of (1)), and 3) travelling (no shaving cream, which always seems to end up messy during air travel and takes up to much room in my luggage).</li>
            <li>Highly recommended</li>
            <li>Highly recommend</li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive skin and this product has really helped to combat razor burn.</li>
            <li>so your legs are never smooth no matter how many times you go over them with a razor.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t last long, but I love that I don&#x27;t have to use shaving cream.</li>
            <li>Wish i bought more previously!</li>
            <li>To make them last that long…I make sure they stay DRY after each use!</li>
            <li>In other words they help keep me hair free where need be.</li>
            <li>Then I have to throw it away and change a new one.</li>
            <li>These razors are one of those things I can&#x27;t live without.</li>
            <li>At this rate, I&#x27;d much rather take the extra five minutes needed to lather my skin up myself, and return to the Venus Divine cartridges that I like so much.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>There is no need for shaving creme.&lt;br /&gt;They are somewhat pricey but last pretty well.</li>
            <li>also the razor works first stroke to the last of the gel.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re not awful, I definitely still prefer them over other brands, but they&#x27;re probably my least favorite Venus ones.</li>
            <li>I do feel like it is not as close of a shave because the gel bars are &amp;#34;higher&amp;#34; than the blades thus I feel like I have to pressed down harder and go over my pits multiple times to get a good shave.</li>
            <li>the first few times you use it (as long as you make sure to get it wet first),</li>
            <li>Smooth shave with little effort.  </li>
            <li>Finally, I got these refills at a decent price!</li>
            <li>The product is great for shaving legs, armpits or virtually anywhere you are afraid you may cut yourself.  </li>
            <li>This product makes shaving very convenient, but i was resistant to pay an arm and a leg at my local drug store.</li>
            <li>And the stubble may actually be longer!nd return to the Venus Divine cartridges that I like so much.</li>
            <li>I think you will be pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>now.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s very practical and simple, I can always bring it with me when</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not really a huge fan of the razors with the gel bars; in my experience they tend to cause more cuts than the regular Venus razors.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t notice them being any different from the other venus breeze heads, and I really don&#x27;t find there to be a huge difference from one scent to the next.  </li>
            <li>I recently discovered Gillette&#x27;s Venus line of razors (I know, they&#x27;ve only been on the market for a few years now, but I was holding on to an old favorite).</li>
            <li>It surely is convenient but I still only got 2 uses out of the blade before I felt like I was gonna get some serious razor rash.</li>
            <li>Generally, I buy the Olay razors, but I decided to try to switch to these to save some money.</li>
            <li>but since I only used one it may be too early to decide.</li>
            <li>So far Venus Spa is the only razor blade that leaves no bumps in my skin after shaving.</li>
            <li>After that, it&#x27;s basically useless, even if I use my own shave gel</li>
            <li>and they last much longer than I expected.</li>
            <li>I really want to like this product, but it&#x27;s just not worth it.  </li>
            <li>Obscurely enough, these put me in mind of using Mick Jagger&#x27;s mouth to shave - the gel-infused cushions are rubbery and spongy feeling, and as other reviews have stated, keep the razor&#x27;s blades away from your skin, as if you have to push past the \\&quot;lips\\&quot; to get the \\&quot;teeth\\&quot; to scrape the hair away, never very effectively, or if it is effective, it&#x27;s not without great risk of cuts from those self-same blades.</li>
            <li>When it DOES release that gel, it&#x27;s more as a concentrated, thin \\&quot;string\\&quot; of shave gel that never really lathers up properly, and this is with frequent moistening under the shower or tub tap, and after applying generous pressure just to bring the blades in contact with my skin enough to cut any hair.</li>
            <li>As others have said, this is the first Venus cartridge that I&#x27;ve used that has left me with cuts, and worse than that, nowhere near to a close-enough shave, all at a higher price than their other cartridges.</li>

            <li> I like that the shave bars are attached, it&#x27;s a good concept to have</li>
            <li> my wife loved it we buy this item every month</li>
            <li> The product does a good job.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem as good as store bought...</li>
            <li> Simply a good price for razors.</li>

            <li> Love it and so convenient!</li>
            <li> Love these!</li>
            <li> I just love these refills because I don&#x27;t have to apply shaving cream and then shave -its all-in-one !</li>
            <li> I love these razors because razor burn never happens to me anymore!</li>
            <li> Love these razors!</li>
            <li> They smell great, and glide smoothly.</li>
            <li> Once the majority of the soap had come off, I was able to use the razor a bit better, but it still doesn&#x27;t do that great of a job for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save</li>
            <li> I would suggest this to anyone who has tried Schick Intuition and liked it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The spa style has a nice scent.  </li>
            <li> You shouldn&#x27;t have to go through any sort of tutorial or training to effectively use a razor cartridge, and that&#x27;s what I feel like I need to get these to work</li>
            <li> Nice.  </li>
            <li> The price on these is perfect and so much cheaper than buying them at the store.</li>
            <li> A new razor lasts me about two months before I feel like I have to replace it, and that works perfectly for me.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re good at making my legs smooth</li>
            <li> The best razor I&#x27;ve found by far but WAY OVER PRICED.</li>
            <li> They smell amazing and are so easy to use.</li>
            <li> Good price and quick shipping</li>
            <li> I find the Venus Breeze heads are much better than the intuition heads -</li>
            <li> so you can get a better shave.  </li>
            <li> love it</li>
            <li> I purchased this here because the price was so much better than buying from a store, will do business with these sellers again.</li>
            <li> I have been using Schick Intuition razors for years and love them.</li>
            <li> If anything, I do think that the Spa Breeze may require more pressure for a close shave, and I have cut myself a couple of times, which never happened with the Breeze.  </li>
            <li> My summer legs love this</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s better on the legs, but still not the close shave I expect from Venus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love the Venus Spa Breeze.</li>
            <li> Love these.</li>
            <li> Love Venus Breeze and keep them on my Amazon subscription list.  </li>
            <li> I love that I don&#x27;t have to use shaving gel.  </li>
            <li> But they are still a great product and very convenient to use.</li>
            <li> can always count on the top moisture bar to fall off after I use it 2 or 3 times, and the bottom one about 5 or 6.</li>
            <li> I am so confident in the Spa razors that when my daughter started shaving her legs</li>
            <li> I love venus.</li>
            <li> The price is better here than anywhere else.</li>
            <li> They make shaving faster and more convenient by not having to use shaving cream.</li>
            <li> These are my favorite Venus blades.</li>
            <li> Love being able to get it on subscription from prime.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The blades are cheaper in-store and online.&lt;br /&gt;You have more control over where the blade is, as well as visibility.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li> curves better to access no-nos and pits!&lt;br /&gt;No</li>
            <li> more shaving</li>
            <li> Expecting a much better product from Venus.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s something you should be able to treat yourself on.</li>
            <li> I love not having to use shaving cream anymore when I shave.</li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> My wife and Daughter both love these -</li>
            <li> what more is there to say?</li>
            <li> I love these razors...</li>
            <li> they give a lovely close shave.</li>
            <li> Much better than running to the store all the time for the wife.</li>
            <li> I love these because they have soap and moisturizer all in one.</li>
            <li> and I absolutely love them.</li>
            <li> and I love how moisturizing it is.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I love this product been using it for many years</li>
            <li> My favorite razor is the Venus.  </li>
            <li> Sometimes I am amazed at the items I am able to find.  </li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> These are my favorite razor blades.  </li>
            <li> They make your legs feel so smooth!</li>
            <li> Read more about toxic chemicals to avoid in beauty products here:    </li>
            <li> These are my favorite.</li>
            <li> I love these razor heads, as I do not have to use any shaving cream.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s much better.</li>
            <li> I love these with the built in soothing strips.</li>
            <li> I love not having to use soap or cream.</li>
            <li> Great price for the high quality.</li>
            <li> Great Product would highly recommend it to you anyone who shaves there legs.</li>
            <li> Since I loved the Venus Divine blades so much, I thought, \\&quot;what could be better than a razor with built-in shave gel</li>
            <li> These spa Gillette razorhead refills do the trick and the scent is fine, not too potent.</li>
            <li> I love them even more then the original Venus Breeze.</li>
            <li> Love these and was a fantastic price.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use any other shaving cream or gel, because the bars work excellently.</li>
            <li> , I can shave very quickly without having to lather my legs up with a separate cream.</li>
            <li> the soap part falls apart easily</li>
            <li> Amazon once again offers a great product at a fantastic price.  </li>
            <li> Good price, and nice to have on regular order, never run out!</li>
            <li> I took one star off because these aren&#x27;t as good as the ProSkin cartridges that I normally use.  </li>
            <li> I got this on discount, am I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t pay full</li>
            <li> Good if you like Venus Breeze; i don&#x27;t think it smells any better with the white tea scent (which is fine with me).</li>
            <li> These were a great price so overall</li>
            <li> Fantastic product that does not need to use a separate soap or shaving cream.  </li>
            <li> I feel ok with her using them and not cutting herself.</li>
            <li> They leave your body feeling so silky smooth and with no razor burn or dryness</li>
            <li> smooth shave,</li>
            <li> They make my legs so smooth.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t get any razor burn and legs are silky smooth.</li>
            <li> They smell good and they do not irritate my sensitive.</li>
            <li> I love it to shave all my personal parts, and it very good for your skin and very soft.</li>
            <li> Makes my legs feel nice and soft!!</li>
            <li> When Venus Breeze came out I was soooo excited because they aren&#x27;t as bulky</li>
            <li> First of all, I love my Venus razor.</li>
            <li> Maybe i&#x27;ll stick with the original and use it with shaving cream.</li>
            <li> These have been my favorite razor heads since they first came out.</li>
            <li> What you put on your body is just as significant as what you put in your body.</li>
            <li> This is def my favorite brand of razors - they&#x27;re soft and soothing and get the job done :)</li>
            <li> Comfortable to use, convenient, and quick.  </li>
            <li> The large lotion bumper things make it so there is no accuracy and create more cuts at the ankle and knee.</li>
            <li> I do find that the gel bars can get a bit sticky, but overall these give you a really good shave.  </li>
            <li> I kind of have sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> I just wish they were a bit more reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> Good price when compared to retail, especially when subscribing...</li>
            <li> The soap strips on these razors dissolve so quickly.</li>
            <li> These have a great scent, last a reasonable amount of time</li>
            <li> They go quickly</li>
            <li> they leave my skin incredibly soft and smooth, and I love that I don&#x27;t have to keep reapplying soap or shaving cream when it washes off in the shower.</li>
            <li> , I have to take a shower really quick</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t last long so they&#x27;re not cost effective but very handy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been buying these since they very first came out.</li>
            <li> or two will always buy as long as we can get a good price</li>
            <li> The delivery from Amazon was fast and free, so that&#x27;s a plus too.</li>
            <li> But I got this razor for free and I really like it.  </li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t give a close shave, and you end up shaving more frequently.</li>
            <li> I love these, my skin is so soft after.</li>
            <li> The fact that you get 6 razors is nice because Gillette usually only packages 5 in their boxes.</li>
            <li> Worth the money every time.</li>
            <li> nice gliding with the white tea scent.</li>
            <li> I love how soft these are</li>
            <li> The only ones my wife wants to use, must be good for her.</li>
            <li> The only kind of razor I will use.  </li>
            <li> Exactly what it says and arrived quickly</li>
            <li> Other than that its a good product.</li>
            <li> right.</li>
            <li> Right to your doorstep</li>
            <li> And they are easy to use not messy.</li>
            <li> This is the only brand my Fiance uses and I can agree it makes her legs very smooth.</li>
            <li> 2 more catridges for the same price as 4 of them in the drugstore!</li>
            <li> These are only OK.</li>
            <li> Not so much - I feel like I have a 5 o&#x27;clock shadow every day, and I didn&#x27;t buy into this line of razors to have to contend with stubble!</li>
            <li> Not so much - I feel like I have a 5 o&#x27;clock shadow every day, and I didn&#x27;t buy into this line of razors to have to contend with stubble!</li>
            <li> Even though gel doesn&#x27;t last long, these are great cartridges.</li>
            <li> They are exactly like the ones from the store.</li>
            <li> I absolutely looooooooovvveee these!</li>
            <li> it is the shave I get for the first 3 times.  </li>
            <li> Brand new and shipped quickly.</li>
            <li> I love these because they&#x27;re so easy, and I&#x27;ve become a lazy shaver.</li>
            <li> I have very, very sensitive legs, so I normally pay the extra money to get nice razor heads for my Venus razor.</li>
            <li> and you have super soft legs.</li>
            <li> Just like I normally buy only at a much better price.</li>
            <li> Good product, we won&#x27;t use anything else - they last a long time too.</li>
            <li> Even with the razor brand new right out of the package it does not give a close shave</li>
            <li> I needed some time to get used to the large razor head with the built in shaving cream, but it has turned out to be very convenient.</li>
            <li> but after that, the Shave Gel Bars don&#x27;t do much at all (except get in the way).</li>
            <li> These razors are the only ones that can make my legs smooth when I dont get around to waxing.</li>
            <li> Cheaper than local stores and appears to be genuine Gillette product.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say much for a scent because who cares about that</li>
            <li> Makes shaving so much easier.</li>
            <li> I really like them for taking on vacation; again, because I don&#x27;t need to pack shaving cream</li>
            <li> The strips lather my skin very well</li>
            <li> Multiple blades are nice, but you can get that in a traditional razor.</li>
            <li> So easy to use; they glide up and down my legs, even the back where hair is a bit more course.  </li>
            <li> Love the pink strip on either side of the razor, no need for shave gel!</li>
            <li> but I just happen to notice more cuts compared to other designs.</li>
            <li> /&gt;They&#x27;re great for traveling, since you can just take one slim little razor (plus a refill if you&#x27;re doing a long trip),</li>
            <li> and they last a nice long time too!  </li>
            <li> While the razors are okay, they&#x27;re not worth the money in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I live the subscribe and save price as it is cheaper than buying at Kroger!</li>
            <li> I rarely use them for my legs because the blade is not very wide.</li>
            <li> What these are great for are 1) not cutting yourself, regardless of being a careless shaver, 2) quick shaving (largely because of (1)), and 3) travelling (no shaving cream, which always seems to end up messy during air travel and takes up to much room in my luggage).</li>
            <li> Highly recommended</li>
            <li> Highly recommend</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin and this product has really helped to combat razor burn.</li>
            <li> so your legs are never smooth no matter how many times you go over them with a razor.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t last long, but I love that I don&#x27;t have to use shaving cream.</li>
            <li> Wish i bought more previously!</li>
            <li> To make them last that long…I make sure they stay DRY after each use!</li>
            <li> In other words they help keep me hair free where need be.</li>
            <li> Then I have to throw it away and change a new one.</li>
            <li> These razors are one of those things I can&#x27;t live without.</li>
            <li> At this rate, I&#x27;d much rather take the extra five minutes needed to lather my skin up myself, and return to the Venus Divine cartridges that I like so much.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> There is no need for shaving creme.&lt;br /&gt;They are somewhat pricey but last pretty well.</li>
            <li> also the razor works first stroke to the last of the gel.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re not awful, I definitely still prefer them over other brands, but they&#x27;re probably my least favorite Venus ones.</li>
            <li> I do feel like it is not as close of a shave because the gel bars are &amp;#34;higher&amp;#34; than the blades thus I feel like I have to pressed down harder and go over my pits multiple times to get a good shave.</li>
            <li> the first few times you use it (as long as you make sure to get it wet first),</li>
            <li> Smooth shave with little effort.  </li>
            <li> Finally, I got these refills at a decent price!</li>
            <li> The product is great for shaving legs, armpits or virtually anywhere you are afraid you may cut yourself.  </li>
            <li> This product makes shaving very convenient, but i was resistant to pay an arm and a leg at my local drug store.</li>
            <li> And the stubble may actually be longer!nd return to the Venus Divine cartridges that I like so much.</li>
            <li> I think you will be pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> now.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s very practical and simple, I can always bring it with me when</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not really a huge fan of the razors with the gel bars; in my experience they tend to cause more cuts than the regular Venus razors.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t notice them being any different from the other venus breeze heads, and I really don&#x27;t find there to be a huge difference from one scent to the next.  </li>
            <li> I recently discovered Gillette&#x27;s Venus line of razors (I know, they&#x27;ve only been on the market for a few years now, but I was holding on to an old favorite).</li>
            <li> It surely is convenient but I still only got 2 uses out of the blade before I felt like I was gonna get some serious razor rash.</li>
            <li> Generally, I buy the Olay razors, but I decided to try to switch to these to save some money.</li>
            <li> but since I only used one it may be too early to decide.</li>
            <li> So far Venus Spa is the only razor blade that leaves no bumps in my skin after shaving.</li>
            <li> After that, it&#x27;s basically useless, even if I use my own shave gel</li>
            <li> and they last much longer than I expected.</li>
            <li> I really want to like this product, but it&#x27;s just not worth it.  </li>
            <li> Obscurely enough, these put me in mind of using Mick Jagger&#x27;s mouth to shave - the gel-infused cushions are rubbery and spongy feeling, and as other reviews have stated, keep the razor&#x27;s blades away from your skin, as if you have to push past the \\&quot;lips\\&quot; to get the \\&quot;teeth\\&quot; to scrape the hair away, never very effectively, or if it is effective, it&#x27;s not without great risk of cuts from those self-same blades.</li>
            <li> When it DOES release that gel, it&#x27;s more as a concentrated, thin \\&quot;string\\&quot; of shave gel that never really lathers up properly, and this is with frequent moistening under the shower or tub tap, and after applying generous pressure just to bring the blades in contact with my skin enough to cut any hair.</li>
            <li> As others have said, this is the first Venus cartridge that I&#x27;ve used that has left me with cuts, and worse than that, nowhere near to a close-enough shave, all at a higher price than their other cartridges.</li>
            <li> They do not last as long as a regular razor refill for the mere fact that the &amp;#34;spa&amp;#34; gel eventually wears out before the blade is usually dull, but I accept that because I don&#x27;t have to mess with the shaving cream for a beautiful close shave !</li>
            <li> A normal venus blade works just as well for me, for half the price.  </li>
            <li> The shave gel now barely lasts two shaves, upon using it a third time I was left covered in nicks and cuts due to the lack of shave gel.</li>
            <li> The soap doesn&#x27;t last too long</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if they last as long as I&#x27;d like them to as the conditioning strips seem to fall off prematurely...</li>
            <li> the olay one doesn&#x27;t seem to last as long as the Venus spa does.</li>
            <li> Lets see how long the blades last.</li>
            <li> read all of the reviews for the single packs of Venus Spa cartridges, so I knew that there&#x27;d be a 50/50 shot that I&#x27;d actually like these, but</li>
            <li> Apparently, something other than these Venus Spa refills with the shave gel built</li>
            <li> since we are all aware of the fact that we HAVE to have razor blades, we need to get over the ridiculous prices they charge for them.</li>
            <li> It only has 3 blades, but does the job as expected.</li>
            <li> The thick pink part that lathers wears down quickly and without warning.</li>
            <li> i will never go back to any other razor after experiencing spa breeze.</li>
            <li> The downside of that is that the gel stays gooey if you don&#x27;t let it dry thoroughly, so I try not to pack the razor until I&#x27;ve let it sit out for awhile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, the gel part gets used up long before the razor dulls, so I end up lathering my legs with something else, anyway, and using the razor for a longer period of time rather than throwing it away before it needs to be thrown.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> These were a HUGE disappointment .  </li>
            <li> These are infuriating indispensable in my life.</li>
            <li> However, the soap melts easily, only allowing a few uses, maybe 5.</li>
            <li> On the other hand, the moisture strips make it a little too big to use around your bikini area.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very nice smell and the pink isn&#x27;t terrible.</li>
            <li> these prices were a little less than local stores</li>
            <li> I used to use the regular venus heads (with shaving cream) and also the shick intuition (has built in shave stick) for when I was feeling lazy.  </li>
            <li> Stick with other Venus blades and skip the slimy additions.</li>
            <li> The only reason I take off one star is the small soap attached on the razor fell off every time after about 10-15 uses.</li>
            <li> If you like one of Gillette&#x27;s other types of Venus cartridges, stick with those.</li>
            <li> If you like one of Gillette&#x27;s other types of Venus cartridges, stick with those.</li>
            <li> Got them for every other month delivery for me and my daughter.  </li>
            <li> but she loves these and refuses to use any other.</li>
            <li> Every other razor I&#x27;m tried makes me break out, except this one.</li>
            <li> I used these blades a couple years ago and have since tried other Venus blades.</li>
            <li> Be careful of the ingredients!  </li>
            <li> something that never happens with my other razor.  </li>
            <li> This product is convenient because the cartridges are interchangeable with other Venus handles.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hoping companies like Gillette and other big brands out there can come up with products that are not hazardous to our health.  </li>
            <li> For one, the soap on the razors is extremely slimy for your first few uses, which makes it extremely difficult to get a close shave.</li>
            <li> This is hard to find locally.</li>
            <li> Definitely not worth the money.</li>
            <li> THOSE at least give me a close enough shave that I can skip a day between shaving sessions and not notice the difference.</li>
            <li> THOSE at least give me a close enough shave that I can skip a day between shaving sessions and not notice the difference.</li>
            <li> Certainly Not worth the price.</li>
            <li> I love these, but I hate spending the money.</li>
            <li> I really love using these because I hate having to lather before shaving</li>
            <li> The blades were upside down in the razor...</li>
            <li> I had to use it upside down, if I bought it in a store, I would have returned it.</li>
            <li> always greener on the other side!</li>
            <li> always greener on the other side!</li>
            <li> In fact, I threw half the package away.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been buying these for years at the grocery store and found them for less money here on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I feel like I have less razor-burn with these.</li>
            <li> I can tell very little difference between these and the Breeze - except that these, of course, are pink, and the Breeze are purple.  </li>
            <li> It takes at least twice as long to get a close shave in my underarm area, and even then I feel like I have razor burn once I&#x27;m done.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money!</li>
            <li> Although these are still a little pricey (you don&#x27;t get something for nothing)</li>
            <li> So far, its the only razor that hasn&#x27;t given me a bad razor burn.</li>
            <li> A totally waste.</li>
            <li> My 14 year old loves these razors but they are so expensive.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> ; maybe I just got a bad batch of razor cartridges, but the one that I opened up doesn&#x27;t really release any shave gel until I&#x27;ve moved well beyond a leg or forearm or two.</li>
            <li> But it helps for a lazy person like myself when I don&#x27;t want shaving cream</li>
            <li> I usually order Venus Breeze (not Spa Breeze) and I ordered these because I was in a hurry and at the time I thought that these were cheaper.</li>
            <li> I have been trying to use these for several years, but it&#x27;s getting way too expensive.</li>
            <li> No more shaving cream needed.  </li>
            <li> I usually use the Breezers gave these a chance work just as well</li>
            <li> No more shave gel</li>
            <li> I am obsessed with these and will only use these!</li>
            <li> Not happy with this razor at all, I have to press hard to shave my legs and the life of the blades isn&#x27;t very long.</li>
            <li> I can shave for a week, this seemed dull after two shaves.</li>
            <li> Hard to find sometimes</li>
            <li> The Spa is hard to find so imagine my delight when I saw it at Amazon.  </li>
            <li> This was such a disappointing purchase.</li>
            <li> Coming back to these, I was shocked to find that the size of the shave gel bars has shrunk by about half!</li>
            <li> does mean you don&#x27;t have to use shave gel</li>
            <li> pad above and below it that make getting a close shave nearly impossible.</li>
            <li> the gel cream is a little weird, but I&#x27;m accustomed to the foam.</li>
            <li> These razors gave me such bad razor burn.</li>
            <li> Razor not good.  </li>
            <li> I’ve found these cartridges to be less expensive, which is a plus!</li>
            <li> To thin.  </li>
            <li> Each razor lasts approximately one week, and that is shaving every day.</li>
            <li> I was pressing so hard to get a close shave that I kept cutting myself.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m frustrated to have wasted my money and will not be using the remainder of the blades in the box.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, they do not \\&quot;glide\\&quot; across my skin without the use of gel or soap.</li>
            <li> They are just too expensive.</li>
            <li> They are too expensive at Walgreens, CVS, etc.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very frustrating that these aren&#x27;t made well.</li>
            <li> After I used it a couple times it felt like a dull razor and cut my legs :-(</li>
            <li> I felt so uncomfortable after using these!</li>
            <li> Wish these weren&#x27;t so expensive!</li>
            <li> Bad decision.</li>
            <li> and I have a lot of scars and marks that were caused by bad razors.</li>
            <li> I hate using the razor without the shave bar because then I end up with cuts and razor burn.</li>
            <li> I hate shaving my legs anyway--</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed with these razors.</li>
            <li> Ridiculously awful product!</li>
            <li> Worst razors!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Love the pink strip on either side of the razor, no need for shave gel!</li>
            <li> This is hard to find locally. It is a wonderful treat to have lotion and razors in one. The gym bag is a lot lighter now! LOL!</li>
            <li> Ever since I started using these cartridges, I&#x27;ve never looked back. No need for shaving gel and a perfect, smooth shave. Love these!</li>
            <li> I used to use the regular venus heads (with shaving cream) and also the shick intuition (has built in shave stick) for when I was feeling lazy.  I find the Venus Breeze heads are much better than the intuition heads - the head is smaller so you can get a better shave.  I do find that the gel bars can get a bit sticky, but overall these give you a really good shave.  I&#x27;ve never used the \\&quot;spa\\&quot; breeze but I don&#x27;t notice them being any different from the other venus breeze heads, and I really don&#x27;t find there to be a huge difference from one scent to the next.  These were a great price so overall I would recommend!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Venus razors for a while. This one made my legs itch. Bummer</li>
            <li> The ONLY cartridge I will ever use.</li>
            <li> great price for a really great item i will never go back to any other razor after experiencing spa breeze. love it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not really a huge fan of the razors with the gel bars; in my experience they tend to cause more cuts than the regular Venus razors. I basically just bought these because I was out of razors and these were the cheapest refills with the $6 coupon. They&#x27;re not awful, I definitely still prefer them over other brands, but they&#x27;re probably my least favorite Venus ones. They&#x27;re good at making my legs smooth but I just happen to notice more cuts compared to other designs.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been buying these since they very first came out. I love them even more then the original Venus Breeze.</li>
            <li> Razors are so pricy sometimes. The soap strips on these razors dissolve so quickly. But it helps for a lazy person like myself when I don&#x27;t want shaving cream</li>
            <li> I purchased this here because the price was so much better than buying from a store, will do business with these sellers again.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t smell the scent but it does it&#x27;s job without and nicks or cuts.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed with these razors. I have been using Schick Intuition razors for years and love them. When Venus Breeze came out I was soooo excited because they aren&#x27;t as bulky and I like their Embrace razors. Unfortunately, they do not \\&quot;glide\\&quot; across my skin without the use of gel or soap. They actually do the opposite - THEY STICK!!! I felt so uncomfortable after using these! Razor bumps galore!!! Back to Schick Intuition I go!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t stop buying these. They&#x27;re so great for my skin!</li>
            <li> I usually order Venus Breeze (not Spa Breeze) and I ordered these because I was in a hurry and at the time I thought that these were cheaper. I can tell very little difference between these and the Breeze - except that these, of course, are pink, and the Breeze are purple.  If anything, I do think that the Spa Breeze may require more pressure for a close shave, and I have cut myself a couple of times, which never happened with the Breeze.  Next time, I think I&#x27;ll go back to Breeze just out of habit.</li>
            <li> The cut me! I never cut myself shaving!</li>
            <li> Mom loves these and asked me to order so I got them for me too. It surely is convenient but I still only got 2 uses out of the blade before I felt like I was gonna get some serious razor rash. I may give them all to mom but since I only used one it may be too early to decide.</li>
            <li> Wonderful saving necessity.......</li>
            <li> great to get them at home</li>
            <li> Good price, and nice to have on regular order, never run out!</li>
            <li> My summer legs love this, I can shave very quickly without having to lather my legs up with a separate cream. I live the subscribe and save price as it is cheaper than buying at Kroger! No cuts, or razor burn and have been using this for 2 months underarms and legs, occasionally bikini area.</li>
            <li> https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003EMNITQ/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_25</li>
            <li> So easy to use; they glide up and down my legs, even the back where hair is a bit more course.  Smell great and they last a nice long time too!  I get a couple of weeks out of each refill!</li>
            <li> I would only use venus, it shaves without skin burns.</li>
            <li> The soap doesn&#x27;t last too long but I like it</li>
            <li> Ridiculously awful product!</li>
            <li> these work great and better priced than in store!</li>
            <li> 2 more catridges for the same price as 4 of them in the drugstore! This is def my favorite brand of razors - they&#x27;re soft and soothing and get the job done :)</li>
            <li> First of all, I love my Venus razor. I&#x27;ve been using Venus razors for years. But I thought I&#x27;d give these replacement cartridges a shot because I had a coupon. Bad decision. The &amp;#34;Shave Gel Bars&amp;#34; not only get in the way of a close shave, they get slimy in a heartbeat. It takes at least twice as long to get a close shave in my underarm area, and even then I feel like I have razor burn once I&#x27;m done. It&#x27;s better on the legs, but still not the close shave I expect from Venus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does mean you don&#x27;t have to use shave gel the first few times you use it (as long as you make sure to get it wet first), but after that, the Shave Gel Bars don&#x27;t do much at all (except get in the way). Stick with other Venus blades and skip the slimy additions.</li>
            <li> Smooth shave with little effort.  No shave cream needed!  I&#x27;ve been using this for years.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product that does not need to use a separate soap or shaving cream.  Pleasant scent.</li>
            <li> I love the Venus Spa Breeze. This product makes shaving very convenient, but i was resistant to pay an arm and a leg at my local drug store. I decided to order this from Amazon as well as signing up for the subscription; I now receive these on a monthly basis. No shipping and a great price? Can&#x27;t beat that! I am happy with this purchase. I have not nicked myself since I started using Venus Breeze.</li>
            <li> the soap part falls apart easily</li>
            <li> A close shave every time!</li>
            <li> Brand new and shipped quickly. Best shaver ever.</li>
            <li> Moistening the cartridge head before using creates a soothing film to help avoid nicks and cuts especially on your legs.  There is no need for shaving creme.&lt;br /&gt;They are somewhat pricey but last pretty well.</li>
            <li> These are perfect for a nice close shave.  I feel as if I don&#x27;t have as many nicks,and it helps leave my skin feeling moustirized!</li>
            <li> My wife loves these and won&#x27;t shave with anything else.  Definitely gets pricey buying them at Target, Wal-Mart, etc.  Amazon once again offers a great product at a fantastic price.  Subscribe and save gives you 15% off, but not having to pay taxes (unlike at a regular retailer) increases your savings.</li>
            <li> wife seems to like them,better price than the grocery/drug store</li>
            <li> I like that the shave bars are attached, it&#x27;s a good concept to have but they never stay on after just 2-4 uses. I hate using the razor without the shave bar because then I end up with cuts and razor burn. These are a great idea and I&#x27;ve been using them for years but may discontinue use if the quality doesn&#x27;t hold up.</li>
            <li> Best product I&#x27;ve found ,  for its purpose no nicks and so smooth, cheaper than wa!lys !</li>
            <li> Just like buying at target</li>
            <li> Love these. Great price for the high quality.</li>
            <li> Not happy with this razor at all, I have to press hard to shave my legs and the life of the blades isn&#x27;t very long. After I used it a couple times it felt like a dull razor and cut my legs :-(</li>
            <li> I like all the Gillette razors that have soothing aloe or something that helps you shave instead of purchasing shaving cream. These spa Gillette razorhead refills do the trick and the scent is fine, not too potent. They do have a tendency to form bubbles on the area of the razor where the gel is located - probably do to temperature/climate. Other than that its a good product.</li>
            <li> still my fav razors after years. Add some shaving cream and you have super soft legs.</li>
            <li> my wife loved it we buy this item every month or two will always buy as long as we can get a good price</li>
            <li> The only razors I can use. I just shave with my body wash on and it works great for me.</li>
            <li> The Gillette Venus Spa blades are the best razors for women and you do not need shaving cream with them.</li>
            <li> The best razor I&#x27;ve found by far but WAY OVER PRICED. I think the razor companies are price fixing! $4/ refill cartridge???</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years. The only reason I take off one star is the small soap attached on the razor fell off every time after about 10-15 uses. Then I have to throw it away and change a new one. A totally waste.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten severe razor burn from these blades several times. The thick pink part that lathers wears down quickly and without warning. It also doesn&#x27;t give a close shave, and you end up shaving more frequently. Not worth the money!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t get the hype of this product.  A normal venus blade works just as well for me, for half the price.  I feel that I need to use shaving lotion anyways so the perk of the lather strips don&#x27;t produce.  I really want to like this product, but it&#x27;s just not worth it.  Buy the regular venus blade instead.</li>
            <li> Love Venus Breeze and keep them on my Amazon subscription list.  Comfortable to use, convenient, and quick.  That&#x27;s about all.</li>
            <li> These razors gave me such bad razor burn. It tore up my skin. The large lotion bumper things make it so there is no accuracy and create more cuts at the ankle and knee. I do not recommend. In fact, I threw half the package away.</li>
            <li> These have a great scent, last a reasonable amount of time</li>
            <li> I love that I don&#x27;t have to use shaving gel.  I took one star off because these aren&#x27;t as good as the ProSkin cartridges that I normally use.  But they are still a great product and very convenient to use.</li>
            <li> I have been trying to use these for several years, but it&#x27;s getting way too expensive. So far, its the only razor that hasn&#x27;t given me a bad razor burn. That&#x27;s the only upside to these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can always count on the top moisture bar to fall off after I use it 2 or 3 times, and the bottom one about 5 or 6. It&#x27;s very frustrating that these aren&#x27;t made well. Definitely not worth the money.</li>
            <li> Just what my wife needs!</li>
            <li> These are the best!  Totally eliminates the need for shaving cream and reduces the risk of cuts from shaving.  I am so confident in the Spa razors that when my daughter started shaving her legs [omg], these were the only option for her.  I feel ok with her using them and not cutting herself.</li>
            <li> I have very, very sensitive legs, so I normally pay the extra money to get nice razor heads for my Venus razor. Generally, I buy the Olay razors, but I decided to try to switch to these to save some money. While the razors are okay, they&#x27;re not worth the money in my opinion. For one, the soap on the razors is extremely slimy for your first few uses, which makes it extremely difficult to get a close shave. Once the majority of the soap had come off, I was able to use the razor a bit better, but it still doesn&#x27;t do that great of a job for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save your money, ladies and gentlemen.</li>
            <li> These are only OK. They do work however I find I still need to use shaving cream after a couple weeks.</li>
            <li> I love venus. These razors are the only ones that can make my legs smooth when I dont get around to waxing. The price is better here than anywhere else.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used these for years and this is the best price I&#x27;ve found for them. They make shaving faster and more convenient by not having to use shaving cream.</li>
            <li> These are my favorite Venus blades. They tend to last the longest and keep working. It&#x27;s a very nice smell and the pink isn&#x27;t terrible. Lol.</li>
            <li> No more shaving cream needed.  Love being able to get it on subscription from prime.  The product does a good job.</li>
            <li> These work great.  This is the only brand my Fiance uses and I can agree it makes her legs very smooth.</li>
            <li> Love it and so convenient!</li>
            <li> I would suggest this to anyone who has tried Schick Intuition and liked it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The blades are cheaper in-store and online.&lt;br /&gt;You have more control over where the blade is, as well as visibility.&lt;br /&gt;It curves better to access no-nos and pits!&lt;br /&gt;No more shaving cream.&lt;br /&gt;One word: KNEES.&lt;br /&gt;Close shave for way longer than anything else I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s great. I won&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
            <li> Best razor I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I kept getting cut on these after the soap started wearing away. I wasn&#x27;t cut by the razor part; I was nicked by the plastic attachment that holds the soap. Also, soap disappears at a breakneck pace.</li>
            <li> Been using Gillette Venus razors for some time.  The spa style has a nice scent.  I do notice that when it is time to replace the razor, one or two off the moisturizing bars will fall off - but to me it&#x27;s like a reminder to change razor heads.</li>
            <li> I recently discovered Gillette&#x27;s Venus line of razors (I know, they&#x27;ve only been on the market for a few years now, but I was holding on to an old favorite). Since I loved the Venus Divine blades so much, I thought, \\&quot;what could be better than a razor with built-in shave gel so I don&#x27;t have to lather up my skin?\\&quot;. Apparently, something other than these Venus Spa refills with the shave gel built in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know; maybe I just got a bad batch of razor cartridges, but the one that I opened up doesn&#x27;t really release any shave gel until I&#x27;ve moved well beyond a leg or forearm or two. When it DOES release that gel, it&#x27;s more as a concentrated, thin \\&quot;string\\&quot; of shave gel that never really lathers up properly, and this is with frequent moistening under the shower or tub tap, and after applying generous pressure just to bring the blades in contact with my skin enough to cut any hair. Obscurely enough, these put me in mind of using Mick Jagger&#x27;s mouth to shave - the gel-infused cushions are rubbery and spongy feeling, and as other reviews have stated, keep the razor&#x27;s blades away from your skin, as if you have to push past the \\&quot;lips\\&quot; to get the \\&quot;teeth\\&quot; to scrape the hair away, never very effectively, or if it is effective, it&#x27;s not without great risk of cuts from those self-same blades. Just not well executed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d read all of the reviews for the single packs of Venus Spa cartridges, so I knew that there&#x27;d be a 50/50 shot that I&#x27;d actually like these, but putting them into use for myself solidified it for me. You shouldn&#x27;t have to go through any sort of tutorial or training to effectively use a razor cartridge, and that&#x27;s what I feel like I need to get these to work right. As others have said, this is the first Venus cartridge that I&#x27;ve used that has left me with cuts, and worse than that, nowhere near to a close-enough shave, all at a higher price than their other cartridges. At this rate, I&#x27;d much rather take the extra five minutes needed to lather my skin up myself, and return to the Venus Divine cartridges that I like so much. THOSE at least give me a close enough shave that I can skip a day between shaving sessions and not notice the difference. THESE razor cartridges? Not so much - I feel like I have a 5 o&#x27;clock shadow every day, and I didn&#x27;t buy into this line of razors to have to contend with stubble! If you like one of Gillette&#x27;s other types of Venus cartridges, stick with those. As has been proven to me before, the grass ISN&#x27;T always greener on the other side! And the stubble may actually be longer!nd return to the Venus Divine cartridges that I like so much.

            <li> Nice.  I kind of have sensitive skin.  So far Venus Spa is the only razor blade that leaves no bumps in my skin after shaving.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem as good as store bought...with store bought I can shave for a week, this seemed dull after two shaves. If it happens with the next blade, I&#x27;ll cancel my subscription.</li>
            <li> Razor not good.  To thin.  Would not recommend.  Expecting a much better product from Venus. Certainly Not worth the price.</li>
            <li> Cheaper than local stores and appears to be genuine Gillette product.</li>
            <li> Love these! Got them for every other month delivery for me and my daughter.  Work great, great value!</li>
            <li> Both my wife and daughter use these and I might as well set them up on a subscription basis.  Highly recommended</li>
            <li> Even though gel doesn&#x27;t last long, these are great cartridges.</li>
            <li> Love these and was a fantastic price. They leave your body feeling so silky smooth and with no razor burn or dryness</li>
            <li> Simply a good price for razors. If you already use these, you know what you&#x27;re getting. I like the moisture bars on both sides and it indicates when to replace the razor when those wear.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say much for a scent because who cares about that but they work well.  I don&#x27;t know if they last as long as I&#x27;d like them to as the conditioning strips seem to fall off prematurely...</li>
            <li> Great Product would highly recommend it to you anyone who shaves there legs.</li>
            <li> I love these because they&#x27;re so easy, and I&#x27;ve become a lazy shaver. However, the gel part gets used up long before the razor dulls, so I end up lathering my legs with something else, anyway, and using the razor for a longer period of time rather than throwing it away before it needs to be thrown.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They&#x27;re great for traveling, since you can just take one slim little razor (plus a refill if you&#x27;re doing a long trip), and in two swipes you can do your underarms. The downside of that is that the gel stays gooey if you don&#x27;t let it dry thoroughly, so I try not to pack the razor until I&#x27;ve let it sit out for awhile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll keep using these. Multiple blades are nice, but you can get that in a traditional razor. For the price, and for the short period of time the gel part lasts, I might as well go back to traditional razors.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t use another razor blade. Makes shaving so much easier.</li>
            <li> Like this product. Good value.</li>
            <li> I usually use the Breezers gave these a chance work just as well</li>
            <li> My 14 year old loves these razors but they are so expensive. The breakdown at Walmart is $4.50 a piece. Amazon has them for $3.50 each so we bought them. They are perfect for the teenager who doesn&#x27;t pay a lot of attention to what she&#x27;s doing. They don&#x27;t last long so they&#x27;re not cost effective but very handy. For someone who likes it all in one this is the perfect product.</li>
            <li> I love these, my skin is so soft after. They go quickly but it&#x27;s something you should be able to treat yourself on.</li>
            <li> Why are they not being sold anymore?! They are the best and all I use! Wish i bought more previously!</li>
            <li> I like them because you do not have to use shaving cream. And they are easy to use not messy. They are a lot easier to use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been buying these for years at the grocery store and found them for less money here on Amazon. They are exactly like the ones from the store.</li>
            <li> Finally, I got these refills at a decent price!</li>
            <li> Hard to find sometimes but she loves these and refuses to use any other. Makes shaving a breeze she says!</li>
            <li> the olay one doesn&#x27;t seem to last as long as the Venus spa does. also the razor works first stroke to the last of the gel.</li>
            <li> I love not having to use shaving cream anymore when I shave. I just wish they were a bit more reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> Exactly what it says and arrived quickly</li>
            <li> Worst razors! Don&#x27;t waste your money. Spend the extra to get the 5 blade cartridges. Even with the razor brand new right out of the package it does not give a close shave so your legs are never smooth no matter how many times you go over them with a razor.</li>
            <li> These razors reduced my shaving time dramatically.  Instead of shaving a couple times a week, I can shave every day.  The coating and blades last about 2 weeks.  Toward the last couple uses, I do need to use soap to lub my legs up.</li>
            <li> Every other razor I&#x27;m tried makes me break out, except this one. I love it.  If shaving makes you break out, then try this one.  I think you will be pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> This was such a disappointing purchase. I used these blades a couple years ago and have since tried other Venus blades. Coming back to these, I was shocked to find that the size of the shave gel bars has shrunk by about half! The shave gel now barely lasts two shaves, upon using it a third time I was left covered in nicks and cuts due to the lack of shave gel. I&#x27;m frustrated to have wasted my money and will not be using the remainder of the blades in the box.</li>
            <li> Love these - close shave and great price on Amazon!</li>
            <li> My wife and Daughter both love these - what more is there to say?</li>
            <li> I just love these refills because I don&#x27;t have to apply shaving cream and then shave -its all-in-one ! They do not last as long as a regular razor refill for the mere fact that the &amp;#34;spa&amp;#34; gel eventually wears out before the blade is usually dull, but I accept that because I don&#x27;t have to mess with the shaving cream for a beautiful close shave !</li>
            <li> I love these razors...they give a lovely close shave. I don&#x27;t use any shave cream with and have never had a problem. The delivery from Amazon was fast and free, so that&#x27;s a plus too.</li>
            <li> Much better than running to the store all the time for the wife.</li>
            <li> These were a HUGE disappointment .  The razor has an enormous (soap?) pad above and below it that make getting a close shave nearly impossible. I was pressing so hard to get a close shave that I kept cutting myself.  I finally cut off the soap pads entirely.  Do not buy!</li>
            <li> I use these for my underarms. The built-in moisture strip saves me from having to use shaving cream. I feel like I have less razor-burn with these. I really like them for taking on vacation; again, because I don&#x27;t need to pack shaving cream and I can use these to shave every day or every-othe day without razor burn. I like the scents they come in. I rarely use them for my legs because the blade is not very wide. On the other hand, the moisture strips make it a little too big to use around your bikini area.</li>
            <li> The price on these is perfect and so much cheaper than buying them at the store. The fact that you get 6 razors is nice because Gillette usually only packages 5 in their boxes.</li>
            <li> Good if you like Venus Breeze; i don&#x27;t think it smells any better with the white tea scent (which is fine with me). I do feel like it is not as close of a shave because the gel bars are &amp;#34;higher&amp;#34; than the blades thus I feel like I have to pressed down harder and go over my pits multiple times to get a good shave. Maybe i&#x27;ll stick with the original and use it with shaving cream.</li>
            <li> I love these because they have soap and moisturizer all in one. And when the soap has been used up, it&#x27;s time to throw it away.</li>
            <li> I needed some time to get used to the large razor head with the built in shaving cream, but it has turned out to be very convenient.</li>
            <li> I love these razors because razor burn never happens to me anymore! The price is good too.</li>
            <li> I love these, but I hate spending the money. They are just too expensive. And they don&#x27;t give the closest shave ever, If you are looking to avoid the former along with the latter, I recommend checking out dollarshaveclub.com. What these are great for are 1) not cutting yourself, regardless of being a careless shaver, 2) quick shaving (largely because of (1)), and 3) travelling (no shaving cream, which always seems to end up messy during air travel and takes up to much room in my luggage). These are infuriating indispensable in my life.</li>
            <li> These have been my favorite razor heads since they first came out. they leave my skin incredibly soft and smooth, and I love that I don&#x27;t have to keep reapplying soap or shaving cream when it washes off in the shower. I&#x27;ve never had any scrapes or nicks while using these. They smell good and they do not irritate my sensitive. Worth the money every time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these razors for years now and I absolutely love them. Venus Breeze razors are the only brand I can use that won&#x27;t irritate my skin. I have very sensitive skin and I have a lot of scars and marks that were caused by bad razors. This is the only brand that doesn&#x27;t give me any bumps and I love how moisturizing it is. The strips lather my skin very well and I&#x27;ve never needed to use any shaving creams or gels with these razors. When I was living abroad for a while, I had to have them shipped out to me. These razors are one of those things I can&#x27;t live without.</li>
            <li> These razors have changed my life! No more shave gel and I&#x27;ve &amp;#34;shaved&amp;#34; minutes off of my shower routine.</li>
            <li> Wish these weren&#x27;t so expensive! The blades themselves are great though!</li>
            <li> Three daughters plus me, and we all shave...legs, underarms.....smooth shave, nice gliding with the white tea scent. Although these are still a little pricey (you don&#x27;t get something for nothing) it beats buying them in the stores. Good product, we won&#x27;t use anything else - they last a long time too.</li>
            <li> I love it to shave all my personal parts, and it very good for your skin and very soft.Love it.</li>
            <li> I love this product been using it for many years now.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s very practical and simple, I can always bring it with me when traveling.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have to buy shaving cream and having extra can laying around in the bathroom.</li>
            <li> My favorite razor is the Venus.  The Spa is hard to find so imagine my delight when I saw it at Amazon.  Sometimes I am amazed at the items I am able to find.  I have been using the Venus system for over 5 years now and I love it.</li>
            <li> I never buy women&#x27;s shavers because I think they use cheaper blades on them then men&#x27;s.  So I have always bought Mens.  But I got this razor for free and I really like it.  Go figure.  Lets see how long the blades last.</li>
            <li> Makes my legs feel nice and soft!! Highly recommend</li>
            <li> These are my favorite razor blades.  They make your legs feel so smooth!</li>
            <li> Good deal. No Problems.</li>
            <li> Be careful of the ingredients!  PEG compounds such as PEG-115M; PEG-7M; PEG-100, all listed in this product, can be contaminated with 1,4-dioxane, which may cause cancer.    Read more about toxic chemicals to avoid in beauty products here:    http://www.davidsuzuki.org/issues/health/science/toxics/dirty-dozen-cosmetic-chemicals/    I&#x27;m hoping companies like Gillette and other big brands out there can come up with products that are not hazardous to our health.  Especially when you are shaving your legs!  What you put on your body is just as significant as what you put in your body. Your skin is the largest organ of your body and since it is porous, it absorbs whatever you put on it.</li>
            <li> way cheaper than buying them at the store!! I am obsessed with these and will only use these!</li>
            <li> I have been using GIllette Venus Spa blades for years.  They are too expensive at Walgreens, CVS, etc. so I decided to get them on Amazon &amp;#34;Subscribe and Save&amp;#34; and it&#x27;s working out.  The product is great for shaving legs, armpits or virtually anywhere you are afraid you may cut yourself.  Each blade last about a month if you shave once a day.  To make them last that long…I make sure they stay DRY after each use!</li>
            <li> since we are all aware of the fact that we HAVE to have razor blades, we need to get over the ridiculous prices they charge for them. these prices were a little less than local stores</li>
            <li> These are my favorite. They smell amazing and are so easy to use. I will always recommend these to everyone.</li>
            <li> I absolutely looooooooovvveee these! They smell great, and glide smoothly. It only has 3 blades, but does the job as expected. A new razor lasts me about two months before I feel like I have to replace it, and that works perfectly for me. I don&#x27;t use any other shaving cream or gel, because the bars work excellently. I would definitely buy again!</li>
            <li> I love these razor heads, as I do not have to use any shaving cream. However, the soap melts easily, only allowing a few uses, maybe 5.</li>
            <li> The blades were upside down in the razor... I had to use it upside down, if I bought it in a store, I would have returned it.</li>
            <li> The only type of shaver that doesn&#x27;t mutilate my legs. &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> I really love using these because I hate having to lather before shaving and they last much longer than I expected.</li>
            <li> I love how soft these are and I never have to use cream with them. I only wish they were still selling the case you could put in the shower to hold an extra 2 cartridges.</li>
            <li> I love my Venus Breeze razor, but the cartridge refills are stinking expensive.  This is the best price I&#x27;ve found!!</li>
            <li> The only ones my wife wants to use, must be good for her. Good price and quick shipping</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t last long, but I love that I don&#x27;t have to use shaving cream.</li>
            <li> Just like I normally buy only at a much better price.</li>
            <li> Right to your doorstep</li>
            <li> I got this on discount, am I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t pay full price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I like about it is the shave I get for the first 3 times.  After that, it&#x27;s basically useless, even if I use my own shave gel I get razor burn and cuts, something that never happens with my other razor.  I am going to back to the 5 blade Embrace, it&#x27;s much better.</li>
            <li> The only kind of razor I will use.  I hate shaving my legs anyway--I&#x27;m a mom, I have to take a shower really quick but these make the job a lot easier and faster!</li>
            <li> Love these razors! I no longer have to purchase shaving cream! They make my legs so smooth. Each razor lasts approximately one week, and that is shaving every day. If you do not shave every day then they will easily last weeks.</li>
            <li> The best. Never have a problem and when in use they reach where I need to go. In other words they help keep me hair free where need be.</li>
            <li> These are some of the best razors I have ever used!!! I don&#x27;t get any razor burn and legs are silky smooth.</li>
            <li> Good price when compared to retail, especially when subscribing...</li>
            <li> the best razor out there for women</li>
            <li> I love these with the built in soothing strips. I love not having to use soap or cream. I don&#x27;t have a problem with nicks or cuts. These last quite a while too.</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin and this product has really helped to combat razor burn. I prefer to use the Gillette Venus &amp; Olay Refill Cartridges, but these are a close second! I’ve found these cartridges to be less expensive, which is a plus! This product is convenient because the cartridges are interchangeable with other Venus handles. I’ll continue to purchase these refills again and again.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s good. the gel cream is a little weird, but I&#x27;m accustomed to the foam.</li>
