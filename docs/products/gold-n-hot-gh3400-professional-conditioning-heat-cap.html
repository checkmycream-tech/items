    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>excellent and works well</li>
            <li>Good luck!</li>
            <li>Product was great.</li>
            <li>I do get great heat from mine.  </li>
            <li>There is another brand that a friend of mine had and it heated up very nice.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s best to use it for more than 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>and I know the conditioning cap holds some good heat so these two combos worked for me.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Good purchase.</li>
            <li>I was very pleased with it.</li>
            <li>UL Warns of Potentially Hazardous Heat Cap (google it).</li>
            <li>I had it on the highest setting and it was barely warm.</li>
            <li>guess if you just want your heat cap luke warm on its highest setting</li>
            <li>and I love that it has three heat settings.  </li>
            <li>I have a conditioning cap but the more I used that cap</li>
            <li>the more worn out it&#x27;s getting.  </li>
            <li>then I guess this would be okay for you.</li>
            <li>The product is okay.</li>
            <li>The oil mix I made of coconut, jojoba, and olive oil just sits on top of my hair and doesn&#x27;t penetrate the pore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>cap does fit kind of funky though.  </li>
            <li>You could use a plastic cap and a dryer but this warms without the noise :)</li>
            <li>Love treating my hair with this.</li>
            <li>Cons could get better heat.</li>
            <li>I was going to try the steam dryer, but I&#x27;ve been hearing that&#x27;s more ideal for low porosity hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other caps, but this is the best!</li>
            <li>This is a good product , I love Hot and Gold products I&#x27;ve used their electric straightening combs, but this dryer dosent get hot at all</li>
            <li>This hot cap is so warm and comfortable I can sit and watch tv while my hair is being treated</li>
            <li>Works great for deep conditioning at home.</li>
            <li>This heat cap is great for deep conditioning</li>
            <li>However, 30 to 45 minutes under this cap when I have the time gives me a far superior result.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use and well worth the nominal expense.  </li>
            <li>I just used it last night for a hot oil treatment and it works great.</li>
            <li>Good for deep conditioning.  </li>
            <li>Since I&#x27;m in the type 4 natural category I will eventually have to put moisturizers in my hair but this heating cap is pretty good for me.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t get too hot and easy to use.</li>
            <li>Save your money it fits very comfortably but it dosent get hot , If it got hot it would be the bomb but its not.</li>
            <li>Like I stated in my headline, my first use of this cap has me pretty much satisfied.</li>
            <li>and it works as well as it did the very first day I purchased it.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I set it on medium and boy did it get hot!  </li>
            <li>well worth it.  </li>
            <li>This heating cap gets exceptionally warm enough to get the job done.  </li>
            <li>This doesn&#x27;t heat up to a high heat and the cap doesnt fit well.</li>
            <li>If the first digit in the date code starts with the number \\&quot;3\\&quot; then your product is included in this notice.    </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t want to keep heating my conditioner, running my face towel through hot water and placing it over my hair and then putting the conditioning cap over it every time I wash my hair.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It does not get hot at all.  </li>
            <li>It was disconcerting when I first got it, but now I&#x27;m pretty accustomed to it.  </li>
            <li>I literally bought my Gold N Hot heat cap in 2003.</li>
            <li>I love to deep condition.  </li>
            <li>Overall I am satisfied with the heating cap I purchased.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t get it because I have owned this Gold n Hot Heat Cap for almost five years</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t even imagine what the high setting feels like!  </li>
            <li>It gets the job done very well.</li>
            <li>Pros very portable and compact for persons who does there hair at home.</li>
            <li>I just purchased this exact product at sally&#x27;s for my hot oil and deep conditioning</li>
            <li>It starts out at a decent temperature and than it does not get any hotter.  </li>
            <li>I let it heat up for maybe 20 minutes, sit under it for at least 30 minutes and my head stays warm the whole time.</li>
            <li>Even if you put it on high, the highest it can get is lukewarm.</li>
            <li>so I decided to give it a shot because I think I have high porosity hair.</li>
            <li>but, this cap makes a huge difference in how Wen, homemade, and all other my treatments come out.  </li>
            <li>It warms nicely if you have the time to deep condition for a few hours.</li>
            <li>I purchased one from a regular store for my first day of my hair journey.</li>
            <li>It has been my &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; when I want something extra special or feel I need to do intensive treatments for various reasons.  </li>
            <li>Using heat on my hair colors makes them last a very, very long time: I use semi-permanent hair colors and they can last 6 months or more.</li>
            <li>These Professional Condition Heat Caps may overheat during use, posing a burn hazard.    </li>
            <li>My hair is air drying as we speak and it is soft.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Although the product did leave my hair short of soft, that was only certain sections of my hair.</li>
            <li>Heat for deep conditioning helps the conditioner penetrate, leaving my hair very soft and strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;It gets very hot on the high setting, so I usually use it on medium or low.</li>
            <li>This unit barely heats up, if at all.</li>
            <li>It also has an empty spot in the back where it does not get hot at all.</li>
            <li>This particular conditioning cap does not really heat  up well if at all.</li>
            <li>I sometimes have to turn it down from high to medium.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
    </ol>

            <li> At first I found that a little alarming, but no harm has ever come of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It has so little heat even on high, so as not to function at all.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> familiar with the Gold N&#x27; Hot hair line and even though I&#x27;m not really a fan of their flat irons and curling irons that people have broken within a few uses I decided to give this a try.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The cord is actually longer than expected</li>
            <li> I see there are a lot of inconsistencies in the reviews of this product.  </li>
            <li> The heat is also not ideal for me as I have SUPER THICK hair and need quite a bit of heat for conditioning.</li>
            <li> You will need to use the drawstring strap to keep it down on your head well.  </li>
            <li> The aluminum is wearing off but it still keeps my head a little heated.  </li>
            <li> Try that for your treatments ladies, and don&#x27;t waste your time with this so called heating cap.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Please don&#x27;t waste you money on this heating cap</li>
            <li> Its a waste of money pick another brand.</li>
            <li> I lost that a few years ago so now I use a few plastic grocery bags.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s non messy.</li>
            <li> This is not bad, it is much worse than bad because it is unstable in operation</li>
            <li> and I suspect that it is not safe to use.</li>
            <li> Even still, it fits weird, but it&#x27;s only for 30-45 minutes and</li>
            <li> cap came with a small, thin plastic cap to use underneath it, to protect it from getting wet or sticky or stained.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s late at night when I wash my hair.  </li>
            <li> Sometimes I just sleep in my treatment with a conditioning cap and turbie twist over it if I am tired</li>
            <li> works but it fits on head weird and is cumbersome.</li>
            <li> Disappointing.</li>
            <li> I must say what a disappointment.  </li>
            <li> will try to re-sell it to someone as a once-used product.&lt;br /&gt;Very bad.</li>
            <li> The shape can be annoying.</li>
            <li> you will be very disappointed.  </li>
            <li> It might not be the cheapest one out there, but it is (certainlu) among the worst.</li>
            <li> Awful.</li>

            <li> Works great for deep conditioning at home. Doesn&#x27;t get too hot and easy to use.</li>
            <li> I purchased one from a regular store for my first day of my hair journey. This unit barely heats up, if at all. Disappointing.</li>
            <li> This heat cap is great for deep conditioning and I love that it has three heat settings.  Easy to use and well worth the nominal expense.  I&#x27;ve tried other caps, but this is the best!</li>
            <li> This cap does not heat properly. Even if you put it on high, the highest it can get is lukewarm. I am planning to return it because it definitely does not work.</li>

            <li> I came across a tip about heating up your conditioner and leaving it in your hair for 30 minutes.  I have a conditioning cap but the more I used that cap the more worn out it&#x27;s getting.  The aluminum is wearing off but it still keeps my head a little heated.  I didn&#x27;t want to keep heating my conditioner, running my face towel through hot water and placing it over my hair and then putting the conditioning cap over it every time I wash my hair.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m familiar with the Gold N&#x27; Hot hair line and even though I&#x27;m not really a fan of their flat irons and curling irons that people have broken within a few uses I decided to give this a try.&lt;br /&gt;I put conditioner in my hair placed my conditioning cap over my head and then the heating cap.  I had to fumble with these two a bit.  I didn&#x27;t want to soil my cap and I know the conditioning cap holds some good heat so these two combos worked for me.&lt;br /&gt;I set it on medium and boy did it get hot!  I had to switch it to low!  I can&#x27;t even imagine what the high setting feels like!  My hair is air drying as we speak and it is soft.  Since I&#x27;m in the type 4 natural category I will eventually have to put moisturizers in my hair but this heating cap is pretty good for me.  It cooked the conditioner through my hair which means this conditioner will do what it states and if it does that then this cap is alright with me.  Like I stated in my headline, my first use of this cap has me pretty much satisfied.</li>
            <li> I purchased this at a beauty supply store and I was mega-disappointed. This is not bad, it is much worse than bad because it is unstable in operation and I suspect that it is not safe to use. It starts and stops. It does not heat evenly. It might not be the cheapest one out there, but it is (certainlu) among the worst. No pro&#x27;s. All con&#x27;s. Awful.</li>
            <li> This product took about two weeks to arrive. Product was great. It comes actually the way it is displayed on the site. I was very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> I just purchased this exact product at sally&#x27;s for my hot oil and deep conditioning treatments.&lt;br /&gt;I plugged it in so it would heat up while I was putting my oil in my hair.... took about 10 minutes. I had it on the highest setting and it was barely warm. I&#x27;m returning it tomorrow. There is another brand that a friend of mine had and it heated up very nice. It was the thermal spa one. Try that for your treatments ladies, and don&#x27;t waste your time with this so called heating cap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess if you just want your heat cap luke warm on its highest setting then I guess this would be okay for you.</li>
            <li> It has so little heat even on high, so as not to function at all.&lt;br /&gt;I will try to re-sell it to someone as a once-used product.&lt;br /&gt;Very bad.</li>
            <li> I purchased this heating cap sometime ago.  I must say what a disappointment.  It does not get hot at all.  It starts out at a decent temperature and than it does not get any hotter.  Please don&#x27;t waste you money on this heating cap you will be very disappointed.  It also has an empty spot in the back where it does not get hot at all.</li>
            <li> The product is okay. I heard about other natural haired women raving about it so I decided to give it a shot because I think I have high porosity hair. The oil mix I made of coconut, jojoba, and olive oil just sits on top of my hair and doesn&#x27;t penetrate the pore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although the product did leave my hair short of soft, that was only certain sections of my hair. It didn&#x27;t get to all of my hair. It especially missed the hair closer to my neck. The heat is also not ideal for me as I have SUPER THICK hair and need quite a bit of heat for conditioning. I was going to try the steam dryer, but I&#x27;ve been hearing that&#x27;s more ideal for low porosity hair. I think I&#x27;ll just put on a shower cap/plastic bag, get a hooded dryer, and call it day. That always seemed to work for me when I used to go to the hair salon.</li>
            <li> excellent and works well</li>
            <li> works but it fits on head weird and is cumbersome.</li>
            <li> This particular conditioning cap does not really heat  up well if at all. Its a waste of money pick another brand.</li>

I really don&#x27;t get it because I have owned this Gold n Hot Heat Cap for almost five years and it works as well as it did the very first day I purchased it.  I use it for deep conditioning as well as deep moisturizing with various oils.  It has been my &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; when I want something extra special or feel I need to do intensive treatments for various reasons.  I use the Wen products fairly regularly and they work well alone but, this cap makes a huge difference in how Wen, homemade, and all other my treatments come out.  Sometimes I just sleep in my treatment with a conditioning cap and turbie twist over it if I am tired and it&#x27;s late at night when I wash my hair.  However, 30 to 45 minutes under this cap when I have the time gives me a far superior result.  My hair comes out so silky and lustrous.  My hair is type 3b.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cap does fit kind of funky though.  You will need to use the drawstring strap to keep it down on your head well.  Even still, it fits weird, but it&#x27;s only for 30-45 minutes and well worth it.  I also hear these clunky clicking noises when I&#x27;m using mine.  It was disconcerting when I first got it, but now I&#x27;m pretty accustomed to it.  I&#x27;m thinking perhaps it is a thermostat type thing that kicks in and keeps it from overheating.  I do get great heat from mine.  I sometimes have to turn it down from high to medium.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, I hope this helps someone.  Good luck!</li>
            <li> It warms nicely if you have the time to deep condition for a few hours. It&#x27;s not a dryer dome, so I don&#x27;t expect it to heat up to blazing temps. You could use a plastic cap and a dryer but this warms without the noise :)</li>
            <li> I literally bought my Gold N Hot heat cap in 2003. I just used it last night for a hot oil treatment and it works great. I use this cap for coloring my hair and for deep conditioning treatments. Using heat on my hair colors makes them last a very, very long time: I use semi-permanent hair colors and they can last 6 months or more. Heat for deep conditioning helps the conditioner penetrate, leaving my hair very soft and strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My cap came with a small, thin plastic cap to use underneath it, to protect it from getting wet or sticky or stained. I lost that a few years ago so now I use a few plastic grocery bags.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It gets very hot on the high setting, so I usually use it on medium or low. It gets the job done very well. I&#x27;ve worn it for hours at a time with no problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes it makes a buzzing noise. At first I found that a little alarming, but no harm has ever come of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product to all my friends. It is a game-changer in hair care.</li>
            <li> I love to deep condition.  This heating cap gets exceptionally warm enough to get the job done.  It&#x27;s quiet so that you can watch television while you wait and it&#x27;s non messy.</li>
            <li> Love treating my hair with this. This hot cap is so warm and comfortable I can sit and watch tv while my hair is being treated and it&#x27;s completely silent so no interference. The cord is actually longer than expected so there&#x27;s definitely wiggle room.</li>
            <li> Invest in one that is more expensive. This doesn&#x27;t heat up to a high heat and the cap doesnt fit well.</li>
            <li> Good for deep conditioning.  It&#x27;s best to use it for more than 15 minutes.</li>
            <li> I purchased the pictured heating cap over 5 years ago from a beauty supply store and I like it. I let it heat up for maybe 20 minutes, sit under it for at least 30 minutes and my head stays warm the whole time. It gets the conditioning process done for me. The shape can be annoying. Overall I am satisfied with the heating cap I purchased.</li>
            <li> Well let me just say it does the job. Pros very portable and compact for persons who does there hair at home. Cons could get better heat. Especially at the crown. Overall it works and does the job if you can&#x27;t afford a salon hooded dryer.</li>
            <li> Good purchase. Easier to use than a hair dryer bonnet.</li>
            <li> This is a good product , I love Hot and Gold products I&#x27;ve used their electric straightening combs, but this dryer dosent get hot at all and the manufactures dont specifye the heating tempratures or the degrees of heat .  Save your money it fits very comfortably but it dosent get hot , If it got hot it would be the bomb but its not. Brown Sugar from N.y</li>
            <li> No calienta lo suficiente.&lt;br /&gt;No lo recomiendo.</li>
