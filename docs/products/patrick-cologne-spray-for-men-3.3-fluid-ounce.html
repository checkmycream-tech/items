            <li>he loved it:)</li>
            <li>Great company that shipped it, got it fast and packed great.</li>
            <li>Nicely scented cologne, smells rather woodsy and like a fir tree.</li>
            <li>I have no idea if the person liked it or not.</li>
            <li>Not something that very many would find appealing.</li>
            <li>Great price and delivered quickly.</li>
            <li>Shipped quickly and a great price&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li>The store closed where I used to get this cologne, so I was very happy to find it at a good price and it arrived so quickly.&lt;br /&gt;5</li>
            <li>A nice strong manly scent.</li>
            <li>I was told that this was a nice, refreshing scent, but it is waaaaaaaaay too strong and overpowering for my taste.</li>
            <li>I get more compliments on how it smells from others.</li>
            <li>and I love that.</li>
            <li>When it runs out I will be purchasing more.</li>
            <li>My favorite cologne.</li>
            <li>He has declared this his favorite cologne of all time.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>

            <li>Fast delivery and the fragrance smells great.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s his favorite scent.  </li>
            <li>Became acquainted with it while in Ireland many years ago and still love the fragrance</li>
            <li>and I love the way he smells.  </li>
            <li>One of my favorite fragrances for all day wear.</li>
            <li>I have had many compliments on the fragrance.</li>
            <li>like- a lot better fragrances out there.</li>
            <li>and I have received many compliments on it even after having worn it for hours.</li>
            <li>Love the scent.</li>
            <li>and we love it.  </li>
            <li>I know two people that wear this cologne, both receive many compliments on it.</li>
            <li>Nice and light but still manly.</li>
            <li>We were in Ireland last April and saw this cologne on sale there - we meant to grab some and didn&#x27;t, so we were so happy to find it online!  </li>
            <li>I love</li>
            <li>Will surely want to always have a supply on hand.</li>
            <li>Thje fragrance is lovely.</li>
            <li>The shipping was very fast and the product came in good condition.</li>
            <li>Not too strong or overpowering, but that reflects his exotic and outdoorsy personality.  </li>
            <li>This is a great masculine scent that truly reminds us of the magical trip we got to have.</li>
            <li>Thank god it is becoming easier to find.</li>
            <li>I like it, and more importantly, the ladies seem to like it.  </li>
            <li>Smells so good, very manly...</li>
            <li>Its not overpowering and because it&#x27;s not found all over its more unique.</li>
            <li>my mom bought this fro me for my birthday!!i love the clean smell of it...</li>
            <li>Good for someone who likes more natural scents.</li>
            <li>There is a strong scent of greenery (guessing from ferns).</li>
            <li>I found this cologne while traveling and liked it very much, my wife and daughter also like it.  </li>
            <li>My husband has liked this scent since I bought it or him on our first trip to Ireland in  2004.</li>
            <li>This cologne is very clean and mild fragrance.  </li>
            <li>This makes a nice gift - it&#x27;s unusual and you can&#x27;t find it everywhere - it&#x27;s imported from Ireland.</li>
            <li>The scent is not what I was expecting, but I enjoy it nonetheless.</li>
            <li>and I actually enjoy it myself.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad that I&#x27;ve found it here at a consistent price.  </li>
            <li>This was originally ordered for someone else as a gift, however they changed their mind before it arrived</li>
            <li>This smells amazing almost like Irish Springs but more.</li>
            <li>I knew the more mainstream colognes would be too much</li>
            <li>Really nice and masculine fragrance.</li>
            <li>unusual that they don&#x27;t make one, most men&#x27;s products give you a choice.  </li>
            <li>Clean, fresh, and unique.  </li>
            <li>This men&#x27;s cologne has the right balance: it is not too overpowering, and it is not too light.</li>
            <li>It is a bit strong at first, but you get used to it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The product has a fresh clean smell that others seem to like.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This is a good cologne; we got it for my 15 year old brother who is a boy scout, and he really likes it.</li>
            <li>Now we can enjoy the scent, and not pay way too much!</li>
            <li>EXACTLY what I wanted!    </li>
            <li>It is a classic men&#x27;s type of fragrance yet still smells modern, clean, and refreshing.</li>
            <li>it has amazing lasting power</li>
            <li>bottom line is I really like this cologne and would recommend it to anyone looking for a light, fresh scent.</li>
            <li>Not overpowering and great for everyday use.</li>
            <li>The scent is very mysterious and rugged in an Irishy kind of way...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice to have a regular scent that does not get lost amongst what everyone else is wearing.</li>
            <li>I rarely wear cologne</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not heavy or cloying and the scent lasts many hours.</li>
            <li>Clean, fresh and somewhat lasting.  Not an overwhelming fragrance.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not like the dozens of perfumes that all smell alike and really has a unique aroma.</li>
            <li>It stands out for the other ones out there in a good way.</li>
            <li>when my man wears this I just want to jump on him right then and there.</li>
            <li>GREAT INITIAL SMELL, BUT DISAPPEARS AFTER A SHORT TIME.  </li>
            <li>The first time I ran out, it took 6 months to locate.</li>
            <li>Buying online from Amazon and other places advertised on Amazon is much better!</li>
            <li>Is exactly as the box describes:  </li>
            <li>I love that it appeals to my earthy sensibilities and doesn&#x27;t smell too urban.</li>
            <li>Husband finished first bottle of colonge from our 2008 honeymoon in October.  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t able to smell it but judging from the recipient&#x27;s reaction it was a big hit!</li>
            <li>This is the first cologne I ever bought for my boyfriend when we first started dating 10 years ago.</li>
            <li>You can definitely smell the oak moss as the top note though.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it , I purchased Patrick in Ireland over 20 years ago.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Smells like a Nursing home filled with musky 80 years plus old men.  </li>
            <li>It is still my personal favorite.</li>
            <li>but this was exactly how I imagined the earthy aroma.  </li>
            <li>;-)</li>
            <li>This is a good, traditional, male scented cologne.</li>
            <li>Probably would smell good with a sweater on next to a fire with your babe next to you.  </li>
            <li>Reminiscent of the old favorite classic that your dad wore (you know the one !), but has a more modern classy feel.</li>
            <li>People have commented positively about the scent.&lt;br /&gt;It is not overpowering.  </li>
            <li>smells for pretty much ever cologne out there.</li>
            <li>the scent of the cologne is not too strong and i got several positive  compliments on it</li>
            <li>My boyfriend is a loyal old spice guy</li>
            <li>Very clever.</li>
            <li>I first saw and smelled it at a great little Irish store in Austin, TX.</li>
            <li>I will certainly order this again from Amazon for my dad.</li>
            <li>It smells very woodsy.  </li>
            <li>It seems to be a very subjective smell.</li>
            <li>I really like it quite a bit.</li>
            <li>Words don&#x27;t really convey smells very well, haha.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>really like Man of Aran cologne a lot</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t really.</li>
            <li>I really like this fragrance.  </li>
            <li>I really like the scent.  </li>
            <li>wife really likes it.  </li>
            <li>Patrick is a warm smelling cologne that is just different enough for others to notice and comment on without being over powering.  </li>
            <li>The scents of moss and pine are probably the most prevalent for me and the overall vibe for me is just natural and Earthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would recommend purchasing to any man wanting a unique style of smelling different from the rest.</li>
            <li>you can order a sample of this and their other cologne to be sure you like it.</li>
            <li>One note of particular is that it does seem to wear off fast, not sure if this is just my nose becoming attenuated or it dissipates quickly.</li>
            <li>I bought it blind based on reviews and couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.</li>
            <li>Reactions to it have been very positive, from it smells woodsy and rough to it smells like freshly cleaned laundry.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this one.</li>
            <li>It is a very light scent, not too heavy and not too musky.  </li>
            <li>\\&quot;A rich and daring scent with fresh green notes of fern and pine, warmed with woody notes of oakmoss and</li>
            <li>for young and old alike&lt;br /&gt;Reminds me very much of Ireland</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a much welcomed change from the all too common musky, overwhelming, leathery colognes on the market.</li>
            <li>Also a very classy bottle.</li>
            <li>I first found this cologne in an Irish shop in New Hope</li>
            <li>I have been looking for the right cologne for a long time.</li>
            <li>I like it very much, but it does not stay for long.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a comforting scent, yet still strongly masculine.</li>
            <li>Everyone, young and old alike, loves it and continues to compliment me on it&#x27;s scent, not to mention the lady LOVES it.</li>
            <li>I bought some for my husband, and almost immediately my adult son wanted it too.</li>
            <li>Ordered this as an alternative to my Stetson &amp; Old Spice standbys.  </li>
            <li>Its green notes are lively and fresh.</li>
            <li>Usually when someones likes something they get a a gift they let you know, and visa versa if they don&#x27;t there not going to hurt your feelings and say no i hate it.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately not what I expected.</li>
            <li>we love this smell and spent years after finding it in a little store in San Francisco to locate it online.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a &amp;#34;light&amp;#34; scent and is quite bold, you do not need a heavy application of spray.</li>
            <li>The two major notes I picked up are cedar and moss.</li>
            <li>It has a fresh out of the shower type smell with a little masculinity.  </li>
            <li>I use this cologne for days when i need long lasting freshness, but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for a date or intimate setting.</li>
            <li>Compare that to colognes and perfumes that I have purchased directly from a department store that last a minimum of a year.  </li>
            <li>Patrick opens with the fresh blast of green fern, which keeps its edge for a while, but gradually fades as the deep patchouli notes take over.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d never heard of the cologne, stumbled upon it in a small Irish gift shop and did a quick spray..</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very hard to break down the scent of any cologne or perfume, but the Patrick web site had a great graphic with a triangle that broke down the scents</li>
            <li>NOT LONG LASTING.  </li>

            <li> Nicely scented cologne, smells rather woodsy and like a fir tree.</li>
            <li> I have no idea if the person liked it or not.</li>
            <li> Not something that very many would find appealing.</li>
            <li> Great price and delivered quickly.</li>
            <li> Shipped quickly and a great price&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li> The store closed where I used to get this cologne, so I was very happy to find it at a good price and it arrived so quickly.&lt;br /&gt;5</li>
            <li> A nice strong manly scent.</li>
            <li> I was told that this was a nice, refreshing scent, but it is waaaaaaaaay too strong and overpowering for my taste.</li>
            <li> I get more compliments on how it smells from others.</li>
            <li> and I love that.</li>
            <li> When it runs out I will be purchasing more.</li>
            <li> My favorite cologne.</li>
            <li> He has declared this his favorite cologne of all time.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> First I&#x27;d like to say this seller is amazing!</li>
            <li> We both love love love it.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery and the fragrance smells great.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s his favorite scent.  </li>
            <li> Became acquainted with it while in Ireland many years ago and still love the fragrance</li>
            <li> and I love the way he smells.  </li>
            <li> One of my favorite fragrances for all day wear.</li>
            <li> I have had many compliments on the fragrance.</li>
            <li> like- a lot better fragrances out there.</li>
            <li> and I have received many compliments on it even after having worn it for hours.</li>
            <li> Love the scent.</li>
            <li> and we love it.  </li>
            <li> I know two people that wear this cologne, both receive many compliments on it.</li>
            <li> Nice and light but still manly.</li>
            <li> We were in Ireland last April and saw this cologne on sale there - we meant to grab some and didn&#x27;t, so we were so happy to find it online!  </li>
            <li> I love</li>
            <li> Will surely want to always have a supply on hand.</li>
            <li> Thje fragrance is lovely.</li>
            <li> The shipping was very fast and the product came in good condition.</li>
            <li> Not too strong or overpowering, but that reflects his exotic and outdoorsy personality.  </li>
            <li> This is a great masculine scent that truly reminds us of the magical trip we got to have.</li>
            <li> Thank god it is becoming easier to find.</li>
            <li> I like it, and more importantly, the ladies seem to like it.  </li>
            <li> Smells so good, very manly...</li>
            <li> Its not overpowering and because it&#x27;s not found all over its more unique.</li>
            <li> my mom bought this fro me for my birthday!!i love the clean smell of it...</li>
            <li> Good for someone who likes more natural scents.</li>
            <li> There is a strong scent of greenery (guessing from ferns).</li>
            <li> I found this cologne while traveling and liked it very much, my wife and daughter also like it.  </li>
            <li> My husband has liked this scent since I bought it or him on our first trip to Ireland in  2004.</li>
            <li> This cologne is very clean and mild fragrance.  </li>
            <li> This makes a nice gift - it&#x27;s unusual and you can&#x27;t find it everywhere - it&#x27;s imported from Ireland.</li>
            <li> The scent is not what I was expecting, but I enjoy it nonetheless.</li>
            <li> and I actually enjoy it myself.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad that I&#x27;ve found it here at a consistent price.  </li>
            <li> This was originally ordered for someone else as a gift, however they changed their mind before it arrived</li>
            <li> This smells amazing almost like Irish Springs but more.</li>
            <li> I knew the more mainstream colognes would be too much</li>
            <li> Really nice and masculine fragrance.</li>
            <li> unusual that they don&#x27;t make one, most men&#x27;s products give you a choice.  </li>
            <li> Clean, fresh, and unique.  </li>
            <li> This men&#x27;s cologne has the right balance: it is not too overpowering, and it is not too light.</li>
            <li> It is a bit strong at first, but you get used to it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The product has a fresh clean smell that others seem to like.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This is a good cologne; we got it for my 15 year old brother who is a boy scout, and he really likes it.</li>
            <li> Now we can enjoy the scent, and not pay way too much!</li>
            <li> EXACTLY what I wanted!    </li>
            <li> It is a classic men&#x27;s type of fragrance yet still smells modern, clean, and refreshing.</li>
            <li> it has amazing lasting power</li>
            <li> bottom line is I really like this cologne and would recommend it to anyone looking for a light, fresh scent.</li>
            <li> Not overpowering and great for everyday use.</li>
            <li> The scent is very mysterious and rugged in an Irishy kind of way...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice to have a regular scent that does not get lost amongst what everyone else is wearing.</li>
            <li> I rarely wear cologne</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not heavy or cloying and the scent lasts many hours.</li>
            <li> Clean, fresh and somewhat lasting.  Not an overwhelming fragrance.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not like the dozens of perfumes that all smell alike and really has a unique aroma.</li>
            <li> It stands out for the other ones out there in a good way.</li>
            <li> when my man wears this I just want to jump on him right then and there.</li>
            <li> GREAT INITIAL SMELL, BUT DISAPPEARS AFTER A SHORT TIME.  </li>
            <li> The first time I ran out, it took 6 months to locate.</li>
            <li> Buying online from Amazon and other places advertised on Amazon is much better!</li>
            <li> Is exactly as the box describes:  </li>
            <li> I love that it appeals to my earthy sensibilities and doesn&#x27;t smell too urban.</li>
            <li> Husband finished first bottle of colonge from our 2008 honeymoon in October.  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t able to smell it but judging from the recipient&#x27;s reaction it was a big hit!</li>
            <li> This is the first cologne I ever bought for my boyfriend when we first started dating 10 years ago.</li>
            <li> You can definitely smell the oak moss as the top note though.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it , I purchased Patrick in Ireland over 20 years ago.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Smells like a Nursing home filled with musky 80 years plus old men.  </li>
            <li> It is still my personal favorite.</li>
            <li> but this was exactly how I imagined the earthy aroma.  </li>
            <li> ;-)</li>
            <li> This is a good, traditional, male scented cologne.</li>
            <li> Probably would smell good with a sweater on next to a fire with your babe next to you.  </li>
            <li> Reminiscent of the old favorite classic that your dad wore (you know the one !), but has a more modern classy feel.</li>
            <li> People have commented positively about the scent.&lt;br /&gt;It is not overpowering.  </li>
            <li> smells for pretty much ever cologne out there.</li>
            <li> the scent of the cologne is not too strong and i got several positive  compliments on it</li>
            <li> My boyfriend is a loyal old spice guy</li>
            <li> Very clever.</li>
            <li> I first saw and smelled it at a great little Irish store in Austin, TX.</li>
            <li> I will certainly order this again from Amazon for my dad.</li>
            <li> It smells very woodsy.  </li>
            <li> It seems to be a very subjective smell.</li>
            <li> I really like it quite a bit.</li>
            <li> Words don&#x27;t really convey smells very well, haha.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> really like Man of Aran cologne a lot</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t really.</li>
            <li> I really like this fragrance.  </li>
            <li> I really like the scent.  </li>
            <li> wife really likes it.  </li>
            <li> Patrick is a warm smelling cologne that is just different enough for others to notice and comment on without being over powering.  </li>
            <li> The scents of moss and pine are probably the most prevalent for me and the overall vibe for me is just natural and Earthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would recommend purchasing to any man wanting a unique style of smelling different from the rest.</li>
            <li> you can order a sample of this and their other cologne to be sure you like it.</li>
            <li> One note of particular is that it does seem to wear off fast, not sure if this is just my nose becoming attenuated or it dissipates quickly.</li>
            <li> I bought it blind based on reviews and couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.</li>
            <li> Reactions to it have been very positive, from it smells woodsy and rough to it smells like freshly cleaned laundry.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this one.</li>
            <li> It is a very light scent, not too heavy and not too musky.  </li>
            <li> \\&quot;A rich and daring scent with fresh green notes of fern and pine, warmed with woody notes of oakmoss and</li>
            <li> for young and old alike&lt;br /&gt;Reminds me very much of Ireland</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a much welcomed change from the all too common musky, overwhelming, leathery colognes on the market.</li>
            <li> Also a very classy bottle.</li>
            <li> I first found this cologne in an Irish shop in New Hope</li>
            <li> I have been looking for the right cologne for a long time.</li>
            <li> I like it very much, but it does not stay for long.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a comforting scent, yet still strongly masculine.</li>
            <li> Everyone, young and old alike, loves it and continues to compliment me on it&#x27;s scent, not to mention the lady LOVES it.</li>
            <li> I bought some for my husband, and almost immediately my adult son wanted it too.</li>
            <li> Ordered this as an alternative to my Stetson &amp; Old Spice standbys.  </li>
            <li> Its green notes are lively and fresh.</li>
            <li> Usually when someones likes something they get a a gift they let you know, and visa versa if they don&#x27;t there not going to hurt your feelings and say no i hate it.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately not what I expected.</li>
            <li> we love this smell and spent years after finding it in a little store in San Francisco to locate it online.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a &amp;#34;light&amp;#34; scent and is quite bold, you do not need a heavy application of spray.</li>
            <li> The two major notes I picked up are cedar and moss.</li>
            <li> It has a fresh out of the shower type smell with a little masculinity.  </li>
            <li> I use this cologne for days when i need long lasting freshness, but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for a date or intimate setting.</li>
            <li> Compare that to colognes and perfumes that I have purchased directly from a department store that last a minimum of a year.  </li>
            <li> Patrick opens with the fresh blast of green fern, which keeps its edge for a while, but gradually fades as the deep patchouli notes take over.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d never heard of the cologne, stumbled upon it in a small Irish gift shop and did a quick spray..</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very hard to break down the scent of any cologne or perfume, but the Patrick web site had a great graphic with a triangle that broke down the scents</li>
            <li> NOT LONG LASTING.  </li>
            <li> The first bottle game from a store in Ireland near Blarney Castle.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s long lasting</li>
            <li> Holds long, not overpowering.</li>
            <li> Smells similar to Drakkar, the sent lasts longer than I expected.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very different scent from my other colognes.</li>
            <li> My nose is not acute enough to pick out individual scents.</li>
            <li> It smells like wet earth and moldy leaves.</li>
            <li> Then again, I wear Green Irish Tweed.</li>
            <li> My Wife Loved the scent, but I hated the price.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even know who I can give this to other than the person who recommended it to me.</li>
            <li> Since I cannot find a local supplier, I&#x27;ve been buying off of ebay for the past 5 years.</li>
            <li> Its almost as if there is a earthy base tone and several lighter overlying, spicy sweet tones that combine to give it a mysterius scensory delight.</li>
            <li> I had to purchase it and found it here for half of what the gift shop was charging.</li>
            <li> A little stronger than I was expecting however.</li>
            <li> I know pine is not listed as one of the notes but it has that sort of green freshness to it.</li>
            <li> This purchase was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I decided to check on Amazon, and the price was about 30% less than I&#x27;d paid for my husband&#x27;s bottle at the shop!</li>
            <li> I have used this product in the past.  </li>
            <li> The cologne was so old when I bought it that it went bad in 3 months.  </li>
            <li> This scent seems to be complex</li>
            <li> I never get tired of the fragrance.</li>
            <li> and I never get tired of it.</li>
            <li> However, I have found it impossible to find locally, so at least we had it for 3 months.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with this fragrance.</li>
            <li> I got this without having smelled it before, which turned out to be a bad idea.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is an awesome product that is under the radar for most people. I bought it blind based on reviews and couldn&#x27;t be more pleased. It is a classic men&#x27;s type of fragrance yet still smells modern, clean, and refreshing. If that is the type of fragrance you&#x27;re looking for then you&#x27;ll want to try this one.</li>
            <li> the scent of the cologne is not too strong and i got several positive  compliments on it</li>
            <li> I have used Patrick for over 10 years. I never get tired of the fragrance. Niether does my lady. I get more compliments on how it smells from others. Thank god it is becoming easier to find. The first time I ran out, it took 6 months to locate. Now I find it at multiple on line locations.</li>
            <li> I think of St. Patrick every time I use this Cologne I know St. Patrick is going to help me throughout the day and I love that.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend is a loyal old spice guy but I wanted him to try something different.  I knew the more mainstream colognes would be too much so I thought we would give this a try.  It smells great and isn&#x27;t overpowering.  The perfect cologne!</li>
            <li> This is a good, traditional, male scented cologne. The two major notes I picked up are cedar and moss. It smells very woodsy.  The shipping was very fast and the product came in good condition.</li>
            <li> This cologne is a deeply spiced scent. My nose is not acute enough to pick out individual scents. Reactions to it have been very positive, from it smells woodsy and rough to it smells like freshly cleaned laundry. It seems to be a very subjective smell. I really like it quite a bit. When it runs out I will be purchasing more. One note of particular is that it does seem to wear off fast, not sure if this is just my nose becoming attenuated or it dissipates quickly. Either way, great buy.</li>
            <li> My favorite cologne. Very clean fragrance and a great gift.</li>
            <li> Wonderful men&#x27;s earthy fragrance</li>
            <li> My Wife and I stayed at an Irish Cottage, and they had THIS cologne for sale. My Wife Loved the scent, but I hated the price. Buying online from Amazon and other places advertised on Amazon is much better! Best of Both worlds! Now we can enjoy the scent, and not pay way too much!</li>
            <li> I was told that this was a nice, refreshing scent, but it is waaaaaaaaay too strong and overpowering for my taste. I don&#x27;t even know who I can give this to other than the person who recommended it to me. Oh! Now I see, they knew I wouldn&#x27;t like it and therefore I would give it to them. Ha! Very clever. No offense to those who give it steller ratings...just not my type of scent. peace.</li>
            <li> This is the ABSOLUTE BEST cologne I have ever purchased...The scent is very mysterious and rugged in an Irishy kind of way...EXACTLY what I wanted!    [[ASIN:B000P8FNGS Patrick Cologne Spray 100ml]]</li>
            <li> we love this smell and spent years after finding it in a little store in San Francisco to locate it online.</li>
            <li> Gave it to my husband for his birthday.  He loves it .  People have commented positively about the scent.&lt;br /&gt;It is not overpowering.  It is subtle,but noticeable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for the perfect scent for my guy for ages.  Not too strong or overpowering, but that reflects his exotic and outdoorsy personality.  This is perfect.  Is exactly as the box describes:  \\&quot;A rich and daring scent with fresh green notes of fern and pine, warmed with woody notes of oakmoss and patchouli.\\&quot;  I love that it appeals to my earthy sensibilities and doesn&#x27;t smell too urban. Great price and delivered quickly.</li>
            <li> Husband finished first bottle of colonge from our 2008 honeymoon in October.  Christmas 2011 brought the scent back to his bathroom shelf.</li>
            <li> This cologne smells so nice.  It has a fresh out of the shower type smell with a little masculinity.  I bought it for my husband.  He has declared this his favorite cologne of all time.</li>
            <li> Husband likes it!  He puts it up there as one of  his favorites.  Clean, fresh and somewhat lasting.  Not an overwhelming fragrance.</li>
            <li> Love it. Will order it again for my husband and son.</li>
            <li> First I&#x27;d like to say this seller is amazing! Arived a week faster then the est. time.&lt;br /&gt;This has to be one of my fav. sents ever. Its green notes are lively and fresh. it has amazing lasting power</li>
            <li> my mom bought this fro me for my birthday!!i love the clean smell of it...wow!!!~~~~~k meyers....houston texas.....its a keeper!!...o yes!</li>
            <li> I got this without having smelled it before, which turned out to be a bad idea. I&#x27;m not going to try to describe the smell as that&#x27;s pretty pointless to do. Words don&#x27;t really convey smells very well, haha.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like Man of Aran cologne a lot and I was hoping that this would be along those lines. It isn&#x27;t really. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend buying this smell unsmelled as I did.</li>
            <li> I discovered &amp;#34;Patrick&amp;#34; cologne for men about 10 years ago and I keep giving it to my husband. We both love love love it.</li>
            <li> Since I cannot find a local supplier, I&#x27;ve been buying off of ebay for the past 5 years. I&#x27;m so glad that I&#x27;ve found it here at a consistent price.  Patrick is a warm smelling cologne that is just different enough for others to notice and comment on without being over powering.  It&#x27;s nice to have a regular scent that does not get lost amongst what everyone else is wearing.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t able to smell it but judging from the recipient&#x27;s reaction it was a big hit! This makes a nice gift - it&#x27;s unusual and you can&#x27;t find it everywhere - it&#x27;s imported from Ireland.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful scent for both men and women. It&#x27;s long lasting and I never get tired of it. It&#x27;s not like the dozens of perfumes that all smell alike and really has a unique aroma.</li>
            <li> This is the first cologne I ever bought for my boyfriend when we first started dating 10 years ago. It&#x27;s a much welcomed change from the all too common musky, overwhelming, leathery colognes on the market. I think Patrick smells a lot like a Christmas tree. I know pine is not listed as one of the notes but it has that sort of green freshness to it. You can definitely smell the oak moss as the top note though. It&#x27;s a comforting scent, yet still strongly masculine. I highly recommend this one.</li>
            <li> Purchased for son, who loves cologne.  He loved it.</li>
            <li> He likes it.  I like it, and more importantly, the ladies seem to like it.  Clean, fresh, and unique.  Stand out from the herd.</li>
            <li> Great product. Loved it</li>
            <li> I have used this Patrick cologne for years. Everyone, young and old alike, loves it and continues to compliment me on it&#x27;s scent, not to mention the lady LOVES it. I would recommend to any man who needs a good cologne.</li>
            <li> I have used this product in the past.  The first time I used it , I purchased Patrick in Ireland over 20 years ago.&lt;br /&gt;The product has a fresh clean smell that others seem to like.&lt;br /&gt;I have give the product as a gift and others like it as well.&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to purchase Partick in the future.</li>
            <li> The store closed where I used to get this cologne, so I was very happy to find it at a good price and it arrived so quickly.&lt;br /&gt;5 stars  for sure!</li>
            <li> Fast delivery and the fragrance smells great.</li>
            <li> This purchase was a waste of money. It smells like wet earth and moldy leaves. Not something that very many would find appealing.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for the right cologne for a long time. I&#x27;m not a big fan of the overpowered smells for pretty much ever cologne out there. For this one it smells great without being a skunk about it.</li>
            <li> this was a gift for my father.  he gets cologne for Christmas every year and he is from Ireland.  he absolutely loved this scent and I did as well.  absolutely great gift!!!!</li>
            <li> Great price on a great scent</li>
            <li> I found this cologne while traveling and liked it very much, my wife and daughter also like it.  I rarely wear cologne but this is the best I have found, the aroma is very pleasant but not overpowering.</li>
            <li> I purchased this cologne for my father.  It&#x27;s his favorite scent.  I searched for quite a while online to find the cheapest price and Amazon had it! I will certainly order this again from Amazon for my dad.</li>
            <li> This cologne is very clean and mild fragrance.  Reminiscent of the old favorite classic that your dad wore (you know the one !), but has a more modern classy feel.</li>
            <li> NOT LONG LASTING.  FRAGRANCE DISAPPEARS WITHIN FIVE MINUTES AT BEST.  GREAT INITIAL SMELL, BUT DISAPPEARS AFTER A SHORT TIME.  OOMPH PREFERRED.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with this fragrance. Became acquainted with it while in Ireland many years ago and still love the fragrance</li>
            <li> Really nice and masculine fragrance. Gets tons of compliments. Holds long, not overpowering. I would recommend purchasing to any man wanting a unique style of smelling different from the rest.</li>
            <li> Good, manly fragrance. A little stronger than I was expecting however.</li>
            <li> I bought Patrick as a birthday gift for my husband.  He loves it and I love the way he smells.  Wonderful fragrance for any man!!!!</li>
            <li> Patrick opens with the fresh blast of green fern, which keeps its edge for a while, but gradually fades as the deep patchouli notes take over.  I really like this fragrance.  Great for spring and autumn.  Also a very classy bottle.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite fragrances for all day wear. There is a strong scent of greenery (guessing from ferns). I use this cologne for days when i need long lasting freshness, but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for a date or intimate setting. A nice strong manly scent.</li>
            <li> I really like the scent.  Everytime I wear it people seem to compliment me.  This fragrance is a great companion to another favorite: Inis: Energy of the Sea.</li>
            <li> I got this Patrick Cologne Spray for someone named Patrick. It was a great surprise that it smells really good!  Kind of earathy. I would recommend.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells like something you would get from Avon in the decanters shaped like dog and cars. Lesson learned to not buy things like this online.</li>
            <li> I have bought this cologne 3 times over the years for my boyfriend. It has a wonderful scent that we both enjoy!</li>
            <li> Smells like a Nursing home filled with musky 80 years plus old men.  Then again, I wear Green Irish Tweed.</li>
            <li> My husband and I purchased this for him some time ago because we both liked it. It is still my personal favorite.</li>
            <li> Smells so good, very manly...he loved it:) Shipped quickly and a great price&lt;br /&gt;Good for young and old alike&lt;br /&gt;Reminds me very much of Ireland</li>
            <li> The product arrived in excellent condition and in a timely manner.I first found this cologne in an Irish shop in New Hope Pa.&lt;br /&gt;I only find it in Irish shops.I have had many compliments on the fragrance.Its not overpowering and because it&#x27;s not found all over its more unique.</li>
            <li> Gotta admit. I like this one. Has a lot of staying power. It&#x27;s a very different scent from my other colognes. Probably would smell good with a sweater on next to a fire with your babe next to you.  You would say, &amp;#34;Hey baby.  You like my cologne?&amp;#34;  She would giggle as your pour her a 5th glass of wine.  Then you probably would start smelling yourself because of this cologne and ignore her.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very hard to break down the scent of any cologne or perfume, but the Patrick web site had a great graphic with a triangle that broke down the scents and I&#x27;ve uploaded it to the images here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I admit I&#x27;m biased, I think the best beer comes from Ireland and the best whiskey comes from Ireland so I decided to try Patrick without ever smelling it.  Was very pleased that I did.  It is a very light scent, not too heavy and not too musky.  The scents of moss and pine are probably the most prevalent for me and the overall vibe for me is just natural and Earthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottom line is I really like this cologne and would recommend it to anyone looking for a light, fresh scent.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy it- not what you want to smell like- a lot better fragrances out there.</li>
            <li> I just started wearing this cologne and I have received many compliments on it even after having worn it for hours. Yet it does not overpower and does not get offensive. I&#x27;d never heard of the cologne, stumbled upon it in a small Irish gift shop and did a quick spray.. It was incredible. I had to purchase it and found it here for half of what the gift shop was charging. I wanted to let it linger before making the purchase and it \\&quot;lingered\\&quot; well with my skin chemistry. I wish it also came in a deodorant and skin balm! I&#x27;ll be buying another bottle soon.</li>
            <li> I like it very much, but it does not stay for long. Great company that shipped it, got it fast and packed great.</li>
            <li> The cologne was so old when I bought it that it went bad in 3 months.  Compare that to colognes and perfumes that I have purchased directly from a department store that last a minimum of a year.  However, I have found it impossible to find locally, so at least we had it for 3 months. Love the scent.</li>
            <li> The scent is not what I was expecting, but I enjoy it nonetheless. The bottle is also waaaaay bigger than I thought it was going to be so, it&#x27;s going to last for a while.</li>
            <li> This scent seems to be complex and I think thats what makes it so compeling to me. Its almost as if there is a earthy base tone and several lighter overlying, spicy sweet tones that combine to give it a mysterius scensory delight. It does last awhile too. I would buy this again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been to the home land but this was exactly how I imagined the earthy aroma.  I was a great gift!</li>
            <li> Patrick cologne smells heavenly! I first saw and smelled it at a great little Irish store in Austin, TX. I bought some for my husband, and almost immediately my adult son wanted it too. I decided to check on Amazon, and the price was about 30% less than I&#x27;d paid for my husband&#x27;s bottle at the shop! I bought bottles for 3 of the men in our family for Christmas in 2011. As Christmas of 2012 approached, all of these family members asked me to please buy it for them again! Yes, it&#x27;s THAT good!</li>
            <li> A friend of my wife suggested it for us,so we purchased it and we love it.  Would recommend it to others</li>
            <li> This was originally ordered for someone else as a gift, however they changed their mind before it arrived so I kept it and I actually enjoy it myself.</li>
            <li> I have had this fragrance before : always get compliments when I wear it..wife really likes it.  Fragrances of Ireland makes great fragrances, Patrick is my favorite but Innis is very good also</li>
            <li> My husband loves it! He has over 60 colognes, but that one took over the rest. Even though the others are good brands.</li>
            <li> I know two people that wear this cologne, both receive many compliments on it. It smells different on each of them as well as just spraying it into the air. It make you want to take a deep breath and keep smelling it, like your at the beach. It&#x27;s not heavy or cloying and the scent lasts many hours.</li>
            <li> Ordered this as an alternative to my Stetson &amp; Old Spice standbys.  Took a Chance because of the reviews.&lt;br /&gt;Like the understated fragrance... not overpowering or flowerery!  Received some good comments.  I would have preferred an aftershave .. unusual that they don&#x27;t make one, most men&#x27;s products give you a choice.  (Or maybe they do &amp; I just haven&#x27;t found it!)&lt;br /&gt;Anyway I&#x27;m happy with this.</li>
            <li> Great fragrance.  This was my second bottle.  The first bottle game from a store in Ireland near Blarney Castle.</li>
            <li> I kid you not, every man who wears this reports back to me that people will stop and ask what cologne he is wearing.</li>
            <li> Nicely scented cologne, smells rather woodsy and like a fir tree. Good for someone who likes more natural scents. It is a bit strong at first, but you get used to it. If you go to the website of the company that makes this cologne (http://perfume.ie/) you can order a sample of this and their other cologne to be sure you like it. The samples cost $2 each, but when you order one your receive a $2 off coupon for your order. This is a good cologne; we got it for my 15 year old brother who is a boy scout, and he really likes it.</li>
            <li> This smells spicy. Its a great one to put on before a night out on the town. It stands out for the other ones out there in a good way. I would buy again.</li>
            <li> This Fragrance captures well the feelings and smells that Ireland evokes for me, I love it!  Prompt Shipping and a great price to boot:)</li>
            <li> Obviously we like the scent! Nice and light but still manly. ;-)</li>
            <li> My husband has liked this scent since I bought it or him on our first trip to Ireland in  2004. Now I buy it for him each time we go back.(2006,2009,and 2012) However I didn&#x27;t get any this time so it was a must for a Christmas gift.</li>
            <li> I have no idea if the person liked it or not. Usually when someones likes something they get a a gift they let you know, and visa versa if they don&#x27;t there not going to hurt your feelings and say no i hate it.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately not what I expected. It smells like grandpa. It&#x27;s sitting on my shelf waiting for a trip to Goodwill.</li>
            <li> probably my favorite cologne, great earthy scent.</li>
            <li> We were in Ireland last April and saw this cologne on sale there - we meant to grab some and didn&#x27;t, so we were so happy to find it online!  This is a great masculine scent that truly reminds us of the magical trip we got to have.</li>
            <li> Smells similar to Drakkar, the sent lasts longer than I expected. It&#x27;s not a &amp;#34;light&amp;#34; scent and is quite bold, you do not need a heavy application of spray.</li>
            <li> I gave this to my non-Irish husband for St. Patricks day. Our son is names Patrick ! My husband loves it !</li>
            <li> This men&#x27;s cologne has the right balance: it is not too overpowering, and it is not too light. And a great bargain for the price paid.</li>
            <li> This smells amazing almost like Irish Springs but more. I love when my man wears this I just want to jump on him right then and there.</li>
            <li> love this fragrance of Ireland!!, it is the best...</li>
            <li> my husband grow up in Ireland and his dad bought him some over to state when visted so when my hubby ran out was happy to be able to order.</li>
            <li> Product came in the window that was advertised. I would use this company again.</li>
            <li> I love this cologne! Not overpowering and great for everyday use. Will surely want to always have a supply on hand. Arrived from seller promptly and at a very good price.</li>
            <li> I was very happy to be able to get Patrick for a gift for my brother&#x27;s 80th birthday after he hinted he wanted it!  It arrived promptly in perfect condition and my brother was very pleased, so was I.  Thje fragrance is lovely.</li>
