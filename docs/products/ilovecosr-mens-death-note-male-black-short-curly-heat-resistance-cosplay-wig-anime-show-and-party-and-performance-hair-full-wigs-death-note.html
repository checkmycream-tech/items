            <li>Heat resistant as promised, and the hair is simply amazing.</li>
            <li>Okay, so I had read all the good reviews</li>
            <li>My son is thrilled.</li>
            <li>I honestly thought it would be longer and thicker.</li>
            <li>(nice</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice wig, but I recommend this for any homestucks who cosplay:</li>
            <li>The cap was constructed nicely.</li>
            <li>Before I continue, I just got this wig today, so this is sort of a &amp;#34;first impressions&amp;#34; kind of review.</li>
            <li>The wig came sooner then said, which was nice.</li>
            <li>She&#x27;s happy , so that made me happy that I picked a decent wig.</li>
            <li>it fit perfectly and looked pretty good for my L cosplay</li>
            <li>It works nicely, it&#x27;s heat resistant, it&#x27;s a pleasant looking wig, fits well, and it came with a free wig cap.</li>
            <li>Really nice length and easy to style!</li>
            <li>It got many nice compliments, and served its purpose as intended.</li>
            <li>Very fine material.</li>
            <li>great quality, soft, and very easily styled !</li>
            <li>top it all off, it&#x27;s not even the length that it&#x27;s advertised as.</li>
            <li>I plan on using it for Jeff the Killer from Creepypasta, but now I&#x27;m not so sure...</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s going to need a LOT more styling than I had planned.</li>
            <li>I am sure I would love it if I ever had received it.</li>
            <li>It looks more like a mullet in person than in this picture.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>okay.</li>
            <li>I like it! :)</li>
            <li>but I love the wig</li>
            <li>It was an okay wig, worked what I needed it for, but it shed a TON.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an OK wig.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This wig is great and doesn&#x27;t appear to be too shiny, the texture is very soft.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really love this wig.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s more of a bob hair</li>
            <li>I love it~</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s one of my favorite wigs~</li>
            <li>Many peaople had no clue it was a wig, they thought she straightened her hair like her sister&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>Not a terrible product</li>
            <li>and I was still able to stuff it all underneath the wig and you cant see it at all.</li>
            <li>I definitely recommend this wig, as it covers the eyes just perfectly, like Mituna&#x27;s hair does.</li>
            <li>I was so glad to have gotten it before September!&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
            <li>So many to choose from</li>
            <li>my daughter love this wig.  </li>
            <li>I love Amazon</li>
            <li>Like most cosplay wigs, it did not come styled and had a bit of a swoopy fringe.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my Karkat and Gamzee cosplay, but I have yet to receive it, although I hope when it comes I will fall in love with it.</li>
            <li>after i had it styled it was okay.</li>
            <li>so I was able to find another use.</li>
            <li>Other than that, its an amazing wig and the shipping time is really great!</li>
            <li>The wig fits great, just be expected to cut it on your own!</li>
            <li>Great for for the price, and I highly recommend it for cosplayers.</li>
            <li>This wig is super cute!</li>
            <li>Its nice and full.</li>
            <li>I loved it so much!</li>
            <li>I got the wig in a pretty good time period</li>
            <li>The wig has really good texture and thickness, and it&#x27;s not weirdly shiny.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a pretty good wig for what you pay, and has a lot of hair so you can style it to your liking.</li>
            <li>Good quality,  has stood up to repeated washings and hot iron straightenings.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m excited to use it!</li>
            <li>Love this wig can be shaped and typed easily.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not noticeably shiny like Halloween wigs and was easy to work with plus it came with a free wig cap!</li>
            <li>I will say that, since it&#x27;s so flipped out, you may have to straighten it for certain characters, but it feels like good material, so</li>
            <li>Despite that, it is a great, natural looking wig for every day use as well as cosplay.</li>
            <li>needed.&lt;br /&gt;The wig is also extremely easy to style.</li>
            <li>The hair falls out easily.</li>
            <li>but thats an easy fix</li>
            <li>The wig came I very quick.  </li>
            <li>Styling is super easy, you can get some great fluff, this is easily my favorite wig I own.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty full and has some nice layers, though I did have to add more</li>
            <li>Its really soft and is perfect for my cosplay ((Gamzee Makara from Homestuck))&lt;br /&gt;Its a bit shorter than I expected but its good ^^</li>
            <li>and I live in Alaska, so it was really surprising.</li>
            <li>If you know how to style then you might be fine.</li>
            <li>Not to mention it&#x27;s SUPER matted at the top.</li>
            <li>It did fit my 6 year old perfectly who also has a normal sized head.</li>
            <li>This is probably my new favorite wig that I own.</li>
            <li>This item arrived early and looked super great on.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s purpose well, and with a little product it was nearly perfect.</li>
            <li>wig would work good for Gamzee Makara I think, and it would also be great for Karkat Vantas, John Egbert, and Jake English (with some trimming and styling).&lt;br /&gt;I loved this wig so much that I actually bought another one</li>
            <li>and it came with a free wig cap</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t fit my head at all.</li>
            <li>This item also came with a free wig cap which is a plus since I didn&#x27;t have one.</li>
            <li>am happy with my order, but maybe the reason why it looks big on my head, is because of my curly, and frizzy hair.&lt;br /&gt;Warning:</li>
            <li>It also doesn&#x27;t shed, even when shaking it out or lightly tugging on the locks.</li>
            <li>Had it fit, it may have worked for my needs, but the size just didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li>so i know a cheap wig when i see one</li>
            <li>Perfect.thankyou for such a great product.</li>
            <li>It was really soft and actually really good with dealing with heat.</li>
            <li>Because of this it is very unstable even with bobbie pins, and sits on top of my head more like a hat than a wig.</li>
            <li>even came with black wig caps! :D</li>
            <li>I both agreed it&#x27;s more of a Kanaya wig if you style it right.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s beautiful and really good and all,but it&#x27;s really small,it fit my little sisters but not me.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s super easy to style</li>
            <li>The length was perfect, and it wasn&#x27;t too small, it fit snugly on my head.</li>
            <li>Not only did the wig come EARLY, but it also came with a free wig cap that fit perfectly.</li>
            <li>It is good for occasionally going out in cosplay, but the strands do fall out easily</li>
            <li>I love it so much!</li>
            <li>and it was super cheap feeling</li>
            <li>its nice and soft and pretty full for the most part but its shorter than pictured</li>
            <li>I love how this wig looks really realistic!</li>
            <li>The wig has minimal shine and is just great over all.</li>
            <li>what I liked about the wig was that it was soft.</li>
            <li>And its nice and soft.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice wig, it&#x27;s soft.</li>
            <li>The hair is course which is what I needed and the back is a good length.</li>
            <li>but I have to admit not a bad wig it also works well for a lot of the trolls in Homestuck</li>
            <li>Really nice wig, super soft and comfy.</li>
            <li>But other then that its great.</li>
            <li>great except for the frizzy fibers at the top which make it hard to part</li>
            <li>it super soft&lt;br /&gt;Perfect</li>
            <li>I love this wig, it fits for so many different cosplays!!!</li>
            <li>but the delievery time was super quick</li>
            <li>It feels silky smooth, and my family thought it was my real hair for a moment!</li>
            <li>Overall, very pleased with purchase.</li>
            <li>but I guess this is a warning to anyone with a bigger head than most - do measurements!</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t tried it against heat quite yet, but it actually is made of heat-resistant fibers, so I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;ll be just fine.</li>
            <li>This wig worked perfectly for my cosplay of Red and Catwoman, although it turned out being a bit shorter than I expected.</li>
            <li>Well worth the $16</li>
            <li>This wig is nice for the price, very durable and soft.</li>
            <li>If you want this wig honestly just goto party city it will be the same quality.</li>
            <li>It came in a clear zip up bag and was in lovely condition.</li>
            <li>A bit shorter than expected, but overall a great wig!</li>
            <li>but well worth the wait.</li>
            <li>but I didn&#x27;t realize that it was to make a more natrual looking part minus a skin top.</li>
            <li>So I&#x27;ll get my money&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li>It was a good deal for the money I spent.</li>
            <li>High quality wig and easy to style.</li>
            <li>Which was excellent as I had just broke the only other one I had before hand.</li>
            <li>First off it came in really quick</li>
            <li>just right.</li>
            <li>You will have to work with this wig quite a bit to get it to look right.  </li>
            <li>The bangs can be styled pretty much any way you like and it looks fantastic.</li>
            <li>As for the positives, it isn&#x27;t very shiny, it&#x27;s a beautiful deep black color (I&#x27;ve seen &amp;#34;black&amp;#34; wigs before that looked more brown), and it came three days before it was supposed to be here.</li>
            <li>so it barely fit my already normal sized head.</li>
            <li>/&gt;You&#x27;re better off simply going to a wig shop and getting something worth the money that you can see and feel in your&lt;br /&gt;hands</li>
            <li>wig also arrived in the mail so fast, I&#x27;ve never had something from China get here so quickly.</li>
            <li>Really nice, thick at the top wig (Which is what I was aiming for).</li>
            <li>But other than that is a really great wig it really soft and silky</li>
            <li>But I absolutely adore it!</li>
            <li>It is exactly what she wanted it to be.</li>
            <li>I was joking at first, but when I took it off they were surprised).&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I can style it multiple ways and can&#x27;t wait to wear it more.</li>
            <li>Love this wig so much, especially for the price!</li>
            <li>(Im an avid cosplayer</li>
            <li>The only thing that I would think would bother someone is the parting on the top of the wig.</li>
            <li>I wore it to work as an April Fools joke and everyone thought it was my real hair!</li>
            <li>Looked ok, but unless you have a tiny head and or/are bald</li>
            <li>I bought mine to first of all</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit thinner than I thought but pretty sturdy.</li>
            <li>There wasn&#x27;t too much shine, it had just the right amount.</li>
            <li>working with this for a few minutes will make you high five yourself for making such a great deal!</li>
            <li>The bangs are very long so I my cut them but other than that it&#x27;s very good.</li>
            <li>I was really excited when I got this wig in the mail, it came REALLY early, which was awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It even has the really nice tighter in it to like all my other cosplay wigs.</li>
            <li>Im absolutely going to purchase more from this seller in the future.</li>
            <li>I got my last wig for cheaper, and  it&#x27;s much softer and fits better.     </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure about such a cheap wig, but I saw enough positive reviews.</li>
            <li>Literally if you just run your hands through it to make it messy, it&#x27;ll stay like that for the most part (which is great since Mituna has messy hair), if you want it to stay like that</li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t exactly as it is pictured, much shorter in fact.</li>
            <li>It really doesn&#x27;t look like the picture much, however I&#x27;m sure with enough styling it will.  </li>
            <li>cut super super short</li>
            <li>I cut the front but the original length was super long so it gave you a lot of leeway to adjust it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really soft, not excessively shiny, and the hair can be easily styled (if you pull it/move it around, it stays very well).</li>
            <li>The wig cap is comfortable, which is a real plus because for me most wig caps are too small for</li>
            <li>so it was hard to get on at first but other than that its amazing!!!!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s honestly fits like a little kids</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s perfect for anime characters, all you need is a little hairspray, as its already cut into a choppy style.</li>
            <li>It did come with a wig cap, though I don&#x27;t really like the netted ones much</li>
            <li>It also isn&#x27;t curly like it says (it doesn&#x27;t really look curly in the picture, either), so it is straight, which I don&#x27;t mind at all.</li>
            <li>The wig was much shorted than depicted in the photo.</li>
            <li>It also flips and moves like real hair would.</li>
            <li>It also seems to shed quite a bit, so you&#x27;ll need to be gentle with it.</li>
            <li>Very well priced.</li>
            <li>Really shiny, I suggest dulling it if you use it for cosplay.</li>
            <li>Much shorter than it looks, as well.</li>
            <li>It doesnt hold to the heat very well.</li>
            <li>I recommend buying this wig if you have straight, and non curly hair.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t really shed from what I&#x27;ve seen.</li>
            <li>The texture is silky and the shine and color are very realistic-looking.</li>
            <li>You should be gentle when handling it because while it has a lot of hair at times a tuft or two will come out.</li>
            <li>And Its Very Comfy To Ware .</li>
            <li>Very manageable.</li>
            <li>so it doesn&#x27;t really matter that much to me.</li>
            <li>shipping is fast and it&#x27;s really good！</li>
            <li>Hasn&#x27;t shed much, which is a plus.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m trying to send it back because it doesn&#x27;t even fit.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this wig for any cosplayer!</li>
            <li>The hair isn&#x27;t as much as I would like it</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very good quality hair fibers and such, but very difficult to tell where the front is and everything, ALL of the hair is long, longer than I was expecting, but it is very nice and doesn&#x27;t shed much.</li>
            <li>bangs are SUPER long, but every wig I own came that way, so it&#x27;s to be expected.</li>
            <li>Very soft and shiny, but not fake looking like a Halloween-quality</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty soft and very realistic.  </li>
            <li>The top of the wig looks a little funny, but I guess I can&#x27;t complain for the price.</li>
            <li>Wayyyyy shorter than I expected and sheds a lot more than normal wigs.</li>
            <li>It arrived SUPER fast which was a big plus!</li>
            <li>very soft and thick and has good volume.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m wearing it right now, and it barely fits my head.</li>
            <li>/&gt;that&#x27;s not Amazon&#x27;s fault, but I can guarantee you that I&#x27;m never going to buy from this particular vendor again.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The black may seem a bit unreal to those with better eyes, however was able to convince a few friends that it was my real hair (on accident.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>It was nice and thick and the color is most certainly black.</li>
            <li>not a top notch wig, more like a very high end Halloween wig...</li>
            <li>I like this wig very much, soft and so real looking like hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty much like it is in the picture, except the actual feel and quality of the wig is sorta crappy.</li>
            <li>But that is quite normal for wigs.</li>
            <li>It had a bit to much shine at first, but once you play with it the extra shine goes away.</li>
            <li>but if I were using for multiple or long term I would be much more upset.</li>
            <li>and I have a normal sized head.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so soft and realistic looking.</li>
            <li>Good for L, as long as you have a small head.</li>
            <li>The fringe at the back of the wig really makes it look real, and it feels very soft.</li>
            <li>People keep thinking it&#x27;s real. o_o</li>
            <li>You can just kind of see the wefts slightly when the hair is swayed certain ways, but with a black wig cap on, which the wig came with, I don&#x27;t think it will be noticeable at all.</li>
            <li>Only because it will cost more trouble to send it back than what it is worth, I will be keeping it, albeit reluctantly.</li>
            <li>For such a small price was highly surprised at the amazing quality of the product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just a pain to cut them for me.&lt;br /&gt;Since the back is pretty layered, it is KIND OF thin.</li>
            <li>The wig I received was super thin and the mesh inside was of cheap material.</li>
            <li>Amazing quality wig ^.^ super thick the fibers were a bit thick and was difficult to style but other than that it was awesome.</li>
            <li>was completely blown off.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The bangs are long and cover my eyes, which is exactly what I</li>
            <li>Very itchy and gross feeling.</li>
            <li>Soft etc.</li>
            <li>It was short and sheds so much.</li>
            <li>Although this was easily fixed with a straighter and some adjusting it</li>
            <li>Oh, and if there are any negative reviews on this wig, I just think the person is trying to ruin the business, so don&#x27;t listen to them. :)</li>
            <li>I love this so much it arrived a week earlier than expected and it wasn&#x27;t too short or too long</li>
            <li>its great if you don&#x27;t want to do much styling, but it has a weird side part, and definitely wasnt as long or plush as the photo.</li>
            <li>The shipping time was good but the wig is very thin and has alot of spaces.</li>
            <li>I would say that if you&#x27;re planning on getting this wig, you should.&lt;br /&gt;Of course, I have had wigs in the past that were great at first and turned out to be horrible, but this one seems really nice.</li>
            <li>People who have know me a long time though it was my real hair</li>
            <li>The wig was incredibly small and wouldn&#x27;t fit over my head.</li>
            <li>I ordered this wig for Akaashi Keiji from Haikyuu because it look really full and fluffy like his hair</li>
            <li>Like some people have said, it is a little shorter than it looks in the picture, but luckily I needed it to be a bit shorter.</li>
            <li>I ordered this, and three other wigs on June 8th, and this one was the first to arrive.</li>
            <li>At first we were surprised by the shipping status that it was expected to several weeks after ordering, mid-November,  Ugh.  </li>
            <li>Very small as far as fit</li>
            <li>It was much shorter than the expected length, does not give enough room to fit my shoulder length hair into the cap, and causing it to only go down to the tip of my ears.</li>
            <li>I personally have no trouble with this, but the bangs cover alot of your face.</li>
            <li>It did arrive before Halloween unexpectedly, so I&#x27;ll give back a star for that.  </li>
            <li>There is barely any hair to it-</li>
            <li>The fibers are super thick and soft.</li>
            <li>or it might not fit quite right</li>
            <li>We bought a different cosplay wig from the Joker&#x27;s Wild, a local store, where we could check it out.</li>
            <li>This wig is really short and it barely fits my head</li>
            <li>wig!&lt;br /&gt;It is much like the picture, black with dark brown undertones in certain lighting.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s not even the right size, it&#x27;s exceedingly small, and does not fit.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It was to small and it didn&#x27;t have the right style.</li>
            <li>yes indeed it was a black wig but its MUCH shorter than the picture</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also not super shiny (Has about as much shine as real hair) and the hairs don&#x27;t fall out if you pull on them a little.</li>
            <li>The only real similarity is that they are black.</li>
            <li>my massive hair.&lt;br /&gt;The bangs are also super thick.</li>

            <li> (nice</li>

            <li> The cap was constructed nicely.</li>
            <li> Before I continue, I just got this wig today, so this is sort of a &amp;#34;first impressions&amp;#34; kind of review.</li>

            <li> Really nice length and easy to style!</li>
            <li> It got many nice compliments, and served its purpose as intended.</li>
            <li> Very fine material.</li>
            <li> great quality, soft, and very easily styled !</li>
            <li> top it all off, it&#x27;s not even the length that it&#x27;s advertised as.</li>
            <li> I plan on using it for Jeff the Killer from Creepypasta, but now I&#x27;m not so sure...</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s going to need a LOT more styling than I had planned.</li>
            <li> I am sure I would love it if I ever had received it.</li>
            <li> It looks more like a mullet in person than in this picture.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> okay.</li>
            <li> I like it! :)</li>
            <li> but I love the wig</li>
            <li> It was an okay wig, worked what I needed it for, but it shed a TON.</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an OK wig.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This wig is great and doesn&#x27;t appear to be too shiny, the texture is very soft.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really love this wig.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s more of a bob hair</li>
            <li> I love it~</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s one of my favorite wigs~</li>
            <li> Many peaople had no clue it was a wig, they thought she straightened her hair like her sister&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Not a terrible product</li>
            <li> and I was still able to stuff it all underneath the wig and you cant see it at all.</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend this wig, as it covers the eyes just perfectly, like Mituna&#x27;s hair does.</li>
            <li> I was so glad to have gotten it before September!&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
            <li> So many to choose from</li>
            <li> my daughter love this wig.  </li>
            <li> I love Amazon</li>
            <li> Like most cosplay wigs, it did not come styled and had a bit of a swoopy fringe.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my Karkat and Gamzee cosplay, but I have yet to receive it, although I hope when it comes I will fall in love with it.</li>
            <li> after i had it styled it was okay.</li>
            <li> so I was able to find another use.</li>
            <li> Other than that, its an amazing wig and the shipping time is really great!</li>
            <li> The wig fits great, just be expected to cut it on your own!</li>
            <li> Great for for the price, and I highly recommend it for cosplayers.</li>
            <li> This wig is super cute!</li>
            <li> Its nice and full.</li>
            <li> I loved it so much!</li>
            <li> I got the wig in a pretty good time period</li>
            <li> The wig has really good texture and thickness, and it&#x27;s not weirdly shiny.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a pretty good wig for what you pay, and has a lot of hair so you can style it to your liking.</li>
            <li> Good quality,  has stood up to repeated washings and hot iron straightenings.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m excited to use it!</li>
            <li> Love this wig can be shaped and typed easily.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not noticeably shiny like Halloween wigs and was easy to work with plus it came with a free wig cap!</li>
            <li> I will say that, since it&#x27;s so flipped out, you may have to straighten it for certain characters, but it feels like good material, so</li>
            <li> Despite that, it is a great, natural looking wig for every day use as well as cosplay.</li>
            <li> needed.&lt;br /&gt;The wig is also extremely easy to style.</li>
            <li> The hair falls out easily.</li>
            <li> but thats an easy fix</li>
            <li> The wig came I very quick.  </li>
            <li> Styling is super easy, you can get some great fluff, this is easily my favorite wig I own.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty full and has some nice layers, though I did have to add more</li>
            <li> Its really soft and is perfect for my cosplay ((Gamzee Makara from Homestuck))&lt;br /&gt;Its a bit shorter than I expected but its good ^^</li>
            <li> and I live in Alaska, so it was really surprising.</li>
            <li> If you know how to style then you might be fine.</li>
            <li> Not to mention it&#x27;s SUPER matted at the top.</li>
            <li> It did fit my 6 year old perfectly who also has a normal sized head.</li>
            <li> This is probably my new favorite wig that I own.</li>
            <li> This item arrived early and looked super great on.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s purpose well, and with a little product it was nearly perfect.</li>
            <li> wig would work good for Gamzee Makara I think, and it would also be great for Karkat Vantas, John Egbert, and Jake English (with some trimming and styling).&lt;br /&gt;I loved this wig so much that I actually bought another one</li>
            <li> and it came with a free wig cap</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t fit my head at all.</li>
            <li> This item also came with a free wig cap which is a plus since I didn&#x27;t have one.</li>
            <li> am happy with my order, but maybe the reason why it looks big on my head, is because of my curly, and frizzy hair.&lt;br /&gt;Warning:</li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t shed, even when shaking it out or lightly tugging on the locks.</li>
            <li> Had it fit, it may have worked for my needs, but the size just didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> so i know a cheap wig when i see one</li>
            <li> Perfect.thankyou for such a great product.</li>
            <li> It was really soft and actually really good with dealing with heat.</li>
            <li> Because of this it is very unstable even with bobbie pins, and sits on top of my head more like a hat than a wig.</li>
            <li> even came with black wig caps! :D</li>
            <li> I both agreed it&#x27;s more of a Kanaya wig if you style it right.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s beautiful and really good and all,but it&#x27;s really small,it fit my little sisters but not me.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s super easy to style</li>
            <li> The length was perfect, and it wasn&#x27;t too small, it fit snugly on my head.</li>
            <li> Not only did the wig come EARLY, but it also came with a free wig cap that fit perfectly.</li>
            <li> It is good for occasionally going out in cosplay, but the strands do fall out easily</li>
            <li> I love it so much!</li>
            <li> and it was super cheap feeling</li>
            <li> its nice and soft and pretty full for the most part but its shorter than pictured</li>
            <li> I love how this wig looks really realistic!</li>
            <li> The wig has minimal shine and is just great over all.</li>
            <li> what I liked about the wig was that it was soft.</li>
            <li> And its nice and soft.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice wig, it&#x27;s soft.</li>
            <li> The hair is course which is what I needed and the back is a good length.</li>
            <li> but I have to admit not a bad wig it also works well for a lot of the trolls in Homestuck</li>
            <li> Really nice wig, super soft and comfy.</li>
            <li> But other then that its great.</li>
            <li> great except for the frizzy fibers at the top which make it hard to part</li>
            <li> it super soft&lt;br /&gt;Perfect</li>
            <li> I love this wig, it fits for so many different cosplays!!!</li>
            <li> but the delievery time was super quick</li>
            <li> It feels silky smooth, and my family thought it was my real hair for a moment!</li>
            <li> Overall, very pleased with purchase.</li>
            <li> but I guess this is a warning to anyone with a bigger head than most - do measurements!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried it against heat quite yet, but it actually is made of heat-resistant fibers, so I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;ll be just fine.</li>
            <li> This wig worked perfectly for my cosplay of Red and Catwoman, although it turned out being a bit shorter than I expected.</li>
            <li> Well worth the $16</li>
            <li> This wig is nice for the price, very durable and soft.</li>
            <li> If you want this wig honestly just goto party city it will be the same quality.</li>
            <li> It came in a clear zip up bag and was in lovely condition.</li>
            <li> A bit shorter than expected, but overall a great wig!</li>
            <li> but well worth the wait.</li>
            <li> but I didn&#x27;t realize that it was to make a more natrual looking part minus a skin top.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ll get my money&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li> It was a good deal for the money I spent.</li>
            <li> High quality wig and easy to style.</li>
            <li> Which was excellent as I had just broke the only other one I had before hand.</li>
            <li> First off it came in really quick</li>
            <li> just right.</li>
            <li> You will have to work with this wig quite a bit to get it to look right.  </li>
            <li> The bangs can be styled pretty much any way you like and it looks fantastic.</li>
            <li> As for the positives, it isn&#x27;t very shiny, it&#x27;s a beautiful deep black color (I&#x27;ve seen &amp;#34;black&amp;#34; wigs before that looked more brown), and it came three days before it was supposed to be here.</li>
            <li> so it barely fit my already normal sized head.</li>
            <li> /&gt;You&#x27;re better off simply going to a wig shop and getting something worth the money that you can see and feel in your&lt;br /&gt;hands</li>
            <li> wig also arrived in the mail so fast, I&#x27;ve never had something from China get here so quickly.</li>
            <li> Really nice, thick at the top wig (Which is what I was aiming for).</li>
            <li> But other than that is a really great wig it really soft and silky</li>
            <li> But I absolutely adore it!</li>
            <li> It is exactly what she wanted it to be.</li>
            <li> I was joking at first, but when I took it off they were surprised).&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I can style it multiple ways and can&#x27;t wait to wear it more.</li>
            <li> Love this wig so much, especially for the price!</li>
            <li> (Im an avid cosplayer</li>
            <li> The only thing that I would think would bother someone is the parting on the top of the wig.</li>
            <li> I wore it to work as an April Fools joke and everyone thought it was my real hair!</li>
            <li> Looked ok, but unless you have a tiny head and or/are bald</li>
            <li> I bought mine to first of all</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit thinner than I thought but pretty sturdy.</li>
            <li> There wasn&#x27;t too much shine, it had just the right amount.</li>
            <li> working with this for a few minutes will make you high five yourself for making such a great deal!</li>
            <li> The bangs are very long so I my cut them but other than that it&#x27;s very good.</li>
            <li> I was really excited when I got this wig in the mail, it came REALLY early, which was awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It even has the really nice tighter in it to like all my other cosplay wigs.</li>
            <li> Im absolutely going to purchase more from this seller in the future.</li>
            <li> I got my last wig for cheaper, and  it&#x27;s much softer and fits better.     </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure about such a cheap wig, but I saw enough positive reviews.</li>
            <li> Literally if you just run your hands through it to make it messy, it&#x27;ll stay like that for the most part (which is great since Mituna has messy hair), if you want it to stay like that</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t exactly as it is pictured, much shorter in fact.</li>
            <li> It really doesn&#x27;t look like the picture much, however I&#x27;m sure with enough styling it will.  </li>
            <li> cut super super short</li>
            <li> I cut the front but the original length was super long so it gave you a lot of leeway to adjust it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really soft, not excessively shiny, and the hair can be easily styled (if you pull it/move it around, it stays very well).</li>
            <li> The wig cap is comfortable, which is a real plus because for me most wig caps are too small for</li>
            <li> so it was hard to get on at first but other than that its amazing!!!!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s honestly fits like a little kids</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s perfect for anime characters, all you need is a little hairspray, as its already cut into a choppy style.</li>
            <li> It did come with a wig cap, though I don&#x27;t really like the netted ones much</li>
            <li> It also isn&#x27;t curly like it says (it doesn&#x27;t really look curly in the picture, either), so it is straight, which I don&#x27;t mind at all.</li>
            <li> The wig was much shorted than depicted in the photo.</li>
            <li> It also flips and moves like real hair would.</li>
            <li> It also seems to shed quite a bit, so you&#x27;ll need to be gentle with it.</li>
            <li> Very well priced.</li>
            <li> Really shiny, I suggest dulling it if you use it for cosplay.</li>
            <li> Much shorter than it looks, as well.</li>
            <li> It doesnt hold to the heat very well.</li>
            <li> I recommend buying this wig if you have straight, and non curly hair.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really shed from what I&#x27;ve seen.</li>
            <li> The texture is silky and the shine and color are very realistic-looking.</li>
            <li> You should be gentle when handling it because while it has a lot of hair at times a tuft or two will come out.</li>
            <li> And Its Very Comfy To Ware .</li>
            <li> Very manageable.</li>
            <li> so it doesn&#x27;t really matter that much to me.</li>
            <li> shipping is fast and it&#x27;s really good！</li>
            <li> Hasn&#x27;t shed much, which is a plus.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m trying to send it back because it doesn&#x27;t even fit.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this wig for any cosplayer!</li>
            <li> The hair isn&#x27;t as much as I would like it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very good quality hair fibers and such, but very difficult to tell where the front is and everything, ALL of the hair is long, longer than I was expecting, but it is very nice and doesn&#x27;t shed much.</li>
            <li> bangs are SUPER long, but every wig I own came that way, so it&#x27;s to be expected.</li>
            <li> Very soft and shiny, but not fake looking like a Halloween-quality</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty soft and very realistic.  </li>
            <li> The top of the wig looks a little funny, but I guess I can&#x27;t complain for the price.</li>
            <li> Wayyyyy shorter than I expected and sheds a lot more than normal wigs.</li>
            <li> It arrived SUPER fast which was a big plus!</li>
            <li> very soft and thick and has good volume.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m wearing it right now, and it barely fits my head.</li>
            <li> /&gt;that&#x27;s not Amazon&#x27;s fault, but I can guarantee you that I&#x27;m never going to buy from this particular vendor again.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The black may seem a bit unreal to those with better eyes, however was able to convince a few friends that it was my real hair (on accident.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> It was nice and thick and the color is most certainly black.</li>
            <li> not a top notch wig, more like a very high end Halloween wig...</li>
            <li> I like this wig very much, soft and so real looking like hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty much like it is in the picture, except the actual feel and quality of the wig is sorta crappy.</li>
            <li> But that is quite normal for wigs.</li>
            <li> It had a bit to much shine at first, but once you play with it the extra shine goes away.</li>
            <li> but if I were using for multiple or long term I would be much more upset.</li>
            <li> and I have a normal sized head.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so soft and realistic looking.</li>
            <li> Good for L, as long as you have a small head.</li>
            <li> The fringe at the back of the wig really makes it look real, and it feels very soft.</li>
            <li> People keep thinking it&#x27;s real. o_o</li>
            <li> You can just kind of see the wefts slightly when the hair is swayed certain ways, but with a black wig cap on, which the wig came with, I don&#x27;t think it will be noticeable at all.</li>
            <li> Only because it will cost more trouble to send it back than what it is worth, I will be keeping it, albeit reluctantly.</li>
            <li> For such a small price was highly surprised at the amazing quality of the product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just a pain to cut them for me.&lt;br /&gt;Since the back is pretty layered, it is KIND OF thin.</li>
            <li> The wig I received was super thin and the mesh inside was of cheap material.</li>
            <li> Amazing quality wig ^.^ super thick the fibers were a bit thick and was difficult to style but other than that it was awesome.</li>
            <li> was completely blown off.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The bangs are long and cover my eyes, which is exactly what I</li>
            <li> Very itchy and gross feeling.</li>
            <li> Soft etc.</li>
            <li> It was short and sheds so much.</li>
            <li> Although this was easily fixed with a straighter and some adjusting it</li>
            <li> Oh, and if there are any negative reviews on this wig, I just think the person is trying to ruin the business, so don&#x27;t listen to them. :)</li>
            <li> I love this so much it arrived a week earlier than expected and it wasn&#x27;t too short or too long</li>
            <li> its great if you don&#x27;t want to do much styling, but it has a weird side part, and definitely wasnt as long or plush as the photo.</li>
            <li> The shipping time was good but the wig is very thin and has alot of spaces.</li>
            <li> I would say that if you&#x27;re planning on getting this wig, you should.&lt;br /&gt;Of course, I have had wigs in the past that were great at first and turned out to be horrible, but this one seems really nice.</li>
            <li> People who have know me a long time though it was my real hair</li>
            <li> The wig was incredibly small and wouldn&#x27;t fit over my head.</li>
            <li> I ordered this wig for Akaashi Keiji from Haikyuu because it look really full and fluffy like his hair</li>
            <li> Like some people have said, it is a little shorter than it looks in the picture, but luckily I needed it to be a bit shorter.</li>
            <li> I ordered this, and three other wigs on June 8th, and this one was the first to arrive.</li>
            <li> At first we were surprised by the shipping status that it was expected to several weeks after ordering, mid-November,  Ugh.  </li>
            <li> Very small as far as fit</li>
            <li> It was much shorter than the expected length, does not give enough room to fit my shoulder length hair into the cap, and causing it to only go down to the tip of my ears.</li>
            <li> I personally have no trouble with this, but the bangs cover alot of your face.</li>
            <li> It did arrive before Halloween unexpectedly, so I&#x27;ll give back a star for that.  </li>
            <li> There is barely any hair to it-</li>
            <li> The fibers are super thick and soft.</li>
            <li> or it might not fit quite right</li>
            <li> We bought a different cosplay wig from the Joker&#x27;s Wild, a local store, where we could check it out.</li>
            <li> This wig is really short and it barely fits my head</li>
            <li> wig!&lt;br /&gt;It is much like the picture, black with dark brown undertones in certain lighting.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s not even the right size, it&#x27;s exceedingly small, and does not fit.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It was to small and it didn&#x27;t have the right style.</li>
            <li> yes indeed it was a black wig but its MUCH shorter than the picture</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also not super shiny (Has about as much shine as real hair) and the hairs don&#x27;t fall out if you pull on them a little.</li>
            <li> The only real similarity is that they are black.</li>
            <li> my massive hair.&lt;br /&gt;The bangs are also super thick.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really thick and rough at the top, the bangs are also rough and had a lot of knots.</li>
            <li> My only complained is that a minute amount of hair fell off when I first put it on.</li>
            <li> Mixed in with the long heir is very short hair that is almost like velcro</li>
            <li> It was super short, and fairly thin.</li>
            <li> It shines kinda much, but that&#x27;s what synthetic fibre usually does.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very flat.</li>
            <li> I have VERY thick hair and its super long (below my bustline but not to my waist)</li>
            <li> so i doubt it will last long and its ITCHY!!!</li>
            <li> it seems like there&#x27;s a lot of hair on it, unlike the pink wig I purchased from the same seller.</li>
            <li> Excuse the lamp, it&#x27;s my makeshift wig stand.</li>
            <li> The hair isn&#x27;t long either.</li>
            <li> Also it&#x27;s not really soft at all.</li>
            <li> the bangs are a bit long as well as the sides</li>
            <li> /&gt;It was longer then expected and did have the one long bang type thing in the middle, and i didn&#x27;t think I&#x27;d have to trim it and style it myself.</li>
            <li> The wig is very soft and there&#x27;s only a very little amount of shine, but that&#x27;s to be expected with any wig.</li>
            <li> It seems that people ordering this item get different short black wigs all together since I compared mine with the customer photos</li>
            <li> Other than that I&#x27;m not an expert in styling but is that possible with this wig?</li>
            <li> I had very little material to work with as far as styling and considering how long I had to wait to receive it</li>
            <li> And its very long so I can style it the way I like.</li>
            <li> down the back of the neck at all as it&#x27;s shown in the photos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This wig is absolutely not what it&#x27;s shown to be.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to use it for a few future cosplays.</li>
            <li> or so I spent on it.</li>
            <li> The wig is thin and doesn&#x27;t have as much hair as it looks.</li>
            <li> Longer than expected.</li>
            <li> And it arrived sooner than expected.</li>
            <li> Despite what other people had said, my wig was a lot shorter than I had expected.</li>
            <li> Very thick wig, high quality fiber.</li>
            <li> This wig is small, but thankfully my hair is really short and wont be seen.</li>
            <li> its not exactly as pictured...</li>
            <li> It doesnt give a fake glow and alot of my friends thought it was real!</li>
            <li> The only reason for the missing star in my rating is because I felt the wig was a tad choppy.</li>
            <li> mainly because i got the wrong item, being long brown extensions instead of the black wig&lt;</li>
            <li> Mind you, this wig will need to be cut, as it has a style much like a stereotypical &amp;#34;emo&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I say kind of because it isn&#x27;t very bad at all.</li>
            <li> Other than that, works well!</li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;m also planning on using it for Gamzee, John, and probably some other Homestuck characters!</li>
            <li> the hair was stiff and rough</li>
            <li> The wig itself is very small, and it isn&#x27;t as long as I had expected.</li>
            <li> The wig is very small and very short.</li>
            <li> Even though it has slight problems like the hair falling out sometimes (just strands of it)</li>
            <li> it started shedding, but i have black hair</li>
            <li> Not only was I sent the WRONG WIG I have Not heard anything back from the sellers.</li>
            <li> do L from Deathnote, but also a black wig to go with kitty ears to be Luna from Sailor Moon.  </li>
            <li> , I will admit that I wasn&#x27;t too crazy about it when I first saw it inside the plastic bag.</li>
            <li> But, as I said, I&#x27;ll probably update this as I mess with it.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a little well poofy</li>
            <li> It took a little while to get here</li>
            <li> I expect a little shedding with wigs, but i had a few clumps come out when I was trying to style it.</li>
            <li> just takes a little while and few tugs to get it</li>
            <li> /make it messy to my liking.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve added it to a few fursuit commissions</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m like 12 and the wig does not fit at all, I was hoping to use it at my towns con because I was being John, but the wig doesn&#x27;t look at all like in the picture, also not even close to being an L wig.</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t reccomend it for any cosplay that requires a messy look, or</li>
            <li> anything fluffy.</li>
            <li> The hair quality is pretty bad.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it was very small and did not fit my 13 year old daughter&#x27;s head.  </li>
            <li> Comes in time but the wig itself is a little hard to style.</li>
            <li> Some shedding, but very little.  </li>
            <li> Then after already buying it, I went and read all of the bad reveiws and became really, really apprehensive.</li>
            <li> :/</li>
            <li> Like the others said it&#x27;s small</li>
            <li> The wig is small and shorter than the one that show in the picture.</li>
            <li> The wig was also really small</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s because I used Amazon Prime?    </li>
            <li> This wig they sent me was way to short and very very thin to the point as soon as i opened it  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not worth the money and the vendor is a cheapskate who prefers to give false advertising for their product.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s just hard to style.</li>
            <li> and it said it wouldn&#x27;t be in till late in January or beginning of February</li>
            <li> but my hair is thick</li>
            <li> Like Arda thick.</li>
            <li> I am disappointed and will be buying a new one from a wig site.</li>
            <li> you have to have a small thin head for it to look like that in the picture.</li>
            <li> the wig was very small, as well.</li>
            <li> Seriously.</li>
            <li> Very difficult to style L&#x27;s long spikes.</li>
            <li> Not sure if I just got the wrong one?</li>
            <li> course, styling and cutting in required/recommended as the fringe does reach to mine, and a previous buyer&#x27;s chin as well.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> , I was a bit annoyed.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s extremely thin.</li>
            <li> I have over 25 wigs and this one is by far the worst.</li>
            <li> It works, but it&#x27;s a bit thin and a bit difficult to style.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how they managed to send me the wrong wig</li>
            <li> The styling for this wig is extremely difficult.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry this isn&#x27;t a review, I just had to ask because I&#x27;ve seen a lot of bad reviews on this....</li>
            <li> I hate to write these reviews but this wig is a way worse quality than the picture.</li>
            <li> I am Very Angry.</li>
            <li> I rate 3 stars not because the wig is really bad.</li>
            <li> I can wear it, and it doesn&#x27;t too bad</li>
            <li> This was a bad product, my order came on time but the wig sheds a lot</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;ll use it for Karkat), but I have to say I&#x27;m disappointed.</li>
            <li> Way shorter than depicted very disappointed.</li>
            <li> This is the worst thing that I&#x27;ve bought from Amazon, and</li>
            <li> Yooo this wig is the worst wig I&#x27;ve ever order.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just awful don&#x27;t buy it.</li>
            <li> this wig was completely awful.</li>
            <li> but this product was horrible.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s pathetic.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I was really excited when I got this wig in the mail, it came REALLY early, which was awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, upon opening the package, I found that this wig was completely opposite of what&#x27;s advertised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hair is shiny, and cheap.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not even the right size, it&#x27;s exceedingly small, and does not fit.&lt;br /&gt;To top it all off, it&#x27;s not even the length that it&#x27;s advertised as. It&#x27;s a bob cut, or just to the chin, the length does not&lt;br /&gt;go down the back of the neck at all as it&#x27;s shown in the photos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I understand that wigs need styling when they come in the mail, it&#x27;s something that&#x27;s normal.&lt;br /&gt;This? This wig is absolutely not what it&#x27;s shown to be. This is the worst thing that I&#x27;ve bought from Amazon, and&lt;br /&gt;that&#x27;s not Amazon&#x27;s fault, but I can guarantee you that I&#x27;m never going to buy from this particular vendor again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;re better off simply going to a wig shop and getting something worth the money that you can see and feel in your&lt;br /&gt;hands before purchasing it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**Update**&lt;br /&gt;I contacted the vendor about the issues listed above.&lt;br /&gt;I was completely blown off.&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;The wig looks different under different kinds of light\\&quot; is what I was told.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely do not purchase this item. It&#x27;s not worth the money and the vendor is a cheapskate who prefers to give false advertising for their product.&lt;br /&gt;I would give it zero stars if the system would allow me to do so.</li>
            <li> Despite what other people had said, my wig was a lot shorter than I had expected. It would definitely not work for L from Death Note as the title suggests, so good thing I didn&#x27;t order it to cosplay as him. I plan on using it for Jeff the Killer from Creepypasta, but now I&#x27;m not so sure... It&#x27;s pretty small and it&#x27;s going to need a LOT more styling than I had planned. Good thing it seems like there&#x27;s a lot of hair on it, unlike the pink wig I purchased from the same seller. As for the positives, it isn&#x27;t very shiny, it&#x27;s a beautiful deep black color (I&#x27;ve seen &amp;#34;black&amp;#34; wigs before that looked more brown), and it came three days before it was supposed to be here. It did come with a wig cap, though I don&#x27;t really like the netted ones much and I probably won&#x27;t use it. Overall, it didn&#x27;t totally meet my expectations. I would maybe recommend it to a friend, though I wouldn&#x27;t buy it for them as a gift.</li>
            <li> It completed my costume perfectly. People who have know me a long time though it was my real hair it was that convincing!</li>
            <li> Not at all what it looks like in the picture... The wig I got was a women&#x27;s wig... Blunt cut bangs with a bob. I was going to use this for a male costume. :/ Not sure if I just got the wrong one? I gave it an extra star because it doesn&#x27;t shed. Excuse the lamp, it&#x27;s my makeshift wig stand.</li>
            <li> I ordered this wig to use for a Mituna Captor cosplay, and it is absolutely PERFECT. It&#x27;s so soft and realistic looking. It also isn&#x27;t curly like it says (it doesn&#x27;t really look curly in the picture, either), so it is straight, which I don&#x27;t mind at all. The bangs are long and cover my eyes, which is exactly what I needed.&lt;br /&gt;The wig is also extremely easy to style. Literally if you just run your hands through it to make it messy, it&#x27;ll stay like that for the most part (which is great since Mituna has messy hair), if you want it to stay like that then you can hairpspray or gel it and you&#x27;re good to go. I just didn&#x27;t spray it or anything so I can always flatten it/make it messy to my liking.&lt;br /&gt;This wig would work good for Gamzee Makara I think, and it would also be great for Karkat Vantas, John Egbert, and Jake English (with some trimming and styling).&lt;br /&gt;I loved this wig so much that I actually bought another one so I could trim and style it for Karkat.&lt;br /&gt;This wig also arrived in the mail so fast, I&#x27;ve never had something from China get here so quickly. It arrived 12 days after I placed my order- and I live in Alaska, so it was really surprising. It also came with a mesh wig cap.&lt;br /&gt;All in all, this product is amazing.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t exactly as it is pictured, much shorter in fact. But I absolutely adore it! Very very cute!</li>
            <li> Is this wig good for an L cosplay?  I&#x27;m sorry this isn&#x27;t a review, I just had to ask because I&#x27;ve seen a lot of bad reviews on this....</li>
            <li> I am sure I would love it if I ever had received it.</li>
            <li> Okay, so I had read all the good reviews and I bought the wig. Then after already buying it, I went and read all of the bad reveiws and became really, really apprehensive. But, when the wig came 11 days after I had first ordered it, I was very happy with it!&lt;br /&gt;You can&#x27;t see the netting underneath at all, and you can style it almost any way you like. If you run your fingers upward on it to make it puffy it will keep the puff without any hairspray and you still can&#x27;t see the netting. The bangs can be styled pretty much any way you like and it looks fantastic. It&#x27;s also not super shiny (Has about as much shine as real hair) and the hairs don&#x27;t fall out if you pull on them a little. It&#x27;s a really great wig and I&#x27;m super happy with it!</li>
            <li> First off it came in really quick so I was very happy about that and it came with a free wig cap but yeah.. Like the others said it&#x27;s small I recommend it to younger cosplayed with smaller heads. I&#x27;m 14 so I guess you get the picture.. Other than that I&#x27;m not an expert in styling but is that possible with this wig? I don&#x27;t know but what I liked about the wig was that it was soft. I guess you can fix the sizing by getting a tutorial of some sort..</li>
            <li> The wig was much shorted than depicted in the photo. I had very little material to work with as far as styling and considering how long I had to wait to receive it, I was a bit annoyed.</li>
            <li> Amazing quality for the price. My son is thrilled. Perfect for Gamzee in Homestuck.</li>
            <li> It looks more like a mullet in person than in this picture.</li>
            <li> Very itchy and gross feeling. Doesn&#x27;t style, and you can see the netting through the hair. Mixed in with the long heir is very short hair that is almost like velcro</li>
            <li> Perfect for John egbert or Karkat from homestuck! Love it. Just as pictured.</li>
            <li> I actually received a wig that was shorter than the picture shown. The only real similarity is that they are black. I don&#x27;t know how they managed to send me the wrong wig but they did.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with this wig~! I ordered it in December and it said it wouldn&#x27;t be in till late in January or beginning of February but it came in at the beginning of January which made me so happy when I found it in the mail~! And its nice and soft. And its very long so I can style it the way I like. It even has the really nice tighter in it to like all my other cosplay wigs. So this wig is perfect for my Karkat cosplay. But it would be good for L from Death Not as well.</li>
            <li> The wig is...okay. It&#x27;s pretty much like it is in the picture, except the actual feel and quality of the wig is sorta crappy. It&#x27;s really thick and rough at the top, the bangs are also rough and had a lot of knots. It also started shedding a bit, but I&#x27;ll just have to take extra care of it. It&#x27;ll have to do for now, I plan on using it for a Karkat cosplay at an upcoming con.</li>
            <li> The wig is very small and very short. The hair quality is pretty bad. It doesn&#x27;t fit my head at all. Don&#x27;t buy it.</li>
            <li> This wig worked perfectly for my cosplay of Red and Catwoman, although it turned out being a bit shorter than I expected. The fringe at the back of the wig really makes it look real, and it feels very soft. It also flips and moves like real hair would. I like it! :)</li>
            <li> It is good for occasionally going out in cosplay, but the strands do fall out easily</li>
            <li> I rate 3 stars not because the wig is really bad. The wig is quite good but it doesn&#x27;t look like in the picture. The wig is small and shorter than the one that show in the picture. If you know how to style then you might be fine.</li>
            <li> I ordered this wig for Akaashi Keiji from Haikyuu because it look really full and fluffy like his hair i just figured I would have to style the bang but i have to style everything. But other than that is a really great wig it really soft and silky just not what im personally looking for ^_^</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get the wig cap with it but I love the wig</li>
            <li> I bought this for a mannequin and it&#x27;s great. I can&#x27;t offer any opinions on wearing it tho.</li>
            <li> The wig was a bit different from its picture when I received it, but what wig at $5 isn&#x27;t? It&#x27;s pretty full and has some nice layers, though I did have to add more so it wasn&#x27;t as chunky/bulky. I also had to trim the bangs. It also seems to shed quite a bit, so you&#x27;ll need to be gentle with it. Despite that, it is a great, natural looking wig for every day use as well as cosplay. I&#x27;m planning on using mine for Mituna and Jane. &amp;#62;u&amp;#60;~</li>
            <li> I love this so much it arrived a week earlier than expected and it wasn&#x27;t too short or too long it fit perfectly and looked pretty good for my L cosplay</li>
            <li> My daughter will be wearing this as part of a costume. It is exactly what she wanted it to be.</li>
            <li> This was purchased for my son to cosplay at an anime convention.  He said it worked well, and comes with the hair net.  Very well priced.</li>
            <li> This is probably my new favorite wig that I own. I&#x27;m going to use it for a few future cosplays. Like some people have said, it is a little shorter than it looks in the picture, but luckily I needed it to be a bit shorter. It&#x27;s really soft, not excessively shiny, and the hair can be easily styled (if you pull it/move it around, it stays very well). I&#x27;m excited to use it!</li>
            <li> It was an okay wig, worked what I needed it for, but it shed a TON. I expect a little shedding with wigs, but i had a few clumps come out when I was trying to style it. Really shiny, I suggest dulling it if you use it for cosplay. Much shorter than it looks, as well.</li>
            <li> Love this wig can be shaped and typed easily. Easy to put on and looks great on.  Everyone loves it on me</li>
            <li> This item arrived early and looked super great on. This item also came with a free wig cap which is a plus since I didn&#x27;t have one. It was really soft and actually really good with dealing with heat. I give this 2 thumbs up.</li>
            <li> Comes in time but the wig itself is a little hard to style. It doesnt hold to the heat very well. Other than that, its an amazing wig and the shipping time is really great!</li>
            <li> The hair falls out easily.</li>
            <li> I had been thinking it would be a good length for Hiro Hamada, nope... it is great for Jane Crocker though</li>
            <li> I love it but my hair is thick so it was hard to get on at first but other than that its amazing!!!! :o)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an OK wig.&lt;br /&gt;However, it doesn&#x27;t look as it does in the picture.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll be getting my hair cut the way it does in the picture.&lt;br /&gt;I am happy with my order, but maybe the reason why it looks big on my head, is because of my curly, and frizzy hair.&lt;br /&gt;Warning: I recommend buying this wig if you have straight, and non curly hair.</li>
            <li> Really nice, thick at the top wig (Which is what I was aiming for). The black may seem a bit unreal to those with better eyes, however was able to convince a few friends that it was my real hair (on accident. I was joking at first, but when I took it off they were surprised).&lt;br /&gt;I also payed for expedited (I needed it in 4 days to be able to use it for an event and ordered at night; didn&#x27;t think it would make it) and it managed to get here on time!</li>
            <li> Very fine material. Haven&#x27;t tried the heat resistant -feature yet, but otherwise very good wig for cosplaying. It shines kinda much, but that&#x27;s what synthetic fibre usually does. Has a lot of fibre and great for spiking. Used for Shadow the Hedgehog -cosplay.</li>
            <li> The wig is perfect! I&#x27;m using it for my Marshall Lee cosplay and it looks great. Its nice and full. Doesn&#x27;t really shed from what I&#x27;ve seen. Would definitely buy from them again. Takes a bit to ship, but I expectef that, good time though.</li>
            <li> Very nice for the price.</li>
            <li> This wig is great and doesn&#x27;t appear to be too shiny, the texture is very soft.&lt;br /&gt;It was longer then expected and did have the one long bang type thing in the middle, and i didn&#x27;t think I&#x27;d have to trim it and style it myself. But other then that its great. Thank you.</li>
            <li> The wig came in about a week, which was wonderful. The texture is silky and the shine and color are very realistic-looking. It looks just like the image displayed. Well worth the $16 or so I spent on it.</li>
            <li> This wig is nice for the price, very durable and soft. I can style it multiple ways and can&#x27;t wait to wear it more. Definitely a great find!</li>
            <li> I had bought this wig for Gamzee Makara from homestuck, and I couldn&#x27;t be anymore please. Styling is super easy, you can get some great fluff, this is easily my favorite wig I own. I recommend this to anyone!</li>
            <li> not a top notch wig, more like a very high end Halloween wig...but it served it&#x27;s purpose well, and with a little product it was nearly perfect. Great for for the price, and I highly recommend it for cosplayers.</li>
            <li> This wig is great! I ordered it on the 6th and it came on the 18th. The wig is very soft and there&#x27;s only a very little amount of shine, but that&#x27;s to be expected with any wig. I haven&#x27;t tried it against heat quite yet, but it actually is made of heat-resistant fibers, so I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;ll be just fine. It also doesn&#x27;t shed, even when shaking it out or lightly tugging on the locks. It&#x27;s great! I fully recommend this purchase.</li>
            <li> Excellent quality. even came with black wig caps! :D</li>
            <li> The wig fits great, just be expected to cut it on your own! The style on the photo is not what you will receive. I personally have no trouble with this, but the bangs cover alot of your face. Other than that, works well!</li>
            <li> I ordered this, and three other wigs on June 8th, and this one was the first to arrive. (on june 20th)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Came faster than expected!&lt;br /&gt;It it super soft&lt;br /&gt;Perfect length&lt;br /&gt;Free wig cap&lt;br /&gt;Not to shiny&lt;br /&gt;Comfortable&lt;br /&gt;Covers back of head&lt;br /&gt;Fluffy&lt;br /&gt;Easy to work with&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;It didn&#x27;t arrive as shown in picture. But that is quite normal for wigs.I am going to style mine myself anyway so i don&#x27;t care.</li>
            <li> The wig was incredibly small and wouldn&#x27;t fit over my head. Had it fit, it may have worked for my needs, but the size just didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> The wig is thin and doesn&#x27;t have as much hair as it looks.You can also see the netting of the wig. The styling for this wig is extremely difficult. I couldn&#x27;t even style it basically.</li>
            <li> This was an awesome wig for the price and allowed me to have one in the right amount of time for a con. You should be gentle when handling it because while it has a lot of hair at times a tuft or two will come out. it&#x27;s not noticeably shiny like Halloween wigs and was easy to work with plus it came with a free wig cap! Posted a photo to show thickness and shine. I cut the front but the original length was super long so it gave you a lot of leeway to adjust it.</li>
            <li> Love this wig so much, especially for the price! It&#x27;s perfect for anime characters, all you need is a little hairspray, as its already cut into a choppy style.</li>
            <li> I use this wig for my Karkat Vantas cosplay and it looks perfect! It would also be great for Gamzee, John, or Jake!</li>
            <li> The wig I received was super thin and the mesh inside was of cheap material. It seems that people ordering this item get different short black wigs all together since I compared mine with the customer photos and it looked really different. The wig was also really small so it barely fit my already normal sized head. This is just a fraction of a step up from a party city wig.</li>
            <li> This wig was purchased for use at an office party. It got many nice compliments, and served its purpose as intended.</li>
            <li> yes indeed it was a black wig but its MUCH shorter than the picture and it was super cheap feeling the hair was stiff and rough so i doubt it will last long and its ITCHY!!! If you want this wig honestly just goto party city it will be the same quality. (Im an avid cosplayer so i know a cheap wig when i see one and this is fooling no one.)</li>
            <li> Not only did the wig come EARLY, but it also came with a free wig cap that fit perfectly. Heat resistant as promised, and the hair is simply amazing. It had a bit to much shine at first, but once you play with it the extra shine goes away. I love this wig, it fits for so many different cosplays!!! Im absolutely going to purchase more from this seller in the future.</li>
            <li> I got this wig just today and tried it on. I loved it so much! It feels silky smooth, and my family thought it was my real hair for a moment! I plan to use it in cosplay for Karkat from Homestuck, and use it for the Batter, from OFF. The wig has minimal shine and is just great over all. It came in a clear zip up bag and was in lovely condition. My only complained is that a minute amount of hair fell off when I first put it on. Mind you, this wig will need to be cut, as it has a style much like a stereotypical &amp;#34;emo&amp;#34; boy. Over all it is a great wig and I am VERY happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> The fibers are super thick and soft. They aren&#x27;t too shiny either. The top of the wig looks a little funny, but I guess I can&#x27;t complain for the price. The wig cap is comfortable, which is a real plus because for me most wig caps are too small for my massive hair.&lt;br /&gt;The bangs are also super thick. Like Arda thick.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s beautiful and really good and all,but it&#x27;s really small,it fit my little sisters but not me.It&#x27;s also not as spiky when you put it on.The hair isn&#x27;t long either. •-•</li>
            <li> I love how this wig looks really realistic! working with this for a few minutes will make you high five yourself for making such a great deal! The only thing that I would think would bother someone is the parting on the top of the wig. But it&#x27;s easily manageable!!</li>
            <li> I really love this wig. Even though it has slight problems like the hair falling out sometimes (just strands of it) or it might not fit quite right, I still like this wig, especially the quality of the hair.</li>
            <li> Beautiful! Very soft and shiny, but not fake looking like a Halloween-quality wig!&lt;br /&gt;It is much like the picture, black with dark brown undertones in certain lighting.&lt;br /&gt;Of course, styling and cutting in required/recommended as the fringe does reach to mine, and a previous buyer&#x27;s chin as well.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommended this wig to any cosplayer; whether is be for Homestuck, Death Note, etc.</li>
            <li> A bit shorter than expected, but overall a great wig! I love it so much! I use it for multiple cosplays and it doesnt shed!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a lot shorter than it looks in the picture. I bought this for Gamzee cosplay but soon after it arrived and I realized it was too short. Its still a good wig though. My Kanaya cosplaying friend and I both agreed it&#x27;s more of a Kanaya wig if you style it right.</li>
            <li> I honestly thought it would be longer and thicker. I was hoping to use it for Gamzee, but I don&#x27;t know if I can even pull off John. Not to mention it&#x27;s SUPER matted at the top. I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s because I used Amazon Prime?    Edit: I&#x27;m wearing it right now, and it barely fits my head. I can wear it, yeah, but I guess this is a warning to anyone with a bigger head than most - do measurements! Don&#x27;t make the same mistakes I make!    Also it&#x27;s not really soft at all. I got my last wig for cheaper, and  it&#x27;s much softer and fits better.     I can wear it, and it doesn&#x27;t too bad (I&#x27;ll use it for Karkat), but I have to say I&#x27;m disappointed.</li>
            <li> I got this for my titan eren and it was perfect for it.but as for an L wig it&#x27;s a little well poofy I guess but I have to admit not a bad wig it also works well for a lot of the trolls in Homestuck so you homestuck cosplayers this is the wig you want.</li>
            <li> The wig is not cut like the picture at all it&#x27;s more of a bob hair cut super super short I ordered this for my karkat and kankri cosplay and it didn&#x27;t work out since it was beyond to short but the delievery time was super quick so that&#x27;s a good note</li>
            <li> This was a bad product, my order came on time but the wig sheds a lot and it&#x27;s way too short plus it didn&#x27;t even look like the wig in the picture.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very good quality hair fibers and such, but very difficult to tell where the front is and everything, ALL of the hair is long, longer than I was expecting, but it is very nice and doesn&#x27;t shed much.</li>
            <li> mainly because i got the wrong item, being long brown extensions instead of the black wig&lt;br /&gt;i cannot say anything else besides that</li>
            <li> Quality of wig was excelkent, especially for the price. It took a little while to get here but well worth the wait.</li>
            <li> i got this wig for mituna captor and its perfect! the bangs are a bit long as well as the sides but thats an easy fix uwu</li>
            <li> The Wig Came Earlier Then The Estimate Time , It Looks Great And Its Very Comfy To Ware .</li>
            <li> I like this wig very much, soft and so real looking like hair. Very manageable. My son was very happy with this wig. Perfect.thankyou for such a great product.</li>
            <li> Really nice wig, super soft and comfy. Came with a wig cap (nice cuz I managed to lose mine). Really nice length and easy to style!</li>
            <li> I got the wig in a pretty good time period but when i opened it, it had already begun to shed.</li>
            <li> High quality wig and easy to style.</li>
            <li> Really good quality for the price. People keep thinking it&#x27;s real. o_o</li>
            <li> Yooo this wig is the worst wig I&#x27;ve ever order. I have over 25 wigs and this one is by far the worst. It looked like it had heat damage? It&#x27;s just awful don&#x27;t buy it. Seriously. Like no.</li>
            <li> I love it~ I wear it all the time and it&#x27;s super easy to style It&#x27;s one of my favorite wigs~</li>
            <li> I hate to write these reviews but this wig is a way worse quality than the picture. I am disappointed and will be buying a new one from a wig site. But you get what you pay for, and I guess I did</li>
            <li> This wig is small, but thankfully my hair is really short and wont be seen. If you have longer than ear length hair. Do not purchase.</li>
            <li> The wig has really good texture and thickness, and it&#x27;s not weirdly shiny. However, if you have a larger head like me, it may not go on all the way.</li>
            <li> It was much shorter than the expected length, does not give enough room to fit my shoulder length hair into the cap, and causing it to only go down to the tip of my ears. Because of this it is very unstable even with bobbie pins, and sits on top of my head more like a hat than a wig. I would not buy this again, or recommend anyone to buy this. Only because it will cost more trouble to send it back than what it is worth, I will be keeping it, albeit reluctantly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a pretty good wig for what you pay, and has a lot of hair so you can style it to your liking. But it DEFINITELY doesn&#x27;t come as neat and tamed as in the picture XP</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice wig, but I recommend this for any homestucks who cosplay: John, Jake, Jane, Karkat, Kankri, amd Signless. I got this for my Kanaya thinking that this would be perfect for her, it&#x27;s not. you have to have a small thin head for it to look like that in the picture. it started shedding, but i have black hair so it doesn&#x27;t really matter that much to me. Just saying, this wig is smaller than what it looks.</li>
            <li> I got it yesterday. Its really soft and is perfect for my cosplay ((Gamzee Makara from Homestuck))&lt;br /&gt;Its a bit shorter than I expected but its good ^^</li>
            <li> this wig was completely awful. The shipping time was good but the wig is very thin and has alot of spaces. It looks nothing like the wig in the picture and i wouldn&#x27;t recommend buying it.</li>
            <li> shipping is fast and it&#x27;s really good！</li>
            <li> Extremely good for the price. I wore it to work as an April Fools joke and everyone thought it was my real hair! The bangs are very long so I my cut them but other than that it&#x27;s very good. Soft etc.</li>
            <li> It works, but it&#x27;s a bit thin and a bit difficult to style.</li>
            <li> Good quality,  has stood up to repeated washings and hot iron straightenings. Looks good on my kid&#x27;s head. Many peaople had no clue it was a wig, they thought she straightened her hair like her sister&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Wig is as pictured, and wears well.  It&#x27;s pretty soft and very realistic.  Some shedding, but very little.  Overall, very pleased with purchase.</li>
            <li> The wig itself is very small, and it isn&#x27;t as long as I had expected. Very difficult to style L&#x27;s long spikes.</li>
            <li> Wayyyyy shorter than I expected and sheds a lot more than normal wigs. Not a terrible product but if I were using for multiple or long term I would be much more upset. Get whatcha pay for though.</li>
            <li> Did not arrive in time for pac con but arrived right before Halloween! :D I absolutely love how perfectly it fits and its so comfortable! Absolutely perfect for my John cosplay!</li>
            <li> Very good :3 use it for basic cosplay and I&#x27;ve added it to a few fursuit commissions</li>
            <li> looks longer on mannequin then on person...very short on human head..</li>
            <li> great except for the frizzy fibers at the top which make it hard to part</li>
            <li> At first we were surprised by the shipping status that it was expected to several weeks after ordering, mid-November,  Ugh.  I didn&#x27;t realize it was coming from China.  It did arrive before Halloween unexpectedly, so I&#x27;ll give back a star for that.  Unfortunately, it was very small and did not fit my 13 year old daughter&#x27;s head.  I tried it on and it was definitely *not* adult-sized.  Looked ok, but unless you have a tiny head and or/are bald you may be out of luck.  You get what you pay for.  We bought a different cosplay wig from the Joker&#x27;s Wild, a local store, where we could check it out.</li>
            <li> I wish I hadn&#x27;t purchased this wig. It was short and sheds so much. I didn&#x27;t even use it but instead threw it out. You get what you pay for I guess.</li>
            <li> This wig is super cute! its not exactly as pictured...its nice and soft and pretty full for the most part but its shorter than pictured so that&#x27;s why I only gave It 4 stars. But it still works well and is a very nice wig at an amazing price! It arrived SUPER fast which was a big plus! :-D I have VERY thick hair and its super long (below my bustline but not to my waist) and I was still able to stuff it all underneath the wig and you cant see it at all. Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This wig was perfect for my L cosplay. For such a small price was highly surprised at the amazing quality of the product. A plus would be that this wonderful wig also came with a cap! Which was excellent as I had just broke the only other one I had before hand. The only reason for the missing star in my rating is because I felt the wig was a tad choppy. Although this was easily fixed with a straighter and some adjusting it just takes a little while and few tugs to get it just right. If you are still thinking about it, go ahead and purchase!</li>
            <li> Not only was I sent the WRONG WIG I have Not heard anything back from the sellers. I am Very Angry. This wig they sent me was way to short and very very thin to the point as soon as i opened it  clumps of hair had fallen out. not strands CLUMPS .  I will NOT buy from this seller again .</li>
            <li> I ordered the wig on the 4th and got it on the 16th! Just in time for an anime convention! When I got it, I was very pleased. The length was perfect, and it wasn&#x27;t too small, it fit snugly on my head. There wasn&#x27;t too much shine, it had just the right amount. If you are cosplaying Mituna from Homestuck I definitely recommend this wig, as it covers the eyes just perfectly, like Mituna&#x27;s hair does. Oh, and if there are any negative reviews on this wig, I just think the person is trying to ruin the business, so don&#x27;t listen to them. :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m like 12 and the wig does not fit at all, I was hoping to use it at my towns con because I was being John, but the wig doesn&#x27;t look at all like in the picture, also not even close to being an L wig.</li>
            <li> It was shorter than the picture shows.</li>
            <li> Longer than expected. Got this for john it looks like terezi or nepeta</li>
            <li> It was nothing like the picture.</li>
            <li> The wig came in and it does NOT look like the one in the picture. I bought this for my boyfriend for a Marshall Lee cosplay. When he put it on he looked like one of the beetles. It&#x27;s a nice wig, it&#x27;s soft. But it&#x27;s not what I was expecting and it&#x27;s just hard to style.</li>
            <li> Amazing quality wig ^.^ super thick the fibers were a bit thick and was difficult to style but other than that it was awesome. The cap was constructed nicely. The roots were knotted but I didn&#x27;t realize that it was to make a more natrual looking part minus a skin top.</li>
            <li> It works nicely, it&#x27;s heat resistant, it&#x27;s a pleasant looking wig, fits well, and it came with a free wig cap.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my daughters cos-playing. She&#x27;s happy , so that made me happy that I picked a decent wig. Hasn&#x27;t shed much, which is a plus. And it arrived sooner than expected.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure about such a cheap wig, but I saw enough positive reviews. You will have to work with this wig quite a bit to get it to look right.  It really doesn&#x27;t look like the picture much, however I&#x27;m sure with enough styling it will.  This is an awesome wig because if you like to cosplay anime characters, you can use it for so many characters. I bought mine to first of all do L from Deathnote, but also a black wig to go with kitty ears to be Luna from Sailor Moon.  Them my frien pointed out it would be great for Mikasa from AoT. So I&#x27;ll get my money&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li> So the wig got here at the time it said it would which was good. It&#x27;s a bit thinner than I thought but pretty sturdy. The hair is course which is what I needed and the back is a good length. The only thing is the front is a lot different than in the picture I&#x27;ll probably have to cut it a bit but otherwise it&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li> Before I continue, I just got this wig today, so this is sort of a &amp;#34;first impressions&amp;#34; kind of review. I may update it once I&#x27;ve messed with it and worn it a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, as I said, I just got it today and it wasn&#x27;t scheduled to be here until some time in September. I was so glad to have gotten it before September!&lt;br /&gt;Now, I will admit that I wasn&#x27;t too crazy about it when I first saw it inside the plastic bag. It just didn&#x27;t look like what I wanted at all. However, once I pulled it out and got it on my head, I was so pleasantly surprised!&lt;br /&gt;Where do I even begin! I bought this intently for the purpose of cosplaying an OC of mine, who&#x27;s hair is flipped out on the sides. This wig is BEYOND perfect for that! It flips out so beautifully once you have it on! Now I&#x27;m also planning on using it for Gamzee, John, and probably some other Homestuck characters! I will say that, since it&#x27;s so flipped out, you may have to straighten it for certain characters, but it feels like good material, so I don&#x27;t see that as being a problem.&lt;br /&gt;The bangs are SUPER long, but every wig I own came that way, so it&#x27;s to be expected. It&#x27;s just a pain to cut them for me.&lt;br /&gt;Since the back is pretty layered, it is KIND OF thin. I say kind of because it isn&#x27;t very bad at all. You can just kind of see the wefts slightly when the hair is swayed certain ways, but with a black wig cap on, which the wig came with, I don&#x27;t think it will be noticeable at all. I just can&#x27;t tell you how beautiful I think it looks! I would say that if you&#x27;re planning on getting this wig, you should.&lt;br /&gt;Of course, I have had wigs in the past that were great at first and turned out to be horrible, but this one seems really nice. But, as I said, I&#x27;ll probably update this as I mess with it.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted perfect you get what you see!!! So many to choose from but this was perfect I can use it for many characters!</li>
            <li> my daughter love this wig.  The color was beautiful and the way it was cut.  My daughter just loves every thing about this wig.  She is so happy.... The wig came I very quick.  We will buy from here again.</li>
            <li> This was not the wig I wanted. It was to small and it didn&#x27;t have the right style. I love Amazon but this product was horrible. I&#x27;m trying to send it back because it doesn&#x27;t even fit. It&#x27;s a kids wig!! If I could give this wig a zero I would.</li>
            <li> The wig came sooner then said, which was nice. Like most cosplay wigs, it did not come styled and had a bit of a swoopy fringe. It was nice and thick and the color is most certainly black. Very nice wig.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my Karkat and Gamzee cosplay, but I have yet to receive it, although I hope when it comes I will fall in love with it. Tomorrow is the last day I&#x27;m supposed to receive it, let&#x27;s hope I get it then!</li>
            <li> Way shorter than depicted very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Very thick wig, high quality fiber. Shipping time was great, I think it was estimated to take a month to arrive, but received it in a week. I would highly recommend this wig for any cosplayer!</li>
            <li> This wig took a while to come in, and when it finally did, it was WAY to short. It didn&#x27;t look like the wig in the picture. There is barely any hair to it- it&#x27;s extremely thin. I don&#x27;t like the material of the wig at all, and it is not that silky either.</li>
            <li> the picture was diffrent than the actual wig itself. i used it for karkat vantas after i had it styled it was okay. the back was thinner than the front.</li>
            <li> very soft and thick and has good volume. The only thing is it is not quite as long&lt;br /&gt;i bought it for karkat and am currently using it for him and zacharie (from off)</li>
            <li> It was super short, and fairly thin. its great if you don&#x27;t want to do much styling, but it has a weird side part, and definitely wasnt as long or plush as the photo. the wig was very small, as well. i don&#x27;t reccomend it for any cosplay that requires a messy look, or anything fluffy. it&#x27;s very flat.</li>
            <li> The hair isn&#x27;t as much as I would like it but if you tweak it a bit it you can get what you want.&lt;br /&gt;I used this for Kaneki Ken from tokyo ghoul too. It doesnt give a fake glow and alot of my friends thought it was real!</li>
            <li> This wig is really short and it barely fits my head it&#x27;s honestly fits like a little kids wig.when I took it out of the package clumps of hair fell out . The hair on the wig feels like plastic it&#x27;s pathetic.</li>
            <li> Not the same hair style as the one pictured. Very small as far as fit and I have a normal sized head. It did fit my 6 year old perfectly who also has a normal sized head. I guess as the saying goes, you get what you pay for. I don&#x27;t recommend. I&#x27;d give it 1 star but I gave it to my kids for their dress up and pretend clothes so I was able to find another use.</li>
            <li> It was a good deal for the money I spent.</li>
            <li> great quality, soft, and very easily styled ! used it for kankri vantas and kurloz makara :&amp;#62;</li>
            <li> Good for L, as long as you have a small head.</li>
    </ol>
